I wandered in here after a day at the library with my mom, sister, and my niece and nephew. Adorable-love the retro vibe. The junk on the walls is enough to keep me distracted until my food arrives and the waitresses looked awesome, in their retro outfits. Prices were decent and the food was pretty good. I definitely want to go back and try the ice cream.

STOP CALLING MY HOME. Adobe Carpet Cleaning got my phone number somehow, even though I'm on the do not call registry. They call, almost every day, at dinner time. I've told them to take me off their calling list immediately, and guess what? They call, again and again. I don't even HAVE any carpeting!!!!  I've filed a complaint with the FTC to get the calls to stop.  I cannot stand companies who use these horrid tactics to phish for business.  Stay away.

Flamingo Palace is the closest thing to East Coast Chinese food I've found. The house chicken is super tasty and they have really yummy rice. Yes it's a little worn inside and that fish in the tank needs a bigger tank, but it's well worth a visit. Delivery was also very quick.

This place needs a serious face lift and air freshener. It's seriously run down..in a "we opened and never did anything else" sort of way. I had tried going to 5 other nail places yesterday after work (in Scottsdale and Phoenix)because I have no time the rest of the week, and every single place was crowded, so this was my final spot before giving up. Note to self, make an appointment! It was fairly empty-1 person getting a mani and 1 person getting a pedi. It smelled like..well, urine. It could have been food, or the smell of their ac unit, but it smelled musky and down right stinky. In my desperation, I hung out for a bit because the person did greet me very nicely..I watched while they disinfected the pedi tub so it put me at ease after watching the thorough cleaning. The person I got wore gloves, used instruments from a sealed bag ..so all the cleanliness was a definite A plus. The ped chairs have seen better days, but the chair massage was awesome. The scrub they used on my legs was fantastic, and  I really got  a great pedicure-despite the sketchy appearance of the joint, the service and friendliness of the nail technician were a definite positive. I didn't feel rushed at all. I tend to go to places and feel like they are just desperate to get you out of the chair (well no one was waiting...so that might have been a contributing factor)! Anyway..hygiene practices are a definite 2 thumbs up. I find all AZ pedicures incredibly over priced..which is why I'm rating this as moderate.

This location is very close to our house. Great customer service with James..super friendly and makes the whole process quick and easy. If I had to complain there is no shade so when you pick up your car, the interiors are boiling hot in the summer (eek)! Besides that...I can't complain. We've used this location at least 3 times this summer with no problems.

I've driven past here a million times to have coffee at True Brew; how have I not stopped in before?! It's smack in the middle of a strip mall-so you'd almost miss it if you didn't know it was there. We went on a Friday night and it was jam packed.  We sat out on the patio, which does a great job of disguising it's parking lot with black out shades. A great family vibe, and really tasty thin crust pizza (I had the marguerita pizza..so good)!! Definitely a new fave pizza spot for me.

I'm not embarrassed to say I love Domino's. Ok, maybe a little embarrassed, but there, I've said it. This location is across the street from me, and gets a bunch of stars for location alone. I tend to have some issues with cheese (darn lactose intolerance)-but the thin crust here, with their mild sauce, does not give me any indigestion whatsoever. I can indulge on their stuff whenever!! I love to add the philly cheese steak on there too, with diced tomatoes. It's a crispy, fun filled combo for me.  Delivery is always lightening fast (probably cause I live so close, but whatever).

Food City is your typical latino market..I grew up in Northern NJ, where we had a million littlle spots that looked just like this one. The exception, is there is very little south american or carribbean labels..until now. I've had a hard time adjusting to food shopping in AZ-I've searched far and wide because most products are geared toward the Mexican population, which I totally get, but hey, there are other latinos out here too! I walk into Food City, and I'm totally overwhelmed with joy-they now carry most of the Goya line. For us east coast latinos...it's a blessing like you wouldn't believe. Sure, the prices are inflated compared to back east (why is nectar goya almost $2?!), but being able to buy them local vs having my relatives ship me boxes of Goya products is fantastic!!  Thank you Food City, for realizing other latinos need our Goya stuff :)

I registered for Travel Pro luggage when I got married several years ago. The bags have been really sturdy, lasting through a honeymoon, a few vacations, and a move across country.  I needed to have a bit of repair work on them before our next trip, and looked on the travel pro website for an authorized repair shop. The only one in the Phoenix area that was authorized, is Mark's Luggage. I hesitated for a couple of days only because of the distance; but figured the bags have been good to me, so it was worth the drive.  What was even better was they are open on Saturday until Noon.  Service was GREAT. Very friendly-and promised our bags in week or so. Our bags were done in a couple of days!! Even better, our warranty covered the repair (who knew)?!! again, so glad I went with an authorized repair shop. Easy pick up and no nonsense service. I'll be going to Mark's for any future luggage repairs.

I love this Barnes and Noble. It is always neat and inviting and great service at the Starbucks cafe.  Yes the bathrooms here both are labeled with changing tables, for both the mens and womens rooms (hooray) but at the same time, the tables are dirty.   My husband left the mens room with our daughter all twitchy from how dirty the changing table seemed.

I registered at both the combo Toys R Us/Babies R Us store by my house (on Bell Rd) and finished up at this location, since it had a larger variety. Nice goody bag, ample selection of items.  Furniture prices are over inflated, but that seems typical for all baby furniture.  You get lots of coupons too once you sign up for their rewards program which come in really handy!  There are changing tables in the restrooms as well as fantastic mother's rooms..which have a rocker, sofa, and changing tables, as well as wipes, diapers, etc. Great for breastfeeding discreetly!

This salon is close to my job and is your standard nail place as far as decor goes. No frills. The customer service though, is pretty fantastic. You're greeted with a smile and the girls are all very attentive. I walked in after work and there was no wait. Chair was clean and the tools were sealed in a bag. The standard pedi had warmed lotion and a stone massage. Not sure about the stone thing..I don't know the benefits have having a hot rock on my leg, but it the warm lotion was a nice touch. Lee was chatty and friendly. she gave me a punch card for future use, which is also a nice touch. Their hours are convenient too, open until 7pm.  It's a great option for me when I need to go somewhere near work versus my usual spot.

I've had a terrible time finding a trustworthy dentist. My husband's insurance coverage was for an HMO, and our choices were horrific. My employer suggested I try Dr. Shwartz. I'm so happy I did-he was kind enough to explain why our dental coverage stunk (very eye opening), and what I needed to have done. There was no attempt to up sell, or suggest other things that I may need. He was super honest and friendly. HIs staff is fantastic!! You're greeted by name when you walk in, and made super comfortable; you can even watch tv while you're getting work done.

When I think of bagel places, I think of those deli like hole in the walls that are on every single corner in NY & NJ-where they fry the bacon and eggs right in front of you. Since arriving in AZ, my only options include Einstein bagels(not bad..but their egg sandwiches stink), Supermarket bagels (boo) and Dunkin Donuts, which are nowhere close to me to even be an option. This place is literally around the corner from my job. I had no idea it was in this strip mall (shocking). It feels like a real bagel place!! I had a wonderful poppy seed bagel with egg, bacon and provolone. It has some seating, is clean, and very friendly staff. Nothing out of the ordinary with the decor, but I'm so excited to find this place that I can't wait to go back.

This was my first time at a small/community theater. I had such a great time! I went to see "And Then There Were None" by Agatha Christie. Great cast..loved that everyone used a British accents. I got my tickets through an email for "show up". We had 2nd row. The sound was great, effects were great. The employees were really very helpful and the show was very well acted. If I had a small complaint, the entrance is a bit uninviting. The doors that lead into the lobby look like plain, gray doors, so I wasn't sure if that was the actual entrance or not. I also liked that the restrooms and water fountains were right in the theater. Very convenient.

The last time I went roller skating was probably 1987, at Skaters World in Wayne, NJ. My sister invited me this past Saturday afternoon and I was no disappointed. All that was missing were some acid washed jeans and scrunchy socks to complete my trip back into the 80s. We had a great time! IT was PACKED. There were tons of birthday parties so my only real complaint was the lack of tables and food. They literally were out of hot dogs and pizza for non party skaters (insane, we had nachos. boo). The music was great, the dj was fantastic with getting the kids involved, and the training skate mate rental for the little kids was great. We'll be back :)

I've got a 2 part review here based on birthing my lovely baby in July of 2012-here goes.  Part one: Hospitals in AZ are very different than NJ hospitals. I am pretty amazed at the lack of security. Back home..you cant cross any point of a hospital without a visitor pass. I've been to 3 hospitals here, and no one needs a pass to get anywhere. I find it weird, but alas..this really is just a quick observation at the ease of getting into hospital rooms in this state. Anyway..back to my review! Banner Thunderbird was pretty awesome. I took a tour of the birth facilities during my pregnancy and was at ease immediately. Clean and sparkly, without it feeling like a sterile ugly hospital. The tour clearly explained every aspect from checking in, to where you go at each stage, and included tours of the rooms, OR, etc.  We were also encouraged to go online and view the classes they offered-I chose a breastfeeding class-which again, was super helpful.  Part two: In general, I can't say enough about the amazing nursing staff at Banner, all for the exception of one lousy nurse. This is why I can't give it 5 stars. That one terrible nurse, ruined my experience so badly, I wanted to leave, IMMEDIATELY. I'll get to that. I was induced because I have a lazy baby who was far too comfortable in my womb. Every single nurse in the labor area was superb. every single step was explained to me in detail..all my needs were cared for..I was made comfortable in every way possible. The anesthesiologists that cared for me were also superb..explaining everything in detail.  My husband received a great deal of attention after our delivery with the nursing staff..again, fantastic, fantastic care. Piper, who was one of my nurses in the maternity area after our munchkin arrived was fantastic..I can't say enough about how much she took care of me. Great nurse!! So, on day 4 of my stay (I had a c-section..bah)..anyway..I had a super inconsiderate nurse. WHo scolded me for not nursing enough. Who NEVER recommended I see the lactation specialist, never provided me with the proper care to ensure i was nursing correctly. Other than to yell at me and say "you are not feeding the baby enough". I was LIVID I wanted out..immediately. I think I remember her name, but in my anger, and drug induced foggy brain, I can't say for sure, or else I would have written a letter of complaint. IN SHORT. Yes, I loved the hospital..it was a great experience overall, for the exception of one idiotic nurse. If I had to suggest something for them to fix immediately..offer lactation care to every breast feeding mother. We shouldn't have to "tell" you to do that. Your caring for ME..I just sprung a baby from my loins..help a girl out.

I really should have known better-being that I was spoiled in NJ with such fantastic italian food. Once again, another restaurant (chain or family owned) that does not offer chicken francaise! What do I have to do to find some chicken francaise in AZ?! Anyway..food was bland-you have to order pasta seperately? really??? It's not included? what italian place doesn't give you a smidge of pasta? Even olive garden gives you some pasta! Oh well..server was great, so I gave the extra star for the super waiter and I actually love all the kitchy stuff on the walls.

This location is open the latest in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. I believe Friday/Saturday they are open until 11, while most of the other stores are open until 10pm.  The lovely area upstairs near the windows is a nice spot to read or discreetly nurse your baby (just sayin).  Changing tables in both men & women's rest rooms are a plus too.

I loved it.  I've wanted to go here ever since we moved to AZ and I wasn't disappointed. It's HUGE! We didn't even get to see the whole place-as a former photography major I was super excited to see the Ansel Adam exhibit. free on First friday of every month. I'm so ready to come back and see what I missed. Loved the vibe and I agree with everyone else..I'm not an artsy sort of person, but I really was in awe of this place. What a wonderful place to have in Phoenix. 3 hrs flew by-I could spend the whole day there.

Mmmm mmmm!! That is some delicious, succulent chicken!  I went to Lo-Lo's on a Monday night and it was packed; we were seated immediately in  a little room in the back called the chicken coop. Adorable! I had grape Kool Aid in a mason jar (giant jars) and probably much too sweet for me though. I also had the Lil Amadi (that may be misspelled) which was 2 pieces of wonderful chicken and a fluffy waffle. SO good. The chicken was no greasy at all. We also had potatoes, biscuits and cole slaw that we shared at our table.  Service was slow, but completely understandable with every single table full. Great meal, servers were friendly and the prices were reasonable.  The restaurant has a parking lot which was full but we found parking right on the side street next to the building.

I got a menu on my doorknob and decided to order delivery because they just about had everything on the menu; from pizza, to mexican, to hot dogs. I found their delivery charges to be a lot-$2 and then I also saw on the menu that they add $1 if you dine in. Who does that??? It seems tacky to nickle and dime your customers that way. Our food was ok-my hot dog was great, though my husband said his meatball parm was just ok. Our french fries were dry and over fried. No idea what the actual place looks like but with our meh delivery experience, it doesn't really make a difference to me. I'll pass on this one.

When I came to Phoenix from NJ,  one of the things that shocked me the most was the complete lack of South American and Caribbean cuisine. Until now!  I'm Colombian, so when I looked over the menu and found such familiar foods as patacones and bandeja paisa, Colombianas, and batidas de guanabana, I felt like I was home. Dont expect fast service. There is one waiter. It really is a mom & pop run establishment. no small talk while we were there..he took our order and off he went. The prices were reasonable and they had a lot of fun soda-inca cola and Colombiana which are pretty hard to find here. Patacones (fried plantain) were deeeeelisssshhh! Just like you can find at any latin restaurant back east. All in all fantastic food, great menu items, and no nonsense service. Tasty, and we'll be back!

This review is strictly for the portrait studio. One word..CHAOS.  I received a gift session and I was more than happy to get my daughter's first Christmas cards done. It was a mad house from the second we stepped into the studio.  I understand it's the holiday season; I get it..really I do. But booking a session at a certain time, should fall within that time-give or take 10-15 minutes. NOT 90 minutes after that time.  I had a 5 month old infant with me..and lets say she wasn't happy sitting around, waiting for 90 minutes, to get a very sour, overworked, and probably really tired photographer.  No guidance, no instruction or attempts by this person to work with my kid. Plop child on this dot, snap picture. Yes my daughter was fussy..but YOU guys were late..what happens? I ask if I can feed her, only to learn, that our slot has been taken and we have to wait again. WHAT?!  Now, our second photographer was a thousand times better which is why I added another star. He really did all he could to get our daughter to smile without seeming angry or bored, or upset. But like I said, 90 minutes with a child waiting, and your not going to get a happy baby in pictures. The person who then tries to pick poses and templates with you was just not...professional. She was suggesting the most horrid pictures possible. Nightmare!  I stuck around because it was a gift, and I was not going to be ungrateful, but I will not be using this studio ever again.

How cute is this place?! It's a bit of a hike to Cave Creek, but we wanted a change from our regular routine. We headed to the Oak's Diner on a Sunday morning-not too crowded and we were told to seat ourselves. Very friendly waitress and plenty of seating. Feels like a diner for sure. Great menu and very reasonably priced.

What's not to like about Delux?! I had a tasty turkey burger, which was nicely seasoned (you know turkey burgers can be on the dry side). We had the mixture of sweet potato fries and regular fries, which come with that yummy sauce. We sat at that long middle table, which is awesome with the lights (loved the under table hooks for purses..nice touch). Quick service, fun place-good food. Love the late hours-it's not easy to find late dining in Phoenix.

Performance art by men who's faces are blue and don't speak. I was entertained-there are some giggle inducing moments and some really cool things, but I really wasn't quite sure what the point of it all was. It's more of a drumming concert with some performance art thrown in-sprinkled with a tad of audience participation. Not something I would recommend or see again.

While looking up a menu for a different restaurant, we realized it was Arizona Restaurant week. We skimmed through the list of other places and called for a reservation. we were told it wasn't necessary for a Saturday night, that it was about a 15 min wait, so off we went! We didn't even wait..we were seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty full. It was LOVELY. Such a pretty restaurant. Nice, friendly service and a beautiful patio. We sat outdoors and it was great. A nice selection of music was playing and it was just a great vibe. Yes it was loud, but in a fun way. We ate off the AZ restaurant week menu-salad, short ribs and red velvet cake. All AMAZING!! The short ribs were super tender and the dessert was perfect. Pretty restrooms too :) Can't wait to go back!

Overhyped? What am I missing here? I was very excited about checking out Matt's. We went on a Sunday morning, so I expected a long wait (I even brought a book). There was about an hour wait ahead of us, so I was already happy it wasn't longer than that. The exterior is cute. I was already giving the place a point on style alone and because the interior is oh-so tiny!  They had some retro looking fans going-we ended up sitting in the rear room. I had the eggs and sausage, with wheat toast. Meh. I wasn't crazy about the food. The prices were very reasonable though. My toast was way too thick, and was more a multi-grain than a wheat (hey I know the difference). I like thin, crunchy toast, not giant slabs of semi toasted bread. There is no bathroom-you have to go next door to the creepy motel to use the bathroom which is in a room .Did I mention creepy? it's super creepy. Back to the food. I didn't notice any size selections for the juices. I had an orange juice. It was freshly squeezed and very tasty, but oh so tiny. I could have finished it in a gulp. No one read us any specials, though I did hear the people next to us were read the specials (hey maybe I wanted the steak and eggs?! At least gimme the option. hmmph). The service was hurried, but not rude. Our drinks were never refreshed.. so I was licking the pulp out of my cup by my 3rd bite. My husband had the belgian waffle. Again, Meh. Nothing special. There was really nothing special here that would make me come back, the wait alone, though not as long as I expected, will keep me away.

If someone hadn't told us exactly where to find Dick's, we would have never known it was there. We were actually in Northern AZ when some tourists mentioned Dick's hideaway. The exterior doesn't even have a sign! Very dimly lit, so at first, I was hesitant. Tiny, tiny eatery. maybe 3 tables, and seating along there bar (we sat at the bar). It was in the middle of a downpour, so our wait was no more than 5 minutes, but every table was full. I can imagine on a regular weekend, the line is probably out the door...the breakfast was fresh, made right in front of you, and I watched as they sprinkled fresh blueberries on my pancakes. Soooo good. The coffee was great and the bacon was out of this world.  My husband has the carne adovada which he LOVED. Charming and eclectic-definitely going back.

Looks like I am in the minority on this one, but I didn't particularly enjoy the ambiance. We sat on the restaurant/wine side for breakfast. It was really dark.  The service was slow-it seemed like the waitress was the only waitress, and while she was very helpful, she seemed rushed. The AC was freezing. So cold I was shivering which doesn't make me want to eat in a meat locker sort of room. I had the steel cut oatmeal which was just ok. It was a bit on the watery side and too firm. It needed a few more minutes to cook. My apple cinnamon scone was great and the coffee was flavorful.  The cafe side seemed much brighter, much more cheerful. We should have sat there. Also, the bathroom had no changing table-for a place that offers breakfast, and where I saw a few families, it should provide one.

Thank you Groupon for introducing me to another delightful place to eat. Had I not seen this on Groupon, there's no way I would have ever known it was tucked away on this side street. Great Patio..went on saturday night (made reservations) and waited the extra 10 min to sit outside. There was a band playing..what a nice treat! Food was great, as everyone else has raved. We had the empanadas to start-I had the ropa vieja, which was a tad greasier than I had anticipated. It was still good though. Husband has the Pernil (pork), also very good. Good service, and nice ambiance.

my first hike! This was really a fun trail. It was hard for me, but Its my first hike ever so I have no others to compare it to. The trail was paved the entire way, so I had ample opportunities to stop and catch my breath. The views are fantastic..I made it to the top in about 35 min, with about 4 stops. I'm sure if your fit, you can get up there much quicker than me :)

I love massages. I hesitated in going to a massage envy because I didn't want to be bullied into a membership. I was pleasantly surprised that I was no harrassed at all. Clean interior-very friendly and attentive staff. I've gone 3 times now to this location-and have been happy every time. I'm not a fan of huge spas (getting undressed in front of others and walking around in robes), so this works perfectly for me. I like being able to undress in the room and be under the sheets without having to go to a big old holding room. Reminds me of my fave massage place back in NJ. Dim lighting is great in the massage area, and i love the low music. Will definitely keep going back.

We stopped at Osha on a sister's night out to the theater, on our way into Fountain Hills. Very neat and clean. we went on a Saturday night. Service was friendly and the food was fantastic. I had the Pad Thai and we got some really great appetizer which I can't remember the name to, but was super yummy. Our drinks were refreshed and our waitress attentive.  Rest room was clean, no changing tables for kids in case your wondering.

I've been going to a small, inexpensive salon near my house for convenience sake.  I have short hair, which happens to be curly. The last couple of haircuts I haven't been very happy with the shaping of my cut.  I decided to try the Root, since it has so many positive reviews.  I called with fairly short notice, since I'm going on vacation. The guy I spoke to told me there were no openings, but he'd put me on the cancellation list, which was really nice, since I'm not a client yet.   He called me and told me there was an opening later in the week which I jumped on.  My appointment was with Alba-who was really sweet and incredibly thorough. I've gotten so used to my fast haircuts, that I was nervous about WHY it was taking so long. She made her recommendations as to how I should grow out the awkward shape of my hair, and what she would do to make it a more feminine pixie than this awkward bowl I've been sporting.  She also washed my hair after my cut, to get rid of all those stray hairs. Nice touch.  I got a great scalp massage and shine treatment, and I like the extras offered (coffee or tea, as well as cookies)!!  It was busy but not crowded and the price was moderate.  The salon is very modern and chic without feeling stuffy.  I'll need to time my next appointment better so I won't feel the need to rush.

Had dinner here with family. Feels like a real diner!! Reminded me of diners back in NJ. The menu is adorable, on a newspaper! Good selections for kids, big portions. I'd like to go back and see how breakfast is. Simple decor, lots of families and seniors on a Saturday night.

It takes a lot for me to write a negative review. I decided to stop here for a quick Wednesday night dinner. It was busy, but not a friday night busy sort of evening. We opted to sit out on the patio-once we were seated, is where my experience at Half Moon went sour. We sat there for at least 10 min before someone came to take our drink order. Our waitress disappeared, and it took another 15 min for her to reappear with our drinks. I'm annoyed at this point..25 min just to get my drinks and you havn't even taken my order?! In that time..about 3 other tables fill on that patio..those same 3 people get up and walk out because of the lack of service. Our appetizer finally arrive i(we've now been there for 45 min), and I say "I was wondering if we were forgotten", and the food runner then decides to YELL AT ME. Yes, me, the customer. The customer who has been waiting close to an HOUR for a sandwich and a soda. He screams at me, and I quote, "LOOK-the upper floor is packed, and we can cook only so much at a time"...and storms off. What just happened here?! Did that employee seriously yell at me and try to school me on the workings of a restaurant?!  We had been sitting there for so long that by the time we would have left, we would have been stuck waiting elsewhere anyway. I couldnt believe the complete lack of service, courtesy, and the outright  rude employee, who needs a serious training course on customer service. We ate our meal..chuckled at how insane it all was..the 'upper deck' is a 2 step elevated section inside so we had a good laugh at that too. To top off the miserable experience, the food was below mediocre Over cooked, the cole slaw was awful, and we kissed any chance of our drinks being refreshed goodbye. It was like we were the exiles on a deserted island begging for a beverage.  Half Moon will never see my hard earned pennies again. I'd rather run down the street to Sonic!!!!

I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-In's and Dives and had to drive down and see what this little place was all about. We came on July 4th-we had a small wait, no more than at any breakfast place on a weekend. We waited about 10-15 min for a table for 2. We sat on the outdoor patio-it was hot, but they had fans going and it's shaded.. I had the ham and cheese omlette and my husband had the chicken fried steak. Both dishes were great. My omlette was well done, just like I love it (and I didn't even have to request it that way).  My only complaint was the iced coffee I ordered was incredibly weak. It tasted like regular coffee sitting in a puddle of water. Aside from that...friendly service-nice sized portions, and charming atmosphere. We'll be back.

We went to this tea room for a 10 am afternoon tea (kinda sorta high tea).  The hostess was very welcoming and directed us to the box of hats (we were all too eager to try them on).  Fun, feminine decor. Your typical tea room experience. A nice selection of teas, pastries and sandwiches.  We've already booked our next tea!

I really wish this location was closer to my house!  Not only is whole foods chock full of yummy, organic and healthy groceries, but they also have hot food stations throughout the store. How cool is that? Lots of grassfed beef and organic meat/poultry options as well.  I can always find my favorite almond and coconut milk here-and love all green home product selections that aren't easy to find at your regular retailers.  I've tried the sandwiches, japanese and burgers. All tasty.  The prepared food station always has tasty tofu options :)  For you moms out there, there is a changing table in the very TIGHT bathroom-which has a lousy lock on the large stall. We got walked in on at least twice here.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed Red House yet. I go here a few times a month for lunch. Definitely great lunch specials, at great prices, with nice service. Your typical NY/NJ style interior-no frills. You don't come here for ambiance. Good rice, great chicken and broccoli-and they call it Egg Drop soup, not egg flower like so many other places here in AZ. Yay..I like it!

I went to the museum to take some out of town friends. They have children, and honestly, I had no clue what else to do with them. they had a BLAST. What a cute, cute place. It really reminded me of the children's museum in NJ. Very hands on and interactive. The kids had such  a great time.  Loved the little grocery area and pizza baking section. My niece and nephew just love playing kitchen, so they had a blast. Even the gift shop had some really great educational toys.

Now that I have a kiddo of my own, this was a very different experience for me.  Lots of things for a toddler to do and play with. My daughter loves the little mail box corner in one of the rooms, and the toddler play area was really cute.  The noodle forest was well, kind of crazy. Even though it says WALK, there were at least 5 kids running like mad through there. Annoying.  The little cafe is also not great. It's probably a better idea to bring your own snacks. I had the absolute worse hot dog of my life in there.  Besides that..a great place to spend a 110 degree day. The tree at the entrance is pretty spectacular to climb too.

It's hard to find real ice cream in the valley. There are hundreds, if not thousands of frozen yogurt spots, but real ice cream really is rare. After reading some interesting articles on Sweet Republic, we finally decided to drive on down to Scottsdale and check it out. It''s in a strip mall (of course), and the interior is pretty cute. Modern and clean. Plenty of tables to enjoy your ice cream, and a few scattered outside. Their ice creams are made in house, in small batches, with local, all natural ingredients. I had the az mint..you can actually see the mint leaves. It was different, but good.

My favorite Target! Always clean, always well stocked. Ample parking and right in my neighborhood. Love all the green products that Target carries for cleaning.  They have a family restroom and a changing table in the ladies room as well. However, the changing table in the women's rest room is right up against the door, so it's a bit awkward for people walking in to get around you.

I love this place-we found it by using a coupon from one of those saavy shopper mags you get in your mailbox. Great artwork on the walls (they sell them too), wonderful staff, and delish iced coffee. I'm really a dunkin donuts fan from NJ, and when I came out here, I had a horrible time trying to find a decent iced coffee. (sad that there aren't any DD's in my area). This has become my fave new place! I just wish they were open in the evenings. Great sandwiches and they put fruit on the side too!

True Brew is still my absolute favorite coffee place in Phoenix. Rochelle and Sharla  make every single customer feel like a friend. They know us by name and remember our favorite drinks. Delicious breakfast sandwiches with fantastic artwork on the wall. I can't think of a better way to spend my Saturday mornings (ok maybe sleeping but that's another topic). They also have live music on certain nights when weather permits, on their outdoor patio.  They also have a super cute children play group that meets there on Saturday mornings. Such a great place to have in our neighborhood.

I go through a lot of East Coast food withdrawal here. I miss NJ food..big time. There are some things in NJ that are fairly impossible to find here in AZ-so I depend a lot on my friends back home to send me stuff. One of those regional goodies is called Taylor Ham-It's a NJ thing. I can't explain it..it just rocks-the official name is pork roll I believe.  Well, wildflower makes a taylor ham sandwich. I  almost died from the happiness I experienced. I saw it on the menu, and I cheered wondering if it could possibly be my beloved taylor ham from NJ. It is..I dont know why they sell it, or how they found out about it, or what genius decided this would do well, but I am not an avid fanof Wildflower from now on, and hope it never ever leaves the menu.  This location is an ok size-The iced coffee is TERRIBLE. Beyond awful. It had a very artificial after taste. blech! Service was nice..a lot like Paradise Bakery.   Plenty of high chairs for parents but not sure if there are changing tables in the bathroom. I'll have to check that out next time I go in.

I wish I could pick this coffee house up and drop it in my neighborhood. We discovered Hob Nob on a First Friday (we saw it on the ArtLink map of local businesses). There was live music playing, and the staff was super friendly-and helped us pick out some really yummy lemon cake and nut free brownie.  So delicious and my white chocolate mocha was great. The ambiance is unlike anything I've seen in AZ-it had a real, authentic, coffee house setting ( I hate comparing everything to back East, but it's all I got to compare it to people)..but it does feel like a super cool, Montclair NJ sort of joint. (shout out to NJ). Anyway..tons of local art on display and I was amazed at all the seating (inside and out). Loved it! My local place, True Brew is my fave, but this is a perfect spot for a late night treat on a weekend.

Another Groupon find! I am deathly afraid of heights. I'm serious; just climbing on a chair makes me break out into a cold sweat. When I saw this offer on groupon I figured it was a nice to way to face my fears.  It's an indoor facility which is really big! As a first timer, you sit through a 10 min video which shows you the basics of knot tying, and safety stuff, and then off you go. The staff member who initially helped us was super helpful. She saw my terror and was very patient with me-There are plenty of staff members around to help. There is a boulder section too for those who are far less fearful than me. I got a little more than halfway up so not too shabby for a chicken! We went on a saturday afternoon, so it was pretty crowded, but still had plenty of spots to choose from.

We've been here pretty often-I totally forgot to write a review eons ago.  It's a fun place.. menu items right on the wall when you walk in.  Modern decor, simple and to the point.  I love the meat scramble and the brizza-very tasty.  It gets crazy busy on the weekends. We went as a large group on a Sunday-eek, got stuck having to sit outdoors which would be fine, if it weren't August in Phoenix. This can sometimes make me think twice about going-the line can go out the door!!  The seating can be limited when it's busy, so keep that in mind.  Kid friendly with nice kid options too, and they get a little kids packet thing to play with.  Plenty of high chairs!

I am always on the hunt for a good breakfast spot. This is definitely going on the list of regular places to visit. I had an enormous pancake the size of my plate; flavorful with crispy edges..perfect! The waitress informed me that 1 would be enough for me, so I had an egg and 2 slices of bacon. All very good. The coffee was good too, an added bonus :) My husband had the avocado omelette which was also very, very good. Interior of the restaurant wasn't anything exciting...but the food makes up for it. Server was nice and attentive.

Gosh I'm really surprised this place got such lousy reviews! Well, I actually REALLY enjoyed it. We were out and about on friday night looking for a place to eat before buying our Christmas tree. I wanted a burger..really bad, and I didn't want fast food. We remembered seeing Burger Studio when we had breakfast at Scramble, and decided to stop in. I liked the decor-simple, modern and nice clear folding chairs! I liked the butcher block tables. Neat and clean. It was an hour before closing, so it was us, another couple and one other person eating. Basketball was on the tv's (not that I care about sporting events). The counter guy was really friendly-and so was the cook, who greeted us immediately when we walked in. Ketchup bottle was regular size and so was the mustard..so maybe that changed that from previous reviews. Buffalo burgers on the menu which made me think of being back home at a Jersey diner.  My husband had the buffalo which he gave 2 thumbs up to. Juicy meat, and fantastic bun. The lettuce was fresh, and so were the tomatoes. I had a cheeseburger. Also, super deeeelish. I can't complain one ounce. My fries were PERFECTLY salted and not greasy at all. Two huge thumbs up..I'll be back!

Donuts, donuts, lots of donuts!!  My brother in law kept raving about Lamar's, so we ducked in here on a Sunday afternoon. The donuts are HUGE. Now my experience of donuts, is pretty fantastic. I'm a big lover of donuts. My favorite of course, are my east coast tried and true Dunkin Donuts. Not Phoenix dunkin, but NJ DD.  These are pretty similar to the size of DD from back home. I had the chocolate frosted which were very very tasty. They had a nice selection, as well as donut holes and espresso drinks. I had the white chocolate mocha iced-it was good.  Not much for ambiance, but it was fine for picking up a dozen and going on our merry way.  This place is good! Wish they were open later, but it just means I need to crawl out of bed and get there before 2!

I went to a Saturday morning Zumba class at Fat Cat this past weekend. My favorite instructor was subbing at this location. Big dance floor, mirrored and really nice people.  I asked about the schedule and the lady at the desk gave me a copy. Lots of Zumba with plenty of options.

Surfer themed, self service frozen yogurt shop! So happy there is finally frozen yogurt in this area-you pick your size, serve yourself-add your own toppings, and they charge according to ounces. Very friendly staff-we'll definitely go back. Cute decor inside with plenty of seating.

Ambiance! Whenever I am near CityNorth, I sigh sadly and wonder, "what can I do to get people to bring some business to North Phoenix"?! This little gourmet hamburger spot is one of those places that give me hope for CityNorth. Fun menu, and beautiful interior (warm tones..darn brown on gold and love the fab wall paper)! The menu reminds me of delux burger in Phoenix. I had a grilled sirloin burger with a fried egg and bbq sauce (very fun combo); though I didn't ask for cheese, they put cheese on it, so that would be my only complaint. The skinny fries were great :)

I went to US twice, and wanted to wait until my 2nd time to give it a review. We initially went when it first opened it's Greenway location. Since I wasn't happy that time, I chalked it up to opening weekend issues.  Our 2nd try was definitely 100 times better. Super nice service and it was packed..we had about a 10 min wait time on a Sunday morning. Coffee was good and the portions are huge...service was slow, but again, I chalk it up to every single table being occupied. Will definitely go back..the hashbrowns were awesome!

Look no further for real Puerto Rican food in AZ! We've been here just shy of 2 yrs, and as my husband said, it's the best food we've had since leaving the east coast. now we're biased...this food is a total trip home. Real latino food..wonderful prices. I am still flabbergasted at how much I loved loved loved this place! The couple of places out here with caribbean or non-mexican latino food-in my humble opinion, are ridiculously overpriced. It hasn't stopped me from trying new places, but this place is a gem! I had the bistec encebollado with white rice and RED beans..RED BEANS!!!Here, in AZ, red beans!!!! yeeaaahhh!!! My husband had the pernil with arroz con gandules, which made us feel like we were back in NJ all over again. If you're looking for a fancy dining room..forget it! A few tables in this simple but very homey little mom & pop joint. The tostones are just like my family makes them..so I cleaned my plate..I left no crumb, no morsel on my plate. AND on top of the fantastic food, there was some great salsa music playing on the little stereo system, which honestly I havn't heard since we boarded flight out west. Do no radio stations in Phoenix play Salsa?! Anyway..get your little behinds into el coquito...it's THE best in Puerto Rican food in the state. It's definitely our new favorite place!

I have passed the Rustic Cafe quite a few times, never knowing this was a sit down, dine in spot. My sister suggested it on a friday night, so we ended up going on before a movie. Really cute decor-and really good food. We shared some bruschetta, and all had sandwiches. My fish sandwich was fantastic-though my husband felt his spicy wrap, was not spicy at all. Definitely will go back and try breakfast.

This is definitely a weekend full of new favorite places for me. Revo Burrito definitely topped my expectations. I saw it when we were leaving Delux the day before. The interior is amazing...loved the decor-from the eco friendly bathrooms to the sinks.  I ordered the chicken fajita bowl, with brown rice-It's safe to say this is my favorite restaurant brown rice to date-it's flavored with lime and cilantro. Perfect!! Loved the presentation, and I had the sugar free lemonade. Service was polite and quick, and we had a nice night sitting outdoors at the several tables they have. It's open late, which  is great-we have such a hard time finding decent late night dining. We'll be back!

I have a hard time finding free time for things like pedicures and other personal grooming. I discovered this 20 Lounge near my job takes appointments online. Awesome!!! It's the little things like that which sway me. I have a busy schedule, so if I can squeeze in a pedi, with an appointment that I can make without calling, it's a huge winner for me.  Pretty nail salon-oversized chairs and you put your tootsies in a bowl, not a massage chair. It's different than your standard nail places..a higher end look and feel. Not better, just different. I got a great nail technician ( I think her name was Desiree). Nice massage though brief, and I added the sugar scrub and hot towel service (those little things are extra $ here).  It was me and one other person (who was talking way too loud-there's one at every nail place right)?!  Music and videos are playing on the screens and they offered me something to drink.  A little more $$ than I like to spend, but it's great when I'm at work and can't get to my neighborhood salon.

I have a terrible feeling they've closed.  This is the best chinese food we've had in the 9 years we've lived here; they even have mei fun!   The phone just rings...we always get delivery-would love if someone knows if it's still open.

Love their soups, love their salads. The sandwiches are a little strange for me, so I don't really enjoy those. This is right in our neighborhood, so we go here..A LOT. Breakfast is good, and that menu changes every so often too. Ample seating, clean and friendly service. Get the frequent customer card-you rack up points for free meals, muffins and coffee.  Also for you moms out there, there's a changing table in the restroom that is in the big stall and there is plenty of room to maneuver a stroller in here.  Hooray!

I had the pleasure of going to MIM this weekend-we heard a commercial for the hip hop display and thought that was reason enough to go. A very cool exhibit with performers in the museum, as well as an amazing American Sabor exhibit on latino music. The museum is set up by continents, with a great audio tour that starts automatically at each country.  A must see for music lovers

I learned about Amy K Music from a groupon offer. I started taking violin lessons after a 15 yr break. I couldn't be happier-my instructor Laura is incredibly patient and full of great feedback. My childhood teacher was a stuffy lady stuck in the stone ages, so it's refreshing to take lessons from a person in my age group. I have nothing to compare the pricing to since my lessons as a kid were in public school in NJ (and were free). They are certainly are flexible with time and scheduling. The office space is a tad, creepy is about the most negative thing I can say. the place needs some paint and some cheering up. All in all very happy with my lessons.

CHICKEN FRANCESE. They have it. I can't believe it. 3 yrs hunting for chicken francese in Phoenix, and we find it in this tiny little pizzeria! A definite real pizzeria feel..simple presentation, gruff service, good food. What more do we need?! Generous portions and great prices. I didn't try the pizza but the chicken francese I had was great along with penne and vodka sauce my husband had were flavorful. The garlic knots were super too.

This is another welcome addition to Bell Town Center, which has been adding some great new businesses in the past few months. I had the little bacon burger which was perfect. Super crispy bacon. My husband had the Cheeseburger.double patties. He enjoyed it. I loved the fries..if you are a crispy skinny fry kind of person, than forget coming here. They were thick, and a bit on the soggy side, which is just how I love them. They have mello yello as a fountain drink option. Mello yello! take me back to 1986! It was pricey..burgers, 1 medium drink, 1 large fry-$18 and change.  the atmosphere was fun, and I didn't see the peanuts until we left, darn! We'll be back.

This has to be one of the funniest named restaurants ever.  Besides that, meh. I was confused by the decor. They left it the way the previous restaurant had it, so it's modern, and then picnic tablecloths on the tables?? The food was ok-I had the half chicken. Nothing terribly exciting but good. You get this huge chunk of corn bread (with real corn kernels visible), which was good too. We waited a good 20 minutes before our food came out; not sure if that's standard wait time for a BBQ place. it was ok-don't know if I'd go back.

Our shower in our master bathroom had a terrible clog. I tried all the natural stuff to get it unclogged with no luck, as well as pouring drano and all that other crap to try and get it going. I found Option One right here on Yelp. It mostly positive views, and i liked the one price, no hassle option. The service was fantastic-the guy who came was super helpful, friendly to my husband and also gave us tips on how to change out a faucet in another room. Didn't try to get us to do anything else....can't get any better than that. That one price option is absolutely true. 49.50-NO hidden fees. Hooray!!

Large, spacious coffee shop with live music on Fridays. Lots of tasty pastries to choose from and I really love their italian sodas.  Great seating area and they carry a lot of milk alternatives (hooray, both almond and coconut milk)!  Sat and chatted with friends for hours on a Friday night..never felt rushed and the music was great too.  Had a white chocolate mocha with coconut milk;very, very good!

A friend invited  us to try Jump Street with our toddler. There wasn't much for her to do there for her age group, but there were a couple of coin operated ride on toys. We did some bouncing and hopefully next time she'll feel a little braver and try the bounce house. There were lots of things for older kids to do. I agree with another reviewer..there are some signs of wear and tear, but overall, a good time for a decent price. Bathrooms were clean.

I had brunch here on a Sunday morning; it was fairly crowded and loud, which was fine by me. We opted to sit indoors since there was a 20 minute wait for the patio seating. Plenty of high chairs available, and we were asked to park our stroller in the front of the restaurant. We were seated in what felt like the kids corner-which suited us..our daughter was having a ball smiling at another kid in front of us. The menu was interesting-lots of drinks available.  I loved that they had almond milk available for my coffee. hooray! I had the blueberry muffin with almonds-it was amazingly good, and I had the tofu scramble with chorizo. Waaaayyyyy tooo spicy for me, so unfortunately, I can't give that a good review. It gave me horrible indigestion for hours and hours. I'd definitely go back and try something else.  The menu was inventive and choices colorful-though not a lot of variety.   NO idea if there was a changing table in the rest room. It was completely occupied when I went in, so I opted for the public restroom across the way (right next to the escalator).

I've been to the Grimaldi's in Old Town, which is also really good. We stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon; I was in a bit of a rush-I had a spa appointment, so we really didn't have the time to sit and wait a long time. We sat outside with our daughter-the patio is nice. It's on a corner, so you have some mountain views. The service was very slow-I don't know that it's a negative here. It's great for chatting, and just hanging out, which seems like all the groups on the patio had the time to do. I was in kind of a rush, so..ugh, I wish it had been a tad faster. Food was great..we had a small half chicken and half regular pizza. It was really good and large enough for the 3 of us to share. We'll definitely go back when we have more time to relax and enjoy the ambiance.

I tried Floo-id this past weekend during their 5 year anniversary event.  I take a weekly class with one of their instructors, Lauren (she's amazing by the way).  This was the first time I'd ever taken a yoga class at an actual studio.  The staff was super friendly and gave me a quick run down of what to expect of a hot yoga class.I stayed close to the door in case it got too intense for me. It was hot,and I really enjoyed it!! I Crossfit and have some shoulder mobility issues, and found that yoga is a really great compliment to my fitness schedule.   The bathrooms have showers, lockers and cubbies to store your stuff. A really great place.  Lauren is always great at helping with form too.  A very warm welcome by everyone-great experience.  Definitely give Floo-id a try!

Real ice cream!! It's been really hard for me to find real ice cream here (not like back east where we have real ice cream all over the darn place). A friend recommended churn and it didn't disappoint. I had a scoop of double chocolate and a scoop of mint ice cream with thin mints on a sugar cone..GLORIOUS!!!  My husband had the ice cream sandwich, which is 2 giant cookies you pick, and they slather the ice cream inside. It's amazing!   The entrance is rather narrow so we had to wait outside, but there is a really nice back patio and a seating area it shares with the restaurant next door.  Loved it..we'll definitely be back.

What a great concept!! I was able to make and confirm my appointment right on their website..so handy and convenient. I tend to be angry every year around the time of my company xmas party; I tend to just want a style, without having to wait eons at my salon. I decided to give Drybar a try. I went with the Cosmo-not disappointed. My wait was a bit long..the hostess explained Saturdays are definitely their busy day-to give them a try on a weekday for a less harried experience. I was given a wonderful scalp massage while I waited, and my stylist was super friendly. Love the beverage service, and there are even Ipod docks at each station if you wanted to use that. The space is so feminine without going overboard on the decor. There was also a nice little tray of goodies at the counter, which is a nice touch.

I'm really lazy; It's not that I don't want to work out-it's just that I have to "work" at working out that is the problem..anyway..my husband looked into this whole crossfit thing and decided to try it. He loves it..breathes it..and I decided to give it a go. I can't say I'm loving it because as I said, I'm lazy..but this is probably exactly what I need. A detailed program that will give me results. My husband looks amazing and feels great (not that he didn't already). Jared is a great motivator and the new location is great for us. Crossfit is going to whip my lazy butt into shape!

We went to a birthday party here just this past weekend. There's a lot to like about this place; it's small and there was only 1 party going on during the time we were there. Our friends had a LOT of kids there-so I can't imagine during open play, how crowded this place must get. Like other reviewers have said, it's small, so it's fairly limited. My toddler rode on the couple of coin operated cars and we hung out in the toddler section. That had some balls, pads to crawl on, a mini jump section, and some other toys. I like that they had high chairs during food time. Staff was friendly and attentive. Bathroom was spotless!! There is a changing table, and when I told the attendant there was no bag in the diaper bin, she promptly put one in. Cute place!

NO frills. That's what you will find here. This isn't exactly a pretty neighborhood, so when my sister mentioned trying them for breakfast with the kids I didn't exactly jump for joy. We gave it a shot anyway...very pleasantly surprised. Really great service..we had 2 little ones, and our waitress was so kind and patient. The interior of the restaurant is plain; whatever was here before, was left exactly that way. Some 80's seating...benches and plain table tops, plain walls.  Our food was pretty fantastic. I had a bacon and cheese omlette with country potatoes that was just perfect. My coffee cup was never empty. Coffee is poured throughout breakfast. I don't know about you all, but there is nothing more annoying than going to breakfast, and getting to the bottom of your mug, and no one ever refills. This was great (and a reminder of diner service in NJ)  Big fluffy biscuits and the kids menu is fantastic and reasonable..and they gave us coupons to come back. We went on a Saturday morning and we had about a 5 minute wait..the place was filled with seniors and families. Perfect!!!

I'm allergic to waxing on my face-after one awful experience in Las Vegas, I'll never let wax touch my face, ever ever again. I started threading in NYC; the salons are everywhere. I continued in NJ, and once we moved out to AZ, I had a hard time finding a spot initially. Each of the major malls has threading now, which is FANTASTIC, though wish they all had more staff. This location is pretty great-right on the 2nd floor, it's a permanent kiosk. I wish it was a more private location which is why it's not getting 5 stars; it can be a little weird just getting plucked with the whole mall to see, but once you get over that, its' really great. I haven't had a bad experience at this location ever. I went on Saturday, and waited 5 minutes-they had 3 girls working which was great. I always have my upper lip and brows done.  Yes, it's painful, but if you have wax sensitivity, this really is the way to go. For those wondering what the after threading effects are, I get swollen and red for about 30 min then it goes away. NO throbbing or sensitivity.  I'll always always thread!!

My lousy experience with this Jimmy John's started with an overcharge on my debit card. I ordered 1 sandwich and 1 bag of chips for a delivery. The delivery was fast and the food was good, so lets get that out there to be fair. I added an extra star because the food here has always been fine.  I logged into my bank account like I normally do, and there was a $19 charge from Jimmy's. That's one expensive sandwich. I called three times. Spoke to "managers" 3 times. My information was taken, and all 3 times, my call was never returned. I went there in person; Once again, my information taken, no call returned. There was a general "I have no idea how to handle this, I'm going to call my boss/area manager" and then nothing. This is really poor customer service. My call should have been returned the first day-a courtesy "I am handling it, I will get your card refunded asap, apologies, etc.   Over charging a customer is a big deal. I gave the tip in cash, so I know that I did not key in a wrong amount when I placed my order online.  This was their mistake, and no effort was made on behalf of the management to help me. They've lost my business.

I'm so excited that there is something other than Mexican food on this side of town! The interior is bright and modern-with a super friendly staff. There was live music on a Saturday night, which was really fantastic. The restaurant was packed, which made for very slow service..but we were fine with waiting. I had an Inca cola, which is one of my absolute favorite south american sodas. I had the Pollo Saltado...a chicken and fries dish with rice..fantastically seasoned. My husband had the arroz tapado,which was rice, then a layer of steak, and another layer of rice. He wasn't as excited..he felt the slices of steak were very small, which left him wanting more flavor. We munched on a corn kernel appetizer which escapes my memory, but it was roasted and salted..very tasty. The hostess and owners checked on everyone's tables, which is a nice touch also. Definitely a place to return to!

After finding this on the Yelp "just reviewed" section, I decided to give The Strand a try. We went on a Thursday night, and met some friends, who have 2 small children. It was fairly empty, and far more casual than I had imagined. That's not a bad thing by the way. Cute decor!!! I had the chicken parm with penne pasta which was good..my husband had the chicken parm pizza, which he also enjoyed. Our friend sent back the chicken for her dish..she felt it was slightly pink...and they fixed the issue asap. Nice service and dessert was pretty good too. We had the cookie with ice cream combo. I'm sure on game nights this spot will be jumping. OH, and they validate parking for the garage..very handy.

Lots of seating inside and out. There is a nice low padded seating area all along the windows. IT's very busy, so if you're looking for a fast chipotle, this might not be the one to stop into. We sat outside since it's at Cityscape, and people watched fora  while. Food was good, service was good.

This location is pretty new to North Phoenix. I love it..simply because it has the cleanest bathroom I've ever laid eyes upon. Seriously, super clean, and the nicest changing table ever. Did I say ever? EVER!!!

Massive. My husband described as a walmart version grocery store. They have some really good deals if you take the time to walk the store, and use the coupons (which are usually pretty good). The produce prices are fantastic and so is the dry goods, scoop your own area. 2.98 for raw almonds??! A steal! It's open 24 hrs, though this area is a bit sketchy at night. I don't think I'd go there late in the evening.Just something to keep in mind. I don't know how well lit the parking area is, so take my opinion on that with a grain of salt. I went on a weekend, and there was no line at the register I chose, though it was very crowded. They also accept manufacturer coupons, which is nice! Someone reviewed they don't accept cards? Not the case when I went..maybe that was a temporary glitch.  I don't know that I can go there often; I get that costco anxiety. Do I really want to walk a mile for a gallon of milk and eggs? Also, I don't see that they have many natural or organic options (no organic eggs/etc). Just some "food" for thought!

This location is a combo Toys R us/Babies R Us. The left-hand side of the store is the Babies R Us. This opened I believe early in the spring of 2012. We registered here for our baby shower but found it was lacking a bit in selection, so we were able to finish up at the larger Mayo Blvd location. This babies R us doesn't have the little gift wrap section where you can choose their complimentary wrap by the way. Toys R us side is great..nice selection, neat and tidy.   For the moms, there is a changing table in the womens rest room, as well as a nice mothers nursing room with a sofa and changing table, stocked with wipes and disposable covers. Hooray!

Stopped in here on a Saturday when I had used a spa gc at a different place. I couldn't get them to add a manicure so I walked over to the Nail Room. Clean and fast.  I waited less than 5 minutes and the price was reasonable.

we went to this theater as part of a Smart Shopper Deal. It was a VIP room which includes popcorn and a drink for 6 people. Awesome deal..it's just pretty far from my house-a really nice treat fora  weekend. Beautiful theater!!! The VIP room is a sort of sky box-2 levels that have couches and chairs, your own bathroom (sweet)!!, and waiter service. We had sliders, pizza, and onion rings as well (typical theater food quality).

I had the morning of my birthday off, so we ended up driving here to check it out. It was very busy for a Wednesday morning. We sat outside on the patio which was really nice. I had the pancakes of the day, which were buttermilk pancakes stuffed with strawberries. So good! Service was great, though slow, which I understand from how busy it was. I can't imagine how long the weekend waits can get here. Food was fresh, coffee was good, and I loved the mug size. Our little one had pancakes with a nice sized chocolate milk that was really good. She had some crayons and a coloring thing they gave her to keep her occupied which was nice.  For you moms, yes there is a changing table in the large bathroom stall.

No frills, Just burgers. Small menu but very good. I had a burger with regular fries. Tasty and well cooked. Bathroom has a changing table, which dangles over the toilet..that can be weird. I'm left handed, so my daughter's head is over the toilet. Super weird. Besides that..very clean, friendly service. Moderately priced.

Pretty patio-and nice service. I had an iced toddy..very good. My only complaint is that the large portion is actually a pretty small cup-felt like a 16 oz but it might have been a 20 oz. Besides that-I'd return.

I did a general search on Yelp and decided to give this place a try since it had such great reviews. Another plus, at the time I looked up my review, there was a Yelp offer on this location, so even better, I used my $10 off deal, which is still far below what a lot of competitors are charging. I had my iPad 2's screen replaced in under an hour.  The guy was super friendly and really nice!! Forget Apple and their refusal to replace the glass-this is the way to go. Looks and works perfectly!

What a great coffee shop!! They sell toddy which is a nice method of brewing iced coffee. The interior is very spacious and has a kids play corner that my daughter loved.  When your a parent trying to sit down for coffee, it's really great to have a distraction for the kiddos. The breakfast menu is very small, burrito, panini, and some muffins. For parents needing that changing table, they have them here (hooray)!

Great pricing...beats the mall booths, hands down. Usually only 1 person working which is why I can't give it five stars right now. Spacious waiting area and the 2 girls who have worked on my brows were careful to not leave my brows too thin and listened to my instructions on shape. My new brow spot for sure.

I went to El Chullo on a Friday night with two other people. We were seated immediately but it was very busy ( a great sign)!  The food was great-I had arroz chaufa con pollo, which is a sort of chinese rice with chicken, and my sister and friend both had  the lomo saltado.  The dining room is very small; just something to keep in my mind.  Very friendly service,great food, and a great latin vibe.

I'm so glad this opened in our neighborhood! It's in the Goodwill shopping center at 7th St. & Union Hills. We would have completely missed it had we not realized the new "open" neon sign. It's very big inside..very deceiving from the outside. Nice choices on the menu too..it's not just a pizza place..pasta, breakfast, and plenty of seating. Nice interior with a lot of seating.

I spent a couple of hours with my three year old on a weekday. The Owner was very friendly and extended the Groupon price even though we didn't know there was one available.  The interior is simply laid out-some individual rooms that have themes-a kitchen, vet room, tool room, grocery area. Nothing fancy-a lot of Melissa and Doug toys which are favorites of my daughter. She had a great time.  Some of the toys are a little worn or without batteries (probably to reduce threw noise)!  There are chairs and couches for adults and a kitchen area to have your own snacks or there are a handful on sale.  The largest room are mostly toddler ride ons.  It was fine for an hour or two out of the house.  We will be back-my daughter loved the kitchen and vet play sets.

We tried BoSa during their opening weekend. The donuts were really great..big, fluffy and fresh! The interior of the shop is no frills-plenty of donut varieties to choose from in the cases. The drink case was fully stocked with a big selection which is also nice. There was no line since we went fairly late in the evening and the staff was friendly. Donuts were very fresh, even though it was late! We'll try their breakfast sandwiches on another visit. We're happy this is in our neighborhood..seems like we'll be coming here often.

This place is great for group/family outings. We sat outside on the patio with a large group; the misters and fans really helped with keeping it comfortable on an August evening. There were a ton of kids there on a Saturday night and a ton of dogs.  Love the vibe and decor!  Soooo, this is where you lose me a bit because..well....a dog sitting on the patio chairs, with their paws and bodies on the tables where people eat? um, EWWW. Look, I love animals..but I need some boundaries. I don't want dog slobber or hair in my food or on my clothes.  I didn't see one dog in the designated dog area, but I saw a ton of dogs on and around tables and chairs. It was just. gross. I love dogs...really I do!  Anyway-my food was ok. I'm not a fan of sweet bread, and the bun on my turkey burger was sweet (maybe a potato bun)? Fries were over salted. I ended up taking the bun off and trying wrap my burger with the ton of greens that were on the burger (no easy task).  Our server, Tasha, was awesome!! Kept our drinks coming and our waters filled-and was super friendly.

Who doesn't love doughnuts?!  This space at Norterra has bounced from business to business and I'm happy to see Fractured Prune has arrived. They have so many fun combinations to try and it's so close to our area. Score!!

We were there on opening weekend and the line was long but not terrible.  I had the red velvet cookies with mint ice cream-oh my goodness....So good!  The seating is tight..it was a full dining area and we had to squeeze in to sit but it was doable.  I had mine hot pressed which was just lovely and a must-how else can you eat it?!  If you are as tired of fro yo as I am,this is a must.
