Great place to stop for Gelato while walking through The Venetian.  They recommended Pistachio and I enjoyed it.  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11

Best burger I've ever had.  Don't let the location fool you.  This is not a "mall" place.  Once you get past that and into the fun ambiance inside, you will see how great Burger Bar is!  I could not decide on the personalized burgers, so I had the Hubert Keller Burger: buffalo meat, carmelized onions, blue cheese & spinach on ciabatta.  It was excellent!  Next time I will need to study the menu beforehand!  My boyfriend loved his burger and raved about it to our friends the next day-- not something he normally does.  I had a bite of his and the jalapeno bacon is awesome!  We arrived around 9:30 and it wasn't too busy, so we just waited about 15 minutes.  The service was excellent.  Our water was right on top of things and we had other servers checking in as well.  Probably some of the best service I've had in a casual restaurant!  Oh yeah, there is a HUGE bar with a zillion beers on tap (I'm not a beer drinker) and hard alcohol too.  Next time I definitely will try a fried egg on my burger!!!

STILL AWESOME!!!  We had a 20 minute wait on a Saturday night at 7pm... but we figured that into our plan, so it wasn't a big deal.  They have a huge menu and the Huber Keller Burger is amazing, but didn't really need the extra fried egg on top.  I like that they have an open kitchen... no one can spit in your food!  I noticed the long bar would be a good place for dining solo.  Only drawback is that it's a trek to the bathroom... but awesome food and a great time with our friends in the booth.  We liked trying all he different varieties of fries... my favorites were the sweet potato & zucchini fries.  I will be back to Burger Bar every time I go to Vegas!  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11

Stayed here for a long weekend in October and had a great time.  We were staying with a group of friends, so I was happy with their choice of MB as our hotel.  It's nice without being over the top, the decor is tasteful and it doesn't smell bad!  I'm not a gambler, but did have fun playing at the $15 blackjack tables.  I was more interested in their POOL and have separate reviews for those (Mandalay Bay Beach & Moorea Beach Club).  Yes, MB is at the end of the Strip... but it's convenient that you can walk to Luxor and take the tram to Excalibur to make your way down the strip.  The rooms are much bigger than most hotel rooms.  Our bathroom had dual sinks and a full size tub separate from the shower.  Be careful with the mini bar since it's weight monitored = take something out & you might get charged for it!  I liked our pool view and it was a great way to wake up.  They have multiple Elevator Bays for levels 2-16, 17-34, etc.  Be sure to push the door close button in elevators to save some time.  Door key cards are magnetic, so be careful with your magnetic closures on wallets & purses.  I forgot that my "travel" purse has a magnetic closure and had to get a new door card after mine stopped working.  Crazy long lines at Starbucks, so check out the Orchid Lounge for your morning coffee fix.  Also my favorite (non-fancy) restaurant in Vegas is Burger Bar at Mandalay Place.  You have to check it out.  All in all, I was happy with my stay and I would definitely stay at MB again!  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11

Came here for dinner on a Friday night before we saw Steel Panther in their venue space.  It's not a place that I would have chose, but this was a group situation.  We had a side room for our group of 12+ and the service was okay, not great.  Being in any side room, it's hard to flag down your waiter or waitress if you need something.  My main complaint is that I ordered the Yummy Chicken and it wasn't yummy.  :-(  It was really spicy and that wasn't in the menu description.  I probably should have ordered a burger or sandwich, but I wanted an entree for dinner.  i would have sent it back if I wasn't with a big group.  I just didn't want to make a big deal of it, so my man shared some of his food with me which was just okay.  I'm sad to see that it's Chef Aaron Sanchez running this restaurant because I like him on TV.  STEEL PANTHER:  Fun overall, but we didn't like the opening band that night at all.  The opener took way too long and I didn't know that Steel Panther's actual show would be so looooong.  Our group of friends at the show (maybe 10 of us?), only 4 of us made it to the end of the show.  I know, we're getting old (in our 30s)... but the show was kind of dragged out.  The venue was good, but the drinks were expensive.  I don't think I would want to see another show here.  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11

Awesome Adults-Only TOPLESS Pool!  They call it TOPTIONAL.  :-)  The cover charge varies by the day and time of year... this particular day it was free for ladies who said "toptional" and guys were $25?  We negotiated and got a bed for our group and included the guys' cover.  It's like a restaurant where you get seated and pay extra for beds or a cabana.  We were lucky enough to be invited up to one of the private cabanas and party with some cool people up there.  They had free alcohol and food, so it was a great time!    It was about 50/50 girls/guys and not many of the girls were topless on this particular day.  I can understand why they were nervous because it does seem like everyone stares.  There were about 8 girls I saw topless, most in passing... All were on the smaller side and natural breasts (surprising!).  This is one of those things that really depend on the day you go since it's not a strip club!  Complaining about the lack of pictures on Yelp?  I'm shocked there are so many!  That's because there are NO PICTURES at Moorea Beach Club since it is now topless.  Ladies, don't be worried about showing your girls!  The security guards were on top of it anytime someone got out a camera or was trying to take cell phone pictures.  There are signs everywhere too...  It's a really fun pool with adults having fun!

3.5 stars = Brunch on 8-11-13   Terrace Point Cafe is a gorgeous spot to brunch outside or in with views of the pool. There were a group of "fancy" women at the table next to us who could not stop complaining about the tiny little birds. Ummm, you're outside. Birds live outside. What do you expect? They were just looking for something to complain about.  It was a warm day in Vegas, but that wasn't a problem. The umbrellas have misters built in, so on those especially hot days, you can stay cool (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tANhxxLlzOrvzdXnO1c4cw&userid=7lsk7VJ4OvaTxtdcNeSjZg)   FOOD: I'm a fan of Eggs Benedict,so I ordered the Benedict Trio (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4frRHBqrT68dh0TvpieKSQ&userid=7lsk7VJ4OvaTxtdcNeSjZg). It was very good and not too much food. I would order it again for sure. The prices were a bit high, but it's Vegas. Didn't seem too over the top to me.  SERVICE: Decent but it needed some improvement. There were a few times that I needed my coffee or water refilled and it took awhile. In fact, it took awhile to get my coffee in the first place, so I need to dock another half star.  Would I come back here? Definitely. It's a chill spot to have a relaxing brunch. Great people watching with the pool right there and the little birds trying to scavenge any crumb that might fall. Just make sure they bring my coffee next time!

I've been here on two separate trips and enjoyed it both times.  It seems kind of pricey, but I would rather pay $3-4 more to be able to sit down and have someone serve me.  I don't like buffets and get tired of having quick "food court" style meals.  Both times I got the Eggs Benedict, which is small for $15 but nice that it's not too much food.  I love that their coffee is served as a whole pot on each table and it has good cream-- none of those little cups to fiddle with! The ambiance is similar to a corporate office and it's big room that can get loud.  I didn't really notice much since I was with friends and we were having good conversation.  They have large round tables for big groups and smaller comfortable booths for 4-5 people.  I would definitely go here again.  It's a bit on the expensive side, but I love a nice (but not too fancy) breakfast!

Studio Cafe... What happened?  I've been here a few times before and always had a great experience. Now I see where the subpar reviews are coming from. On my last visit in January 2013 (and yes, it will be my LAST visit), the place wasn't very busy. Took awhile to get my coffee and take my order, but I let that go. When my husband's food arrived, his potatoes were cold. Mine were also cold, so we sent them both back. (And I'm not a "send things back" kinda person). My 2nd plate of Eggs Benedict had cold potatoes and the eggs were over cooked (not runny at all). We talked to the waiter and the manager... Our meal ended up being comped, but it was an awful experience that literally left a bad taste in my mouth.  So sad... Guess I will have to find a new place in Vegas for a good sit-down breakfast.

Great experience here tonight! Located in Forum Shops in Caesars Palace, this place seemed a bit quiet compared to the CF at home in San Diego.   We ordered all appetizers: Avocado Eggs Rolls (my favorite--always amazing), Tex-Mex Egg Rolls, roasted artichoke, fried chicken sliders and a  combo of fried avocado, zucchini & portobello mushrooms. Great service from Scott. Food was awesome & we had great cocktails too.

No complaints about Olive & Ivy!  Free underground parking.  It looked like they have items to purchase for takeout in addition to the restaurant and bar.  There was a bit of a wait to be seated for Sunday brunch, but they have pagers and we were able to wait at the bar.  Waiting is always better when there are cocktails involved!  When we were seated, we got bread made in house & served with amazing fresh pesto. You must try it.  (see pic:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=_G2ZOQRe-pVGpNNKajnqCw)  White sangria was yummy, but didn't have any fresh fruit & was served in a low ball glass (see pic:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=Zwif3G0eX8d5LHGae_HA9w). Bellini was very good and very strong!  I had a good buzz after 2 drinks.  Eggs Benedict was very good with fresh shaved ham & a little fresh basil in the hollandaise. I would've liked a bit more hollandaise (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=RybLwKuSPLit5o2PPxy1aw).  My man's Breakfast sandwich was very good. The home fries were perfectly crispy in the outside & soft on the inside. (see pic:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=YveKHBF94smnOuN-utOxOg)  Patio seating with waterfront view is quaint and has a European feeling with the umbrellas, stone fountains & geraniums in the tree planter boxes. All in all... A wonderful brunch experience. I would DEFINITELY come back the next time I'm in Scottsdale.

A great spot in the middle of Mandalay to chill.  Coffee bar hours 5am-2pm.  They also have sandwiches, pastries, etc. The employees were very nice and I got quick service.  I liked my coffee there and loved that it was so convenient.  It's a nice spot that you can be in the middle of the action, but with it being elevated and having all the columns around it makes the Orchid Lounge a private spot to get a coffee and have some nice casino people watching.  Small & Large coffee sizes comparable to Tall & Grande, so if you want Venti take a walk across the casino to Starbucks... but pay more.  Why?  The Orchid Lounge is a great coffee bar.  :-)  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11

$10 for elevator to top.  It was fun and something to do once in Vegas, but I don't feel the need to go again.  Unfortunately I was there with a girlfriend and it was a very windy day.  The tower had been closed and reopened already that day.  I was in a sundress, so it was freezing cold up there with all the wind going.  I got some great pictures and enjoyed the view.  I recommend it if you're cruising the strip and want to "do" something!  It would be lots of fun if you coordinated your trip to the top with the Bellagio Fountains show!

Another fun thing at the Bellagio (after the Fountains) that is beautiful, fun and FREE!  Each display varies by season.  I liked the one I saw in June 2009 better than end of March 2010.  An employee informed me that the garden peaks at certain times (a few weeks after I was there -- the tulip bulbs had just been planted) and that makes sense.  The gorgeous floral displays remind me of the Rose Parade in Los Angeles on New Year's day.  I've grown up watching it every year, so it's fun to see something similar in Vegas.  I bring my camera and take lots of pictures.  It's quite relaxing if it's not too crowded.  CHECK IT OUT!

This is the MAIN pool with the beach... the adults only is called "Moorea Beach Club" and located in a private upper area.  We came here on a Saturday afternoon in October-- probably the last weekend that the pool is open.  I was here just to relax, read & drink in the sand... and check out the waves!  We got pretty good service for drinks. $14 for a Miami Vice (Strawberry Daiquiri mixed with Piña Colada). I thought about checking out the Lazy River but didn't want to pay to rent a raft or deal with masses of kids.  The Wave Pool was super fun and similar to the actual ocean.  You have to be ready for the waves to come and it's good that their lifeguards patrol the line!  I would come back here again for the wave pool, but don't really like dealing with crowds... so checking out the adults only Moorea Beach Club might be a better bet if you have some $$$ and a fun group of friends!

Wow... Loved it!   We stayed here just 1 night for a quick weekend getaway and had a great experience. The Tower King Suite on the 56th floor was very spacious large suite with lots of mirrors so it felt even bigger.   http://www.wynnlasvegas.com/Rooms/EncoreTowerSuites/TowerKingSuite We loved the super comfy bed and tons of pillows. The couch/chaise in the suite was comfy and the automated curtains were gorgeous. The bathroom was very nice with great linens (super soft!), nice robes to use, adjustable pressure on the shower, dual sinks, a lighted makeup mirror and everything you would expect from a luxury hotel. I didn't get to try the tub, but hopefully next time. We had a pool view to the Wynn and it was really nice. While checking in, the desk clerk warned us about the bass sound from the clubs at night and offered to put us on the other side of the tower if we wanted. I didn't think the bass was too bad since my husband & I are both heavy sleepers, but if you are a light sleeper you might want to request the opposite side of the tower. No indulging in the mini bar-- there are lots of notes saying that anything you pick up for more than 60 seconds will be charged to the room. We took advantage of late checkout at 1pm.   The rooms also had a Do Not Disturb button you could turn on so that the maid service won't disturb your room. Love the free Wifi-- why don't all hotels have this? In staying on the 56th floor, the elevators were great except the fact that my ears popped every time we went up or down? WTF? I would then spend a few minutes opening my mouth & dropping my jaw to make the popping stop and then looked like a moron I'm sure. Oh well!  The decor of the hotel was classy overall. Lots of red with flowers and butterflies in jewel tones. The red and purple is really nice together and there was some great art throughout the whole property.   Blackjack table was fun and the cocktail waitresses had nice uniforms, especially compared to some of the other hotels. It was really funny to see a 5+ month pregnant belly of one of the cocktail waitresses and she was still in the same little dress as the other ones!  POOL: Pretty mellow at the main pool on the Sunday we were there. It was probably because Lil John was at the Encore Beach Club that day. After determining it would cost $97 just for my husband and I to get in, we determined that we didn't want to spend that much. We wandered over to the European Pool and it's "21 and over -- No Cameras" sign. I didn't realize that meant topless... Ha! It wasn't *that* private, so only a few ladies were actually topless. The "toptional" pool at the Mandalay Bay has more security out making sure that no one is taking pictures of the topless ladies. The cocktail waitress we had was a bit slow, so we only ended up having one cocktail each. My favorite poolside drink is a Lava Flow-- strawberry daiquiri mixed with a piña colada. YUMMY! It was a good time, but I wouldn't head to Encore just for their pool.  The hotel is immaculate and such a great luxurious experience. Hopefully my husband will treat me to it again!

Kind of difficult to find, but my friend and I were looking for a place to have mid-afternoon coffee.  This place was further into the casino and near the other shops.  I probably wouldn't have noticed it otherwise... thanks Yelp for leading the way!  I got a latte and Dulce de Leche croissant (see photo), which was excellent!  I've never had a soft fluffy croissant with yummy caramel in the middle. Had it been later in the day, I totally would have gone for one of their alcoholic coffees since they sounded excellent!  I thought their prices were normal for Vegas, not cheap but a decent value compared to other expensive places.  Next time I want to come for the pastries and the dessert.  See photos for how cute the Tiramisu cup is!  The space is small ((I wouldn't go with more than 4 people)) with nice ambiance and soft Italian music.  The windows have an obstructed view of pool and give lots of light.  I liked it a lot and it was nice to get away from the casinos.  We enjoyed getting coffee in our exploration of the strip and it's nice to stop at the Bellagio for the seasonal floral display and the water show (both free!)

I love going to see the fountains!  It's something fun to do that's FREE!  I like to stop and slow down a bit and this is a great way to do that.  I love that all the shows are different and you never really know what you're going to get-- the music could be Celine Dion ("My Heart Will Go On"), Andrea Bocelli ("Time to Say Goodbye) or music from Chicago the musical.  I make it a point to see at least once every time I'm in Vegas!  Here's a video from 6-14-09:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzsyD-8LMvI

This is the first show I've seen in Vegas... I'm a fan of Holly Madison from watching her on "The Girls Next Door".  I'm happy to see that she is doing well for herself and having fun.  The story & costumes are fun and there is a lot of creativity in the song and dance.  I'm a captive audience member and was surprised by a few of the cool things they did.  I'm glad we didn't get the VIP table seats and got the 2nd row instead.  I don't really like being below the stage and looking up, so take that into consideration if you're contemplating VIP.  We bought 1 drink each at the bar before the show and they were tasty!  Something like a Washington Apple with sour apple pucker & cranberry.  This was a fun outing for a double date and I enjoyed it.  I also think it would be fun to do in a group of ladies during a Bachelorette weekend.  Do I feel the need to see it again?  No, probably not.  It's a one & done thing that I can say I've done!  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11

I love Super Target!  This store has:  department store, groceries,1 hour photo, Starbucks, Pizza Hut Express, and probably more things I couldn't see.   This store is so big that it's hard to see one end of the store from the next!  Friendly service from both of the employees we encountered.  :-)

BAD. AWFUL. THE WORST.  One of the worst dining experiences of my life that I keep trying to forget, but I just can't. And I have to share my experience so that some other well-meaning tourist does NOT give this place a try.   In February, my man and I were visiting his family in the area. We drove to hike at the mountains, but ended up stopping for lunch instead. Our party of 5 arrived at 12:30 on a Sunday. When we asked if they were still open, the waiter replied, "I guess you'll be the last table". Umm, your hours say that you are open until 2pm on Sundays. In this economy, I don't think it's smart to turn business away, but maybe that's just me. This was the first sign of a problem and we should have walked out, but I try to be agreeable and go with the group. It was one awful thing after another: the waiter argued with our drink orders after we told him he brought the wrong thing, it took over 30 minutes to bring our chips & salsa for appetizers and the portions were insanely small. If chips and salsa cost money, you can at least give me more than 25 chips! An hour (yes, 1 hour) after ordering, the food came out 1 dish at a time. The veggie burger was just as ordered and bowl of soup was fine. The sandwich my boyfriend's nephew ordered was with the wrong meat and cheese. We heard a whole bunch of yelling with curse words and couldn't tell where it was coming from, but quickly realized that it was the cook in the kitchen. The cook seemed to be pissed off at what we ordered and didn't want to make it. My chicken sandwich came out next.  I cut it in half to discover that the CHICKEN WAS NOT FULLY COOKED. Seriously disgusting. My boyfriend's trio of "sliders" came out on 3 plates with the beef, pork and other meats partially charred (not in a good way) and the bread haphazardly thrown on top. I don't think it was supposed to be "build it yourself". We heard more yelling from the cook and then heard, "I'm f***ing done with this place" as the cook threw off their apron and stormed out. The waiter was clearly ashamed  and apologized for the cook. After some convincing, he reluctantly removed the chicken sandwich and sliders from our bill and we tried to leave as quickly as possible.  Once again, I would like to say that I hate writing bad reviews.... But if I had read a review similar to mine, we would have never come to this horrible place to "piss off" the cook so much. Lesson learned!  Note to the staff: It would be better to turn business away than give your patrons horrible service and be pissed off yourselves as well.

We flew Spirit Air roundtrip San Diego to Las Vegas.  We waited too long to get our tickets on Southwest, so Spirit Airlines was half the price.  Similar to budget European airlines I've flown in the past (RyanAir & GermanWings) but the planes are SMALLER.  I'm 5'6" and a size 10 and my knees touched the whole time.  See others' photos!  I cannot imagine being on this airplane if I was any taller than 5'6"... big guys beware!  If you do choose to fly Spirit, be prepared by: (1) knowing how much you will be paying for extras (checking bags, etc.) and get the BIG FRONT SEAT, (2) mentally prepping yourself to be crammed into a small space, (3) Eat & drink beforehand or pay a lot, (4) Don't plan on being comfortable during the flight-- find a way to mentally zone out for an hour and you will be fine.  I wouldn't choose to fly Spirit again, but possibly in a pinch.  I would NEVER use them for a flight that is over 1 hour.  I would definitely PAY EXTRA FOR THE BIG FRONT SEAT if I do this again.  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11

At Mandalay Bay there aren't many casual places to get a snack and I'm always eating... Sports Book Grill is hidden in a corner and was a good place to grab a quick bite.  The turkey club sandwich for $11 was stacked high and the fries were tasty.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wJAs37fHi3iqQ8Huym1mGg?select=6TeeKaVwmPCxsNFu0o_ZHw  No complaints here.  I would come back if I stay at Mandalay Bay again.  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11

Friendly service here!  12 tables inside, 2 comfy leather chairs, lots of outside seating. Music wasn't too loud & general mood was mellow.    No drive thru.  Services: Lunch, Oven-warmed Food, Sirena Espresso Machine, Starbucks Card Mobile, Wireless Hotspot.  I was impressed that their food case was so full on a weekday at 2:30pm (see pic): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ITv2jv4rB-UuQwAo2ntjw?select=sSu-8pjsWRNuhXxqu_Omdw  We had a great experience here on a road trip while we were using the Wifi before heading home to CA.

Genius concept, especially in the Vegas airport! Grab some alcohol while you pick up your bags so you have drinks for your hotel room. The cashier answered all of our questions & helped us choose our vodka. The prices are competitive-- not Costco cheap, but definitely cheaper and more convenient than on the Strip!  CHEERS & thanks to Liquor Library!
