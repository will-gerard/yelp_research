Don and Charlie's is the epitome of an old school Chicago char-house. The sports memorabilia on the walls and pictures of celebrities that ate at the restaurant add to the authentic ambiance. The food was delicious and reminded me of home. The chopped liver plate is a must have for an appetizer. The BBQ baby back ribs were awesome and delicious.

Defalco's is half Italian grocery store and half restaurant. The ambiance is very authentic. I had the Italian sausage sandwich which was the featured item on the "Diners Drive Ins and Dives" episode. It was pretty good but nothing too special. I also had the penne with vodka sauce and I thought that was better than the sandwich. On the side I ordered a meatball to have with the pasta and that was good as well. For dessert, I had a cannoli which was great. I also had the chance to talk to the owner who was also in the "Diners Drive Ins and Dives" episode and he seemed like a genuine guy. Overall, great experience and can't wait to come back to try more items on their menu.

After living in AZ for 4 years I finally found a pizza joint worth going to. Spinatos is a great place to get some authentic Chicago style pizza. We got a large thin crust pizza and it was delicious. We also got an order of Caesar salad which was great. Took about 30 minutes for our order to be filled. I will definitely be coming back here.

The service was a bit slow but the food made up for it. The sushi was delicious and the burger was unique and flavorful. We also got the mixed delux fries basket which was phenomenal. I would definitely come back.

Came back here and changed my mind. Probably the best burger I've ever had. Sushi is great too.

Great place to get a big and filling breakfast. Chompies is the closest thing to an authentic Jewish deli in Arizona. Huge menu selection and they serve breakfast all day. Goes without saying, but the Jewish Sliders are a must have. You won't leave here hungry because the portions are humongous. Always have great service and everyone is very friendly.

Amazing service and outstanding food. Mastro's truly is an unparalleled dining experience. The steaks are phenomenal and the side dishes are delicious. The butter cake is a must have for dessert.

After multiple attempts of trying to get a reservation, we finally made it through the doors at The Mission. The ambiance is very nostalgic and it actually feels like your are in a mission. The first thing we ordered was the guacamole because it had been raved about on Yelp. It definitely lived up to the hype. It is prepared table side and you can decide what you want in it and how hot you want it to be. The next things we ordered were the Crispy Pork and Cola Lime Glaze and the Grilled Street Corn off the cob. They both were amazing and I couldn't see how the meal could get any better. For our entrees, we decided to get the Malbec Braised Shortrib and the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos. Both were unreal. The Shortrib was soft and fell apart so easily but remained juicy and tender. It was served with a smear of queso fresco and fingerling potatoes. The tacos were delicious and surprisingly filling given their size. I could taste how fresh the tortilla was and the steak was grilled perfectly. We also had another order of the Grilled Street Corn because it was too good to only have once. To top the meal off, we got the Espresso Churros and Pumpkin Bread Pudding. The Churros were served with a milkshake and the bread pudding was served with a scope of vanilla ice cream. Both were scrumptious and ended the meal perfectly. The experience was terrific and the service was on point. Our server knew the menu from front to back and helped us decide on all of our delicious dishes. Even the bus boys were friendly and polite. I now have a new favorite restaurant in Scottsdale and see why it was so hard to get a reservation all this time.

The avocado pork cheese crisp is a must get for an appetizer. The BBQ pork taco is one of the best tacos I have ever had. Cool modern vibe to the restaurant and great service.

Daily Dose is without a doubt the best breakfast spot in Scottsdale. There is a wide selection of breakfast options and everything that I have had was delicious. I also had a burger once and that was pretty good too. The Breakfast Nachos are a must have and I also recommend Hangover Sandwich. The only negative thing I'd have to say about the restaurant is that the service is sometimes a bit slow. There have been multiple times where I've had a spacey server.

I always come here for lunch and it's fantastic. Great Mediterranean food that is healthy and quick. The service is always great and the food has always been spot on. If you are trying to grab a nice lunch on the go, then eat at Zoe's Kitchen.

Shaving Grace is an awesome place to get a haircut and shave. The guys take a lot of time and effort on each haircut they give and their shaves are the best I've ever had. They don't take too long but it's just long enough to feel like you're getting a quality cut. There's a reason why this place has maintained a 5/5 star rating.

Good service and good place to catch a game. The tot chos were decent but my burger was over cooked. Overall, mediocre experience and may not be returning.

Overpriced for just mediocre wannabe healthy food. I got a Mediterranean bowl with chicken and it was $11. I was expecting it to actually taste good and have something special about it. It didn't. Unfortunately, this place is one of the only healthy places on campus to eat at so I might come back and try something else.

Zipps is my favorite place to watch a game on Mill Ave. It's always fun to come here on game day for ASU home or away games and it's great for Sunday football. I also come here to watch my hometown teams play because they more than likely have the game on one of their many TVs. The food is great as well. I love the buffalo wings and any of the focaccia sandwiches are delicious. The only negative thing I'd have to say is that the service is a little slow sometimes. It has gotten a little better each time I have returned so I will definitely keep coming back here as a regular.

Great place to come for tapas and drinks. Modern vibe and great menu selection. All of the tacos we had were good and the sushi was pretty good too. I would recommend coming here during happy hour because they have a great happy hour menu. The best thing I had was the crunchy tuna tacos. The atmosphere is very trendy and the service was great.

Great place to grab a quick bite during lunch. I had the Matt Cain on Dutch crunch bread. It was delicious. The sandwich came out pretty quickly and everyone who worked there was nice. Overall, great experience and I will definitely be returning.
