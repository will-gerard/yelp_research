Love this place for some decent Thai! Shrimp & Chicken Pad Thai is always good and never disappoints, the soups are great, I also really like their Beef Panang. Their desserts always sound good and they usually have something that involves mango, how I have escaped never trying one is beyond me. Their over all menu is a bit limited and is kept to the basics but what they do have is done well.

This place is just OK in my book. I love the idea... a healthy alternative to fast food but it could be better. The first time I went I liked it but it's also hard to screw up a grilled cheese sandwich. Sooo... I went back and tried it again. My fruit cup was sour, my sandwich was stale and just blah tasting. I could do with out it. It made me sad though... it's so close to work I thought I was going to have a great place for a quick meal that wasn't going to top 1000 calories.

Oh how I love thee. I am going to miss this place. I used to work around the corner and frequent this spot at least 2-3 times per month. I've never had a bad wrap and the rice bowls are good too! The Senorita No Meata is one of my favorites and I love the chips and salsa... it tends to be my side of choice. The parking situation is dumb... don't go at noon. Trust me. If you can carpool that's even better.

Lucky for me this place is right around the corner from the office. I can taste the tuna salad salad as I'm typing this... the poppy seed dressing is SO good. They also have great sandwiches and what not. I've never been for dinner or their brunch though. It's on the smallish side as it's located inside what used to be a home. That would be my only complaint. It's hard to get a small group of friends in there. I've always had good service and even though it tends to be a popular spot I've never had to wait more than 10 min which is great when you have a limited lunch hour.

Having a small daughter, walking the malls around here gets old. A friend and I recently took our girls to the zoo and had a great time. 99% of the zoo is stroller friendly. I think the only place I had to park it was the petting zoo and the monkey enclosure. Over all the zoo is beautiful and very well kept, even for it's age. I love that some of the exhibits really show off Arizona's beautiful landscape.   I highly recommend packing a lunch and eating in the picnic area though as food is abnormally high priced, even for a zoo/amusement park.   Also, if you think you'd use it, BUY A MEMBERSHIP! It's like $75 for two adults and two children and you don't always have to take a spouse, you can bring a guest! Kids under 2 are free anyhow but at $16 each for adults it's totally worth it after just a couple of visits.

Good but not great. The first time  I went I was a little disappointed with my sandwich options... a total of 3 plus a "market sandwich". Granted I am usually content with anything including Mozzarella however this one didn't leave a lasting impression and I haven't been back since that first encounter. I will say that doesn't mean I won't be back I just think my order will be a bit different the next go-round. Other reviews seem to have really enjoyed that particular sandwich so I will give them the benefit of the doubt for now and a four star rating rather than a three and say that *MAYBE* I went on an off day.

LOVE LOVE LOVE! Being from the Bay Area I am all about a nice loungy atmosphere. This spot is right up my ally! Great music, chill vibe and good drinks. It's dimly lit and they play some good down tempo house music. My dirty Sapphire martini's were excellent... and they should be at $11a pop. I expected this place to be rather snobbish from what I had heard from a few people but I found it quite the opposite. It was a good mix of people, I'll say it was an "older crowd" but certainly not in a bad way. It just wasn't a bunch of random college age kids getting drunk and being stupid.

YUM. Seriously YUM. Thanks to Brandi L for introducing me to this fabulous strip mall find.The potato-macaroni salad alone is worth the trip to this spot. I adore the bulkogi but really, everything I have had here is very good. Stop by if you are ever in the area. In fact... I think I might do a pick up today!

The hubs and I are suckers for some good Pho and we haven't found better in Phoenix since we moved here. The restaurant itself is nothing special but what does one expect when you can get two bowls of pho, two drinks, and crispy spring rolls for under $15? We've never eaten anything else there but in the cooler months we eat here at least 3 times a month... sometimes more =)

I feel very fortunate to live so close to my love, Pita Jungle. The best roasted red pepper hummus and everything I have ever tried has been perfect. A standard favorite is the pesto pizza and a fabulous recent discovery is the philly chicken pita. I love this place for a healthy alternative and I could totally eat here twice a week. Lots of great veg friendly options, also a bonus!

I could just copy and paste Kristin S' review since we were a part of the same group that went. Kudos for giving our large group of girls two tables together but BOOO for making us wait so long. Not only was it a half hour after our reservation time but people got there early to warn them of our partys arrival. Our reservation had been down at least a week in advance, it could have been better planned on their part but anyway. The food here is crap... unless you like everything flavored with nothing but soy sauce, don't bother going. I always loved Benihana as a kid and either I grew up and learned what good food really is or this place seriously went to crap. The show sucked, the drinks were weak and expensive and the food was bland. I took my leftovers home to my husband who said "I thought you went to benihana, this tastes like ****" and that was promptly followed by the "did we just grow up because I thought it used to be good conversation."

Seriously... It's just a sandwich people. You can dress up bread as much as you want but if you don't do it right, don't brag about it. I've had WAY better. Two stars because they gave me a cookie.

Very, VERY good Italian! The decor is romantic, I would say it's a good date spot. My husband and I took my mom and sister there moments after we told her I was pregnant so again... so alcohol sampling for me, I promise to go back and update this at a later time. We had the calamari appetizer which was actually very good seeing as how AZ so rarely gets anything fresh. We all ordered and we all enjoyed so much that we had to share. The husband and I shared the Tirimisu for dessert while my sister ordered the Chocolate Souffle. Our Tirimisu was divine and the Souffle was just OK. Definitely recommend this place! It's even rather quiet and surprisingly not as busy as I would imagine with the quality of food.

The is our favorite place for breakfast. We take everyone here when they visit from out of town. We've never had a bad meal out of all the times we've eaten here. I have been to several of the locations and they are all fabulous food and service wise. The lunch menu is yummy too! They offer some healthy choices as well which is always important!

Great place to watch a game!  Our neighbors introduced us to this place and we love it! It's a great place to go and have a few beers and watch the game. It became somewhat of a weekly tradition for us. Great beers (and a damn good bloody mary!) good food... and all around good place to hang out. It tends to be rather noisy there, even on a non game day/night so I definitely don't recommend it as a date spot unless you don't plan on doing a whole lot of talking =)   They have a decent brunch menu on Sundays but I prefer their regular menu items.

Best toasted subs... EVER. I order the White Widdow and pretty much stick to that. It's awesome. The cheesy garlic bread... delish! Try it with pepper jack =) This place is a regular for us when we want a good sandwich. Hey... even my mom loves this place.

It's become quite apparent that GREAT Chinese food is hard to find in Arizona... well... we've pretty much found it. This is one of two places we go and it's always been excellent. They have a huge menu and dinner specials for 2 or 4. The service is quick and the hot tea is quite tasty =)

My burger really was very good. I must say though... the sweet potato fries are WAY better at FEZ. You have to admit, Fez fries are hard to beat. I have only ever been for lunch so I can't say much about the drinks and what not. It's usually pretty busy, I try to go early or late. I have tried to do pick up and it wasn't my brightest idea. I had asked for my meal to be ready by a specific pick up time and by the time I got it, it was already soggy. Ick. I'll stick to dine in. So much for trying to beat the crowd.

I don't know why it took me so long to come here! A few girls and I got together to celebrate mine and another friends birthdays and Fez was the spot. OK... 3 words SWEET.POTATO.FRIES.  To die for! The hummus was also delish as was my sandwich. Being that we were there for a celebration, Thomas and staff went above and beyond to accommodate our group at lunch hour. Everyone enjoyed the food, the atmosphere is adorable and the service was impeccable. I can't wait to bring my husband here!

I went for lunch and I'd love to review it again going for dinner. I went with a co-worker and we both chose the sandwich sampler. Though the 3 sandwiches appear to be small they definitely do the trick and are the perfect portion size. Our service was good and I was glad to have gotten there by 11:30 as it was a packed house shortly after. A nice place for lunch, I'd love to go back and sample some of the salads and other sandwiches even though the menu is a bit limited at lunch time.

Two words. Emerald Chicken! I chose to have mine in a quesadilla and it was fabulous, but it also makes a mighty fine burrito! Newbs... make sure to get a lesson in ordering because it will be a bitch if you don't know what you're doing and also make sure to taste EVERYTHING they offer you. It's all so very delicious. I also really like the Jade chicken. It's not what you'd think when you hear Asian Mexican fusion... it's much better!

This place makes me a happy girl. It's just bonus that it's next to the Trader Joe's I frequent. They sell both new and used books which IMO is pretty awesome. They have a decent selection of used books but not the best OR it could be that they just sell out of the good used stuff quickly. They have a fun selection of novelty items and a cozy atmosphere. I could spend hours in here looking at everything.

My mom and I tried this place out before hitting the mall during her most recent visit to town. Our first impression was the space and decor. It's very large and open, contemporary and easy to people watch... one of our favorite sports. We came after lunch and just before dinner on a Sunday. There was a significant crowd giving the time of day and day of the week. They were only serving flatbread and dinner salads at the time and we settled on sharing two flatbreads. I ordered the Pesto and she the Fig & Prosciutto along with a  pitcher of the white sangria.   We sat in the bar area in some leather couches and sofas that line the bar. Very comfortable but we could have done with a larger table being that there were only two of us and we had a hard time managing in a space that was meant for 4.  The Pesto flatbread was my favorite of the two. Roasted garlic cloves, lots of cheese, fresh tomato... what more could one want? The pesto was very good and gave the perfect amount of flavor. It was my ideal flatbread. The fig & prosciutto was good as well. It was a very unexpected pairing with fig, prosciutto, goat cheese and spinach. Being that goat cheese is one of my favorites, I felt like it was lacking. I probably wouldn't order this again but it wasn't tragic either by any means, just not exactly my taste. The white sangria was great. Very refreshing and an interesting combination of juices and flavors. I just wish that the pitcher wasn't more ice than sangria.   Our service wasn't fantastic nor was it awful as others have described.   Although I didn't order off of it the wine list was very extensive but it was also on the pricey side.

If you've never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out. I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place. I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house. If you've never heard of it, this is how it goes down. It's a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of "sauce" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey. You mix it all together and there you have it. A somewhat healthy dessert! They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =)   This place isn't just all about the bingsoo though. They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too!

I really enjoyed Fuego. I went with an old coworker who is an uber-foodie to say the least. We would attempt 1 new to both of us restaurant at least once a week. Fuego was my choice. Being that my family is from Argentina I get some AMAZING South American home cooking, not to mention my own mad cooking skillz passed down from my Abuela. This place is a little tucked away and only has about 10 tables in the dining area. We got there right at noon and took the second to last table available and there was a steady stream of people coming and going as we sat. I had the Pan Con Ropa Vieja, a braised beef sandwich. My beef was so tender and flavorful! My uber-foodie friend did not LOVE it though but I can also say that she isn't a huge fan of South American cuisine. The service was also great!

Did I die and go to dessert heaven? White chocolate is my favorite edible thing and their desserts definitely deliver. My favorite is the white chocolate banana cream pie. Get it... you won't be sorry. I have also had the pleasure of trying the white chocolate brownie and white chocolate bread pudding, both amazing as well.   As far as the restaurant and food itself... the food is good for a "high-ish end" chain grill. I had the Parmesan crusted steak (it was cooked perfectly) and my garlic mashed potatoes were fabulous but let me talk about the appetizer. I was pregnant the last time we went, so it could be the hormones talking BUT I know a good artichoke when I get one. It's not many places you can order a grilled artichoke appetizer and this place made me one extremely happy pregnant lady because it was one of the best I've ever had.

I love Oregano's! Plan for a wait though. My friend and I try and go on a fairly regular basis and we just plan to wait and have drinks so it's not really a big deal. We love the Pesto Pizza which is a thin crust, with duh... Pesto, tomato and cheese. It's rather simple but oh so yummy! Their whole wheat crust is yummy too. Their salads are huge so make sure to share and don't forget to order a pizookie. You won't be sorry! With 3 flavors to choose from and all three sampled the classic chocolate chip is by far the best!   Deep dish pizzas take like 45 min to make so plan for that also. It's one of the reasons we always order a thin crust!

Oh Monkeypants and I go way back. The first time I went I thought I could hang with my 21yo neighbors... we had a fantastic time. Great drinks, fun atmosphere. Younger crowed but it wasnt full of college aged jerks. Make sure to stick around for the 1:00 shirtless shot, it's free so that means it's something everyone should be involved with... at least once.

Sprouts always puts a huge smile on my face. I love it here. Yesterday was my most recent trip and I went for some very specific items. I make all of my daughters baby food so I went for fruits and veggies for her. I came home with 1 bag organic carrots, 1 bag organic peas, 5 organic apples, 3 sweet potatoes, 4 pears, 2 acorn squash, and 4 peaches. My total came to just over $16. At 55 cents and up for a jar of baby food... you do the math! This will feed her for well over a month!   I do shop here on a regular basis for my fruits, veggies and grains. They have a huge selection of bins housing grain, nuts, fruits, trail mix and candies. Always a fabulous selection of health items like vitamins, I am a huge tea drinker and they always stock my favorites. The employees are friendly and always willing to answer questions. They usually have some meats that catch my eye for dinner that night... stuffed pork chops and the like. They carry this amazing hummus by Oasis Naturals, my favorite is the artichoke but the jalapeno is also divine. Make sure to pick one up!   All in all I don't find the prices to be unreasonable in the least, they always have what I am looking for and they run some amazing weekly sales!

I am shocked to see such a low rating for Kobe and Benihana gets more stars? Seriously? I noticed most of the reviews are for sushi here and I have only had tepanyaki. We had a great experience here. Granted the miso and salad are nothing to rave about, but are they ever? You don't go to tepan for miso and salad with ginger dressing. My experience here was better in every way, shape and form compared to the Benihana in Scottsdale, but thats a whole other review.  We were seated promptly and or drink orders were taken while we waited 5 min for our table to fill up. They took our orders as we were ready to give them and we waited for our chef. He was seriously a lot of fun, I wish I could remember his name! They might charge an extra $2 for fried rice but the free saki shots made up for that. Our food was prepared perfectly as ordered and we got the standard flipping food at someones mouth and one of the better onion volcanos I've seen. I'm sad to see this place have such a low rating as my experience was great!

Betty Crocker makes a better cupcake. A friend and I couldn't wait to try these. We'd heard so much about them so we woke up early on a Friday and got to the store before it opened to avoid lines. Good thing we did because 5 min after walking in the door I turned around and the tiny storefront was PACKED and the line was going out the door. I bought a half dozen and my total came to ALMOST $30... for some damn cupcakes. RIDICULOUS. I waited until I got home so my husband and I could both dig in and discuss. Strawberry is my favorite cupcake flavor so it was the first one I tried. I can't even describe my disappointment with not only the strawberry but with every single flavor I bought. Moist? Yes. Bursting with flavor? Absolutely not. We tried Red Velvet, Strawberry, Pumpkin, Black & White, Chocolate and Vanilla and honestly I wouldn't go back. I'd much rather have one from a box than this over priced and over hyped shop.

ALL I WANTED WAS SOME FREAKING TORTILLA SOUP!!!  ...  We were seated immediately which was fabulous. Then... no one even LOOKED at our table for 15, yes 15 minutes. When our waiter finally decided to show up it took another 5 min to get our drinks and we both had soda. Totally unacceptable. Then we wait another 15 min for our order to be taken. Thank god our food came out when it did because I was ready to walk out the door. Two stars because I happen to love their tortilla soup and they have a fun and lengthly drink menu. I may never go back after this though.

Another place I am THRILLED to be in walking distance of. I love this spot! Great beers on tap which makes me happy and I love me some fried mushrooms to snack on while I'm there as for foodI really have only had a salad there, which was good... it was a salad... ya know? I can't say anything about the rest of the menu.  I must add that I loathe St.Patrick's day every year BUT only because it royally screws with traffic when I'm trying to get home. This place is poppin every year! It's totally the place to be. =)

4 Fabulous stars! My mom and her boyfriend were in town and I have heard good things about this place so we decided to check it out. My spring mix salad was good, but standard. Let's face it, we did NOT go for the salad anyway. I ordered the Parmesan crusted Sand Dabs with my two choices as garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. My Sand Dabs were fabulous! I had only had them one other time at McCormick & Schmicks and I think these were just a tad bit better. They were perfectly fried. I must admit the sides were a tad bit lacking. My husband ordered the Mexican coconut shrimp and they were quite good as well. Mom's boyfriend ordered Halibut Almondine and was in love at first bite. My mom had a salmon dish and she was also quite pleased with her choice. Now. I can over look the standard salad and the slightly ordinary sides but this place gets -1 solid star for the dessert. I ordered creme brule... one of my favorites. It tasted like it was from a box. A standard custard... Blech! I held out on dessert every other night we went out to dinner and this place was quite a disappointment. Now on the other hand my husband and mom both devoured their bread pudding with out complaint and the mom's boyfriend claimed his key lime pie was only second to one and that's saying A LOT.   Now. This place COULD have been 3 stars but they got the bump up for the following reasons:  -Fresh fish flown in with menus printed daily  -I caught a buzz off two martinis.  -We were all happy with our selections which is quite a feat.   Should have been 3 stars because:  -price is on the higher side... I'd rather go to McCormick & Schmicks for the price  -crappy desserts.   I admit I am a little surprised to see some of the reviews at 1 or 2 stars. We had great service and our food came out in a timely manner, as did our drinks.

I am so very lucky to have F&E on my corner! My neighbor works there and is always bringing us goodies and coupons. It's perfect when we need to just "run to the store real fast". I love their meats but I do find the produce pricy and to be honest... sometimes I just don't need 3 zuchini. They carry just about everything I need on a weekly basis. The prepackaged meals are decent but 99% of the time I'd rather cook my own. I grab them if I know time will be short for dinner that night or whatever. All of the F&E brand packaged foods and drinks I have tried have been great. The peanutbutter granola bars... wow. =) The drinks are awesome *ahem* mango lemonade! They also cary a variety of major name brand stuff as well. They have a decent wine selection with fun stuff to try on a regular basis. It's always clean, the staff is always friendly and helpful. It's self check out but the majority of the time some one will come and scan or bag for you... sometimes you get both! This place makes me smile.

5 huge stars for this perfectly organized scrap booking store. Huge HUGE paper selection and anything else you could possibly need for your scrapbook. Books, ribbon, stencils, stamps cute little adornments... I can't wait to go back! I was with a friend and we shopped for wall letters along with paper to scrap them. She left with a full set of letters and a huge assortment of papers and adornments for under $35. Impressive.

BOOO! I was working on a craft project for my daughters room Good ol Martha Stewart informed me that I should use a product called Homasote. I went online to find out where I could get it, since it's a green product I thought I might have trouble finding it. Apparently all Home Depots in my area carry it. I go in and I ask very nicely for someone to point me in the right direction. Just shy of being laughed at I was told they never heard of it and pretty much dismissed when I tried to tell them what it was and ask if they had anything comparable. Turns out Lowes was a MUCH bigger help. They didn't carry the product but they had a green material very similar and my project is now finished and looking very cool. I don't think I'll be back to this location. I'll just drive my happy ass down two blocks further at Lowes.

Holy hobby heaven!!! A friend and I went to check this place out on Monday and WOW. We are both in love and very thankful neither of us lives closer than we do. This place is HUGE and stocks things for hobbies I didn't even know existed. I can't wait to go back and do some major damage now that I have found my inner Suzie Homemaker. Not only did they stock stuff for a wide variety of hobbies they also stock a ton of stuff for each hobby... I hope that makes sense. Fabric, yarn, paper and decor galore! I looove this place!

So I went back today for some scrapbooking supplies and seriously... almost everything I needed was 50% off. You can't ask for better deals. I bought fabric for another project I am working on and that was even 30% off.   Did I mention this store has EVERYTHING?  I had also gone to Paper Vineyard earlier in the morning and noted the price on some tools, they were on average $5 cheaper at Hobby Lobby.

I drive by this spot on my way into work (come see me at Nordstrom's MAC counter next time you go to chandler mall!) and I have been wanting to try it for a few weeks now. The in-laws were in town and kindly watched our daughter so we could have a date night. We decided on dinner and a movie. I suggested adorable little place since it was just on the other side of the mall from the movie theater. We parked and since we didn't know what to expect of the menu, we were reading the posted menu on the window when the FOH & Catering Manager, Scott, came out to greet us and invite us in. There was live music and a very warm ambiance to the restaurant. It was very cozy and friendly, however, we were by a good twenty years the youngest couple in there. There was live music, a man singing easy listening hits from Lionel Ritchie to Barry White to the Isley Brothers. We were seated immediately and had a very attentive but not annoyingly so waitress. We ordered the panko breaded asparagus appetizer which was served with a balsamic vinegar reduction, they were simply amazing. Our salads came out and they were your standard mixed greens and assortment of veggies. I ordered the Goat Cheese Stuffed Shrimp which was served around of bed of linguine and it was FAB-U-LOUS. I enjoyed every moment of it. Jason ordered the Catfish Gumbo. He loved the gumbo itself but he said the catfish was slightly lacking on it's own but when paired together it was perfect. The service here was fantastic. We felt like it was a bargain for how satisfied we were with our experience. We will definitely be going back AND now I know a great little hide away where I can sneak off to go have a quiet lunch away from work!

Very yummy breakfast! We met my mom here on her way out of town and had an excellent meal. My blueberry pancakes were fantastic. My husband had some sort of egg and meat concoction and it was great as well. My mom was quite pleased with her veggie omelet. Despite being busy our wait wasn't long and the service was quick.

LOVE!!! This place is awesome. It's great itialian at a decent price in a casual atmosphere. I've never had a bad meal but the Linguini in white clam sauce may very well be my favorite along side the lasagna. They have an excellent house salad as well. I've heard the pizza is good but we've never tried it. Yum... I love this place! I'm so glad we live so close =)
