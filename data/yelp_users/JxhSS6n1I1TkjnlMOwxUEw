Food was good...service was horrible. We had the most obnoxious sever that was so rude last night for a birthday dinner. I will not be back.

We came here last night- the food was good. Our mussels were a little over cooked, the veal and penne pasta was solid and service was great. I do wish there was more of an ambiance in there, it's a bit bright for a dinner restaurant/date night.

This is such an AMAZING work out. Nothing like you've ever experienced before, and it completely life/body changing. The teachers are so inspirational. I highly recommend anyone to try it once, be careful, you might get addicted! xo

It's hard to give this place two stars, because I really like the atmosphere here. However, the service was lacking and has been for quite some time now. I don't get to go out much during the week, so I always count on a good meal and good service when going out during the weekend with a group of friends. The past few times I've been here, I've been more than disappointed with the service, despite the consistent chances I've given this place. Our server said "no" or "I don't believe so" or "I will have to check to see if we still have that available" or "I think we are out"- it was absolutely horrible!! She didn't know anything. On top of that, our food came out all at random times, in no order, over an HOUR and we ordered everything at the same time. These were just simple appetizers! I'm sad to say this because I really believe this place has so much potential with its location- but with the continuous lack of service I've received over time, I will not be back.

I love this place so much. I've had nothing but great experiences dining here with friends and family. I love their pizzas and they always have something fun for specials and their drink selection is on point. Ginger was so great! I will definitely be back.

My boyfriend and I stumbled across this little gem while driving around on a Friday night. Loved it. Service was great and the food was so yummy for the right price! We're coming back.

Went here for a little bday celebration and it was absolutely fantastic. The service was great and staff was so friendly and the food-was so fresh and cooked to perfection.  I had the special fish dish- the sol and we had the chicken and prawns with a side of grilled asparagus. So yum! We will definitely be back.

We had a great time here celebrating a friends bday- they brought us all a round of champagne to celebrate (and it was good champagne :-)) food was good- the noodles weren't my favorite- but the salmon was incredible. The staff was the best part and so accommodating- we will be back!

I came here last night for dinner and we loved it! We had a few apps and the kale salad as we were grabbing a quick bite before a friends bday. We had the octopus, (it was really good!) the cured salmon (I wish this was presented differently- with a bread and cheese or something- it was flat on a plate with arugula and was our least favorite) , and we had the mussels (loved these). The kale salad was on point as well. Service was great and very friendly- only thing I would add to this place is some music? Strange to me they didn't have anything playing- but that's a quick fix all in all- we will definitely be back to try some entrees!!

Alison comes with years of health and wellness knowledge and really knows how to cater her classes to beginners, intermediates and experienced Pilate goers! It was my first time and she really helped me understand the mechanics of how Pilates is so beneficial for your body. I took this class with a couple girlfriends and we had a blast. We will be coming back regularly! Xo
