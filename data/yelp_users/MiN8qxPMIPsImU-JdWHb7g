DO NOT trust your children's health and your financial heath to these providers and for profit company. We had an issue in 2013 causing us to seek out a new pediatrician for our daughter. I cancelled our next appointment. The office still tried billing us $25 for a no show when we cancelled. I refused. Fast forward a few years (we did move) now our credit is being hit every month, finally i drilled down to find it stemming back to this $25 fee...but now the bill $166.66 wanted by a collections agency. This has caused financial damages to our credit. They refuse to work with us, now claiming it was "submitted to insurance."  How is a late fee submitted to insurance??? Lies. They also admit their billing system was indeed inaccurate at the time...but since "upgraded" We have sought legal consult but the fees are not worth it. Good job stealing $166.66 from hard working parents who left your practice for better practitioners. I tried to speak with the billing department in which the lady started to raise her voice "do you want an explanation or not?!?" finally got to a manager, but at the end of the day will end up paying. horrible experience.

Today I went in for a return without a receipt, prepared that they would give me the lowest price, which I was fine with and prepared for. They scanned my ID and told me I can't return more than $70 worth of  Target items in a calendar year! Wow, just wow.

Horrible management. Jurassic world was sold out at 3pm, no big deal...it is opening week. Our family and other ethical citizens wait patiently in the delegated line for the 430 showing . A big Hispanic man 20 min before they open the theater  comes up complaining about starting in a line to management.... Mind you he is wearing clear gang paraphernalia. So what does the manager do? Lets the man and his entourage cut to the front of the line of about 60 people who like us were waiting for almost an hour. Kudos Harkins management way to give in to intimidation and I am so glad that a man using explicits is just given what he wants. Great values. Awesome standards. How about trying to move him... descalation or calling authorities. You pleased someone who was cursing, threatening, and not following rules while showing those of us that are patient and respectful that if you complain and are rude enough.... harkins will just bend over. Stellar. You deserve a gold star! the movie was okay... restrooms clean... but snack bar employees that can only do one task at a time, so that was irritating. Also it was an over filled theater... Turing people away with tickets... poor planning. This experience reminded me why I rarely come to the movies. It is safer and more enjoyable at home. Thank you for the experience it will save me a lot of money in the near future.... it all comes down to customer service and how you respond to situations. I am not the only person I am sure who feels this way after today.

We LOVE Dominic's and have been in twice in the last few weeks. We are new to the area. Today was our second time in and the waitress remembered where we like to sit and even what we ordered after one visit. They have great lunch specials, yummy food, and excellent customer service!

If I could give them 0 stars I would I'm so irritated! In all honesty I've been going here for 3 years and it just keeps going downhill but today topped it off I was rushed in because they were so busy did not get a chance to choose my color. Instead of sitting and relaxing getting a pedicure and then my nails done they did both the same time the entire process took less than 20 minutes and I paid $70. Both the ladies were clearly making fun of me talking in a different language because they could not find my color which I knew the brand and number as labeled but they would not let me get up to pick it out. They would not let me leave and they would not fix the color just kept saying this will be fine. They did a terrible job on my gel manicure there's bumps in it and it doesn't go all the way to the end of the nail plus my toes are only one coat and you can see through... it looks like a five year old painted my fingernails. Do not go! Do not waste your money! I I spent plenty of time and money here in the past and one experience.... I am so mad I will never be back! Do not go estrella nails off of Lake pleasant parkway!

CHECK YOUR BILL and bank statements! They make false late charges, double charge then blame you. The ledger is completely inaccurate! Customer service is rude when you call to question charges. We had a leak and our bill was 5 times the normal amount. We have been at the same residence for 4 years... at what point would the company recognize a leak? % times the usage is not normal... what a waste of water in the desert... sure do care about their resources...not. But oh no... we are responsible. Worst customer service, (Edward D, they billed me 2x without permission as well) This will be reported to BBB. Looking for input to further audit  and report this company...

Good Feet is the solution I have been looking for and you can't beat the customer service! Go in and talk to Bonnie! I found out about GoodFeet at a local home show. They measured my feet, took a print, and educated me about thier insert solutions. I wasn't sure if it was worth it, I tried them on but did not buy yet. (Even though my feet immediately felt better and had immediate better posture with the inserts in) Every day since the show I regretted not getting them, then I heard the radio ad and over Christmas my aunt was talking about how awesome the sandal solutions were. I finally went in and got my inserts. I LOVE them. Best part, the staff at Good feet fits you to the perfect inserts. If you get the package, they replace them for life and guarantee them! WOW, no drug store bought insert does that and it is cheaper than the molds from the podiatrist that last for only 6 months. I am going to be a Good Feet Customer for life!

I LOVE Dutch Bros! Even more so than the coffee I LOVE the customer service. Just going puts me in a better mood. Trust me, I know... it is so hard to find good people to work for you. However they do it as a company... every single employee at this location is upbeat, kind, energetic, helpful, and on top of it! Thanks for always making my day!

This is THE BEST website design company! I have now trusted 2 websites in the hands on My Biz Niche. This will be worth your time and investment, trust me. I had not one, but three companies work on my first concept, all disappointing in design, time line delivery, or cost. Finally I met Shawn and WOW the difference is stunning. Their project managers communicate constantly and effectively, stay on timeline, and deliver a beautiful, sticky, and traffic driving site. I wasted so much time before finding them, you owe it to yourself to give them a call. I trust them forever with my sites. Amazing work!
