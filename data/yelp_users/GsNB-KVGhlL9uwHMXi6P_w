Blah, worst coffee ever. Had this place 2 weeks ago and I will never come back. Their drip coffee tasted watered down, overpriced and it was by far the shittiest coffee I have ever had. I would much rather get my coffee from AM/PM then ever walk into this place again. Horrible.

My creepy best friend is a huuuuuuuuuuge Green Bay Packers fan. He's a Mexican that grew up in LA. Go figure.   My birthday just passed and we decided to gather a bunch of people and party like it was 1999. We took a few tables, I drank like a sailor, and had their mouth watering wings. The burger I had here was very very...tasty. Yes, yes...tasty.   The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a lady singing who should not quit her day job. Bless her soul, she had the heart of a champion, but a bar like this is probably not the best place to be discovered. Other than that, this place is pretty mighty morphin power awesome.   I still think Green Bay isn't that great, but that is coming from a Raiders fan. :(

Goldie's is a typical sports bar, great atmosphere, decent T.V. placement and good food. Their burgers are amazing! ( I personally have the 1000 Island Burger with Avocado/Bacon/Mushrooms), The burgers are big and juicy and filling.   I  completely agree with Brian, the first few times that i went during peak hours the place was riddled with children, it reminded me of the Wal-Mart's that you find in south phoenix. Too many kids for a sports bar, but i just couldn't stay away from the burgers. I recommend going there for a late evening meal or  during off peak times to avoid getting kicked/punched in the head by the children.

If you are ever in the need for car audio equipment, "Sounds Good To Me" is the place to be at.   I went in today because i needed help with the settings for amplifier and I was instantly greeted by Mark as soon as I entered the shop.  I explained the issue that i was seeing with my amp and right away he helped me resolve the problem. He was very helpful and knowledgeable. Check em out!

I've been coming to this place for the last 5 years, the staff is always friendly and this place is really clean. The barbers are very professional and well trained. This isn't one of those gay salon's that will massage your head while giving you a reach around, this is a real mans salon.   If you just want to get a fucking haircut with no lame gimmicks, then this is the place for you!

On Sunday my family was here visiting from California and after a day of shopping, this Wal-mart was the most convenient location for me to shop for some quick groceries.   Upon walking into this Wal-mart, the unprofessionalism of the staff at this location was shocking to me, and this Wal-mart was very unmaintained.  The door greeter was hitting on some girl and they had an "Asset Protection" employee going along with it. Ignoring that, we continued our shopping, upon checkout the cashier demanded everyone's IDs for the beer we were purchasing. I explained to the cashier that the purchase was being made by my father and I was not going to be involved in the consumption of the liquor but she still demanded to see everyone's IDs. I understand that stores can set their own liquor policies but the rudeness of this staff member was ridiculous. I also explained to her that their policy was faulty, and asked her why she is carding all the adults but not the children. I walked away to avoid further confrontation while my father purchased everything else.  Upon exiting this Wal-mart, their "Asset Protection" asked to see my receipt. Obviously this Wal-mart is run by idiots who do not understand that they cannot ask to see someone receipt without either a written statement placed in plain view explaining that they reserve the right to see receipts (Fry's Electronics), or written in the contract upon joining a club store (Costco, Sam's).   This Wal-Mart is a joke and should be avoided.

Eric said " Best haircuts in North Phoenix " but he forgot to include, "if you like bruises and whiplash". I came to this place once and never came back.   This place is fu**ing dark, creepy and downright scary. So i took a seat in the barbers chair and he went to work. This guy beat the living hell out of my head. I left there with scratches and bruises! I will admit, the fade was great ( Hence the additional star), but too bad my fu**ing head looked like i got into a fight with a wild Cheetah to enjoy it.

A week ago, while I was on my way to work, the "low fuel" light on my car turned on. So, I decided to go to Costco to fill up. Got there, filled up, hopped back in my car, and it wouldn't start. It was dead. D.E.A.D. dead. :( The attendant was awesome. He quickly ran over and helped me push by behemoth of an SUV out of the way, so as not to block the pumps. He even asked if I needed to call someone for help. I really admire the caliber of employees Costco hires.   The reason I only give 4 stars is that the location is terrible. It's in an awkward location, which prevents easy access.

From the outside this place looks decent, and something about the 9 neon signs covering the windows that draws you to this location.   Upon entering, this place the first thing you notice is how terrible the inside looks. The tile flooring resembles the bathrooms that you might be encounter in tijuana or rocky point bar.   Ordering can be interesting, and due to a lack of a menu, and but they have handy pamphlets. The wife and I both ordered a Carnitas burrito And tacos.   The food was edible, and bland, and flavorless. The Carnitas were cut into cubes, and it had quite a large amount of fat, and a ton of onions. The carne asada tacos were full of onions too. The food was flavorless and generic.   I will never come here again.

Walking into this place feels like walking into my home. You might be wondering why it feels like my home, and that's because I used to live in a barn. No, really, I did. The best thing about coming here is the cookin'. If the wife could cook this good, she would probably get more kisses from me. The pancakes taste like pancakes. The bacon is very crunchy and thick. The hashbrown casserole is very hashbrown casseroley. It tastes the way food should taste! I would recommend this place!  A++ WOULD BUY AGAIN!

I love wings, absolutely love them... and you can tell how much i love them by my pictures... anyways, Santisi has awesome wings..  The atmosphere can be a bit creepy at times and pretty dark, they have ton of TV's all tuned towards some sort of sport or game. Usually there is a lot of seating unless their is some sort of big game going on or its Friday night.   The food there is awesome.. Great/awesome wings, the ribs there rock, the pizza is awesome too. The beer prices are good, and i reasonable. The waitresses are mostly hot, and really nice. Out of the 20+ times I've only had one "interesting experience" there (and no it didn't involve little people).  I would definitely recommend this place.  One note. Although it's a kid friendly bar, i wouldn't recommend bringing your kid there.

I hate needles, they scare the hell out of me. I really hate having to get my blood test done, i always choose this location. Not because i have a choice, but because I'm usually in a hurry to get back to work.   This place is a bit grungy looking, and it could probably use a couple of layers of paint, the staff in the front counter are usually annoyed, but i can sometimes sympathize with the staff. It's always crowded and the seats usually run out quickly.   SCHEDULE AN EFFING APPOINTMENT, if you want to be in an out this place quickly. I usually get in and out in 30 mins. Other than that this place is alright, the phlebotomist's there are all really nice, and they have never missed a vain.

It doesn't get better than this. The food here is delicious and almost magical.  I Ordered the Chicken fried rice, with refried beans, Jade red chicken and Teriyaki chicken. It was perfect. The Jade red chicken is perfectly sweetened and damn right delicious. The beans were almost like the one's i grew up eating. This is a must try if you're ever in the phoenix area!

When my wife dropped me off i was a bit scared of walking in,  the outside looks a bit shabby and its not in best of areas and it can be a bit hard to find. As soon i walked in i was instantly impressed!  The place is comfortable and really nice. They have a couple T.V.'s, Pool Tables, Juke-Box, awesome sound system and an awesome staff. Like Daren mentioned, they have a little 7x11 outdoor patio for people that want to smoke and the drink prices are extremely reasonable.  I unfortunately did not have the food there, not because it looked bad, but i had just had dinner before showing up. My best friend said that the burgers there were amazing. I would definitely recommend going there!

Amazing coffee! The first time the wife and i walked into this coffee shop we were impressed and how beautifully decorated this joint was. The staff is very nice and helpful, the ladies behind the counter were pretty hot.   we were served quickly and their coffee is outstanding, and its awesome when you're hungover!

Why the 5 star review you say?... well the fact that gas is the cheapest here earns there them the 5 star rating. Yes this costco can be filled with people and yes there are a lot of old people here, yet this costco is amazing.  The staff here has always been helpful and the facilities here are really well kept. The Optometrist here is pretty awesome and he soo nice. I would definitely recommend this costco.

This Wal-mart I would say, is one of the nicest ones around.  The landscape company that their management uses does a great job at keeping the outside looking awesome and well preserved.  The store itself is pleasant, the wife and I have been visiting this Wal-mart, since we moved out here to Phoenix and have gone out of our way to come to  this store. The weirdo level is lower than all the other Wal-marts around the valley, so it is a little bit more comfortable for us normal folks to shop at. A big plus is that our bank is located inside the store, so it makes it easier to blow your paycheck.

Being a native Californian and a Mexican i crave tacos, but i crave authentic tacos and not that fake "white-washed" tacos. I want the real shizzle. So when i heard that there was an "Authentic" taco shop close to work, i instantly knew that i had to try the tacos there.   So I pull up and this place is located in a pretty ugly strip mall, but my craving for tacos had me dash for the door. The place is pretty small and clean. So i ordered an "Al Pastor" burrito and 2 tongue tacos. The food was mediocre at best. The tongue was hard and too rubbery, i was really unimpressed. I personally will never walk back into this joint.

Being a guy I'm not supposed to enjoy being pampered  but this place brought out the "me gusta" face in me. The chicks inside this place are pretty hot, so that is a definitive draw. The service was good, the wife and I showed up there without an appt and we were serviced fairly quickly. The MANecure I received was quick and done right. I would definitely recommend their services to everyone.

Tried them this weekend and i was rather impressed. The burgers were good, and i would definitely try getting something other than a single. Fries were tasty, and well salted.  Personally i prefer thicker fries, but at the moment the shoe string fries did the trick.The dining area was nice and clean. The atmosphere is pretty cool, and their menu was pretty easy to get thru.   My wife had the custard and she said that it was great! One gripe is that they do not offer a No Sugar Added alternative.  I would definitely go back!

This taco bell rocks. I've never had any major issues, other than the typical "Dammit no sauce" but still this franchise is usually very good and precise. Widdly Scuds can definitely be obtained here.

I have been to this place twice and I doubt I will ever return. Beer prices are outstanding, but their calzones are horrible.  The sauce tasted like pico de gallo, by far the worse calzones I have ever had. The wife had the Stromboli and she said that her's was just as bad. I would recommend this place just for the cheap beer but stay away from those 2 items.

When i first heard of this place i was a little disturbed by the name, but once i got the nerve to go inside  i was impressed. They have yummy pancakes. They are diabetic friendly and they offer Sugar Free Maple Syrup. I didn't see many crackers around, but they do offer soup, so they might have them in the back. They also have a store area where they sell interesting knick-knacks and other strange items. I would recommend this place.

The first time I walked into this store I almost orgasmed. This place is the mecca of alcohol and cigars! Very well stocked, they carry almost everything Including some rare liquors and the staff there is soo helpful. The prices are amazing and you can pick and choose your own six pack, so if your feeling adventurous this is the place for you!

It's a chain movie theater. You can't really add much to that, other than this location is always clean, staff is courteous and helpful. When there are problems with other patrons (talking, cell phones, etc) they have always addressed the issue and ensured we left happy.

OHH NOEZ I HAZ TO MAKE MY OWN KOFEE! was my first impression after walking into this Dunkin Donuts location. But once i got over it i actually loved the idea, that i can have my favorite coffee my way.   My only complaint is the parking situation, it sucks... but that's Mill avenue for you!

Walked in here on a Saturday evening and I was really disappointed. The place was a mess, it was over crowded and the music was horrible. I had really been looking forward to coming here and I was sadly disappointed.

HOLY HELL! NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL A MOTHERF***ING SAMMICH!  I had been hearing from my best bud, that there's this place in Tucson called Jimmy John's that has awesome sammiches.  We'll lo and behold they opened one here in Tempe and by the way my friend kept describing the subs I decided to finally go and get one for lunch. I got a Turkey Tom and wow, that freaking sammich was awesome! The subs are long and soft, and they're full of yumminess. The bread is tasty and it tastes like bread. Turkey tasted like Meat. It was like there was a party in mouth and everyone came! I would definitely recommend it.

This smoke shop is really small, but very well stocked. The staff is really friendly. This is a place i would not recommend bringing children (Due to the porn on the walls), but all your tobacco needs can be satisfied here. I knocked down a star due to them charging a convenience fee on debit card transactions.

Absolutely love this hookah lounge. The atmosphere is very chill, the staff is really friendly and the prices are awesome. Pool tables are available and this place is 18+ so you young wiper snappers can come here and enjoy some hookah with friends. The place is a bit smoky, but what do you expect. The front counter carries snacks and other smoking accessories. Try the Skittles Flavor!

Wow,  this place is amazingly tasty and affordable!  Came into this place shortly after it opened and i was blown away by the tastiness of their food. The Spam Misubi is tasty and well prepared. The macaroni salad is soo awesome it'll make you say "Boom goes the dynamite!"   The inside is very plainly decorated but that doesn't matter when your food tastes that good. Try it, you'll be glad you did.

I really enjoy this gym. The facilities are extremely clean and well maintained. The Equipment  is in outstanding condition and well serviced. The staff is courteous and the gym has a shower too. They offer classes, if you're into that kind of thing.   The prices are fair.

Those golden wings! They taste like they were forged by Chuck Norris! Their golden wings are damn right breath taking.  The wife and I enjoy going there sometimes because I enjoy their burgers too. I usually order the Thousand Island burger, add avocado, mushrooms and bacon. The fries...they aiight, yo. But all in all, the burger is awesome.  The beer here is also really cheap, so that just makes it extra awesome. Furthermore, my single friend (who is kinda weird) said that the girls are kinda hot in there. So that's another plus.
