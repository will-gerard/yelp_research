Horrible customer service.  The right hand doesn't left doing.  I just wish they would have some way to compensate someone for lost time or mishandled calls.    Their service is included in my rent so I have no control over who I get to choice for an ISP however when I do, they will not be my ISP.    I have little to nothing good to say about them as my experience with them in Arizona has been terrible.    They had to drop a new line for service however they left me hanging without service for over 2 weeks and I work out of my home.  All they could say was, "we're sorry".  well that's not good enough for me which is the reason I wrote this.    Thank you for listening to me complain.  I honestly will not be using them for service in the future.

I love Fresh and Easy!  After returning from a trip to Iowa, I appreciated them even more!  I enjoy their product mix, people,  product quality and prices!    This is my store of choice!  :)

Great burgers and menu offerings.  You would expect to get a good burger with a name like that and you do.  The sweet potato fries, Frenched fried onions, and Salmon Salad are very good too.    The decor, location, and menu are restaurant alternative for the area.    The menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isn't an issue.    I do recommend to restaurant to others.

Great space, location, offerings, and feel.  I stopped in to meet a friend and to see the place and really liked what I seen.  Beautifully decorated, great concept  with diverse product mix.  It's all good.    They are working with local businesses to sell local products as well which is nice to see.  I did try the Tortilla soup and thought it was very tasty and if I wasn't in such a hurry and it was a different time of day, I would have had something more to eat than that as the placed smelt soo good.    Love the location and that area needed something like this.  Like the open air feeling of it combined with the general look.  I'll be back for sure!
