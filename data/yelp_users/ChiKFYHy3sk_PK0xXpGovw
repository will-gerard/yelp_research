The Heard Museum is amazing.    I've only been here once, during one of their free attendance days.    Although there are some kid-oriented exhibits, teens and adults will get the most out of this museum.  The Kachina exhibit is wonderful.  All of the art is breath-taking.  The Indian school exhibit is heart-breaking.  I highly recommend going to this museum at least once, especially if you live in AZ.

My hatred for this walmart burns with the fire of a thousand suns.   The ONLY saving grace of this craphole is that they carry quite a bit more inventory than some of the other walmarts.  There are always employees everywhere but where you need them.  There's a multitude of them milling about the store, except in the paint section, the camping/ammo section, the cash registers...you get the drift.  And, while my expectations aren't terribly high as it's a Walmart, holy white/black/brown/olive trash Batman!  They should just go ahead and put in a meth section and make a few extra bucks.  It's dirty, it smells, the customer service is nonexistent, and you have to wade through the tweakers, but it's cheap and they have a lot of stuff.

Dragon Palace has become our go-to place when the family is itching for some Americanized Chinese food.    Like other Yelpers have noted, it's tucked away in a very diverse strip mall.  Yes, it's slightly ghetto, but I live down the street so I'm not scurred.  The servers are *very* attentive, almost aggressively so (not necessarily in a bad way).  They get the food to the table quickly, and I've never had anything that wasn't good.  The banana/honey wontons are amazing!    A bonus is that my picky eater always finds something that she likes here and she finds herself trying things she wouldn't normally try.

This is one of the best museums in the Phoenix area!  I love bringing my kids here, and they enjoy going.  The admission price is very reasonable, and they have free days once a month.  Whether you pay full price or get in for free, it's definitely worth your time.  The Museum is spread out enough that even if there are a lot of people there that day, you don't feel crowded and can still see all of the exhibits and take your time.  It has a plethora of AZ history, from dinos to geology to Native people to Spanish settlers to movies.  Seriously, go visit this gem tucked in the middle of Mesa.

For full disclosure's sake, I work here.  I can, however, be unbiased since I don't work for the Faire itself.  The best deal is to take advantage of the 2-for-1 tickets that take place on opening weekend and President's Day Monday.  Be warned: everyone else is doing the same thing and it is CROWDED on those days.  Presidents Day can be particularly bad.  To get your day's worth, I recommend going on those days where it looks like it's going to rain.  People generally stay away, so it's not nearly as crowded.  You get walking space, shorter food and drink lines, and better access to shows.  It's better to go in the beginning of the run as opposed to the later weekends.  It can get hot those last weekends in March.  Food is pricey, just like any other outdoor venue.  It's actually a better deal than the State Faire (I price-checked, so I know).  Your best value is to get a bread bowl and get the large soda ($3 for a large cup.  Ask them to go easy on the ice).  The food is tasty and filling.    If you don't want to buy the food, invest in a good cooler.  Fill it with food and ice and put it in your trunk.  Go out and eat lunch. Make sure you get your hand stamped first so you can get back in.  You can't bring food and drinks in.  You are allowed to bring water; plain, unflavored water.  Please don't give the front gate ticket-takers a hard time about it.  They're nice people who don't make the rules.  They do check bags.  Also, unless it's a service animal, leave the pets at home!  Only service animals are allowed into the Faire.  They won't let you bring in your puppy, kitten, cat, dog, iguana, macaw, alligator, wooly mammoth, etc.  There is a rudimentary kennel where you can keep your pet.  Yes, the birds of prey will find your chihuahua puppy to be a tasty treat.  Leave it at home.    There is a rental shop where you can rent electric scooters (like rascals, not razors), wheelchairs, strollers, and wagons.  They are first come, first served.  They don't take reservations, and have a limited number of electric carts.  Make sure you get there first thing if you need one.  Also, keep in mind that there is a weight limit on the electric scooters:  300 pounds.  If you're over that amount, they can't rent to you.  That having been said, the Faire site is 30 acres of walking.  There is a decent amount of seating, and not a lot of shade (we're in the desert after all).  Little ones will need lots of breaks and drinks.  Make sure you're drinking the occasional water to help soak up some of that beer.  Speaking of drinking, there are both porta-potties and flushies.  If you can hold it, wait for the flushies.    The shows are wonderful!  There is belly dancing, and juggling, and acrobatics, and comedy, and mystery, and intrigue!  Some of my personal favorites are  Hey Nunnie Nunnie!, Barely Balanced, Zilch the Torysteller, The Wild Men, Three Guys and a Bunch of Drums, Wine and Alchemy, the Birds of Prey, and probably others that I'm forgetting.    Ded Bob is a big draw, as are the Tortuga Twins.  Get to those shows early because it can be standing room only some days.  There is an opening gate show that begins at about 9:30.  There is also a closing gate show that starts between 5:30 and 5:45.    There is a variety of shops from food to clothing to house tchotchkes to artwork to toys to candles.  You will find something that you want.   There are rides for the kids.  Some are free, some cost extra money. The butterfly carousel is free and is great for toddlers to about 5 year-olds.  The other rides are about $2 (might be more, I don't know); the bungy jump is about $6, and there are camel and elephant rides; I think they're $5.  There is also a Dungeon Museum.  It think it's $2 to get in.  It's disturbing and fun.  I'd recommend it for 10 years and up, maybe going a little younger if your kid doesn't scare easily.   I highly recommend dropping in on hot days because it's air conditioned.   There's also a Storybook Museum.  I think this is also $2.  This is where you want to take your little princesses and princes.  There are little dioramas set up with fairy tale stories.  It's cute.  There is a petting zoo that is FREE!  You can have a little sit-down and pet some chicks and baby ducks, and there are usually some border collie pups with their moms.  Visit the big hairy cow!  I almost forgot the joust!  You have to see at least one of the jousts throughout the day; there are 3 so choose wisely.  I think that's everything.   You don't have to go in costume, but it's much more fun that way!

This aquarium is ok.  I've definitely been to bigger and better ones.  The fact that it's attached to a mall is interesting, but ultimately a big pain in the butt because you not only have to navigate aquarium traffic, but also mall traffic.  On top of that, AZ Mills is a mess.  Sea Life feels like what it is: a privately-owned aquarium franchise that uses mall space.  I probably wouldn't have gone if I didn't have the 2-for-$20 groupon, since the admission is pricey.  The aquarium itself is small and crowded.  There are also "box" seats seemingly randomly strewn throughout, with which my shins are very well acquainted.  They do have a nice sting ray exhibit, with some sharks here & there.  The 360 degree walk-through was nice, but small.  The jellyfish exhibit was a very small tank.  The crustacean room was interesting.  The seahorse exhibit was great (then again, I love seahorses so I'm pretty forgiving).  It felt like I could have seen the majority of these fish in the Rainforest Cafe in the same mall, or even at a tropical fish store.  There are a lot of kids working there.  This isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't make me feel confident in their marine biology experience.    I left feeling underwhelmed and a bit annoyed.  Unless I get free tickets, I probably won't be going back.

This place is a little dive-y, and the hours are very Apache-Junction (they close at 9:00 on a Saturday?!), but the food is excellent and they deal with the seasonal crowds that enter AJ in January through April.  The Southwestern Burrito (I think that's what it's called, the one with cactus in it) is huge and tasty.  The cornbread is heavenly.  The margaritas are great.
