What can I say?  I just can NOT be disappointed with this restaurant!  We've been going for over 15 years, have gone for New Years, birthdays, anniversaries and countless other special occasions and they've never dropped the ball. Not once!    The view?...Even if you're in a miserable mood this amazing mountain top floor-to-ceiling panoramic view will make you feel like all the stars in the sky are set out over the valley just for you.  It is incredibly relaxing, breathtaking, romantic and makes for beautiful pictures!   The food....well, I must be honest, I'm not sure how the menu fares as we don't even read it...we've only ever ordered the chef tasting menu, but I've never been let down. In fact, I get so excited when we make reservations it's all I think about for days. They do ask if you have food allergies, but be warned, if you're not up for trying new foods or eating favorites in creative, inventive, non-traditional combinations this might be too much of an adventure for you:) That being said, I suggest "Live a little", try new things and allow this artist of a chef to take you on a flavor ride.  He will convert you to allow someone else to take the wheel.  The beauty of the plates, the flavors and combinations are always memorable...  This particular evening we started with pan seared foie gras on top of French toast with a chestnut smear and huckleberry jam.   Our second course was a light and crunchy breaded soft shell crab with a frisée salad tossed in lemon vinaigrette and dotted with fried slivers of jalapeños.    Course 3 was an impeccable pan seared diver sea scallop atop a lobster Parmesan risotto cake served with lobster knuckles, caramelized shallots and (I believe) rapini.  4th course was pistachio crusted rack of lamb with natural lamb jus reduction over a celery root purée and, spinach and roasted chanterelle mushrooms.   Dessert was a 4 piece sampler per couple.  1.) a citrus bread pudding (mandarin ?) 2.) a s'more type layered chocolate and marshmallow cake 3.) traditional cream brûlée with berries 4.) an amazing combination of peanut butter, chocolate and banana...don't know what it was, but we almost fought over it and it was gone too quickly to break it down, but if you get a choice (as sometimes we have been offered during the tasting) get the peanut butter, banana & chocolate dessert...all of us agreed!     The wine...well, they have many many many choices and I'm sure you can find your favorite, but why not let your server/sommelier make a pairing to the chef's menu?  I've experienced many wines I might not have bothered to try, and, as an interesting twist, several didn't care for when poured, but fell in LOVE with when the course pairing arrived. What a gift they have to elevate both the food and the wine!  I wish I had written down the wines from this evening, but my phone was not charged, so I am going without pics and from memory (which got fuzzier following 4 glasses of wine;)). Many of the food courses had extra oils, drizzles and smears as well that made for unctuous bites, but again I apologize for the lack of "notes" taken.  First was a sweeter round white from France, second was a crisp, fruity (pear/Apple) white akin to a Pinot Grigio from Italy, third was a Chardonnay from California and fourth was a cotes de rhone (blend of Grenache/Syrah). Again, I apologize for no names.   The service...I've always felt service is at LEAST 1/2 of your dining experience. I cannot say enough about the atmosphere created here. They make you feel special without being stuffy. We joke around with the staff and are always made to feel comfortable.   If you ever get the chance to splurge on a special meal, I HIGHLY recommend this as an all around amazing experience.   Compliments to the chef and the entire staff at Different Pointe of view...I look forward to the next time I'm lucky enough to return!

Love this airport!  Clean, friendly, plenty of options and not too much walking to gates,  though I like to walk the halls if I'm waiting. Bathrooms are kept clean, some healthy food choices, local gifts etc.  I just wish I could move it closer to home...and teach people how to merge especially with the construction going on right now-lol!

Great NY style pizza and chicken wings are great too!  Being from NY, that is important to find this far west:). Ray's is aways our "go to" place for parties!  They guys are helpful and friendly. Once over the years we had a mistake and they were quick to make it right.  I just stopped in and grabbed some clean pizza boxes for our school's class project... Great customer service!  I'm proud to advertise during our school's Showcase night:)

This was my first time back here since early 2000's and I must say I was impressed!  I loved the fact it felt new. Everything was super clean from the lobby to the bathrooms to the theater itself. The concessions were good, clean and what you expect to pay at a theater. The staff was friendly, neat/clean and efficient. I dinged one star for "ropes" blocking most of the hallway outside the bathrooms not sure why they were there on Thursday night and taking up so much space. And the seats in the theater (#7 anyhow) were cheap. They were narrow, and not super comfortable to "recline" in given theaters now have sofa chair-like recliners and servers with a full dinner menu, a little cushier seat would be an expected feature. That being said, I will return.

The people here are incredible. So friendly, helpful and efficient.   I come here almost weekly (not that I always remember to check in-lol).  They have an awesome case sale program DAILY. I've also been coming on Fridays for the pre-order $20 combo boxes thru Garcia family fruit of happiness (see Facebook to get in on these deals)!

Ok, well that was a hot mess!  So, there were only 4 cars but it took forever...   Our turn at the drive thru  "I'll take 2 popcorn chicken".  "There is no popcorn chicken the rest of the night."   "Ok, I'll need a second to rethink our order"...kids agree on chicken tenders, "ok, we're ready- we'll take two chicken tender combos boxes with root beer"  "we are out of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and root beer ".  Really?!...Ok..."well do you have the water?" "  Yes."  "Ok 2 waters, please"  up at the window (20 minutes later?!) I am given 2 cups of ice water..."excuse me, is there a reason we didn't get the dysani? " "Oh, you wanted bottled water?  Yes, we got the combo...so I paid for a drink.  Do you want a soda?  No? "We are out of bottled water "  but I specifically asked you about it?  I just heard you ask about water, not bottled water... Obviously if I ask " if you have the water" I'm not asking like I think the plumbing is broken?!? Am I being punked? Then someone magically dug out 2 bottles of Aquafina "from the back" Geez! Food was good, served it purpose, what you'd expect, and hot but untimely- even for a Friday night drive thru. 2 stars were for the curt service including lack of apology... for anything.  Won't be back to this location.

Excellent service, clean cute restaurant with amazing food. The owner makes sure everything is made fresh daily. She worked for Wolfgang Puck for 10 years and her quality rivals anything you'll eat on the strip.   This little unassuming gem in a strip plaza is worth a stop. The corn purée saffron soup was quite good as were both entrees we had for lunch. The daily special of grilled swordfish was tenter, juicy and very flavorful. The fresh pineapple salsa was a beautiful acidic compliment to the fish and the grilled scallop salad had elements with amazing flair and texture.  This is a definite repeat. If I had to give one ding it would be the hibiscus tea...even after watering down it was too strong, but it could be me since it's a strong flavor to begin with... Thank you table 34 for a surprising treat at a very reasonable price given the quality!  See when we're back in town!

Clean, quiet, spacious and bright.  Not a bad in between place to wait. Returned rental early and hung out for a bit before heading back to airport to go home.

Wow!  A first class establishment!  The staff is above and beyond what you expect at the dentist. My first visit I was given a full tour of the office which made me very comfortable.  I sat down with Dr. Burns in his office and just got to know him-what a genuinely nice person!  They offer cutting edge technology including crowns and inlays IN office (no shipping out to a lab) and laser cleaning to avoid unnecessary bacteria.  They communicate via headsets, so they are super efficient and you're never waiting at the counter or for paperwork etc because the are ready ahead of your arrival...I feel they've thought of everything. They offer Chapstick (my kids always steal it b/c it's my family's favorite) and xylitol suckers along with water, coffee, juices and snacks in the waiting room. They offer your choice of music, laughing gas, blankets, pillows etc in the room and pause often to check how you're doing.  I highly recommend this office for everyone, bust especially if you aren't comfortable going to the dentist...they will change your mind!

What a truly great experience! Daniel T was genuinely pleasant and very attentive without being intrusive; a rare and desirable trait among servers in my opinion!  The food was timely and quite good. From ribs to pizzas and salads to weekend brunch, there was something to please everyone!

Convenient, fast turn around time, friendly staff and very reasonable prices-only $2.50 per item of clothing (of course comforters and pillows, etc are more).   50 cents extra and you can have items folded for travel -BONUS!

So I've been here many times, but today, I popped in for hot chocolate. As I was looking around the counter through the MANY choices, I turned the corner to be asked "Would you like a free Iced coffee?"   Why, YES!  Yes, I would!  They had just finished installing an iced coffee maker and wanted a customer to sample it (they made sure I grabbed the large) and showed me where everything was.  I've always been impressed with their friendliness and helpfulness at this location.  It was not necessary, and they very well could have tried it themselves, but once again, they've done right by the customer...and made my day:)

They were nice enough, but after waiting 45 minutes to fix a cracked screen I was given a card for insurance and told to follow instructions or have to go to Apple Store /repair shop...?!??!  Couldn't the person who checked me in have done that?  Thanks for wasting my time...grrrrrr.

Weird little drive thru, but I don't have to get out of my car!  It's everything I expect from DD, great coffee & fast service with a smile. ***If going west or south from here, you need to leave this huge shopping complex at a light:/ Loses a star for being inconvenient to get in & out of

I'm so grateful to have a DD location relatively near by with a drive thru!  This is my favorite coffee of all time...it gets me up in the morning:) They have great deals if you sign up for their rewards card!  Free medium hot or iced coffee on Mondays after a Cardinals win (I assume other teams/locations offer an equivalent deal). They also have discounts on kcups (2/$14.99), free coffee every 300pts and all kinds of specials to get extra points (try new menu item, come in 3x's in the next 2 weeks, etc).  I've almost always got multiple free coffees on my account. I even have the app on my phone, so it reloads every Monday, so I get rewards offers, track points and pay right from my phone at the drive in window (they scan it in my hand). I've had an occasional mishap on an order, but they've always been gracious about fixing it.   Food serves its purpose, not the homemade donuts of a non-chain, and the sandwiches are what you'd expect. The workers at window are polite and efficient.  UPDATE: They've been sliding downhill. Fast. This month I've gone multiple times when they didn't have large or xl cups! Really? Lots of items unavailable, plus the food is NOT good, and problems/mistakes are WAY too frequent to be acceptable. I'll continue the drive thru for my coffee occasionally ONLY b/c of my love of DD coffee & the convenience, but they won't get any additional business from me until they get their act together.  For the gas I use getting here, I will take my business to a closer location...management needs to step it up!

What a really nice and, above all, honest guy!  Dwaine Ames Durham is super friendly and hard working. I planned to get carpet & tile (whole house) done, but after he walked thru told me that I really don't need the tile done-it is in excellent condition!  He could've made an extra $400 on me (***lots of tile), but saved me tons instead!  He included closets (walk in) in room cost for carpet and got out all our stains. I was impressed!  He told me $250 for carpet over the phone (I estimated walk in as separate) and $.30/for tile. After requesting that he still add at least the bathroom tiles he only charged me $235 total?!?!  That is great customer service.  I trust him and would recommend him to anyone looking to get their floors cleaned!  Gave him $250 anyhow for his honesty!  Thanks, Ames!

Decent little spot with good coffee, good selection. Breakfast sammys were good but nothing amazing. Service was slow. I was left a but disappointed but love supporting local businesses, so I'll try again another day.

Not sure of normal experience since there was only one waitress for entire sports book, but there were about 15-20 of us and after 30 minutes she didn't even acknowledge us.  I flagged her down and asked for a beer and she smiled and nodded her head....I walked next door while DH watched his game and ordered food from the take out pizza place and was quoted 25 minutes.  30 minutes later... I got my food and was eating and looking for our waitress who had not brought my drink nor was anywhere to be found. At this point it was getting much fuller and I assumed she was out getting beverages. She returned with an empty tray, removed some empty wine glasses from a couple leaving and walked back out.  Returned 5 minutes later with another empty tray and never spoke to anyone. She made eye contact from across the room and hurried out, so I assumed she realized she forgot and went to grab my drink.  Nope.  Another few minutes passed and now almost done with my meal, I decided to go up to the bar and get my own beer...  They need more staff or at least some kick ass waitress who is willing to offer service or hustle...at the very least.  She could've been making a killing, especially not having to share with any other servers... Really disappointed. Worst service ever in Vegas- the town that caters to your every whim...just not in Aria's sports book today:/

Great staff. Everyone is friendly and I love how fast they work!  Kim is amazing with artwork & designs and my mom & hubby love Rosie for a pedi.  Take the kids! $25 for mani/pedi with design...SO worth it!

Well, I must not get it!  With all the raving I must have had high expectations?  The owner was friendly, but asked and reasked my order several times. I was one of the first and only customers in there. So I ordered the bean tostada and green chili beef chimichanga: The toastada was super crispy (impressive for take out) but didn't realize tomatoes are extra:/ The "salsa" sauce was good, it tasted fresh and had heat but wasn't super hot.  However the beans were like soup...dripping off the tostada and puréed to have no bean texture!? Personal preference?   The green chili chimi was huge and with the bean(soup) & rice in the container it was super full. The rice was good and the spice of the green chili sauce was spicy and delicious, however the chimi wasn't fried?!  Or at least it wasn't fried well...it was pale and pasty without the crunchy bits that make a chimi awesome. I was particularly disappointed as the chimi is more expensive. Also if it is a beef chimi, I expect beef of which there was barely any...pics show what was inside... Not a good first impression. I spent over $24 and won't even eat it.  Bummer.

A must stop for our whole family when visiting he Tanger outlets. They have all kinds of yummy options and it's great snack food while shopping.   Make sure to stop by the mall office before hand to get the coupon booklet (free for military or AAA member with proof -bring your card!) 2 for 1 @ Wetzel's Pretzels ***coupon is for pretzels only, not bites, hot dogs, etc.   They have great lemonade and frozen lemonade along with strawberry flavored. ***beware, when the mall is busy, so are they!

4 & 3/4  Best west valley Thai so far!  My missing star is really about personal preference. I started eating Thai food at a restaurant that used fresh veggies from the local farmers market so every dish was stuffed full of thin sliced veggies: carrots, zucchini, squash, sugar snap peas etc adding a freshness and color where it seems most everywhere else uses traditional frozen veggies or  in this case fresh veggies cut like frozen:/ I'm not saying our meal was not delicious because it WAS (4 3/4 stars!!!) and the staff couldn't have been friendlier, kinder or more attentive. DEFINITE REPEAT WHEN OVER HERE! Full belly and leftovers to boot:)

Ok, so I finally got here!  I stopped in once to check it out when they first opened, and they had more selection, like sandwiches and lunch options which is no longer the case. Every time I have been at the theater or stopped in it has been like a ghost town.  It was disappointing because they are super friendly and have some good product, but I fear location (not the easiest plaza to pop in & out of especially to just grab pastries) might do them in.  Also the signage is down and it is located off the street with no signage near the road. Just not the kind of thing you grab before or after a movie... So after chatting up the lovely lady at the counter I discovered that the reason they paired down the menu was lack of business:/ I decided on an apple fritter (REALLY GOOD) it was very moist, with a sweet crispy exterior and chunks of apples (not just hints of apple sauce) with a perfect cinnamon balancemmmmm... I'll be saving my blueberry jelly (lemon/raspberry also available) donut for later;) Please try this place out...it's worth saving...we need good options in our community

Sad.  I don't want to give a bad review, but I have to be honest and I feel I was mislead by all the reviews I read on this place.   First impression I wanted to run back out and so did my husband, but given the rave reviews I thought we should stick it out.   The "decor" (if you could call it that) was cold, unwelcoming and very confusing. The front booths had no color and checkerboard tablecloths like a diner/pizza joint, while the back was mostly tables with green walls and tons of junk on display. The back wall had a large ladder leaning against a door which lead me to hope they were remodeling the new location. The ceiling "tiles" had paint missing and weird pieces of red fabric over the lights along with red glass pendant lights. The front counter (bakery type display) was enormous but completely empty. Hmmm  So we sat down and the girl brought us menus. The tables around us were dirt with dirty dishes/food and remained that way for our meal. The menu seemed promising with lots of choices Athenian, Greek, Italian  (perhaps too many?).   I started with lemon chicken soup ($3.45) that tasted canned (the chicken had the consistency of Campbell's chicken noodle soup). We asked the server for his recommendation. He said he likes the "chicken pita"...so, I asked which one?  He didn't know. What is in it? He did not know... OK... So we went with the Kalamata ($8.95) as that was what I was leaning towards. We also ordered the $10.95 Gyro Burger, medium...sounds interesting.   The salad was "ok", and the chicken pita tasted "spongy like microwaved from frozen" according to my husband and the tzatziki sauce was watery and bland. The burger had a "square" corners on it and was chewy like only frozen beef can feel. It was also a distinct "well done", however thank goodness it wasn't undercooked as my hubby & I were sick the rest of the day.    At the end of our meal a very sweaty dirty man with long greasy hair (Mike?) came out to ask how everything was...really?    Servers were nice and attentive (1 star), but we won't be going back. Very disappointed as I LOVE Greek food and we really need some variety around here.

Sooooo excited for a JJ in Surprise!  The place was super clean and the staff VERY friendly. We all loved our smoothies-fresh and flavorful. I dinged one star b/c it smelled like bleach when I walked in (though it was close to closing on a week night, so they probably just got started cleaning/closing up early) and they REALLY need a location with a drive thru ESPECIALLY in AZ!  I know this is not their normal model, but the competition has a drive thru and the convenience factor will take away business...  Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about that now, except go online or get the app and preorder so you can just run in, grab your order, and go:)
