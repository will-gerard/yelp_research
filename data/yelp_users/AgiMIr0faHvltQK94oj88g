This place is great. Always friendly and welcoming. They offer free wine, snacks, water, coffee, etc. to anyone getting a service. If you are getting your hair done they offer free hand  and scalp massages.  Free neck trims for men and free bang trims for the ladies( I'm guessing as long as you have already had a service done with them).  Always a great turn out when I leave this place.

Food ok, service was really bad. The waitress was sweet but forgot about us multiple times. We had to continue to remind her about our orders. I do not like writing bad reviews but it was just a long wait for nothing special...

I am originally from Utah and I am a Cafe Rio LOVER! When I found out there would be a cafe rio right around the corner from my house here in Avondale, I think I almost jumped out of my chair.  When I first went to this restaurant I was somewhat disappointed though.  When I ordered my salad they forgot most of the items, but put extremely large amounts of the items they remembered on it.  I chocked this up for "this place is new and they are still learning the "cafe rio" ways".  I went back again, and I ordered the tortilla soup.  When I got home, I found out they only put chicken and broth in the soup.  I again just chocked it up to it being so new.    I go back because I LOVE THE FOOD, but this particular Cafe Rio is so inconsistent with their knowledge and their attitude towards everyone.  The Cafe Rio downtown Phoenix, Mesa and all of the Cafe Rio's that I have been to in Utah are EXTREMELY friendly and always aware of the menu, at this Cafe Rio, no one can ever remember what is on the menu or what size items are supposed to come in.    Today I went back, again because I LOVE the food and I want to keep giving this place another chance, but when I walked up to the front like I usually do, the lady behind the glass grabbed a tray and just stared at my sister and I.  Then after staring for a moment or two, stated "Can I help you"... we informed her we would like the kids casadilla with chicken.  On the menu it says "choice of beans or rice  and comes with chips and drink."  When she asked us "beans and rice?" we said yes please.  Then towards the end, we asked why we didn't get chips, the cashier said "you got beans and rice".  We then said well we are confused because it comes with chips and a drink. The lady at the front said "no, you can pick 2 of the 3 items."  When we told her we were confused because that is not how it is written on the menu she just stated our total again. I don't care about what is in the kids meal, but the menu is inconsistent with what they tell us at the beginning.    I love this food, except when it is prepared by the people at this particular venue.   -Staff never knows the menu -Staff rarely friendly -Food never has accurate ingredients (i.e wrong cheese, no pico, only chicken and broth in the tortilla soup etc.) -Poor amounts of items (too much dressing, too little chips, not enough cheese, etc.)   I will continue to go to Cafe Rio, but I will make the drive to Phoenix and Mesa because this particular venue is depressing and makes all of the other Cafe Rio's look bad.

This place is awesome. Super fun and cute atmosphere and setting. Food is great and service is friendly. Have only tried breakfast  here but would definitely come back.  The only thing I would say is bad is that the board for the menu is really hard to read, the menu is scribbles on the board so it makes it difficult to see exactly what is on the menu. And the colors for the lunch menu you can't really read.  Other wise this place is great.
