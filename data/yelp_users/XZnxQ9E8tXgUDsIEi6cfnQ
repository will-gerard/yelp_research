DO NOT MOVE HERE!!! My sister, her husband, and their 3 young daughters are incredibly sick from what is most likely a MOLD INFESTATION. Medical treatment may be easier if the apartment would release the test result. COMPLETELY UNACCOUNTABLE! Not to mention the state of the apartment when they first moved in was UNACCEPTABLE AND HORRENDOUS!!! It was their first experience moving to and living in an apartment. WARNING!!!!: This apartment complex will be nice to you and show you a nice apartment with decent appliances and give you a DUMP along with treat you like GARBAGE!!! The carpet was detached from the walls and entry way, there was FILTH and DUST everywhere, the washer and dryer were filthy and from last century, all the mirrors are scratched to hell, blinds dented, AND NOT TO MENTION the refrigerator was cracked and dented and looked liked it was thrown down a staircase. Oh let's not forget how humid the apartment is. FOR YOUR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH AND SANITY DO NOT LIVE HERE!

Stopped in for a fast breakfast to go. Service was very friendly and very fast! Blueberry bagel was very good and the strawberry almond cream cheese is a must!

POLLO FUNDIDO!!! Always delicious and shareable. The hot salsa and bandito burros are amazing too. Valle Luna has a great happy hour with a big selection to choose from. Food is great so expect it to be busy certain nights. They have an amazing loyal staff. I love to support local business and valley Luna is one of my favorite places to go for Mexican food.

Let me start by saying this is my grocery store I use and have used for the past 10 years. I know where everything is, staff is generally nice and helpful.  However I've had a couple problems with stupid rules that seem to only apply to me, maybe it's being heavily tattooed idk.  There was a problem for a long time (until I was able to get an AZ ID) where I couldn't purchase cigarettes or alcohol because I had just moved back to Arizona and had an out of state ID. If the damn airport security is going to let me on a plane with that ID I dont understand the stick in frys ass about it.  Next, today, I was told I had to walk to the bank across the lot at 5 months pregnant and walk back with a large amount of cash. My mother is disabled and I run errands for her weekly using her debit card and PIN. I've used her card for the 10 years I've been shopping at this location, but since they were having yet another issue with the chip reader the cashier helped me with the card, and took the time to examine the picture then realizing it wasn't me, went to customer service having another gentlemen telling me I can't use it to purchase the over $200 cart of groceries already bagged and ready to go.  So Frys...you better start checking everyones card and IDs even when they have a PIN to make sure they match if you're going to send a pregnant woman to the bank using the same card and PIN she would've used at your store. God forbid I have my boyfriends card and PIN trying to get groceries for out own family.  Time to take my business to Safeway.

One of the better sushi spots in the north west valley. The quality and taste are consistent along with the service. I love the green tea and recommend the tempura salmon roll, spicy tuna, and Vegas roll...just a couple of my favorites

Came here June 8th for a family members birthday. I wasn't impressed at all, I've worked in the service industry for over 6 years and the lack of service for what you pay here is astonishing. Not only was service an issue but the restrooms were dirty and smelled of urine with dirt caked around the edges of the walls. I was also surprised at the music choice which didn't fit the ambience at all. I'd like to assume flemings considers themselves upscale due to the prices on the menu, but there were specific events that occurred that will not have me coming back. First, there were many people tending to our table but our drinks seemed to remain empty for long periods of time. Second, with our large party we received 1 complimentary bread and had to continuously request more (I understand it is complimentary, but enough should be given for the size of the party, especially when paying $30-$50 a plate), Third, one of the entrees was served with completely raw shrimp. Last, something that bothered me terribly, we asked a man that had been to our table several times what one of the sauces was and his reply was "I don't know", without offering to go find out or send our server to inform us he left us with "I don't know". This to me is completely unacceptable especially at a "fine dining" establishment. I hope Flemings can train their employees better in customer service to avoid losing anymore business.

Best service I've received in a very long time! This was my first time here. I called and placed an order to go with Carmine. He was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. When I walked into the restaurant and requested my order I was greeted by name. Nothing makes you feel more valued as a guest than being remembered!!! The food is delicious and everything plus more was remembered. I don't know how many times I've ordered food at other restaurants and something was forgot or left out. I am so happy and will be sure to return.
