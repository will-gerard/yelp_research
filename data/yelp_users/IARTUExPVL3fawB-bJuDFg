Great Italian food!   The 2-for-1 sangria was great just for checking in on Yelp, but the tortellinis in vodka sauce were the highlight of my experience. Delicious!  I'll definitely be back next time I'm near the Strip.

For our first tasting of celebrity chef's food, this wasn't a bad start!  We arrived to our 7:00pm reservation a little early, a little drunk, and very hungry! We stuck with the waters all dinner long, but did indulge with delicious salads, Italian food, and dessert. Our waitress was great and incredibly professional. I'd be back if a friend wanted to go, but would probably be more interested in seeing what Wolfgang's other restaurants on the Strip have to offer!

My friends and I stopped by for our last meal before driving home. The restaurant is located within the Tuscany Casino, a short drive off the strip. We were seated immediately which was nice considering we were hoping to beat some of the traffic.   It didn't matter though, because our service was terrible. Our waitress, Patty, was the worst server any of us had ever had. She didn't introduce herself for over 20 minutes and failed to provide any reason for being so inattentive. Our food came out another 30 minutes later and was all cold besides the country fried steak. Although cold, the food was pretty tasty.   Having already watched our neighboring table wait another 30 minutes for their check, we decided to skip the suspense and approach the hostess to pay. We would loved to have express our frustration to Patty herself, but she was too busy using her phone to check on us. Luckily we made sure her manager knew of our discontent.
