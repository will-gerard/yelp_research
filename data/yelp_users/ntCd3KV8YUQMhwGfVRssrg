One of only two places in the Phoenix area that can make an excellent Philly Cheesesteak like I get in Philly. Sandwiches are a good size & the price point is reasonable

I don't like writing negative reviews but honestly after my visit to Andys I have no idea what the 4 & 5 star ratings are all about...  First the good ~ my pedicure was good.  The lady actually listened to what I told her I wanted unlike the 2 nail techs that worked on me later.  The massage was nice and the color and design came out great.  The only downside to the pedicure was the "upselling" of services but most places do that so I don't consider that much of a negative.  My acrylics tho was a totally different story.  I told the tech I wanted french tips ~ what I ended up with were tips that were painted white which began chipping off in a matter of days.  Part of it was my fault as I was talking to my friend and not paying attention to what was being done.  Once I did notice I just didn't have the time for them to start over.   Even with an appointment I had to wait 30 minutes after before anyone could work on me.  The 2 techs that worked on my nails started having a rapid fire conversation in Vietnamese and took their time getting back to my nails.  The nails were way to thick ~ my term for the end result was hooker nails... ughhh!   Even tho the pedicure came out well at a good price I will not go back again.  I found a salon much closer with a very skilled nail tech who I will be going to from now on.  It costs more but then again you get what you pay for.

After months of reading about Cibo we finally decided we needed to find out for ourselves if the hype was real.  We arrived 5 minutes before they opened on a Friday evening and there was already a group and a couple ahead of us.  By the time the doors opened there were about 15 people behind us ~ mind you it was about 105 in Phoenix that evening...  We sat at the bar and was promptly greeted. We ordered the peach bellini which was an excellent cool off drink after being outside in the heat.  We ordered the Tartufata pie and added balsamic caramelized onions.  Just before our bellinis were finished our pie was placed in front of us.... I have to say it was a work of art.  With glasses of both the Cab Sav from Sicilla and a Primotivio we were set for the night.  The crust was excellent and the prosciutto was out of this world.  The onions with the white truffle oil was a wonderful finish.  We opted to share the crepe made of nutella and mascarpone which was a good decision.  Very rich and gooey there was no way either one of us would have been able to eat a whole one each.  That along with a glass of Moscati and I was in heaven :)  Excellent food, atmosphere and staff.  I can't wait to visit on either on a Tuesday or Wednesday when it's fresh pasta night!

I had my hair done last night for the 2nd time by Damien and I'll I can say is WOW my hair has never looked so good!!  I work awful hours but Damien takes me in for late appointments and takes his time with my hair.  I opted to go short last night which is something I haven't done in 10 years and I LOVE it.  My girlfriends haven't seen me yet but the guys in my office are falling all over themselves telling me how much they love my new style!  Damian YOU ROCK :)

I had my first visit today at the Downtown Salon and it was wonderful.    Freda removed the awful acrylics I had gotten at another "salon" and gave me one of the best manicures I've ever had.  She was extremely patient with the awful products that were on my nails that took awhile to remove.  The removal process was painless (for once) no drills (yes!) with great conversation :)  I love the shape and color ~ I have a return appointment for a pedicure next week that I am looking forward to

Just visited them for the first time today and all I can say is WOW!!  The people are gracious and the food had that kick that I love.  I ordered the loaded chili and garlic fries.  I could smell the garlic wafting up from the bag ~ my whole office now smells like garlic but it was wonderful!  The portions was enough for two so I know what I'll be having for dinner tonight.  Parking is somewhat of a challenge but it's well worth it.  I plan on returning on a regular basis.

I don't know why I attempt to go anywhere else but here. They are always friendly & happy to see you. The skills of all the nail techs are outstanding and they take their time & make sure you are happy with what they are doing. I moving to the east side of Phoenix but I will make the trip west for my mani/pedis

The Refuge Cafe is my go to Zen place before class. Depending on how my day went or which evening class I have I'll choose between an Arizona Sunset ice coffee with a tasty pastry or a cocktail with the turkey panini. Atmosphere is friendly & relaxed. I love sitting in one of the comfy arm chairs to sip my drink & finish up my class reading assignments

Sat at the bar for over 10 minutes completely ignored by the 3 employees working in that area.  My favorite was the one who was so busy looking at his phone and texting right next to me at the end of the bar.  Return I will not
