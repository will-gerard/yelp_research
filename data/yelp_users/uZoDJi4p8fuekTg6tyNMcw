Never written a review on yelp and this is my first. Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at an auto establishment. I go to the Fletchers off Lake Pleasant and Happy valley frequently. This is the first time I've gone to this Fletchers. I cannot express to you strongly enough to stay as far away it from this place as you can. Rude inconsiderate and unprofessional.

Great hole in the wall Mexican food place. Very good service.  Definitely worth a try.

Good food every weekend! Highly recommend the BLT or a hamburger at the grill.  Even have ESPN on while you eat.  That's my kind of Church!

Everything I've had here is amazing.   Breakfast - get the chicken fried steak! Burgers are great.   One of the only locally owned restaurants.  Owner is just an amazing man.   Miranda is one of the best servers there.
