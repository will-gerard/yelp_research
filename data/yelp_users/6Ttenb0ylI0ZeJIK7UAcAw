This place is amyazong! Best breakfast I've ever had! My go-to place anytime I'm heading up north for breakfast before the road trip - which brings me to my only complaint: WHY THE HELL AREN'T THERE ANY OF THESE PLACES IN CENTRAL PHOENIX?! Three locations all up on the edge of BFE? Come on now. Please. Come on down to central Phoenix. Share the awesome with everyone.

Have been there a couple times now. The food is awesome and authentic!   Service: Food takes quite a while to come out, even when the restaurant is almost empty, but it is apparent that they take care in preparing it. The waitress there wasn't very pleasant either time I dined there. She rolled her eyes at me when I ordered something from the traditional menu. I would have ordered out, but they don't have a website to look at a menu on, and they don't have paper menus that you can take with you. I forgot to take pictures of the menu the first time (but I did the second time, and will post them - you're welcome). I wish I had taken out (see next paragraph).   Ambiance: The place is dirty and plain. My friends and I were harassed by a brave cockroach the second time I went there. Will be taking out from now on. It is cool that they have live seafood tanks, so you can see how fresh the food is.   Food: Amazing and authentic. You can taste the care that they put into their sauces, and they know how to cook meat properly. Portions are generous! What I've had: -Mooshu Beef: Best I've ever had.  -Crab Rangoons: Meh. They definitely skimp on the filling; there's barely any, but an order comes with many won tons.  -Mongolian Beef: Awesome.  -Shark Fin Soup: Very good, but many Americans won't be used to the glass noodles. Also be aware that it is $3 per person, but they wouldn't allow me to get it just for myself (why restrict a soup like that? Idk. ) -Brisket Clay Pot (traditional): very little actual brisket meat. Mostly tendon and fat. The cabbage was awesome though, and great flavor.  -Egg Flower Soup: very good and traditional, and they don't add that yellow food coloring crap.  -Garlic Chicken: They definitely don't skimp on the garlic. It's great! -Crystal Shrimp: Really Really Good.   Prices: Very good. Everything on the menu is priced fairly, except for the shark fin soup (only because, as aforementioned, everyone at the table has to order it, even if only one person wants it, for $3 each for a small cup).   Will post the English menu now.

The food there is really good, and it's kept pretty clean, but... every time I shop there, I end up waiting 10-15 minutes in line at the registers because they only have 2-3 people working them. Not good. I've ended up going to farther places to shop because of the ungodly wait. Service, people, come on.

Great rolls! Portions were decent, and happy hour pricing was awesome. The server Brandon T. was very rude and was rushing us from beginning to end, and was seemingly the only employee who didn't thank us on the way out. Otherwise, it was a great experience.

Food was amazing! I got the chicken curry thali dinner, and I am so stuffed.   The 2nd time I went, I had the lunch buffet. It was awesome, as expected. I love the samosas and the tikka masala.   Good value for the quality and portion.  As I had read the server lady is quiet, but kind like a mother. She showed me where to find the ingredients in the store part, when I had asked about the fennel mix at the counter. So sweet.   this is a must have if you are in Phoenix and are a fan of Indian food!

Easily the best experience I've had at a vape shop. I just moved to the area, and now know where my go-to place is. Ben is awesome and helpful, and will set you up with what you need, and make you feel like a person -gasp- as opposed to a number, like many other vape shops. Plus, they have a flavor named from Skyrim. Um... Genius!

Now the hours are shortened EVEN MORE. 10-4 M-F. It's not like the postal service is an important institution that keeps this country running smoothly or anything. I'll never understand why post isn't 24 hours.
