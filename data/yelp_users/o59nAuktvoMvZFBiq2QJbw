This place is awful. The food is mediocre at best. If I wanted mediocre Mexican food with no service, I would've just went to Arriba's down the corner. I found the food to be saturated with lard and just overall, horrible. The only bright side to this place is that it's cheap. If price isn't an issue, I'd recommend Los Sombreros, right down the road on Northsight. For one, you get service, two the food is better, but it is more expensive.

Los Sombreros is a nice casual environment with high quality food. The food is absolutely delightful and unique. It is most definitely not your average Americanized Mexican food. The happy hour specials are exceptional enough to create a possible regular outing to Los Sombreros after work, but what really is absolutely amazing is the Lamb Adobo. It's a delight and brings forth ecstasy upon every bite. The staff is wonderful and friendly as well.

Wow, this place is incredible. Dom is incredibly friendly and informative. The juice collection is absolutely to die for. This place is the only place that carries 9 south juices in Scottsdale, which are top class. The RDA and Mod collection trumps that of more prestigious vape shops, and this place will blow up huge once it begins to get well known. Thanks Dom, this place is phenomenal.
