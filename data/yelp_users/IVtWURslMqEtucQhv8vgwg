I had to move my move date up so I only had a couple of days to find movers, I called a few companies with the same answer of "no openings" So when I called Conrad and he said yes right away I was a little hesitant on what kind of movers they would turn out to be or if they would even show up! lol  Come Tuesday morning 5 minutes before the scheduled time there they were pulling into the drive way, this crew blew me away, they were awesome Rudy and Renay were super efficient, quick and great customer service, real team, they double checked before we left the house to make sure everything was packed.   At the new house, they help get everything in the right place and did a couple of extras to make sure I was a happy camper before they left! I'm so glad that I was able to use this company and would recommend them any day and will use them  if I ever move again! Thank you!

I hope you read before you sign........BEWARE of this gym when you want to cancel........ I have used the gym 3 times over the year I paid. I went to cancel and they said I have to go in the gym to do so. Well if I don't go to work out why would I go in to cancel, I put it in writting and sent it to the corporate off just to have the local gym respond.   I also was charge all these hidden fees that they do not disclose because I did not go into the gym to cancel. Now they won't cancel my membership until the balance of unnessary charges is paid in full, which means they want to keep charging me a monthly fee. Guess its true when they say something in sounds to good to be true ($10 a month) it very much is, this compmnay will bend you which ever way to get an extra $ out of you!!! Truely sad, and makes for poor customer service.

I'm sorry to be the 1st unhappy review, but darn, my toes, still hurt. my mom, daughter and I went 2 days ago for pedicures. Thankfully my mom and daughters experience was much better then mine they had nice ladies and a good job. The lady I had tore my toes up, it was the worst pedicure I've ever had, i get gel on my toes, because my nails are weak and split alot. The lady went to remove the gel used a new nail file on my little toes, that scrub thing, then picked it off with the clipper thing and almost rip my nail off thankfully she realized it was my nail and not polish, she keep looking at the clock like she had somewhere else to be. Sorry to say I won't be back and to bad because its so close to my house!
