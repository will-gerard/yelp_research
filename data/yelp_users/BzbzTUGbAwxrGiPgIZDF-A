after someone broke into my '14 Honda Civic and stole my purse while I was in work, the dealership wanted $250 and safelite wanted $350.. Dave's replaced my front passenger window for $127!! and great customer service. I highly recommend!

I come here all the time and it used to be my favorite restaurant, but not anymore. we sat down at 6:15 and didn't leave until after 8 due to the awful service. I'm young, but not as young as I look, and I feel like that had something to do with it. The server was nice, but extremely slow and carefree. when we were waiting for more than 20 minutes for our order to be taken, we kindly asked the manager to simply let our server know we were ready to order. that's where it all went south. the manager was the rudest manager I have ever encountered and he acted like we were such a bother. once we got our food(40 minutes later) they gave us ONE BOWL of white rice for 4 entrees, and they didn't even bring my boyfriends brown rice. There was also a hair in my food, but I didn't even bother mentioning it because I just wanted to leave at that point. the only pleasant part of the experience were the kind hostesses. I won't be returning. I don't mind paying to go to eat, and I'm a server, so I always tip 30% which made me think they would have known to at least try giving me good service since I've been in multiple times before. I guess not. I won't even waste my time, and you probably shouldn't either.

bar service was absolutely terrible. my boyfriend and I were going to shoot some pool and grab some food around 10.. keep in mind they didn't close till 1 this night. the bar was moderately busy and there were 4 bartenders working. we waiting about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and when the bartender found out we were just ordering two Dr. Peppers.. he poured one, then walked around the bar, POURED SOME GRENADINE IN THE OTHER and handed it to us, as if he was pissed we weren't drinking alcohol. the billiards room was closed for a private party, but it looked like they were finishing up, and there was some other guys in there shooting pool as well. we asked the female bartender if the room was still closed and she said she would ask. after 20 minutes of us sitting at the bar, drinking my Dr. Pepper that had been tampered with, we asked again and she said it was closed. She didn't even leave the bar that entire time to ask anyone. we went to sit down at a table thinking we would get better service than the careless employees at the bar. nope. 15 minutes and the server was too busy cleaning her tables to even tell us they weren't serving anymore. no one helped us. so we got up and left. I wasn't about to pay for a Dr. Pepper that the bartender went out of his way to mess with. As we were leaving, we noticed the billiards room was open, and people were openly shooting pool again. wow. will not be returning here. This place is embarrassing to all Dave and Busters'. Don't even waste your time.

not only do they have great doughnuts and bagel sandwiches, the staff is super friendly and inviting. smiles when I walk through the door and treat me like they really care about my experience. highly recommend this place. :)

this place is great. they always take awesome care of us every time we come here. as a younger couple, a lot of places don't take my boyfriend and I seriously, but this place does. I always feel very respected and valued as a customer, and not just some dumb kid. Breanna has taken care of us 3 different times and has been incredible every time. The food is always on point, and when I got a not-so-great piece of filet, they took care of it right alway. they really know what outstanding customer service is and the food is unlike any other steakhouse in the area. I recommend 100%.

I hate giving a two star review seeing as I am a server and I work in a restaurant as well.. but I have given the bar here two chances and have regretted it each time. when I sit at the tables my service is fine, but when I'm up at the bar, I feel like I'm invisible or don't even exist. the same bar tender has helped me both times. I look younger then I am, and I don't drink.. but come on guys. took him 10 minutes to greet us.. then another 3 to get our drinks.. and another 7 to even ask us what we wanted. we orders some apps and let him know we wanted a pizza later. didn't see him again for 20 min after we finished our wings. the other bartender didn't even acknowledge us the entire time and I even saw him SAMPLE A BEER AND THEN POUR THE REST INTO A PITCHER AND GIVE IT TO A CUSTOMER. I would understand if they were busy.. I totally get it.. but that fact that they were to busy joking with the rest of the staff was what really pissed me off. still have him 20%, but he should know he gave us probably the worst service I've ever had.. and like I said.. I'm a server myself. I get it. oh well.. won't be returning here.

fuck this place. I ordered a make your own sub and halfway through telling the cashier what I wanted on my sub she cut me off to ask if my order was for here or Togo.. which I already told her. after I ordered I went to the counter to let the kids making the sandwiches know what I wanted on my sandwich since the girl at the cash register was less than interested. they looked at me like I had another head growing out of my shoulder even though I made sure I was nice and polite. after that.. we waited 25 minutes for two subs only to find out they were soggy and gross when we got home.. wow. get your shit together guys. also.. turn the air conditioner on
