These guys are the best.  They know the products inside and out, and are kind, informative, and fair in everyway.  Take the guess work out of your repair, and let them do what they do best.  I have had many Mercedes, and do know them well, but these guys have so much experience, and knowledge, and I could not recommend a more trustworthy source then the great people at MB Motors. You guys Rock!!!

Just don't eat here.  I didn't know that Heinz made salsa.  Just can't seem to find anything positive to say about this place.  This is a town with a plethora of Mexican Restaurants, so you would think that competition alone would have closed this place.  Just drive over to Sylvia's La Canasta.  Its close, and very good.

Charles was great.  He made several late trips to our home, and took on an obvisiously difficult repair.  He always came when he said he would.  Was always on time, and was reasonably priced.  The service was perfect.  Thanks Charles. Tino in Phoenix
