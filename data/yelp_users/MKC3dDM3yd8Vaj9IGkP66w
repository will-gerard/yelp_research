If there was an option for negative stars Danny's would be deserving of that rating. They suck, it's as simple as that. I took my car in for a basic wash. That's all I wanted, a BASIC wash. It took me 5 minutes and walking away from the sales rep saying "look wash my car for what I asked for stop trying to up sell my shit I don't want!" First rule of sales know when to STOP pushing.  Today I had the same experience. I received a gift card for a detail of $169. I received a call within minutes of dropping it off trying to again up sell me. Again ending in "look all I want is what's already paid for you are interrupting me at work!" Then I pick up my car and half what was paid for wasn't even done! This is the SECOND detail by Danny's where my car didn't actually get detailed. A wash and some armor all IS NOT a detail!  Stop the hard sell and do what people pay you for. This company should be out of business....oh WAIT what's that? You already ARE! Hmmm now I wonder why?

I can't say enough about this place. we visited multiple times for breakfast and have been pleased.  But ordering our pies and rolls for thanksgiving blew us away on how great this place is! Well done Jewels, well done.

I typically don't do bad reviews but this place was disappointing. The chips and salsa were great but that was it. The chicken taco was flavorless and I never did taste any chicken there was so little meat. The shrimp tacos were fishy so i didn't finish them. The corn queso dip was blah and cold. And the prickly pear green tea was just a fancy name for plain old green tea.
