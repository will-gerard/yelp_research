This is the worst expirience I have ever had with a Dr. I became a patient here and when my insurance over paid them and I decided I was not going to move forward with treatment from them any longer based on how disorganized their office staff is, I contacted them and asked that I be refunded for the over amount paid. This was 5-11 I was told that they would have to research it and I would be called back this was a thursday afternoon and I was told they would call me back tuesday with a resolution. No call back so I contacted them back and was told that they would settle the account on 6-15 as they do with all of their accounts meaning they would send a check for the overage paid. its been 10 days since that was supposed to happen and I have contacted them back several times I have email communication from them stating they would refund me and HAVE YET TO. I call the office on a wednesday at 2:30 and get told they are closed there is no way to refund me today and hung up on. I will never ever deal with this place ever again. next step is the BBB

Hair goddess!!  My hair was totally damaged 8 different colors and really in need or some serious love, I honestly didn't think it could be done. Danielle did it- she was really patient took her time and was fine with spending close to 7 hours to fix my do just to make sure it was done right!!  I would happily recommend her to anyone!!
