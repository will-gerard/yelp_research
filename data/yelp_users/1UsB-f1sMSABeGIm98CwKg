The service that this shop provides is incomplete and just awful. Long story short, they took forever to order my tire. I had to call back several times on the status of the order. Tried to make an appointment ahead of time during the tire ordering process and was told I did not need it. Came back to to find out I needed to wait an hour and half in order to be seen. Unprofessional staff and lack of customer appreciation. I would much rather take my business elsewhere and would encourage others to do the same because the "discount" is not worth my time.

Very glad we chose to eat at The Mission. By far a restaurant on my top five best dinner experiences. We usually go out to eat for dinner on Sunday evening and the place was very lively. The side table guacamole was a vert good choice, although, I must say my version of medium is much more mild than our servers (be careful with that). I had the Marinated Jidori Chicken and it was just fabulous.   Overall, I think this place is definitely worth going back to again.
