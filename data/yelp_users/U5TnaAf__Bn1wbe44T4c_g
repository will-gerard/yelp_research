First and foremost if you're planning to go...get some good wine or find a friend with a taste for the stuff and have them pick you out something to bring, they do not have any on hand and their food goes very well with it.  We started off with the 3-onion tarte which was absolutely delicious, perfectly baked and you could taste each of the three throughout the tarte.  I chose the chicken and my partner in crime chose the lamb shank.  The chicken was again cooked just right and the sauce complimented both it and the seasoned mashed potatoes wonderfully.  The green beans that came with it had a great flavor but I felt they weren't cooked enough, felt more raw than al dente.  I had some of the lamb shank, it was literally falling of the bone and a fork was all that was needed to pull off pieces to dip in the harisa-flavoured couscous.  Now I'm not one for the game flavor of lamb and this had none of the taste, just a wonderful taste overall.  We settled for the special of the night, a pear tarte with french vanilla ice cream.  The perfect ending to the dinner.  The sugary filling did not detract from the pears and went well with the ice cream.    Even though I had a groupon for this experience, I can say the experience of such a small and intimate setting will make me want to come back many more times.  This place is definitely somewhere to take a first date you're wanting to sweep them off their feet, or panties.

With a pot theme displayed over every foot of the place, and knowing most stoners to be quite the experts in how to alleviate the munchies, why wouldn't one want to come to Cheba Hut if in the mood for tasty food?  My go to sandwich is usually the Griefo, which is hemp cream cheese (vegan cream cheese with hemp seeds mixed in), peppers, avocado, lettuce and anything else on their condiment line squeezed into some garlic bread. Skip the chips and go for one of the more colorful side items of either a gooball (rice krispies, cocoa powder, peanut butter, honey and marshmallow) or one of their other brick-shaped rice krispie treat variant creations.

Pupusa trio is very filling. The carne asada was extra but the most flavorful of the bunch. The loroco flower tasted of pollen but the curtido and salsa eclipsed the flavor, but you can never have enough of those two things on any pupusa. The fried yucca was plain but the pork included was very tasty. The fried plantain was the best I've ever had, the cream gives an initial tart but then follows it with a carameled sweet that astounds the taste buds.

Clean establishment. Rows of freezers in the back. Hidden from the street. Greeted by name what must be one of the regulars. Carries both Modelo and Dos Equis. Slowly made food for being dead. The green enchilada sauce is a must. Green chile chimis are fantastic.  For the price, it was certainly filling and enjoyable. A place to come back to if you're craving decent Mexican in a sit-down environment but are too far away from a Blue Burrito Grille.

You step into the restaurant and are right away immersed in decades of sports memorabilia and history, it seems quite a few famous people frequent the place. For someone who doesn't eat red meat, the menu is a little lacking.  Not that there is anything wrong with this, I was still able to find a selection that put quite the smile on my face.   The only part of my meal that wasn't as good as I remembered from the last time I frequented D&C's many years ago was the lack of a Roquefort salad dressing, the garlic house dressing over top the fresh greens was still enjoyable though. I had the spicy broasted chicken. For those of you wondering what it is, it's cooked in a pressurized fat fryer. Much akin to KFC's original chicken, but with a slight burn from the extra southern kick. The flavors, taste and overall experience are another thing entirely. This had to have been some of the best chicken I've had in a long time that I didn't cook myself. Perfectly crispy, not a hint of grease anywhere. Accompanying the meal was a side of the cheesy au grautin potatoes, I could only eat half of it due to the feeling of my blood starting to slow down considerably in my arteries. Overall, a delicious meal.   I will advise not to get the prickly pear margarita unless you like your drinks VERY sweet. I usually expect sour when ordering this Arizona option, not hummingbird food. Next time I'll stick with a good beer for hearty food.   Service was impeccable, everyone on the staff was warm and friendly. I would caution about parking though, it's almost non-existent except valet. If you want to park your own car, you'll be walking about a quarter mile to the nearest public parking spots.

This place is south Scottsdale's dirty little secret.  If you want the awesome authentic taste of a real hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant but with the speed of a XXX-ertos (minus the Hepatitis), this is the place to go.  I've been to this place at least twenty times and I think I only ever order four things there because they're so good: the super nachos, the rolled tacos with guacamole, chicken tacos and the two carne asada burrito plate.  Any of these selections are guaranteed to keep you full for at least ten hours.  Everything comes out piping hot and both the green and red salsa provided are excellent additions to the already tasty flavors provided.  If you are in the mood for Mexican food and you're within a ten mile radius of this place, it's certainly worth the drive.

The best show you'll ever go to in Vegas.  I've been to both O and Mystere Cirque shows and this is by far the newest and most captivating.  Lots of wire jumping and feats of one-handed strength that will amaze every minute.  The Wheel of Death was the best portion of the show and as much as you may think you've seen it on a youtube video, it's a much different experience when you see these people do the things they do right before your eyes.  I will say that the ending could have been more climatic but overall you'll walk away talking about everything you saw for weeks, remembering the key points for a lifetime.

Definitely a great plce to find both that odd spice you can't find anywhere else but also great prices on bulk amounts of the good stuff you use every day.  For the lover of everything chipotle, try the Northwoods Fire Seasoning, it will be the new seasoning for just about everything.  Warning: The store has moved to Tempe Marketplace.  You'll find an empty shop if you try to look for it on Hayden now.

No matter what choice you make at this place, it's going to be fantastic.  Friday and Saturday nights you'll definitely want to make reservations ahead of time but the live music while enjoying your meal is ambiance icing on an already delicious meal.  I had the Pernil Asado plate which even without the sides was amazing.  The most succulent pork tacos on corn tortillas you'll ever taste makes you not want to put one down until finished, that is until you try the side choices.  I ordered the cornbread cassarole and the chipotle mashed potatoes, both are very generous portions and my brain couldn't make it's mind as to what my next bit was going to be because everything tasted so good.  I decided on a round-robin approach to get the most out of it all since my taste buds then couldn't become immune to one flavor.  The cornbread cassarole was a slightly bit spicy due to the chiles used but the sweet cornbread tamed it to a very light and slow burn.  Chipotle mashed potatoes, the name itself is pretty descriptive and if both of those things call to you, you will never be disappointed.  With the meal was also ordered a dragonberry Mojito which was probably the best Mojito I've had in a long time, it went really well with the entire meal...especially the sweet sugared rim as a contrast to the spicy/hearty flavors of the meal.  Excellent place, excellent food.  Only issue I could comment on is the lack of parking.  Don't park in the empty lot of Apollo's, they get real angry.  If you're not lucky enough to get a spot in the complex's small lot, you'll end up parking on the local side street, which does give the opportunity for a little post-dinner walk to help digest.

A comfortable little wine shop situated just south of Old Town Scottsdale.  Every Thursday they bring in a distributor or vintner to showcase a set of wines at their bar and collection of tables set off to the side.  For $15 you usually taste five or six wines of decent quality, the best part to the price is that $10 of each tasting goes into purchasing a bottle of one of the wines tasted. The atmosphere is quite an eclectic mix of high-brow, with food and clientele from Atlas Bistro migrating in, and casual.  The people running the place couldn't be more nice or more knowledgable in the wines they sell either.  The prices may be a touch above somewhere like BevMo, but if you're looking for the perfect wine to go with gnocchi in a basil cream sauce, these are the guys to ask!

A great place for pho in south Scottsdale, of which before this place it was severely lacking.  They have many other dishes besides this prized Vietnamese dish, but why pass up on a specialty?  Their choices within the pho category were smaller than most places I've been to but every choice is primed with great ingredients.  My favorite one so far...chicken, broccoli and baby bok choy, never found such a combination elsewhere and I search for it constantly.  I must say that the seafood pho has much to be desired as the mussels are either over or undercooked and wash out the delicate broth flavor.  If you end up with a sweet tooth afterward, try the 3-color dessert, it's something to say you've had at least once with sweet beans and green gelatin coated in sweetened milk and ice.  It's delicious and enough for two to share.

It's now been a day later and I've finally awoken from my food coma to write this review.  I first saw this mentioned on Man vs. Food and figured if it was good enough for a food critic to give a thumbs up, it was worth a shot.  All four of us ordered the Torta del Rey but on the back of the menu I see this extra entry that says "Extra meat on Torta $4", so I ask the waitress if what Adam had gotten was a del Rey with extra meat to which she confirmed in the affirmative.  So that is what I order, my less adventurous companions all order just the regular del Rey.  15 minutes later this meat Juggernaut on a plate surrounded with Ruffles chips is before me.  This is the most massive thing I've ever seen and could definitely be a front runner for an eating competition.  The sandwich was about 8 inches long and would say about 5-6 inches high.  It towered over my coke can as I, my friends, the waitresses and many other customers came by to take pictures of this gargantuan meat monstrosity.  Everyone elses torta was cut in half, mine was sadly not but held together with two skewers.  All the layers of meat inside of the torta were succulent and delicious, the size did make for a bit less enjoyable experience since each bite had to be performed in a quadrant so all the available flavors could not be combined but were segmented.  I was probably good with only half the torta, which was about a pound, but goaded by everyone around I put on my Torta Warrior face and finished the other half much to everyone's amazement.  The chips don't seem to go well with the torta, would rather have had tortilla chips to dip in the salsas provided.  Overall a very inexpensive place to eat and for a little more you can probably feed two people off one sandwich.  A must experience for anyone in the north valley.

The food wasn't bad, but myself and three of my dinner companions all came down with a severe stomach bug the day after eating here. Considering it's the only thing we came together for in the last week, and all hit the same symptoms around the same time, the deduction can't be far off as to the culprit.   We're still comparing notes as to what we had in comparison to the other four that didn't end up hugging a toilet all night. For now, I'm ringing the bell of warning that you're taking quite the risk going here.

I'm having a hard time concentrating as the urge to slip into a food nap is overwhelming after the amount of awesome food I ate here.  Visited this place and I must say that it is my absolute new place to get Indian from.  Now I have not yet had one of the regular dishes but the buffet from 11-2 had me captivated from beginning to end.  I'd have to say it's a little hard to locate and definitely not somewhere you'd go unless on a dare, being located between a Big Lots and a Food City.  Now I love putting basmati rice under most dishes as filler but this stuff you could eat by itself, it was that flavorful. They had four chicken dishes, though the Tandoori, Tikka Masala and Vindaloo all had superb flavor that begged me to get seconds even when I didn't need it.  The vegetarian choices were not quite as good as the chicken and there didn't seem to be many choices available, didn't care as it meant more room for dishes that captivated me.    The naan, this is the clincher.  We ordered the garlic naan and between it being super fresh, the right amount of oil and infused with garlic this multiplied the yum factor of everything sopped up with it by a factor of ten.  The host was super friendly and made you feel right at home, explaining dishes that I was not all that familiar with and letting us know about their online specials and coupons through Facebook.  The waiter had us topped off with water and soda before we got to the bottom of a glass, top notch.  Now I've been around to a few other Indian places in the vicinity, most notably Delhi Palace and if you like that place, you'll love this.

Gyro platter was pretty darn tasty. Definitely get with rice over fries. Dolmades seemed wilty until you discover they're just coated in olive oil. The tzadziki sauce was very dilly but overall really good. Definitely a place that will become a regular stomping grounds for me from now on.

If you're looking for some great Pho, this is definitely a place to check out.  It's located right dab in a Vietnamese shopping center, how can you really go wrong?    I ordered the Viet iced tea with cream which was a lot less sweet than the Thai teas I'm used to, it was surprising but still very delicious.  The appetizer ordered was the Summer Rolls which house a large hunk of spicy sausage in it, the sauce to dip it in was really sweet and didn't cling to the roll well, I think I'd rather have had hoisin sauce with it.  I ordered the white meat combo noodle soup bowl.  This consisted of a couple of pieces of imitation crab, fish cake balls, shrimp, pork slices and calamari.  Each was quite good in its own right except the imitation crap which had started to flake and come apart in the hot broth.  The broth by the way was fabulous, didn't overpower the meats but added enough flavor to them, much like a fondue broth, while still more than delicious enough to slurp the rest of the way through once all the solid bits were gone.  The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is even after showing we've been around the block with Vietnamese food we were constantly being given instructions on what was good and what newcomers to Vietnamese cuisine should try.  I mean once is good service, but after the customer replies that they've had it before don't continue to treat them like newbie white devils...some of us are a little more travelled than others, thanks.

Despite the nondescript outside, the onslaught of the spirits of the South that assault your nostrils tells you a totally different story. Guess there is a deficit on gator at the moment until June which was a tad disappointing but the girl behind the counter, daughter of the owner and (from the accent) a transplant from the south, was the most accommodating person ever and made us feel like family with alternate selections.   Had both the fried green tomatoes and the fried pickles. Each were excellent in their own right, with either a Cajun mustard or remoulade sauce. I had the Dunkin Catfish; 3 large strips of catfish, breaded by angels, and covered in crawfish entouffee. The amount of food was amazing.  If it's your first time there, plan on spending more than the one-$ listed, the more authentic creole dishes are a tad more pricey but completely worth it.   Word to the wise, save room for dessert, the peach cobbler was amazingly over the top.

Awesome, if you're deaf.  My girl and I went here because I saw that it was right up the street and fairly inexpensive.  We were offered bottled water while waiting for our chairs to open up and sat on the quite hard leather couches in the waiting area.  The overly large candy dish with an assortment of Star Brites and less distinguishable candies in the waiting room was a little disturbing as to how the service would be.  My massage was great.  Unlike many reflexology places where they give equal treatment to both hands, feet and scalp, only about 15 minutes of the hour is designated to non-foot action.  The two of us were in a private room together and the chairs were really comfortable.  She thought her masseuse was training because she would hear them speak in a foreign language and when she looked up it looked like he was asking the girl, who was performing mine, what to do.    The real problem was the sound.  You would start to get comfortable and you realize why the front desk guy is speaking in hushed tones, the top of the walls are open into each room and everything said above a whisper echoed loudly into our room.  They really need to soundproof those rooms before I would ever want to go back.  The last 15 minutes for both of us were spent grinding our teeth at listening to the obliviously loud man in the waiting room describe in detail his experiences with the "other" type of Asian massage.  Everytime a phonecall or person would come in to book a massage it was like a shotgun blast in the otherwise silence and we could not relax.  If you can't hear well or don't mind interruptions to your silence in order to be comfortable, this is a great place to go.  Otherwise, be prepared to have great feeling feet but a set of frayed nerves from all the interruptions.

I'm already well past half my card stamps towards a free bowl of pho, the place is definitely somewhere to visit for a Vietnamese craving without quite the cultural infusion likely to be experienced across the street at the Viet shooping center.  Half priced pho with a delectable broth and quality ingredients.  Their shrimp and pork spring rolls are huge and flavorful as well, though I do prefer a mixture of hoisin and rooster sauce over their watery citrus and peanut dipping sauce.  The only reason I knocked off a star is that I tend to get the order to-go and what is given as the additions in the pho tend to vary depending on the day, I seem to miss out on either the basil, jalapenos or something or feel a tad gypped on the additions as opposed to when I eat in.  P.S. The hostess is very nice...and for you out there interested, usually in something quite revealing.  Soup and show is always a plus. ;-)

Packed back behind other shops in Old Town Scottsdale, this is a place easily missed but should never be neglected.  The sandwiches offered are both traditional and out of the ordinary.  With a kitchen taking up half the real estate, expect to get friendly with other customers as seating is at a premium in this place.    The Reuben is a must for the first-timer, spot-on and delicious with every bite, best enjoyed with a locally brewed on-tap root beer.  I personally recommend the brie-and-pickle with sliced turkey, quite possibly the most delicous sandwich I've ever had from a deli-style restaurant, and equally enjoyed with a frosty on-tap cream soda.  Samples of both the root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda and apple cider are available and all very good.  I wasn't as much a fan of the cide as the rest of the choices, it tasted like a slightly fizzy Martinelli's apple juice.  They also offer all the choices in float form and with exotic syrups such as prickly pear.  A great place to visit in the neighborhood to get a taste of revisiting childhood and a past era.

Chicken tinga burros and grilled zucchini, oh my!  So I've been here a few times and figured it was about time to give it a review.  It's easy to pass by this as it's squeezed in between a closed down car repair shop and a Mexican party shop, complete with pinatas hanging outside.  The only giveaway is the fact that however nice your ride is, there's at least two other vehicles here way classier parked beside you.  You open a large wooden door to a cacaphony of fantastic smells, dizzied by this olfactory blast and pupils adjusting to the darkened lighting, and stumble to find an open table to sit down at.  The furniture is all heavy wood an iron, a signifier of the quality of the place, but the placing is not the best, leading to endless bumping and apologies, the only thing that could be considered a bad point to this place.  If you love salsa, this place hosts a bar with at least ten different types of salsa including ones made from ground pecans, which became addicting after the initial shock of eating salsa made from nuts.  It's hard to find for those coming with quite an appetite I recommend the Santos Plate.  It's a choice of one taco, one burrito and a generous helping of grilled zucchini.    I tend to slather anything I get in salsa to raise the spice level, the chicken tinga in a burrito does not require it at all, by the end of this huge burrito I was starting to feel sweat droplets forming but I couldn't pull away from how delicious it was.  The taco choice recommendation is the pork shoulder cooked in banana leaves, the flavor was amazing and the red vinegared topping added just the perfect amount of sweet and sour.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate but if you are, the mole taco will definitely hit those key notes with you as well.  I've never personally ordered the horchata but one of my co-workers did.  It only comes in one size, LARGE.  Be very thirsty and take your insulin beforehand.  Thirty-two ounces awaits of what was originally horchata, now spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg, ground pecans and strawberry.  Definitely not your average rice drink.  Overall you can't go wrong here, everything is made fresh, hot and delicious.  This place has become a monthly ritual spot, it should be for you as well.

I started going here from a social voucher and came with a membership card which nets me a discount every time I book.  The place is a little hard to find because of it being in a narrow, two-story house on the corner without any signage to really draw you in.  Even at the regular price this place is worth it, the girls are well-trained and will make every tight muscle loosen and pain melt away.

The country pie was at least edible and a good selection of beers were available, hence the two stars. Here's where it goes downhill. Chicken mushroom with wild rice, their most recommended dish, was severely undercooked. Brought second which was better but still a little soft. Waitress was newbie and no help from other waiters was ever offered. Even after manager came and apologized and offered to comp the meal for the raw chicken the waitress still charged us and manager was nowhere to be seen. At that point I just wanted out of there.

About the only thing I can say about it is it's ramen. Got the chili pepper ramer, which adds a glop of Thai chili paste to their soy based broth. The chicken was quite bland, and diced very small which made picking up pieces with the chopsticks quite impossible. The result leaves you with spoonfuls of bland chicken in the end, not the best ending at all to a meh meal. I suppose peddling this to college students, who haven't developed keen taste buds yet but have the disposable cash to not have to suffice on a traditional student based ramen diet, this place works. The staff was friendly and the meals were delivered quickly, even for a well packed house and close to closing time.

Come here with an appetite and clothes you're not afraid to get stained.  For the price of a burger and coke I ordered the red chili fry bread with all the fixings.  What came out was a massive floppy tostada with tons of fixins.  The chili didn't have quite the punch I was expecting but still had a good consistency and flavor.  I tried to fold the entire thing into a taco and here's where the warning of clothing comes in handy as the fry bread cannot handle this amount of pressure and the other end disgorged much of its contents, giving me a chili spatter shower.  I found the best way to eat it was to cut into quadrants and devour by hand-held sections, fork and knife seemed way too inefficient.  The dessert fry bread with powdered sugar was awesome.  The only thing I will remember for next time, just because I'm a bit of a honey snob, is to bring my own from home as the honey provided tastes a bit plain and could definitely use a notch above its station for the quality of fry bread being eaten.

Everything cooked by the most friendly lady ever. The waiter also made every attempt to help us, great service. The Tom Ka Gai beginner was just okay but every fresh dish she brought out was flavorful and interesting. Except for the Pad Thai, I think she forgot some of the ingredients, tasted kind of bland, but easily fixed with some of the other items mixed in.  Every color and flavor of curry put out was intense in its own right, not a one of them with something I could find wrong.  She also makes these fried shrimp with orange sauce that are out of this world, perfectly crispy with a tang that keeps you coming back for more with each plate.  The dessert was the best part, you must save room for it. Sticky rice with a pumpkin custard and pineapple/coconut ice cream.  The only thing I would suggest if you're coming for lunch, even though it says it opens at 11 you will want to wait until at least 11:30 before arriving.  Otherwise you're going to be filling up on only two entrees before the rest of it comes out while she's still cooking up everything.

If you're looking for hot dogs of uncommon deliciousness, this is the place to visit.  While most of the choices bring home flavors straight from the tropical island there are a few that will appease even those that don't much like the sweeter side of life.  As odd as coconut, mango and pineapple, served on hawaiian sweet bread, may sound it's something everyone should try at least once before giving judgment.  For those who know natives of the island, you know spam is "the other white meat" to them and one will find such a culinary delight here in their famous (at least to every co-worker I've brought here) spam sliders.  They have just a hint of pineapple and coconut on them (if you choose Maui-style, can also get them with teriyaki sauce instead) and a spicy mustard that you can customize from mild (for the weenies) to volcanic (macho men).  Last point, and one cannot pass up, is getting a side of tots.  V (or Vee, never substantiated which), the chef in the back who I want to steal to just cook for me, works magic on the fryer to make the best tots you will ever have.  Sprinkled with just a touch of pepper and garlic, each one is perfectly crisp on the outside while soft and steaming inside.

The Big Burrito is definitely filling and all the ingredients are super fresh. You get a wide variety of salsas to coat your food with, including a jalapeño and chipotle ranch. The al pastor tacos on Taco Tuesday are something few should ever pass up, especially when they're 2-for-1.  Even at a pretty busy lunchtime the food came out quick and piping hot.  Definitely a place to visit most days, especially every Tuesday.

Not only do you walk into a place and think "This doesn't feel like a typical movie theater, it's pretty darn fancy" with a tower skylight and indoor water fountains, but the options of real food instead of junk to eat is fantastic. The coffee and wine bar located on the other side of the entrance make fine drinks and enhance the movie going experience yet again.  The final nail in the coffin as to why I choose this theater over any other is that they have D-BOX seats. Not only can I reserve the seat ahead of time and not worry about showing up two hours early for a good seat, but once you've had a full motion viewing all other movie watching seems dull in comparison.

I wake up in the morning to everything in my bedroom turned off.  Thinking it's just the circuit breaker tripped, I flip them all and still get nothing in the room.  Now I start to panic.  I turn to Yelp and see who is rated best, up comes Good Guys Electric.  I call up GGE and Mike answers, very pleasant and close by.  He says he can take care of me the same day, no emergency charges or anything. He starts testing all the connections in the house and homes in on a very old and dangerous light switch wiring that was only a matter of when, instead of if, for causing a fire.  He even showed the melted covering and what a mess I inherited from buying an older house.  He was able to get the wires fixed up, wrapped and everything in the house artificially bright again within an hour and replacing nothing but a light switch.  If only everyone was this straight-forward and honest.  If there is ever anything electrical I need done in my house again, GGE is definitely the place I'll be calling again.  You guys are awesome!

The place is a little hard to find as there really isn't any eye-catching signage to tell you of the place, tucked in a little strip plaza with a coffee house on the other end that seems to be the only draw into the plaza.  The search is well worth it for the foodie adventurer, trust me.  They have your regular type pizzas but they also have a line of very unique specialty pizzas that keep me coming back. The white clam pizza is defintely a one-of-a-kind experience, though not for everyone.  The one pizza everyone should try once, just to get addicted to, is the sweet jalapeno fig pizza.  With jalapeno jam as the sauce, figs, caramelized onions, spinach, feta and pine nuts, it is both sweet and savory, hitting all the good points in my mouth.   The service is top notch as well, I haven't had better and more friendly service than here. I would recommend calling ahead if you plan on ordering take out, the time it takes to craft such delicious pies is lengthy but well worth the wait.

Came here on a groupon and glad I did. I see behind the counter an aging, white guy at a place called Devil Hotz and figure I should stay away from the Mexican food and veer towards the more East Coast food. Everything, no matter gets home fries and mac salad. I decided on the Philly cheesesteak.   What a disappointment. I swear the meat was Steak'ums and the green peppers had this very weird clove flavor to them. The home fries were just potatoes, no peppers or onions. The mac salad was noodles and mayo, no flavor besides me drenching the only topping around on it, Trappey's hot sauce. I'll return to try their Mexican food just because I never make a decision based on one visit. First impressions though, don't waste your time unless you want a pound of cheap, flavorless filler.

It's 9pm on a Saturday night and you've just gotten through roughly six stoutly beers and the drunk bees in your stomach are making it known they want company. This is the place to go.   I start off with the fried calamari, which were cooked to absolute perfection, not a soggy piece among them, a whole meal's worth by themselves. For my main course, the Hatch Chile Cheeseburger with a turkey substitute and the pretzel bun, and an overabundance of sweet potato tots with a chipotle aoli sauce to dip them in. I am in food heaven here. THe chiles gave the burger such a good amount of heat and the flavor...intense.   My companion and I then split one of the Pot Brownies, reese's style, cuz you gotta have peanut butter with chocolate to cut that much chocolate. I'm not sure if it's because the dessert was thought up by a pot head or because of the cast iron EasyBake pot it comes in but this darkened brick of brown love is delivered, swimming in a lake of what I soon discover is mallow creme, and topped with (you have to mention you want it or you'll sadly go without) two scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's not a dessert for the faint of heart or with diabetes, because if you don't already have to take regular insulin injections you probably will after consuming it.  Whether stoned, high, drunk, or just come down with a super case of the munchies, this little gem in SoSco will hit all your right buttons.

Because of the huge amount of Groupons sold, I had to wait nearly two months before I could get in for a weekend appointment. I must say the deluxe reflexology session was well worth the wait. Loretta was both firm and soothing in all the right places. I'm used to sitting in a chair while someone just works on my feet, this was more like a mini-massage followed by an intense foot session. There wasn't a place above my chest or below my knees that wasn't pushed on, pulled, or tweaked to spur an "Ooooh!" then immediately after an "Ahhhh". I came out of the session super light headed, with almost a prescription of trouble areas that I should focus on. Feeling fantastic after my session! Looking forward to getting another soon, maybe after the Groupons all expire so I can zip right in.   They have also moved to 2451 E. Baseline #310. It's between Gilbert and Val Vista roads.

The whiting (they ran out of catfish) was all kinds of bland except for a really strong fishy flavor (whiting is the least supposed to taste like fish), especially for "cajun fried", or was that what the bucket of hot sauce was supposed to represent? The jerk chicken tacos tasted nothing of jerk, the only noticable flavor was from the sweet thai chili sauce added on the side. The mac and cheese side was a congealed mass of fake cheese with some tasteless noodles to bind it together, and the rice and red beans were essentially that, a layer of rice with canned red beans poured over top.   The only saving grace was my partner's cajun grilled tilapia, the highlight of the meal.

Not only does the place feature the ability and experience of making your own wine, but the place also sells all products and equipment for the home brewer too. The staff has always been fabulous to me and offer great advice in case I've got a question about a certain process. I've also gone to one of their sangria challenge nights, quite a fun experience where you'll get to make a jug of sangria with some strangers and then sample each team's to judge on different factors.  Such a great add to the heart of Scottsdale!
