Don't come here expecting Pei Wei or some kind of creative gourmet fusion. This is nothing more or less than the classical American Chinese food experience - what Chinese restaurants were when I was a kid. 4 stars for food but 5 stars for service with a smile and reasonable prices for lunch, dinner and happy hour. And 5 stars for the Ginger Broccoli Beef! Sad to hear others have negative experiences but I've been here about once a month for the last year and have found it consistently good.

Yelp suggests that 2 stars means "Meh. I've experienced better." And I think that is the appropriate rating for an experience that starts off promising it will help you achieve your fitness goals but ends with the familiar and sickening feeling that you're just a cash cow.  If you are like me or one of the many graduate students in this area looking for a positive, professional and results-driven workout for a year or less, keep looking. You're better off using your money for some lessons from a personal trainer, some music for your mp3 player, and varying up your routine as much as possible.  While I love the intensity of OT workouts and the great music, I have gotten more motivation and knowledge out of DVDs from Target.  OT is just like a 24-Hour or LA Fitness chain, which make money from sign-ups, NOT from service or results. The main difference at OT is the sleek interior design, a claim to be more effective, and over $100 per month - the premium for so-called training.  When I signed up here, they acted like they really wanted to see me succeed, but sadly they never did anything to help me monitor or achieve the goals they asked me to set. That makes me think it was just a show to get me to sign-up. They had us download an app which supposedly offers many cool functionalities, none of which work (except for the ability to book a session, which by the way can be impossible to do during evening and weekend hours. They don't care if you get in; in fact, it benefits them when less people sign up.) Any questions I asked, I usually got a shrug in response. OT's claim to fame is "heart-rate tracking", but they don't store any information after you walk out the door, nor do they help you interpret it. It may well be a gimmick, and I'm sure they are making a lot of money on that high elastic strap surcharge. My heart rate monitor was constantly out of whack so I didn't even really benefit from having it. At OT, "trainers" don't teach proper stretching. The class is so fast-paced they barely have time to show you correct form before racing to the next exercise. You have to beg for attention and help if you want to learn - when you look around and see everyone doing it differently, it makes you wonder if anyone is doing it properly.  Today the manager, who is never there because he also runs another franchise location, referred to one of the associates as "my front desk girl," I realized what kind of establishment I was dealing with and gave up my request not to be charged for the 60 days after my official cancellation. OT is not a franchise that trusts its own managers to run a business. Instead, it values short-term profits from sign-ups over long-term relationships. It was an expensive lesson to avoid Orange Theory, and I hope this review can save a few people having to pay the same price.   If you decide to give it a try, I hope you are extremely self-motivated and already very knowledgeable about how to achieve your fitness goals. I hope you also have the foresight or legal expertise to actually cancel 60 days before you want to stop going, even if they claim its 30 days notice.
