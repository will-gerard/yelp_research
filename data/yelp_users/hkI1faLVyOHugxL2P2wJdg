Wonderful experience! Being from Italy, I always have the urge to check out new places, and when I saw "Italian cuisine" I had to stop and test it. As I walked in, I immediately felt welcome. Kelsie, the bartender, was very nice and friendly. Excellent start, since the authentic Italian culture is based on welcoming and well-mannered people. Food was outstanding as well. I had the mozzarella caprese followed by the special of the day: halibut piccata. But what really impressed me was the dessert: limoncello cake!!! It's not like the usual American cakes with tons of sugar and frosting...this cake was at the 'right degree' of sweetness, very light and fluffy. Concluding, 5 stars to Christo's! I'll definitely come back to try the pasta! :-)

Pleasant experience! First time here, I found the atmosphere welcoming and the staff very friendly. They have a nice patio facing the parking lot, it reminded me of my hometown Milan. Food was amazing!! Had a glass of Benvolio Pinot Grigio, nice and sour, the special of the day Chicken provolone, and I ended my meal with a tiramisu. I have to say the tiramisu really won my heart!! So fresh and creamy. The service was also exceptional, Octavio took great care of me. I definitely have to come back to try the pasta!!

Lovely place in Central Phoenix, very well decorated with walls of bottles of wine. I love their bruschetta special. You get to chose 4 different types. The prosciutto and figs stole my heart! Very good selection of wine, I loved their Verdicchio from Italy, nice and crispy white. Recommended for dinner and late snack time!!

Nice crust, not the best I've ever had though. I like the option that you can either order the whole pizza or just by the slice. I was looking for a thin crust pizza so the lady recommended to order it by the slice. I built my own with pepperoni, 2 kinds of cheeses, artichokes, and jalapeño. It was very good. They make every pizza upon order, so it doesn't sit there for hours and hours. I'll come back eventually.

Fantastic! I love Red Lobster and I wish there was one closer to my place! I had the lunch Atlantic salmon with veggies, it was delicious and cooked to perfection. The New England Clam Chowder was also really good. I also had the most amazing chocolate Martini!! My waitress, Jane, was nice and very professional! My bill turned out to be $26, a very reasonable price for a delicious and healthy meal! I'll definitely come back soon! :-)

Food is good, as always, Red Lobster is one of my favorite restaurants (it has always been). The two stars go to the service: we were a party of five on Friday night (not really busy night) and we hardly got checked on. Our waitress was nice, but we had to repeat our requests twice, like more silverware for everyone, drinks, etc. (thumb down). When she brought biscuits (after 20 minutes we were seated) there were only 4 of them instead of 5. When we asked her if she could bring more, she answered she's only allowed to bring 4 per basket. Now I don't want to mess with Red Lobster policy (again, it's one of my favorite places), but this answer sounds very silly to me! If you know your party has 5 people, at least bring 2 baskets!!! Right? Everyone got a lobster entrée, which includes a salad, so everyone got a Caesar salad first. What I didn't like was that our entrées came before we were all done with the salads. I personally felt rushed. I'm in the same industry and I know it's up to the waiter/waitress to properly manage the timing between salads and main courses. Whatever. Maybe the lady was new and it was just a one bad case. But for a quiet Friday night, I would have expected more attention. Will I go back? Of course, I love Red Lobster! But please, for the very well trained team you have, more attention must be paid!

Fourth or fifth time I'm here and I love this place! Food is good and prices are very convenient, especially if you're just one person...with 10/12 dollars you have soup or salad, main course and dessert! Just perfect for a lazy college student like me! Also the staff is very kind :-)

So after giving this place other tries, I've reconsidered my opinion and I've seen improvements. Staff is nicer, more welcoming. And food is always exceptional. 5 stars and this is my new favorite place for breakfast.

I really liked this place! The location is one of the best spot you can have to admire the big fountain. Food is really good and fresh! I recommend the insalata caprese!! My server, Elizabeth, was nice and very attentive!! Price are very reasonable. This is definitely one of my favorite casual place to dine when I visit Fountain Hills!  Concluding: 5 stars for excellent service, good food, good location, and reasonable prices. ;-)

Quick and easy!! Come here with lots of quarters, because the machines don't accept credit cards or bills. However, there is a money change machine right next to the dryers. This place saved my life in a day when I absolutely needed to do my laundry! Definitely recommended! :-)

My boyfriend and I went there for desserts last night. Our intentions were to get the chocolate lava cake, but unfortunately we found out that they do not have it anymore since 5 years. No big deal! Instead, we got the ancho chocolate cake and the pecan pie...they were both really delicious! Our service was very kind with us! I liked also the classy and romantic atmosphere of the restaurant. This place definitely made our Sunday night even greater! :-)

I've been here for the second time and it was very good as the first one.  There is a special dessert called rum cake with foster bananas that is just amazing!! I would recommend to match it with an Espresso Martini...yummy!!   The only negative point was about the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin: too dry and overcooked.  Anyway, this is still one of my favorite places!! :)

I am sorry to give one star, but after the second attempt I can definitely say that the food is VERY DISAPPOINTING!  I tried the chef salad and the quality was just low. Usually I am an indiscriminate eater, but this salad was just disgusting.  Second time I ordered the rigatoni four cheese and a Caesar salad... The pasta doesn't even taste pasta. I am from Italy, and in my opinion, pasta must to be cooked in certain ways. The rigatoni were overcooked and the cheese was bitter and just not good. The Caesar salad wasn't that bad, but neither special. I am disappointed because a friend of mine recommended this place for pasta, but I didn't like it. I am sorry but I won't come back.

Try the Barbecue Baby Back Ribs!! It's absolutely FANTASTIC!! The meat is so tasty and tender, the beans and the baked potato are delicious!! It's a nice pretty cheap steakhouse, I definitely recommend it! :-)

Excellent place to dine if you want to eat something good and cheap at the same time. I have tried the location in McDowell and Miller Rd twice. The service is very good, people are friendly. Both of times I've been pleasantly surprised. :-)

Buonissimo! My boyfriend and I had lunch here with a caprese and a Italian sausage sandwich. They were both WONDERFUL! The caprese was so tasty and the mozzarella cheese so fresh and creamy. My boyfriend particularly appreciated the spicy Italian sausage. In addition, I had the Birra Moretti...the queen of Italian beers, so light and regenerative. I'm Italian from Milan and for me was like feeling home again. I've noticed that all the products they have are really authentic imported from Italy, and I think I'll buy some of the products for some Christmas presents. We'll definitely come back! É stato spettacolare e ci ritorneremo presto. L'Italia é sempre l'Italia.

Buonissimo! Excellent place for an authentic Italian experience. My friend and I had lunch here, we were both curious about their pasta and their sauces. We started with a house salad (perfect size to share), and I have to say the white vinegar aftertaste worked magic. Lasagna was good, but not the best (maybe a little more besciamella next time), orecchiette with sausage and rapini was AMAZING!! Al dente, sauce not too heavy, we both loved it. Our waiter, Lauren, took great care of us. We'll be back for more pasta and wine!!

Simply delicious!!! My boyfriend and I are fans of the White Chocolate Grill! I ordered the chicken crepes with mushrooms cream and honey carrots...it was a dream! Then I had a marvelous white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, my boyfriend helped me eating it...it was big and very rich! As cherry on top we had two spiced rum iced tea (good stuff). Our waitress was nice and attentive, she recommended the cheesecake (good choice). I also like this place for the intimate atmosphere...just perfect for me and my partner!! Hihi fabulous!! :-)

Reading some reviews about Sprinkles, I agree with two points: - the frosting is too sweet and too much for a cupcake - the cost for each cupcake is too high  So as a place to buy cupcakes is definitely not one of the best, there are other cheaper places with more natural and less sweet flavor. I love cupcakes and so far the only one I enjoyed was the Red Velvet. Other cupcakes were just "ok"...

Wonderful late night experience! The place was not too crowded nor loud, which I really appreciated. They have a patio with nice couches and a play area. We didn't have to wait a minute, they immediately gave us water and menus. My friend had a Manhattan while I ordered a "Daily Mule", a tasty version of the Moscow mule but with Jim Bean instead. Delicious! I'll keep this place in mind for late night bars.

Not really sure why there are so many bad reviews on yelp about this place...I found it impeccable both times I've been here for lunch, making me want to stop by again, and maybe try their breakfast too. First time I had Grace, second time Zach. Staff is really friendly and welcoming, menu is variegated. I wanted to get their tenderloin steak but I was warned it was pretty small so I ended up having their rib eye, cooked to perfection, juicy and tasty. It was paired with crispy roasted potatoes and green beans, a perfect meal to go with an ordinary day. The location is also wonderful, just a few feet from the lobby of the Hilton!!!

All the beers you can have for sure!! I had the Mr. Pineapple, softly flavored blonde beer and I paired it up with the blackened salmon. The quinoa with the salmon was a delish. Their patio facing the canal is also nice!!

I've lived at Chazal just for one week, and I've found a perfect place to stay: the customer service is excellent, the location is good and quite, the apartments are big and clean. If you have trouble to run some stuff, you can ask to the leasing office, and they are ready to help you. It's not one of the cheapest but it's worth it. The only little negative thing is the size of the pool and gym: they are both too small. However, I really recommend to lease here. :)

Good deal! I brought two kitchen aprons to personalize with names and short phrases and Savi, the lady at the store, did a wonderful job! She was attentive and meticulous with all my directions and I had my aprons ready in two days, just before Christmas! The price also was really fair. I'm totally satisfied and I think I'll come back for any sewing work. :-)

4 stars for the location, the high food quality, and the large menu selection. However, in my opinion they need to work on the service which could be better. Ok that it's just breakfast, but the customer always needs to feel welcome.   Anyway, I had a biscuits and gravy plate with eggs, bacon, and potatoes. And a large cappuccino. Simply delicious.

One of my favorite places to eat healthy and less expensive. The salads are just 8-9 dollars and they are tasty and fresh!! Definitely recommend if you are a fan of salads!! The only negative point is the location, which is not very big and it's difficult to find a parking spot.

Okay EVO, I've been here enough times to speak my mind:   Pros: - I love the fact that you're open til late (after my Chem lab class the only thing I want is pasta!!)  - The Mushroom risotto is divine! I ordered it twice and both times was delicious!! The Bolognese is really good as well. - nice location with a parking lot (thumb up in Oldtown)   Cons:  - sorry to say, but your service is nothing impressive...only because I don't drink, I still deserve the same "friendly" personality that you show with other customers. - two of your dishes are heavily salty: gnocchi and cauliflowers side...when I expressed my disappointment, no action was taken nor it was taken off from my bill. (This happened at least twice). I also tried the Amatriciana and it had the opposite problem: too insipid. Of course when you asked me how the food was I told you the truth, but it seemed to me no matter what I tell no solution is provided. Well then that's no point of asking me how the food is!  - the Caesar salad has too much garlic, it's overpowering!  - you charge for the bread???? NO WAY! I ordered it once assuming it was included, the waiter didn't mention anything about an extra charge, and I still had to wait 10 minutes for a piece of toasted bread to go with my pasta. - check out other restaurants EVO! No one charges you for a piece of ordinary bread!   I was once very impressed with the Bavette. It's a pasta with a special kind of garlic and olive oil sauce (I guess) but then it was taken off the menu. I asked once if they could make it and they did. But then they told me it wasn't available anymore because they didn't have the ingredients. Too bad. For the Bavette, I would had come back more often, giving 5 stars only for that!   So in the end, I'm not only disappointment for some of your dishes, but also for the way you treat an (almost) regular customer.   Maybe I'll start to tip a little less, and you'll understand what I mean.

I'm very satisfied with my new haircut. I've been here several times and I knew I could count on good quality work and good prices. I had the $16 deal hair cut plus hairstyle with dryer for a total amount of $36. I couldn't get the guy's name, but he was tall, blonde, with a few tattoo and a heavy accent. He was very friendly and professional, really did a good job!!!!!

I went to Cornish Pasty in Goldwater a few days ago and I had a wonderful experience;  1) the food is spectacular and very particular, I had the "carne avolada pasty" and I found it delicious; 2) the service and the staff is even better... I was there because of my boyfriend's birthday party and they took good care of us, also with the birthday cake brought at the end of the dinner...(perfect timing) 3) the prices are good, not too expensive and not to cheap.  Concluding, if you want to try an English place, this is the one you're looking for! :)

Best car wash!! Reasonable prices and excellent services!! I love the "tire shine", it makes my tires look amazing! One time I drove over and they had a technical problem with the brushes, and they offered a coupon of $5 on a $10 car wash. I really appreciated that they give you discount in case something doesn't work! It's also very fast too! Definitely recommended!

I came here a couple of nights ago for the second time, and I have to say the quality of the pizza is still amazing! There's something about the crust, so crispy and flavorful that makes me want to drive just to have a bite of it!! I love the Grandma and the Caprese!!! Staff is always cordial and attentive! 5 stars!!!

Unfortunately I'm not impressed with this place. The reason? Poor food quality. I ordered an ordinary scramble eggs with bacon and side of fruits. The eggs tasted like rubber, I don't think they were prepared upon order...the fruit was tasteless and old, of course not the same idea that you get when they tell you "fresh fruits"...the bacon was okay, but I've had better ones. I'm sorry to give only two stars...after all the staff was really nice and friendly, however, in my opinion, they need to improve on their food quality.!!

My boyfriend and I went there for dinner last night. It was simply awesome!! The food is very particular and delicious, a mix between Mexico and Asia...yummy!! the service is even better! I've heard that one of the detriments of this place is the loud  atmosphere...well, in my opinion the noise average is not quiet but not too loud either. It's a place for young people, with two huge tv screens for watching games, so it's perfectly ok a little bit of noise. I recommend the Suzuki sushi, it's special!  I definitely understand why SumoMaya is in the top 10 best new restaurants in the Valley! We loved it! And we'll be back soon!  :-)

Nice brunch! My friend and I had the Lobster and smoked salmon Benedicts and we both loved it! Bloody Mary was good too, although I could barely taste alcohol...be aware that it's loud!! We wanted to seat outside but there wasn't room...I would come back but in a less busy day and definitely away from the noise!

Simply wonderful! The food, the service, the atmosphere...really make you feel home. My boyfriend and I ordered the pear salad and the fico pizza. They were both delicious! I mostly appreciated the texture of the pizza dough, thin and tasty. The fico sauce was a dream!! Our waiter, Andres was charming and attentive ;-) I'm glad to see that it's already getting busy! The tiramisu was also very good and juicy! :P Therefore, we'll definitely be back!

If you're looking for an ordinary breakfast meal, any place will be fine. But if you have a refined palate and want an amazing breakfast, go to Hash Kitchen! This brand new place offers a large selection of breakfast meals like eggs Benedict, burgers, salads, pancakes, and more...and for the second time I was speechless!! The smoked salmon eggs Benedict that I ordered was delicious and cooked to perfection!! My friend had the Italian sausage eggs Benedict and she was impressed too! Melissa, our waitress, was friendly and professional. The entire staff welcomes you with a big smile. (Very important factor). Parking is available anywhere you like in the plaza. Conclusion: I recommend this place and I'll come back soon with more buddies!! ;-)

Uh! Heaven has a BASE!! I've heard lots of people bragging about this place and, indeed, it did not disappoint. We were warmly welcomed by the owner, Carlee (I hope I spelled it right), which immediately seated us on the patio and offered us specials of the day. My roommate and I had the beet and arugula bruschetta, freshly served with balsamic reduction, and then we went for a Spicy Snag and a Mediterranean pizza...BOTH SUBLIME!! The crust is thin and crispy, and it makes that nice crunchiness sound when you bite it, you can tell it's good stuff! We loved the atmosphere as well, enjoying the mountains view with Frank Sinatra's songs (big thumb up for that) is just what you need to accompany a good meal!! I also appreciated their dessert selection: not the usual tiramisu or cannoli as you might assume in a pizzeria, they had the most extraordinary homemade Australian Pavlova and the portion was pretty generous too. Prices are fair, $10-15 for a pizza, $14 for the dessert - I was a bit turned off by that at first, but on second thoughts I agree it's totally worth it. Service was great, Carlee made our experience phenomenal. So we will definitely come back!!! :-)

A jewel of the molecular gastronomy. Freezing liquid nitrogen to make ice cream is nothing new, however I'm impressed by how they furnished the place and how they got so busy after only two weeks they've been open. I think the name Creamistry is BRILLIANT...being a Chemistry fanatic, it immediately caught my attention. Prices are not cheap I have to say, but it's worth it. I got the double with Nutella and topped with strawberries, my friend had the $7.50 coffee ice cream. They were both top notch! Consistency is a bit different from regular gelato, thicker I would say. It was the 4th of July and I got a 20% discount on my bill  because I was wearing American flags. Nice right? And if you bring back your receipt within a week they'll give you the 10% off. So in the end I like the fact that they "reward" you for the visit. Will go back to try more flavors.
