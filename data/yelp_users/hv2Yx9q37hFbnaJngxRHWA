Not a fan.  Bar is mediocre. They don't know how to make a basic mixed drink. I lucked out by just ordering saki but my partner went through three cocktails that he didn't finish because they were so poor.  Sushi is meh.  Service could be loads better.

The tamales sucked! Frozen tamales are better. The skirt steak was undercooked and made the partner sick.  It was a good reminder as to why we should all avoid restaurant chains. At least I should. I'd rather have tacos and carne fries from any of the ----berto's than go back. Alcohol couldn't even make it better.

Best service in Arizona! Not a single detail was missed. If you are someone who needs to be addressed by name and thanked and welcomed back each time you run into a member of the staff, this is the perfect place for you. Our server was full of great recommendations, knowledge of the food and culture.  He exhibited the menus like they were pieces of art, and they are beautiful, and explained the meaning behind each painting.  It added to the experience of delighting our tastebuds in Native inspired food.   We opted to forgo "The Birth" and went straight to "The Beginning," where we ended up ordering all three of the options.  My favorite bite was scooping the lobster flan with a piece of the popover.  I never knew fry bread and lobster could go so well together.  I had the elk loin, which was a decadent as our server warned, but the good kind of decadent, where leaving even a morsel seems like a sin. The partner had the buffalo and it had a really great mild heat that hit the back of the throat.  Everything was well seasoned. The staff even had a sense of humor, which was greatly appreciated.  It made us comfortable in an environment that is dangerously on the stuffy side.  We were celebrating the partners birthday, and they definitely made it feel special.  When we got the car back from the valet they had a birthday card waiting, a chocolate bar and cold water.  Kia definitely deserves all the accolades it gets. I can't wait to go back.

The night started off with a bet. The partner and I were celebrating our first year anniversary and there wasn't a better place to celebrate than Kai. After having an excellent adult beverage at the bar we found out our server from the last visit was working and requested him. I bet the tab that if my partner called Kevin, K-Money or K-Dawg, I'd be happy to pay.  Well he did and Kevin ran with it.  He's the kind of server that even if we asked for him to rap for us he'd do it. He laughed at my jokes about the super bowl half time show and showed genuine interest when we discussed Indigenous creation stories. We had initially decided to forgo the birth and order everything off the beginning then our entrees, but Kevin and our bartender swore by the deliciousness of the soup.  Any fine diner in the valley can attest the super popularity of truffle and how over used the product can be. It's become almost like the useless parsley on your Denny's breakfast platter, with the exception that it over powers the many crudos and veggies it's meant to compliment. It's become so overwhelming that anytime I see it on the menu, no matter how appetizing the food may sound, I opt for something else.  However, Kai does it right. The truffles balanced the lamb, potato and broth with an earthy sweetness that made it over the top.  Just smelling the soup put a smile to my face. The escargot was just as wonderful.  The entire beginning was awesome, though this time we did not order the lobster. Just before our entree service we got some bad news so I can't comment much on the main course.  What I can comment on, is that K-Money was awesome about us having to cut out early. He boxed our entrees without us having to ask and sent us home with a complementary dessert and truffles. The sweet potato cake was sweet, moist and the accoutrements went well with the cake. Kevin listened well to our needs, knowing I was not a chocolate person and partner was. He found the balance we needed to share a dessert.  To top it all off, we found a card waiting in the car when we got it back from the valet. The usual chocolate bar and water bottles were there, but the card was signed K-Money.  It was small touch, but it showed how much they valued us as customers.  And while many may look at other restaurants because the price tag is intimidating, for the service and food, Kai is worth much more. With a bottle of Dom, four cocktails, and all our food, the bill was still under 500.00. It's a must have for any special occasion.

Why do I always fall for the commercials that show juicy crab, lobster and shrimp!?  You'd think I would know better by now, I mean it is a chain.   My experience with chains are that the service is normally consistently good with over salted food, or bad with over salted food.  This experience was the latter.  The one thing I will say Red Lobster has going for it, is pretty delicious cocktails.  I am normally a beer and wine kind of gal, but their fruity beverages enticed the partner and I, so I went for the sangria and the partner went for the strawberry mojito.  Both were fruity and delicious with just the right amount of an adult bite.  I ordered the snow crab legs and they were good, but they were only steamed with no flavor.  The butter was too salty and the potato was overcooked. The partner ordered the lobster linguini with a Maine lobster tail on the side.  The lobster on both was over done and rubbery.  So if your jaw needs a good workout, I'd recommend it, otherwise save your Benjamins for something local with better quality.

The burgers are all bread.  Shakes are over priced.  The fries are over seasoned.  The prices are a bit exorbitant for what you get. I don't mind spending money on good food, but I feel like I could get something better at Wendy's.

I must preface that my rating has nothing to do with the food. The food was awesome with fantastic presentation. The foie gras and dumplings were delectable. I have had better fish but it was still on par with most of the places I've visited lately. The pork chop, however, was orgasmic! And they served the best dessert I've had since I started on yelp.  The reason I've rated it four stars is because of the service. Now, the service wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. Have you ever been to a place and just feel the complacency of the employees? That's the feeling I got from the service. Our server declined to clear dishes and always waited for a buster to come around. The host didn't pull out our chairs, which I wouldn't expect from most places, but from a resort and that kind of money being spent, it's something that I've become accustomed to. But the number one thing that really made the score drop was that the valet counted his tip in front of us. Again, the food was amazing. I just think the service can be better.

I know I've found a good place when my stomach starts grumbling as soon as I walk through the door. The earthy notes of garlic and onion with a little sweetness of fresh tomatoes simmering made me swoon as soon as I entered.   The guy behind the counter was full of recommendations and super nice. I also loved being able to walk around and see all the different imported groceries. I have not had a bad experience at Defalco's.   I think I've ordered everything on the pasta side and have thoroughly enjoyed everything.  If I'm taking out my niece and nephews, this is one of my go to spots because I trust the service and quality of food, plus we can binge on the sweets after.  The sandwiches are also very good. They stay together well and have a good balance of flavors, plus the bread isn't overwhelming, nor does it fall apart.  I have not tried the pizzas or calzones but the last time I was in, I caught a glimpse of one and believe I will have to make that my next target when I visit again.

I've been to Tricks a few times, but only to the bar, where I've had excellent beverages, food, and service.  Dining was a disappointing experience in comparison. I anticipated it to be busy because it was restaurant week and Wicked was playing at Gammage, so I was prepared for the service to be slightly impacted.  We were seated right away because our reservation was set for 6:30.  Upon sitting down, it took about 10 minutes for water to come to the table and for our server to introduce himself and take our drink order.  It took another 20 minutes for him to bring the drinks and take our food order.  While waiting for our drinks to come, we had the unfortunate privilege of an angry customer basically yelling at the manager about the time it took for service and food.  It didn't set the best mood for the night.  Once our server did get our order the food came out pretty fast and as it slowed his service improved but the first hour tainted our experience for the night. I really enjoyed the flavors of the food, but the execution was off.  The foie gras was room temperature, the lamb rack was tough and chewy and the scallops were undercooked.   I also found it odd that the chef refused to allow exceptions on the restaurant week menu.  There was a dumpling I wanted to try and the chef said that only people doing the restaurant week menu would be able to order off of it.  It didn't make sense to me for a couple reasons.  As a customer ordering off the normal menu we were spending more money than the 3 course menu offered during restaurant week and it would've been easy to mark up the cost of the entree in order to accommodate the table.   When it did slow, our server was able to get an exception on getting us a dessert off the restaurant week menu.  I was excited to try the creme brûlée with balsamic reduction, but the balsamic was overpowering.  If I go back, I will be sticking to the bar.  For the cost of dining in and the service, it's not worth the money spent.

I absolutely love the valley ho!  I decided to surprise my partner with a weekend staycation and dinner.  The shrimp cocktail is awesome! Their cocktail sauce has a nice kick and super flavorful.  The basic green salad was dressed perfectly and was refreshing.  I loved my Cornish hen. They butterflied it for a beautiful presentation. My partner had the stroganoff and was pleased. I didn't get to taste because I was super excited about my dish.  The huckleberry creme brûlée was silky, tart and sweet. I loved it!  The only reason for the lack of a star was because of the service. It wasn't horrible, but lackluster. Our server didn't even ask if we wanted dessert and just brought the check and we had to request the dessert menu. The table next to us had much better service, but they also had a different server.

The best thing about this place is the authenticity of the menu and service.  Our server made some amazing recommendations from the stuffed squash blossoms to the cream puffs for dessert.  I had the Osso Buco di Maialino and it was great. I didn't even need a knife because it was melting off the bone.  My partner had the seafood pasta special and it was a bit disappointing. The lobster was overcooked and so was the majority of other shellfish on the plate. The sauce was really good but the other stuff was just meh.  I would definitely love to try it out again. The spaghetti with meatballs looked awesome.

First and foremost: Rene, our server, was by far the best server my partner and I have ever had. She was knowledgeable about the food and history. Most of all she was super friendly and made us feel at ease. She also found a bottle of champagne off the menu that suited my partners taste. The food runners were just as great!  My partner surprised me with an amazing brick oven experience with 8 courses. Every course was amazing but my favorites were the gnocchi, pork belly and halibut.  From the first bite to the last my tongue was waltzing.  Tip: if doing the brick oven experience during the summer choose a late reservation. We went at 5pm and it was a bit toasty. My partner didn't think to ask if it was outdoors and so it took him by surprise. I know if we had asked they would've been accommodating and put us inside, but the setting was so gosh darn gorgeous.  We definitely plan to go back.

I cannot express how amazing your experience will be if you ask for Rene! She is friendly and makes amazing recommendations. It's been six months and she even recognized us.  Plus, the food is fantastic. The current crudo is packed with tons of flavor, and the gnocchi is like biting into a cloud. My steak was done expertly and all the veggies on the plate made it easy for the partner (who hates veggies) fall in love with their flavor.  We opted to eat inside this time and it was almost as intimate as eating at the brick oven.  I rarely like desserts but it's hard to pass up the superb combo of fresh apples, hazelnuts and creamy cannoli. This is definitely a place you don't want to pass at satisfying your sweet tooth.

Roy's has been on my list for awhile. I've never heard anything great or negative about the place, but the menu definitely made me salivate.  The cocktails are great, fruity just as I like them.  The wagu roll was good but it needed an element of crunch and some acidity. The lobster dumplings were rich but felt like they were missing something.  I ordered the butterfish. Our server totally sold me on it because it's what their known for, but I didn't like it. The coconut milk was overpowering. The fish was executed perfectly, but all I tasted was sweetness. Way too much sweetness.  The partner ordered the scallops and they were good but the park belly was more fatty than crunch. The fennel greens seemed out of place and didn't blend well with the other flavors. It definitely needed something else to make the marriage work.  Dessert was ok. The lemon was a nice zing to a one note meal.

I like coming here for the alcohol and movie experience.  The seats are comfortable, but the dining while watching can be a bit distracting.   I suggest sticking with basics when it comes to the food. They make a decent quesadilla, but it's pretty hard to mess one up. Avoid the shrimp!  If you like strong mixed drinks then this is the place to go, otherwise stick with beer.   And, if you have superman ears, try to avoid listening in on server and bartender conversations.  I overheard a couple racial comments and it got me heated.  Those kinds of conversation shouldn't take place anywhere around where customers can hear.

My partner gives me hell for loving Korean Dramas, and thought I was nuts that I wanted to try to food based on something I've seen on television, but he decided to give it a shot with me, after several months of convincing.   One word: Love! The food at Chodang is consistently flavorful and delicious.   The partner can't get enough of the spicy bbq pork, he even asks for extra sauce on the side, though upon this last trip it proved to be just a tad too spicy for him with the addition. My favorite part of the dishes at Chodang, is the balance of flavors.  Nothing I've had there has just been one note, even the side dishes (excluding the marinated seaweed). Each dish covers at least three flavor profiles and if you want more, add a bit of kimchi, bean sprouts or another side dish to get a richer experience. My favorite so far has been the 74 (I don't want to butcher the spelling of the dish).  The combination of the octopus, kimchi and bulgogi is wonderful.   When I'm sick, the tofu soups, especially the seafood tofu soup, is how I find comfort, plus the spiciness is great for the sinuses. (Make sure to get it with an egg table side.) Chodang also introduced me to the JPop, and I have to say it's now a staple whenever I have a meal there.  The service is great too! They aren't overbearing, and they do not provide the snobby kind of Asian service.  I've been to many Asian run restaurants where if you don't look like you are from their country they will give you a generic menu.  Chodang serves everyone equally.

Holy cow has the fair gotten expensive. I took three kids, my partner and of course me. In total we spent over $400 because the rides were ridiculously expensive.   The coupon book is a joke. In order to get any value in it you have to spend even more money on junk you don't even want. The only items that came in handy were the one game get one for free and even then not all the games participated.  The fair food was great but $20 for a turkey leg wrapped in cheap bacon was a bit overboard.  I don't think I will go back. It's a better deal to drive to Cali for their amusement parks.

I'm not a fan of barbecue. Eating large slabs of meat with a garnish of cole slaw doesn't have much appeal for me. Don't get me wrong, I love my protein, but a well executed salad is more up my alley.  The partner wanted the sampler so I gave in and shared it with him. I didn't care for the ribs and brisket, but the barbecue chicken was by far one of the best barbecue chickens I've ever had. It was moist and went well with my adult lemonade.  The most surprising part of my adventure in meat land was the service. It was really great! I didn't catch his name but he was full of recommendations, honest with his feedback and he even brought a small bowl of cherries for my niece who only wanted cherries and nothing off the dessert menu.

I used to frequent this place a lot. However, this was my first time back in over a year.  I love that the owners are always present.  That's probably the only consistent thing about the place.  The service was super slow compared to my last visit and the food was just eh. I'm not sure the changes they've made over the last year or so are working out.  It was my partners first time and he thought it was like an upgraded Denny's.  I'm super sad that it's not as great as it used to be.

I seem to make perfect timing every time I go here because I never wait more than five minutes. Though I've seen the rush after I arrive and the wait can be up to 45 minutes.  They make an awesome hollandaise sauce for the Benedicts and their peach pancakes are delicious. Not a fan of the potatoes but everything else has been great.  If you order a mimosa prepare to wait a bit. The Service is always friendly.

I went to Posh to check out the hype, to see if it's really worth all the accolades. It fell short. By short, I mean we left after the fifth course because the food was bleh. If I had my way we would have left after the third. Especially since they have an unbelievable wait between courses. We were there for three hours!  The amuse was interesting, combining peanut butter, tomatoes, avocado, cocoa and chili powder. The chili powder was undistinguishable.  My melon salad was the best thing I had, but the honey dew was not ripe. It tasted like biting into the rind of a watermelon.  The mahi mahi was dry, rubbery, and over seasoned. The mushrooms and broth were the saving grace of the dish.  I threw up after the foie gras (and I really love foie gras). The sorbet was ok but lacked seasoning. The honey comb and fritter type thing was overly sweet and the seared was like biting into canned Vienna sausage. Even the memory makes me gag.  They served me a pork cheek after and it was like biting into gelatinized fat. And to top it off was extremely salty.  My partner wasn't as dissatisfied as I was. He ate the portions I didn't finish. But he did say we could have had a better dinner at outback, which is one of our least favorite places.  The service was good but slow. Especially since the server said he controlled the pacing of our meal. To be fair there was only one other server, a bartender and four dudes in the kitchen.  I really wanted to give one star, but the decor and set up was great and our server was super knowledgeable and helpful, that is when he was able to serve us.

I love Tops! I have not had one bad recommendation from the rotating regular bartenders.  Issa has an amazing palette and can recommend something to the pickiest of bar snobs.  Ryan always has good music playing, and if you're lucky and catch Tops on a slower night, you can convince Kevi to play a game of scrabble.  And if you're in the mood for something but can't find it, Matt is great at finding rares hidden away or can recommend something equally as delicious.  It's my favorite neighborhood bar.  Not every bar needs to serve food, especially when it is snuggled in next to good Thai and decent pizza that can be delivered to your table.

If you like steak this is the place to go!  I cringed when my partner asked for barbecue sauce to dip his filet in because the cuts are superior to any steakhouse I've ever been and cooked to perfection.  We also tried the scallops and they were cooked as well as the steak. The asparagus was also good.  Their shrimp cocktail was also super good.  Tip: save room for dessert! They have an awesome selection.

The view is absolutely breath taking! Watching the sunset over the mountains while having a decadent dinner was super romantic.  Chef Mel greeted our table and the service was superb. The servers were as excited talking about the food as we were to eat it.  We started with the foie gras. It was perfectly seared and the savoriness was nicely complimented by the sweetness of the peach pound cake and rhubarb chutney.  Next we got a seared scallop, compliments of the chef and servers. It's hard to find well executed scallops and these were superb! The sear on the outside had a nice crispness.  I had the Chilean sea bass. The kitchen definitely knows how to cook their fish. It was moist and flakey  with a good char. The potato risotto was on the cusp of being over seasoned but was silky and melted like butter.  My partner got the cut of the week which was a bone in filet. It was cooked to perfection. The squash and mole complimented it well. The lobster mac and cheese was made with havarti. It was deliciously creamy.  We got the chocolate soufflé for dessert. My partner really loved it. I am not a fan of chocolate but I can only imagine it's the stuff chocolate fanatics dream about.  Tip: during the summer go between six and seven to maximize the view. Watching the sky turn from blue to lavender to fire was awesome.

The service is what really made the experience.  The cocktails were a bit strong but flavorful.  Started with the grilled cheese, it lacked the crunch of a good grilled cheese but the tomato soup was so good. I wanted to lick the bowl.  The salmon was great. Loved the mushrooms and broth.  My partner had the Osso buco and it was fork tender, packed with flavor.  The asparagus stole the show on presentation and flavor. The orange wedges added a nice citrus and fresh element.  Had to try the bacon s'mores even though I'm not a chocolate fan. It was good but I don't think I appreciated it as much as most chocolate lovers.

Conveniently parked outside my place of employment, I decided to chose to eat at this food truck over the other three. My coworkers kept raving about the food and mason jar Rita mixes. I got the chicken quesadilla with the strawberry-mango. The quesadilla was loaded with chicken and nice and crispy on the outside. I wasn't a fan of the tortilla chips but the salsa was great. The drink was meh.

I went with the 3 course option and so did the partner.  The service was awkward.  Our server seemed distracted and didn't show much enthusiasm about the food.  It felt like he was trying super hard to be in the present but never really made us feel like he wanted to be there. The first "crudo" dishes were meh.  I had the albacore and it lacked flavor.  My partner had the ahi and it was much more palatable. I liked the crunch and acidity of the apple. For our second courses, I went with the raviolo and my partner went with a grilled mozzarella (which is not house made).  Both dishes were packed with flavor. I especially loved the dates pared with the cheese.  The quail ragu was excellent. I loved the added sweetness of the carrots.  The raviolo was good, however the yoke was overcooked so when I cut into it I didn't get the bright-yellow gooeyness I was anticipating.  I told my partner not to get the squid ink risotto, but he went against my judgement and got it.  The risotto looked like a bowl of motor oil.  He took three bites.  It tasted like poorly cooked tuna casserole.  I had the pork belly.  The flavor packed into the tomatoes was amazing.  Loved it.  However, the pork belly was not executed well.  There was no sear, no crispness, so it felt like eating pure fat. I ended up cutting off the top and just scraping the tomatoes off to eat with the meatier bits.  The crostada was a pleasant surprise.  My partner and I both agreed it was the best dessert we've had so far in our eating adventures.  The mixed cocktails were also wonderful.  We went with the Sun Also Rises and Grape Expectations (two of my favorite books).  I really wanted Crudo to work out, but there were just too many details missed.  It was not consistent. The service could definitely improve and while the food has all the elements of flavor implemented, they need to take more time to execute it well.

It was meh.  Didn't care for the moonshine cocktails. I swear if I had lit a match close to my lips I would have breathed fire.  The brisket was dry and too salty. the ribs were fork tender but also on the salty side.  The pulled pork tacos were good but the corn meal tortilla was too soft to eat like a true taco, unless you are okay with getting it to your mouth just to explode  all over your lap. I chose not to live dangerously and ate it with a knife and fork.   Service was really friendly.

The beginning was rough. Bad time of day to find parking. Had a reservation for inside but our table wasn't ready and had to sit outside. Don't get me wrong it was a super nice night to be sitting outside and they have a great patio but our chairs were wet from the downpour. If I were a witch, I'd have melted.  Want to get hammered? Order a mai Thai. Super strong.  Great wine menu.  Started with the foie gras. It was a nice change of pace from where we started. So delectable. And great presentation.  The duck with handmade pasta was good for a classic dish but it didn't wow me. My partners veal chop on the other hand was wowable and well seasoned. His Mac and cheese was packed with flavor and had a nice crispy top.  The blueberry Mochi was a superb finisher. Their ice cream comes from sweet republic which sold me immediately. Our server Chelsea was awesome. Gave good recommendations and told us the history of the neighborhood cat Kane. Any place that feeds a stray is an immediate favorite.

Went here twice in twenty four hours after finding out they serve brunch.  Our dinner was good. The bison was spectacular! And the bartender, Max, was extremely attentive. I was not a fan of the smoked salmon appetizer. It tasted of pure salt and needed something to break that up. The caviar on top was not doing it any favors. The dessert was more like a fruity breakfast. We had the dessert risotto.  Brunch on the other hand? It was busy because of Morhers Day and they couldn't seat us at a table but offered up the bar where there was no wait. Max remembered us from the night before, and immediately served us. The crab crepes were one of the best breakfast foods I've had in a long time.  Tip: get a patio table in the early morning or late evenings to take full advantage of the amazing scenery.

With all the kudos this place gets, I was super excited to find a good taco joint just down the street from home.  The service was ok. Standard counter service, though I did have to have another person help me check out because not all the cashiers speak English. That didn't really bother me, in fact it made me feel like I was in for a superb, authentic taco experience. Maybe I was hyping myself up, but I was really starting to look forward to inhaling the half dozen street tacos I ordered.  Instead, what I bit into was dry, underseasoned carne. Smh. The salsas were good. The carne, however, could not be salvaged. Beef jerky is more tender.  Next time I will try the potato goodness everyone raves about.

Great beer selection! I was told the food was great for bar food, but I think it could be better. I had a bacon pear grilled cheese. The bread didn't have the crunch I was looking for and the pear was not ripe :(  Love, love, love that they have sours on tap!!!

I was super excited to find this place nestled in downtown Phoenix.  Their specialty cocktails are superb. Had the squid for an appetizer and it was slightly overcooked but was packed with flavor.  The sushi was good quality and was as smooth as butter.  My primary complaint: way too much spice. Ordered three rolls and the lobster, I'm glad I ate the lobster first because I couldn't taste much after bites of the others. The partner and I ended up only have one to two pieces of each because of the heat overload.  Service was fantastic and the sushi chefs really know their stuff.

I love Chinese New Year. I was expecting a huge celebration with lots if dumplings and rice cake, but that's not what I got. The cultural events were also small and not what I'd expect from such a huge celebration.  The venders all sold similar materials and not many gave good insight into Chinese culture. It seemed more of a mish mash of stuff and seemed more Americanized than anything else. I mean they had a grilled cheese food truck of all things! The dragon dance was also subpar. The yo-yo man was more exciting.  It was a disappointment overall.

I'm amazed that people think the portions are small because I felt they were extremely generous.  The partner ordered the chicken katsu, which came with a large portion of the chicken over a lot of rice and salad.  The chicken was nice and crispy and the sauce was packed with flavor.  I liked the acidic sweetness to the sauce.  I ordered the squid salad, chef's special sashimi and kee's roll.  Squid salad is one of my favorite salads, I love the vinegar and crunch.  Sushi Kee did a great job on fulfilling my craving.   Of the sashimi, my favorite was the salmon with mango.  The salmon was super fresh and melted like butter and the mango complimented it surprisingly well.  I also loved the consistency and cut to the sashimi and sushi.  It was easy to eat, fresh, and delicious.  We got to Sushi Kee just as it was opening and had terrific service.  They were accommodating and friendly.  The partner and I believe we've found our new local sushi joint and are excited to try out everything else on the menu!
