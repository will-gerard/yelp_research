This botanical garden is really pretty! I tend to find the desert to be beautiful anyways, but if you're not quite sold that notion yet, I would recommend checking out this botanical garden and you'll see what I mean!   I loved the meandering trails and that EVERYTHING was labeled. Some even have fun facts as well, which made my self-guided tour much more enjoyable.   On the way in, I noticed a little stand in which they were selling wine and beer. Don't mind if I do! If it isn't too hot, I would recommend grabbing a glass of wine and strolling the trails. Did I just give you a great date suggestion?! I think so! You're welcome!  Definitely stop into the gift shop on your way out, also. Yes, they have your typical gift-shop gifts, but they also have beautiful artwork and lots of unique pieces for sale. I must have spent 20-30 minutes in there alone!

C'mon Yelpers! 4 stars?! No way, jose. This place is nothing special and I suggest, if you are looking for a nice local place to eat in Mesa, you MOVE ON! Initially we wanted to try the little bar next door, but being New Year's Day, it was closed so we settled for this place. We walked into a dingy looking restaurant with old, dusty pictures and knick-knacks nailed to the walls and when we were seated, our server was short with us as if they were about to close and she didn't want us there. We all ordered some beer and I opted for the mug to pour mine out of the bottle. When I received it, however, I opted not to pour it into the mug afterall  because it was so dirty and cloudy that the very thought of drinking out of it was repulsing.   I wasn't very hungry so I figured the potato skins would be a nice smaller meal but boy was I wrong! I was served 2 full sized russet potatoes, halved and carved out for the cheese and toppings. There was so much cheese on these potatoes that I literally had to take 3/4 of it off just to enjoy the potato itself. Also, they were so greasy that even in the short time we were sitting there the grease was piling up on top of the cheese. Did they even strain the bacon bits? I don't think so... Needless to say, I only ate one and lost my appetite. Also to be noted, the silverware was all spotty and looked like they hadn't seen the inside of a dishwasher/sanitizer in quite some time.  The only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because in our rush to get the heck out of there, I left my debit card on the table and the waitress chased us outside to return it. I was incredibly thankful for that!

This is a great way to spend an afternoon in Vegas! Especially if it is cold outside! It was a little shorter than I expected it to be, but that could be because I was a chicken and didn't go into the horror section! They have real people in there jumping out at you and I just wasn't feelin' it!   My friend and I got some sweet pictures with all kinds of celebrities including Hugh Hefner and Angelina Jolie. My favorite room was the musicians room. They had an employee in there waiting for people to walk in and when you would, he would ambush you and try to talk you into singing a karaoke duet with him. Super fun and really funny! Overall, had a great time! Not sure if I would go again anytime soon, but it is a definite must do, at least once, while you are in town!  Also, my friend and I were in town for a convention (Like a lot of Vegas tourists are these days!) and if you show your pass you get a super discounted rate!

I will give this place 5 stars when I actually have the opportunity to stay here! I have always wanted to because of it's perfect location on the strip and becuase some of my favorite places are located inside.   Sorry Venetian, sorry Paris, but New York, New York has the best themed indoor-but-you-feel-like-you-are-outdoors area! I just LOVE walking the streets, stopping for a hot dog or popping in to the dueling piano bar. Coyote Ugly is a great place for a more laid-back club experience (I say laid-back loosely... it's still a club-like atmosphere, just more laid back in comparison to, say, Tao or The Bank.) and the frozen drink vendor outside of it has the best bang-for-your-buck drinks- even better than Fat Tuesday! I also really enjoy the Nine Fine Irishmen bar, and, even though I do not enjoy sports of any kind, I even like the sports bar and grill.  NY, NY is a must-see casino when visiting Vegas. Don't pass it up!

This hotel is beautiful. Bottom line! Even though it is slowly becoming more and more outdated by all of the amazing new hotels and casinos popping up on the strip, the Ventetian is still holding its own! I have never actaully stayed at this hotel before, but I have walked through the casino and the shops about a dozen times and I will keep on going back!   In the shops, the singers on the gondolas are incredible. Their voices echo through the tunnels and their seemingly perfect pitch makes for a pleasant experience for everyone- not just those paying!  My first new experience in the Venetian was in the convention center. HOLY COW! That place is seriously a maze of underground tunnels and rooms! It is very overwhelming! Strap on your tracking devices before entering this thing!

If you're searching Yelp right now trying to find a place to grab brunch, look no further! Come to ZuZu! You'll dine in mid-century modern style, be entertained by live music, enjoy the outdoor patio and feel like you're on vacation on some tropical island somewhere.   Once you're seated, you'll enjoy warm, complimentary chocolate chip scones, and they are SO good! The chocolate is all melty and I'm pretty sure I tasted a hint of cherry in there. We ordered coffee and champagne because, why not?! The coffee was VERY strong and I only ended up drinking about a half of my cup. We sprung for the Moet vintage rose which was de-lish!   Even though the menu is very concise, it was very difficult for me to choose what to order. Everything looked so good! I settled on the Eggs Benedict and opted for the cheese grits. The bene was cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was amazing. But, those cheese grits were to die for! And I'm not typically a grits kind of girl.   Our service was just alright. We think our server had our table, which was located at the very back of the dining room by the kitchen, as well as some tables all the way out on the front of the patio, so sometimes she would be around, but mostly, she was not. Also, as she was pouring the last of our champagne, she poured the entire remains in to one person's glass, instead of splitting it evenly among the three of us (like you're supposed to) and claimed that the bottle was so heavy she didn't realize it was almost gone. Rookie move. And definitely frustrating since we forked out quite a bit of dough for that bottle.  I definitely hope to come back to ZuZu the next time I'm in town, though!

This is one of my most favorite bars to hang out in while in Vegas! It is always fun with dancing, flare bartenders, mason jars, and birthday "shots".   I actually prefer to come here during the day because most of the bartenders are really personable and you get a really cool show while they throw bottles around and pour 20 shots at a time in a pyramid. They are able to talk with you moer and spend more time showing off their cool tricks than they are at night when it is super busy. AND they still play the Toby Keith song, "I Love This Bar" during the day- which means free shots!   I keep coming back to this place despite the fact that I am not that big into country music and I absolutely despise Toby Keith. So, that really says something about how fun this bar is!  Last note, go on your birthday and order the birthday shot. Trust me :)

I love this bar. It is always full of people and the music is spot on, authentic. It's a good thing the atmosphere is so amazing though because this place does have a few downsides.  First one- there is a cover charge which is odd for a bar. I understand that there is a live band playing... but still. It's not a night club. Although, a little tip for the military- show your ID and you get in for free. Even dependents!  Second one- the drinks are ridiculously expensive! Ok, I know it's a bar in Vegas, so it is to be expected to a certain extent, but $11 beers?? And I'm not talking Guiness, I'm talking Coors! Yikes!  Third one- lack of seating. The layout of this place is really awkward and hard to navigate. It is fairly narrow and situated so that most seats can get at least a small view of the band playing on stage. I don't know about you other ladies out there, but I am usually walking the strip in heels and dying for a place to sit down with my beer.  My favorite thing about this place?? You can't smoke inside! It is one of the few bars that I know of that I can actually breathe in! Ultimately, this is a destination bar. You come here to stay here for the night not just pass through and I love it.

I have been to this little place twice now and I have equally enjoyed myself each time. It could be because both times I was a little bit drunk and it was 4AM and "Oh my god, this is the best meal I have ever had!" Ok, so it probably wasn't the best I have EVER had, but at the time it was perfect.   I always get the over-easy eggs with french fries... Uh.. remember that last part when I said I was drunk? Don't judge! Drunk or not, it is delicious and totally hits the spot! Also, I have never had bad service here. My water glass was constantly being refilled (Wonder why?!) and the servers are very good at pretending they don't hear the ridiculous conversations you are having.   The only bad thing about this restaurant is the price. It is to be expected in Vegas I suppose, but for the type of food they sell- general American fare- it is definitely over-priced. Therefore, I give this place 4 stars. And when I am drunk in Vegas again, I will definitely be back to this little gem!

Ok, Vegas- this casino should be next on your death list (if it isn't already). I have never stayed here (I never would) but I have certainly walked through while passing by on the strip. And even in my most drunken stupors I have felt a little less than comfortable sitting on the old, stained casino chairs. Walking on the carpet inside is like a death wish in heels- strings pulled up, cigarette burn holes, etc. Not too mention how loud it is and the strange addition of beer pong which, to me, comes off as a feeble attempt to get the younger crowd in. This place just screams, "Hurry! Someone tear me down and start me over!" Perhaps the older crowd likes this place because it is sentimental. It has been around for a while and with all of the re-vamping the strip has had the last decade, it is a sight of familiarity and perhaps even some fond memories. BUT, times change, right?   The best thing about this casino is that you can't get lost in it- you always know where the nearest exit back to the strip is!

We found this place on Yelp as we were visitors from out of town and desperately needed a car wash. When you pull up an attendant comes to your window and reviews the options with you and tries to upsell you on everything from vaccuuming to waxing. He even threw in the old cheesy sales tactic, "Normally it costs this much, but today I will give it to you for half off." Sure... whatever. You could easily spend over $100 on a car wash here. Not that it wouldn't be worth it- they do a good job, but it was just not what we were in the market for. The good news is, he wasn't too pushy and actually took, "No thanks" for an answer.   The inside waiting area is fully equipped with a huge convenience store that bordered on grocery store. Everything was really clean and well organized and the staff seemed friendly enough. There is even a waiting area with couches and TV monitors displaying the different areas of the car wash so that you could monitor the work being done on your car. Another plus- they were open on New Years Day!

We came for dinner with my almost 2 year old nephew and our waitress was awesome about it. She intuitively knew that the duration of our meal would consist of trying to keep him happy and offered up some crayons she managed to scrounge up as well as some printer paper leftover from the office. So sweet! After taking care of the toddler, she took care of our wine order and made some excellent suggestions for us.    We ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer and may have overstepped a bit -- those things are huge. But, SO delicious! I think we tried 8 different kinds? I seriously lost track. We also got the fried artichokes and they are awesome. I highly recommend you order them! For dinner, I did the 'create your own' pasta. I have to say, I'm a sucker for 'create your own' anything because I know I can get everything exactly the way I like it. I went with the Fettuccine Alfredo and added meatballs. It was so good!   Overall, I really like this place! The back patio was great to sit and listen to the live music while we dined and our service and food were both excellent. The one thing I will say is that the inside decor could use a bit of updating. It feels pretty outdated in there and the bedazzled waiter uniforms feel a little tacky.

It is practically impossible to walk by this place on the strip when wandering Vegas. The drinks just call to you in all of their poisonous deliciousness. If you really want to be knocked on your butt, get the 190 Octane. It tastes delicious, but be warned it is stronger than it tastes! I like to save these puppies for day drinking/shopping while in Vegas so I have time to sleep it off before dinner. :)  The drinks are reasonably priced and the portions are generous. Also, the extra shots are dirt cheap- which may or may not be a good thing! All of their glasses are souvenir style so you always have a friendly reminder sitting on your bar shelf at home of the day you blacked out on the strip of Las Vegas.

AH! This place is AMAZING! I literally wanted to eat here everyday, and pretty much did! They have one of the best menus I have ever seen. Everything from breakfast served all day to sweet potato tots to Dorito encrusted mac and cheese. There were so many crazy, ecclectic things on the menu that I literally wanted to order one of everything just to say that I have had it!   I ordered the bacon and egg grilled cheese and it was heavenly! Everything was cooked perfectly and it got me wondering why I don't make these bad boys at home! Also, their french fries are delicious and perfectly crispy.   The atmosphere is that of your typical sports bar and the service is just fine. It's the menu options alone that are earning all 5 stars for me in this review!

Thank you Yelp for introducing me to this sweet little hot spot in Vegas! While doing a restaurant search for my surrounding area this place popped up with 4 stars and over 500 reviews. So I thought, "500 people can't be wrong, right?" And I was right!   Once we got into the Cosmopolitan we had to ask someone how to get there because there are literally no signs- not even on the outside. So for future reference, you go up to the 3rd level on the escalator. Once you get off the escalator there is a weird tube-looking elevator directly in front of you. Then, just to the right of that is an inconspicuous little hallway- it's in there! Follow your nose!  This pizza is crispy thin and the slices are HUGE! I had 2 slices and it was plenty! They also have this really yummy white pizza made with lots of yummy cheeses. I would say this is the top 3 best pieces of pizza I have ever had and I have been to New York AND Chicago!   The only bad part is this place is real tiny and there isn't much room to sit. Other than that, GO! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!

Even in my middle of the night, drunken, starving state, I could not bring myself to enjoy this food. They have a limited late night menu and must have the 'B' team in the back learning how to cook it all up in the back.   My fries were really soggy and not cooked all the way through and I couldn't bring myself to eat hardly any of them. Also, at the food pick-up counter, the lady was a real nazi. If you didn't have your receipt, you weren't getting your food. No exceptions. I get it, people can just walk up and grab whatever they want, but I only get it to a point. It seems to work out OK for places like In-N-Out. And really, who cares?? Everyone is drunk anyways!   My husband and my cousin were also not impressed with their food which was made evident the next morning when we had tons of food leftover to throw out.

I came here for a late night dinner with my sister on my last visit to Scottsdale. First off, the ambiance is cool. It's dark and has very chic decor.   I ordered the wine they had on tap that day which was really good. I would recommend getting (or at least trying) what they have on tap. There aren't very many places that do it! For food, we got the cheese board (which is gigantic and full of amazing meats and cheeses). We also shared the focaccia which was nothing short of AMAZING. It had mascarpone cheese on top and was drizzled with honey. Need I say more?  We each ordered a different pasta dish and ended up sharing. Everything was SO good! Our server was great and very friendly. He made some great wine recommendations for us and quickly cleared our table of the seemingly endless parade of dishes we went through that night. This is a restaurant I will request to visit again on my next trip to Scottsdale.

Such a cool place! I've never been anywhere like Butterfly Wonderland before. It felt like a tropical forest in there! There was the heat, the humidity, being surrounded by greenery and then, of course, the exotic butterflies fluttering about!  I will admit, it took me some getting used to. I typically flinch at things flitting about. And let me tell you, they flit! But they are gorgeous and they are so interesting to watch and admire (surprisingly enough). We noticed that if you are wearing colorful clothing and you sit on the benches, butterflies will land on you. It's pretty fun, actually.   I was super intrigued by the really cool exhibit right at the entrance of the wonderland rainforest. It shows you each step of the transformation process from caterpillar to butterfly. Super cool! And, on the way out, they have a cool room with big aquariums and some sweet fish. There's also a pool in the middle where you can pet the sting-rays. Not sure if this will stay once the aquarium opens up next door, but I think it should!   I actually found a few cute items at the gift shop and I genuinely enjoyed my visit. What a fun place to spend an afternoon with the family!
