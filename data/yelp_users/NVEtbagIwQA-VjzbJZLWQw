I saw a movie here a few weeks ago and had a fun time. I like that there is a place in town to see indipendant films on the big screen that you don't see in the other theaters. The attendants behind the counter were nice and seemed happy to serve up my drink - sometimes at other theaters they can seem unhappy to be there. Since this is a Harkins, bring your loyalty cup and have some of their warm buttery popcorn.

I enjoy an evening hanging around desert ridge, but not when it's as hot outside as it is now. The splash pad looks like fun for kids. The AMC is nice and has an IMAX screen. The Yard House makes a good burger to enjoy before or after your movie, and you can stop in at one of the retail stores such as target, or kohls. I relate to how nice outdoor malls are 6 or 7 months per year. Its just really hot outside in the summer and sometimes cold in the winter months.

I like going to total wine to stock up my fridge with the best priced wine and beer around. Good luck trying to find your drinks for less someplace else. Forget BevMo and go to total wine, its worth the extra few miles if its out of your way. I'm definitely a fan and will only shop here when looking to replenish my stocks.

Mojo in city center is great! All fresh ingredients, clean froyo machines, and tasty yogurt! 'nuff said.

I don't particularly enjoy spending as much on pizza as Picazzo's likes to charge. I find their pizzas tasty but small for the price. Ordered one pizza for 4 people we ended up spending about $30 and all left hungry. No thanks picazzo's maybe I'll just order pizza hut next time.

I was at brat haus late last week and really enjoyed the pretzels and cheese, the chicken and waffles, the beer, and the service was great also. I was here for happy hour also, and did enjoy their great food at a great price. I'll be coming back for more of those pretzels, and soon.
