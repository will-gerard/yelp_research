So, after a night out my friends and I played it safe and took a taxi home, leaving my car by Acme. The next morning, I had several appointments to attend to, and thus I called yellow cab to get a ride back to my car. I called at 9:50 am on Wednesday morning. When my cab hadn't showed up by 10:20, I called to find out what's up, and was told that the taxi hadn't been dispatched yet. Like, really? 30 minutes? Really? Its not like its sunday morning, its wednesday! She apologized and said it would be ten minutes. I'm now in a time crunch. 15 more minutes go by...it's now been 45 minutes since I ordered the taxi! I could have walked there by now! I called another cab company all together, and they showed up in 3 minutes. 3. I cancelled my cab with yellow cab and will never call them again.

So whenever I have had a hankering for sushi in the past, I always wound up in old town at Ra or Stingray...or one of the other 20 sushi joints within 10 feet of one another. That, and I always wound up paying an arm and a leg for sushi. Not so with Sakana! A good friend let me in on this place, as it is kind of hidden in a strip mall. Yelp helped me find it :) Anyhow, I  am a yellowtail sashimi kind of girl, and I must say that Sakana has great quality. I also found that the staff was very flexible- they even made my friend and I things that arent even on the menu. Amazing. That, is above and beyond the call of duty.

Okay, so I'm not sure how people have not had a great experience at Brueggers! Originally I am from Michigan, and there is a Brueggers right down the street from my house. That being said, I went there a lot! Then, I moved out to Phoenix and I found that the nearest Brueggers to me is actually quite far. Thats my only complaint. Its not close enough. Everytime I go, the staff is very accomodating and super friendly. All of their bagels and cream cheese are freshly made, and they have product for sale as well. I honestly have never had a problem at Brueggers, and I am surprised that other people have!

I love The Crown Room. I've had multiple wonderful experiences at Crown. The staff is laid back and they are pro's at what they do, as evidenced by good drinks :). I love that it doesn't have that club-y atmosphere like the rest of old town, and the music is different each night. There is plenty of lounge seating, and space to dance, as well as private bathrooms. All in all, its a good time at The Crown Room.

As if it isnt obvious, I am a huge fan of the Crown Room. Honestly, my friends and I have had some epic nights there. I decided that I needed to write a little update on the Crown Room because this past weekend I learned something new about Crown. New you say? I mean, after 30-some check-ins what else could I have missed?  The White Cosmo.   Hello delicious :) This is a house recipe and a refreshing twist on the original. I couldn't tell you what exactly is in it...but its tasty without murdering your taste buds with sugar. And the dried cranberries are a nice touch too. Rumor has it that you get real cranberries around holiday time...  Essentially, it is imperative that you take yourself up to Crown Room and try one. You will more than likely find me at the bar.   Cheers :)

A good friend of mine and I went out for a bit on Saturday, and decided to stop by after hearing the music coming from Pita House! Im so happy we stopped in, because I was craving Tzatsiki!  The food was good, and cheap! The pita tasted really fresh :) Aside from that they had a belly dancer performing and the hookah bar was really busy. A group of people also came through and were doing some kind of traditional dance that was really cool to see.  Great vibe, energy and food. Ill definately be back.

I've been to Kaz a few times now, and I gotta say that it's really hit or miss. It seems to be alright if you go during the week, but not so much during the weekend. It get's really busy on the weekends, which is great, but the staff is simply clueless on how to handle a busy night.   Upon arriving on a Friday night, I am greeted by a man that I cannot see because it's so dark. Ok, ok, I get it, speakeasy and what have you. I still want to be able to make good eye contact with my potential server however. Anyhow, I inform him that I am the first of the five of us that are going arrive. He mentioned that it's going to be a wait for a table, and I informed him that I will wait up at the bar if he would please put our name in for a table.   I get up to the bar, wherein the bartender passes me 3 times before even looking at me. He even stopped to help the couple next to me and still didn't even say hello.The couple next to me said "Wow,  that's strange, he must not be feeling well or something tonight because he is usually so friendly...". The couple then assisted me by flagging him down wherein the bartender finally handed me a wine list and food menu.   The wine list is obviously extensive, and the food menu offers great options as well. Again, the bar was busy, and since the bartender was oh-so-helpful the first time around I decided to just pick a wine and go with it. I went with a cheese plate and a glass of Cotes Du Rhone, and at this point the other folks I was waiting on joined me and ordered a drink at the bar. 30 minutes later, our table was finally ready, and so we sat down.   After finishing what we ordered at the bar, it took over an hour to get through another round, and at that point we were all over the Kaz experience. Normally we would have stayed and ate/drank more but the amount of time spent waiting on our server to come by was unacceptable. We asked for the bill, and I actually started the stopwatch on my phone. It took the server 15 minutes to go to the machine, print our bill and bring it back. Yikes.

My best friend and I just experienced drift for the first time on Saturday, and we had a great time! We had the spinach artichoke dip, and it was to die for. Absolutely delicious, and it was only $5 or somewhere in that neighborhood. The bartenders were nice, and they were on top of their game- my best got drink refills without having to say anything, which doesnt happen often in old town. The decor was a little over the top, but the fire place was key :) If you go in, ask if Snyder is working at the bar. He was cool.

I have been eating at Don and Charlies since I was about four or five, and I have yet to be disappointed.  Recently, they have made additions to the menu including the burger bar menu and they have also opened for lunch. Both good things :).   My best friend, Mandy, and I went there last night for dinner...and it was fabulous. Mandy happens to work there as well, so if you go in then you should ask for Amanda. Anyhow, last night...usually when I go to D and C, I wind up getting red meat. Duh. The prime rib is to die for, as well as the Skirt Steak. However, I decided to change it up last night, and go for the Salmon. GOOD CHOICE on my part. Absolutely delicious! I also got a side of au gratin potatoes...they are so good I want to like, bathe in them or something.   The manager came by the table and when I complimented the Salmon he informed me that it was just flown in fresh this morning. In fact, most all of the waitstaff came by to say hello. I mean, I know I have been going there a long time, but I still think its nice that they take a second to come and chat. So aside from the friendly waitstaff and managers, you are also presented with incredibly fresh and tasty food. My kind of place.

Came to Ra last week with my sister, and I've been to Ra several times. Over the past few months I have noticed it is definitely not as full as it used to be. The music was up awkwardly loud for a tuesday night, especially given that there wasn't very many people in the place. Anyhow my sister and I sat down and ordered a yellowtail appetizer and a few drinks, and then she ordered a few rolls while I stuck with the sashimi plate that I usually get.   The appetizer was really good, yellowtail in a garlic/soy sauce of sorts with some green onions shaved on top. When my sashimi arrived, I could tell from the smell of the platter that the sashimi was borderline fresh, and after taking a bite of the salmon I informed the waitress that it wasn't really up to par. After conferring with the chefs, the waitress came back to inform me that the fish was fresh and cut this morning, but that she's happy to take it off of the bill since anything else I order will be taken off the same fish. So instead of offering another option, she walks away and leaves me with a bowl of rice.   Needless to say I wound up walking down the street to another restaurant after my sister finished her roll to eat something.

Last nite, the whole family and I got together and went to the grapevine. It was my first time, and I will say that the service started out slow. That irritated me at first, but as the night went on I realized that it was kind of refeshing not to be in a rush.  We ordered a few bottles of wine, and got a lavosh, sauteed chicken strips, and chili. The chili had a weird after taste to it, but the lavosh and the chicken strips were great! The lavosh was made with Dolfino cheese and Cajun chicken, which proved to be a great combination. I loved that the chicken was not dried out either :)  After eating, my family and I joined in on some karaoke that was already going on...and we had a great time! There appears to be a set of regulars, which makes for a lively crew.

My family and I just became members at the Scottsdale Athletic Club and Resort...and I am NOT disappointed about it at all! What a great place. The work out facility is nice, well equipped, and quiet. No one to stare at you while you work out and no waiting for machines to free up. The facilities to shower and get ready after your workout are awesome! They provide you with hair styling products and everything just in case you forget to bring yours. My sister and my mom tried out the tennis courts, and said that they had a great time doing so. I cant wait to try one of their exercise classes!  The Resort side of this place is nothing short of beautiful. I had family in from out of town, and they got a suite for a few days. It was gorgeous! Complete witha kitchen, fireplace, TV area, bedroom and bathroom. The pool is also very nice, and you can even order food to the poolside tables.   Overall, we had a great experience at the Scottsdale Athletic Club and Resort, and I still have a lot of things to try-out as a member. Looking forward to the next wine tasting :)

So on Christmas Eve, my mom usually cooks. However for the first time in family history, this year, we decided to go out. My folks frequent Veneto fairly often, and so we decided it'd be a good choice. Seriously? Best choice ever. We started out with an order of salmon carpaccio. Yes. You should order this when you go, because its sooooo good. I had the Filetto Al Porcini...it was a special...phenominal. In my family we believe in sharing when it comes to food, so I also tried the Sole, Sea Bass, and Arribiata. Delish. It was pretty busy in the restaurant, but the staff didn't seem to break a sweat. The servers/managers that know my parents even made time to come over and hang out for a bit. The owner and much of the staff are from italy, so you know its the real deal. I loved my experience at Veneto, and will definately be going back for more.

I came to FEZ for a birthday party, and was quite pleased really. The decor was very modern, and the restaurant had a good vibe to it. There was a party of about 20 of us, and they had no problem accommodating seating arrangements.   I had a glass of cava, and the hummus and was a very happy girl. We passed around a few other appetizers and drinks, and everyone seemed to enjoy the experience. Dessert was a delicious piece of tiramisu.   The only down side was that it took forever to get my bill. I mean unusually long. I worried that the gorgeous waiter had taken off with my card to go shopping or something. Other than that, it was a fantastic time!

I had lunch with a friend at stingray this past sunday, after we figured out that most sushi places are not open until 4pm on sunday. Stingray has a trendy decor to go with a variety of trendy cocktails. One thing i have noticed about several sushi places is that they always have a plethora of specialty cocktails! At any rate, my friend and I ordered the wild salmon roll, the las vegas roll and the moto rolla. The moto rolla was absolutely my favorite! Its a cucumber wrapped roll with yellowtail, salmon and avocado. SO SO good! The las vegas roll and the wild salmon did not disappoint either. The fish itself seemed to be fresh, and the price point wasnt outrageous either. Ill definitely be back :)

I have only been to My Big Fat Greek twice, but already the bartender and the manager remember my name. The first time I came in, I'd had a long day at work and just wanted a salad and some saganaki. I was not disappointed at all! The dressing on the salad is absolutely perfect, not to oily and not to acidic either. Trust me when I say, however, that the small salad is plenty for one person or possibly even two people to have.   The restaurant iself is eclectically decorated and cozy. Each time I have been in, everyone is in a good mood and you wind up making friends with not only the servers, but the other patrons as well. A very friendly vibe.

Recently I found myself in the MAC store, hoping to get inspired for a new "look". I decided to leave it to a professional, and thus I was given an appointment with a makeup artist. I believer her name is Yeldis, and she is fabulous! Yeldis has a very good eye for color palettes that compliment all kinds of skin tones, and she showed me how to use products that were new to me. Also, I learned that MAC has a "recycle your containers" program where you bring in your empty containers and they give you an eyeshadow or lip color for every six containers you bring in. Looks like I will be back!

I was driving down the freeway a few days ago, when a pebble flew off a pick up truck and cracked my windsheild. Its just a tiny crack thank goodness, but I decided that I better fix it fast before it becomes a problem.   So, I grab my phone and call my insurance guy, Chris Roden, and he picks up on the first ring. Chris is always attentive and positive whenever I talk to him, and today was no different. He reminded me of the policy I have (which includes a discount for having both renter and auto insurance!) and stated that they are able to send someone to me free of charge. And oh, by the way, there will be no charge for the services either. Yay! With a girl as busy as me, its a huge relief to know that they will send someone by my office to fix up my windsheild while I work. He got me on the line with the young lady in the claims department and in less than 20 minutes I had an appointment set to fix my windsheild.   Beautiful. Aboslutely Yelp-worthy.

I cannot believe I have been so delinquent in writing a review about this place! They have a location near 46th St. and Indian School that I frequent pretty often, and it must be said: their food is phenominal and you MUST try it.   Being from Detroit, I am a die-hard coney and cheese fry fan. I have NEVER been able to find really good chili-cheese fries out here in the valley....until now :) Yes! Chicago Gyro is my answer to amazing chili-cheese fries in the Valley. Their fries have this wonderful seasoning on them, and the chili-cheese is the CLOSEST i have found to Coney chili-cheese. Thats absolutely a feather in their cap.   Aside from the amazing chili-cheese fries, I am also a fan of their dolmadas, and I usually order them together. In fact, I have ordered them together so many times, that the nice guy named Brian at the counter knows when I call because im apparently the only one that puts these two things together. Seriously! I'll call ahead to order for lunch and this is usually how the conversation goes:   Brian: "Chicago Gyros, this is Brian" Me: "I'd like an order for carry-out....one order of chili-cheese fries with the chili and the cheese on the side, and one order of dolmadas" Brian: "Oh hey Brit hows it going. Ill have that ready for you in ten".  He knows EVERY time. Its now gotten to the point where I can call and after he picks up I can just say "Its Brit" and then he tells me that my order will be ready in ten. Love it.   Ive also had their hummus, their gyro, and their greek salad....all wonderful choices. Everything is served fresh, and you never have to wait too long or pay too much.   Great food, great staff....many more visits to come from me.

My review for over easy is seriously delinquent...but hey...better late than never right? I will start by saying that every time I come in to Over Easy I feel like part of the family. The staff, as well as the owners are always in a good mood, but at the same time no one is ever "fake-nice". Sometimes I come across a wait at the restaurant, however it never feels like the wait is long.  I've had several different menu items, but my favorite is always the pancakes. I know, I know, simple but delicious!! I've never had a bad food experience here and thus every time I show up I know it's going to be good. Also, please note the coffee. I am a coffee-aholic, so good coffee in a joint is important to me and they definately have it. Always good, and always fresh.   The restaurant itself is small, with only a few tables inside, a patio and the counter by the register. What I love about Over Easy is that its laid back. Over easy is not trying to be trendy or pretentious in any way. It's breakfast people, let's not make this too complicated before noon.

I was sitting at my desk at work, and right about 5pm I began to crave pizza. So on my way home, I decided that instead of opting for delivery, that I would treat myself to some delicious gourmet pizza. Alas, I came across humble pie....  Upon walking in I was greeted by two friend hostesses, who informed me that they are owned by the same person as 5th and Wine. My pulse immediately quickened based on past experience, but I decided to stay and give it a whirl. I am SO glad I did!  The place is pretty cozy and the pizza ovens are open to the restaurant. Since it was just me, I decided to sit up at the bar by the pizza ovens where you can watch the chefs make the pizza.   I ordered the assorted olives to get things started, which are really tasty, and then I ordered a goat cheese pizza. All of the ingredients tasted very fresh, and the crust was perfect! I didn't feel like I was too full from the crust, and it showcased the main ingredients very well. Overall it was a great pick. I fully intend on enjoying some wine as well as a few of their other menu options next time I stop in.

A few nights ago I was really craving some good sashimi and I happened to wander by Geisha. Being that it was just me, I sat up at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and attentive, and he even made me a delicious bellini which is not on the menu by the way. I ordered the yellowtail sashimi as well as the salmon sashimi and both of these fish came out very fresh and flavorful.   The decor in this place is very cool! Its a small space, but they use the space well including a patio and a private karaoke room. And the bathrooms...how do I explain the bathrooms...let's just say the toilet has options. Yes. Options for your bathroom experience. Overall, it was a good time, and I will definitely be back with friends.

The first time I went to La Bocca was with my good friend Kim. She and I met up there and had a very....off experience. Our waiter seemed new and seemed very flustered. He told us the kitchen was SUPER busy...despite the fact that the restaurant was barely half full. Anyways, I came back with Kim and friends for her birthday this past weekend, and I am SO glad I did! Here goes:  Atmosphere: We all know Mill Ave can get a little wild, and quite a mish mosh of folks on saturday night. So, that being said when I walked into La Bocca I felt that the environment was very cool and sophisticated, while still being young.   Drinks: $5 sangria and a pitcher for $18? Sign me up. Everyone at the table drank sangria save for one couple that ordered Bells....which is a delicious beer out of K-zoo Michigan :). Anyhow, everyone enjoyed the rojo sangria.   Food: Hello deliciousness! I had the chopped salad and a truffle mushroom pizza. I ate the entire salad which had little tubetti pastas, bacon, blue cheese crumbles and a phenominal dijon vinagrette. The pizza....dear diary I am in love with this pizza. Mozzarella, goat cheese, mushrooms, truffle oil, tomato, fresh spinach....literally slices of heaven in my mouth. I ate all but two slices. Thats way more than anyone my size should ever eat. Must do that again.   The server: he was cool and seemed to have no problem handling the whole table of us. He even brought Kim carmel ice cream with a candle. A trick candle at that. Kudos my man.   Overall, we had a great time at La Bocca, and despite the strange experience the first time around i'll definately be returning.

I am fairly new to the gluten free and paleo lifestyle due to a medical condition, so dining out has been tough. Alas, after work I searched for gluten free restaurants and this place came up. Granted, I eat meat and this place is veggie/vegan, I decided to give it a whirl anyhow. I'm SO happy I did!   This place is a small, casual spot that is connected to a tea shop, and upon entry it smells fantastic. Upon looking at the menu, the items are veggie, can be made vegan, and many can be made gluten free or paleo. I got the white gnocchi which is naturally all three of those things. It. Was. Insanely. Delish. The sauce was so decadent, and the sweet potato gnocchi were just the right texture and flavor. I was seriously blown away, I never thought I could enjoy a vegan Alfredo sauce, but boy was I wrong! Apparently vegan cheese sauces are largely comprised of cashews...who knew? It's fantastic and way healthier than the dairy counterpart.   After eating dinner I indulged a little in a truffle for dessert. Alas, this was also vegan, paleo and gluten free. It was a mocha cream truffle and it was phenomenal. I never would have even guessed it was made any different than a regular truffle. Needless to say, I  am so exited about this place; it's been an experience that has shown me that my food experiences don't have to be restrictive though my recent necessary change in diet is!   After all is said and done, they bring you fennel seed as a digestif. How cool is that? Reminded me of Fernet only it's not booze. Sober, clean, and healthy....I couldn't have asked for more.

Alright W, I've got bones to pick. I've been a customer at the W several times, and it seems like every time I go there is some kind of issue. Whether it's with the room, or whether its with how many guests we are permitted to have at our very expensive table...there's always something. When I come to the W, I expect to spend money. No complaints about that, I know that when I head to the W that I am going to drop some dough on whatever it is we are doing. Got it. What I don't understand is the sub-par customer service for a place that spouts "Whatever, Whenever". For example, My friends and I purchased a table in the night club. There was only three of us at the table, and we got constantly heckled by the door people and the management about the rest of our party showing up who were in another vehicle. Im sorry, but 3 people to a bottle of champagne and a bottle of vodka?! We would have been absolutely hammered. Furthermore, there were only 3 other guests that were looking to join us. It's not like I invited 10 more people, but they seriously wanted to get into it with me over a total of 6 guests at this table in their nightclub. Hello? Are you serious? Any other nightclub in Scottsdale would have happily accommodated 6 guests to a table.  Not to mention that aside from purchasing the table, my other friend also purchased a room for the night. The W has a very nice decor, and a great selection of alcohol and food, but again the management of the place is not up to par for the prices you are paying.

I had my first sidebar experience a few nights ago and I enjoyed it! It has a cozy yet chic atmosphere, without the elitist attitude that can be found in other establishments. They also have a pretty decent menu, which comes in handy around happy hour :). The only issue i had was that there is not much space and thus, i was constantly excusing myself and climbing over others in order to move. Other than that, well done Sidebar.

How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge? Sheesh! I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge. The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with. It is a dish of fantastic, cheesy wonderfulness. Also, please note the veggie wrap. HOLY SMOKES. Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies, feta cheese, and some kind of lemon/herb/heaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita! Really? Really Aaron May?  The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff, and comfortable setting. It's decorated all rustic and cushy, and true to form there are antler-chandeliers. You will also find pool tables, darts, several TV's, jenga, bean bag games...they have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained. Check it out...

Karve is a completely different work out than any other work out I have ever tried. I've taken pilates, various dance classes, kickboxing, self defense, cycling...the list goes on. Karve gives me the best work out of any of those classes I just listed. Karve combines multiple forms of exercise, such as ballet and pilates, into a work out that will challenge you for SURE. Some of the moves are done with free weights, some with a ball, and some at the barre. Alli is the instructor that I enjoy the most, because she is encouraging without being peppy and annoying. She will challenge you, without being harsh. She's great basically. The studio itself is very nice, with bathrooms, a private shower and changing room. Daycare is provided during some of the class times, which is specified on their website. They also offer a small retail section, which has some great looking work out clothes. That being said, im hooked on Karve.

Mmmmmmm deliciousness. Dutch Bros Coffee is sooooooo good. Furthermore, the staff is totally cool. Its as if they just know that you are miserable about being awake at 6am going to work, and they want to make you smile.   I am in love with "The Kicker"- espresso and irish cream. My only qualm is that they don't have a wide variety of food options...i believe just a few pastry items. So while the coffee is absolutely fantastic, you might want to eat before/after you come to Dutch Bros.

My mom, my sisters and I came to Petite Maison last night for dinner after a day of work. It's such a cute little place, and rings true to the style of so many restaurants I visited while living in France. It got a little confusing with our server however, who left us with another server for a little while, and then came back at the end of the meal.   We started out with a cheese plate and an order of escargot, which was a perfect appetizer...just enough to get the taste buds going but not too much to make you feel full already. Next we all passed around the salade maison, as well as the salad special and a bowl of french onion soup. The salade maison was good, however I felt that the chevre lacked its typical flavor and was somewhat bland instead. On the flip side, both the onion soup and the salad special were phenonimal.   My mom and my sister had the fish for two, which was a full Loup de Mer with potatoes and haricots verts. Both of them said it was fantastic, especially the meat from under the gills. I had the pork tenderloin with leeks, brussel sprouts and apple cider reduction...it was absolutely delicious. They cook the pork medium, so there is still a tad of pink and its nice and juicy. I have the other half of the meal in my fridge and cannot wait to have that again! My twin sister got the roasted chicken with oyster stuffing and truffles and was not dissappointed in the least. For dessert we shared the chocolate creme brulee, which if the name itself doesnt give away its heavenly nature, the taste certainly will.

I come into buzzberry several times weekly and have yet to have a bad experience.   The atmosphere: I love coming into buzzberry because it is kind of an off-beat place. There is artwork from locals for sale on the walls, random books to read, and you can even bring in your own coffee mug to leave on site. Also, the staff members there always greet you with a smile.   The food: The breakfast wraps are pretty good, although I wish they had more varieties for cheese in their breakfast wrap. The cinnamon scone is my favorite, and its even better toasted. Ive also had their tuna salad at lunch which was simple but delish.   The drinks: Hellooooo good coffee. I like strong coffee, but often times strong coffee can come off bitter as well. Not so here. Strong and smooth! Also, their smoothies are fabulous...I go for the strawberry-acai smoothie every time. I have now refer to this smoothie as the Magic Strawberry Acai because I just feel so much better about life after having it. Another note: you can get a frequent drinker card where you buy 3 coffees or 3 smoothies and get the next one free! Perfect :).

My brother and I came to 5th and Wine once, and it was pretty decent...especially the fried pickles...so when I was on a date and my date informed me he hadnt been to 5th and Wine yet, I suggested we go for a drink. Oh my word. What a heinous experience transpired next. We were treated like criminals, and my date never got his drink. Here goes:  So we walk in and find some seats at the bar, and take a look at the menu. The bartender came over and informed us of a new date-night promotion they are running, and then left us to the menu. When she came back, I ordered the LaFitte brut and my date asked her "How is your sangria?" and the bartender responded "red or white?" and he then said "red". And then the bartender walked away. My date and I looked at each other very confused. Then we figured, the bartender must not have heard him correctly yada yada...anyhow, my date mentioned that they allegedly have this great patio yada yada and asked if I would join him on the patio for a moment so he could check it out. So I look at the bartender, and make eye contact, and point towards the patio to signal her that we were going outside for a second, and she nods in understanding. We get out to the patio and we were chatting for a moment when the manager comes out and asks "is everything ok?". She looked at me like I was doing something wrong. And I said "oh yes, everything is fine, we just wanted to check out your patio". The manager then walks back in and immediately returns with one of the male bartenders in tow. The bartender comes out and very confrontationally says "Is there a problem out here?". Both my date and I were quite taken with the way the bartender addressed us, and futhermore the fact that the manager felt it was necessary to bring one of the male bartenders out to address us after I had already told her we just wanted to see the patio. My date suggested that we go back inside and check things out some other time, while the manager and the bartender looked at us like we were trying to ditch on our bill or something. Upon walking back inside, the manager asked me if we were thinking of booking a private party on the patio. (Well sheesh lady if I was I certainly I certainly am not anymore!) I once again informed the manager that we just wanted to see the patio.   We got back inside, and my glass of LaFitte was waiting. His sangria was no where to be found. I took one sip, it was bitter, or maybe just my taste buds were. I paid for my drink and we left. The ONLY reason I even think of giving this place anything above one star is because the fried pickles were good the first time around. I have no idea why we were treated so aggressively when trying to see the patio. So go ahead and order yourself some fried pickles. Just dont try and take your date out on the patio.   You have been warned.

Talk about a diamond in the rough! This place is precariously situated just off of scottsdale road on 4th ave...across from Gilligans. Had I not really looked I may have missed it and I would have been sad because this place is great! My sister and our mutual friend went here last night for dinner and had a really good meal.   The food: I love that they have the ability to vary the spicy-ness of the dishes, and then they also bring out several condiments that can make it even MORE spicy if you like it that way. I tasted my sister's curry, which she ordered spicy. I typically hate spicy food but I thought I should at least give it a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised actually! It had so much flavor and just enough bite for me. I ordered the pad thai with tofu, mild, and it was perfect. I still have some left over :). I also ordered some jasmine tea that was delish and my sister and our friend said the plum sake was a great addition to the meal.   Ambiance: the restaurant itself is small, but they make good use of the space. The bar is situated in the back, and I enjoy the fact that their bar is understated so as to really focus the attention on the food. The restaurant has some cool decorations that give it flair, without going over the top with asian accessories. Tasteful.   Service: there was only one server on the floor, and behind the bar, but given that its a small space he handled it just fine. Quiet, but attentive.   For all three of us to eat and drink our total came to around $50, so it was definitely worth the money spent! We will absolutely be back!

Cartel's coffee is quickly popping up all over the valley and I love it! The ambiance at this downtown location is somewhat industrial/structural, with lots of concrete surfaces, wood structure and few soft points. The staff is extremely knowledgeable, at times coming off snobbish about their coffee. I love this trait because while I love coffee, I don't know a ton about how it's made or what method of brewing renders the best flavor out of a given bean. And here at Cartel, that's ok! I simply ask, and the staff tells me which method is good for the bean I've chosen, and thus they render a fantastic cup of coffee each and every time. I'm never disappointed in the product at Cartel.

Okay so throughout my life, my mother has made it quite clear to my sisters and I that making time for spa treatments is ESSENTIAL. That being said, a few times a year, my sisters and my mother and I head to the spa. One aspect of spa-ing that I never really enjoy, is the fact that I have to deal with overly chipper receptionists/spa employees that want to "make my experience just perfect".   After many spa experiences, I realized that I have never actually gone in and had a massage. Facials, wraps, etc. yes, but never a massage. How is it that I skipped the classic? Well, as luck would have it, I met John. I was quickly informed by multiple sources that this man is a massage guru. A friend even went as far to say that if I ever want to get a massage, it should most definately be from him. Alas, I had to give it a whirl.   In December 2009, I made my first visit. When I came to s p a c e I was immediately pleased by many things. First and foremost: no overly chipper receptionist! John invited me in and engaged in massage talk with me, taking a small and necessary history. After that he led me over to the studio. It's beautiful. Its absolutely beautiful. The lighting, the colors, the scent...the whole situation just works. John inquired about any personal tweaks needed, and then left to allow me to get comfortable.   Get comfortable I did! I tend to be cold and mildly anxious most of the time, but this was not the case at s p a c e. The massage table is heated. Yes. Heated. And quite cushy :). John came back to the room, and this is the part that I liked best: no more talking. Just the music, the scent, and me feeling quite fantastic. I think I fell asleep, just for a second, which is rare because I typically dont relax that easily. I could tell John knew what he was doing, because he didnt need to ask me questions. It's like he read the way my body reacted to specific movements and acted accordingly.   When it was time to come back to reality, John let me know very gently. So much so, actually, that even while I was dressing and preparing to leave, I could still feel...s p a c e. You will know what I mean when you go try it.

I have been to Mabels several times since the opening, and I have had nothing short of a stellar experience with this place.   The Drinks: I am an avid champagne drinker, and it is SO refreshing to see something other than Moet Chandon served by the glass! Aside from a good champagne list, they serve specialty cocktails that are off the beaten path and artfully crafted by bartenders that know what they are doing.   The Food: Aaron May. Need I say more? You must, I repeat must, have an order of the deviled eggs with caviar. The tuna carpaccio has become a dish that I regularly fantasize about, as well as the filet bites. The best part about the food, is that it's never too much. It's just the right amount, so you feel like you can enjoy your drink and not be too full.   The Atmosphere: No lies, whenever I am at Mabels I feel glamourous. The mid-century decor, low lighting and music definately set a mood that is anything but Scottsdale Nightlife. The imprinted-tin ceiling, in combination with dark woods and plush seating is somehow inviting and upscale at the same time. Check out the ladies room for sure...the floor is all pennies. How cool is that?  Overall, if you couldn't tell by now, im smitten with this place. Once you go, you too will develop a crush.

I frequent Mabel's quite a bit, and was very excited to hear about their new promotion on Wednesdays, 1/2 off bottles of wine affectionately named wine down Wednesday. We also found that they changed up their dessert menu. That being stated, myself and a few girls came by last Wednesday and split a few bottles of Cycles, ate dinner, and tried their chocolate fondue dessert. The evening was perfection in service, quality and company.

Oh yes yelpers, it's time for a Mabel's update from yours truly. The menu has been re-vamped with some new items! I had the cheese plate and the olives with a good friend this past saturday night and it was delish! There was a white cheddar, creamy may tag blue and gruyere, accompanied by proscuitto and salami. You definitely want to give that a whirl. I'm heading back on thursday to try out the Mac and Cheese they added to the menu, see you there!

I had heard that Mijana serves labneh, and so I decided to wander in...especially since I haven't been able to find labneh since I moved to the valley almost 4 years ago! They used to carry it at Trader Joe's but for some reason they stopped. Anyhow, I was unable to actually have a sit down experience but I stopped in and picked up a carry out.   The restaurant itself is well equipped for entertainment, and it sounds like they have nightly events. My server was very friendly, and I was able to get my carry out quickly. I waited at the bar for a moment while they were putting the carry out together, and witnessed a discussion between the young bartender and two customers. The customers wanted a Crown Manhattan, and suffice it to say, the bartender did not display great knowledge of bartending.   I definately hope to go back to Mijana and have  a full experience, their menu appears to be quite authentic and im always a fan of live entertainment.

Uhm. Shotgun Betty's. Okay...Ive come to Shotgun Bettys a few times...never really out of volition but more like "Hey we have to go get so-and-so from Shotguns". Low and behold, "so-and-so" is always male. Its definately a guy's place, but not because there are dancers on poles. No, no. Ive been to many strip clubs and felt welcome there as a woman because the servers are nice regardless if you are male or female, and they know that money is money whether it comes from a male or a female customer. These girls do not like female customers. Salty looks, snide comments, and waiting insanely long for what would be a simple vodka soda. However, if you are with a guy, your wait time is expedited exponentially. So yeah, I guess the only time I will be going back there is with a guy because otherwise its just not a good customer experience.   Oh...and the $20 minimum thing was just weird. Who does that?

I will say, now that I have been back to Shotgun Betty's a few times and gotten to know the crowd/staff I am a fan. I still don't swing by Betty's much at night, but it has become a favorite for a bloody mary or a margarita during the day. Also, I enjoy the music selection during the day versus night.

Yikes. Came back to RnR this past weekend to give it another go, and it was close to disastrous. The hard part was that it wasnt the server, it was the food/drinks.   Drinks: I had to send my glass of prosecco back twice because it was flat. Now, I know prosecco does not have as many bubbles as champagne, but this was completely flat. Finally, I get a third glass that wasnt flat...but upon taking my first sip...it tasted like chardonnay with bubbles. SIck. Prosecco is supposed to be light, and dry with a little hint of fruit to it. What was that?   Food: We ordered a baked brie, spinach artichoke dip, and the truffle fries. The baked brie came out as being baked, and then falling cold. The spinach artichoke dip was more like soup, and the fries were lukewarm and soft. The server offered to have the baked brie put "back through the salamander", wherein I declined the offer. Really? Baked brie in a salamander? *Cringe*.   Overall the food and drinks were near terrible. Again, the server was really nice, and it definately wasnt her fault. The manager came by, noticing we didnt eat much of the food, and after telling him how things turned out he comped our entire bill. While that was nice of him, hopefully he came to the realization that he needs to hand the chef a red bull or something.

I came to Chez vous a few weeks ago for a late breakfast, and was pleasantly surprised! I lived in Lyon a little while ago and I really really really miss good crepes. I had the Crepe Campagne, which has fingerling potatoes, swiss and prosciutto in it. It was absolutely delicious! True to form, I also got a nutella and banana dessert crepe, as well as a coffee. It did not disappoint! The coffee was a tad weak, but other than that the meal was fantastic.  The decor is very cute but modern at the same time. I love the plates on the wall, and the wonderful color scheme. The service was prompt but not pushy and i got to practice my french a bit. I cant wait to come back!

Oh me oh my. Aaron May I am seriously crushing on your food. Now, I am not educated in the ways of tapas, but for that very reason I brought my friends Matt and Mitch with me as they know far more than I. Anyhow...here goes:  Drinks: Iruna has an impressive wine list, with a wide variety for most any palette that walks through the door. If you can't find a glass you enjoy on this menu, then you need to re-evaluate yourself as a wine drinker. True to form, I went with the Castellar Cava, and it was perfect. I did notice that the drink menu offers several creative cocktails for those nights when you really want your happy hour to get happy :)  Food: Mitch did a lot of the ordering, but what he did order was amazing! Aaron's take on the tomato mozz salad was done with a spanish cheese of some kind that you are going to have to go try for yourself because I can't describe its flavor exactly. Its so good! It was creamier than mozz, but had an extra flavor to it that I just cant describe. Aside from that I tried the goat cheese croquettas, the lamb and the brussel sprouts. Basically I was really hungry. Ok, the goat cheese croquettas...I was a little over powered by salt for some reason with this dish. Not really sure why. The lamb? Yes. Do it. Multiple times. I finished off this evening with the chocolate torta...which was practically orgasmic. Just enough, not too much, and very very sumptuous.   The atmosphere: I want to dance a little when I hear the music in this place! The combination of music, lighting and color scheme will definately put you in a good mood. Its very open, and there is a high top that seats larger parties in the middle. Something about that table makes you want to invite your friends and your family to join you...while being very chic at the same time.   For a first time tapas experience, I had a blast. Many more visits to come :)

I came to Valley ENT about a year ago after having recurrent strep throat infections over several months. I had the pleasure of working with Dr. Gavin Gonzalez, and could NOT have had a better experience. I have referred 4 people to him since then and all of them report having an amazing experience as well. Dr. Gonzalez has a very gentle manner about him, and describes procedures to his patients in a language that is non-threatning and easy to understand. My experience with Valley ENT and Dr. Gonzalez has been a great one, and i will continue to refer him for years to come!

Ok let's be honest I'm a white girl from Detroit, which means I don't know a ton about Mexican food. What I do know for certain however, is that the food I was eating at Vitamin T was very, very tasty. I've had the chicken tacos...which are nearly nirvana with a little sour cream on there. I've also tried the veggie torta. Word to the wise: tortas aren't the neatest of all dishes so maybe get a lot of napkins. The veggie torta was so good, I felt like I couldn't eat it fast enough. Picture petite me, sitting on the delightful patio in my jeans and a shirt amongst a bunch of business suits, literally wolfing down this torta that is messy to eat to begin with. I think I polished that off in about 3 minutes flat. I only stopped once during my meal to realize that I wanted rice with it so that I could unlock the wonderful protein benefit of the black beans. After I ordered, the place filled up quick and I was glad I got there around 11:45 instead of noon.   Another great thing about Vitamin T? You get to play chef for a minute. Oh yes. Vitamin T offers you a salsa/condiments bar so that you can alter the flavor of your dish however you like...hence there should be no complaints of bland food. The salsa bar is a great idea amongst a city of micro-managed office types. This way, Vitamin T gives their customers the ability to take back a little control from their micro managed lives on their lunch break. Don't get too crazy over there at the salsa bar though, lets keep it clean people. I also see postings for some very happy, happy hour specials. That's a win.

So last night, a friend of mine and I were out and about, and he mentioned this new Cigar club that just opened up. A new place you say? Why of COURSE i'm game to try it! Anyhow, he mentioned that it where the estate house used to be, on the third floor. We arrive, and immediately I am impressed with the ambiance of the place. Low lighting, rich woods and luxe upholstery gives it a modern yet classic east coast club feel. I was able to walk around the whole place, which is quite large actually, and was happy to find lots of patio space overlooking the water. They also play old movies on the patio, with the projection on the wall adjacent. Very cool :).   The cigar list is extensive and can be overwhelming to a novice. Not to fear, the staff is there to help you, and they all appeared to be well educated on cigars, cuts, wrappers, the whole shebang. They also have private lockers where you can store your cigars at the right temperature and humidity. Access to these personal lockers is only permitted to members.  Moving on to the members portion...they have a variety of memberships you can purchase for access to the club. At the moment, guests are permitted with an entrance fee, but they will be moving to exclusivity in the near future. The memberships range from individual to corporate, and start at $100 per month. The membership aspect of the club is something I personally feel can be both good and bad. I understand wanting to cater to a specific population, and create that idea of exclusivity. However, once you implement and enforce the members only aspect, people that arent members wind up being mad about it, and then you have a split audience. I hope that everything goes well for the Napoleon, and I can't wait to come watch movies!

A few friends and I came to Citizen Public House last friday evening for a late dinner around 9:15pm. Even at this hour, CPH was still pretty well filled up. The decor is nice, but you can definitely tell it used to be an art gallery with the way the walls are set. CPH made good use of the space however, and lighting as well, with lots of clean lines and dark woods.   Our server, was absolutely fantastic. He came with good suggestions for wine pairings, knowledge about the menu, and timed our food to an absolute T. I ordered the chopped salad, which was to die for. I've never had smoked salmon in my chopped salad before, but the array of flavors and colors was just beautiful in this dish. Looking at the menu there literally isnt a dish on the menu I wouldnt try. I cant wait to go back and dig in again.   The sole snafu of the night was with our bill, they accidentally charged my friend 3x for the total bill, which was expensive for 6 of us. Rich (one of the managers) was quick to try and fix it, but come tuesday morning it still wasnt fixed from friday. My friend went back in on Wednesday to try and have it fixed, wherein another one of the managers was present and apparently took a lot of attitude with my friend. Despite the snafu with the bill, we will still come back.

Spanish fly opened where the old Drift was, and I gotta say that the minute you walk in you feel like you are on vacation. The palm trees, the colorful mosaic tiles, fruity cocktails and pool area complete with a water fall take you away from  your day to day routine. There are a few tables set up, as well as ample seating in the bar areas, and lets not forget the cabanas!   My friends and I received great customer service from the bartenders, and when we moved over to check out the pool area the servers were just as attentive. The menu provided an array of cocktails that were both tempting and seemingly refreshing, as well as a variety of food items. Im sure this place will be busy for the summer pool party season.

I've never been to a comedy club before, so I have no idea how this kind of thing works on the regular. I can say, I felt pretty confused during most of my experience at Stand up Live. A few friends and I ate dinner downtown, and then walked over to the comedy theatre around 8:45pm. The show wasn't scheduled to start until almost 10pm, and the line outside of the comedy theatre was astronomical. I gotta say, waiting in line that long outside, people definitely got frustrated as to why they couldn't go in and sit down in the theatre, order drinks etc. Again, I am a comedy novice, so maybe this is how all comedy theatres work?   Anyhow, we get inside and sit down, and I order a pomatini and the spinach artichoke dip. Both were phenomenal! The drink was well balanced, and the dip was so good that I wanted to bathe in it. Word of caution: do not expect your service to be lickety split. The theatre seats a lot of people, and you could tell the servers were hustling to get things done. It still took a good 20 minutes to get food/drinks out to the tables. I've read some reviews already that suggest the food/drink is pricey, but truth be told I didn't feel the prices were off-point at all. My pomatini and spinach artichoke dip, with an automatic 15% tip came to about $21 which is right where it should be...about $9 for the drink and about $9 for the dip. The tip was added automatically even though I was just paying for me...but maybe because I was part of a larger party they added it...*shrug* another point of confusion. I felt that my server should have said something before running my card and adding in the 15% without me knowing. I wasn't mad about it, but I could see that being a problem for other folks. Either way, I could tell the server was working pretty hard to keep up with everything so I didn't mind leaving him 15% and actually I gave him a few extra bucks for good measure.   The theatre itself was very comfortable to me, with the decor being seemingly unremarkable. The audience should be focusing on the comic after all.  The booths we were at had tables that were not move-able, so our friend that is pregnant definitely had difficulty getting in and out of the table with her belly. I cannot even imagine someone that's heavier set sitting at one of those booths, so I recommend a table versus a booth if you qualify under that description.   Overall, it seems that there are some aspects of the venue that will get ironed out in time, as they have only been open for about a month. Ill be giving it another whirl here in a bit and see if things have changed at all.

I took a Zumba class here with Ryan and Cathy. SO MUCH FUN! I have a pretty decent dance background, and this class was a challenge, but very fun. I love the flavor of a small dance studio like this providing classes versus the classes you can attend in a big gym. It seems that the other participants in the class have been around the studio for a while, and they seem to really enjoy themselves as well.   The only troubling bit about the studio is the parking situation. Which, I don't attribute to the studio's overall score because it is a shared parking lot. There is apparently a bit of a problem with parking because the studio is next to a gym and a tanning salon. So, all of the parking spots are labeled "30 min parking only". There is a parking lot around the back, however when I parked out back I got a note on my door from an antique shop that said "no gym parking". Alas, it seems that there needs to be communication between business owners in the same complex about parking. I don't understand why I got that note on my car door, because there was PLENTY of open parking in that lot so it's not like my parking there would inhibit someone from going to park and frequent the antique shop.

Why, hello Copper Blues, it's nice to meet you! I joined a good friend of mine for the opening this past week and had pretty decent experience. Let's just dive right in shall we?  The Atmosphere: my friend and I were lucky enough to grab a booth in the bar, since it was literally standing room only. The booths are very comfortable cushion wise, however since the place was very very busy, it made it hard to get out of the booth once you got in the booth. It seems that the tables have been placed too close together to comfortably move about during peak dining hours. I'm only about 115 lbs and I had to excuse myself to the woman at the table next to me every time I wanted to get out from behind the table, not to mention climbing over purses etc due to proximity. The musician that was playing on stage provided a lighthearted atmosphere, with acoustics that didn't blow your eardrums out either. Nicely done. Also, I love the lighting scheme, and the views from the patio.   The Food: For the opening event we were lucky enough to be able to try various samples of food. I loved the green pea guacamole, the filet bites and the mac and cheese of course. Since we only got to try the sample sizes, I found myself definitely wanting more. I cannot wait to go back and try a full plate! I ordered a glass of the house Cabernet and suffice it to say I think I'll get something else next time. The cab lacked the full bodied flavor I was looking for and actually tasted very sweet for some reason. Anyhow, that is shame on me for ordering wine in a beer-oriented place.   The Servers: I found that the servers were all very nice, but hopefully over the coming weeks they work on their flow. Since Copper Blues is connected to Stand Up Live comedy theater, you can bet that every night prior to a show it IS going to be very busy just as it was for the opening. That being said, they did not offer the full menu or specialty cocktails for the opening, which will undoubtedly make the servers job more challenging on a busy night. The servers will need to work on their speed and organization if they are truly going to be able to keep the customers happy with their serving time. For the opening, I found that I had what I call a "ninja" server. I would order a drink, and just as I was getting to the point of "Where in the heck did my server go to get my cocktail", all of a sudden it would magically appear on the table and I would see the server walking away. Very nice server, seemed to be knowledgeable about the products, just a strange flow.

Hello Gilbert, AZ :). Every now and again, I find myself trekking across the city to visit friends in Chandler and Gilbert area. I've been to Bar en Gril a few times, and so over the halloween weekend I took a few friends with me before we headed out on the town. There was definitely a good crowd going, and they had a live band playing cover songs which everyone was getting into and seemed to enjoy. Overall, it has a very casual and friendly atmosphere that's also family friendly.   The menu displays your favorite comfort foods and bar fare, with modern presentation and taste. My service experience has been great each time I have been to Bar en Gril, and the owner makes himself available to customers. On the menu you should get the cheese plate for sure, it's perfect for snacking! I've also had their salads, which were flavorful and filling. I NEED to try their pizza, so I'll be back soon to check that off my list.

Rockbar has become a regular spot on my rotation of favorite places to go. I'm in love with the way they remodeled it since acme...and to be honest the staff has become like family. They've got a great vibe at rockbar, and plenty of live music acts. It's a great place to unwind and get silly.

Fresh and delicious! Calistro opened up right by my house and I am so happy about it! The veggie terrine dish is amazing, and the sweet potato mash is to die for. I've also had the steak, which was phenominal. They have high quality tea, of which I love the cranberry hibiscus flavor. Their drink menu also features hand crafted cocktails and an impressive wine list amongst other non-alcoholic drink options.   The decor is clean and polished, with friendly staff and management. The space itself is very large, and so even if it is a busy night at Calistro, you never feel stuffy. Patio seating is available, and since the patio is enclosed they are able to control for climate. Im so pleased to have Calistro in my neighborhood, I hope they stick around for a while!

Hello delicious :). Searsucker is a unique dining experience, and it's one that I've really enjoyed. The way that the menu is set up is different in that you will see many of the ingredients in a dish listed, but not necessarily how it is prepared. Some people will probably be irked by this, but I enjoyed it for the places it lets my mind wander. Also, the restaurant itself spouts a "social dining environment" as in they'd rather you speak with your guests or staff, than be on your phone. Or watching TV, which there is none of in the restaurant. So, if you have a question about how the dish is prepared, don't be afraid to ask and become engaged by it! 2 of my favorites are the artichoke appetizer and a fancy cocktail called "the bootknocker". You'll need to ask for Roberto for that one. Cheers and enjoy!

I came here to get my hair done before going out for my birthday, and I had a great experience! The salon was fairly busy, and so there was a bit of a wait, but the owner and staff were very nice about it and engaging. They even had mini cupcakes and fruit to snack on while waiting :).   The salon itself offers a modern decor that is clean but has enough personality to offer some style as well. The owner informed me that the salon is still in soft-opening phases, and that the grand opening will be mid-December. They offer blow outs, up-do's, hair treatments, and soon they will add esthetics. When I went, I had an appointment with Marliss, who is amazing and definitely worth requesting ahead of time!  So go check it out and get yourself done up!

I stopped by chop shop one sunny afternoon, and after I finished ordering I inquired to the young girl behind the counter how things are going. She replied "Well, good. In fact, most people who came here on day one still come back almost every day". This, is good!  You know what else is good? Their menu is good. Delicious, and fresh, and healthy. I had the Kale Caeser and it was fantastic. The lemon-dijon dressing is definitely to die for. My only complaint was that there weren't enough tomatoes for me. I cannot wait to dig into the rest of the fare...and alas I have tried two of the fresh juices. The liver cleanse and the power green were to two I tried and they were fabulous. I love fresh juice, and the flavor combinations are powerful. The server almost gave my juice to the wrong person, but thankfully they write your name on the cup to avoid this confusion. Also, having written your name down the staff addresses you personally and it creates a more familiar feeling.  Go try Chop Shop! Your body will thank you.

I've had a good first experience at the stand! Their food is all fresh, made to order. I love that. The menu is simple and to the point, with a few extra ingredients like caramelized onions and grilled jalapeño for flair on your burger. I have yet to try the tacos but I will definitely be back to do so. Staff at the stand is friendly, without being fake. My only miss on this place is that there's no cheddar cheese...only American. Give this place a whirl and definitely get the fresh lemonade!

Kaleidoscope is quickly becoming a regular stop for me, now that I found out about all kinds of food allergies that I have! Everything at Kaleidoscope is super fresh, and gluten free. I love their juice combinations, they totally beat anything I have come up with at home in my own kitchen. As they should, the staff are total pro's and really know their products. It's a fun environment, healthy, and quick! Absolutely worth your time and money.
