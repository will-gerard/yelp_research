I ordered a really awesome Nixon watch on ebay and was really excited to get it. When I opened it and went to put it on, the band fell apart. I fooled with it for a good hour trying to put it back together and finally gave in to finding someone to repair it. I had no idea where to go, so of course found this place on Yelp! The guy is super friendly and has very reasonable prices. He had my watch fixed in about 45 second, sure beats my hour struggle!

How does this place seriously not have any Yelp reviews?! Craziness. Went here for the first time today and saw a PA, Christina Cousins... she is awesome! She takes the time to explain things and answers any questions very thoroughly. She is also not a pill pusher at all, makes sure you are totally comfortable taking medications and you know what they are  before she prescribes them.  So, while I can't speak for any other PA's or MD's here, I can say that she made a dreaded doctors visit very pleasant.

RUDE! Seriously, this place is near my house so I called for an oil change and the guy said he could do it right then, so I drive down there and go inside... The guy behind the counter was nothing but rude. He looked at me like I must be stupid since I'm a girl of course, then spoke to me like a jerk father would scold his 5 year old son. They also do not offer synthetic oil... oh but if you bring in your own they'll use it. Lame! I was so irritated I walked out. I'll drive a little further for some good service, thanks!

This place is awesome. I've brought my car here several times and my friends have done the same. They are always very nice and do a great job, none of us have ever had any problems at all. Definitely recommend them for a great carwash!

Seriously, this company has the worst communication and customer service ever! I don't know if they just hire a bunch of incompetent high school drop outs or if they have zero training available, but they need to fix something! Twice now I have tried to get someone out here just to take a filter off my line from outside my apartment and that seems to be an extremely difficult task. It has taken me over a week to attemp getting cable hooked up and I still don't have it! I've been on the phone with them 6 different times and been into one of their stores even. Each time I talk to someone I am told something different... does anyone here know what the h*ll they're talking about?! I'm about to say forget it and go with a dish! I'm a very patient person and don't write many bad reviews, but Cox has got me very frustrated.

Let me just start by saying that I moved here from CA so I'm used to waiting at least 1-2 hours at the DMV before my number even gets called and then everyone is rude. After that, you wait about 6 weeks for your license to come in the mail. Not pleasant at all.   With that said, this is by far the best experience I have ever had at the DMV. I can't bring myself to give 5 stars just because of what it is lol, but I was literally in and out with my new license in 30 mins. The place is clean with a good layout, the chairs are actually very comfy, and everyone I had to deal with was friendly and professional. Big thumbs up for a dreaded trip to DMV!

I took my cat here to be shaved and was even prepared to give an excellent tip... Until I picked him up. I was told that the service would cost $61 and included bathing, nails, and teeth. When I dropped him off they said it would be about two hours, which I thought was pretty fast. Thirty minutes later I received a phone call informing that he was ready to be picked up. When I got there the cat groomer was gone and the other two employees were extrmely rude having "forgotten" what the groomer told them. My poor cat looked absolutely horrible, his shave job was choppy with chunks of hair still falling out, they didn't bathe or clean him in any way, they didn't even try to so much as brush the cut hair off of him. He had patches all over and his mane was the worst. I asked what happened and they weren't sure, but said they thought the guy who was holding him down had his hand grazed by my cat's tooth so they considered it a bite and it is their policy to stop services once that happens. holding him down, really?! I calmly stated that his shave job appeared to be very choppy, to which I revieved a reply of "it's a cat, shaving cats always looks like that, they aren't dogs". Then they handed me a bill for the full price and said they would have the groomer call me when she was back... I still haven't heard from her. Honestly I try not to be too critical of businesses, but this place is terrible. I wouldn't recommend them for a second and if I could give them zero stars I would!

Let me just start by saying holy crap I'm full! This place is awesome! The pineapple is good, but the mango is even better. Turkey dog, cilantro, chipotle garlic mayo, maui mustard, jalapenos, pepperoncinis... seriously what more could I ask for in a hot dog?! The guy who owns it is great too, there was a little mix up and he was extremely accommodating, made sure we were ok and that he made things right, definitely a 5 star experience.

Oh man, first of all I am soooo happy there is finally a place like this in the east valley. Second, it's amazing! The atmosphere is super cute and welcoming, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the food... Holy crap, yum! So far, the tacos duo and the burrito are both incredible. I'll definitely be back to try more since pretty much everything on the menu sounds delicious. Oh and if you like peanut butter & jelly they have an awesome cupcake!
