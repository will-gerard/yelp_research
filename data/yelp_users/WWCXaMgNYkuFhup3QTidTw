If I could eat one sand which for the rest of my life (can't have captain nemo's in placenta, ca since it went out of business decades ago) it would be this tomato, basil, mozzarella sand which on that perfect bread!  Just the perfect amount of seasoning.....I want one now!!!  Love how one can get a sandwich there and a drunk from lux and enjoy the patio!

Things I liked included the parking outside the door and the small, private pools scattered throughout the complex.  I didn't care for the resort fee as it was higher than anything we've paid at any other resort and the amenities just didn't seem worth it.  The rooms were clean, but dated.  Plenty of towels, which I always like.  Bathroom was small, but vanity was fairly large but outside of bathroom which is either a good or bad thing depending on what's important to you.  Waterpark area was okay.  I liked the lazy river, didn't use the slides, and the wave pool really isn't a wave pool.  Periodically, the water starts with what seems like a side-to-side motion and one rocks a bit but there were never any "waves" to propel one forward and have a real sense of movement.   The real kicker for me was when we checked out a day early on a pre-paid, non-refundable reservation.  Our daughter was sick and we just felt it would be better to go home.  I didn't expect any refund or credit for the unused night,  but what was rather shocking was the fact that the counter person wanted to charge us an early departure fee.  I would understand that fee if I hadn't already paid for the night, but why would I pay for the room and a fee to vacate a room that I've paid for?  Seemed VERY strange, but ultimately I didn't have to pay it.   We ended up paying about $760 for the 2 nights (could have stayed for the 3rd) and just didn't really think it was worth it and will probably stick with some of the other resorts that we've liked better.

Used their on-site optometrist who wrote a prescription for one year (wasn't aware of the one year until today).  I broke my prescription sunglasses and it has been 14 months since my exam and I can't get new sunglasses without paying for an exam because my insurance covers and exam every two years.  Now I know to ask about the optometrist's expiration date prior to scheduling an exam.  I've lived all over the country and never had a lens prescription expire in 12 months!  Also, I paid substantially more for the glasses at lens crafters!  Most of my scripts either didn't expire or expired in two years!  I don't believe AZ requires the script to expire in one year.....just a ploy to get more money.  I'm pretty sure people are wise enough to schedule an exam when necessary.

Usually I really enjoy subway, but my last visit wasn't ideal. My preferred sandwich is a veggie and cheese with extra cheese and add avocado. The young man working there the other evening grabbed the package of avocado and there visibly wasn't enough for 2 scoops, probably not enough for one scoop, so he took the spreader and got what he could from the edges and put it on my sandwhich which resulted in a very thin layer with several inches uncovered. I should have said something but didn't as the charge for avocado on a footlong is $1.50. This sandwhich was just under $9 and had little flavor as I don't add sauces or oil/vinegar since the avocado usually add the creaminess, flavor and moisture to the bread. I think I'm done with this subway.

I actually don't mind this theater since it's close to home, but we went to the Amc at arrowhead earlier this week and I believe it was about $2 less per ticket and was totally renovated with reclining leather seats with foot rests. Pal valley theater is just too expensive for its unrenovated status.   Will stick with harkins at park west or arrowhead Amc.

Like the optometrist!  When I wanted to use my vision insurance, they printed out a benefit statement (when I asked).  It appeared to be legit as it had my plan name on it, but the benefit amounts seemed too low and they informed me that was my plan's benefit.  I went home and checked at my benefit was SIGNIFICANTLY higher!  I then went back ane explained that they has miscalculated my benefit and that's when they admitted that they are actually out-of-network for insurance plans, "but it all equals out because we charge lower prices."  Hmmmm....so I then go to west valley vision which was less for contact lens and they game me my full benefit (wv vision did seemed higher for frames, though). I don't appreciate being lied to!

The grounds are beautiful and the patio areas are just beautiful!  My complaint is with the Wigwam Bar.  The food was probably one of the worst meals we've ever had.  We dined there on Easter and perhaps it wasn't the regular or most talented staff due to the holiday, but service was not good and the food was barely acceptable.  We all enjoyed a finely made cocktail and I believe each drink was $9 which is acceptable and comparable to other places.  Our youngest daughter had a virgin strawberry daiquiri which was $6.75 and seemed a bit over-priced, but still acceptable.  We all enjoyed the chips with salsa and quacamole which was good.  I had the quesadilla which was okay.  Somehow not as flavorful as I had imagined from the description, but decent.  Another person had a shrimp and chorizo plate that they felt was okay.  The problem was with my husband and daughter's burgers.  They ordered them well-done, but they were quite pink throughout.  My husband managed to eat approximately 75% of his although he reported that it really was not enjoyable.  Our daughter took one bite and stated, "It tastes like a dirty diaper."  Yes, we're all wondering HOW she knows what a dirty diaper tastes like.  She didn't eat any more of the burger but did eat her fries.  My water glass remained empty throughout the meal.  When the waitress inquired as to how we enjoyed our meals, I did inform her that our daughter's hamburger was quite uncooked in the middle.  She did offer to have it remade, but at this point we all were finished with our meals.  I asked if she could remove it from the check and she did, including the fries that our daughter DID eat.  I was grateful for that.    I think we would go back for the happy hour which I believe was 5-7 daily and had certain drinks and food items for $5.  I don't think I would pay full-price again for the food.  Honestly, we've had better fast-food or quick-service meals, but, certainly the atmosphere at the beautiful Wigwam Resort can't be beat.

I've seen several productions here and have enjoyed them.  Definately need to sit in the orchestra as the balcony is too high and far back to see well.  Hard to compare to the beautiful, older, historic theaters in NYC, but this will have to do.

I typically take my dog to another groomer but was having trouble with scheduling. Ended up bringing our dog here and she looked great at a much lower cost and with better hours for scheduling.  I was very pleased with everything including price, quality, hours, and customer service.

We had an absolutely lovely weeknight dinner here.  The patio was shaded, the misters gently cooling us, and the gorgeous landscape providing a relaxing atmosphere.  The cappuccino, quattro fromaggi pizza, the Margherita pizza, gnocchi, pear salad, and the banana  nutella crepe were great.  Probably the only thing I might not order again would be the pear salad as it didn't seem to be the greatest value.  The pizzas and crepe were PERFECT!  Soft, yet chewy crust delicately supporting the toppings with just a bit of gorgonzola on the quattro pizza!

Lovely  grounds and pools. No lazy river, but I was aware of that when I booked.   Arrived at 3:30 and room wasn't quite ready. They took our number and said they would call when ready. We walked the property and at about 4:15 we went back to check-in to see our room was ready. It was, but we did not receive a call notifying us. Room was great and very large. We had requested a roll-away when reserving the room and again at check-in. After 9:00 we called to find out the status of the roll-away. About 45 minutes later we received the bed.   We enjoyed drinks at the pool and I believe a pi√±a colada was $12 and margarita was $13. Had pizza poolside for $14 which seemed like a good price for decent pizza. We watched the fireworks from our balcony which was great!!  Check-out was interesting as there was a line and a lady walked over to the concierge area and got them to check her out without waiting in line. After they served her, the employees in the concierge area began assisting with check-out, but started with the back of the line which I found quite odd. It reminded me of being at the grocery store and a new register is opened and they don't help the people at the front of the line. I would give the hotel 4 stars, check-in/out 3 stars.

I don't even eat red meat and I have to give it 5 stars!  Love their grilled cheese with onions, fries, and either a strawberry shake or iced tea.  Low prices, fresh food, and friendly employees.  My favorite fast food place!  Parking lot can be a bit challenging and always crowded.   There is another location at the 101 and Camelback that isn't too far away, but not nearly as crowded.

Good fish tacos, quesadillas, and chips and salsa.  A good, safe bet when you either want a quick, inexpensive meal to-go or sit on their patio and enjoy the food.  I tend to like places with a salsa bar and this doesn't disappoint.  Beats taco bell or Del Taco any day!

Bought tires from th a few months ago and it was time for a tire rotation. Took a bit over an hour, but it was a Saturday and a bit busy. All employees were very friendly and upbeat and seemed familiar with their jobs.  The tire rotation is complementary With tire purchase.

I've been to many chipotles before and I recognize that serving sizes vary, but this was ridiculous!  I had brown rice, they were out of fajita veggies, beans, cheese, corn salsa, medium salsa, and guac.  The problem you might ask?  Each item was scooped up with the ladle and then the ladle was shook until the item was level with the ladle. These are not deep ladles!! So, I spent almost $9 for a drink and a bowl that was LESS than 25% full. There was a lady standing next to the register that seemed to be doing QC and, I can only guess, this must be corporate's idea of a serving. I'm done with chipotle-too many other choices!!

The soho salad is awesome and pizza is great. It's priced a bit higher than most pizza places (minus 1 star), but we continue to go because it is so much better than others. I think I could eat the soho salad every day!

I'm always a little leary of dentists since there are so many stories of dentists recommending procedures that may not be necessary, so when I was told I needed two fillings by a new dentist I didn't get the work done.   THEN my tooth started really hurting. I went to see dr wheeler  who told me I didn't need to get the two fillings and that he suspected it was sensitivity and wrote a script for a sensitivity toothpaste.  His staff cleaned my teeth and everyone was casual and friendly, which makes a stressful experience SO much better. My trust in dentists is restored!!  Thank you, Dr. Wheeler and staff!!

So, it turned out that I needed a root canal and crown. Experienced excruciating pain and the staff and Dr. Iniguez was able to get me in the same day and provide antibiotics and other meds that helped provide relief until I could start the root canal. While the dental work was not a great experience (wouldn't be anywhere), I did really appreciate the quality and considerate care provided. I also appreciate the willingness to take a conservative approach before starting a root canal/crown. I know many people feel that they are oversold services at a dentist's office, but that definitely hasn't been the case here. I highly recommend this office!

Excellent chicken that I like more than some of the other quick service tex-mex places; HOWEVER, the quesadilla comes with no extras. Salsa is 99 cents, quac us 99 cents.  I can understand the quac, although the portion size is a partially filled 2 oz container, but to pay for salsa??  The quac does not compare to chipotle. And I wouldn't pay for it again.  The rice and beans are decent, but I would gladly give them up for some salsa!

I really like this place. I tend to not go too often and jump around a bit, but I think this is my favorite. I really appreciate that English is the primary language in the salon and I'm not left wondering if they are talking about my feet (which I would certainly deserve at times)!  Had a pedicure by Vanessa and it was the best massage!!

Had a shellac manicure and appreciated the cleanliness and quality of work.

Will definately be going back and my nails look soooo much better!

Great food and friendly service.  I ordered the chicken pita w tzatziki and Greek fries and it was SOOO good!!  The Greek fries came in a large bowl and could have fed the family. The herbs on the fries were delicious!  We were there on Mother's Day and the owner, I believe, have the mom's a complimentary piece of baklava which my daughter devoured.

The coffee is fine, but after hours they play the music so obnoxiously loud and wear the skimpiest clothes.  I feel like I'm going to a frat party I steady if picking up a coffee. Oddly, the location around thunderbird and 101 is nothing like this....  I'm wondering id this location just hired too many teens that don't know the difference between friendly and obnoxious. The atmosphere seems decidedly different during the day. I'd be surprised if Burger King can here their drive-through customers.  Maybe 2200 hours is when they all go crazy and lose sight of the concept if "at work!"

Love it!  Have been for breakfast and lunch. Had the potato with turkey and it was excellent. Reminded me of Larry's BBQ is Dothan, Al where I used to get a potato with chicken. Hubby said the pulled pork sand which was the best he has ever had, but didn't care for the coleslaw. I like that you seat yourself and carry your own food to the table as it eliminates the usual $8 tip for the two of us at a typical sit-down restaurant....  Also liked that the kids fit well on their large drinks and the straws were easy to remove from their wrappers--hate straws in plastic wrappers as I tend to crack the straw and then it makes it hard to drink. Line moves fairly fast. Oh--hubby really like the potato salad.

I thought the fish was quite good.  Hubby loved it.  The onion rings were great.  My only complaint is that the two offered sauces were mayonnaise-based as was the coleslaw.  I don't like mayonnaise, so I would have appreciated having the ability to choose another offering, or at least cocktail sauce.  Overall, quite good and I'm sure we will be back.  There were plant of other diners, all of whom looked quite content.  The servers seemed a bit unpolished, but were quite pleasant.  Just found out they do have cocktail sauce!!  Yummy!!

I wasn't too impressed. I love Rita's and was expecting a similar creaminess to the custard, but it seemed more like soft serve ice cream. I also felt a bit awkward in the shop and the server seemed a bit distant or uncomfortable.   I probably won't go back--too many choices elsewhere and better prices.
