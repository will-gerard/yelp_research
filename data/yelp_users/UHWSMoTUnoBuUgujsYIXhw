Ohhh this place is the bomb if you're craving a true artisan sandwich. It's a little pricey for a sandwich, but when the bread is made in house in a wood-fired oven, the mozzarella is made fresh in house, it is all worth it to me. The quality of ingredients is what is so fantastic about this lunch spot. It's not too hard to throw some mozzarella, tomato, and basil on some bread. BUT I bet you couldn't do it anywhere near the delicious-ness that this restaurant serves them up.  TRY: the mozzarella basil sandwich it is phenomenal. Also, the Sopressata w/ aged provolone & wood roasted peppers is mouth watering.  If you are ordering the tuna sandwich, be prepared to have it Mediterranean style (olive oil instead of mayo).

Someone in class suggested this place and it was such a let down. A large group of us went and many people liked their sandwiches but my turkey cranberry w/ stuffing sandwich was awful. The stuffing looked like dog food and it tasted like cardboard and fennel. The cranberry sauce tasted like it came from a can and there was nothing special about the bread. The upside is we got our orders fairly quickly and the atmosphere was alright for a quick lunch spot.

I love this place. It's authentic. Excellent selection of Italian delicacies. It would be 5-star if they had Italian chefs in the kitchen--rather than cheap import chefs like the rest of AZ.

I ate here a few years ago and all I can remember is how much I wanted to go back. The patio was quaint and when I saw bacon on the dessert menu I knew it was going to be good, and it was.. Definitely go here if your thinking about it.

One of my favorite places in the Valley. This place is very trendy, has a marketplace feel, but also authentic. We went on a Sunday morning around 11 and it was craaazy busy as we expected. It took about 30 minutes to go through the line and then find a table for 2. I love that you can buy bottles of alcohol here! I found one of my favorite drinks in the fridge, Framboise sparkling lambic beer. I always get The Commuter w/ Avocado. Their rustic breads are great, the English muffins are buttery and delicious. They sell Tammy Coe baked goods and if you know anything about her, you know that her baking is the bomb. I have never had a more flavorful and moist blueberry muffin in my life. I love the curbside service for to-go orders. The iced honey latte is yummy.

Food - 5; STARS!! Service - 3.5/5; Price - 3.5/5; Atmosphere 2/5. This place serves up the best French pastries in the valley. The macarons are to die for, I always go for the chocolate and carmel flavors. The other desserts are great too. I read an article on this place and the owner was taught by a French pastry chef. She is so meticulous when baking the croissants that she sets the room temperature to suit the fussy dough, and on top of that the butter is imported from a special farm in France. The traditional French breakfast was just alright. The baguette was old and took some serious muscle to chew but I couldn't believe how good the raspberry jam and butter was. So good that I savored every bite of the stale baguette. The turkey club (w/ fresh sliced Thanksgiving style turkey) and Dijon potato salad is my favorite lunch item. The whole place is small, fairly cramped, and loud if busy. We were lucky enough to score a table outside that was nice. I can't wait to go back.

Another Phoenix restaurant getting away w/ poor customer service, sub-par food, high prices and A HORRIBLE HOST.  RESERVATIONS--I made reservations for my boyfriends sisters birthday last night (9/24/13). She had a Groupon and we've both been wanting to try out this restaurant for a while. I called to make reservations, no one answered during open hours. I called again, no answer. I went online and found a number to text your reservations. I got a response back very quickly "got it".  When we arrived, we were seated at the table nearly in the entrance hallway. Probably the worst table. (People from the dance studio were sweeping the dust and dirt from the dance floor out their back door right next to our table--gross!) No one mentioned the birthday the whole dinner. Clearly a lack of communication w/ the reservation line. The worst part was when I mentioned our disappointment w/ our experience to the host at the front, he was not empathetic in the slightest way. I made a comment about having a Groupon and the host used it against me saying "well that's the type of service you get when you use a Groupon".--Oh REALLY? I couldn't believe he said that. He was dreadful to communicate with.. I mentioned something about the birthday, and he said "we don't do anything special for birthdays". I asked if they knew how to at least say happy birthday, and he snidely said "we'll happy birthday!" - I told him it wasn't my birthday, it was someone else's in our group. Will never go back. A group of people came up and he changed his attention to helping them so I walked away. He then yelled at me to come back that he wasn't done talking I me. I was done talking to him when he changed his focus to the other group--he clearly has no customer service skills.  FOOD--the only thing they have right is taste (on some items). Total lack of attention to textures. Food comes out of the kitchen sloppy. Overcooked carrots, under-cooked cornbread. Cornbread was sitting in a puddle of juice from the carrots when I got my plate making it extra soggy. Empanadas were fantastic. Pulled pork was good, nothing special. Steak had lots of tendons/cartilage. Topping on the steak was great. Great classic margarita.  I will NOT be going back. NOT worth the money.

I don't normally review grocery stores but if your looking for a good flower department go elsewhere (Shea & 92nd St.). The flower lady is a miserable human being to deal wiith. Just miserable. One of those people that can easily ruin your day.

Truly the best Apple service anywhere.. These guys are extremely knowledgeable, professional, and personable. After realizing how much I love Apple products and how much I DETEST going into the Apple store, I searched the web and found this place. It is my go-to spot for any small questions, HD failures, Time Machine help, etc.. Every time I have had them work on my lap top I either got it back the same day or the next day.

I love this place. The service has always been great, the atmosphere is nice and the food is mouthwatering!! I always get the Ahi Slider, its to die for. I had one of their specials, the Rabbit slider. It was fantastic. However, I only give this place 4 stars because of the inconsistency on their Caprese Salad. It's sad to see such a yummy salad come to your table to find out that you were given only the two small end pieces of mozzarella. Every time I have ordered this salad it is inconsistent. BUT its so good I order it anyway in hopes that its my lucky day). PLEASE GET THAT RIGHT STAX!.. Suck it up and put some more mozzarella on those plates. Oh yeah, and get the tots with the dip. They're the tits... They're happy hour is great too. Oh and the white sangria. :)

If you want a great steak without having to worry if your steak is going to be cooked correctly, go here. My boyfriend took me here for graduation dinner and it was very nice. Our server was great. He was knowledgeable about the wine menu and recommended an awesome bottle to go with our seafood tower. The tower was good, I love that you can order exactly how much of what you want (1 prawn, 4 king crab legs, whatever you choose). The steak was absolutely perfect. Definitely order the butter cake. It might just be the best cake I've ever had, and the strawberries that came with it surprisingly had that garden fresh taste that is hard to find anymore.

A little confused. Was here on Saturday Aug. 24th and food was 5 stars, Jonathan our server was fantastic and knowledgeable. As expected! Read more for our Tueaday night trip.  We came back again on a Tuesday Aug. 27th and THE KITCHEN WAS WAY OFF! We came here after restaurant hopping and decide to share a steak, Mac n' Cheese, and Buttercake b/w 3 of us. The steak was ordered medium rare and came out mooing, half alive. The Buttercake that I rave of was overcooked and overly dense. The mac n cheese was Ah-Ma-Zing!! Bad chef night. Not what I would have expected from Mastro's.   On the upside, I lost my wallet in the bathroom and they were SO helpful in recovering it! Hours later! :)

It has taken me about 3 years of going to Scratch on the reg to come to my conclusion on it. Over the years this place has gone back and forth in my book from 5 stars to a measly 1 star, now it's there to stay with 2.5 stars. LUNCH: It has just come to my attention that they have taken the best thing off the lunch menu--the duck and walnut sandwich w/ olive oil. This leaves me little reason to go there for lunch anymore.. I can buy a better $8.00 sandwich elsewhere, and I can make a better salad than that pile of garbage they call a side salad with nasty dried out carrots and a waste of a perfectly delicious dressing. BREAKFAST: I liked it, but many others I've been with haven't. It's a little dainty, and the bacon is not the regular bacon your expecting.  DINNER: I have not been here for dinner but my parents have and they said it was awful, the French onion soup was horrible and they were out more than one of their main dishes. DESSERT: It is ALL amazing. And I mean really amazing. All of their desserts taste as good as they look. I love the triple chocolate mousse cup, the dark chocolate tart, the lemon meringue, lemon tart w/ raspberries, croissants, and sugar cookies. Overall their service is weak. The desserts are to die for. The food is good but overpriced, and it all comes with sad excuse for a salad. Every time I go back the menu is different to my disappointment. I will definitely go back for desserts, but that's probably all.

I ate here a while ago and I can't remember everything we ordered but overall I thought it was pretty damn good. The atmosphere reminded me of Delux Burger, a little too loud for me but not too bad. The tomato gazpacho I had was fantastic. Someone else ordered the simple salad and I remember thinking it didn't look so simple, it looked great. My friend ordered the squid ink pasta which he really enjoyed (it was more sea-like than I expected but I liked it too, just maybe not a whole bowl of it). For dessert we had cotton candy, donuts, and a chocolate soufflé. They were all awesome. I will definitely be going back.

Ohhh myyyy goodness... These dogs are fabulous! We went here for an early Mother's Day dinner as my mom has been dying to try these after reading about them in the paper.  PROS: What sticks in my mind is the most amazingling soft cloud-like buns. Also, I was surprised at how much I loved the beans they put on top! Yum! Also, the owners were SO incredibly nice. They made eating on the side of Indian School Rd. in a furniture store parking lot surprisingly cozy. It is clearly family run and it shows in the best of ways. CONS: I wish the bacon would have been a little crisper or showcased more, rather than being buried under the toppings. Oh well can't have it all. I will go back!!!

Hands down the best luxury transportation company in Scottsdale!! We have used Top Notch Transportation for 3 years now.  Their drivers are professional, their cars are clean, and they  ALWAYS arrive on time. I use this company because of their dedication to providing the best, most top notch service in town. And they have done just that. Thank you for getting us around the valley safely the past few years!!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon. I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought I'd try a new place and I am SO glad I did. The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals. Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home. You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors). She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way). She's to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help. They keep track of the previous cut that was given (it's annoying some places you to have to tell them every time). I would highly recommend this pet salon. They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding. I can't want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more! Can't go wrong at this salon..

I was very impressed with this sugar hole. More of a boutique frozen yogurt shop. Less of a selection, however, each yogurt I sampled had its flavor PERFECTED. The selection of toppings were excellent, they offered many things I hadn't seen elsewhere. I topped my pomegranate sorbet with chocolate dipped sunflower seeds coated in a candy-coated shell, strawberries, blackberries, and a dark chocolate coated candy. It was FABULOUS.. A perfect treat after my dentist appointment next door, I'll be going back for sure. Service was also excellent, and 5stars for cleanliness as well. Nice job Mix N' Lix!

Great spot for the atmosphere, and absolutely fantastic coffee. Food is good for the majority but some misses.   We go here every Thursday for work meetings. They have great coffee and pastries. I've tried both the breakfast burrito an the breakfast panini.  B. Burrito- YUM B. Panini -- meh not so much.

This place is AH-MAZING!!! Can't wait to go back.  We went here for our 3rd anniversary dinner and I'm very glad we did.   SERVICE-Our waitress was VERY knowledgeable about the menu. She was great at first but when it got busy she completely forgot about us. By the end she seemed more interested in doing roll-ups to get out early rather than paying attention to her tables.  FOOD-  Appetizer: we had the grilled artichoke. The flavor was spot on--BUT it was WAY over cooked.  Entrees: We ordered the Gnocchi w/ Braised Beef in a light Horseradish Cream Sauce, it was FANTASTIC!! I could have licked the bowl it was so damn good--but I was in public. We also ordered the pizza w/ egg, potato, and bacon on it. It was like breakfast on a pizza and man that was a great breakfast pizza. We will definitely be going back just for the pizza. Dessert- Lemon Donuts. OMG so good.  GO HERE IF YOUR EVEN DEBATING IT! I'll be back for sure.

Love this place. It's solid Americanized Italian food. Seating is always fast and friendly, service was just okay. The ambiance is funky and modern yet comfy. The outside patio area is my favorite place to sit, great people watching! The portions are giant. It's a great place to go before/after a Suns game or any other event night downtown.  FOOD: The chicken sandwich has good flavor, but is a little sloppy. The French Dip was great, I would order it again. The Parmesan Fries are yummy. The donuts were PERFECT for dessert!

I loved this place. After a long day of touring homes my client took me to Zulu Caffe for lunch. It was fairly empty inside but had a nice ambiance. We were greeted by a friendly waiter named Roger who seated us on the dog friendly patio. The patio overlooks the airplanes which is might sound wierd but its pretty neat. The food was absolutely fantastic. Normally I have at least one thing that I think could have been done better but our meal was flawless. Great job chef!  FOOD: We ordered the Chicken Wrap w/ a side salad and the Local Pork Shoulder Press sandwich w/ half fries & half sweet potato fries. I highly recommend the pork sandwich, sweet potato fries (yes they were crunchy!!), and side salad (the vinaigrette was plate licking good). Small but nice beer selection, I had the Sunbru from Four Peaks Brewery. The service was 5stars as well. Roger was very friendly, knowledgeable, and a great waiter.  I can't wait to go back for brunch!

Great prices, great food. Zooks is my go-to spot when I'm hungry and in a hurry in Phoenix around lunchtime. The #20 (for turkey lovers) & #35 (for roast beef type people) are my favorites! I always get the kale salad on the side. Service is very friendly!

Had lunch here, but never again. The tri-tip was cooked nice but not very flavorful. The chicken was so-so. The sides need some serious re-thinking. We had the grilled veggies (broccoli), and pork belly mac n cheese for sides. The Mac was super runny, and lacked flavor. The pork belly on top of the Mac reminded me of a meat captain crunch. The owner was very nice, and checked on us. My drink came out with two flies in it and the server said that's what happens when you sit outside... Happily brought me a new drink but I didn't appreciate the snarky comment. I'm excited for a new restaurant to take up that prime real estate in S. Scottsdale!
