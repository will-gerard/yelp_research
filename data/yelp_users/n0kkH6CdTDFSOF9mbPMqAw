If you have ever baked anything in your life you need to check this place out! There is an aisle dedicated to cupcake wrappers alone! Every decoration you could imagine, pans in every shape and size. But the best part about ABC cakes is the incredibly helpful staff. They are experts and will walk you through any pastry related question you may have. The prices are great as well, an added bonus. Awesome place.

I was so happy to see that 10 other Yelpers agree, this place ROCKS!  I know nothing about cars and I will literally buy any part they say I need. Yet I have never felt taken advantage of here. They are not pushy and show you your air filter, oil level and explain in detail everything they did to your vehicle. As an added bonus, the waiting room is impeccable. Always clean and well stocked with water, soda, coffee and even snacks! I have been bringing my car here for over 5 years and I will be a loyal customer forever!

I am gluten free, so I find no greater joy in life than picking up a menu and seeing the "gf" symbol next to items I can indulge in.  I ordered the spinach and turkey lasagna and it was a dream come true.  Our super friendly waitress explained that they use a spinach noodle that is completely gluten free!  It came in a rustic dish that I wanted to take home with me and was cheesy, robust and delicious.  My friend ordered a gluten free pizza which was also a hit.     I can't wait to go back!

The best word I can think of to describe this place is 'meh'. I went here for lunch and I was underwhelmed by the menu. I ended up getting chicken salad with fruit. It was a small scoop of mediocre chicken salad on top of a bed of undressed greens with some grapes and two strawberry slices sprinkled on. When I asked for some dressing they told me there was some on the table. They must have been talking about the oil covered squeeze bottle containing a tasteless vinegarette. Not impressed.

Gluten friendly! They make their own gluten free buns as well as gf fries! The burgers are top notch. Killer flavor combinations. We tried the Parmesan truffle fries which were decadent and a caramel sea salt milkshake which I am still dreaming about. The set up is efficient and the staff friendly and very helpful. Do yourself a favor and try this fantastic burger bar!

I brought a party of 14 ladies here for my sister's bachelorette party last weekend. I was utterly impressed. The space is modern, rustic, with a hipster vibe. Our server (whose name escapes me, as it was a very eventful weekend) was awesome. She had an answer to all our questions and handled our large party with poise. The food was simply delicious. The entire menu is gluten free and they also have tons of vegetarian and vegan options. The pizzas had a thin crunchy crust and the topping combinations are interesting and totally yum. We also sampled their salads and pastas, nobody was disappointed. They were also able to give us all separate checks, which was incredibly helpful. Overall it was a five star experience and I will come back every time I am in Vegas!

Grabba Green is amazing. I have a gluten allergy and am following a clean eating diet. Grabba Green is literally the only fast restaurant I can eat at. My favorite is the SoCal Grabba Grain but I also love the Indochin and Southwest. If you are expecting it to taste like most nasty fast food establishments, you will be disappointed. I think some other reviewers don't have a refined enough palette to appreciate the health benefits and delicious flavors Grabba Green has to offer. I eat here 3-4 times a week. I would eat here every day if they had a location closer to my house! You need to try it.

I tried Grape Wine Bistro today for happy hour and was very impressed. We were greeted promptly by a friendly waiter and took a seat at the bar. He immediately took our drink order and I was enjoying a glass of wine within 2 minutes! The wine selection was unique and they also offer a full bar.  Since we were meeting a friend for dinner we just ordered the cheese plate as a snack. They had 10+ cheeses to choose from along with 4 Italian meats. The plate came with marcona almonds, grapes, apple slices, crackers, baguette toasts and tasty apricot preserves. We chose a rosemary asiago which was amazing along with manchengo and sopressata which is always a good idea. I will definitely go back for dinner and recommend it to friends! P.S. They have brunch on Saturdays and Sundays with $1 mimosas and bloody Mary's!

Mobile Device Docs are hands down the best iPhone repair service in Phoenix. I have recently come upon a streak of bad phone luck and Isaiah has now saved my life two times! First, I dropped my iPhone 5c and shattered the screen. Isaiah was able to meet me within the hour at the dance studio where I work and replaced my screen in 30 minutes flat. He was very personable and I felt like I could trust him with my precious iPhone. The price was reasonable, actually cheaper than two stores I had called to get quotes from. Just three weeks later, the bad luck continued and my iPod touch fell off the counter rendering the screen dark and useless.  I use it for my job as a dance teacher so I needed it to be fixed ASAP. Isaiah came to my rescue once again and had the digitizer replaced in 35 minutes. I will recommend Mobile Device Docs to every one I know who needs an iPhone repair. They also fix Samsung, HTC, and LG devices! It was the easiest, fastest, most pain free experience of my life. These guys are my heroes!
