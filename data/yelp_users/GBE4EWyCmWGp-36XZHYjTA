Meh, disappointing. The food and service were nothing to write home about. I got the Eggs Benedict. The hollandaise was tasteless and coffee tasted like dirt.  My plate was taken away by Tina without being asked if I was done.  The same server didn't even thank me when she gave me my bill.  I would have had better food and service at Denny's.

They have the MOST amazing pies I've ever had.  Their breakfast was delicious and reasonably priced.  The biscuit and gravy was unbelievable!    But, unfortunately, the service leaves little to be desired.  There were literally five empty tables on a busy Saturday morning and we were told there was a 25 minutes wait?  We were pinched for time so we ended up sitting at the bar.  It took good 10 minutes before we finally got a menu (we had to ask twice for it).  We were never once asked if we were okay and if we needed anything else.  We had to wait five minutes before finally getting our silverware after being served our breakfast.   All the staff were discourteous and impatient.    I think I'll just get pie to go next time I come here.

This place is hip with walls adorned with funky art from local artists.  Their food is out of this world; same goes for their wonderful coffee.  I usually go there in the morning on weekends for breakfast.  My favorite is their Monaco omelet and Mexican Coffee.  I would give this five stars if 1) the owner would take the time to actually crack a smile.  Her chilly demeanor can be intimidating.  And 2) if service was better.  There are times where I would have to wait forever before being acknowledged.

They did an exceptional job.  My car went in completely filthy and came out virtually spotless and shiny.  I was impressed.  So, why only one star?  They stole all of my change that was in the cup holders.  Granted, there was only probably $5 total but still a very shitty thing to do.    Not coming back.  If you decide to go here, hide yo money.

Over 100 different types of beer from all over the world to choose from, including some brewed by Papago (try their Orange Blossom!); great, friendly staff and patrons; excellent food (It's no Roy's, but the food is pretty damn good for a brewery); comfortable ambiance; amazing prices.  What more can you ask for?    If you come to Scottsdale, this place is worth a visit, especially if you're a beer aficionado!

I've been a frequent patron for four years now and can't remember a single time when I've had a bad experience.  Great food, amazing beer and wonderful, friendly staff... It doesn't get better than this!

J'adore ça!  This Paris-inspired coffeehouse-bistro-boulangerie is tres charming!  When I sauntered in, I instantly felt like I was teleported to France.  The woman at the cashier was amiable and exuded a warm vibe.  She even sat herself next to me while we had a light tête-à-tête about Paris.  Now the food.  Oh. My. God.  Mere words would not do justice to elucidate the tantalizing ecstasy that my taste buds experienced.  My taste buds pirouetted as I masticated their gluten-free, wheat crepes with goat cheese and spinach with a side of salad.  When my teeth sank into their raspberry and cheesecake tart, my buds burst into song.   "This tastes EXACTLY like the tart I had in Paris," was my first thought.  Believe me when I say I will be back very soon.

This place is AMAZING!!!!!  My mouth salivates every time I think of their food.    A great place for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  They have a wonderful variety of beer and wine to choose from.  AWESOME atmosphere!  TWO THUMBS UP!!!!

Great food, beer, prices, staff and atmosphere.  I'll be moving to a house just down the street in a few weeks.  I think I've found my new favorite watering hole!

Just like everyone else, I bought a deal with them through LivingSocial.  I've sent numerous emails and left over 10 voice mail messages and never heard back from them.  Disappointing!
