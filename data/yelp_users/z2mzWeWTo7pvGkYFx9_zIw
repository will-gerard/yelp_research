This is a nice casual mexican fast food/dine in restaurant.  When you first walk in theres a counter to place your order, your then given an order number and seat yourself. We came here on a thursday night and to my surprise they were pretty busy, with a live band outside( descent music) the other diners seemed to be having a good time  which is an automatic bonus, people by nature thrive on other people's vibes. One of my favorite things here is they have a self serve chip and  salsa bar that was well maintained visually and for the most part seems cleanly, the salsa is really good and taste very fresh they also have toppings like onions, pico, lemons, cilantro and  cucumbers all fresh! Which I applaud.. we munched on the unlimited chips and salsa for awhile the wait was a little longer then I would have expected,  but I was in no hurry and was just enjoying the company of my family. We eventually got our food I split a combo meal with my partner  that came with a taco, tostada, tamale, and rice and beans. And ordered a kids hamburger with fries for the kids. This place has very large portions so its cost effective for the family 16.98 $ fed my family of four and we were pleasantly stuffed. And im a gal that can put it down im by no means a rabbit. So when I say large portions I do mean it. The only thing I could suggest for the restaurant is the rice is very disappointing to me and bland, im a pretty hard critic when it comes to spanish rice, because I make a killer Spanish rice I grew up on. The other thing I wasnt to pleased with , I did not like the fact that a few of the staff were chasing eachother around the restaurant and one almost ran my 6 year old daughter over.  There is a time and place for rough play and on the clock should not be one of those times. Overall opinion is pretty tasty and affordable. . I will most definitely come back for the food .

This is  a great spot. I was taken here on a date, we had a reservation for 2 on the patio and I was really pleased with the seating I dont usually perfer outdoor seating,  but at this restaurant id say Its one of the best seats and very gorgeous.  We were seated within just a few minutes of arriving.  The atmosphere is really warm and inviting as well as the staff I really appreciate when Im welcomed immediately by the hostesses it has a huge impact on my perception of a restaurant ( customer service is key and they have it)... The food was very good  also they have a good variety of choices we stuck to a simple  but yummy margarita pizza with fresh basil, bruchetta appetizer,  and drinks. Our waitress was attentive,  but not overly smothering which I liked especially while on a date.  I can absolutely see myself coming back here wether its on a date, with friends, or family....

Came into this location on 7/29 at 950 am on my break really in the mood for coffee. I was greeted by a employee that seemed to hate his job or life couldn't tell. I asked what their most popular coffee was and was told all of them, with sarcasm then I agreed to a particular coffee come to find out the machine was broken. No biggie I thought. The guy imeditaly came to the register and handed my money back without offering " is there something else you might like". So then I asked well can I get a iced coffee instead and was told verbatim " it's gross " by the employee! I told the guy I've had plenty of iced coffees here and always enjoyed them. He replied ok il help you he then poured a ton of milk into the cups I'm talking about 90% of the cup with milk and then a dash of coffee. So the drink was not chip ahoy nor sweetend like I had asked  and that took 15 minutes... I was ready to leave and asked how much and was told don't worry about it. So I smiled and said thanks but then tried the drink when I got to work and was disgusted no wonder he didn't charge me. Neither my friend or I drank the coffees if I wanted milk I would go to the store and buy it.. Needless to say I will no longer come here for anything it was a waste of of time and that employee lacked any sort of customer service skills let alone social skills and really seemed to hate his job, I would be mortified to have an employee like that work for me. And for the record I rather drink a gallon of the putrid coffee we have at my work at least it wouldn't come with a shity attitude .

So I previously did a review on the tramonto good egg, and I must say im super bummed I dont feel like I can brag about this location anymore. I loved coming here with my two little ones for the upbeat environment. I dont know if the management has change or what, I do see a few new faces . The food is still good but good with a not so good vibe is just another buisness to me that wants my money and I can put my money where its really wanted and earned. After all this is a customer service industry and a customer should feel that way. Hope things change so il want to come back. :/

I just came here for the first time it was a peaceful yet fun staycation. We stayed on the very top floor aka the love floor our room had windows wrapping the room facing the mountains and golf course(sorry to the golfers that saw my indecency). It was gorgeous I didnt even want to leave the room or the view. The room came stocked with everything we needed including a mini fridge wich was perfect for the yummy jello and gummy bear shots I brought along for our weekend. Even though this is part of the casino it is very well laid out you feel like your in a different world. When I come back I will absolutely do the love floor again I think id be let down if I did anything less.. I love this place!

First thought that comes up when I think of my recent visit to orange sky "perfect". I was taken here on a date and I was already having a great night. When we arrived we were 25 minutes early for our reservation and the staff was more then welcoming they got us in right away. The atmosphere is upscale but warm not to stiff, I enjoyed the food as well. I had a shredded asparagus salad and my date had a new york strip and all was amazing.. the view from the restaurant is beautiful . If I could make any suggestions it would only be to add more variety to the salads on the menu I only seen two salad options. Im not a meat or seafood hater but I do enjoy a fresh salad. I will definitely come back and recommend to others

So I recently had bought a groupon deal for 1 full syringe of juviderm at lunchtime lift md , I was so excited to book my appointment  I've had my lips done before at another spa ( Beverly Hills rejuvenation center) in Scottsdale which was amazing btw!! But I came across this awesome deal on groupon full syringe juviderm for 40% off so I bought it spent 232.00$ including a groupon discount I had, so went ahead and scheduled an appointment for 06/13/2014 @ 12pm but the day prior I received a call that I'd have to reschedule  do to the  person that was going to do my injections was sick. I was bummed but I know that life happens so rescheduled for the following Friday (today) 06/20/2014 same time but an hour prior to my appointment  I got a call once again I'd have to reschedule do to  an emergency  !!!! Ugh, the receptionist was nice about it tho.. I was really looking forward to using this groupon and bragging about this company but I can't they are not flexible and probably need a larger staff if there's always emergencies. So I did not reschedule instead I called groupon and kindly asked for a refund which they were awesome about they even offered to contact the company and schedule for me but, it's the principle I'm to busy to keep getting cancelled on I work full time and have 2 kids. And how much of an emergency could it have been , once I called groupon to ask for a refund I got a call back from lunchtime lift md telling me oh you can still come in today... No thank you!!! I will find a company that wants my business.... -Leah
