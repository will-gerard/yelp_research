This is a fairly large zoo.  You definitely need an entire day to see everything.  There are lots of interesting animals, the prairie dogs being my favorite.  I was disappointed though that there weren't any aquatic animals like seals, polar bears and shark.  Parking was no problem, lots of space.  There aren't many indoor exhibits so beware the sun! I ended up getting heat exhaustion by the end of the day and vomited.  Drink lots of water and wear a hat!  I would also recommended bringing snacks and even your own lunch.  Tuesdays are only $10 instead of $20.

If you want good quality food, this is the place for you.  However, be prepared to spend a pretty penny.  Just to be apart of their "locker club", which just stores your favorite wines (that you have to pay for in addition to the locker fee), it costs $300. This is meant for snooty types that like to impress people.   Anyway, I've been able to sample some of their food, no expense to me THANK GOODNESS, and everything was delicious.  It is like they have someone singing sweet lullabies and nurturing each plate of food in the back.  If you get a chance, book their cozy back room for a private party. I believe the booking is free. Can you believe that?? Or maybe I'm wrong.

Most confusing airport ever! I've been to quite a few airports and I've never seen an airport so difficult to navigate, that includes walking around inside and driving on the roads outside.  Just very poor signage.  Airport is nicely updated though...

Lots of unique items here. I was happy to see that not every booth was selling the same stuff, unlike other markets I've been to.  You can find nice handmade decor for your home.  They have live music, cheap breakfast and tons of parking.  This is an open air market so avoid coming here in the summer, unless you want to sweat like a pig.  I made that mistake.  I thought if I got there early enough, it wouldn't be so bad, but I was wrong.  They have fans and misters going but I think the misters make it way too humid.

I decided to switch to Sunwest Dental this year after having a horrible experience at another dentist.  The past dentist I went to had a very upscale office and brand new, advanced equipment.  However, I learned after I had spent too much money and was in too much pain, that they had just swindled me.    Sunwest Dental does not have the latest equipment (actually looks like its from the 90s) or the most updated office, but they use what works and don't spend their money trying to impress and scam clients. I trust the dentists here and I feel like they actually care about me.  Pricing is fair too.

I wanted to try something pizza other than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  I figured California Pizza Kitchen would have better quality pizza.  I ordered the 5 cheese and tomato pizza with regular crust.  The crust was so thin and tough to chew.  I'm scared to see what an actual thin crust pizza would be like.  Besides the tough crust, the pizza tasted fine. The size of the pizza is pretty small too for the price you pay.  My husband and I spent $27 just for pizza!  I think I'll go back to Papa Johns...

There are a lot of good stores and deals here but I don't like to come here during peak hours.  This seems to be where all the teens and sketchy people hang out. It also gets very crowded as well.  Come in the mornings during the week if you can.  Pro: Good stores and deals Con: Sketchy shoppers

I liked this theater because it is not too huge or too small.  It's easy to navigate and is not overwhelming.  I didn't feel like a criminal going through security. It was fast and they were friendly.

The only time I venture out onto Mill Ave is to come here for trivia on weds.  I try to avoid Mill Ave because parking is stressful.  There are very few spots to park for free.  You most likely will have to pay to park, even after 6pm. So far, I've had the potato leek soup, chicken pot pie and the fish and chips, all of which were amazing!! The fish and chips are probably the best I've had, and I've lived in Florida for 4 years where fish is their thang. The only thing I don't particularly like about Rula Bula, is that if you come in a large group, they won't split the bill.  I always feel like I over pay when I am forced to pay this way.

I never had fish tacos before and the idea of it sounded strange to me so I was a little weary to try them.  I tried the mango jalepeno mahi mahi taco and the original fish taco.  Both were delicious! I liked the mango taco a little more though.  It tasted light and healthy.  Prices are fair.  Rubio's is a mix of fast food and sit down.  You order at the counter and then a worker brings the food to your table, kind of like Chick-fil-A.  I like this because there's no tipping required!  The decor is fun; it's a mexican beachy feel.

I wasn't expecting the hotel rooms to be all that nice since it is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip and it is older.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find an updated, clean room.  It came with a fridge, keurig machine, wifi and lcd tv.  The hotel is centrally located on the strip so its easy to get anywhere.  From walking around the other casinos, Casino Royal at the hotel seemed to have the cheapest tables, $3 min for craps and $5 min for blackjack.  Michelob beers are $1 and there are $1.99 footlong hot dogs at the food court!  Parking is free as well.

I felt like I was actually in Mexico when I ate here.  The restaurant is not located in the best part of town which may deter some people but once you're inside, you forget about the exterior.  When you walk in, there is a bar stocked full of different tequila, and luchador paintings hang on the wall.  Local art is displayed throughout the rest of the restaurant and is available for purchase.  The food is not your typical rice and tacos.  It has an interesting twist.  I ordered the "pollo poblano".  It was some of the best chicken I have ever had.  The food is a little pricey (around $20-$25 an entree) but it is definitely worth at least one visit.    Also, do not forget to take a trip to the bathroom! It's pretty interesting...

Such a sad sad buffet.  I shouldn't have gone to Caesar's palace's buffet before coming here. The Monte Carlo buffet is small, has less to choose from, is low quality and over-priced.  I can't believe they charge $30 something. There was one person a head of me in line, unlike the 1 hour line I had to wait in for Caesar's palace's buffet.  I hate waiting in lines, but the length of the line just tells you how good the place is. I came for brunch, so they had both breakfast and lunch food out. I had to make 3 trips around the buffet before I could SETTLE on something to eat.  The orange juice was more like water and the scrambled eggs were super runny.  I've had better eggs at motels. It's not worth coming here, unless you get a free voucher with your hotel stay.

This restaurant is located inside the Eiffel tower on the strip.  The inside of the tower if made to look like you are walking down the street outside with a bunch of little shops.  The restaurant has "outdoor" and indoor seating.  Everyone at my table ordered the Caesar salad.  It was the cheapest entree on the menu.  It was really good though.  We also got free bread (always wins me over).  Many of the servers appeared Parisian, or at least not American.  It was a nice experience.

One word to sum this place up: YUCK! My husband and I recently moved to Chandler and this place was referred to us by a friend.  When I first entered the place, I noticed the lack of ambiance.  The plastic tables and chairs did not help.  If you are new to Chino Bandido, they have you try several samples of their food, which was a nice touch on a so far lack-luster impression.  I decided on the Jade Red Chicken.  I was served my order but I wanted to wait for my husband to be served his before digging in.  We waited about 15 minutes and his order never came out so he went up to the counter to ask about it.  Apparently they forgot to put his order in.  By the time his order came out, mine was cold.  I took a bite from my chicken, and was confused so I inspected the piece further.  It was dark and did not taste like chicken. I tried a few more pieces and discovered the same thing.  I brought my order up to the counter and had the staff verify that it was chicken.  I'm still not convinced it was chicken.  To make the experience worse, I noticed one of the workers taking a few bites from a customer's order before bringing it out to them.  They were still chewing the food when they served the customer. Gross!

This is a very quiet and relaxing garden.  You can pay $1 to feed the Koi fish. I would highly recommend doing this.  It was very entertaining.  You can explore the entire garden in about 30 minutes.  It is not very big.  I was expecting a larger garden, especially for the $5 admission.  However, I guess if it were any cheaper, it would be more crowded and less relaxing.

This place kinda has a hipster vibe.  They play folk music, which I like.  They serve very unique menu items.  I had never heard of a pasty prior to going there.  Its a baked pastry with some sort of combo of ingredients inside. The outer crust reminded me of a chicken pot pie.  The seating is different. The tables are so long and the benches are pew-like, you could potentially share a table with some strangers.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of at this place is that the pasties are pre-made and you cannot customize your order. For instance, I ordered the Vegetarian Greek and I HATE olives but I could not get mine without them.  So I ended up just picking them out as I ate.  I also got the potato-leek soup, which I love and many places don't serve.  It was pretty good.

Moon Nightclub is located at the top of The Palms.  I came here on a Friday night and both guys and girls were free to get in.  In addition, girls got 2 free drinks.  Can't ask for anything more.  The club has great views of the strip.  There are scantily clad women that dance on platforms, pretty good music and a lower lounge that used to be the playboy lounge.  The lower lounge was pretty dead compared to the dance area upstairs.  The club is also located off the strip so if you are staying on the strip, you will have to make a long walk or drive.

Decided to come here because I found out they do trivia on Mondays.  I came in late but I was still able to join for trivia.  This place is a bar/restaurant with an eclectic feel.  There are random objects and frames on the walls.  Menu items were very reasonably priced. The soft pretzels are one of the best I've had.  I ordered the fish and chips and you get a lot of food for your money. The waitress (Bonnie) was very friendly and attentive.  Overall, it was a good time.

I was really excited to experience the pool parties in Las Vegas.  I had seen pictures and it looked like a really good time.  I happen to stumble upon Bare Pool Lounge while walking through El Mirage.  Almost everyone standing in line with me and my husband was on some sort of elite guest list that got you in free and got you free drinks, except for us.  My husband had to pay $20, while I was free because I am a girl.   When I first entered the lounge area, I was disappointed in the size of the pool, it was very small. We found two open lounge chairs and sat down.  A few minutes later, a waitress came over and told us we had to pay at least $50 for drinks to sit there, so we moved to the ground.  Eventually we ventured into the tiny pool.  It was disgusting. There was hair and unidentifiable particles floating around.    There was a second pool that was above ground and you can see through.  It looked cool, but of course you had to pay extra to use it.  The whole lounge just seemed like a place to assert your status.  In summary, we paid $20 to sit on the ground and swim in a disgusting tiny pool.

This is one of the trashiest Plato's Closets I've been to.  I moved to Chandler from Orlando, where there is a Plato's Closet every 5 miles but now there is only 1 within a 20 mile radius from me.  Next closest one is in Scottsdale. So I am forced to go here.    It's dark, cramped, messy and dirty.  There are stains all over the carpet.  Many items are worn and holey.  I avoid going down isles with someone else in them because there is no getting around them.  The isles are so narrow.    Lastly, they need to invest in a whiteboard like all of the other Plato's Closets.  Usually the sales associate will write your name on the board when they are done looking through your items but at this location, they expect you to guess when your items are ready.

I was a little skeptical about eating here because of the location.  The area is a little industrial and barren for my taste.  However, I am glad I stopped in. You place your order at the front and sit down and wait for your food to come out.  There are workers that come around and ask if you need anything, much like a restaurant where you have to leave tips for the servers...but here you are not expected to!  I love that.  I hate dining out because it is so expensive to begin with and then you have to leave a tip on top of that.    Anyway,  I had the pecan waffles for breakfast, AMAZING!! It was very sweet though so you must have a sweet tooth.  The homemade mango smoothie was awesome as well.   A few cons... This place needs more bathrooms.  Only one stall for each gender.  My husband waited our entire stay because one guy was hogging up the bathroom with probably the largest load ever.  My husband could not wait any longer and had to sneak into the woman's bathroom while I stood guard, haha. Also, they use Styrofoam cups.  I shed a tear for the environment that day ;(

This mall is very clean, upscale and modern.  There are several great shops like Top Shop, Forever 21 (2 stories!), Free People and Zara.  Every so often they have fashion shows going on. The runway pops up out of the ground.  It was really cool. The food court has affordable food compared to the rest of the strip. My husband and I ate at Panda Express for a total of $8.

First of all, you get to seat yourself.  That's kind of nice being able to sit where you want to.  But when you think of having to seat yourself, you probably imagine a fast food restaurant.  This place is pretty classy and tastefully decorated.  Meals are cheap.  I ordered the cheese quesadilla appetizer as my main dish for $3.75 and it was humongous.  I was only able to eat half of it.  Happy hour specials are good too.  I got a margarita for $3.50.  Service was great and quick. The only down side to this place are the menu options.  There is not much to choose from.  However, it does seem like you can add and substitute items which creates a little more variety with the menu.  I would definitely come here again in the near future.

Located right inside the Excalibur hotel, this is a convenient place to go if you are staying there. I received a $20 food voucher when I booked my room at Excalibur.  Items on the menu were a little pricey, so I ordered a few side items instead of an entree with my voucher. That being said, best tomato soup and mashed potatoes I've ever had!!!! The staff was friendly but seemed disappointed when I mentioned my voucher. Also, this restaurant is only open for dinner.

This is one of my favorite 2nd hand shops.  They give you money on the spot for your unwanted clothing, shoes, jewelry and purses.  Their purchasing system is smart.  They have about 5 stations so that several people can layout their items at a time. This makes things go a lot quicker. They almost always purchase from me and I get an average of $2 per item. Not too bad.    As far as purchasing from them, I find a lot of cute, affordable jewelry.  They also have a large selection of shoes. When I need shoes, I always look here first before buying a new pair elsewhere.  *Check in on Yelp for $2 off any purchase!!*

I had really high expectations for this park after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp.  I was very disappointed with this park.  There was trash, broken glass and graffiti everywhere.  I was more scared of stepping on a piece of glass than a snake jumping out at me.

I've been to 4 different state/county fairs in my life, all in different states, and this one is by far the worst. Not only is it $10 to get into this sad fair, but you have to pay $20 to park in some sketchy lot. Then you most likely will have to cross the 6-way intersection to get to the entrance, which seems like it takes eternity. The area where you purchase your tickets is very small and cramped.  I came during a busy time ($2 before 2pm day). There seemed to be no real defined lines, just a crowd of people fighting to get to the front. Once I got inside, it was just endless stands of deep fried food and games you can never win at.    There really is not much to do there.  I've been to fairs where there were petting zoos, barns full of animals, largest vegetable contests, antique entrees, and Elvis impersonators as well as other somewhat talented performers.The most exciting aspect of the fair was paying 25 cents to feed some ducks through a wire fence. However, HOWEVER, you are allowed to bring in your own food and drinks but if you don't, be prepared to fork over $9 for a beer, $3 for a bottle of water and $5 for one deep fried Oreo.  Good luck finding a water fountain, and if you do, it's probably out of order.

I was really confused when I first walked in.  There was no menu and I didn't notice the price on the wall for the bowls.  When I got in line, I had no idea how they were going to charge me, by weight? certain ingredients? by gender? I didn't know. No one had explained it to me.  I found out later that you pay one flat price. I made it through the process fine, got my food and enjoyed it immensely, until I noticed that they did not put in one of my ingredients! They took out the pineapple from my bowl of ingredients that I handed them. Why?! What do they have against pineapples?  The waiter was very friendly, until he learned that I had a high value coupon. Then he practically ignored me the rest of the time.  That was fine, because I didn't really see the point of waiters at this restaurant anyway since they don't really need to take your order. Overall, the food was great, you get a lot for the price. Now that I know the process, I would come back again.

My first impression of this place did not start off great.  My husband, myself and a friend from out of town came for a lite dinner and wanted to be seated outside. We waited about 30-40 minutes to be seated.  Once they finally told us our table was ready, they sat us in the cigar room. The cigar room has 4 walls but no ceiling. I guess you can consider that outside, I dunno. However, there are no tables in the cigar room. How were we supposed to eat? We didn't want to wait any longer so we just made due. One look at the menu and I was suddenly full. Wow is this place expensive! $12+ for a cocktail? I ended up ordering the non-alcoholic carrot juice for $4. It was actually really good.  We ordered 2 appetizers to share between the 3 of us. We thought that would be enough, seeing that each appetizer was about $13. The appetizers ended up being more like samples. I was somewhat embarrassed in front of my our guest. We all had to fight over these tiny appetizers.The only upside to the night was the carrot juice and the attentive server who kept refilling our free water.  Overall, I would recommend this place only if you want to spend some major dough and still be hungry when you leave.

If you want a hip, classy place to eat, this is it.  As many may already know, this restaurant was once a department store.  I love the idea of reusing a building instead of tearing it down.  It's especially cool because they kept some of the old aspects of the department store.  The restrooms appear to have been the old fitting rooms.  The menu consists mainly of unique sandwiches.  One of the side options is the slaw, which they put a unique twist on.  It contains feta and raisins.  There is also a DJ that plays great remixes.  Overall, I great place in downtown Phoenix.

I'm always a little leery about going to Sports restaurants.  They usually lack character and the food is never impressive.  I reaffirmed this belief with my visit to Majerle's.  I ordered the soft chicken tacos, which was listed under the "Entrees and Sandwiches" category.  It said all entrees and sandwiches come with fries.  I was greatly looking forward to this, because my tacos were to also include chips and salsa (which I hate).  I never did receive fries with my meal.  I know tacos and fries don't normally go together, but the menu made me believe they did.  I asked the waitress why I didn't receive any fries and she replied, "because I ordered the tacos".  No where on the menu did it say "Tacos do not come with fries, even though it says entrees receive fries". It may seem like I am over-reacting about some fries, but the tacos I received were tiny and unfilling and I did not touch the chips.  Chips and salsa should be free, not part of a meal! The waitress was very unsympathetic about my issue.  When I asked her how much it would be to get a side of fries,  she insisted on showing me the price on the menu instead of just telling me, like I should have searched the menu better. The waitress never came by once to fill my cup of water, but was eager to get everyone else another beer. I sat there with an empty cup the majority of the meal. The servers in general were not very friendly. One last complaint, the chicken in the tacos were supposedly marinated in a sauce but the chicken was rather dry and bland.  I did not taste any seasoning what-so-ever. So in the end, I got 3 tiny tacos for $9...plus tip and tax. Yaaaaay I love wasting money.  Never going here again.

This place is in the heart of Downtown Chandler.  It's like an Irish Hooters, meaning there are scantily clad  female servers.  I'm not into that, being a female, but I still enjoyed the atmosphere.  Dollar bills and old photos hang from the walls.  I got the grilled 4 cheese sandwich.  It was OK, a bit greasy and heavy.  I was searching for a relatively healthy veggie option and its anything but healthy.   Nonetheless, there were other menu items that looked intriguing and I would come back again to try them.

I came here for lunch with a few friends.  There was so much to choose from on the menu.  I wanted to try everything.  I ended up ordering the BLT with the loaded potato soup.  Both were phenomenal.  Me and my two friends split the blackberry bread pudding.  It was so yummy.  I wish I had it all to myself.  I will definitely be coming back to try their other menu items!    Also, the service was great.  Our server Stephanie was very attentive and friendly.

I love to come here for Happy Hour on Wednesday nights.  Boneless wings are 60 cents each and drafts are $3 and I'm not talking about Coors or Bud light.  There is a whole list of craft beers you can choose from.  This place is always packed when I come. Even though it gets so busy, the service is always great.  They manage to make frequent stops to check up on you.

Service is pretty quick and workers are friendly.  They slice their meats and cheeses as they are making your sandwich.  I like the Turkey and Provolone and the bread is always fresh.  Make sure to sign up for their emails.  You will get a coupon for a free sub and drink on your birthday!

I was very impressed with Hole-in-the-rock/Papago Park. Climbing up is fairly easy if you take the back way.  It is a short hike, about 5-10 min. Going up the front is very steep.  The park has several trails and picnic areas.  I saw several little ground squirrels. There are so cute! It is also free to enter the park.  The zoo is right next door so you could make a whole day out of the park and zoo.  Parking is a little confusing though because there is very little signage.  I just parked at the zoo and walked over.

Overall I was very impressed by this hotel.  It's very modern and elegant.  The lobby is grand, there are several good restaurants in the casino area and the hotel is located just off I-10.  I'm not into gambling but I still enjoyed staying here.  There were a few downers.  The place reeked of smoke. If you have asthma or can't handle cigarette smoke, I don't suggest staying here. Smoking is allowed in the casino area and the hotel area is supposedly smoke-free but I could still smell the smoke from my room.  Also, I had a very difficult time connecting to the wi-fi internet.

When I was first seated, I was told that the daily special was either Chicken or Tuna Salad. I got really excited because Chicken salad was just what I was craving.  When the waitress came back, I went to order the Chicken salad and she told me that they did not serve Chicken salad nor have they ever served it.  I was confused and disappointed so I ordered the Tuna salad instead.  It was rather bland and unsatisfying.  The nice outdoor seating was the only redeeming aspect of my experience there that day.

I just moved to Chandler and had to find a new eye doctor.  Sonoran Desert Eye Center had good reviews so I decided to go with them.  The office is very modern and clean.  The staff is friendly and worked with me to get the best price on my glasses and contacts.  There was a good selection of glasses. I found a pair I liked but not in the color I wanted so they checked online to see if the glasses came in the color I wanted.  They found the exact pair I wanted, so they ordered them for me. Overall, it was a pretty pleasant experience.

I have absolutely no complaints about this place.  The apartment complex has a Tuscan style theme.  The buildings and landscaping are very beautiful.  It is a little pricey but well worth it.  There are free wine nights once a week, dinners twice a month and yoga every Monday.  It's a great way to meet people.  I've made so many friends here.  There is such a great sense of community. The office staff is great and the maintenance is speedy.  There are two lavish pools, open 24 hrs and heated during the winter.  The location is pretty ideal; very close to the Chandler Mall, Target, 202 and 101.  I am buying a house soon and I will be very sad to leave :(

Lots of great finds here!  Everything is reasonably priced too. The store has a collection of items from different vendors so there is a wide range of items.  You will probably go in there looking for one thing and come out with another!

I felt like a VIP when I came here.  I was able to score a pass to the front of the line, so I did not have to wait long to get in.  How you ask? Not sure, my friend who I was with has magic club powers.  If you have to wait in the very long line,  I'm sure its not as a great experience as I had getting in. I believe girls get in free and guys have to pay $40; that was the case for that night anyway. I came on a Saturday night and girls received free drinks until midnight.  The club often has DJs come and play music.  Eric Prydz (Call on me) was there that night.  I heard celebrities will make an appearance here once and a while.  I saw Jimmi Simpson (Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) there, not super well known but an actor none the less.  The atmosphere is very posh with pools in the center of the nightclub and cool lighting.  However, do not attempt to go in the pools, you will get yelled at. There are circular cushion chairs you can purchase, as well as tables (for a steep price). I like to track down the photographers at clubs because they take great photos that make anyone look good.    There is an unofficial dress code.  Ladies should wear heels and a dress/skirt.  Guys should wear nice jeans or pants, dress shoes and a button down shirt.

Such a cute, quaint little place!  It's a house converted into a restaurant in Heritage Square in downtown Phoenix.  It's a great place to come for tea.  However, there are very few food items on the menu and they are mostly appetizers.  I would not come here for a meal but rather some tea and a snack.

This location is fairly large compared to other's I've been to.  I prefer this location over the one in Chandler.  There is a lot more to choose from and more unique items.

May 28 was National Hamburger Day and The Habit gave away free burgers.  I had never been here before and a free burger was enough to draw me in.  They were giving away "Charburgers" which are their signature burgers.  This wasn't any ordinary fast food burger.  It was topped with cheese, lettuce, pickles, onions, tomato and mayo.  It was very delicious and just the right size. I took a peak at the menu and saw some unique menu items.  There is a teriyaki and pineapple burger that sounded interesting. I would definitely come back again.

I had never been here and decided to use a coupon from restaurant.com and check it out.  I pulled up into the parking lot and realized it was in a strip mall and there were only about 3 other cars total parked there.  I wasn't sure if it was open.  As I walked inside, I was still unsure.  My husband and I were the only ones there in the entire restaurant (besides the 1 waitress).  Eventually a few more people showed up.  The place needs some tlc. Its very outdated and worn. There was plenty of items from the menu that sounded appetizing and I was hoping this place was just a hidden gem.  I ordered a sampler of egg rolls, fried crab cheese, fried tofu and chicken satay.  Half of it came out burnt.  However, the thai iced tea was very good, and mine and my husband's main course came out hot and tasted fine.  Also, we were able to customize the spiciness of our food.  The waitress was friendly and I believe either a cook or the owner, unsure, came out to ask how everything was.  Overall, I wasn't overly impressed, probably won't come back.  I felt a little sorry for the place.  I can tell they try.

You can really tell the Sushi Room uses fresh quality ingredients.  There are great happy hour specials each night.  Rolls are $4-5.  I tried a few different rolls but the Vegas roll was my favorite.  The atmosphere is trendy and a little more upscale.  I like the giant paper lanterns that hang from the ceiling. On the weekends, I've noticed that the Sushi Room dies down around 9pm because many people will go next door to the Living Room for drinks.  It's nice to have both great places next to each other.

My husband had gone here and raved about this place so I decided to come back with him.  I first noticed the unappealing decor; plastic tables and chairs... However, they also had wooden picnic benches, which were a little more aesthetic.  I also liked the foot handle that they have on the bottom of the bathroom doors so you don't have to open the door with your hands.  The sandwich prices appear fare but once you add sides and a drink to your sandwich, it get's costly.  I did not like that they use disposable utensils, plates and cups.  I understand that they are trying to keep from having servers but Panera Bread uses reusable dishes and utensils and do just fine without servers.  I got the pulled pork sandwich.  It tasted fine at first but then I noticed a strange aftertaste, kind of chemical-like.  The place seemed very popular but I am not sure I would come back.

I had such a great experience here.  I came with a large group so we got the cool table in the back.  The table looks like its very low to the ground but once you get closer to it, you see that there is a space for your legs under the table.  Some people may not like it because it is a little difficult to get in and out of but i thought it was fun and different.  Food and drink prices were very reasonable.  I tried several different sushi that night but the Rice Crispy was my favorite.  The only downer was that we had such a large group (14 people) and they were not able to split the check so we all had to pay in cash. A few people didn't have cash so there was some borrowing going on.

Sunday mornings, there's always a wait to dine here.  People like to look their best for brunch in Scottsdale so you may want to rethink those comfy sweat pants.  There is a large selection of breakfast and lunch items on the menu.  I personally like to order anything that involves eggs benedict. I would not be able replicate theirs at home.  The pricing is ok for the amount of food you get. When a meal says it comes with a side of fruit, they really mean one tiny slice. I am usually still hungry at the end of my meal.  But, I mostly come here for the experience, the atmosphere, and to people watch. Then I go home and eat a little more.

I came here over Labor Day weekend, which bumped up the price from $32, to $64.  I did not find this out until I got to the register, after I had waited in line for 1 hour.  I had already thought $32 was expensive, let alone $64.  The only reason I came was because my friends wanted to come here. After the initial price shock, I was amazed by the endless amounts of food.  It was all very good quality.  Anything you could imagine, they had.  The dessert station was my favorite part.  The waiters brought out unlimited glasses of mimosas and quickly cleared each plate as it was finished off. I don't typically like the idea of buffets, because it promotes eating excessive amounts of food, especially if you are trying to get your money's worth...like $64 worth.. Overall, it was a fun experience, but I would never pay that much for a meal again.

My overall experience here was pretty good. You order from the counter.  The guy at the register that night was very entertaining.  He had several recommendations. Even if you didn't want them, he would magically change your mind. There is a large patio outside to hang out, prices are pretty fair and the food was good.

I came here with a few people on a Wednesday night and we were the only ones there.  That being said, we got undivided service!  I believe the place just had a grand opening as well.  The service was great, they played good music and the prices were reasonable.  I tried the sedona roll, lobster roll, and chicken wings. The food was delicious and presented well.

I was here for a Yelp event.  I did not get to try one of their main dishes but I had their sangria and cupcakes made with their flavored oils.  Everything was quite yummy. I spoke with the manager(I think ?, someone in charge) and she was very friendly. It's a small little restaurant inside the Union at Biltmore. The Union has a very cool vibe. I would definetly come back to try their food.

I am originally from the eastern side of the states.  I am accustomed to Panera Bread. When I moved to Phoenix, I was saddened to learn that there are no Panera Breads in Arizona, only the generic Paradise Bakeries.  I had heard that Paradise Bakery is owned by Panera, but it is no where as good as Panera.  Their ingredients lack quality and it seems like you have to pay a lot more for the specialty sandwiches and salads than you would at Panera. I ordered the "pick 2". I informed the lady taking my order that I wanted to stay within the $6.99 price (its more if you choose specialty items), but I was confused by the menu and I unknowingly ordered a more expensive sandwich.    When I went to go pay, they told me a higher price and I was confused.  The lady (Christine/a) seemed very annoyed with me when I tried to change my order. Over all, she was very unfriendly and she seemed like she really did not like her job.  I specified I wanted mayo on my sandwich, which I did not get and so I had to go back to the counter and bug someone for mayo (there was none laying out to conveniently take).  The guy I asked had to tell another guy that I needed mayo and they acted like it was some grand task. The sandwich was just a slab of deli turkey meat and lettuce on white bread. As part of the "pick 2" I also got the Caesar salad.  It was a large serving but the dressing they used was horrible. This is not an isolated incident.  I have been to Paradise a few times before, and I have never had an impressive experience.

They have the best milk shakes. I will not go anywhere else for one. They come in one size, and it's huge. They are under $3, can't beat that.  The workers are super friendly too.

I was very satisfied with MK Electric.  I was having issues with the outlets in my house and a man named Del came to fix them.  He was very knowledgeable, honest and kind. He was also on time.  I did not have to wait all day for him to come by, unlike many other repair men.

I love to come here to look at all the birds.  They have all sorts of parrots, in cages of course. They are rescue birds and the restaurant has their own bird keepers that take very good care of them.  The restaurant is half indoors and half outdoors.  The outdoor area has lots of trees and with the addition of the mist  and parrots, I feel like I am in the tropics. There is a roof top bar/ lounge area that is kind of swanky.  It's fun to go up there at night. The food is pretty good as well. My favorite menu item are the sweet potato tater tots.   One time I had tripped (due to my own stupidity), and scrapped up my leg pretty bad.  One of the workers ran out to his car and grabbed me some neosporin and a band-aid as well as a bag of ice from the kitchen.  I greatly appreciated that.  The one negative is that there is only one bathroom for each male and female.  You may have to wait in line for 5-10 min on a fri or sat night!

I was a photographer for a wedding that took place here a few weekends ago.  This venue is a little far from any highway. It is located out in the boonies. The area is a little sketchy. The signage for Whispering Tree Ranch isn't very large and you can easily pass it up and may end up in an Indian Reservation. Aside from the interesting journey, this place is very beautiful and quaint.  There are separate cabins for the bride and room to get ready in.  The feel of the furniture and decor set through-out the venue is very vintage. The ceremony area is set under a beautiful large tree. The reception area is open air with stringed lights above. I had a short interaction with the owners and they seemed very nice. I spotted them periodically throughout the event, so they are there if you need anything during your big day.

Finally, quick healthy food. I absolutely love this restaurant.  I just wish there was a location in Tempe. Decor is very hipster. Anything with sweet potatoes is a good choice. I believe they use local ingredients, which is awesome.

The food was great and prices were reasonable.  The atmosphere was lacking a little bit and it was kind of dead.  I assume this might have something to do with their recent relocation. Hopefully this place picks up soon and beefs up their decor.

I came here when they were having a half off everything special.  Even though I was paying half the price, they still gave me great service and spent plenty of time on me.  While you are getting a pedicure, you get to sit in massage chairs and watch movies! I also had my eyebrows waxed.  The lady did such a great job. I think I will return.  Normal prices Pedicure: $24 Eyebrow waxing: $10
