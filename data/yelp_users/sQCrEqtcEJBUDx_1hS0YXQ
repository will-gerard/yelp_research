I go to Welcome Diner so much at this point, I feel like making up disguises. It's like, c'mon, I'm JUST trying eat here everyday of my life and not feel embarrassed about it.   The thing is, they make the best everything I've ever had anywhere.  The Bleu Burger? Omg. The Peanut Butter Bacon Burger? Literally so good, I'm pretty sure I lost IQ points. The Biscuit Sandwiches? I want to be in a Facebook-official relationship with one.  Just go here - you will understand and you will not regret it. Actually, you might regret it, because you tend to go.. no where else afterwards. Just start trying your disguises on now.  Real complaint: They only do breakfast on weekends, doesn't start till 10:30am. More real complaint: They won't let me move in.

SERIOUSLY. TERRIBLE.  My office all ordered from this awful place. Took 1+ for them to make the food.. and drive down the road to give it to us. I can pretty much see this place from my office - what's taking so long?  We get the food (really late), and it turns out they overcharged us. And they forgot an order. My coworker spent twenty minutes asking them to either bring her the food or give her the money back, and they argued with her, said they would bring the food eventually, and then 30+ minutes later IT'S STILL NOT HERE. HOLY CRAP.  All the chicken and pork: overdone. My coworker says the ONLY thing that was even KIND OF decent was the pot stickers.

I literally eat here every day because I work across the street. My company is moving office buildings, and I'm mostly sad to be moving away from Princess. I call everyday and order the same damn thing, it's almost embarrassing.  Everyone there is really cool, friendly, and pleasant every day.  The falafel sandwich is THE best falafel I've ever had.

The Rogue Bar is awesome. The owner is the best.  There's a pool table, there's booze, there's adorable booths for you to sit in and think about the choices you've made. Or whatever. Whatever you want to do.  Coming from a band perspective, this is my favorite place to play in the Valley. It holds around 100 people, the sound system is awesome, the sound guys (ESPECIALLY ANDY) actually give a crap about your band. Which is rare. The stage is raised, and there's a door to load in from the side. Like, everything you could possibly ask for as a local band.  Parking lot is small. My solution would be to park around the corner and not complain about having to walk for five friggin seconds. Jesus.

They do live music here, and my band was scheduled to play recently. In the email in which we were booked, we stated that two of the band members are under 21, but they are 20.  Now, we have played at many venues around the Valley, and it has NEVER been a problem. They put big, black "X"s on our hands, or wrist bands, whatever, and we ALWAYS follow the rules. Once we arrived, they were in frickin' SHOCK AND AWE that we would even be there because of our age. The owner came out to "talk" to us, more like demean us, and told us we can play at 1am, when the liquor license people wouldn't come in. Before he did this, we had offered to stay outside and only go to the stage and out, very politely.  But even after that the owner felt the need to tell us that we obviously don't care about his business, but its WHAT PAYS FOR HIS KIDS SHOES.  Can't imagine how a dump like that even pays for shoes. So we politely declined to stay and do something illegal, and left.  You're right, NOW we don't care.

GET THE MORNING DEW ROLL.  I recommend it to everybody, it is such a delicious sushi roll. I love this place, you can sit outside next to the busy street, or inside. It is a little cramped inside, and the dim lighting and loud music make it hard to have a conversation. This is a place for a night out on the town.  The waiters always have a fine, friendly attitude, and the service is generally quick. They don't take reservations.

AcmePrints was a lifesaver! My band was heading on tour THE NEXT DAY when we realized we had NO large or xlarge shirts. Yeah, we're organized.. Pssh, but that's not the point of this story!  I emailed Dan knowing that it was a pretty insane request, he replied super fast telling me they could do it. A member from his team called me on the phone to discuss the project further, and later that day the shirts were ready! It was seriously unexpected and awesome.  I don't think I could have asked any other screen printer to do this for me so quickly - AND the shirts look awesome.  Thank you Acme!  Chelsey Fairy Bones

I love Camelview. Not only do they show interesting movies, the employees are really nice and the theatres are very clean. The popcorn tastes very good, and I always get a large popcorn with my mum, then bring it back next time for a free refill. Great money saver. AND the loyalty cups are totally worth the first $5.00 you spend, IF you go to the movies a lot, like I do.  Lots of old people and hipsters. Sometimes there's snoring.. I think its from the hipsters.

WORST SERVICE IN HISTORY at the Scottsdale location. I love their food, but it is NOT WORTH the disrespect. Unprofessional, incompetent servers get my order wrong EVERY TIME I go there. I wasn't aware it was so hard to remember sausage over bacon. Ridiculous. When ANY customers walks in the door, they ignore them, and eventually get round to seating them or letting them KNOW THEY ARE CLOSED. Do NOT eat at Over Easy.

My girlfriend and I went here the other day. The breakfast place we usually eat at called OVEREASY has good food but AWFUL service, and it closes at 1pm. We like to wake up around 1pm, so this doesn't work for us. I found this place on the internet and it's close to my house, so we decided to go for it.  THIS PLACE RULES! They have FANTASTIC service! We were chatting with the waitress Stacy for quite a while, and she was so friendly and helpful. My girlfriend ate the biscuit and gravy, which was a meal in itself, and she loved it. I had the classic eggs, hash browns, sausage patties, and toast. My family is from England, and we love bangers and mash, so I am always skeptical about the sausage at breakfast places, but the sausage patties were very good. Kinda spicy. The toast was thick and delicious.  GO HERE FOR BREAKFAST.

I have been to 2012 three times to get tattoos now and everytime they do the most amazing job. First, my friend got a large outline of a tree on her arm, done by Victor, and it was fantastic. My girlfriend then went to get her first tattoo on her side.  Yesterday I brought my friend to get her tattoo redone there, because earlier we had decided getting tattoos in our friends living room was a great idea. Victor did her tattoo, and it took 2 hours. He is so very nice, and professional. My girlfriend and I got tattoos from Roman and he was ALSO amazing! We didn't get appointments, but we called ahead. Totally reasonable pricing, fantastic service, great artists!

This place is FANTASTIC. Tonight my girlfriend and I are going back to eat here tonight. BEST Vegas roll I've ever eaten, and the cheapest! DEFINITELY go here! Friendly service, but very barren. Fill this place up so it will stay around!

LushBurger is the bomb! The Ahi Tuna burger is amazing, AND the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which I have basically every single time now. It is amazing and flavorful. The fries are really great too. There are a LOT of delicious shakes, even red velvet cupcake! My vegan friend had the Inside Out Veggie Burger and LOVED it.. and she can hardly ever eat at restaurants! My friends and I will definitely be back to sit outside, the patio is awesome.

Brandon is a great groomer and human being - and you can tell because people come far and wide to have their dogs groomed by him. Seriously. Like Florida sometimes.  I have been to a lot of groomers, and this place is serene and calm - which really reflects on the dogs. They are calm because the environment is calming. Very important, in my opinion.

The coffee is really good. The iced coffee is especially good.  The crepes are pretty hilarious concoctions. My friends and I call them "stoner crepes." They're REALLY good, just very strange. My favorite is the #9. Just get the #9 and you'll have a good rest of your day.  The atmosphere is cool. I agree with most of the reviewers here, it can seem a little pretentious right off the bat, but the more you go.. the less you care about that.

This place is AMAZING. The staff is friendly, the food is amazing, it's not generally over crowded, and a great place to eat NO MATTER what your diet. Everyone loves this place. Seriously. Everyone.  I don't like fake meat, but my meat-eating friends loooooooove the fake meat here! I've eaten the fake chicken one time, and I literally freaked out about it because it looked and tasted just like chicken. Not for me, but if that's what you're down for - you won't be disappointed. I stick with the house tofu which is equally as amazing.

Carson is the best and the pizza is amazing. Open at ideal times like 4am. That is all.
