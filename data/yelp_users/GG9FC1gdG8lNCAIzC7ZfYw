I would not give a star if possible. I went to the spa yesterday and my skin is completely damaged by the chemicals the technician chose to use when I clearly told her I had sensitive skin. I posted a photo in the photos section. I am appalled a spa at a hotel of this caliber would not properly educate and train technicians to proactively protect its customers. I can't believe the damage. This could take weeks to heal. I called the Spa Director and left a message. I am completely in shock.

I love Ciera! She's an amazing hair stylist and colorist. I went to Vidal Sassoon in Scottsdale before but I switched when I found her.
