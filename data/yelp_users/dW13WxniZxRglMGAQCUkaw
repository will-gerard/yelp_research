This is a place located close to my work. My work has been getting the light bulb replacements from this place for years. I went to get a replacement bulb there today and was given the wrong lightbulb twice and was treated very poorly by the woman behind the counter. She made fun of my name, and my mother for naming me my name. She also tried to blame me for the mistake. We had to go back twice to get the correct light bulb. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless they were a glutton for punishment. The man was very nice. The lady was surly and very unprofessional. Luckily I work very close, otherwise it would have been much more of a hassle. Ugh
