This is not for Dr. Stevens, but for the center's billing policies and staff.  I called to schedule an appointment for surgery but was told I needed another appointment before then. No problem, just schedule me for another appointment.  Not so fast. You have a $22.00 outstanding balance on your account. No problem, can I pay it when I show for the next appointment? No, we're sorry, we cannot schedule you for an appointment with an outstanding balance EVEN after checking with our billing supervisor.  Really? If I didn't like Dr. Stevens so much, I would have switched to another facility.   It's $22 people. Think customer service.

Not the best but not the worst Chinese food.  Had the Schezwan Shrimp for lunch. Egg drop soup was brought out promptly and the main course after two spoonfuls of the soup.  Soup was nothing special. Egg roll almost flavorless and mushy. No ability to substitute Lo mein for rice. Better like rice. This IS a Chinese restaurant right?   Everything came out on same plate. Cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice. Most places serve these separately. Obviously a move to save servers work.  Iced tea was basically water.   Check was delivered halfway through meal. Thank you very much. You may go now.

I didn't notice the menu advice until writing this. Maybe my experience would have been better? Probably the food but I doubt the service. Just a thought, have any of them been to an American restaurant where they give you BOTH menus?  Check was delivered halfway through meal. Thank you very much. You may go now.  Meh

Just like the other reviewers have mentioned, while the food is pretty good, the service and flexibility is non-existent.  I ordered the shrimp and scallop garlic sauce. I don't really like rice and prefer Lo Mein noodles. When I asked for a substitution, I thought the server had seen a ghost. She quickly said. No...they can't do that. I asked not even with an upcharge? No. can't do it.  Wow. I was stunned. I probably should have just left but I took the dish as is. Their motto should be "You get what you get but you don't pitch a fit." Really? A minor substitution like that? The place was fairly empty and it reminded me that again, I need to read Yelp before I go.  Two stars for the food quality.

It's always tough to choose an Air Conditioning company and it usually happens only when it's 100 degrees and it's not working and you're scrambling to find one that can come out asap. This company took care of my system fast and with very professional service. If you're in the Phoenix area and need A/C service, I highly recommend.

One hour martinizing it is not. If you need it in an hour they can't do it. Their excuse? It's only their name! Hey, what do you think you'll get if you went to a place called "one hour oil change?"  Brought in at 10:30 and they couldn't even have it done in 8 hours.  False advertising.

I've lived in Japan and know sushi fairly well. This place has fresh fish and seafood and the pieces are large. Very good. I thought it funny that someone actually gave it a bad review because the pieces didn't fit in their mouth! Lol...crazy.  One of the best and most affordable in the valley.

I've eaten here a few times and each time I ask myself why? It's like I have amnesia in between visits. The food is nothing spectacular and the service is pathetic. I understand it's a family business, but at least have the kids serve at a mainstream restaurant for a few months to learn what they should do, THEN come back and serve. Most seem to be walking around lost and even though they can see the entire place from any location, never seem to look at your table to realize you need something.  I go there strictly for the pies, which I love. I just hope I read my own review at least before I try eating there again.

Great store. Staff is friendly and helpful. The only thing I probably won't use again is their dog grooming service. i've used it a few times (two Shih Tzus) and I can't say I loved the cuts. They looked a bit rushed and uneven. They do have quite a volume of dogs so I'm not sure if that's a contributing factor. No problem though. I get my supplies there and a dog groomer closer who has a little more time to do a thorough cut.

It's been awhile since I've been in this particular Macaroni Grill. That's probably good since I was able to note the significant decline in the food and service.  I was there for lunch. Arrived at 12:45 pm. Slightly less than 50% occupancy in the dining room. My wife and I were seated immediately by the manager who was busy working the tables. As I was about to be seated in the booth, I noted the booth seat was covered in crumbs. The manager wiped it down remarking the busser didn't wipe it down (considering I hadn't seen a single busser, the manager was the one bussing tables).  I ordered the center cut lamb spedini and garden salad. The server asked if medium rare was okay since that's how it's normally served. I was fine with that. Salad arrived fairly promptly but I quickly noticed it was far from fresh. looked like bag salad about 3 days old. Wilted on the edges, limp and of generally unappetizing appearance. I sent it back without requiring a replacement.  Main course arrived and first cut revealed it was well done. I cut a few more. Well done too. Wait...I thought she said medium rare? Cool pink center remember? The server asked how it was and I told her not what was ordered. She returned it (kept the veggies to eat while new lamb was brought back). Replacement came out perfect and was juicy and tender. Previous was quite dry which led me to believe they're pre-cooking their meat, hence the well done as soon as it's heated up.  Manager never came to the table for either the salad or the lamb. in most places, the manager is required to authorize any reissue on plates. I would have been at the table in an instant to ensure I met the customer's concern/complaint. I think he was too busy making busy work. I noticed him walking around quite a bit but only sliding plates around in the kitchen window or placing salt and pepper shakers nicely. He was clueless and it showed in food quality and service. He was sweaty down the back of his shirt which may be fine for McDonalds, but not for a restaurant.  Years ago this was an ememplary dining establishment. Based on recent service I don't expect it to survive unless serious management is brought in.

This was my first time at Cafe Boa and I happened upon it while looking for a late morning breakfast place. Bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry. No butter or jam was offered. We had to ask for it.   One of my big pet peeves: memorizing orders. I'd rather you write it down than try to impress me when you eventually screw it up. Of course our server did. He forgot our orange juice and I had to ask for it. I was really in the mood for what was advertised on the menu as "Fresh Squeezed OJ". A large glass of OJ was brought to the table but if it was Tropicana, they'd be doing at least better than they were. It wasn't fresh squeezed. I asked our server about it and he seemed to fumble for some feeble explanation about the bartender, etc. and sounded surprised. Big mistake to be blaming others. So he finally brings back fresh squeezed and it's a glass about a third the size of of the original.  The food overall was tasty and hot. No complaints there. Service seems to be on par with the other reviews. Our chucklehead was no exception. When he did bring the bill, it was only a total and no itemized bill. Had to ask for that too. I wonder if he'll figure out he'll save himself a lot of work by doing it right the first time?

Okay, a few questions. 1) Why isn't this place advertised better and 2) Why wasn't it packed? I ate there on a Monday evening using a restaurants.com coupon to try it out based on some recommendations. Simply outstanding. The owner, Louis is fantastic and I wish I had his energy even at my age!  I had the fresh Caesar salad, escargot. stuffed mushroom and baked lobster tails. My wife had the Lobster Thermidor. for dessert it was a Grand Marnier Souffle.  I simply cannot say enough about the food. Everything was perfect. I had forgotten all the ingredients that go into a REAL Caesar Salad, but the preparation tableside quickly reminded me what I had been missing from restaurants that use a generic Caesar dressing. The salad was simply out of this world.  Maybe the prices scare off some customers but I've learned most often, you get what you pay for. Definitely applicable in this case. I'll be back...

This is strictly for how they operate their "Call Ahead" seating. Their food is usually impeccable. I will never understand their stupid call ahead, maintain two list, absurd process. I called ahead at 6:50 pm. Was told the wait was 40 min. Great as I would be there in 40 min so I had my name placed on the list. Got there at 7:30 and they couldn't find my name. So they put my name on the "call ahead" list and told about 30 min wait while they were on a 1 hour wait at this point (exactly why I called ahead).  Talked to the "manager" (really just the key server) and she said they did have my name on the "call ahead" list and my wait would be about 30 min. That the "call ahead" list just shortens your wait to about half the current wait. Really? And just how do they go about calculating this? My wife has worked for Outback for over 6 years and says that system is still as screwed up as when they first introduced it.  Here's a novel idea, when someone calls, just put their name on the list! If they're not there when called, skip them, just as if they showed up in person. Really not that hard and you don't have to maintain two separate lists forever trying to explain your logic in doing so to customers.  The truth is, Outback really doesn't care about this system. They're always on a wait so no big deal if customers don't like it and go home. It just reduces the wait time. So we left and went across the street to Gordon Biersch. That's another review.

Great place. Love the small, art festival type theaters over the mainstream ones. This one hit on a gold mine in being the only one in Phoenix to show "Atlas Shrugged." Will be back for the future parts.

After having tried iPic theater in Scottsdale, this was like going from a Motel 6 to the Four Seasons. WELL worth the expense. We were on the side that served alcohol, not the "Fork and Screen" theater.  We started off early getting there before 3pm for a 3:50 showing. Waited in line longer than I would have cared for due to a woman in front of me who had to have the staff person read every summary of every movie showing. To that woman: have some courtesy for others and read it online for yourself or on that cool iPhone you kept looking it. So I found I really waited in line for nothing since if you purchased your tickets online, you could pick them up at the kiosks along the wall. Might have been nice to have a sign conveniently so I (and the others who heard this) wouldn't have had to wait.  I got a draft beer and it was served in an iced glass. Nice. I really didn't expect a theater "bar" to pay that much attention to detail especially after iPic. We were supposed to be able to get our seats at 3pm but when we went in, someone was still cleaning and asked if we could wait. Not a big deal. We were in by 3:10.  Seats. Amazingly comfortable and didn't have a bar going along the back as they did in iPic. Comfortable throughout the whole movie. Our server was prompt and got us drinks right away as well as an appetizer order. That reminds me...the menu. The menu was great with far more to choose from than the 3 items or so I was given a choice of at iPic. There were server call buttons on each chair unlike the "wave them down if you see them" method of iPic. I used it once to order dinner and again, the server was prompt.   Food. Food was hot and very good. Nothing to complain about at all. I had the Chicken Alfredo and my wife had the Mac n Cheese. Both were fantastic and the portions were large.   They even ended the movie with a lemon-scented hot towel! Attention to detail is how you do it and they are doing it great. I purchased a loyalty card since I will be back. iPic? iPic who?

Arrived 10am on a Wednesday and on a wait as usual. There's a reason for that, because they are that good. I waited for about 10 min (only me in my party) and was seated. Server was VERY prompt showing up about a minute after I was seated. She was very pleasant and gave me plenty of time to look over the menu. I ordered the Santa Fe scramble with hashbrowns and pancakes. My order arrived in under 5 min and they were slammed! Food was hot and delicious as usual.   Watching the staff work was like watching a professional sports team. Bussers were clearing tables seconds after guests left and guests were being seated as the busser made his last swipe with the cleaning cloth. These people do it right and if anyone says you can't expect this at less than a 5 star place, they're dead wrong. Point them to Butterfield's.

Okay my first time here and I do not give out 5 stars easily. Even though it's a cafeteria style service, they are quite attentive to you when seated. The food was simply outstanding. If a cafe style place like this can do it, you'd think a full restaurant could as well.

So the history of my reviews will show I typically do not write reviews like this.  My girlfriend and I arrived and were promptly seated. It was about 7pm and not crowded. We ordered the Escargot, Oso Buco, and Fettuccine with Mushrooms and Shrimp. I had the spinach and egg drop soup, her the salad.  The Escargot was very good and we asked for bread. Specifically asked for plain bread (should have been brought out with Escargot due to the large amount of garlic butter that usually accompanies it. Took a long time as for some reason they assumed I wanted it toasted. Not a biggie. Escargot tasted great.  This is where it got bizarre. My girlfriend liked the shells and wanted to keep them for a decoration. Assuming we owned the Escargot we just ate, we asked for a box for the shells. The server stuttered quite a bit trying to tell us the shells weren't for sale. What?? Essentially you RENT the shells and they are reused for other patrons!   The manager came over to see if she could address the issue. I told her we'd like to take the shells and she said it was not possible that they reuse them for other guests. I was so surprised at this and questioned her reusing something like that. It's not a fork. I asked her if they were allowed to do that? In my opinion it's disgusting.The manager was entirely rude and wouldn't discuss it further. One of the worst encounters with a manager I've ever had in my dining experience. She walked off and would not answer me. So much so, I just had to ask for my bill to leave.  The Oso Buco and Fettuccine just arrived at that moment as we told our server (very nice girl who we did tip) we were done and leaving. The manager still refused to speak to me upon departing.  So for the $3.00 likely cost for six Escargot shells, the manager easily lost $40 for the meal, possible returning customers and possible future customers who will read this review. Not a bright business person at all.  The food was good, but due to the attitude of the management, I would never step foot in this restaurant again. They get 1 star....because I have to.

Okay, what could I possibly add to this review that the others haven't covered? I doubt much. I'm Italian and was raised in an Italian part of the city in New Jersey, so I judge every "so called" Italian restaurant by very tough standards and Aiello's passes every one of them.  Joe, the owner, is the real deal New Youk Italian bringing the traditional northeast Italian to the Southwest. Not only is the food true to form, but Joe himself is about as personable an Italian guy as you'd find. You might as well be eating in his own kitchen as far as he's concerned.  I live 30 minutes away and willingly make this trek a couple times a month. It's real Italian and hard to find.

We visited for the first time yesterday having purchased a $10 coupon from Restaurants.com. Upon paying for our meal, we were informed that they would only take off $5 from the meal vice the $10. The reason was rather obscure since the HS kid was only following directions but was something like a previous employee put those out without authorization.  So? You're a business with something put out in your name by a representative of your company. Honor it. I will not return to a business that does not honor it's obligations instead passing its mistakes onto the customer to bear.  I had the Rib Plate, mac n cheese and coleslaw. Ribs were fairly dry with the mac n cheese and coleslaw being more enjoyable. Plenty of better BBQ places around. This one was a dud.

So it's no surprise to me to find this has closed. With management so inattentive to customers and obviously not business savvy, it's no surprise another statistic added to the number of failed startups. No great loss here.

This was my first visit to an Ah-So restaurant and went with a party of 9 for the Teppanyaki style show. If you've been to places like Benihana, you'll probably be disappointed as I was. Not much of a show. The standard egg tricks and that was about it.  I had the Japanese Lettuce Wraps, Samurai Combo and Filet & Scallops. The lettuce wraps were quite good, The scallops mediocre. Scallops were cooked longer than I would have liked. The Filet was very tender and I liked to seasoning they used.  Atmosphere wasn't as cozy and private as you'd find at a Benihana. Price/value ratio was a bit high in my opinion.  Overall, not bad but after living in Japan for two years, not a restaurant I'd go out of my way to get back to.

Could be much better if management focused on inefficiencies. The Express band is a great idea but other areas need focus:  Lazy river. Only one entrance though is is obvious there is another. So instead of having two entrances, the staff would rather have the line extend across the park so as to block main thoroughfare traffic. Very irritating.  Pretzel/churros: Was obviously a popular concession but only a single poor girl to work it and she was slow. The line for that also extended back so far as to block the main thoroughfare of traffic.  Process for passes: This is not explained well at all. Even asking staff was confusing. So if you are totally new to the park and want a season pass, where do you start and where do you go to complete each step? I had to ask each step of the way and still was never quite sure I was in the right line. How about painted footsteps along the pavement that takes a newbie to each of the windows they need to hit?  Food/fries: Like a movie theater, they kill you with overpriced food. Hey....I do not mind paying a lot for food IF the food is worth it. Unfortunately it's not. Cafeteria at best. Fries are old and overcooked. Hotdogs are meh. Nothing worse than paying for a meal and feeling you've been had when it's over.

This place is fantastic. The donuts are fantastic especially the mini crullers (Sunday only - get there early!). The staff is wonderful and always interact with my kids and give them something special. It's a personalized service you just don't get from the large chains.

Second attempt at this restaurant and same poor service. Staff was very slow to even recognize we were waiting at the hostess stand. Finally a server noticed and we were seated. Ten minutes went by and still no one came to greet us or get our drink order. I doubt I'll be back if they can't get on the ball with basic restaurant skills.

I've lived in Greece so am very picky when it comes to Greek food in the US. Most places I've tried have Americanized their menu. Not necessarily a bad thing, but if you're looking for genuine Greek food, it is.  Athena is the real deal. I measure Greek restaurants by their salad. A true Greek salad (horiatiki salata) does not have lettuce. Lettuce is added to appease Americans who associate a "salad" with lettuce. Athena has two salads. One called a Greek Salad which has lettuce (presumably to appease Americans who have come to expect it) and their Greek Village salad which is made EXACTLY like an authentic Greek salad. I was pleasantly surprised. It was outstanding.  Their Gyro is perfect and their Tzatziki is thick like traditionally found in Greece. Their saganaki is made with kefalograviera cheese and finished flambe tableside. Fantastic.  As far as Greek restaurants go, I cannot recommend Athena more.

Well the concept of this theater really appealed to me. I still think the concept is great, however thought in the execution seems to have been absent.  We showed up at 9:20pm for a 9:45pm show. We waited outside the ropes for about 10 minutes until we'd be allowed into our theater. This gave a a few minutes to look around. The theater is linked to both the Salt Lounge and Tanzy Restaurant with coordinated decor making for a very stunning and appealing sight with a comfy feel. We had just came from dinner at Tanzy's (separate review). We ordered the Gold package and were told our server would take care of everything once inside the theater.  Once we were allowed to enter everyone entered the same door. It wasn't until we were trapped in the line that we realized there was another door on the other side that would have sped up the wait to get into our seat. Maybe if they were both open that might have streamlined seating.  we got to our seats, got comfortable (more on that), experimented with the electric recliner and generally got situated. Once our server showed, we ordered. My wife wanted a white wine. The server highly recommended one of their Chardonnays. We learned after tasting that 1) don't take wine recommendations from someone not old enough to drink and 2) iPic doesn't know a quality wine from vinegar. The Chardonnay was easily the worst either one of us had tasted and we didn't finish it.   We ordered Chocolate covered strawberries and the Oreo Ice cream sandwich. Our server didn't know they were out of the ice cream sandwich and told us when she delivered the strawberries. Probably a good thing since that probably prevented another food abortion. The chocolate covered strawberries were also horrible and unripe. My bet is, they're not made on premises but charge as if they were. After just eating at Tanzy, I wrongly assumed the menu would be similar since I believe they're owned by the same. Menu was not great..at least the dessert menu with it's three options. The other option was a Berries Sabayon which the server tried to push after our two previous dessert failures.   Not long into the movie my wife noticed her 3D glasses were dirty. It took about 30 minutes before we saw our "server" again to ask for another pair. The second pair was better but not much. They reuse glasses and the high school kids working there probably aren't too into cleaning them well.  Comfort. I was all set for a nice comfortable recliner. Not. There is a metal bar running across the middle of the back of the recliner that will be guaranteed to let you know it's there by the middle of the movie. I spent the second half of the movie trying to avoid the bar to no success. The only way I was able to minimize the bar in the back was with the foot rest down which kind of defeats the point of a recliner. Since your feet won't touch the ground (and I'm 6'1"), that is an uncomfortable feeling as well.  While the concept is fantastic, the designers and operators really ignored the details. If you build it, they will come is not a good business model. They may come.....once. And once it will be. We will not be back.

Coffee wasn't good, OJ from a machine, Selling other things in a restaurant such as jewelry and art is usually a warning sign of a place not doing well and can't survive on its food alone. I ordered eggs over medium. It's a good test for cooks. Eggs came out over easy and were watery. One plate had actually been set in food from another plate. Bacon was fatty. Toast might as well come from grocery a store. The steak must have been frozen as it was done in 5min. Nothing from this place was something you couldn't make at home.

This was our first time at Tanzy. Not surprising as it's only been open a couple of weeks. Arriving, I admired the sharp decor, fire columns and warm, upscale feel to it. What I didn't admire was what seemed to be a group of hostesses who largely were confused by their job. A bit of arguing and the "head" hostess just finally telling the others to just shut up and let her think. Not good in front of customers.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and were asked to wait in the lounge. Very proper as we were early and when our reservation time we were promptly seated. I could see why the hostesses were confused once I was seated. My wife and I were seated at a two-top and on the other side of the wall from us was a booth that could have seated eight occupied by two people while the restaurant was on a wait. Strange.  We ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprouts (as came highly recommended in other Yelp reviews), Tagliatelle Bolognese and Scallops with Chantrelle Mushrooms. The service was great and our server was pleasant with just the right amount of conversation. The Crispy Brussel Sprouts were outstanding and I only wished I had another order! The Tagliatelle Bolognese was delicious as well and was so large that I didn't know how one person could finish it. Good thing we were sharing. The Scallops with Chantrelle Mushrooms were wonderful, well at least the scallops and mushrooms were. I couldn't eat much of the parsnip pear puree. The sweetness was a bit overkill for the meal as far as my taste was concerned.  The only thing that kept this review from being five stars was the music. It's right next door to the Salt lounge which has heavy techno beat music playing that permeates the entire restaurant making it feel like a club with dinner more than a restaurant with music. An upscale restaurant like this, you would expect something more appropriate. By the end of the dinner our nerves were just about frazzled.  While the food was great, for relatively the same price, we'll probably choose Ruth's Chris over Tanzy. It adds the fifth star for the same cost.

Long wait at lunch. 5 min just to acknowledge I was waiting. Hostess running table tickets, takeout orders and seating tables.  Strange when I'm already eating with chopsticks the server comes over to ask if I want a fork??? WTH? I wonder what kind of reaction I'd get asking a group of Asians eating with forks if they'd like chopsticks?  Ordered beef and broccoli. Tried to substitute fried rice for the steamed rice but no can do. Hint people. Figure out how much additional the same amount of fried rice is and ADD THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE. Telling a customer no you can't do it will ensure one thing: the customer goes somewhere they will. Try visiting other restaurants and see how they do it.  So I got my lunch they way they wanted me to have it. Result? Loss of additional revenue and an unhappy customer. I guess not all business owners actually have business sense.  Two stars only because the food is good. Not great, but good. The service and flexibility to the customer is substandard.

I don't give out 5 star ratings lightly. Less that 30% of my reviews are 5 star, but Sol deserves it. It is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  I have been here a few times and being a new restaurant in the area, have endevored to try different things on the menu. I have yet to find something that wasn't perfect in taste, temperature or presentation. The food on the menu surpasses any typical Mexican cuisine by a wide margin. The unusual pairing of ingredients is sheer culinary genius. I would not have expected goat cheese to be something in guacamole, but I don't think I can have guacamole any other way now.  Their variety of tacos focusing on seafood more than meat is more than welcome. Each is full of flavor that has your mouth watering before it reaches your mouth. The ability to order them a la carte or in a combo should satisfy anyone.  The Ceviche de Coco "Cabo" was incredible. Coconut, fuit, lime, avocado all coming together for a spectacular combination.  The staff is very knowledgable and made great suggestions when overwhelmed with what to try.   The Calamari is some of the best with a unique hint of orange.

I don't give 5 star reviews very often, but Ann's deserves one from me. This was my first time in being highly recommended. I am pretty particular about my Asian restaurants having lived in Asia for some time but Ann's really exceeded my expectations.  I had the Garlic Noodles and asked for chicken to be added. Wasn't a problem (I've actually been to some Asian restaurants that said no substitutions!). The Garlic Noodles were fantastic and an ample portion for me to share with my girlfriend.  Also ordered Combo Fried Rice, Pot Stickers and Coconut Tapioca with Watermelon. Huge portion of fried rice and six pot stickers. Taste was perfect and were served nice and hot. The Coconut Tapioca was a fresh (no pun) way to put these tastes together and was just refreshing for a summer Phoenix evening. Sweet but you didn't feel as if you had to roll away from the table after a dessert. Loved it.  They've only been there 5 months and I can see they will be a favorite of mine.

Food the usual of Paradise. They were out of soup, forgot to make my smoothie.  4 people there, only 2 helping customers during lunch and if they moved any slower they would be stopped. Not many choices in Terminal 2 so I guess they figure you're stuck with them. Next time I'll have my meal on the plane.

Top notch Executive MBA program. Ranked 13th in the world by the WSJ. Staff TRULY makes the difference in a program like this and I simply cannot say enough about the staff here. You won't go wrong choosing W.P. Carey for your MBA program. Outstanding.
