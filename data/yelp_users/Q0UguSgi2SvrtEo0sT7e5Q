Two months looking for a company who could do a hi res scan.     Five minutes of problem solving and finally got my project scanned.  You don't often find companies willing to take the time anymore.  Excellent customer service!

Four years since I've been in an Olive Garden.....now I remember why.  Worse service I have in a while, measly portions (I've seen better portions in an Ethiopian buffet) and horrendous quality and taste.  Even the breadsticks which could have been a plus were stale and cold.  Manager came over and did fix the portion issue which was a plus, but the temperature was still cold, and taste was bad....what was I expecting from the Applebee's of the Italian world.  Roaches and cleanliness were a visible issue as well I'm surprised it was as busy as it was.    Check #42345 if corporate is curious.  This place is embarrassing.  I'm calling the health department.

Coming from Los Angeles where the selection is phenomenal wherever you go I must admit I have slightly higher expectations for a gaming store but here's my brutally honest review anyways;  Let me preface by saying the owners could not be nicer great people who have been into many hobbies for quite some time.  The board game selection is pretty good, not a lot of inventory but very good selections with some harder to find titles.  The gaming section is seperate which is great for players who don't want to be bothered every time someone walks in the door, good selection of terrain, and plenty of tables....even the bathroom was clean.  Lots of stranger type merchandise, zombie mints, and the like I'm not so much into that but I guess impulse buys must sell really well, as they had more of that than anything else haha.  What they stock in regards to Games Workshop related products was not what I would expect from a partner store.  There is a good amount of inventory, but looking for several newer releases, as well as a half a dozen pretty standard sets I could find none of those on the shelves (Although there were a lot of boxes on them).  This also could be dictated by the local market so I don't want to fault them for this it was just different then I am used to.  This is my only real complaint as I prefer to have a good variety of items in stock rather than having to wait.  I wish they had a better painting and modeling section with some different selections and different companies but that may be dictated by the market as well.....They have very standard Gaming supplies by all the regulars.  The owners were also pretty clear that there is little pick up type gaming, and it is mostly scheduled and tournaments which I dislike quite a bit, I think this is mostly because of their hours, and the clientele / gamers this type of hobby store attracts......as much as I hate to admit it I do miss gaming at GW as the enviorment there was much more inviting.  The only other real complaint I had was how much room they had for additional product and how poorly merchandised the store is....again nitpicking but still could use improvement.  This is only a few miles form my house and Ill continue to give it a few more tries but this is honestly making me think about building my own table and starting my own group.

The owners being so personable and really stocking up on what I was purchasing based on a yelp review really deserve the extra star....maybe even another one if it was possible.  Really the only place I go in the valley to purchase gw or specialty type games anymore.....  They probably deserved the 5 star off the bat however coming from an area with better selection my opinion was probably jaded....  The long and short is buy your stuff here the difference in prices between online is negligible and always lower then the competition (cough cough gamers inn) and it is important to keep gems like this in business.

Great complex overall.  We lived there for close to three years and would have stayed if they hadn't hiked the rent up with a new management team.  Very good location very close to freeways and although they do attract ASU students and there is an occasional party things were very peaceful and a pretty ideal clean community where we knew all of our neighbors, and most of the management knew us by name.  Would have gotten five stars except a few issues to be aware of;  If available get an upstairs unit.  Maybe our upstairs friends were just minotaurs but the ceilings don't seem well insulated and often we could hear their children getting rambunctious during the evening.  Never loud enough that it was too bothersome just slightly annoying after a while.  In the three years we were there the hot tub seemed to only have worked for about 2 weeks.....in July.  Everything else was taken care of an fixed very quickly but maybe that was just their Achilles heel....we barely used it but still would have been super nice during the cold winter months.  Overall this place is very good but priced slightly higher than some other comparable communities.....maybe its because of the proximity of the villagio, or maybe it is because they can get away with charging a bit more.... either way we were not unhappy paying that type of rent because everything was safe and issues got taken care of.   There are better communities and there are much worse overall we wish we could have justified staying....wait for the good move in deals we ended up with a great one which made the price difference well worth it.

Yeah so I love pubs, especially ones of the British flavor, and we tried this out tonight and it was a pretty good fit for what were looking for...  Prices were reasonable, and as was the service.  I was extra stoked for River Monsters on the T.V. Quiet Riot, Radio Head, the Scorpions, and Motorhead all within a 30 minute period.  Newcastle on tap, and $2 PBR Pints means this place gets extra thumbs up from me.  Fish and Chips, Deep Fried Pickles all great English food, the whole menu looked and smelled good.  Proper Bar sized pool table looked like it was in good condition and seen some use...another good sign.  I do have two chief complaints though (otherwise this place may get five stars)....  They don't play, and didn't even know about the English Premiership league, and as such aired no football (soccer) games....How can you run an English pub without this...I don't know.....   No taxidermy animal carcass gracing the walls.....again a classic touch that would have gone a long way in my book.  We went on a Thursday and it was pretty busy I'm sure this place get's hopping on the weekend....  A little bit hard to find and a bit of a hole in the wall, this place is for sure going on our regular list.

So maybe Im the wrong person to review a vegan resteraunt, but hey I like to try it every now and again and expand my horizons.....besides I was next door getting my bike worked on and it was close....  We ordered three entrees (which was waaaay too much but hey it all sounded and smelled great so why not?)  All of our meals were okay...but seemed to be one of three things;  So sweet and sticky that it gave me a sugar high like a spent the past three hours watching cartoons and eating a box of fruity pebbles (Mock Chicken BBQ)  Ridiculously Spicy.....(I usually love spicy food and have a high pain threshold for spices but this was ridiculous)....It was like eating a river of peanut flavored magma in noodle shapes in theory delicious but not with whatever spice they decided to 'pep it up with'.....(Peanut Chicken Noodle Bowl)  Salty....Like if my tongue was swimming in the dead sea......with more salt (Waitress Pick I think it was some form of mock Hamgurger?)  Im giving you a 4 as I recognize Vegans have limited choices, it was our first time, and Im not really used to tthe vegan menu but for me I will try another day maybe some different choices.....  Pricing was good, atmosphere was tacky but somehow charming......we will try it again.

This shop is a diamond in the rough....  I am a novice biker at best, but coming in this store Ryan, and the rest of his staff helped me out made me feel super comfortable and made great suggestions for my bike....  Their pricing beat the shit out of other stores in town, and my bike rides better then any of I have ridden before since I had him set it up....It's nice to be able to have such an honest hardworking individual running a small business as it doesn't seem to happen that often any more.  I highly suggest checking him out if you thinking of buying any bike, as their prices are very good, and knowledge is even better....try them out you wont be dissapointed.  It doesn't get better than this if you want to ride....

So I moved here a few weeks ago, and was looking for a new shop to get service at etc.....  Ended up going to the location on university and to be honest at first the service seemed pretty good, however after talking to them a bit more the staff I spoke with just weren't knowledgable, and were pretty cocky to boot (I am no elitist, just a novice biker who like to have some fun).    Bottom Line is if you want an over priced cruiser or road bike this is the place to go...I for one wont be dropping another dollar here.....  For the money there are much better shops in town try Kore Bikes on Scottsdale RD....you will be glad you did.

If you like Elitism, and rude sales people, and inflated prices this is the right place to go.....  Very good selections which sucks because I won't be buying a single thing here after my experience today.  After dropping off my Carbon Wheel to get a new tire fitted, and to be checked I bought a rear brake setup for my Volume, they had a few less expensive ones which seemed perfect for my commuter bike.  After getting home I discovered non of the pieces fit, took proper measurements and came back to exchange for the correct pieces.  What I got instead was major attitude from several of the employees, and they stated that my bike was probably not made right and a cheap piece and that all brakes were universal......what they got was me canceling my tire, and refunding my money for the brake.  I drove right up the road to Tempe bicycle (whom I loathe but also have a lot in stock) who were miraculously able to have the very pieces I was looking for to get my brake setup, for much less....  Seriously this place blows donkeys and I won't be  back here ever....it sucks because their repair staff seemed nice an knowledgable.  Theres better places in town try Kore, REI, or Sport Chalet....or even online, Usually when you have inflated prices the way these guys do the customer service makes up for it.....in this case it does not.   On a side note I am still fighting with them to get the $200 I spent there and immediatley returned it because I found the same product for $50 right down the road at Tempe Bike.....   So far they have given me several excuses as to why they haven't been able to return my money as well as given me a bogus authorization number.....shady business practices from this company buyer beware.

Sweet Jesus....  Dice and Greasy Kulture magazine......Vintage Antiques, Strange Motorcycle Parts, and a whole host of other oddities and an extremely Friendly and happy cat?  What more could you ask for in a place......for me not much else.....the owners are super nice, and we have been in here a few dozen times, it keeps getting better.  If you like the Hot Rod, Rockabilly, 70's Vintage vibe even at all you should check this place out; you won't be dissapointed.

So Gamers Inn is a strange place indeed....  In one sense I am attracted to them by their hours, and model trade in program (more on that later), but in another sense I am repulsed by their horrible staff, and clientele.  Even though this place is horrible, their location in regards to our gamers group, and 24 hours status makes them a necessary evil.  Let's start with the goods;  Good Location, Awesome Hours, Miniature Trade In (in theory), lots of snacks available....yeah thats about it.  Lets move onto the bads;  With anyplace when your open 24/7 the freaks come out....especially when you throw in computer games, card games, and wargames....speaking of the computer games, its almost worth taking a trip just for the smell and the spectacle of 40+ people who havent showered in months covered in greasy microwavable food playing world of warcraft....truly is a site to behold....like something out of the matrix.  Maybe all of their social skills are gone, maybe it is a primitive mating ritual used to attract match.com mates......I dont know but it is disgusting.  The staff here is beyond horrible....rude, mean, and on a regular basis smelling like some serious illicit substances.  I guess if I was sentanced to a minimum wage prison like this I wouldn't care either, but really at least be friendly a little bit....your customers keep you in business (barely)  Selection is terrible.....been for 6 months now on a regular basis....the models and games dont change because they dont sell....because they are 20% higher then any other store in the valley.....The used selection however rotates quite frequently which is great for buyers, however as a seller they give you 10% of what they actually mark them at.....which is pretty high considering what they pay for them.  Good stuff occasionally but for the most part washed out ad paint jobs, horribly assembled models, and undesirables.  Overall this place stinks (literally and figurativly) if your in a pinch at 2:00am and want to get a game with terrain in stay home and use socks....if you want to use their computers dont bother.....some crazy new biological hazards are being secreted by their customers as I type this......if you want to go to play magic the gathering your coffee table at home is feeling neglected.....however if your in a total pinch and all your friends are spread around the valley with weird schedules then maybe come here.....(although we still tend to avoid it)  Overall Im just not impressed....this place kind of sucks, and I have given ample time for it to at least meet some expectations....  I keep going here occasionally but only out of need......two stars for potential to some people.

This place went downhill fast.....well it wasn't exactly a long drop to the bottoms of the barrel but still what was a decent selection good tables and good pick up games has become a shadow of its former self and isn't even worth the five minute drive from my house anymore.  This place once had many redeeming qualities but no longer...here are the major issues...  Staff- unfriendly dishonest slobs who couldn't give a single f*ckk about paying customers Tiny I'm looking at you....waiting to purchase three squads of de and other misc merch yesterday but you were too busy socializing as usual (we waited a full 20 minutes for you).the other dude behind the counter.....well the wheels are spinning but the hamster died a long time ago.  We walked out....again at this point I shouldn't be surprised with the way you treat customers you must give the owner one hell of a reach around while you are pumping his business and reputation into thhe ground.  Selection -has gone from excellent to non existent since the move....this shouldn't be a blip on the radar in the next year as its painfully obvious they aren't restocking anything. And given there prices are full retail (or more in some cases shop around youll laugh) I'm surprised anyone is purchasing from them at all.  Basically every positive from my last review and in general is gone and this has turned into another rapidly failing gaming cesspool.  I hope they close quickly and get it over with.  Two words....game depot enjoy it it smokes this place.

To every one who didnt give the Cinema 5 Stars and another 6th star you are fired.......from life.  This Cinema goes up to 11 if the amazing vintage arcade (Has a Crucial Selections such as Ms Pacman, XMen, the Avengers and DDR), A rampaging Pirate Muppet Like Band in the entrance ( I seriously cant make that up) and Real Pirates as you leave.....  Complete with Strange Life Size Manequins of Presidents, Film Stars, Weird Strange things, and a Lunchbox Collection all round this quirky cinema out.  $3 Prices for movies can't be beat as well, and the popcorn etc all seems fresh......my only complaint is they dont serve hotdogs which I have found to be a staple at other bargain theaters.  The theaters are suprisingly comfortable, clean, and have good sound and picture which is a testament to good management and good staff.....  We are gonna keep coming back here for movies we cant fathom paying full price for.

Dear Friends who work at Genghis grill....you have seen me three times this week and although I am slightly burned out on your delicious Americanized "Mongolian" BBQ I must admit that you have become my new favorite mall fast food.  If you are unfamiliar with choosing your own adventure so to speak, it is a pretty good idea to go mild the first time and go easy on the complexity of your chosen dish.  My Fiancee and I are quite familiar with this sort of food and as such went hog wild and went for broke when piling up the topping and experimenting with the vast combinations of delicious entrees.  Here is our critique.  The Bad;  While overall delicious the sea food selection could use some work, scallops were very fishy (gross) calamari was still frozen, and the shrimp was bland and tasteless.  Took way too long to get both of our meals, one arrived well before the other all three times (read between 5 and 10 minutes) this is dissapointing  as it intrudes onto our date time as one of our meal ends up cold.  The Good;  Steak and Chicken seemed fresh not frozen (although couldnt be sure) tasted pretty good for an inexpensive meal.  Noodles and rice were fantastic!  Terryaki Sauce and Garlic Sauce were a touch salty but again very good all things considering  Staff were very friendly polite, and speedy.  No wait times on drinks or to be seated even when it was quite crowded.   Overall room for improvement but still quite a good little meal if your waiting for a movie.  We will be back several times I am sure.

Holy Jesus this place is awesome....  Never before in my life have I been to a restaurant where we sat down for ten minutes, were the only people in there didn't get served and left....  I have also never been into a restaurant that made Hooters look like a place I would be comfortable taking my grandmother.  The long and the short of it.....if you like anorexic big fake boobed ugly cocaine sniffing waitresses begging for your tips serving you you will probably love this place.  If you like tables that look like they havent been wiped with anything other then a damp cloth this decade to eat off of you will love this place.  If you like food that smells like a used diaper filled with hot dogs and indian food you will love this place.  If you like all of the above at prices that are double the going rate of any other similar restaurant you will love this place.  We saw the big PBR sign and it had a clever name and we pulled over to try it....I will never make that mistake again.  I do not love this place.....at all...... even a bit.  We couldnt stomach even trying the $6 hot dogs (with out fries and Oscar Mayer brand that you pay $3 for 8 at the store)  Overall don't bother.....this place sucks.

Just moved out from LA, and looking for a fun shop with a tradtional influence.....One of the cleanest Shops I've been to in a while, great comfortable setting, I ended up getting a sweet fortune telling Liger from Joe and it came out great... Tony's work precedes him and speaks for itself as easily one of the top portrait artists in the country.....Looking forward tog etting lots more work here.

Why haven't you been here yet....no really ask yourself....why?  Hands down the best haircut Ive got in years.....and as I continue going it keeps getting better.....and better. Issac is good news, Kolby is good news.....masters of their craft in every way.  They should be charging double for the prestige and quality of their haircuts, and honestly I would probably pay it.  However Electric Haven is not just for haircuts....  Where they really shine is the quality of Tattooers.  Adam needs no introduction from his time spent at No Regrets however IMHO although an awesome artist is not my first pick.  KC Lange is my go to guy.....after having him put several pieces on me I am 150% stoked to reccomend him to all of my friends, and continue to do so daily.  His work is fresh, clean, awesome color, and a huge range of styles that hes comfortable in makes him an excellent choice for a first tattoo, or to add to a growing collection.  I wish I had four thumbs so I could give him Four Thumbs up......  Travis is another excellent tattooer.  I'm snagging my first piece by him this week, and am positive I wont be dissapointed (given his awesome demeanor, and killer portfolio)....  All around great dudes, great shop, and a positive atmosphere to boot.....get tattooed here, get your hair cut here......you won't regret it.

Initially I thought that I would be giving the new management at Toyota Riverview a five star rating but after the month of shenanigans they put me through after buying the car....just wasn't worth it.  There are dozens of other dealers in the valley, and until they can figure out another finance manager and better attention to detail I would walk away quickly from this dealer.  I want to preface that Bruce as a salesman was wonderful and contributed the one star to this rating...that being said;  Walked in with 4k down on a used Tacoma, let them know my credit situation and what was needed on their part for me to purchase from them... at first they were extremely up front and honest, and very willing to help; the second we had a 'deal' and I handed my cash over the entire tune changed and no one at the entire dealership could pick up the phone, return a phone call, or figure out finacing for a month.  I don't entirely blame the sales department as there really is little they could do about this situation, however maybe inter-department communication or meeting are in order?  Something?  Travis their finance manager is a Snake.  A dishonest cold hearted excuse for a human being who lied to me from the very first words that come out of his mouth.  I am usually a good judge of character and should have walked away, but was stupid enough to allow him to manipulate my contract using none of my down payment on the car itself and rather putting it into ridiculous over priced closing costs, unecessary warranties (I only authorized gap insurance) and hiding through paperwork that appeared to be re-done from the version I initialed.  Totally my fault for allowing myself to sign paperwork like that and I screwed myself in that regards....  Needless to say I ended up at slightly over sticker price financed on a car I dropped 4k on....tax and closing fees and $600 Gap insurance on a $14k car does not = 4k....I'm sure they pocketed a very nice commission on top of the money made on the car.  Second problem.....the car itself.  One expects when you purchase a used car there to be minor issues with it.  Especially when buying from a dealer, (And what was supposed to be a reputable one at that) at Kelly Blue Book Value.  The car was detailed before I recieved it however they did miss the pack of Virginia Slims, goodwill purchases, and misc subway wrappers hidden under the back seat.....that lack of detail made me wonder what else they missed so after bringing it to a mechanic the answer was brakes at 40% a slight warped rotor, desperate need of an alignment, a new oil filter, new spark plugs, and tire rotation...should be nice additions to my car payment on a certified used vehicle.....what a joke.  Im really pretty upset about the whole situation as it left a very sour taste in my mouth....there are tons of other dealers to choose from just minutes away.....choose wisely.

I dont understand the bad reviews here....I have been to many a surplus stores filled with nonsense and this is one of the few I have ever been to where every item (well 90%) is crucial.  Maybe I've been watching Bear Grylls too Much, maybe my Air Force Nostalgia Days are creeping up on me....maybe I just wanted to buy a purple heart and pretend to be a maple syrup conglomerate....All of these things this store fufills....  I came out of the store with a few bandanas so I could rep my hood, a kill em all let god sort em out shirt (which I plan on turning into a sleevless), a knife that is also a lighter, and some rope.......I passed on the camo netting this time but next time it may make an appearence in my shopping cart.  Good prices, nice staff, good selection, no nonsense.....I like it anyways....wish they had more digital camo but thats about my only complaint....  4 Stars for potential to grow as I love the warehouse style surplus store, and there was no vintage miltary vehicle parked out front.....

Well Dang I guess I wont be first to review haha.....  Apparently Hula's reputation precedes it.  The fun vintage atmosphere combined with an excellent wait staff, good mix of cocktails, and a great fairly diverse menu makes this place a 5 star in my books.....  Fun Vintage converted Garage (I think?) a nice older notstalgia with a modern twist the name says it all.....  I ordered a Griled Mahi Sandwich, Court ordered a Cheeseburger (we are creatures of habit)......let me tell you it may have been one of the best meals I have ever had.....literally.  The drinks were very well mixed (yes it was the middle of the day but were no drunks...) Just strong enough but you could taste the layers....and they knew how to make a fogcutter which is a staple of 1950's Tiki bars.  Sweet potato fries with Wasabi Ranch Dipping sauce gets extra point for being unique (as if 5 stars wasn't enough).  I do think the food has quite a sophisticated taste for being pretty much Burgers and Fries....it was a great lunch although I have heard this place gets elbow to elbow at night and on weekends.......best to hit it up when its not so bust IMHO.  Great Value, Great Food, Great Service = Zero Complaints....

Small intimate club setting....check  sweaty as balls....check  shitty crowd capacity....check  hardcore, punk rock, and metal shows......check   Im in.....however it doesnt take much to please me when it comes to shows and to be honest the sound quality was excellent for such a small club I was suprised to say the least.  That and the fact that its biking distance from our apartment make it an easy choice....

Facts about this club;  If you can't go to a show without a drink you should already be in AA.....seriously look at yourself in the mirror, your life shouldn't revolve around alcohol and if it does there are bars a stones throw away.  We live in Arizona....my freezer and swimming pool are sweaty in the summer.  Pack 300 kids into a Terror show in July and watch how quickly the stage dives stop....worth the price of admission every time.  If you don't understand how awesome it is to have an all ages club support the scene you should re-evaluate you concert descision making and stick with creed and avenged sevenfold.  If you complain about the restrooms in any concert venue you obviously don't know the struggle and losing battle it is to work a service job in any aspect.   It's grungy but so are its patrons.  It's light years ahead of the porty potty you suffered through at warped tour, and if you hit it at the beginning of the night often smells like a mystical pine filled forest covered in bleach.  The sound here is awesome, so is the PA, and so are the sound dudes....although when bands bring their own sound people it can be a crapshoot.  The acoustics upstairs are incredible.  This place is one of the last true DIY venues in the country, and is seriously awesome.  Party on Wayne support your local scene.

You people cannot all be serious....  After being lured in by the clean signage (which looks remarkably similar to gamestop... in fact this is originally how we found out about this place...) the simple menu, and a decent smell I must admit I am completely dissapointed.  Court ordered a 1/3 while I splurged for the 1/2 pound burger, we mixed it up with sweet potato fires, and onion strings what we found was the following.  Every person who eats here must be;  Fat and used to having to dig around the grease pool our burgers were swimming in. Stupid by being conned into paying $25 dollars (we shared a drink) for $5 worth of burger materials and $2 worth of the measliest portion of fries possible....  My 1/2 pound burger was flat as a pancake and had literally 2 inches of meat in a ring around the bun.....slothered with a sickening sweet BBQ sauce, cheese and a single onion string, it had completley (I mean literally) soaked both sides of the bun with grease to the point where I removed the bun and squeezed it our as you might ring out a towel.....gross.  The onion strings were okay for pre bought stuff, you can get the same thing at chilis except they charge $1 less and actually strain them before serving.  Courts burger at least fit the bun (points for that) but was salty as anything which suggests they are keeping the meat way longer than they should......same issues with the grease.....literally I feel acne growing on my face just thinking about it....  The sweet potato fries were uninspired and greasy again, I have never had a bad sweet potato fry until yesterday......I guess it had to happen sooner or later.  I must admit after eating at literally hundreds of burger joints this is by far the worst which is sad because there is major potential  We got about halfway through our meal before we couldn't stomach it anymore....I have a stomach of iron....and felt sick all day after eating just 1/4 of a burger and a few onion strings and fries.....  Main Complaints;  Grease and Ingredients Measly portions of sides (for $3 a side I would expect more....) Smallest Drinks I have ever seen ($3 for a 'Large' for what McDonalds calls a small.... come on people)  Long story short if this was my only option I would starve.....best of luck to all you facing this grease burger the only thing I wanted to smash after finishing was my face into a toilet bowl.....

Utility Board shop I have given you well over a dozen chances but lets be for real you suck, and here's why.  I am fairly into surf and skate as of late, everything that you have in your store (and by everything I mean the mediochre picked over selection with no size runs, outdated (see 3 or more season old) merchandise is overpriced.  By merely stepping out of your doors and walking one store to my right I can enter Journeys where a pair of vans is a full $7.00 cheaper, a pair of toms is $5.00 cheaper, and the staff is helpful.  If I wanted to spend less then that a quick trip to Amazon of google shows similar lower prices with (gasp) free shipping and no tax....  P.S. Guys your not fooling anyone anyone who is familiar at all knows most of the inventory is New Old Stock bought at sample sales from the numerous companies you carry.  Some of it is up to 6 years old or more and there still trying to attract full retail, when the buyer has paid pennies on the dollar for it.....Just a FYI to anyone doing there homework.  Your Staff....while I understand the need to employ individuals paid at minimum wage or maybe less, the least you could do is ask them to not  contradict themselves on store and return policy (clearly stated on your website) and perhaps have a bit more personality and a customer is always right philosophy?  Here's why I think that and although not entirely your fault I'm pretty sure a few months aggravation could have been avoided by taking an extra step to actual do your job and service your customers.  Example (One of several as I did try to remedy this with them on many occasions)  I bought a Nixon Watch for my Fiancee while in your Store November 26th 2009. I came in November 30th 2009 when I got home and realized the watch was damaged (You pulled it from your stock and wrapped it up immediatley) I asked for a refund (for store credit or a new watch) and you told me it was a Nixon warranty issue and gave me a number to call to have it sent back.  After they repaired or replaced the watch you would be able to return my money in the form of store credit. I (at a $25 service fee and $5 shipping fee) sent the watch back to Nixon and waited 2 months to get back the broken watch.  I brought in said watch and asked to get store credit and pick out some other merchandise but mysteriously your policy had changed and we were stuck with the watch. (A repaired) but still paid an additional $30 out of pocket for an issue that was your fault in the first place.  Now this is not the end of the world ultimatley we have a decent watch that I paid 30% over fair market value for and had to wait two months to get, but for me the audacity of your staff, and the demeanor each of them had towards this problem was more then disturbing.  Now I am pretty sure I won't sway everyone's opinion as the sweet ASU jocks think this is a local store (its a chain just like the rest of them) but I encourage you, if you like surf and skate even at all do not give a single dollar of your hard earned money to this store.    In fact I will go further to say that because of this experience and my disdain for this store I will personally pay anyone who e-mails me with a reciept from another store and the explanation and understanding that they will never shop here $5 via paypal or similar.   If that doesn't persuade you to go somewhere else I don't know what will.  Screw you Utility Board Shop, enjoy Chapter 11.

If your here you already know that this is hands down the best spot in town.  Every artist here has a reputation that precedes them and are amazing in a variety of unique styles.  I've been tattooed by Kitt Kaufman, and Paul, and looking forward to collecting some more cool pieces by everyone else who works here.  You can't say a single bad thing about even one of the artists as they all bring tons of experience and a unique vision to your tattoo ideas.  What a difference this shop makes in shattering the stereotype of a tattoo shop.  110% recommended to anyone looking to get anything from that sweet Pinterest infinity sign, to that LOTR themed back piece.  With a new camelback location it's only a matter of time before Golden rule takes over the valley.

To all other apartment managers, and communities please take note; this is how an apartment should operate, and this is how a management team should take care of its residents.  First let me get with the few (very few) negatives.  This is an up and coming neighborhood; their are a few slum communities adjacent to it, and some less than ideal neighbors but this community is on the absolute cusp of this and although they attract the occasional vagrant (see item 2 below) this is not the fault of the apartment and given the gated community, amenities and the price this fact is absolutely negligible.    The majority of residents are incredible, we know many of our neighbors and they are fantastic professional nice people however there is the occasional bad egg.....unfortunately we have had to make several noise complaints to one particular neighbor who thinks its a great idea to beat his girlfriend at 2 in the morning and then blast hip hop with his sub woofer....one bag egg doesn't spoil the bunch as management has been great about trying to help resolve it.....point of this is the walls are a bit thinner than I had hoped and the hardwood floors allow noise to carry a bit further. Something to be aware of if you want the beauty of hardwood (and dust bunnies).  For the good, you cannot beat how immaculate the grounds are kept, how fast the maintenance team takes care of any problem (with a smile which goes a long way), and the condition of the gym and common areas.  I have never been to a gym that had such well maintained equipment and smelled so clean (I hope they have stock in glade plug ins).  Overall the management, maintenance, and community care about these apartments and don't think of it as a just a job.  They are receptive to their residents and make positive changes that you can see the very next month many times.  The location is excellent only minutes into Scottsdale and Arcadia, as well as only a quick jump to ASU and Tempe.  My commute to ASU was less then when I lived three miles closer by Tempe Marketplace.  Overall this is a great community and I am confident if they keep going this way some of the issues that seem to have plagued them in the past judging from other negative reviews will dissipate.  We have been here close to a year, we have friends who have been here 3 years and we plan on staying for quite some time.

Just a quick update.  A year after moving out I had a PayPal package delivered to my old address, and not only were the staff able to trace it and contact the resident to get it back, they stuck it next day mail for me at no cost.  Truly above and beyond customer service even after I left.  Again take note this place is awesome.

Great customer service, very good deals to be had, and a constantly revolving inventory make this one of the best stops to make in Phoenix.  I try to make it here a few times a month to catch some of the deals they consistently have.  Check out their crossroads of the west booth if you can; it is when they bring out the best inventory and often the best prices.

Good price, small shop, and knowledgable staff.  They could benefit from more inventory and a bigger easier to find location but given how awesome they have been on my past three handgun purchases from them I'm sure it won't be long before they upgrade.  One of the better small stores in town if your not looking for something specific.

A legit taste of the East Coast right here in Tempe.  Excellent pricing, excellent food, and the best value for the money anywhere.  Come early and take advantage of the ridiculous breakfast deals.  This place is as good as it gets....literally.

Pretty sure no one reviewing this place has ever been to a venue before.  Or maybe its just me.  Staff is pretty Rad, and always books good tours and packages, great for the local scene and a good place for bands to get their chops.  Sound upstairs and downstairs is usually excellent, and although it gets hot in the summer its always a good time.  Anyone complaining about the sound (looks like alot of you) is probably in one of the local bands who cant play their instruments or one of the touring primadonnas who aren't sure how to do a proper sound check or work a mixing board.    Overall great place, and one of the last true DIY venues in the country.

Facts about this venue;  Pros; They get great shows. The venue is now a lot bigger. You can actually park in the parking lot as it fits more than 30 cars.  Cons; They have literally the worse staff in the industry. (Literally) The new venue itself is in a terrible location. Sound system is not really on par with what expected compared to old club red which was always good.  New location should have meant getting better, and growing.  It feels like they took several steps back, or bit off way more than they could chew with the way this place is now run.  I will still attend occasionally but greatly prefer other venues like crescent, marquee, and the nile.

After experiencing the latest and greatest this place has hit the one star category.  Updates;  Sound system in a 1992 Honda Civic sounds better than this garbage.  They have hired nazi mall cops as security.  Parking lot gets very sketchy at night.  All the good shows have moved back to the Nile and rebel lounge.... Spend your money elsewhere.

The short review....NO.  Don't order here.....  I wasn't bummed out when it took two hours to arrive. (I live 2 miles away) I wasn't bummed out when it arrived cold.  I wasn't bummed out when the delivery kid was a total asshole.  I was pissed when I actually saw my food.    If you like receiving a single chicken nugget slathered in Siracha when ordering 1/2 dozen hot wings your gonna love this place. (Literally a single chicken nugget about half the size of a golf ball)  If you love a measly portion of uncooked pasta and a single piece of meatball (read actual part of a meatball) slathered in store bought sauce, your probably gonna love this place.  If you like still frozen walmart cheesecake squirted with some kind of strawberry jam, your probably gonna love this place.  That and the fact that this was stupid expensive....I will continue ordering from Rosattis and more reputable places.  They did offer to give me a credit, but seriously why would I ever try this again....the service was bad, the food was much worse....

Vegan Pasteries, amazing coffee, a constant stream of community activities like game nights, art classes, movie nights, and live music!   What's not to love.  Glad I found out about this spot it's truly an incredible to have this as part of our community.  Definetly made this a pet of my morning and evening routine!
