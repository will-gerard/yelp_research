Only because I had to give it a star.. So first issue was chips and salsa.. Obviously salsa was made from canned chili or it sat for a long time.. Mushy and lacking in flavor. Chips were freezing cold, and greasy.. Not the good greasy, but more saturated..  I ordered the green chili.. Horrible, it was old meat, plate was cold, sauce was split.. Hardly consumable. Ate two bites and moved on.  Carne Asada mini tacos, meh.. Meat was again old and very dry.. Like eating sand. Yikes.. Limes were old, table wobbly, service was decent, wait was too long and I won't be back.  Overall not a good experience.

I love this place! The gentleman behind the counter is amazingly funny and was entertaining the customers as they came in. The food is authentic and made very fast! I love their house fried rice and their chicken teriyaki is awesome! Would highly recommend this place for a neat fun night!  Very good!

Been going here since the Change from Armando Brothers as that place is HORRIBLE  !! Hands down Way better now! I get the shredded beef tacos almost every morning, in fact I turned my whole office on to this place and they all go there now.  Good pricing, huge burritos, VERY friendly staff, and a willingness to substitute and flexibility to make the customer happy. If you have a couple bucks and are in the area give this place a shot. I personally love the tacos with red sauce!   5 stars cause I do do anything halfassed

Food is great, service is a joke... I've been going here for about 7 or so years and I must say... The service has seriously gone down hill.. I know it is family owned but I think the owner needs to have a chat with his staff.. I took my kids in there and saw they had a kids size bean burrito.. Asked if I could get a breakfast burrito that size and was made to feel stupid by the larger employee who worked there.. He looked at me as if I was speaking a different language, he could have been polite with his answer, but no, he was rude!  They also have an issue with being lazy, open at 8:00 am on Saturday is fine, but be open at 8:00am and not pick and hang up the phone twice! It's sad because I've met the owner and he is nice and the food is pretty decent, but I'm gonna have to take my weekly burrito orders somewhere else :(

Re-review love this place again. Had my favorite burrito again. Service great, made sure I was happy after the meal! I missed my green sauce! They seem to be back in step! Can't wait for my Saturday morning hung over burrito order!

Really can't say much bad about this place. Went with family, had a extra large sausage pizza. First let me start off. I'm a snob, I only put stuff in my mouth that is good as I have a problem with eating bad food. I enjoyed it. The sauce is a bit sweeter then what I'm used to, but good. The crust is crispy, New York style. I ordered the lasagna. Much to my surprise, it was also delicious! Down side, beer snob, and not a huge selection, but seems like a nice place to relax. The older gentleman was super nice and overall a good experience. Kinda shocked at the reviews on here. If you want crappy pizza go to pizza hut. If you want good pizza stop here.

I usually whine and complain about places, but I can't with this place.. Great service the ten or so times I've been there. Portions are huge, my two girls and I can share two orders and still have left overs. I love the fresh hand pull noodles.. The prices and varieties are great, for those who rated one or two stars I really think you need to give this place another shot..   I usually have the beef with fried noodles, dumplings. It is all good at a great price.

Absolutely a great place.. I have been coming here for a while to get my car cleaned. Today I woke up to find someone scratched the hell out of my car, I took it in, and they were able to wet sand it and buff it out to almost perfect. They were amazing and I was a basket case because the car is brand new and the entire passenger side hood was beat. Did a great job. Bottom line is that I will continue to use this place for years to come

This place is awesome. Found it on accident a couple months ago. I am super impressed with the attentive attitude of the entire staff to make the customer happy.   So far everything we've ordered is amazing and we'll keep going here!  Thanks

This place is great. The staff is super accommodating.  I've been there a handful of times. Food is amazing. The carne asada is delicious and seasoned perfect. I love the barbacoa, it's tender and delish. Pricing is good, salsa bar is fresh, and kitchen it's clean. This is one of those consistent places that you'll get good food at.
