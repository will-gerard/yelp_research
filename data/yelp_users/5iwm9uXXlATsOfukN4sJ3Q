Decided to try this noodle cafe and was highly disappointed!   I've had my fair share of different types of authentic noodles and came in wanting to try a noodle bowl of some sort but decided on something completely opposite based on the confusing menu.    They have Italian pastas and then they have their noodle options which were confusing. No pictures of the noodles but minimum description. I went with something I was familiar which was curry.    Asian places usually have good curry and different options also. This place only had one curry option. Their menu states: chicken, beef or pork (I forgot which), and katsu shrimp. I thought it was just the shrimp that was 'katsu' or having breading around it, BUT it was all of the meat options I suppose.   I don't like katsu. Had I known I would have not ordered this entree. The curry alone was not appetizing. My food was lukewarm if even warm. The only good thing about my food was the rice. It is very different from the other curry dishes. My plate looked as if I didn't even touch it. There was a manager on site, standing by the hostess stand, which was next to our weird seating arrangement.    You would think If someone left with a plate full of food that something is wrong and you would ask if everything was okay but that wasn't the case.   Not recommended by this Asian.

My friend and I went into this Ulta location because she needed a new mascara and had heard about this new brand she wanted to try out. Upon entering the store, no one was there to greet us and being new to the store we walked around aimlessly for a good 10 minutes before we found what we were looking for. No one asked us for help and no one was really around.   I was pretty shocked by the lack of customer service as I too was looking for a specific eyeliner and had no help in service so I decided I would look elsewhere and waited as my friend found her mascara.   When we got to the register the lady was kind but didn't offer us the rewards program they have going on. The only reason my friend was able to sign up was because she had heard about it and asked about it herself which prompted the lady behind the counter to then give a bit more information about the program.   With the media so much glorifying beauty I found it hard that this beauty salon had horrible service

I love a good sandwich shop! I really love Basha's deli and have been getting their sandwiches for lunch almost everyday when I lived out in Pinal County. I can hardly find a Bashas here around Phoenix but was waiting for a friend getting her oil change done on Camelback and seen this sandwich shop close by. We decided to check this place out for lunch wanting something light and this is one of the best spots we've been to for sandwiches! You get to pick what kind of bread you want along with meat. I went with the smoked turkey and added sprouts and avocado. My sandwich was so delicious! I'm glad I know a good place for a sandwich now!

It was around 930pm and I needed to get some notecards ASAP! I lost track of time shopping and didn't know how late it got. Seen that CVS was open and walked in.   Super friendly cashier and opens late! Plus in my book!

Cody was our server. We both checked in and there was an offer for a free refillable beverage. He comped one of our drinks.   We decided on our entrees and had ordered. Cody walks over a few minutes after and apologizes to us for stuttering because he just worked a grave yard shift the night before so he is kind of out of it. We didn't mind.   There could have been a mix up with my order but I'm glad Cody made sure what my order was the second time before an error occurred prior to meal delivery.   The food was good and I enjoyed my meal as well as my bestfriend.   It wasn't busy for a Saturday evening. The hostess was kind.

Dr. Tang and staff are all wonderful! I yelped a few dentistry before I found Dr Tang and decided to give him a try. I first went to his Maricopa office location but later moved to Glendale. He has another location in Gilbert which is still far for me but closer than Maricopa so that's where I go now.   I drive all the way to the Gilbert location to see Dr Tang because he is great and it's always hard to find a good dentist to trust. He really takes the time to remember his patients as he always asks me about my job and how I'm doing when he sees me again. His staff are always so friendly and you can tell they all have a good relationship with one another.   I highly recommend him as your dentist!

I accompanied a friend as she came in to Brake Masters as she needed her front breaks done. The quote was much cheaper than what the dealer was asking and she even managed to get her alignment done as well as her break fluid flush for much cheaper! I'm very surprised by the service she received and at such a good price! When we walked in there was only one man at the register but another guy from the garage immediately walked in and asked if he could help us. Also upon returning to pick up the car, they were really prompt about helping us out!   It didn't take long to do the brakes and they even called and confirmed the price before starting. I know where to bring my car in for brakes next time! Really glad I found out about Brake Masters!   Oh and the brakes are lifetime warranty! You can bring your car into any Brake Masters!

Came in for dinner around 9pm. My friend and I ordered off the 2 for $25 menu which comes with our choice of entree and shared appetizer. We decided to share the boneless wings. They forgot to bring our side of celery. We both ordered the chicken and shrimp skillet and also noticed the skillet wasn't sizzling.   Both of us were thrown off by that. Our server was all over the place and seemed very overwhelmed as she was pacing back and forth between tables. We observed that she was also training another girl.   Our food wasn't bad but it wasn't hot either which should have been the case because it was on a skillet. Also the potatoes were cold.   We were waiting to pay for a while and then noticed the option to pay via electronic device on the table and chose that route since it was getting late. Our server came over and said she will print our receipt. I left the option on the computer for zero tip because I had cash. I looked over at the server and she looked over at us in disgust assuming we weren't going to leave tip and pre judged us. She then handed the receipt to her trainee and mouthed something to her. The trainee was the one who brung the receipt.  What a way to represent Applebee's with a service like that. I wouldn't want to be trained by someone like the server we had and experienced. Who knows what kind of service you will get

Isaac the "supervisor" was anything BUT a supervisor. He did everything in his power to try to not price match me the price that I was owed. If Best Buy promotes price matching then fucking honor the price! There was picture proof and online proof but he did not honor the price anyway because he was having a bad day. Screw the management at this location!   Very poor customer service for a location that is customer populated!

My bestie and I visited Arribas for Taco Tuesday!   We arrived around happy hour (3pm) and ordered the 12oz margaritas for $1.99 and the Tuesday special which is 2 tacos with a side of rice and beans for $5  The food was very good! The tacos were delicious and so was the rice and I'm usually one to be picky about my rice. The beans I didn't care to much for but prior to entree they serve chips with salsa and some sort of bean dip which I did love.    The margaritas were pretty strong and I normally drink strong liquor. After 2 12oz margaritas I felt buzzed already.   We sat at the bar section and it wasn't busy at all and servers walking around everywhere. Our server was sitting behind us in the booth talking to someone. She left our bill on the table when I still had a full glass of margarita left and still my platter on the table, I didn't appreciate that

Came in on a Thursday night and it wasn't busy at all. We chose to sit outside and there were misters all around. The mist was nice but the table got pretty wet.  I would imagine it would be better during the day when its really hot.   Our server was friendly. I ordered some naked wings and naked shrimp which hit the spot!

Came in at 10pm on a Saturday night, there was 1 group in front of us and the hostess said it would be about a 10 minute wait. The busser was cleaning tables sloppily as when we were seated 20 minutes later, our seat was still wet with water spots everywhere. There were THREE tables open but no one was being seated. The line kept getting longer behind us and no where to stand.  Once we were seated our server was very friendly and consistent in checking on us.   The food was amazing as always! You can never go wrong with their chicken and waffles. The koolaid which comes in a variety of flavors just tops it off! Highly recommend trying this place out!

It's nice that they opened today on Presidents' Day (Monday) when they normally only open on weekends. Found some specials online and they had a deal today as well as other days. The festival was packed like it was a weekend but not too crowded where you can't get by. It reminded me of a theme park because of how huge it was. They have MANY varieties of foods of choose from and many shows! Make sure you come early so you can catch a few of the shows. They tend to be a bit long.   The joust tournament was fun to watch and is the highlight of all of the shows. There are three rounds and the last showing was at 5pm. They close at 6pm.    My friend and I had the spinach and artichoke bowl, the turkey leg, and the loaded baked potato to share and it was a very good portion of food for each item. And only cost us $15   The smores on a stick was delicious also! Along with the caramel turtle pecan   I'm hoping to come back on another weekend this year to catch more shows!

I visit this Panda Express quite often being that it's very close to the house. For healthy eaters they have some pretty good options. My go to is always the chicken teriyaki but without the sauce. It's my favorite protein of choice but the chicken and mushroom is another favorite of mine. They also have the option for brown rice which is always nice because most places don't have that option. The lines are fairly long but it goes by quick. I've only dined in once and it was pretty clean.

I came here for my best friends nieces birthday party. All I knew about this place was that is was an amusement park. In my mind I'm thinking of a small little kiddy zone. I was wrong!   This indoor amusement park was HUGE! I was blown away by the many rides and games! The unlimited buffet was even good! Their pasta was good for being 'unlimited' and usually buffets never meet my expectations. They also had pizza and salads and of course dessert and a soda machine.   There is a bar also for alcoholic beverages for adults and a sports bar. There is a movie room for kids.   The rides were unlimited and I even went on some of the rides with the kids and so did some of the parents. They have a mini roller coaster that is actually really fast and enjoyable to older teens and adults as well which is nice. Their laser tag arena is cool, too!   This is a cool place to host a birthday party!

A very intimate setting restaurant. It's very dimly lit inside. There is a bar area as well as a dining area. They offer appetizers but are well known for their pasties. I tried the chicken tikka masala pasty and loved it. It's a very decent size portion and comes cut in two halves like a pizzone. Will come back again to try the other selections!

Owning a Lexus, I have been going to this dealership for most of my services. After today's service I now know that they DONT CARE about your car at all and customer service is a joke!   I have been coming here for all of my oil changes, break changes, and etc. Like most dealerships, during oil changes they check your car for inspection or so I thought. Since my last visit I needed a couple services done to my car. When arrived today, my advisor didn't even bother to ask what else I needed to get done or wanted to get done besides an oil change. When finished with the oil change, he didn't bother to tell me if there was anything wrong with the car or if there was anything I needed to know. I personally had to ask myself. He said no and that there was only the things we discussed last visit. NOW this is when I knew they didn't even check my car! Last visit I needed to get my ac filter changed and also my cabin filter changed. Today when arrived those things have already been changed, not at this dealership but elsewhere. So, I know they didn't check! Also, they didn't bother to check if there was anything else that I needed because I recently checked that I needed new tires. They didn't tell me that today at the dealership because they didn't even inspect the car.   Why am I paying Lexus $100 for an oil change when I can go to ANOTHER dealership (like I have before, prior to owning a Lexus) and pay less and have them do all the inspections?! It's ridiculous! I thought I would get BETTER service at my OWN car dealership than to take it to another dealership of another brand but now I know I am better off elsewhere knowing my car will get checked properly!!

Went to outback last night for my birthday and was disappointed. The hostess said it would be a 10-15 minute wait but a lady and her family came after we did and was seated before we were. Our server took atleast 10 minutes before approaching our table and took even longer to bring our bread and waters. The service was ridiculous and also being that it was a slow night. Not too many customers. Many were leaving when we arrived. Wasn't impressed

It's always hard for me to review a fast food joint but KFC had some pretty awesome customer service the other night I went. Besides the 45 minute wait, the inability to order beforehand at the menu stand, and the long lines, our service once we arrived at the window was nothing short of wonderful, something you don't get often at fast food places.   Their mic set wasn't working so we weren't able to order before arriving at the window causing a delay in our food service. Once we finally arrived up to the window, the man behind the counter was very friendly and apologized for the delay in service. There was two of us in the car and he offered us two large sodas for the long wait and even asked if anyone was in the back to offer more drinks for the wait. We ordered a meal for 6 so our food order was pretty large and noticed once we got home a large size of coleslaw was thrown in for us also. That's how customer service should be done!

went to pick up my rental and they gave me a van that reeked of cigarette smoke. they had very limited selection of cars! staff could not keep up with customers. upon returning my rental, the staff member working there was very rude to me after waiting 20 minutes just to drop off the car. he gave me attitude when i asked how much longer it would be and said there was nothing he could do about not helping me. the man proceeded to say he thought i was with another customer so he didnt help me even when he saw me come in by myself and with keys in my hand. rude staff, limited cars, slow customer service! even wrote an email to the manager and the company about the poor customer service and never received a reply back. with the companys culture of customer service goal to have a completely satisfied customer, you guys are sure lacking in that category!! i was very dissatisfied.

Mastro's has always been a favorite steakhouse of mine and has never disappoint. I took my best friend here for her birthday and she was in love.   We both ordered the 24oz porterhouse with lobster tails. For our sides we picked the lobster mashed potatoes and the Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi to share (my absolute favorite! And I think hers now too)   The waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating! It was her first time at Mastro's and they were kind to take the time to go over the menu with her and answer any questions she had. They did a great job surprising her with dessert at the end for her birthday. She still talks about the dinner we had to this day

Will never come to this AMC again! The incompetent workers clearly lacked customer service skills! Also the supervisor on shift! Decided to go to an AMC (i usually go to Harkins, and this review will tell how much everyone should go to Harkins instead!) and their credit card system was down. They said it was cash only. I asked if I can use my fandango confirmation code instead and purchase the tickets through the app fore It doesn't require any credit card, and the guy behind the counter was so frustrated he didn't know what to say besides "our credit card system was down" I proceeded to say there is no credit card required for you because I would purchase them through the app. He said he didn't know if the confirmation would work. I asked him several times to go ask his manager and instead of the manager trying to work things out or see if it would work (I don't see why not) the manager tells the guy; I don't know. What the hell kind of customer service do they provide here?? The lack of customer service skills for both ticket handlers and mangers are sure to drive everyone away! Go to Harkins!

I came here to Fleming's to take my best friend and her parents out for a thank you dinner. I've only heard of Fleming's but had never dined in for dinner. I decided to try this steakhouse out being that it was within close distance to the house.   I made reservations for 4 for 6:30. We were running a few minutes behind so I called and asked to change the reservation to 7:00, the lady said it was okay.   We arrived around 6:40. The hostesse(s) said it would be closer to 7:00 for seating. I don't know how they managed to fill our table within 10 minutes but it was fine. One of the hostess came and told us there was a booth seating available but it was next to the bar. We went to sit and decided it wasn't what we wanted. I asked how long for our normal table and she said it would be at 7:00, again that was fine even though I didn't understand why the long wait.   We were deciding on a bottle of wine to chose from. Our server was anything but helpful. He was more trying to up sell me. That was an instant turn off for me towards the service and restaurant. My best friends mom likes red Zinfandel. I asked what varieties they had. Our server pointed out one red Zinfandel but insisted we wouldn't like it and said he believes we would like these other two different kinds of wine instead and insisted on bringing those two instead. I was very irritated and insisted he bring the one I asked for, also. You can tell he was very hesitant and irritated but he brought it.   I had my best friends mom do the wine tasting. Like I figured, she enjoyed the red Zinfandel instead of the other two selections of different wine that he insisted on.   Upon ordering it seemed as if he hadn't even tried any of the entrees and again was trying to up sell us. My best friends mom asked about one of the small plates, he instantly suggested about getting the steak instead of telling her how the small plate choice she asked about was.   3 of us decided to go with the 6oz filet minion and my best friend decided on the double chicken breast. I ordered all of us the side of lobster and we also had the shareable sides of asparagus, sautéed mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. We also ordered mussels for our appetizers.   Our dinner was delicious and cooked perfectly. I can't complain about the food. We also ordered another bottle of wine and had creme brûlée for dessert.   There were different servers coming out bringing our plates but none of them asked how everything was or if we needed anything. The plates were extremely hot, too hot honestly, that my best friends mom burned her hand and she had to cool it off with the ice water. They didn't even apologize for that. Also, my wine glass had a bug in it. I told our server and he inspected the glass hesitantly and didn't even apologize for that either.   You would think after spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars you would get 5 star service but that wasn't the case here. I guess if you want 5 star service, it's best to go to a 5 star steakhouse which this place was clearly not. If you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars and want good service, go elsewhere! Very disappointed in the service. Mastro's it is next time!

This is my favorite spot to get pho. I've grown up with my mom making authentic home made pho so I know what's good and authentic and what's just eh. And I've had my fair share of over priced noodles and broth that simply wasn't pho at all. This was actually my first spot getting pho and I've tried many other places afterwards but this is definitely my favorite. Their broth is very flavorful. I don't even have to put many seasonings on over it besides my chili sauce.   They are always busy here and they have recently remodeled and added more space. I went last week and seen that they are working on expanding the restaurant even bigger. There was a long line but they always do their best to get you in. There is very little communication with the servers so you pretty much have to know what you want and that's about it. The servers never really come back after they drop off your food and that's if they even drop it off because it's usually always the food runner.   No one ever seems to mind their service unlike most restaurants where you would expect more of a communication with your server. I even heard a couple say they were told to stop by Pho Thanh from a "foodie" from NY and that the guy always knows great food.   This place is definitely good pho!

I've been to Cafe China a couple times now and it's the perfect place to go for a quick lunch. They get you in and out and the service is speedy quick and the food comes out quick. It's never been busy the times I've gone in and the ladies working there are very nice. Their lunch specials are pretty cheap. $1.25 extra for a combo which includes your choice of entrée as well as an egg roll, crab puff, egg fried rice and a bowl of soup (hot and sour or egg flower) I chose the hot and sour and i thought it was delicious-It's the perfect combination of hot and sour.

This Mediterranean spot is one of my new favorites! My best friend recommended this spot and this place surely didn't disappoint! It was very authentic and delicious! They have a special every Monday through Friday which is a plate with a little bit of everything they have to offer such as chicken kabobs, grilled chicken, gyro, and some type of meatballs. Everything was so good! It also comes with a side of pita bread and hummus and also a side salad! This is the perfect place for a lunch combo!

Ordered the west coast chicken burger and it wasn't bad. The truffle fries were delicious, however my friend and I experienced horrible service. The table behind was served before us- even though we arrived before they did. Our food was served by someone else and upon already having our food, our server did not even come up and ask how it was or if we needed anything. Instead she walked past our table 3 times before doing so. My friends water was empty for 10 mins before it was even filled up again. It was not busy and being super bowl week we expected better customer service experience

I'd say this drive in movie theatre is one of the best things about Glendale! On a Tuesday, you can see any movie for only $5 a person. Talk about super cheap! Also, some movies show double screenings which means after the first movie, there is another movie playing right after on the same screen and you're allowed to stay and watch that one as well. Pretty neat for a two for one special! :)   Bring your own lawn chairs and the whole family can sit outside and enjoy a nice movie outside, along with bringing your favorite snacks.

I've visited this downtown bar/restaurant a few times now. I've only been here for the drinks prior until recently my bestfriend and my cousin from out of town came here for dinner. We were seated next door for dinner and they were very understaffed. There was only 1 server on a busy Saturday night with about 5 tables full.   Sara Jane was our server and she did such an excellent job accommodating us and the other guests without showing frustration. A party of 15 arrived after we had already been served our meal and she still checked up on us frequently and made sure we were okay.   My cousins chicken came out a bit raw and she accommodated her meal without hesitation. I ordered the pretzel bread and meaty Mac and cheese and both were very delicious!   Our service was excellent! We went next door for drinks afterwards and had a great time!

They have a pretty good selection for lunch specials. Specials are until 3pm which is very good considering most places end their lunch specials sooner.    There are noodle options and dishes that come with soup, spring roll, and a side of rice.   I had the yellow curry chicken and it was pretty good. Not the best I had, but it was good  My friend had the curry noodles and she said she enjoyed it.

Harrahs is the best casino in the Arizona region by FAR! They have the best rewards program compared to any other casinos. The drive to Harrahs from Phoenix is a distance but well worth it compared to the other casinos. When opening up a FREE players card you are offered a certain amount of dollars in FREE play

I recently moved into the area and this dollar tree became very convenient for me! This is my go to store. I usually tend to avoid dollar stores because it's always so dirty but this is one of the cleanest dollar stores I've been to! The workers are so nice! I've never come across a mean worker here and I've been here about a handful of times since my move.   The best part, everything is a dollar! I've come across many good deals here. Some things I've picked up, I didn't even know they carry but they did and I got it much cheaper than other stores

Seen this place on a billboard ad and saw some friends try this place out so a friend and I decided to check it out and we were impressed! The atmosphere was relaxing and the staff was extra friendly. We tried the number 22 and number 11 breakfast sandwiches and they were both great! We will definitely be coming more often!

If I could give ZERO stars, I would!   MIKE was our server, and he was the shittiest server I've had by far (excuse my language)   Being Valentine's Day, you should expect to please your customers.    Mike was nothing but friendly or helpful. He actually seemed very overwhelmed. We had at the bar and it was not packed. There were openings between each couple, and not to mention another bartender working.    He helped a couple next to us and looked at us up and down a FEW times and walked away without even asking us if we needed help or if he could get us any menus or drinks.   6 minutes past by and I emphasize how long it took for him to come and service us, and ask what we wanted to drink and rudely asks for our ID's  NEVER brought any menus or asked if we needed any. DID NOT come by even once to ask how we were doing or if we needed another drink.    Completely ignored us the entire time! Asked for the bill and left    The worst customer service experience especially on a holiday where you are supposed to feel loved!

Looking for a pinata? Planning a party? This is the place to go!   Pinata heaven is what came to my mind when I first entered the store. There are so many different kinds and varieties to choose from. I went in looking for a pinata for my nieces birthday party. There were cartoon characters to beer bottles to castles of pinatas to choose from. Whatever the occasion is, I'm sure there's something to find here. They also have party favors in bulk. Think Costco but for party supplies. There were light up swords, bubbles, gift bags in bulk. Everything was decently priced. The pinatas were huge and fairly priced. The price I paid for a huge pinata which came with toy balls inside was the same price as those tiny pinatas at the store. You won't be disappointed here!

Decided to check this place out last night on Thursday and it wasn't too busy. It was a pretty small and secluded place, which I enjoyed. You go in and pick a table and sit down and the server comes to greet you. Our server Willie was excellent. He was very knowledgable about what they had to offer and made great suggestions. We went with a meat and cheese platter, duck breast, and mussels. We also went and ordered 2 bottles of the white bubbly wine. It went perfect with our whole meal. They had many options of cheeses to choose from and also they have a whole wall of fridges of beer and wine to select from. You can also purchase any single beers for a six pack like at Total Wine. We had the creme brûlée and sangria cheesecake for dessert and both were delicious! The sangria cheesecake was probably my favorite!

Went to Toby Keith's last night after a year. The first time was for my best friends birthday party and our experience was not the greatest. Drinks were spilt on our friends by the servers, no one was attentive, and it wasn't a good experience in general. Came back last night for the first time in a long time and still wasn't impressed. The food was delicious, however. It wasn't busy at all around 8pm that we were there. Our server failed to check on us when we needed something. Looked for her everywhere when we were ready for our bill while she was just standing up front.

Visited this Burger King store around 845am Tuesday morning. The drive thru line wasn't long surprisingly, being around breakfast rush. We ordered 3 breakfast meal combos that come with hashbrowns and drinks. Unfortunately they forgot our hashbrown sides and we weren't going to turn back around.   The service is fast but you might not get all of your food. I suggest to double check while at the window at this location to risk having to come back for missed items.

One of my favorite parks here in Arizona. The park is pretty clean. I've come here a few times already to fish. Haven't had much luck catching any fishes but I've seen a few people with a decent catch or two. There are catfishes, trout, and bass to name a few. The pond is nice in size and wraps around with good options for steaking out your fishing spot. For kids, there is a big playground and a splash pad also- good for hot days.   On Fridays they have food trucks!

One spontaneous day, my best friend and I walked in to get a pedicure. She highly recommended this salon per prior experience here.   Come to find out, they also offer eyelash extensions AND I was just on the hunt to find a good eyelash extension service/salon.   I'm usually very picky but I said hey, why not give this place a try with them doing my lashes. The salon I had gone to prior was purchased through a Groupon and without it, it's super expensive.    Hannah did my eyelashes and they came out perfect! I get compliments daily! I've been coming here for lashes since day one  Highly recommend service here!

My best friend told me about this place as she had it bookmarked on Yelp. We found a special deal on Groupon for a 2 for 1 special! The special consisted of 8 beer flights. They have it arranged from light to dark. The size was a good amount for tasting and it gets you pretty buzzed. Definitely a good chill spot. Not your normal bar scene but a laid back casual hole in the wall sort of feel.  You are able to bring in your own food. What a plus! And they have pretzels and mustard available for self serve.  The bathroom is clean and the service is friendly. They close at 8 but were willing to stay open for us if we wanted to order around round.   Highly recommend!

I've been apartment searching for a few days and on my last day I decided to check this place out. Paseo Park was going to be my last stop for the day also and I was very grumpy and apartment looking out.   Daisy gave us some information about the apartment and gave us a tour of some of the models. What I LOVED was that she showed us many floor plans and we were able to compare them to the last. We went from the biggest to the smallest. She asked if we would feel comfortable in the space. I loved that because MANY of the other apartments only show you one floor plan or two at the most and they give very little information and rush you out. Daisy on the other hand gave ample amounts of information just so she didn't miss anything. I loved that more. Also her personality was so friendly that I think that's what won me over on the apartment.   They are still in progress of renovating and all the bottom floor plans have hard wood floors. Two gyms are available and a clubhouse with wifi and a movie room.   Most of the residents I've seen are teenagers. Daisy said they keep a percentage of the apartments available for students at a certain income rate, which is nice. Asu west is nearby and Gcc isn't that far away.   I would highly suggest giving this apartment a look at and would consider talking to Daisy!

Chick fil a always has great service no matter the location. This locations customer service was just as great as expected. I was greeted upon entry and the workers even brung me my food. I ordered the chicken soup and I was about to go get a spoon when one of the workers was already on her way to bring me one. What great customer service.   Once I finished my food my tray was full of trash and another worker came and asked if she could clean my tray for me. Another excellent customer service!   The food is always great for being fast food. It is on the pricer side for fast food but I don't mind paying for the great service!   Their chick fil a sauce is to die for!

Delicious pizzas! They come as a personal pizza and I thought it was a good enough size/portion for me. I went with the chicken pesto pizza and I would definitely get it again. My friend had ordered the Hawaiian pizza. You can pick already made pizzas or make your own

I've been craving street tacos for a long time now since my usual taco truck has now relocated and my friend suggested this place. I came in with high hopes. They sell fries, hot dogs, tacos, and even corn in the cup (elotes)   The tacos come in an order of 4 for $6.50. A little pricer than my usual spot. Their tacos also came with a jalapeño and some onions on the side. The tacos itself were not bad but I thought it lacked some flavor. I even used some guacamole sauce and hot sauce but it did no justice. Not what I was hoping for with the tacos but not bad either.   May be back to try the hot dogs

Decided to sit down and have lunch and a drink at The Thirsty Lion before shopping at Fashion Square- the service was nothing more disappointing on a Saturday afternoon at 4pm, barely dinner time. Upon arrival the hostess said he would be back with some waters. 5 minutes past and a lady comes to our table and tells us, "I'm not your server but I will take your order because your server is currently backed up", keep in mind, still no waters. We tell her our orders having ordered 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, and an entree. A man (manager) comes up to our table 10 minutes later and delivers the appetizers and drinks. We asked for a side of plates and another set of silverware since there was only 1 on the table and he says he will be back with them. My friend gets upset and goes inside to find someone who can get us some plates and silverware being we are starving and having no plates to eat with, also 10 minutes had passed! Our server asks if we want the entree cut in half and my friend says no. 1 second later the man behind him brings the entree. (What is the point in asking when the food is already here????) no one comes to check on us after the food arrives. The fries that came with the entree were the leftover pieces that you can tell were old. The food was cold.

I recently signed up at this gym due to Youfit's screw up.   I signed up for the black card for $20/month. With the black card however you are required a contract for a year but only a $1 enrollment fee.   I've been here a few times and love it more than I thought I would even like it. The staff members are always friendly. The gym is busy during peak hours in late afternoons like most gyms but aren't too packed.   Their hydro beds and hydro chairs are my favorite after my workouts. It massages your body parts to your choosing and is like foam rolling my body out without the work!   The locker room is always clean and showers are available   I can highly suggest trying this place out

It was my friends birthday and we wanted to go somewhere nice for dinner. Decided to check out HEXX. The atmosphere and setting was nice. Hostess sat us down and we looked over our menus. I wasn't too impressed with their selections. They had very little to offer and the prices were high for what they offered. My friend ordered the classic burger that came with fries. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara with a side of shrimps. The burger was overly expensive for a plain cheeseburger. (You can go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR and get a burger for much cheaper) the spaghetti was not what I expected and wasn't that great. Service could've been better. Our server barely came around to check on us or asked if we needed anything. Wasn't busy for a Saturday night either. Won't be going back

I've visited this restaurant a few times before during their first opening and haven't gone back for a while.   I visited again last night for a craving of pho and I was not disappointed.   Our server made sure to tell us that the food and boba we ordered might take a little longer than usual because he is the only one working tonight.   We didn't mind and appreciated him telling us. My friend and I ordered a boba drink, chicken wings for appetizers and a bowl of pho each.   Their chicken wings were amazing! So full of flavor! Something I did not expect to taste when I took my first bite! Also for having boba, this restaurant is at the top of my list!   The pho was also good. I wouldn't mind coming in again for more!

So, the new iPhone 6s came out today. Of course I wanted it BUT I didn't need it. I NEEDed to get my iPhone 6 screen fixed! I went on Yelp and searched for phone repairs. Called a few stores and they were highly priced. $140 here and $120 there! I would've went to Apple itself BUT the wait is ridiculous! Not to mention it wouldn't have happened today (new phone release)   Anyway, I'm beyond glad I decided to go with mobile device docs! Super convenient! They come to you and you don't need to wait! Isaiah was really nice and very knowledgable! He took the time to explain everything to me and made sure every part of the phone worked by testing it out for dead pixels and the proximity also. Will definitely choose mobile device docs again and definitely recommend!!

This taco truck deserves 5 stars all around! The food alone is so delicious! $1.50 each for carne asada tacos. They are pretty small but they are so worth it. They also serve other things as well but the tacos are my go to! They have an enclosed tent with a tv for dining in.   You won't be disappointed with tacos here! Yum!

It was my first time trying this place last night and I loved it. Everything from the environment to the fresh juices/food was great. It can get pricey but it's a great place to eat when you're looking to eat healthy! I'm looking forward to trying out their breakfast selections next

I'm not a pizza person by any means! I'm the type that can only eat pizza once a month and never crave it, ever. I'm more of a pasta person but Chicagos deep dish pizza came to Arizona, and being from Chicago my friend and I decided to come try this place out. I grew up in Chicago but never tried this pizza joint because pizza wasn't my thing.   My overdue Chicago deep dish pizza experience: it was amazing! We ordered some bruschetta for appetizer and a 2 person 'The Lou' pizza. It comes with spinach, mushrooms, and a ton of cheese and tomatoes and extra deliciousness!   I was honestly surprised I enjoyed every bite of that pizza and I believe I over indulged as I needed to unbutton my pants afterwards. It's not your ordinary pizza and it will blow away those of you that don't normally go for pizza either.   The service here is 5 star worthy! Our server was very friendly and explained that he is from Chicago and moved here 6 years ago. Once he heard Lou Malnatis was opening up, he quit his job and decided to work here.   I accidentally spilled my beer as soon as I got it and EVERY worker was rushing to our table to help and ask if we were okay and asked if they could get me a refill. I can't say enough how they all worked together to get everything tidied up! One guy came to mop, another came to clean and dry the table, someone brung new plates and utensils, and two ladies at different times came and asked if they could bring me another beer. Excellent service!   I'm curious to try their pasta next! Way to represent!

This is a new location that just opened. The bathrooms weren't flushing and smelled. Our burger order didn't come with garnishments such as lettuce or tomatoes. Our server had his elbow on our table slouching down and leaning on our table while asking for our order, not professional.  The kids enjoyed playing the games. However the service here sucks. Very surprising being that it's located in Westgate- the heart of all entertainment!
