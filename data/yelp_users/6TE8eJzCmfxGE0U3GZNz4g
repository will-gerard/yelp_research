I used to love this place, but something is obviously different now. Frozen seafood, small portions, so-so service and staff not knowing the menu. In a town starving for a good Italian restaurant, this one is just not worth it.

Good place -- always familiar faces. Gets a little hectic for Football and UFC events, but otherwise is always a good time. The bartenders are cool people and always quick with joke. Good prices, strong drinks, great staff.

It's takes a certain type to hang out at the PV. If the bathrooms at the PV could talk, it would be a hell of a story -- I've seen it all there. I met my ex-wife at the PV, it didn't last long (it's that kind of a spot.)

Just go! This place has the best local brews and a great menu. It's a fun place to go and hang out and in a short 15 years, it's become an AZ staple.

I have a real Love Hate relationship with this venue. It's close to my house and it does pull a lot of great national acts. As previously reviewed the sightlines are good and the sound is OK at best.   I shoot photos at this venue often and the stage lighting is decent but it seems like they've changed something recently and the tones are more on the red side - which is a photographer's nightmare.  The security team is never on the same page with venue and artist policy and protocol. There is always conflicting information between the team members which inevitably ends up with in a run in with them for me.  I am not a fan of Luckyman Porductions and I think it's time for someone else to take over our area and expose these guys for being the greasy businessmen they are. Surcharges, upcharges, taxes, parking fees for a lot I'm not sure they own or have the rights to just to name a few.  Basically, I go there because I have to but given my choice I would prefer The Celebrity Theater or The Orpheum Theater in Phoenix any day.

A Tempe staple for great live music. Two stages, both indoor and outdoor make this a great place for events with multiple bands. Nice staff, stiff drinks and a lot of cool people.

If you're a vegetarian, you already know about this place. If you're looking to take a vegetarian somewhere -- this place is a sure spot. Best veggie/vegan cuisine I've ever had.

A lot has changed and this place is less of a sports bar and more of a biker bar. Food is still bad, service sucks and is'nt worth a visit.

This place went from being a decent sports bar to a place where bikers hang out. The management has adapted to the new crowd and changed their bar slogan to "Represent Mother F****"   Not a great place, feels more like a private club you're waking into that you weren't invited to.   Shame for what used to be a nice neighborhood spot.

Chill spot for drinking with the boys. Not a place to bring your best girl to, but if you're looking to grab a few while watching a game, this is the place for you. Food is surprisingly good, since the bartenders work the grill behind the bar.

One of my favorite breakfast/Blood Mary spots in town. Cool atmosphere of classic rock records on the fall, with a great staff of people. Family-owned business.

Dr. Steve has done wonders for my overall health. I've been a patient for over three years and I'm virtually pain free. My neck, back and ankles are all in way better condition than previously which allows me to be very active and play competitive sports. If you're looking for a chiropractor in Arizona, Dr. Steve is your guy.

I ordered tale out from EAT24.com.  After waiting for 90 minutes for my food, I called and spoke to the restaurant who informed me that the driver would be at my house in 10-15 mins. Another 20 minutes pass, and I chat with the EAT 24 team, who also are told that they are 10 mins away.   I wait another 20 minutes, now I've been waiting 2+ hours (for Chinese food mind you) and I call again. I speak to a manager at Jade House, who tells me they never received my order. Huh? What happened to the two times I was promised it was on its way?  The EAT24 rep said the order was confirmed and now they were also telling them that the order was never received. Someone is lying here.  Needless to say, after waiting 2 1/2 hours, EAT24 refunded my money and I went to Whole Foods and got dinner.  Order from Jade House at your own risk.

I like Dave's Electric. Great location for a micro-brewery (on the corner of 5th and College in downtown Tempe.) I enjoyed the Electric Brew with a veggie burger and had a great time with friends on the patio.   Dave's is vegetarian friendly and dogs are welcome on the patio on a leash.   Good beer, good food, good locale, good vibe.

The Modern Wedding Scenes team handled my photo shoot on location in Cholla Bay, Mexico. Chadwick and his staff, helped put us at ease in front of the camera and took the time to listen to what we really wanted to commemorate the moment, plus added suggestions that were invaluable.  The result is a set of photographs we will remember forever that truly captured the moment. If you are need a wedding photographer or a photographer to capture an important moment in time, Chadwick Fowler and Modern Wedding Scenes are your guys.

The worst restaurant in Tempe hands down. I've been there several times and received the same poor service with the same sloppy food.   Really it's a shame since it's a great location, but I can't wait to see what takes this place's spot.  http://grtaylor2.com/2011/09/16/worst-restaurant-in-tempe-deverti-bar-gril/

One of our favorite spots. The Pig & Pickle is always a great dinning experience. While the menu is always evolving, the staple dishes are always awesome.   The P&P is a great spot for a client dinner, a night out with family and friends, or simply for a quick bite.   Don't skip the Pork shoulder tostadas or the Apocalypse Sow burger. Enjoy!
