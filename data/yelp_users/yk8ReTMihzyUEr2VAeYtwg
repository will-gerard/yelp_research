Had a wonderful time with my girlfriend! Staff was very friendly especially the cook Kyle. We had a great time talking with him and watching him cook as we ate. Food was amazing and beer selection was awesome! 10/10 we will be back

Horrible service.... No attentiveness... Mediocre/cold food...  Did not feel welcome.

Young blonde blonde at the front was very rude. Called on the phone and spoke to 3 different people and was told they didn't carry what I needed. Got to the store and asked a nice blonde WOMAN and she kindly directed us to what we needed. First girl killed it for us... Won't be back unless I absolutely have to and in which case I may just bite the bullet.

Had by far the best experience I have had at a restaurant! Food was amazing and service was top notch. Great atmosphere! Natasha helped us out with all the little sea critters we didn't know how to eat and also gave us great suggestions. Hands down will return hungry and ready for more.

Ok... This one is tough... Immediately walked in and felt the stuffy atmosphere. Sat  down looking forward to the good food I have been hearing about and placed my order. Service had been pretty solid at this point. Ended up waiting 35 minutes for our food and when it came mine didn't.... Following this disappointment I politely asked the server if he could turn the air down a little bit as the entire restaurant was fanning themselves and he responded with the air conditioner had been broke for hours... In Arizona.....its 102 out mind you. I feel like that should have been brought up when we walked in and sat down rather than as we were wiping sweat off of our heads. As we keep going down this journey I finally get my food which was quite a delightful burger. We QUICKLY  asked for our checks and were kept waiting as the bar tender chatted it up with another group as we were left sweating. I'm not a cheap ass by any means and still left a 20% tip however I was hoping for some sort of a discount.... Must have caught orange table on a bad day but I don't think I'll try again.
