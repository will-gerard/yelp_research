Not worth the price. They will not let you break contract. You either have to move far away, break a bone or sustain permanent injury, or buy out your contract at 1/2 the price, which considering that it is like $1500 a year is still A LOT of money. I'm stuck paying for something that I don't have the money to do anymore... Only do this if you're seriously dedicated.

I ordered a Deadpool birthday cake from them at the end of last month. We picked it up on the 4th of July and I hid it from my boyfriend (it was for his b-day!) for over 24 hours. The cake was cute! I got it french toast flavored, and it was incredibly moist and absolutely delicious. Even his family (who are not vegan) enjoyed it. It is a week later, and we're still eating it and it's still yummy!!! Thank you for making me the perfect vegan cake. It was a huge hit with my boyfriend. Definitely worth every cent!

I'm a huge fan of Mellow Mushroom because of their vegan pizza option. You have to pay $3 extra for vegan cheese, but it's understandable since Daiya is expensive. I have brought tons of friends here and they've all loved it. Yesterday, my boyfriend and I came for his first vegan pizza. He's a picky eater, but after picking off all the veggies, he seemed to enjoy it. The service is always outstanding and even when they're packed the timing is great.  Not to mention their huge list of 48 beers on tap!! They even have Papago (which I love!)  If only they were a bit cheaper (or didn't charge extra for vegan cheese!)

I've only come here late at night (past midnight). They've always been nice, the bouncers are super friendly! They're even kind enough to get their fire pit going every time I ask for it!  They also serve the white chocolate ale (which I'm a fan of!)  As for the music, it's a hit and miss. Sometimes you get some good jams, and there are times when it's been some weird instrumental techno. I prefer when they play more 90s music.. it keeps it different from the other bars on mill. And I love the atmosphere!

The pancakes were amazing! Aside from that, we didn't particularly care for the eggplant bacon or the nachos... the cheeze still had bits of carrots in it. The staff was nice and so was their selection of deserts.  I would say it's a "meh". Would be willing to go again but definitely wouldn't be my first choice. However, as it is 100% vegan.. it gets 4 stars for going the extra mile and not just staying vegetarian. So, thank you for that!!

I used to work at the diner next door, so I've been to this bar a few times. Here are my thoughts:   It's really small compared to a lot of bars around. I'm not a fan of the pretentious atmosphere. It's part of the hotel, if that says anything.   The music is nothing great. You can find better at lounges near by. Mill is literally down the street with much better options, even for food!!  And last but not least, the management sucks. The manager of Tapacubo (Tolan Farris) is one of the worst most arrogant people I've met. I mostly say this due to the fact that I've heard him say some awful things about customers for no reason. He's unprofessional and inappropriate.   Honestly, don't spend your money there, especially with the current management. There are so many better options in the area! Explore and find businesses that will treat you with respect and not bad mouth you behind your back.

Sitting in here now and can I just say it's absolutely amazing!!! We started out with Samosa and Vegetable Cutlet. Both wonderful! Now we had some Indian bread with peas, house specialties and some of their crepes. All fantastic!! Service is great. Everyone is friendly and refills are on time. Everything is naked for vegans and gluten free folks. Thank you for existing and making my dinners so enjoyable!! :D LOVE IT
