I hate to give this a bad review because i honestly was hoping to love this place. I was expecting to give it 5 stars along with the rest of the reviews.. But of course that wasnt the case. Its cute and small but great for spending time with friends. I love the fact that its open till 2am. The only issue i had is their food is not that good i felt. To start before i even got to order and was looking at the menu i had a friend with me that had takeout from another place. We were approached by a young lady named Christina who told him he couldnt bring in the food because of the liquor license and that he needed to "get out". I could understand a beverage from somewhere else but a liquor license has nothing to do with food. The thing was she had a bit of an attitude which really turned me off to not even order anymore, but i still did regardless because i wanted to try this place.  I ordered the poutine fries which i was really hoping to be good seeing all the pictures and reviews for it. Like everyone said the wait time for your food is truly ridiculous. I ordered my food take out only to watch others that came after me be served their take out.. All in all it took 56 minutes for french fries and a side of gravy.  For $9 french fries i expected them to be good.. maybe i came too late or on an off day for the cooks but i feel i could have honestly ate better fries at a McDonalds.. A young guy i believe to be the manager came out and apologized for the misunderstanding of Christina shooing us out. He let us know that she was confused on the liquor license that it was only for outside beverages not food. Props to him for being kind enough to do that. But on the other hand the employees should ask questions if they are unsure on something before jumping on someone. Its common respect for the employees and customers.  Would i be back? Unlikely.

I really wish i could give this a better review but they closed 20 minutes before they were supposesd to and on top of it everyone was extremely rude. Never again, save your money and go get yogurt or something wouldnt be surprised if they went out of business and became replaced with a yogurt shop.

Let me just comment on walking in. I was not greeted or even acknowledged and i stood at the front for 20min wondering if we seat ourselves or not. You would think there was a sign, nope. The bartender finally asked me what i needed and thats when i found out we seat ourselves. I grabbed a menu and silverwear and tried to pick out of all the empty tables the 2 that were clean.  You mean to tell me you have 3 customers and all your tables have not been clean off except for 2? Hmm. Its EXTREMELY dim inside, only light is from the window and a few in the ceiling, i can only imagine at night.  The onion rings were pretty decent, nothing special just a normal onion ring. Tender onions for sure, but the ratio between onion and bread sucks. Your mostly just eating bread, i couldnt even taste the onion or see it to be honest on some.  French fries. Terrible! I could not believe how gross and lifeless these were. French fries are not hard to do, really.. these were not even cripsy, just soggy and cold.. funny thing is the waitress set them down warning me they were "hot". These were not even luke warm. My onion rings were hotter than the fries and they came out before the fries? To be honest the fries tasted like they were microwaved, and that is such a big turn off.  CJ's cheesesteak, the big boy here. The cheesesteak i was surprised at how good it was. The bread was soft and fresh. Meat was seasoned great and it had a nice flavor. I would get it again if i ever came back.  I just wanna add in the ranch that they provide isnt the best and tasted REALLY watered down. I was upset because again, ranch is not a hard thing to do right.  SERVICE. This is a big miss. The waitress was friendly but never checked on me and also failed to provide refills.. again the place only had 3 customers in the whole bar including seating area..   All in all, i will not be back. I didnt even finish my food hardly expect for the sandwhich and left to finish eating something at home. I was not impressed with this place. $12 for a cheesesteak is way to high for the quality. Maybe they are great for beer, or game day, but on a regular day this is not a place i would come to eat at.

Oh my gosh. Best donuts!!!! I tried Bosa donuts and those were terrible. Krispy Kreme has been my main donut. But forget Krispy! Rainbow donuts is my new main donut place. So many flavors. SO CHEAP. The guy even gave me extra donuts for free. UH YES?!?!   I will be back. To bad they close so early.

This place is NOT military friendly. The new people they put in Veterans services in April 2015 suck they have no idea what they are doing and half the time they sit around and stare at you instead of help you. I have to go to the dean of the school just to help me get everything straight and still cant get it straight because he doesnt even know what to do, for gods sake we had to call VA and spend 3 hours on the phone on how to certifiy classes!! Are you for real?!? Bring back the people that knew what they were doing, please!!! If you are a Veteran i highly advise you to seek another school or dont use your benefits here.. they have been dinged 4 times by the VA for not certifying classes correctly and messing up Veteran benefits!!! If you want to go through HELL to get your classes certified then GateWay is the place for you! If you dont, seek another school.

Awesome place seriously! I got my nails done here and they are always so nice and it feels like they arent out to just take your money and tack on extra cash because they think they can sneak it by you like most places, $15 for gel nails making it $20 including tip, i didnt have any trouble paying that! They take care of my nails and have never had a problem. Great price awesome employees and you feel comfortable. I found my nail place!

So i really thought this place would turn into my favorite nail place. Wrong!!! They closed an early, i tried to make an appointment but all they seemed to say was "we be on lunch at that time", your gonna be on lunch every hour of the day? Forget it! Go somewhere else!

If i could give this place zero stars i would. I called ahead of time for an appointment. Walked in 15 minutes early, lady told me she couldnt do my nails because it was only her and she didnt have time?  So i take off work and come by and now they cant do my nails because she doesnt have time? They close at 7 and i came at 3? There was nobody in there? They dont want the money, someone else will i guess right? Oh well lol

So we came here based off the reviews. Im a big wing lover, so any place that has great wings better believe ill be there! -The wings were pretty good. Crispy but not dry, reminds me a lot of long wongs wings but a little better. 4/5  -Steak Fries were pretty good, you get a lot. 4/5 - Fish and chips was terrible, overcooked and dry. 1/5 -Waitress was very much on top of everything 5/5 The place is full of bar people, so if you like that then this is a great place for you. Pool table, loud music and mellow people.  This will be my wing place when ATL Wings is closed, seeing that Stackers is open till 2am. Great place for late night munchies.

Alright. This place has been sad the past few times i went. But this last time took the cake for me! There wasnt much people in the bar pretty mellow. Until one of the workers came out wasted and couldnt hold himself up! Our waitress Sarah kept serving him drinks when everyone at the bar was wanting her to stop so they could get this guy outta there.  He started a few fights at the pool table nearly tripping over himself on our table. Sarah our waitress just laughed and treaded on.. The food was terrible this time as the usual cook wasnt there.. Sarah "forgot" a lot of the things we ordered. Like a side of fries, bacon on a burger and ranch. We asked her many times only to her defense saying she never heard us say we wanted that, YET she wrote it on our ticket? huh? Then claimed the cook wasnt doing his job right and forgot our stuff not her. Haha... alright. If your going to lie make sure you do it right. It wasnt till we were done that we got our ranch, fries and bacon. What good is it now?  Oh and let me just add, i found a piece of hair wrapped around my wings. Nothing was done except for Sarah saying its not hers and walking away. DISGUSTING. Never again!

This guy is awesome! Please if you have anything that he can service bring it here you will thank me! We had a great conversation and a few laughs. His work is great and he does it for so little. This guy deserves the most.  Dennis if your reading this, thank you so much for my watch and the good conversation. And remember dont give up on your little girl she will come around!

For paying $29.99 a month you should be able to bring a guest and play ball for free not have to pay for every fucking thing on top of a $30 membership.  Usually i go to the LA Fitness by arrowhead and they are super nice and clean.  Aside from be super dirty and expensive the staff is rude. They just sit around and fiddle with their tumbs.  Im was so embarrassed to even bring a guest there. Next time ill bring my guest to the one near arrowhead this one was embarrassing.. dont come here seriously.

This is a terrible college. Ive taken MANY classes here. As everyone says professors lack communication and you have to try to guess what the professor wants. This will be the LAST class i ever try to take from them. I took a HUM class here and was cited for supposed plagarism yet they couldnt tell me what i plagarised? Maybe because i didnt. I talked to the head chair of the HUM classes and asked why i couldnt get simple questions answered from my teacher and she replied with "ive been documented for threating her by contacting the head chair and not my teacher". What the fuck? The only reason i contacted the head chair of the HUM was to see what the reason was for me not getting my questions answered over the course of 12 weeks?! How is that threatening? The chair was even distant on answering my questions of how i plagarised. Nobody wanted to answer me on that.  The reviews dont lie on here. There are plenty of other colleges to take online classes from that arent as distant and unprofessional as this one.  Oh and so those you of you be on the look out for the teacher im talking about if you have to take a class- Allison Gee Id highly advise you to look for another teacher i wish i would have listened to the students who told me to not take her. Oh and while im at it let me call out the Head Chair of the HUM department as well for being so unprofessional and unhelpfull just pushing me away because the teachers in her department are "never wrong" . -Janine adkins

So i came here because a long time ago when i was little my mom brought me here. I took the tour when i was 6 and it was MUCH longer than 30 minutes? Hmm. Also i remember them having chocolate covered strawberries that where the biggest things ive ever seen! They were good. I came in hoping to find one but found a chocolate covered banana instead. Place inside was a little messy and old. But nothing new from what i remember!  I must have liked the chocolate covered banana cause it was all over my face by the time i finished it.

I really enjoyed this place for the second time. I recommend the Thai sweet and spicy wings. Has a great flavor and crispy but not dry. I always get my wings extra crispy just to take the slime away from the skin. They grill and fry the wings, which is so weird but awesome. The posole was amazing and you got so much it was well worth it. I highly highly highly recommend the posole. Filled with chucks of meat and great savory flavor in the broth. I will def be here on rainy days for that posole or any day i feel i NEED it which is EVERYDAY. The place is casual and nice for a dinner or lunch. The bartendars are awesome, as far as the service for the regular servers.. not so fond of their service. They are extremely slow and not very friendly. This place has become a new favorite and i cant WAIT to try the Mac n cheese!

So i came in because i heard about them on cupcake wars so i had to try them. The place is small and parking is way in the back and hard to get in and out of. One way in and one way out. Its cute inside and has a couple of tables outside.  I was extremely sad that i didnt like any of the flavors.. except for the double chocolate... I ordered the  -Mexican chocolate- If you like chocolate and spice you will like this. Not BAD but not great either. 3/5 -Orange blossom- I did not see what all the hype was with this? Tasted bland..1/5 -Double chocolate- very rich and moist, favorite out of the bunch. 4/5 -Peanut butter chocolate- i was REALLY hoping to like this.. sadly i was mistaken. 3/5 -Lemon- just tasted like a regular vanilla cake with lemon icing? 3/5 -German chocolate- the worst out of the bunch. For starters i found plastic in the middle of my cupcake.. and to top it off it left a very bland taste in my mouth.. 1/5 -Banana- This one was not bad but nothing im going to remember.. 3/5  To be honest these cupcakes tasted old and no flavor really. If there was any flavor it was extremely weak.. I dont see what all the hype is and with the cupcakes i had it was hard for me to figure out how they won cupcake wars? Maybe i came on a bad day, but i tried a pretty good amount of flavors that seemed to all lack things.. it seemed as though it was mainly the icing that was supposed to taste different because the cake was just either chocolate or vanilla nothing special. Sadly i dont think ill be back..

So this used to be a really good dog park, but lately for the past month theres a nasty older colored lady with a white small dog that goes to the small dog side and acts like she runs the place with her group of older people. Shes constantly picking on dog owners and their dog, and even told a couple they werent aloud  in the dog park because their dog was a medium sized dog and it was only for small or large dogs not "medium" sized. I hate to just pick on her but it got to the point where she was kicking dogs and even tried to kick my dog for sniffing her dogs ass. Like really..? If your going to yell and scream and kick things do it at home. If you dont want other dogs to sniff your dogs ass leave it at home too! Common sense.

So i went in here to have my lense made. They attempted to fit a smaller lense into a large frame, and surprise surprise it didnt work.. Diane the "General manager" i wouldnt even call her that, she didnt even know about the products she was selling and the service she gave was nice at first and then terrible terrible TERRIBLE as we went on. As a manager or im sorry even more a GENERAL MANAGER, how do you not know about the products your selling?  Anyways, back to the real issue. They gave me a standard lense instead of the higher grade lense i paid for. She also wouldnt even give me my money back for the lenses that i paid for and never got because they scamed me. They told me the higher grade lense film would wear off in a year. WELL WHATS TO POINT OF BUYING IT THEN?! The reason it "wore off" seemed to be the reason a lot of people are getting. You cleaned it wrong or too much. I call BS. Their bullshit excuses are getting a little overused.  Jessie the lab manager likes to argue and cant admit a mistake. Diane the GM is a bullshit manager as well.  SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO THE 1 STAR REVIEWS THEY ARENT LYING I WISH I WOULD HAVE TRUSTED YELP A LITTLE MORE.

Im a bit torn. I really wanted to LOVE this place.. maybe i came on an off day, im not sure.. To start, i waited at the front for 30min. Everyone just stared and nobody helped me. Soon after i asked one of the cooks if we seat ourselves he said no a host will be with you. About 15min later a girl comes up. She tells me its a 45 minute wait.. 45 minutes and the place is empty!  A few minutes later she seats me. So much for 45minutes lol. The food is alright, its a different taste. Unique flavors but i feel they lack in depth..  I started off with the fingerling potatos which i wasnt expecting but pretty good. They are great to share but everyone said they were crispy? I was a little confused on this? Mine were not crispy in fact i could have made mashed potatos with them. Still good tasting either way. I ordered the pig dip next seems how it was highly recommed on yelp. The reviews made it sound so good.. but i was really disappointed. The mustard over powered the sandwhich and the au jus lacked a lot of flavor. I even added salt and pepper to kind of help it but still didnt do it justice.. I had one little strip of bacon that i wouldnt even know i had if i wasnt looking for it. The bread was good. I ordered the salad instead of french fries because i had already ordered the fingerling potatos. The salad was a terrible mistake. It tasted like acid basically. Was not happy.. The service was good, the waiter made sure my water was filled and didnt run low. He packaged my stuff for me, and brought me fresh au jus. Props to Daniel for the good service. I dont know if id be back though. The table next to me which was about 5 inches away seemed to love this place..  Honestly i was really confused as to why..? Also if your like me and you dont like valet service or perfer not to use it your forced into it. The guy told me i HAD to do valet service or i couldnt eat here. Ive had bad experience with valet service and i can park my own car. Forcing someone to do valet service is a bit much.. I really wanted to love this place but i think ill pass.

Came in for the burgers. First timer. Burger was just alright could get a better burger at BK. You cant do substitutions,  they just charge you extra. Bacon was over cooked as well as the burger itself. Manager didnt bother to come by just walked around looking at us. Wont be back thats for sure.

This place is great i love coming here and getting the beef eater ! Best sandwhich i think. Food is pretty pricey for what you get, not to impressed with the price. Staff is pretty friendly except some of the girls talk in a real high pitch i cant understand them but good service. I wouldnt recommed this for take out unless your willing to have something wrong on your order or are willing to wait an hour for a sandwhich and have others be served before you, that came after you. But great food!

Ive passed by this place many times on my way to work only to discard it as another one of those breakfast places. Ugh was i wrong! This place has amazing food and its so close to my house which is not really a good thing..    I had to get the french toast of course. They make it so different but its amazing. To me it lives up to what french toast is supposed to be. Sweet, cinnamon, vanilla goodness! Although a little too sweet for me. 4/5  The scamble browns i completely fell in love with.. these are pure heaven to me. Creamy, rich, bacon, cheese, and egg all mashed together with potatos...  1000/5   I felt so sad when i dropped part of my scramble browns on the floor. Im so tempted to get another side order to eat and another to take home.  Not to mention if your a Cholula hot sauce lover like me they have a great selection!! You wont be disappointed..! I for sure will be back!

I hate to give them 1 star because i came here based off the reviews.. I went here because it was close. Long story short i have pretty long natural nails. I couldnt get to my usual nail place that takea care of them so i went here.  Walked in and they were friendly, nice and sat me down quickly.  The lady clearly didnt understand much english. I told her i wanted to keep the length but just to file them down a little bit to maintain the crisp clean form i had going on. She filed them. As she was cutting off the dead skin around the nail she also cut my nail!!! I refused and asked to leave because i told her i didnt want my nails cut short!  She told me she would match the rest of them to look nice. And wasnt very gental with the hands and cutting. So i trusted and proceeded on. Next thing i know all my nails are short stubbs. All that time i took and care to grow them out nice and strong just to have a lady cut them off!  On top of it the price was ridiculous. All i got was a gel color and thats it. $30 not even including a tip!!! But the girl next to me had her feet, eyebrows, and nails done for $35!! I asked if they had a special going on they said no.  Not happy with my nails and will not return! Wouldnt even give them 1 star. Never again.

Nasty place. Smells like cigs, dirty silverware, didnt restock anything since we have been there, waiters dont speak english or understand what you tell them. People are rude to old timers, no respect what so ever. You pay a high price for this? Ha! Ill go somewhere forget this place. You cant give good customer service and stuff, i cant give a good review! Terrible save your money, wouldnt be surprised if they go outta business!

This place is pretty good. Food is awesome and tasty. I got the Banana cream french toast with bacon and potatos. My friend had the Country Benny. The potatos were amazing!  Bacon i could taste the smoked applewood in it. French toast was good. I like the vibe of the place and the GF stuff they have! You probley wait longer to get in than you do to get your food. It was like i ordered and blinked and my food was done. Pretty awesome. The reason for my 2 stars is the young lady at the front was too busy talking to the shorter girl about her black long nails. That i stood at the front, right in front of her for awhile saying excuse me just so she could take my name down. After awhile she stopped and said, oh im sorry i just got my nails done i had to show her.  Alright... I asked her how long the wait was and she gave me an attitude saying she didnt know because she had to go look for someone, to ask when she comes back. Then,  just turned back around and kept talking about her nails. My waitress failed to bring me a refill after asking 4 times and still never got one, but she managed to bring the check. Thank god for the water on the table! So, this place is really good and deserves all the credit for their food. But my service today sucked. For a first timer, i may not be back only because of the service.

This place was pretty good. I was impressed on how rich, creamy and soft the ice cream was. I usually go for sorbet flavors but the Butter Pecan here just had my heart. EVERY bite i had a piece of yummy roasted pecan! Not bad.  Strawberry Sorbet wasnt that great but wasnt terrible either. Its better than Cold Stone thats for sure. For the same price ill just stick to this place.

So we came here because the reviews were good. DO NOT let this place fool you. At first i thought, this place isnt going to be that good. OH MY GOSH, BEST GREEK PLACE EVER. I left more than full.   3 meat combo - juicy, flavorfull and amazing. 5/5  Gyro plate - Flavorfull, sauce was ohk,  but would get it again! 4/5   Bakalava- AWESOME AND RICH. 5/5  Potato soup- Rich flavor and awesome just as everyone says. 5/5  Lentil- Soup didnt have as much flavor as the potato soup but still good and a bit zesty. 4/5  We will be back, hole in the wall gem. Cant wait to come back!

This place was pretty good. My burger was pretty small than what im used to..it was good but small.. i watched customers order burger after burger and i was wondering why they kept going back up to the register? Why didnt they just order everything at one time? As i watched more, they would eat their burger and if they wanted another one they would go back up and order just the burger. Which makes sense after seeing how big they were. I wasnt even full myself after eating the whole burger and fries. The place is located in like a strip mall area so its really small inside. The employees in there are extremely nice and pretty friendly and outgoing. Forsure they have the bragging rights of being on triple D!  I got the french toast fries which tasted pretty interesting. They are def worth a try if your coming here, the only thing is they are a little greasy.. but so good!

So i got banana foster french toast and i was really looking forward to loving it seems how everyone said it was good here on yelp. I dont know what french toast they had but mine was disgusting. The sauce was so slimey it didnt even stick to my french toast or soak in it just layed on top of it.. i LOVE Bananas foster and this was NOT bananas foster..  Not to be graphic here but the sauce was almost like snot. Slimey and wouldnt pull away from the fork. I had to cut it. Let me repeat. I had to CUT sauce..   I took it up with an employee who just seemed to not care and acted like i didnt know what i was saying. I then took it to the front and asked for something else. The manager i believe exchanged my meal for something else. I ended up with the breakfast burrito and it was amazing. The potatos were also amazing. Would i be back? Its very unlikely.

Awesome place. I went it in for the first time yesterday and i will be back. Wasnt too expensive but i dont mind paying if my nails are well done and they take their time. The girl i had took her time and gently handled my hands, kept asking if she was hurting me but in fact i was falling asleep haha! It took them about 1 hour and 30 minutes to do gel nails which again i dont mind if the work is awesome and they massage your hands so nicely!! New favorite nail place!!

So i really liked this place at first. I was a forever customer but now ill never be back.. The past few times they charged me up the ass for just gel polish.. $45 just for a gel polish on my natural nails!! Next time i went in got a full set with normal polish for $60... PLUS they no longer cover their debit or credit fees, so expect to pay more for using your card unless you have cash. I dont mind paying for the work, but the work isnt that good for the prices.. i guess i need to look for a different nail place.. really had great hopes for this one. Oh well.

Im going to update my review because this place deserved it.  Chi the manager contacted me for the bad experience and offered to fix my nails for free. I went in and Tracey fixed my nails and they came out perfect. She did amazing work and her and Chi deserve kuddos for their friendliness and great customer service skills. Tracey was very personable and nice to talk to.  She remembered names of customers and had a nice conversation with me.  They took care of the issue quickly and did it in a way that was tastefull. Thank you Chi and thank you Tracey.  I WILL be back because of you guys.

Well, the reviews dont lie! This place is the shit. I had to go all out and get 2 meat patties. The burger was as big as my head. Not only that but ooooh so good! The fries were on point as well as the ranch! I admire this place. The staff are extremely friendly and so nice. The burger comes with shredded letuce which ive always loved on a burger and the cheese is soo good it looks like it would belong on those grilled cheese commercials where they pull it apart and you can see the cheese just pull but not break. Ughh this place has my heart. This is soo not a good thing for me.  The chips and salsa were good too! Ill be back!

This taco shop is amazing! I came here right after class one day and ordered 4 tacos thinking i wouldnt be full. Just about 2 tacos did it for me. I ordered the pastor and asada. Pastor is definitely my favorite. The asada is pretty good for those not into the spicy meat. They have all the toppings on the side for you to put on yourself which i truly admire. Their salsas are great tasting and i enjoy being able to pick between corn or flour tortillas. They are a bit small and parking is extremely limited. Definitely worth a try and something to bookmark.

This place was a little hard to find, but i found it! And thank god i did! Its a cute little resturant, very mellow inside. I ordered the pain perdu and it was awesome! VERY different from what im used too but very good. The pain perdu came with bacon which was a nice mix of sweet and savory. The texture of the bread was a little weird reminded me if i was eating a very very stiff but moist cake. The only downfall i think would be there are A LOT of flies inside.. it was hard to eat because i was constantly shooing away flies.. But other than that i enjoyed myself very much.

I really like this place! For someone who doesnt really like sandwhiches i love it! Its very cute and i love the decor and seating area. I got the #11 which has bacon, cheese, tomato, cream cheese, and egg. I knew the sandwhich was going to be rich tasting right off the bat because of the cream cheese. To be honest i wasnt expecting a lot of bacon, because lets be real here, what place actually puts a lot of bacon in anything? To my surprise it was filled with chopped bacon. 4/5! Also to add the ladies at the front were extremely nice!  And of course the REAL reason i came here was because of the #55. Nutella, banana, peanut butter and roasted almond goodness! Ugh. Im a sucker for anything chocolate and peanut butter. Oh my gosh this sounded like heaven and it was!!! 5/5 This is the only reason for my 5 star review. I didnt know such thing even exsisted on earth. This will def be bad for my wallet and ill pay for it at the gym.. damn

I knew seeing the picture of the pizza i was already going to like it. This place is amazing and on top of it they have a drive thru! Ugh yesss! The place is cozy inside and the food smells wonderful! The service is a little bit off though i feel like they are too comfortable where it takes away from the good service. I dont mind being called sister or girlfriend but if i was on a date or a more formal meeting i dont think that would be ohk.. But all in all the food was amazing! Im craving it again today and i just had it last night! Hate to say it but i ate the whole pizza to myself..

I highly enjoy this place. You get a lot for a decent price. The layout is similar to subway and chipolte where you make your own thing with what you want, but in this case with ENCHILADAS! You can pick between corn and 50/50 corn and flour. Honestly i wasnt expecting them to be so good. I ordered 2 and really i only needed 1. I tried their tacos as well which were amazing too. Again i got 2 tacos and really that was enough.  Tacos 4/5 Enchiladas 5/5 Short rib meat 5/5 Chicken 4/5 Pork 3/5 Cornbread 5/5 - fill your enchilada with this! Best ever.  Its a nice mellow hangout spot and i will be back because the food is so good!

This place is alright. To be honest i wouldnt be back. I had high expectations and seeing so many great reviews i was excited to try this place. I was extremely let down.. Being that its my first time i wasnt able to try the flavors. This sucked because i would have loved to try one of their cool flavors before i got it rather than just paying for something i may not like..  To start, i ordered 2 #10's with marshmellow to add on both. I didnt get very many strawberries, and seeing others get a lot turned me off..  The oreos, which i had A TON of were just stale. They tasted as if they had been sitting out or expired. I ended up scooping out all the oreos because it was just gross.  The marshmellows that i had added were the highlight of it, even though it was just a regular marshmellow.  I asked for nutella and got chocolate sauce. Figures. As far as the "snoh" goes, its alright. The strawberry snoh does not really taste like anything. Kinda hard to like or dislike something if it doesnt really have too much flavor.  We ended up throwing away our snoh not even finishing it. The games were disgusting and havent been wiped down for ages it looks like. For the price i could have went to another place and had a better experience. $14 is ridiculous to pay for "snoh" if im barely getting toppings, the place is dirty and i dont even get the right toppings. As far as my friends snoh, they didnt enjoy it either. They wont be back, and sadly neither will i. To each their own.  Sadly yelp failed me on this one.

So i do love longhorn, but i feel that its a hit and miss on what you order..  The ribeye is ALWAYS great. I get mine extra seasoned because i like the spicy pepper flavor. The ribeye is always juciy and tender, at least when you get it cooked at Med.  I got the prime rib this time and it was not at all what i was expecting.. in fact i dont ever remember prime rib tasting like sugar? Hmm. I think ill stick to my ribeye.. My server Dale was pretty good. He didnt really bother me too much like some waiters do. What i will say though is he brought my check super early before some of my food came out.. i felt rushed or like he didnt trust that i was going to pay for my food. Also after bringing my check something i was afraid was gonna happen was they were gonna stop servicing me.. i never got a refill and it took forever to flag him down to bring me a box but i just ended up leaving because i couldnt get a box for 20 min.. Would have loved to take my food home. A bit disappointed seeing that im a regular customer.. I did try their mixed berry lava cake which was excellent! Very nice and moist. Not too sweet. The hostess was a bit awkward when i walked in. I guess saying table for 1 was unheard of before? She just kinda looked at me like a deer in the headlights look.

My first time here, and being a wing lover i was expecting a lot from this place... We ordered the Loaded Fries which werent really loaded. But the fries were good regardless. I treaded on to order the wings with medium sauce. The wings were not bad but def not first on my list, or second. They had a really weird coating on them almost tasted sugary? Im not sure what it was but almost everything fried had a sugary taste to it. Maybe its the oil they use?  The waitress was really awkward almost as if she didnt want to serve us or we were a bother to her. She forgot boxes and drink orders a lot, when she was only serving another table and us.. I did expect the place to be crowded but it was a ghost town.  I dont really know how i feel about this place other than its really different and not my thing. I usually dont try out places that are under 3 stars, and this is why..

This place is pretty awesome. I love street tacos its been a new thing of mine. Ive been to plenty of taco shops and this one is amazing. Im craving them right now. Menu is pretty simple. We got 4 Asada tacos and 2 chicken tacos. Let me just say the meat was the best. You can really tell that they grilled it with the flavor. Meat was tender enough. Chicken was juicy. A bit expensive but i think well worth it!   One thing i would change is they should add a little more array of salsa. They have one REALLY hot red one and a nice green one. Maybe add a mild one in there?

So i decided to come here based off the reviews. Oh my was i surprised i was going to like this place. Menu is pretty simple, but the food on the other hand was far from simple. The food was amazing, i truly enjoyed my meal and im not much of a breakfast person. The food sat good throughout the day with me and i didnt have that yucky breakfast food coma that i mostly get from other places. The food here was so rich and different, i almost crave it again and i just had it a few hours ago. ALSO SIDE NOTE: THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE PANCAKES. So for you gluten free people, they do cater to you as well! Please give it a try!!

So as a first timer im a little disappointed. I got the breakfast pot pie with the egg on top and a side of bacon. The bacon was so rock solid with no flavor. Plus i got just bits and pieces of the bacon not a full slice. 3$ for that?!  I guess i came in to late that they couldnt cook it fresh? Not sure. The hash browns were pretty good and the pot pie was good. I asked for hot sauce and the guy brings me a empty bottle? I let him know and he never came by to give me a new one. I also never got a refill on my drink after asking twice. I guess i just have terrible luck with that, seems every resturant they forget.  The service was alright. I dont think ill be back though. Really was looking forward to this place sucks how it turned out.. i wanted to order pancakes to go because they sounded so good, but i passed and kinda glad i did.. I dont think ill ever be back sadly... Also the music is really a bit much for kids. Maybe it was just the wrong time of day but not a place to bring kids. The music says bitch, motherfucker, hoe, pussy, dick, sex things of that nature. Not something a kid should be hearing. Not that i have an issue but if your looking to bring your kids, beware.

This is a DECENT place. Ive been here 2 times.  1st time i had gotten a full set with gel color. Not too bad, but not the best. 2nd time just a gel color. It was alright not great or awesome but decent. They were very friendly and wanted your business. Felt like a valued customer. Work on the nails was a bit bad. I dont think they have a lot of nail techs because theres usually only 1 guy there and ive gotten him both times.  I left with some cuts on my fingers and uneven polish with ruff edges. This is an okay place if you want to go somewhere decent. But extremely pricey for the work you get..

This taco shop is great. I really enjoyed coming here it tasted great and they were very friendly! Looks pretty small on the outside but when you get in, there was a dencent amount of room. The tacos were pretty small for the price and not a lot of meat. I think ill try the Al pastor next time instead of the Asada, maybe it will be a better hit. But still great place to try and will be back!

Omg. Amazing!  The food here is so rich and filling, i couldnt get it into my mouth fast enough.. i seriously was in heaven..   The salsa bar is to die for. All their salsas are amazing. Im a sucker for salsa that has a good garlic taste with a kick. These were perfect for my taste buds. I enjoyed EVERY single one! They are not overly spicey either where you can enjoy your food. Also you get free chips and you bet i got every single salsa to go with my chips and meal!  I ordered the asada street tacos. It came with rice and beans. They were AMAZING. Beans were rich and creamy, rice was salted perfectly. The meat was not fatty at all, which is huge for me because most resturants have such fatty asada.   The place was decent and extremely clean. Artwork was amazing too. There seemed to only be one waitress in the whole resturant which was fine she was nice and attentive. The place is decently priced and well worth the food if you enjoy mexican. Honestly i wasnt even done with my meal and i was already plotting when to come back and tell everyone how good it was.

To start off it was an hour and 30 minute wait. Many people were being seated before us which was a bit weird.. and an hour and 30 minutes was a really long time.. We became the only ones waiting while there were many tables open. After the host left and a new one came we got a text right away that our table was ready? Hmm. We were sat and the place was almost empty. I ordered 4 tacos- The standard -4/5 The best out of the bunch. Carne Asada- 3/5 it was good but so much fat on it.. 2 Pork Adobada- 1/5 had a really nasty after taste.. Chips and salsa- 5/5 too bad the second round is $2 bit much for chips and salsa..  The food took a ridiculous amount of time, again another hour and 15 minutes for our food on top of already waiting an hour and 30minutes. We ordered quickly too, being that we waited so long we had already looked at the menu and ordered our drinks the same time as our food. The waitress said she took our drinks off for the wait, which is kinda funny because we ordered water.. that makes sense? Not. Thanks for taking off our drinks that werent even on the tab to being with..  I know much better and cheaper taco places than this. Not only that but i wasnt even full after leaving. I ended up eating at home, and to be honest i wont be back. Looks cool and everything but i would recommend not wasting your money, and trust me you will be wasting a lot of it here.

This place is really small but nice. I went in around 12, lunch time. The girl at the counter recommended the pulled pork burrito but i got the asada burrito instead. It was good! Very rich and creamy. I loved the mexican rice and refried beans in it! Cheese and sour cream? Uh yes!!! I would call this my perfect burrito. The asada meat had great flavor but a lot of fat to it? Too much fat in the burrito ruins the experience.. But still an awesome burrito, i think ill get the pulled pork next time knowing the asada has so much fat on it.

Will never go to another steakhouse! Longhorns steaks are the best. If you want buttery rich melt in your mouth steak this is the place to go. Never have i had a bad experience. I used to be a texas roadhouse lover but Longhorn just puts Texas roadhouse to shame. Forever a fan.

They REALLY need new staff. I went in with a couple of friends to get drinks a few times, the hosts that were at the front were kinda snotty and stuck up, the guys at the bar didnt look like they were even interested in serving drinks to us or others. We decided to order food, and they werent too bad but like i said before they really need new staff! The waitress that took care of us didnt bother to check up on us, she was snotty and acted cocky. I asked to speak to the manager, she said she would surely get him. We waited 2 hours! No manager, and no waitress!! Really?! I called later that day after we finished and a young lady answered and i asked to speak to a manager she asked what it was regarding, i told her a complaint and 2 minutes after she hung up. Come on.. so now ill just write a review on here. This place has decent food, but the staff there is what will be the death of them.

This place is pretty good and one of the best taco places ive been too. I decided to try them and see what all the hype was about.  I ordered 3 large tacos pastor, meat was juicy and i like how you can put what you want on it- 4/5  Asada burrito was pretty good and fullfilling - 4/5   I still love my taco truck better than these tacos but will forsure come here again when i dont want to make the drive to 16th street or when im just craving a quick taco.  Also i wish they would be open later than 7pm. I would def come here after night class but due to the time they close i wouldnt make it.

The represenatives there suck. They rather argue with you and explain why they are right rather than listen to what you are saying. They think they know the answer to the question before you ask it. Each month i pay on my loan a minimum of $100, they decided to process my direct deposit check towards my loan, which i didnt authorize, and split it into 17 payments for that month and charge me interest on each payment!!! What the hell?!!? Then a $400 electronic transfer to my savings account aparently was lost according to them because of their system, and told me that i probley wont be refunded that money. Are you kidding me! What a joke. I closed out all my accounts that day, never have i ever had a bank steal from me, not only that but poor service from an employee there. ( Fanny Cona) thanks for the bad customer service, ill be doing business now with Arizona State credit union.

Canes is one of my favorite fast food places. I rather eat here than BK, McDonalds, Wendys and so on.  If you are going to eat here, you MUST get their chicken fingers EXTRA CRISPY, or the breading will fall off. Also, i highly advise using salt and pepper because they dont salt anything, which is standard for most places seeing that some people have different standards of how salty or peppery they want their food. The fries are normal french fries, nothing fancy. The sauce is a nice touch to their chicken fingers for sure. As far as the menu, its small, simple and to the point. At canes they do chicken fingers, and in my opinion they do them well. But to each their own.   Are their fingers 5 stars, eh they arent 5 stars but they are very good. The service is questionable at times but for the most part good.

I was so excited to come in today and boy does Yelp not lie!!  This place was truly amazing. A 2 meat platter is enough to feed 2 people, but if your greedy with BBQ like me, you'll keep it to yourself. Meat and BBQ sauce was amazing although i couldnt really tell the difference between the hot bbq sauce and sweet one? Hmm. Bacon Maple donut for dessert?!? MUST TRY. Peach Cobbler with whip cream was awesome too!  Was SO FULL but couldnt stop EATING because it was SO FREAKING GOOD. The owners are very friendly too, and they really care about their customers. Taking time to remember names and where they come from, as well as constantly coming to the tables talking to you making sure your happy. Not just a " how is everything?" and walking away.. No, no, no, they are bound to have more of a conversation with you.

I went here based on the reviews. First timer and a forever customer. Friendly staff and food was great!!! Im a wing lover so nothing beat long wongs until now. They are basically the same as long wongs if not better! Fries are AWESOME.  Ranch is AWESOME.  Wings and wing sauce are AWESOME!!  Kinda pricey but i dont mind if wings are awesome!

I was really looking forward to this place.. im so torn. I am a HUGE wing lover and i wanted to make this place my regular stop because its so close to my house.   To start i ordered 10 wings. The guy behind the counter told me i could get 2 flavors. I picked lemon pepper and original. I really wish they had medium but the guy said closest to medium would be original. They have soo many cool flavors to pick from, but at least keep some originals like medium. Not a bad price for 10 wings 2 flavors and ranch. I also ordered a side of fries seasoned.  It all went down hill when i got my food.. I will say the wings were crispy like i lovee! But when i tried them i did not like the flavors. The original was nowhere near medium like the guy said.. The lemon pepper was pretty good, i didnt mind those. The fries on the other hand felt like such a mistake on my part. Everyone on yelp liked the seasoned fries so of course i had to try them. They were soo seasoned i had to take a napkin and rub it off. I know to not get them seasoned next time. The ranch had the same seasoning as the fries and wings, i mean it was on everything.. which i did not like because too much of one thing is not always a good thing. I wish i could have tried the sauces before i picked them.  I like that they have kool-aid thats a plus! The staff was nice too! Would i be back? I dont really think so.. i so wish my experience was better..

WOW. This place was what my taste buds needed! Its everything i hoped it would be. The prices are a bit up there but its well worth the price. The food is amazing. The place is big inside with a lot of seating. The customer service is friendly and staff are mellow and outgoing. Great to have in a place with amazing food.  I got the Beef on Weck with onion rings. Those were the best onion rings ive ever had. Very much homemade. I couldnt stop eating them and i ate more than half before even getting to my beef sandwhich. Now the beef sandwhich was amazing too. Seasoned perfectly. The sandwhich came with au jus. I did not like the au jus one bit. It smelled like wet dog for some reason? Not a nice beefy smell which was weird. But the sandwhich didnt even need the au jus. If a sandwhich that comes with au jus doesnt even need it then that really says something! Its a must get if you come here.  I also ordered the wings, medium. The wing sauce was not what im used to but i still loved it. Coming from a bad experience from a wing place the other day im happy to report these were perfect. Which is really sad that a place that doesnt just do wings has the perfect wings. Sounds silly to me. What i will say is i asked for my wings extra crispy and i didnt get them crispy... i was a little sad about that. But still very good. They dont charge you for extra ranch which i admire from them.  There was an older guy seemed to be the manager who was making sure the staff was wiping down tables and cleaning the salt and pepper shakers which was very nice to see. It looked clean and it felt even more clean to see them constantly wiping things down. I give them major props for that. He was very helpfull and interactive with the guests. I hear their hot dogs are good, honestly i cant wait to try those. Im not a hot dog person but im hoping they will change that. I will be back probley tomorrow too!

This place was alright. Everyone was raving about it so i had high hopes, but compared to the other taco places ive found i wont be back to this place. These tacos arent anything special. Again, plenty of other taco shops that are way better and cheaper! The meat was dry and the tacos were so small. Maybe i came on an off day but it was enough to turn me away with the price and portion. The ladys working the place were nice and friendly, so thats a plus!

I was debating on going to Cravin Donuts shop but i decided to try this place instead. OMG was i surprised! The donuts are def different in texture and taste. The donut is fried with a krisp outer shell. Amazing. I loved the options they had! A raspberry glazed donut with chocolate was my perfect donut. Raspberries dipped in chocolate has always been my favorite so seeing this made my heart flutter! (Black forest donut) I also loveeee bananas and chocolate so the Mad Monkey was also another favorite. These 2 donuts alone will make me a forever customer. God knows i love fruit dipped in chocolate so anything that taste like that is perfection to me. Worth a try and a great experience watching fresh donuts made in front of you!

I didnt think that the burgers were gonna be that great. Seeing 3 stars i really wasnt expecting much. The pictures are what really sold me to come here and im glad i did. It reminds me of In n Out except the meat seems to be a lot bigger and seasoned. I got their double shack burger and i just fell in love. I cant really tell what the Shack sauce is supposed to be and i couldnt really tell it was there. The bun was buttery and soft. The cheese just oozed everywhere. 5/5!  As far as the french fries im not much of a fry person. But these were crispy and perfect. Ugh, you can tell just by looking at them that they are going to be perfect. 5/5!  Try their strawberry mint lemonade its different but soo good!  What i will say though is this place is really over priced.. my meal for a drink, fries and a burger was $17. You pay for everything on the side, nothing comes as a meal which is what makes it so pricey.. be ready to PAY because you most certainly will.  Will i come back? Yes!
