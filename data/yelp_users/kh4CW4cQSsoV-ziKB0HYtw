Ironic that one of the translations of "arrivederci" is "goodbye" because that's exactly what I'm going to do - kiss this place goodbye!  I want to like this place - I like the environment and Ahwatukee has a severe shortage of variety in restaurants.  But this was the second time we gave this place a chance and it was just as bad as the first.  Our first experience, the service was ridiculously slow.  The waiter got my order wrong and when he finally brought the right order it was cold and my husband was nearly done.  I was hoping for a different waiter this time around to get a more well-rounded experience but sadly that was not the case.  Service was still slow, and communication was severely lacking.  I had to ask for water twice; the second time another waiter overheard and said "he didn't hear you, but I did - we're low on water glasses right now" and proceeded to give us water in wine glasses.  Totally acceptable solution, but the original problem should have been provided to us by our waiter.  We never got the specials.  Didn't know they had any until we were midway through our food and overheard waiter #2 telling the table next to us.  The only thing good about the food we got was the fresh bread.  I ordered the tortelloni bolognese and my husband ordered the fettucine alfredo with mushrooms and chicken.  I don't eat mushrooms, but I like the flavor - and in my opinion, mushrooms (rich flavor) and alfredo (rich flavor) seem like an overwhelming pairing and my husband said it was a strange combination.  There was something wrong with my tortelloni bolognese.  How one messes that up, I have no idea.  The sauce was watery, and there was an odd aftertaste in a few bites that were reminiscent of cleaning solvent.  I barely ate half and didn't bother taking it to go.  The tables were squished together; it was a regular occurrence for the staff to bump into each other.  The manager seemed loud and overbearing.  When another table near us also had a subpar experience, he comped their meal but was incredibly brash and loud about doing so.  They left even more annoyed than we did.  They must be doing other things right because the restaurant was full - we clearly just have not been on the receiving end.  However, two chances is all I'm giving.  Arrivederci, Arrivederci.

My boyfriend and I are house sitting in the area and were in the mood for Italian food the other night.  Belfiore's had decent reviews, so we figured what the heck.  What the heck, indeed.  Although the bakery side was modest and somewhat welcoming, the restaurant side looks like it used to be a Kyoto Bowl with some Italian art thrown on the wall.   It was right around 8pm on Saturday night when we showed up, and there were 3 other tables with guests.   Despite the low number of other patrons, our waitress - although sweet - forgot we were there after she served our drinks.  I wasn't very hungry, and all I wanted was something along the lines of a capellini pomodoro with fresh tomato chunks, basil and garlic.  The closest they had was tomato sauce.  I should point out here that it was my boyfriend who found Belfiore's on Yelp, so I hadn't read the reviews and had no idea that their portions were so huge.  It was like they had taken an entire box of pasta, cooked it, and scooped it on my plate and then opened a can of tomato sauce and dumped it on top.  I really don't know how one can possibly screw up the easiest dish on the menu, but Belfiore's found a way.  I could barely eat it.  They could easily cut that dish in half, keep the price the same ($10) and add fresh tomatoes and basil and still make a good profit.  Their portions do nothing but add to the ever-increasing American waistline.  My boyfriend's dish fared better - penne with vodka sauce and shrimp - although the shrimp was overcooked.  The salads that came with our meal were clearly prepped in advance on the plates, wrapped in saran wrap and stacked on top of each other.  The only thing I liked was the roll.

I really want to love this place, but I just can't. My friends and I have given them two chances and both times we left feeling underwhelmed.  Both experiences were after our wine making and bottling experience at Casavino Winery down the street.  The first time, we knew nothing about the restaurant except that it looked warm and inviting from the outside. The ambience is lovely; it feels cozy and intimate. When you get that vibe from a restaurant, you just know you're in for a treat, right? I wish.  We had a ditzy waitress who clearly knew nothing about the menu. I asked her what the lobster ravioli was like, and she responded with "I don't think there's actually any lobster in it." Really? No lobster in lobster ravioli? Choosing to play it safe, I opted for the cheese ravioli (which was quite tasty). I also thoroughly enjoyed the pizza crust bread they brought to whet our appetites. However, the service for the remainder of the evening was consistently mediocre.  We decided to give them another chance tonight since the food was decent the first time. This time, our waitress was friendly and kept a good eye on our table. I once again inquired about the lobster ravioli and she confirmed that yes, it contained lobster. I ordered it with the vodka sauce, while my boyfriend selected it with the lemon garlic butter sauce that she highly recommended. Our friends both ordered ravioli as well, albeit not lobster.  ONE HOUR LATER our food arrives.  Our waitress was very apologetic about the wait and ensured our bread bowl was continually replenished, but we were quite anxious for our entrees....which showed up COLD.  At least, the two lobster dishes did. Mine tasted fine when it was finally heated up, but my boyfriend and I definitely didn't care for the lemon butter garlic sauce. Once again, our waitress was very apologetic and assured us that she served us as soon as the chefs were done, but at this point, considering we're rarely in the area, we're done giving Sapori D'Italia chances.  It's a shame - there are so many rave reviews, and the little family run business has a lot of potential....but they have some kinks to iron out.

I ordered my dress back in January, but I wanted to wait until the wedding was over to review the whole process soup-to-nuts.    My mom flew out specifically to go dress shopping with me, so I crammed 4 appointments into a 24 hour period.  Lillian Lottie was my 3rd appointment.  I thought I had found my dress at appointment #2, but I wasn't ready for the experience to end (isn't that a rule on Say Yes to the Dress or something?).  When we went to Lillian Lottie, they were still in their previous cramped location.  Regardless they had a friendly staff and I quickly picked out several dresses I was interested in trying on.  I'm not one to try something on, spend minutes admiring myself in the mirror, and then move onto the next one.  No - the moment I see it won't work for me, off it comes.  So in a relatively short amount of time (well, for trying on giant poofy princess dresses), I had tried on 15 gowns and narrowed it down to 4 - and 2 of them outranked the one I had thought was "mine" at the other store.  The staff (sorry, it's been so long I can't tell you who helped me) was incredibly patient with me and kept bringing dress after dress until I found "the one".  They were great - they seemed like they were just as excited as I was that I found the dress!  And yes, I canceled appointment #4.  They told me it would take at least 6 months to get the dress in - it actually took around 5 (hooray!).  I used their seamstress for the alterations, and she was very friendly and knowledgeable - my dress fit like a glove for the wedding, and was exactly the right length (we took what little train there was off).  Since that trip, I've referred multiple people to Lillian Lottie; not everyone ended up finding their dress there, but all of them raved about their experience.

We planned to go to Nimbus for dinner the day after they opened, but knew it was going to be busy.  On a whim, my boyfriend called to see if we could make a reservation and was told that while they were still getting the computer terminals in place, they would call him back to let him know if it was a possibility for the time we wanted.  Sure enough, they called back and we got right in despite the hour-long wait for everyone else.  We were enjoying their delicious beers when the manager came over, looking for my boyfriend by name.  As it turned out, he was the one managing our "reservation" and wanted to welcome us personally.  Hello, VIP treatment!  He continued to check on us throughout the night, and even brought the owner over at one point - likely because our party grew from 4 to 6 to 9 to 12!  Regardless, we felt like we got the red carpet treatment, the customer service was that good.  They still have a couple kinks to work out - some of the wait staff was a little green, but I certainly wouldn't hold that against any of them on day 2 as they were all working hard to make a good impression.    The food was good, but the beer was better.  I don't normally like certain beers (stouts, pale ales), but I would have been content sipping on any of them.   They have a relaxing patio and a great vibe overall.  Although this particular restaurant space has seen some turnover (it was previously occupied by both Roy's and Taberna Mexicana), I hope they stay - I will definitely be back!

I put a lot of stock in sites like Yelp and Trip Advisor and depend heavily on non-biased reviews, so I feel I owe it to Yelpers to disclaim that I know the owners of Solo.  It is family owned - guaranteed you will see mom Jackie and/or one or all of the 3 sons around.  I was a little leery of visiting a restaurant where we knew the owners - what do you do if it's terrible?  Turns out I had no need to worry - we left extremely satisfied.  Ambiance - I would describe it as modern Italian.  It's a smaller restaurant, so it definitely has a more intimate feel vs. the huge, noisy chains around the Valley.  They also have a small bar area good for happy hour or if you just want to enjoy a nice glass of wine and watch sports after work if you happen to work in that area.  Service - server was great; unfortunately I don't recall his name, but he was attentive, polite and friendly.  Food - my fiance and I went with another couple and we wanted to try as much as possible, so we ordered 2 pizzas and 2 pasta dishes and shared family style.  I should note here that their dishes are traditionally Italian (i.e. on the smaller side), where you can have a first course of pasta, second course of meat, etc., so I would not recommend ordering 1 pasta dish and splitting it for 2 people (although American meals don't last 3-4 hours the way Italian meals do, so I wouldn't order a first course and a second course - 1 will suffice!).  Also if you want bread and dipping oil, it's free but you need to request it.  They use Corto Olive Oil, and it's incredibly flavorful.  Anyway, we ordered the Chitarra and Fazzoletti pastas and the Coppa and Salsiccia pizzas.  Everyone at the tabled raved about the Chitarra dish, which is vaguely reminiscent of a spaghetti carbonara but lighter and with big hunks of pancetta.  I think we all wanted to lick the plate clean.  The Fazzoletti is a pesto-based dish with peas and while it was good, it was lacking something - we couldn't put our fingers on what, but it needed some kind of pop in the dish, like sun-dried tomatoes.  However, that's my personal opinion and what appeals to one may not appeal to others.  One member of our party loves peas though and couldn't eat them fast enough.  The pizzas were both delicious - the chef does a wonderful job with the crust.  The Coppa was a cheese pizza with chili flakes, and it was my fiance's favorite dish because of the spice.  The Salsiccia was my personal fave - sausage AND caramelized onion?  Sign me up!  We also tried a cheese board (mmmm cheeeeeese....) that had some great cheeses but I couldn't stop eating the giardiniere (pickled veggies) which accompanied the cheese and even purchased a small container to take with me.  Dessert (because dessert should always have its own section) - I was in a gelato mood, but I was easily swayed when I heard the description of the Nutella Budino.  It's a little like a Nutella souffle/pudding cake, and was so delicious I really did nearly lick the bowl - I kept scraping my spoon in the bowl for every last taste.  Luckily, the other couple ordered gelato so I got to try the pistachio, mascarpone and strawberry flavors.  I believe they said they get their gelato from The Grateful Spoon next to Postino, which I love, so it was no surprise how tasty it was.  Wine - LOVED seeing an Arizona red on the menu so I immediately ordered that (Arizona Stronghold Mangus).  However, I also tried their house Malbec (Ruta 22) and that was great as well.  Overall, we were thrilled with the restaurant and look forward to returning!

This was my first experience with Maya, and I won't be disappointed if it's my last. The place looks beautiful, I'll give them credit for that. But my husband and I walked up at 12:30pm on a Saturday and were informed that cargo shorts are not part of the dress code but that they would "let it slide". Seriously? During the day you're nothing more than an overpriced pool bar and cargo shorts aren't allowed?  But you'll allow the ridiculous 80s high-waisted Jordache denim shorts that should have stayed in the past through your doors? Makes perfect sense. Gotta add some women to the sausage fest waiting to prey on them, after all.  And who's the genius that decided to keep your snack bar closed in the middle of the day when it's 105 and climbing outside?

My fiance and I moved to the area right before Ginban opened, so I've been curious to try it.  I'm so glad we did!  They've only been open 3 weeks, so there weren't many people inside but I'm hoping they're able to build a good customer base to stay open.  The atmosphere/decor was closer to something you would see in Scottsdale but not obnoxiously so.  They still have a couple kinks to work out - we had a waitress, but the sushi chef took our order (they don't have the traditional paper menus at most sushi restaurants) and the waitress didn't know that.  However, I think because we were sitting right in front of him at the bar he just took care of us.  We ordered yellowtail sashimi, the pikachu roll and the spicy girl roll.  The sashimi was delicious, although I was a little taken aback that it was served in a margarita glass over crushed ice and the glass changed color.  In my opinion, that part wasn't necessary.  My fiance really enjoyed the spicy girl roll - the crunchies mixed in with the spicy salmon on top were a nice addition and overall the roll had a good spice to it.  The pikachu roll was unlike any other roll I've had before - it has lobster salad, bbq eel, avocado and tempura banana.  Yes, banana.  All of this wrapped in soybean paper and drizzled with eel sauce.  We wolfed it - it was so good.  I would say it was a delicious way to end the meal, but we also tried their tempura green tea ice cream.  Also quite tasty, and the sushi chef said they made the ice cream in house.  I really hope this place sticks around - we look forward to coming back!
