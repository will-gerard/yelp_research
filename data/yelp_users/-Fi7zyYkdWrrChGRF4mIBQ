Wow!!! Amazing experience and install in my 71 Chevelle. I got constant updates via Ryan kept me informed of the progress and any suggestion to the build. My system sounds like a professional audio car that goes to competitions. Everything is clean and install spot on. They made fiberglass kick panels and custom box blown through rear deck.   Will bring my other rides here for sure!

This location review based off of experience on Thursday morning. Walked in and the store was clean and empty. I was actually only customer there. I was greeted promptly for my order. Within 5 min order was complete.  I ordered the cheese and egg omelet. Tasty pretty tasting but shocked at sticker price for sandwich.  Cost $7.50 for foot long and drink.  Side note subway change the pee color branding (like booth seats) with something more updated. Just look yucky and dirty even when clean.

Good clean movie theater. Of course the food is way over priced. Good note you can bring in bottle water from outside in.  The seats are pretty comfortable.

Wow first time I went to tire shop and did not feel like I got screwed on price. I just recently visited this location for 4 37" tires for my lifted Jeep Jk. I really wasn't looking to buy any tires for couple thousand more miles that day. I walked in was greeted very nicely and promptly by sales associate. He was very knowledgable on the different tire options I had. I told him that I was going out of town but I would like to order them since it was a good deal. He placed the order scheduled me for the following week. Yesterday  I went to have the tires installed and the mechanics quickly switched out my tires and off I was on my new 37" tires. Thanks! I will be for sure a repeat customer.   Tip: Call make appointment a head of time so you limit your wait. When you get wheel balancing it is lifetime! Last tip is that they have a fridge inside with free cold bottle water as you wait. Enjoy!

I love a good old DQ cone every once in a while. Sure they cost more than Mickey D's cones but no where as good. I went to this place couple days ago and the temp was 108F! When I saw the DQ down the hill I just had to stop and grab a dip cone. My daughter and I first had to make a potty break. The bathrooms were clean but just showed age of wearing. We went to the counter and ordered our cones. The cones were perfect! The manager misunderstood my daughter's order but without any issue quickly gave her a new cone. The manager was very friendly and nice. I am glad I stopped here because reminded me of playing baseball as a kid and went to DQ after the game.

Been here numerous times. Food is decent but i think tad over priced. Customer service has always been good. The crowd is typical church crowd.

Food was good when it came out. I had some issues with the staff but the manager took care of the issue at hand. I would probably go back based on the manager ability to handle the situation properly.

This is by far the best yogurt place I have ever been to! I am a yogurt snob and I am glad that I ran across this place. The first thing I notice is that the owners keep pride in making the place spotless! Secondly the workers are very friendly (couple cute ones) and always willing to give you a sample cup. I recommend trying a couple sample cups to see what you will like. The flavors are awesome and some are switched out every so often. Some yogurt places have a weird chemical taste to it. This place does not have that taste at all. The price is also by far one of the most competitive in yogurt industry. Yummy tummy!

Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection.

Ordered several items from them. There were ups and downs but the owner and the manager Steve really try to make it work out for you. Steve has always been great at following up as well.

Very clean and usually empty. I have been to several gyms in the valley and this is top for being clean. The gym equipment is nice. I went for several months didnt have complaint.  I dont know why people do not go here but it is empty. Check it out.

Where do I start? I honestly rarely leave a bad review and never had a bad daily deal site coupon experience before. Lets start from the moment I walked in. Actually rewind before that so you get the whole picture. After playing a softball game I was starving and did not want to cook at home. So I pulled out my trusty phone and wizz to my daily deal coupon app I had at Humble Pie. Literally I drive across town to eat here with my mouth watering. As I walked in the door I get hit with a funky smell. At first I thought it could of been me since I was playing softball in 110F weather but wait it wasn't  me! The smell was sewage. I pulled up my pants said well I drove across town and I am starving so I will just ignore it. After I waited for about 5 min no one came to seat me so I just sat myself at a table. About 10 min after that I finally had a waiter come over and take my order. Must of been a test to see if you really could stand the smell (like one of those hidden camera shows).  I went to the bathroom to wash my hands before I got my meal. The bathroom was below average. Was not horrible but more like college dorm room bathroom where you are happy you have soap and roll toilet paper. The food came out pretty quickly after that. The salad and pizza I thought were pretty small servings more like kid menu items but I did not care since I was starving but it tasted alright. At the end I waived my waiter down to pay the bill. I told him I had a daily deal site coupon and he said no problem since your bill was below $20 you just have to cover tax. The waiter said he would have to get the manager to run the promotion deal. The waiter came back 5 mins later and said well you ordered a special so you cant use your daily deal site coupon unless you pay full retail. I was thrown back with this because I did not order special but just an everyday item. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over, I told him what happen. The manager was confrontational about the situation which totally threw me off track. I was like dude your place smells of sewage, bathrooms could be cleaned more than 1 time a day, someone could greet you as you walk in and lastly,  learn to  manage the situation better. In the end I debated with the manager for about 5 min over the situation and paid the tab to get out of there. So for over $5 disagreement over the bill this company has lost a customer for life.

I went to Mr. Parker's office because I saw a blog about him helping veterans out with court case at a local Veteran help day. I called his office about a CS issue and he met with me right away. He discussed my case in great detail and gave me REAL Professional advise and no BS. I walked in nervous but I walked out with my head up. Thank you for your professionalism.

This was my first visit at this location. I originally was going to a shop in Scottsdale with a talented artist Christine. My last session was scheduled far out so I could enjoy my summer of swimming. My first impression of the shop from the outside was mixed. But when I walked inside I really like the openness,friendly staff, and each artist room semi private.   The artist CHRISTINE V. was amazing as usual. She is busy artist that you typically have to book in advance. If you need to cancel your appointment you will probably have to wait couple weeks for next open slot. That I do not mind as peace of mind that I am getting tier 1 tattoo artist. (I am getting something inked on me for life so patience is a virtue.   You can see my tattoo done by her Iron Patriot (Iron man) if you dont know what that is.   Christine V. always very pleasant to work with and makes your mind get off that a needle is stabbing you million times while you sit there.

This show is awesome! I brought in my chevelle to do air ride suspension. After getting under the frame of the car the shop discovered multiple items that needed replaced. They took care of it! Great communication along the way as well.

Incredible work out! Love everything about it here. Every time I come I feel like I left with a good workout. The coaches know their stuff and are willing to teach you.

Wow what a amazing place to eat! Hidden gem 26th st and Thomas. The wings with medium sauce are tasty! The pizza is thin crust and I don't feel like a carb blog rest of the day. The establishment is clean and the atmosphere is nice with outdoor seating. Plenty of TVs to watch the sport games as well.
