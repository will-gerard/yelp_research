Came here today for a transmission fluid flush. They were pretty quick and got the job done.  Friendly service and no hassles or no one trying to sell me something I didn't need.  I would come back again.

We love this place, the food is always great and the prices are unbeatable.  The food is still as awesome as it was with the previous owner.

Been going to this place for years.  Best Pitas in AZ.  Salads are great too. Pizza is good and the homestyle frys are also great!  Don't go during the lunch rush hour!  It gets crazy!

We love this place. Like homemade Mexican.  Rice is fluffy and fresh, enchiladas are great. My wife loves the green chili plate. This place never disappoints. .

My wife and I eat here every chance we get.  The food is excellent, service is always fast and friendly.  You can't go wrong with any of the pizza's.  We usually get the margarita with pepperoni. My wife loves the linguine with clam sauce.  I love the Rigatoni Al Forno and the four cheese ravioli. This is one of the best places on the west side for some real good Italian!!

This place sucks. No pickles?  They give you a whole pickle for $1 and you have to slice it yourself. If you want mustard they give you a packet of mustard and you have to do it yourself.  If I wanted to slice my own pickles and add my own mustard I can just make my own sub at home. This place has the worst service and too many rules for making a sub.  Port of Subs and Blimpie are much better!

Waited two hours for a big party. Waited another 30 minutes for the food.  The food was okay but definitely not worth the wait.  La Parilla  Suiza is much better!

The food here is pretty good and very cheap.  Their orange chicken is really good.  They also have great lunch specials and they deliver.  The service is always fast and friendly.  If you like good Chinese Food at a good price this is the place.

The food was good, service was excelent, this place just opened last week and so far so good.  I had the Chicken Shawarma with fries, lean chicken, needed more sauce but that's an easy fix.  The fry's tasted just like McDonald's which is a good thing! Prices were pretty good too!  Glad to finally have a Greek Place in the West Valley.

called them two days ago, no answer, no call back. Sounds like they are out of business or don't give a rats ass about customers.

My new favorite place!  Pulled chicken and pork are really good.  The burrito and the 3 taco combos are my favorite!  1000's better than Chipotle!

We came her last week and were very impressed.  This place is in our neighborhood so we felt we had to finally try Mejico.  The atmosphere is top notch. Very clean and has an awesome authentic Mexican d√©cor.  The place isn't huge but the patio outside is one of the nicest we've ever been to.  The staff was excellent.  Very friendly courteous service.  They food was delicious.  I had the red chili enchiladas with rice and pinto beans and it was all very good.  My wife had the green chili shrimp relleno.  We had the Queso Fundido appetizer and that was also really good.  Hope Mejico is here to stay!!

Came here on Saturday since we are new to the neighborhood.  The wings were great. We had the smoked honey-hot and they were perfect. Lots of smokey sweet flavor.  We also tried the Hawaiian pizza and it was also delicious.  The pizza had a light and crispy crust and it was perfect.  Our server was very friendly and did a great job taking care of us.  We will definitely be back.
