Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Customer service was awful and my car wasn't even clean. Seriously, as I was driving away I noticed it hadn't even been wiped down inside. I would have driven back to complain, but was too upset by how I was treated by the men who were washing my car. Never going back. Ever.

Great place to take old furniture. Also, they have some cool used stuff, if you're looking. Customer service was good, as well.

I'm neurotic and stress myself out to the point of giving myself migraines. My neurosis also causes me to work out like a maniac. Tracy helps alleviate the symptoms of both conditions. She is amazing, kneading the knots out of my muscles and digging into the tension. She customizes and is always accommodating. When I'm there, I'm always relaxed and leave feeling refreshed and really...like I never want to leave :)

I absolutely love this place, not only because they do an amazing job but because of the customer service. I so appreciate his sarcasm and offering me hot cross buns. Such and old school feel. I drive from downtown to take my clothes here because, as he tells me, "You know I'll take care of you, dear."

So disappointing. Was craving bubble tea and this place seemed legit. Ordered an almond milk tea and when I took a drink, my mouth was flooded with imitation almond flavoring. I got an instant headache and ended up throwing it alway.

My favorite place to grab a hotdog! Love the lavash bread and every topping you can imagine! I went a little crazy with the sriracha last time, though :)

Based on a lot of positive reviews, I clearly was with the wrong stylist. I was referred to The Waverly (specifically Ryan) by a coworker, but couldn't get in with her. Being a new mom, I said it didn't matter which stylist I got, I just needed to get in! Either way, I accepted the appointment for a basic trim with Jessica. I brought my 5-week-old son in with me and she was very curious about him. I understand small talk, but she kept asking about my husband (his name, job, where he's from, etc.) and then asked my son's last name. I found this a bit creepy. Even putting that aside, it was the worst haircut I've ever received--totally uneven. Very disappointed in this place, especially considering the price. I feel like Great Clips could have done better.

I think we ordered all of the appetizers and all were amazing. The service was outstanding, too!
