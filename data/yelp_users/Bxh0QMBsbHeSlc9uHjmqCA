The chips and salsa are fantastic...that's what keeps bringing us back.  This is my one year olds favorite restaurant as she loves the salsa.  The food is pretty good...I have to admit it's not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's always consistently good.

Horribly slow service, we only saw our server once to drop off the check.  My husband and I wanted a quick weekday lunch as we had to get back to our jobs, food and service were slow an my husband waited 15 minutes for a refill on his fries.  Food is descent but not worth the horribly slow service and kitchen, plenty of better burger places in the area.  I would prefer my money go to businesses that take interest in their customers and don't provide horribly slow service.

Wasn't impressed with the food at all.  My husband and I dropped over $90 on food that was mediocre.  Service was horrible, our server never checked on us, and we were sat at a table with no condiments like salt and pepper and no bread basket was given with our soup.  (We paid over $10 each for our soup.). Food wasn't bad, but certainly not worth the inflated price.  Service and food were both extremely slow and disappointing.  Plenty of better restaurants in the area more reasonably priced.  Second experience:    We gave Tommy Bahamas a second try.  So happy we did!  Night and day difference from our first experience.  Our server Jonathan and manager Dre were both very attentive, personable and had great suggestions.    The view was beautiful sitting on the second floor with open windows overlooking the city/mountains.  We ordered the scallop sliders as an appetizer, they were incredible...my only complaint is I wish they had more as they were so tasty!  The kitchen was much more prompt  this time.   The lobster bisque soup was amazing with a spritz of lemon.   I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken which came with cauliflower mash and broccolini very tasty, and I will definitely be back to order again.  Both my husband and I throughly enjoyed this dish.  My husband ordered the Ribs which came with a cabbage island slaw and cauliflower chive mash, all very good.   For desert we had the pineapple creme brûlée.  Light , refreshing and definitely would order again.    My husband and I were extremely impressed from start to finish.  From the service, to the kitchen and the food, it was definitely an experience that will bring us back soon and on a more regular basis.  Thank you Jonathan, Patrick and Dre for doing such a stellar job!

This used to be my husband and I's favorite restaurant for many years when the original owner owned it.  Every since then, it's gone through a series of different owners.  For some time, we swore this place off after the original owner left as the food quality was severely lacking.  The food has improved, but the prices have increased drastically and they no longer do a reasonable lunch special.  I ordered stuffed peppers and the peppers were stuffed but tiny, definitely not worth the $16 price.  It seems the food portions have gotten substantially smaller and the food prices have gone up considerably.   The taste of the food isn't bad, but not worth the inflated price. We used to see a manger on the floor fairly frequently, but now it seems there is rarely/if ever a manager on the floor; service can also be hit or miss. We use to come here almost weekly, but have reduced our visits to maybe a couple times per year.  North Phoenix needs a reasonable/good quality Greek restaurant...Big Fat Greek is not cutting it!

My husband and I ordered the winter roasted vegetable salad, vegetable salad and the Mozzarella fontina pizza.  My daughter ordered the child's Mac and cheese.  Food was delivered quickly and the manager Cameron was very attentive and made sure we enjoyed our dining experience, he was also very personable.    I thoroughly enjoyed  vegetable salad and the Fontina pizza.  My daughter also really seemed to enjoy her macaroni and cheese and I liked it as I could tell it was homemade and had none of the artificial colorings that many of the kids macaroni and cheese have.  Great dining experience, we will definitely be coming back.  It's a child friendly restaurant but adult enough where I would come here with girlfriends for a glass of wine and a salad.

I love this place!  Food and atmosphere is great...especially when it's cooler outside and you can eat on the patio.  I love that they serve healthy, organic food.  Their lunch specials are very reasonable, but dinner can quickly get costly.  The downside is the service can be slow and sometimes it feels like they are understaffed. However, even with the shortcomings the quality and taste of food is great.

One size fits all, my husband and I went to Dr. Craig for at least 6 months.  I only saw Dr. Craig one time and my husband never even met him!  When he put me on Metformin it elevated my liver enzymes, dr. Craig told me Metformin wasn't metabolized through the liver and to stay on it...my primary doctor immediately  took me off and informed me metformin is know to elevate liver enzymes.  We had other issues with the office not calling back, etc.  He may work for some people, but he certainly didn't work for us. We found much better success with another fertility doctor that individualized his plan and helped bring our daughter into this world.  We saw Dr. Craig back in 2009, I am hoping his practice and office staff has improved since...but I wouldn't hold my breath as the office seemed to be a infertility sweat shop.  With that being said...I did have one friend who had success with Dr. Craig...but several who did not.

We've been coming here for over 8 years, our favorite pharmacist is Brandon.  He's incredibly knowledgable, friendly and gets to know his customers well.  He's noted a few times potential drug allergies or drug interactions between different medications and refused to fill them (thank goodness, as he was correct). His follow through with contacting insurance/doctors, etc. is top notch.  We mostly only come to this pharmacy because of him.  The rest of the store is good, it's always clean, well stocked and the employees seem nice/attentive.

Great theater for an 8 month + pregnant woman.  I actually felt very comfortable in the reclining premium seats.  Service was good as well as the popcorn.  I would definitely come back, but not on a regular basis as the tickets for the Premium tickets are much more costly than a regular theater.  With that being said, it was well worth the inflated price to feel comfortable for an evening and enjoy a movie!

Great owner and takes interest in his customers!  I went and wasn't impressed with the food, owner contacted me apologized for the experience and asked that I give his restaurant another try.  Any establishment that takes the time to reach out to a customer and apologize for their experience...is a restaurant I want to support. My husband and I will be back to try the food again.

Food was good...but atmosphere and service could use some help. It also didn't seem very clean. It was very warm and they weren't running the A/C.  Needs decorations, a thorough cleaning, and major renovations.  I feel bad to give this review as I am sure the owners have limited finances. I have also only been one time...so it could have been an off day.   I truly wish this place well, with money and renovations it could be an AMAZING little hole in the wall Pho place. I would come back...just most likely I would get take out next time.

Great pizza for the price, we will definitely be coming here on a more frequent basis.  $5.00 for two slices of Huge New York Pizza with a drink, it's got my vote!  The Greek salad was also good, I love pizza by the slice and my family of three was all able to order what they liked.

We've come here several times.  I love the pizza and the food is very good...especially for the price.  However, my husband and I are almost throwing in the towel on this place as the hygiene/cleanliness of the restaurant leaves much to be desired.  The tile feels oily and gross, and the establishment needs some major TLC and deep cleaning.  With the restaurants overall  lack of cleanliness it starts to make you question food preparation, etc.  Also frustrating as we waited over a half hour for wings and were completely done with our meal when they arrived.  If you can get past the cleanliness/hygiene the food really is quite good.  Disappointing though as with a little TLC it could be a great pizza by the slice restaurant.     My first time visit:   Great pizza for the price, we will definitely be coming here on a more frequent basis.  $5.00 for two slices of Huge New York Pizza with a drink, it's got my vote!  The Greek salad was also good, I love pizza by the slice and my family of three was all able to order what they liked.

My husband and I went to the Desert Ridge location and were less than impressed, food tastes processed, etc.  we decided to give this location a shot.  Night and day difference!  Food was fresh, reasonably priced and portions were very generous. I got the steak plate with baba ganoush, cabbage, mushrooms, cucumber and tomatoes and taziki sauce.  My husband ordered the Gyros, and although he liked it wished they would have told him they put rice, etc in it (he will remember this next time he orders to ask for the rice, humus, etc. on the side.). My daughter loved the kids gyros.  We will definitely be coming back, healthy food reasonably priced.  I also love that they serve organic milk with the kids meal.

Amazing!!!  Food was incredible.  My two year old daughter couldn't get enough of the date shake and humus.  Every dish we had was fantastic and the owner was very involved and super nice, it's apparent he truly has a passion for good food and pleasing his customers.  We will definitely be going here on a regular basis, more than worth the 20+ minute drive.

Food wasn't bad, but the meat dishes had too much clarified butter.  The service isn't really service, we were never checked on during our entire meal until the check was dropped off.  (This was frustrating as we needed more injera bread for our meal.)  Also, one of the meat dishes was a little cold.  That was a huge turn off.  It was very smoky inside which made it difficult to enjoy our meal.  My husband and I love Ethiopian food, but I think for a better overall experience I would go to Cafe Lilabela in Tempe.  Maybe a quick lunch, if I happened to be in the area and was really craving Ethiopian food I would return.    With just a few small improvements like better service, giving more Injera bread with the meal, fans to vent out the smoke, and ensuring that all the dishes are hot, it could be a descent hole in the wall Ethiopian restaurant.

Outstanding pizza and outstanding service!  Reasonably priced and great quality.  My husband and I loved the specialty BBQ pizza with Gorgonzola cheese it was one of the better pizzas we've ever had.  My two year old devoured the Oreo milkshake.  Caesar salad was also very good.  Server Lou was outstanding!  She was very friendly, knowledgeable and had great suggestions.  We will definitely be coming back on a regular basis and suggesting this restaurant to friends, much better than some of the other build your own pizza places we've been to.  Also very kid friendly. Definitely 5 stars!
