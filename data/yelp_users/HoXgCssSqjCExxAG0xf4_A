Haven't had anything I didn't like. Good food and a very fair price.  The French toast are very cheap and huge portions.   Hey don't take my word for it , try it.  Tell them I sent you

Happy hour is well worth it.   The service was good , my waiter kinda got lost in the crowd ( maybe he can crowd surf).

Lunch chimichanga, try the chicken or shredded beef. The carnitas is the best I have ever had.   Chips and salsa is the bomb.  Best Mexican in Arizona. Places needs a remodel but good people and great food.  Well worth it. Deserts are also very good. Best flan and fried ice cream ever. At the end of the day, it's a must try.

Had the garden tea for two.  Not very impressed at all, the food was stale.   The soup came out and it was very nasty.  I had no expectation when I got here but I'm telling you this place is one to avoid no matter what.   There customer service is worse than there food...  ******* avoid at all cost ******

Rice is rock hard.   Jaded chicken taste like its been sitting there for days.  Brought it to the young girls attention and they had to say was oh.  Plenty of people eating here but maybe they didn't get the rice? I think I may have just come to Late and there menu is to big for them to make it fresh when they order it.   Oh well. Plus they give you free chips and salsa for a good review on this.  Reason for all the stars on here? You decided but don't say I didn't warn you.    Maybe there chips are good and worth the stars.  Guess I'll never know

Food is excellent.   Place needs an update. You could easily share these gyros and chicken dinner no question about it.  Must try it. Bet you keep coming back.

Very good service , they don't have the flavor( syrups )  to add to the tea like most others do, they tell you the cost is too high yet they have the highest sales in the valley, go figure.  The food has always been very good.  No major issues at all, there very consistent with quality and attention they provide.  Probably the best carrabarras  around.   If your in the neighborhood skip the other and try this one.

Steak was good , service wasn't the best at all... The odor from the bathroom didn't help at all.   Went in to wash my hands and no soap, the smell of urine was unbearable... Asked to talk to the manage and was able to get the PROPERTIER JOHN JOHNSON  ... He wasn't very receptive and not good at handling very helpful feed back.... I just explained that they just opened and no reason there shouldn't be soap or a horrible smell in the bathroom.  I'll make sure to avoid anything he Owns or manages.

Remind me to stay away from this location , I'm going to miss there  cookies and cream milk shake and there fries. Not going to miss them putting there finger all up in my shake.  Not cool buddy, I did nothing to you but be respectful. Young kids working drive thru, no excuse you say.  I agree, there Mama didn't show them that your hands especial around food can get you sick.

Ordered a pizza and sub to-go (Keep in mind this was my first time here)  the place looks clean plenty of people in there eating lunch , I was in line waiting to pay and I seen the cook poke his nose and wipe it on his pants he continued to prepare more subs and pizza with out washing his hands.  I ask to speak with a manager (Andy) he ends up being the manager  and I was very respectful when I asked for a refund and gave him the reason.   Stay away from this place or at least just only eat there when Andy the nose picker is not working*** but from what I understand he's been there 3 years.

My favorite are Rachel's homemade cinnamon rolls they are only Friday and Saturday and they go fast so get there early.  The frosting is vanilla bean very light no cream cheese taste.  My son loved her gluten free whoopie sandwich brownies.  Her chocolate croissants are to die for.  She is very creative.  My husband ordered me a small cake for our anniversary and it was excellent very Cutely decorated.  Her case is not always full best thing is to order as a special order.  Also want to mention her  twix cookies sandwiches .. Shortbread cookies with salted Carmel and chocolate filling, yum! I'm so happy she is located in Queen Creek not to far from home.  When I am craving something sweet.  The owner Rachel is very personable and friendly you will see her there all the time.  It's a little expensive but consider a fresh sweet treat. Hey you decide if it's worth it.  Enjoy.

Stay away  unless you like nasty and dirty food, in that case proced.  I seen one of the cooks rub his nose like really, really hard, would almost consider it picking with the same glove he decided to make my burrito with.  Had to turn it down.   Stay away.  Not worth it.

Fried egg and bbq burger is the best burger for fast food.  The Rosemary fries hit the spot.   The kids burger is a a good size if your not starving.  Make sure you fill out the survey on the receipt , it gets you a free side. That's like $3.00 bucks free chris is the man there, ask for him and tell him I sent you.

Best chicken fingers in town for fast food.  Fries are bomb. And get lemonade it's also really good. Don't come here if you want a burger, chicken fingers only. Get the Caniac feeds two.

This location is very nice, the portions are huge.  When I arrived the place was fairly full, I got seated within 5  minutes, Christian happen to be very cool people, he took are order and no joke with in 5 minutes the food came out in sections but they where only minutes apart.  I would ask for Christian again , very attentive and customer service oriented.  He made sure we had the best experience possible there.   Maybe they had issues when they first opened but that's not the case today.
