One of my fav chinese spots in the valley!  This is one of those places where if you choose the right menu items it's super awesome but I think they got a few things they are not great at, like their kung pow.  I've been going here for years so here are some of my favorites:  Hong Kong Style Chow Mein, Salt Pepper Pork, Sizzling Beef Short Ribs, Garlic Friend Shrimp, Crystal Shrimp, Lemon Chicken, Wong Jo Chicken, Madarin Beef.  You'll find lots of local people here.  Lots of asians!  Good sign that the food is good right?

This is my typical spot I go to when I want some good Hawaiian/Korean BBQ.  This place is just like places back home in Hawaii.  The owners are from Hawaii.  I love this spot because this is the only place in the valley where I can find a quick korean bbq stuff.  The other Hawaiin spots are good too but don't serve Meat Jun or all cool Korean side dishes.  My favorite dishes are the meat jun and kalbi.  The kalbi has great flavor but its a hit or miss on the portions.  Some times I get surprised and there is more than usual but sometimes I get pissed and wonder if I should come back for Kalbi here again.  The Meat Jun is always a huge portion.  Probably cause the meat doesn't cost as much as kalbi meat.  It's a great alternative for people looking for good Korean BBQ.  Most korean restaurants are way more expensive than here and more sit in restaurants.  I always order out at this place but I did notice the nickel and diming they do with all the small stuff like refills and stuff.  I hate when places do that too but its a rough economy and the owner have always been super cool with me so that stuff doesn't bother me I guess since the food is good.

I have a Toyota Prius and have had my car serviced here a couple of times.  I didn't buy my car from this dealership.  The first couple of times I didn't have any issues with this dealership.  They didn't do anything that was so awesome that its worth mentioning but they did what I asked and was fairly friendly.  Now that brings me to my last visit there.  I recently moved out of state and as I literally got on the freeway to make my drive, fully loaded moving truck following behind me, my car breaks down.  I started having electrical issues galore!  I somehow managed to drive it to the dealership just a few miles away from where I initially broke down.  At first my service manager was super friendly and helpful.  He got my car back pretty quick and was keeping me up to date via phone as I proceeded with my move out of town.  He knew I was moving since I pulled up with the moving truck behind me and of course I let him know of my situation.  I luckily have amazing friends so one of my friends offered to take care of my car and drive it to me once it was repaired.  One would think...Phew...dodged that nightmare.  Eh wrong!  After my car was looked at by one of their technicians they found that my regular battery not hybrid battery needed to be replaced.  They couldn't even do further diagnostics until I did that.  I thought, okay a battery, not too bad.  That is until they told me it would cost me almost $400 to put in a new battery.  I was like WTF!!  That is ridiculous.  I'm not very handy with cars but I'm sure even I can replace my own battery.    After some chaos on trying to find a more economical solution.  My friend changed the battery out for me.  He went to the dealership, bought the battery (which was $200 for the battery itself), and installed the battery himself.  He had to change the battery down the street since they would not allow him to do it on the property.  That part is one of the few things I can understand.  I get it, its a liability.  The part that I don't get and why I'm so pissed is after my friend returned the car to the dealership to get further diagnostic testing.  Once the dealership got my car back they did nothing to it.  They didn't even bother looking at it again.  I called the next afternoon after my friend replaced the battery.  My service manager was kind of rude and acted disinterested.  He basically said that they were backed up from yesterday so he'll let me know once it gets back.  This was around 4 pm the next day and it hasn't even been looked at???  He basically talked to me in a way where it made me feel like they'll get to it whenever they get to it.  I let it go and told myself lets see what happens tomorrow.  After calling several times and wasn't able to even get anyone in the service department to answer the phone, I started to get real pissed.  Once I finally got someone on the phone, that service manager didn't even know what was going on.  They didn't even know why my car was there.  The first service manager was not working that day.  I went through my explanation of events with this new moron and realized that I just needed to get my car out of there because it was going no where.  They had no interest in servicing my vehicle correctly and were obviously pissed at me for not paying their ridiculous rates.  I sent my friend over to the dealership shortly after that call to get my car.  It took them awhile to even figure out where they had parked my car.  Even more proof to their stupidity.  I told my new local dealership here about the incident and they confirmed that they were totally jacking me on the battery.  They sold the same battery here for $180 not $200 and if they had done the service it would have cost me $275.  That's still a little high for a simple battery change out but at least somewhat reasonable.  I feel like Riverview Toyota totally took advantage of my situation.  Knowing I really didn't have much choice since I was right in the middle of a move.  I'm glad I decided to get my car out of there because who knows how long it would have been before they felt like getting to my car and who know how else they would have tried to jack me.  I got my car looked at here at Toyota Poway.  Nothing else was wrong with my car so I'm relieved.  Got much better service this time.  Save your time and your money and don't go to this dealership!  They are very unprofessional and are thieves that give dealerships a bad name!

This is my favorite italian restaurant in Phoenix by far!  My favorite dish is the capricosa dish.  I've never seen that dish served anywhere else.  I typically order it with Chicken and Shrimp but sirloin and shrimp is also great.  I love small family owned places like this.  Even though I love how nice their new place is, I kinda miss the hole in the wall feel their old place had.  The owner is super cool.  He even made me a dish once per request that wasn't on the menu.  I got back from a trip from Italy and asked if he knew how to make some of these dishes.  If you ask the owner and eat in, they will make things that are non menu items.  Another favorite of mine is the Lasagna.  Its so good that I normally don't eat lasagna at all but I do theirs.  That's how good it is.  I think the only thing I ate there where I wasn't super impressed was their pizza.  I haven't had it in years and it was just once but it was okay.  Everything else though is amazing!

I love hole in the wall places like this one.  This is one of the best sub spots in the city, if not, the best spot in the city.  You'll find it in NE corner of Apache & Terrace, in a liquor store of all places.  There is no sign outside for Hangover Hoagies but right when you walk into the liquor store you will see it directly to your left.  This was a nice Entertainment book find for me.  The food here is awesome!  They use great ingredients here so I think any sub you choose will be great..  The portions are huge.  Their large is 3 meals for me.    They don't have much table to eat in and unless you enjoy the ambiance of the light glistening off the bottles of alcohol.  I recommend doing take out.  The only grip I have about this place was I went there several times before their post closed times and they were closed.  The owner was real cool though cause he hooked my bf and I up with some free subs for the inconvenience so there is no real gripes I have about this place :)  I only hope to find a place like this in San Diego.  Or else I may just have to go back to AZ to get me a good sub.

I wanted to find a mobile groomer because my Shih tzu Marley had been having issues with groomings since he got attacked by a pitbull.  The pitbull attacked his head so he would be difficult to groom around his head.  I found a great mobile groomer out in San Diego that he did well with but most of the groomers here kept trying to convince me my dog was bad.  It was hard for me to believe because he is such a sweet dog.  I felt like if he just got a little more love and patience then it would be fine.  I searched around online for different mobile groomers.  I was impressed with how informative their website was and after having a conversation with Kay the owner regarding my concerns, I felt it was worth a shot.    Ashley was the one that ended up grooming Marley.  She was pretty quick, about 30 mins.  I was shocked cause his groomings always take forever.  I was shocked to see how happy Marley was after his grooming.  He even followed me back into the trailer when I was paying Ashley.  I have never seen Marley so happy and comfortable with any groomer.  Surprise surprise...Ashley said Marley was no problems whatsoever.  This leads me to believe that I was right.  If a groomer was just more patience and caring with Marley, he would be just his usual self, which is super sweet and loving.  For all you dog owners who may have a similar issue with their groomers, don't believe them.  It's really on the groomer.  I highly recommend Arizona Pet Stylist to any dog owner.  Both Ashley and Kay are a pleasure to work with.  And most importantly Marley had never had such a great experience!
