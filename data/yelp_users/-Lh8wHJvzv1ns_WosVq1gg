Wonderful experience!  I was being called back before they got me completely registered.  Would visit here again...although I hope I don't have to.

Too expensive and they won't let you on the trampolines with your 2 year old. LAME!!!! Go to Jump Street instead... More toddler friendly and much cheeper!  To give you the full picture, this was the second time we had visited this facility.  The first time we had a wonderful time.  Not only were we allowed to jump on the trampolines with our 2 year old, we were encouraged to do so.  When we returned for a second visit, we were told that we could not join them on the trampolines for the little ones for safety reasons, but that we could jump with them in the dodgeball area.  I don't understand how they believe that this is any safer.  If one of those balls hits her, she would be down for the count.  I can appreciate them wanting to promote safety, but they are going about it the wrong way.  I was told that this policy was an "industry standard."  I have been to a couple other indoor trampoline parks and they allow parents to join their kids on the trampolines in the area(s) for the younger kids (up to 7 years old).  Industry standard, to me, indicates that everyone has that same policy.  Additionally, their prices are we too high.  I would encourage you to shop around......you may be surprised.
