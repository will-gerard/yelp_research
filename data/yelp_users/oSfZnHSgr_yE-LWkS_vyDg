Here on Summer special. Nice property but ratty sheets in bed required changing, burnt out light bulb, only 1 robe, no towels at the pool. Rough start, 1.5 days to go. ;(

Tried Emily's today because it popped up as close by on my phone. No greeting when we walked in, no sign to let us know to seat ourselves, waitstaff walked right past us as we were standing in the middle of the dining room. Got past that, party seated after us had order taken before us. Ordered borderline omelet and BLTA, which arrived promptly and looked great. It tasted great too (comments about brown eggs in other review,  that's the chorizo). Sandwich very good, side salad is a lightly dressed arugula, potatoes did NOT have too much Rosemary). Seasonings are all listed on menu, so if you don't like Rosemary, ask for a substitution. Prices fair, portions just fine. Check easy to get. They just need to up their game on the greeting/welcome and they'd be a nicer experience. We would go back for breakfast and we might try lunch sometime.

We really enjoyed our first visit to Chef Douglas's Bourbon Cellar for my birthday!! Great, intimate dining room and attentive service! Bourbon list is extensive...and several selections of wines by the glass at moderate prices.   We both LOVED the lobster Mac-n-cheese and the potato soup. Both starters had so much flavor! The Sea Bass was amazing... Incredibly moist and flavorful and it was big! Grilled asparagus made a great side. All topped off by mini-desserts of just the right size. Definitely a great date destination.

Stopped in on a whim after stopping next door for cigars. Decided to celebrate my birthday and ordered the mussels, bacon wrapped dates, carpaccio and a bottle of Smashberry wine. All delicious. The mussels were excellent and fat in a nice sauce. Loved the Smashberry vintage. Just wish there were more of the dates! :)  Then the Seafood Paella arrived complete with smoking sage! Really good with big chunks of lobster, mahi-mahi and shrimp. Delicious!  We loved the old Cellar 13 and missed it a great deal. So happy the location is open and serving up wine and tapas next to the Maduro cigar shop!
