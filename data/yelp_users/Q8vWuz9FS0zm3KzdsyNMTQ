I have been taking myToyota Camry car to desert for thr past one year.They are always on the top with their service and the way they make the customer happy.The service was done well and they even agreed to give me good discount.

Went last week for unlimited biriyani and chat. I liked the samosa chat which had the right spice. Even liked the chicken biriyani.The chicken was tender and well cooked.Icing on the cake is you get everything unlimited incuding one dosa for $9. Would defnetly recommended this restaurant.   Also the manager was very cordial and would defnetly visit the restaurant again.

Except the vijayawada biriyani nothing is good here. I got the veg biriyani four times and it was always stale.I trashed it in garbage. Not sure if they prepare fresh biriyani often. And the prices are expensive for the stale biriyani they offer.

Horrible and filthy location to get a pizza or salad. My wife ordered for salad yesterday and she found cockroach in the salad.Be careful before getting a salad here..
