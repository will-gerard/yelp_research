Great selection of otherwise hard to find products. Decent prices. My only complaint is the fishy smell.

Came for dinner with my family, and the food here was not good. The hot and sour soup was barely spicy or sour, and had a strange gamey taste. Thank god they had chili oil and vinegar on the table. The tea tasted like plastic. The crab puffs were decent. My husband got the beef fried rice and found a smushed gnat in his food. Additionally, the rice didn't seem to be actually fried. It was more like steamed rice with stuff in it. The chicken with honey ginger was ok. I liked the pickled ginger. Overall, would not return here.
