Wine+ Happy Hour folks! =0  I've never heard of this place but I came here for happy hour with my co workers. Everything was reallyyyyy good and reasonably priced. We ordered so many mixtures of things. We got to build our own flatbread and also ordered Charcuterie. My bosses ordered everything which was amazingly delicious.   The wine! I love Pinot Noir so every time I go to any wine bars I love trying them. I ordered the Apaltagua Reserva. It went down so smoothly. The good news is when you check in you get a free wine tasting! The second one I chose was the Rainstorm. This one was also tasty but has more of a kick to it since there's cinnamon in it.   I really liked this place. Everything was delicious and the staff is beyond friendly. They REALLY know their wines! Not to mention they have so many other "festivities there! They have a lot of events there, you can join a wine club, they have wine classes, and they even have live music there on Friday and Saturday! You can't go wrong with a great happy hour and great wine to go with it! =)

I felt like having steak one evening and I don't get to go to many steak houses so we decided to try this place out.   Everything was pretty much on point here. No wait for a table when we arrived. I ordered the Prime top sirloin with a side of rice. This was an 8 oz steak. I always order my steaks medium and this came out exactly that. It was super tender and just the right size because I actually finished it. It wasn't too much or not enough. I had some of my boyfriend's mashed potatoes as well. I'm usually not a big fan of mashed potatoes but these were actually pretty good. I also ordered the Sweet Peach Tini which was delicious. I felt like I was drinking an Iced Tea.   Everything was really good as well as the service. I'll definitely be back if I want another steak! =)

My friend recommended this place to me since I'm EXTREMELY picky when it comes to picking a hair stylist. Every place that I've been to before Santa Fe I was never completely satisfied. So my friend told me you HAVE to ask for Tara when coming here. Boy was she right! She is extremely friendly and very accommodating to your needs.   Tara does an amazing job with my hair. I always leave here loving my hair cut. Not only is the hair cut and style important to me, but also the way the hairstylist trims my bangs as well. I'm almost never satisfied with my bangs cut everywhere I go, but Tara has never disappointed me in this area as well.   The only thing I haven't gotten to experience yet is getting my hair colored with her. That is something I definitely want to try in the near future and I'm sure my fellow Yelpers will be hearing about that journey as well. =) I absolutely LOVE this place and can't imagine going anywhere else to get my haircut now. I'll be extremely disappointed the day Tara retires. lol. Not to mention it is down the street from my house which is another plus.   You definitely won't be disappointed coming here. =)

This place is the shizzzzz..... Like literally.. They blow starbucks out of the water..Sorry Starbucks but that's how I feel.   I never get anything fancy if I do ever go out to get coffee because I usually just make my own. When I do go out though I just get an iced coffee or a caramel machiatto. & at this location it's perfect. The best part about this place? The view. It's right on a lake so it's very peaceful and relaxing. I love coming here with my friends for some coffee and to hang out or even going by myself for some alone time. Plus the customer service is great. You usually need a minimum purchase of $4 I think to use your credit card. But the guy let's me get away with it on most days. lol. This place would definitely be trouble for me if I lived across the street from it. =)

Sushi AND happy hour? Ok, you got my attention... =)  This place is super close to my house and I'm actually in this area all the time yet I've never even heard about it. I met my friend here for happy hour last week. We ordered so many rolls that I can't even remember them all. The philly roll, las vegas roll, shimogamo roll, and much much more and ended with some oysters.   We sat at the bar and everyone was extremely friendly. I thought that the sushi was actually reallyyyyyy fresh. I love Philly rolls so I always have to try them everywhere I go. This was probably the best Philly roll I've ever had. It was everything I asked for. lol. They also have drink specials as well. My friend ordered some sake while I got their Red house wine. Two of those glasses and I was gone. lol.   I felt like it wasn't HAPPY hour because even with happy hour pricing it was still pretty expensive. I think everything came out to about $70+. Doesn't sound like happy hour pricing to me. lol.   I would definitely come back though. I really loved everything and it's so close to my home. I left completely satisfied. =)

Definitely not one of the best happy hours I've had unfortunately... =/  My co workers wanted to come here for happy hour since it's right down the street from our office. I never even knew it was here since  the location is not great at all. It is not close to the main intersection but close to the back street instead. When you first walk in, it's sooooo dark in there! I almost felt like I needed to turn on the flashlight on my phone to see. lol.   I think the happy hour drink specials were not that bad. $2.50 for wells and wine and certain beers. I got the Pinot Grigio wine. Obviously this place isn't a wine bar so it wasn't that great. We ordered some appetizers as well. The nachos were a fail. =/ It was that type of cheese that wasn't necessarily melted on there but just straight up dry and stuck together on the chips. The wings were ok as well. My co workers ordered the spicy ones. I'm a total wuss and can't handle spicy at all but these were actually not even spicy.   I guess this was an ok place to hang out. I like that they also have pool tables and air hockey to keep you occupied I guess while you're waiting for your food. Because our service was extremely slow. I probably won't be coming back unless the co workers wanted to or for some $2.50 drinks. =P

I've been coming to this gym for what feels like foreverrrrrrr! lol. It has to be maybe 6 years now. =)  It's not one of those glamorous gyms like Lifetime Fitness or LA Fitness but it has everything I need in a gym and I love it. Plus it doesn't cost a fortune for a membership either. But then again I signed up for one 6 years ago. It has all of your basic necessities and everyone is super friendly. I actually hate going to the gym. lol. But force myself to do so because a 6 pack abs do not just magically appear out of nowhere and neither does a toned body. lol.   This location is actually a little bit farther from my house but I like how the machines are set up and how friendly everyone is so it's worth the drive for me. My only negative to this gym is they keep increasing my monthly payment. They tack on a few cents once every few months. I think they make it a small amount so you don't notice it as much but I definitely see it! I started at $18 a month 6 years ago, and now I am at $21 a month. lol.   So if you just need your basic daily gym without the works at a good reasonable price, then check it  out folks. =)

I love Chipotle. I can eat it everyday if I could. I've been going to this location pretty much since I moved into my house and their service and quality of food have gotten worse.   Last time I was here I wanted guacamole in my bowl. They were out of it. I simply asked if they meant for now or they're going to make more for the entire evening. The girl looked at me like I was crazy and didn't understand what I meant because I had to repeat myself three times. I came back today to get a bowl for myself and a steak burrito for boyfriend. After they did the burrito, as they came to my bowl, they were out of both steak and white rice. I told them I don't even want it then.   Note to chipotle, order/ make enough food to last you the entire day. Half the line behind me walked out. Distance doesn't matter at this point because I won't be back to waste my time if they don't even have half the items I want in my bowl.

Everyone is very nice here in the beginning  process of trying to get your mortgage done, but after you're done with your loan, you won't even get an answer from anyone there after they've already gotten their money. I worked with Susan Sowers when i did my loan. Last month I received a statement from Maricopa County stating that owe $600 in property taxes on my house from last year. How is this even possible when I didn't even live in the house yet. After calling a dozen people, including my original lender, Security Title, my new lending company, Maricopa county and being told a dozen different things by everyone, and not getting an answer on where the money went for this, my realtor had to get involved because no one would answer my question. After I closed on my house originally, I received a refund check and no one explained to me what the refund check was for. Apparently Security Title never took out the property taxes that the seller credited to me at closing and included it in my refund check 6 months ago. They never even had the courtesy to tell me that they made a mistake and that I still owed taxes on my house. It wasn't until i received a past due notice that I found out that they made a mistake and never took it out at closing. I will never recommend them or ever use them again. Now I have to pay $600 out of pocket because they messed up and didn't deduct it at closing and didn't even inform me of that. If anything, they should be paying for this since they're the ones that made the mistake. I wish that I could give them zero stars.

They do NOT take Groupons. I repeat, they Do NOT take Groupons. And they make it perfectly clear when you walk in the door. This already threw me off.   This place is around the corner from my house and we saw a Groupon for it so we wanted to try it out. The waitress also wanted to make it clear that they do not take Groupons. We ended up staying for their happy hour. We got a 10 inch pizza with mushrooms, green peppers, sausage and bacon. I've never had a Chicago style deep dish pizza before. I'm sorry, but never again. They went way overboard with the sauce. We also ordered some mild wings that they said were the best wings ever. I thought they were a bit spicy for mild.   The only upside was the beer was very reasonably priced for happy hour. Good service, but I won't be back. You guys are called Rosatis yet u don't accept Rosatis Groupons.

I absolutely loved this place!! So I'm a bit surprised to see the lower rating reviews.   I came here for dinner with the lover. We sat outside on the patio which is absolutely adorable. They have a waterfall to set the mood. Lol. I started with the blue agave margarita. This was delicious! It also comes with a shaker!! My entree I ordered the carne de fuego. The steak at their restaurant is just extremely tasteful. It was perfect. Our waitress also informed us that they have custom tortillas that change on a daily basis. The evening we came we tried a red pepper tortilla that also came with a jalepeno butter. Oh my gosh!!!   I thought that everything was just absolutely delicious and perfect. From the drinks, to the food, to the excellent customer service, to the cute outdoor patio. The only negative for me was I wish they had a bigger menu.  I'll definitely be back for more!!

There's nothing like a good pizza and some wine... =)  My boyfriend bought a groupon for this place so we came here for our date this past weekend. I really liked the setting and outdoor patio of the place. A really good date spot or even a place to get together with friends for dinner. The downside was that their air conditioner was down! We are in Arizona so you can imagine how hot it was. It was actually cooler outside than it was inside. Thank god for those water misters! lol.   We ordered the Toscana pizza and a pitcher of the White Sangria to wash it down. This place actually reminded me of Sauce. They have the thin crust pizza. I really liked it. Ours was more of a Supreme pizza so it had all the toppings that I loved on it. The Sangria was also tasty. Not too sweet like it usually is.   I felt like the customer service was a bit slow. It was a bit busy when we were there so that's understandable. It took them a while to come over to our table just to get our drink orders. When we requested to get some balsamic vinegar with our bread the waitress forgot about it but she did apologize when she finally brought it to us.   Despite the a/c being down and the customer service being a bit slow I would come back. I really liked the food as well as the ambiance of the restaurant. =)

Oh Sapporo... I had high hopes for you.. =/  I came here with some friends this past weekend and I've heard good things about it..  We had reservations, but we were a few minutes late so they gave our table away so we didn't get to do the Teppanyaki... We missed happy hour so we ordered from the regular menu. Let's just say I was disappointed and everything was just only mediocre for me and was extremely overpriced. First, I wanted to try their Pinot Noir. Two of the Pinot Noir's that I picked out they were out of. The 3rd one that I finally received was only ok and it cost me $15! I could've gotten a bottle of wine for that price. My friend ordered a certain Zinfandel and they were out of that as well. I don't understand that because it was a Saturday night. You need to be prepared and stocked for your customers. I ordered the Philly roll of course and the Salmon Tempura. Both rolls were ok but nothing special.   All in all, I wasn't satisfied and was upset at how expensive it was. If anything, MAYBE I'll come back to try their happy hour. I did like their decor and ambiance of the restaurant though, and if you check in then you get a free dish of Edamame.

This is my all time favoriteeeeee restaurant!   My friend and I have been coming here for the last 4 years for our Christmas dinner together every year. I love this place because the food is good, the drinks are good and they have a different Christmas tree every year that makes you anxious to go to see what they have each year. =) I've seen one made of dollar bills, safety pins, martini glasses. This year it looked like a huge lego tree. lol.   For drinks, I've always ordered the Rose. I was bummed because they don't have that on the menu anymore since they can't get the vodka which originally came from France. I ordered the Flirtini and my friend ordered the French. The drinks are a bit pricey here but they are definitely worth it. They are seriously strong and they fill it to the rim!  For food, we always start with the St. Petersburg Potatoes. For food, I've probably had everything on the menu. This time I ordered the Burger Las Brisas. All of the meals come with fruit and waffle fries which are amazing!   This is definitely a great place to come with a date or even a group of friends for some drinks. The ambiance and decor of the place is also amazing. I love it!

He said... I'll take u to wherever u want to go.. You pick... I said Cibo!!!!!!   I had very high expectations for this place because everyone is always talking about it and telling me how amazing it is. I finially got a chance to try it out for the first time this past weekend.    So we ordered the prosciutto pizza.. I wasn't that impressed as I would hope to be. I felt like there should've been more on there. Maybe some basil, veggies, mushrooms? Something? It was just a pizza topped with some prosciutto.  I also got my favorite type of red wine. Pinot noir. Delicious. I definitely love their wine here.   It really is a perfect spot for a date. Super romantic. Disappointed about the pizza we got but I'll definitely come back to try the others. =)

Oh Ticoz.. You've joined my great happy hour list! =)  My friend wanted a Mojito one night.. So of course Yelp came to the rescue and I heard this place has some of the BEST mojitos. You guys were not lying! lol  We came after 9 because they have happy hour. Quite a selection actually. A majority of their drinks are on happy hour and pretty much half of their appetizer menu. For the drinks we ordered the passion fruit mojito and the mango mojito. I really liked the mango mojito. It tasted soooo fresh! I ordered the street tacos. You get two tacos for $5. So I got the shredded chicken and beef. I really liked the chicken, the beef one was a bit salty for my taste. I really liked their waffle fries too. They're seasoned and very crispy.  I really liked this place! Great happy hour items and prices and their Mojitos were really worth the long drive for me. lol. I definitely want to come back to try their other Mojitos not to mention  I love me some happy hour! Til next time Ticoz! =)

Really cute little brunch place! I loved the atmosphere of it!  I came here for brunch with a friend. I think I've only been here once before. I ordered the Potato Hash. This comes with over easy eggs, onions, pepper and a sausage gravy. I really liked the sausage gravy that it came with. I felt like it could've been better with some more meat in it or maybe if there was actually hash browns. Of course I had to wash it down with a Mimosa since it IS brunch AND Sunday Funday. =) Their mimosas are only $5 on Sundays and do NOT come in those skinny little champagne glasses. lol.   I'd like to try something else next time I come and probably sit on their cute little patio that they have. Also would want to try their happy hour. =)

Being a girl from Philly I usually have very high standards when it comes to cheese steaks! lol. & I gotta say this place is pretty up there!   I bought a Groupon so we wanted to use it this past weekend. I've actually been here a few times at their old location. We all know this is the place to go after the clubs at 2 am. It's that "drunk food" I guess you can say. lol. I ordered the steak hoagie while my boyfriend got the regular cheese steak. If you're going to get a cheese steak here you have to get it with the Cheese Wiz! When you check in you also get a free order of fries.   I liked the service here because usually any business that I've been to you can't combine the Groupons with the Yelp deals. It's either one or the other. So not only did we get to use our Groupon but BOTH my boyfriend and I got to use our Yelp deals for the free fries. I ordered the house made ranch as well which is usually 50 cents but they gave it to me for free. The only negative was that it took a while for them to actually place our order.   This is probably the only place that I'll ever go to get a Philly Cheese steak here. Everything was really delicious though and I was basically in a food coma after we left! =)

So we were in the area and heard about this place, plus we had a Groupon so we decided to check it out..  Talk about a hidden location! lol. I figured it would be on a main street or something, but nope. lol. It was down some alley way. The ambiance and environment of the restaurant was kind of weird for me. You have the option of sitting outside or inside. When we walked in I felt like I was in Ikea. lol. It looked like a home decked out in Ikea. Everything from the lamps to decoration to seating. haha  We ordered the Reposado margaritas since they were on happy hour. Hello Tequila! Oh my gosh, it was definitely worth the $5! The food was actually reallyyyy good. I ordered the Fuego Pasta which comes with a special creamy sauce, chicken, mushrooms, sausage and tortillas. I really liked the sauce. Some of the dishes comes with sides that you can choose from. My boyfriend got the creamed corn side and corn bread and they were both delicious! The creamed corn had a hint of jalapeno in it. There was a kick to it but it was amazing!   Each entree is a bit pricey.. we're talking about $20 a plate but I thought it was worth it because it was quite delicious. Other then their hidden location I loved their food. Plus I love me some Mexican/Latin food. =)

Ok so this is how we should watch movies ALL the time! Once you've experienced this theater going back to a regular AMC or Harkins Theater feels like such a downgrade. lol.   I've only been here twice but I seriously love it! The fact that you get the whole Dinner AND a movie experience is amazing. You can't go wrong with comfortable reclined seats and your food and drinks being brought to you. I brought my boyfriend for the first time and at first he was pretty iffy about it and upset that I paid so much for our tickets. But once we got in and sat down he changed his mind about it immediately and loved it! lol. Plus I love saying I told you so. =P  The staff is always extremely friendly and quick at serving you. I think the food and drinks are a bit over priced but you really pay for the experience of the theater I think. I got the bacon cheeseburger which I thought was a bit dry and needed some type of sauce to it. I'd liked to try the drinks next time I come.   Soo.. if you haven't been here? GO! You might feel differently about going back to Harkins after this experience. =)

This place is probably one of my FAVORITE places to get breakfast!  My friend brought me here for the first time a few years ago and I loved it! Everything on the menu is amazing! The last time I went I got the Banana nut bread french toast. It was delicious. One of my other favorites is their corned beef hash. But my other recommendations? Everything! I've also tried their Pecan pancakes which are delicious. I really want to try their crepes and that fried egg bagel next time I'm in or even their lunch menu sounds really good.   The only downer for me is that it's quite far for me, but well worth the drive! &  If you go on the weekends there's going to be a wait since it does get pretty busy. I might be writing another review for it once I try their lunch menu. =)

Me and my lover came here for New Years Eve dinner. We basically just found it on Yelp and made a reservation.   It was packed when we arrived but not overwhelming. The place was decorated so nicely for New Years with balloons everywhere. I started off with the Mirassou Pinot Noir wine. This was delicious and extremely smooth. For our entree, I ordered the Filet Mignon, medium. When they first brought it out and I tried it, it didn't taste medium at all. It was actually more well. Our waiter took my plate back so they can re do my order. A few minutes later the manager came over to apologize for the inconvenience. When they brought out my new order again, the manager was there to make sure it was exactly what I wanted.   Even for a medium, I felt like the Filet was a bit dry. However, they have spectacular customer service. I would definitely come back.

Mmmmmm Coffeeeeeeeee.... was my first thought when I walked in here and got the whiff of coffee that hit me. It smelled amazing the minute I walked in.   I always need my morning cup of joe before I even start my day. Thanks to yelp and the discussion thread that Lindsey started I really wanted to try this place out since it is so close to my work.   I've heard a lot of good things about the White Russian Mocha so I had to try it out and I definitely wasn't disappointed! It was delicious and the staff there was also very friendly and welcoming. I really will have to come back here to try the rest of their menu and their other coffees. My only negative about this place was that it was a little hard to find. I drove around for a while before I actually found it because it is kind of tucked away in the back of the shopping center.   I'll definitely be back here on my days where I don't have time to make my morning coffee. Thank you fellow yelpers for the recommendation as always. =)

Thank you Yelp for helping me find another great happy hour place! =)   This place got really good reviews for their happy hour so we wanted to check it out and of course we were not disappointed. Their happy hour is from 3-7 then 8-close so it was extremely packed when we got there.   Here is their happy hour $1.50 slices of pizza $3 margaritas $2.75 house wines & wells $4 chips and salsa and so much more!  We got the pizza, chips, and margaritas & they were all so amazing! The margaritas are small, but holy fudge they were soooo strong for their size! I got the watermelon which was extremely tasty. The pizza was good especially for a price of $1.50, and the salsa was actually really good. It comes with a guacamole dip and regular salsa which was very fresh.   Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with everything and gave us her recommendations on what was good. And the best part? It's down the street from my house! lol. I can't wait to come back here for happy hour again. =)

The bf wanted to take me out to dinner one lovely evening. I found a groupon for this place so I wanted to try it out.   We ended up building our own pizza. Red sauce with fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, bacon, mushroom and green peppers. It was delicious!!!!  I also ordered the simple life wine that went perfectly with it. I loved it! Next time I'd like to try one of their specialty pizzas.   I really liked this place. It really was the perfect date spot. There's a cute outdoor patio and they also have live music. They would get a five star if the location wasn't so far for us. It was a 45 minute drive. And the fact that they closed extremely early (9 pm) on a Friday night was a bummer. However, we didn't know this and got there at 8:40 and they were very accommodating. I'd definitely be back if it was closer.

Let me start by saying I absolutely LOVE happy hours! What's not to love, everything's half off and it's HAPPY hour! =)   Their reverse happy hour is from 9-close and my friend and I have been going here for probably about a year now for their happy hour. We usually come here maybe once every couple weeks and we are never disappointed.   For their drinks, I usually get their house margaritas for happy hour. It's better frozen but I like my margaritas on the rocks. Or sometimes I get a glass of their house wine since I've been an obsessed wine drinker. =P Their margaritas are $1 off & their wines are $2 off.   As far as their happy hour food, they have a pretty big selection of items for happy hour actually. I've tried almost everything on their happy hour menu and love everything. However, my favorite is their street tacos. It comes with a side of their special avocado salsa Verde sauce. I'm not sure what's in it, but it's amazing! My friend and I will usually get like 3 sides of it! lol. Whatever I order there I ALWAYS have to get a side of this special sauce because it's so dam delicious. =)   Their customer service is actually really good. Their staff is really friendly and helpful and have a lot of knowledge about the menu.   The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I've never tried their dinner menu so I can't really review it. Other than that, I really do enjoy their happy hour and it's actually become one of my favorite happy hour spots. =)

Let me start by saying when you come here get the Hello Kitty martini! Don't ask questions just get it! lol.   I've been here a few times and I really do enjoy coming here. I ALWAYS get the hello kitty martini. The name just speaks for itself. It comes with Pinnacle citrus, Japanese strawberry soda, and fruit infused Sake. Yummy!!! For food, I always get the Gaijin roll. It's like a chimicanga type sushi roll. I know, it sounds weird but it's actually quite tasty. I don't usually do hand rolls, and I've never gotten a philly hand roll before but omg, I loved it!   The only negative thing about this place is it can be a bit pricey during regular hours. However, they do have happy hour everyday from 3-7 and half off ALL drinks on Sundays. The service is also really good. We were always checked on and they're also very knowledgeable about everything.   I need to come back during happy hour and Sundays! =)

My friend wanted to come here for dinner one evening...  To start, we ordered the Mediterranean plate. This was a really good appetizer. But beware because it's hugeeeee!!!! I loved the hummus and the babganoush that it came with. The cheese was good but a bit salty. For the entree we shared the truffled mushroom pizza. This thing was delicious!!!! Like reallyyyyy delicious! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Lol for drinks I ordered the red sangria and my friend got the orange blossom martini. I wasn't too fond of my sangria. I think it could've been a bit sweeter.   I would definitely come back for their pizza. They also have happy hour and reverse happy hour on the weekends that I'd like to check out. It's a really cute little pizza place. Perfect for a date or even dinner with friends. They have a great outdoor patio and it's right on Mill Ave. So good for people watching. =)

My bf and I were in the area and looking for a place to eat on Friday night. We weren't sure what to eat so of course we had to pull up Yelp and of course Yelp saves the day because this place was amazing!   I've never heard of it and neither one of us has ever had Caribbean food before so we wanted to try something new and I'm so glad we did!   He ordered the Rumbi beach burger combination which comes with fries and a drink while I ordered the Island Chicken Jerk sandwich. We always try to order different things at new restaurants so we can both experience something new and see what we like. We're both actually kind of competitive because we like seeing who ordered the better dish lol. And in this case apparently HE won! His burger was so amazingly mouth watering! He said he almost didn't even want to give me his half of it! haha. My sandwich was also good but not as good as his.   Everything was so good at this restaurant. Even the fries and the special sauce that came with it was amazing! Not to mention the price is SOOOOO reasonable. I think the only negative thing I have to say is I wish the location was easier to find. We had to drive around for a while to find it, but it was definitely worth it in the end. =)  The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I'm so glad we found this place on yelp because I will DEFINITELY be coming back. All this talk is making me want to ditch work and go get one right now! Trust me folks, you won't be disappointed. =)

Looks can really be deceiving...  I found this place and wanted to try it out because they seemed like they have REALLY good specials and the pictures looked good. During happy hour a majority of their rolls are 50% off. We ordered the Philly roll, salmon sashimi roll, vegas roll, & I think it was the crunch roll. Everything was mediocre especially for the price that you're paying.   The worst parts? We sat at the sushi bar and there were gnats flying around. No lie! How horrible is that!? 2nd? Customer service was terrible. After we were seated and got our order placed we never saw our waitress again. My friend had to ask for her glass of water maybe 4 times. When someone finally brought it, it wasn't even our waitress but a different one. They never once came by to see how everything was or if we needed anything.   They have good specials and it's very close to my house but I definitely won't be coming back with that type of service.

Love Love LOVE sushi! I've actually been going to this place for a few years now and I love it. There are two things that I absolutely love about it. It's incredibly inexpensive and the sushi comes on a conveyer belt! What more can you ask for. =P  I think that the sushi itself is quite tasty for the price you pay. Each plate is between $1 to $3. Not to mention they have such a variety of sushi to choose from. Not only is the sushi cheap but even the drinks are reasonably priced! You can get a beer or glass of wine for $4. I usually HAVE to come here at least once a month to get my Teharu fix in for the month because I seriously love this place. I'm little so I'm usually full after maybe $3 or $4 worth of sushi. lol. My favorite roll there is the baked scallop roll. It's basically a California roll with baked scallop on top and it comes out nice and warm for you. =)  The staff is also very friendly and helpful. They're very good at bringing you what you need quickly, no doubt about it.   I think one of the  downfalls is if you come in the evening or on the weekends there is a pretty long wait to get seated. Also, if you come during the day or when it is less busy they don't have a big variety of a sushi selection like they would when it was busy. But don't worry, because it is DEFINITELY worth the wait. =)

I'm not really sure how this place only has a 3 & a half star. This place was amazing!!!!  I've stayed at so many hotels in Vegas when I come. Each one is usually just ehh... I found a groupon for this place and it was a really good deal. Even when I saw the pictures I thought it looked really nice. We got an amazing suite with a balcony. I've never even stayed at a hotel with a balcony before.The room comes with 3 tvs. Even one in the bathroom! The bathroom was so beautiful as well. It comes with one of those dual shower heads, one of them was that rainforest shower head thing. There's also a separate tub with jets in there. There's also a sofabed, full stocked kitchen, stove, dishwasher, the works.. The entire room was amazing and the hotel is very modern. I wish it wasn't so cold because I really would've wanted to check out their pool.  This place was great. I pretty much would like to stay here every time I come. lol. The service was amazing and everyone was extremely friendly. We even got a view of the strip for free when we should've gotten charged for it. They also have a free shuttle to take you to the strip, it drops you off at Caesar's Palace. Oh ask for the Asian guy bellhop. I wish I would've remembered his name. =P You definitely wouldn't be disappointed staying here. =)

I wonder how their steak is here but don't EVER come here for happy hour with a big group. No joke.   I came here the other day with a pretty big group for happy hour. The service was horrible, the food and drinks were mediocre. For drinks, I ordered the Orange Slice to start. It was a martini but tasted like a screwdriver with a splash of vodka. My second drink was the Pinot Noir. This one I liked. For food, we ordered the crab cakes, nachos and baked brie. The cheese on the nachos was really dry and didn't taste very fresh to me. I actually liked the baked brie. The cheese and pesto that it came with was really good.   Service.. I've never been a waitress and I understand we were with a big group but I would think you would go around the whole group asking what everyone wanted. Plus there were 2-3 waitresses helping with our group. Never once did that happen. We basically had to flag down the waitress every time we wanted to order something. On top of that, we asked her for the happy hour menu maybe 3 times or more and she never once brought it. We ended up talking to the manager who eventually brought the menu and told him we were very disappointed in the service. We got an apology. I would've thought he could've at least gave us a small discount on the bill, or something complimentary. Anything. Nope. I won't be back for happy hour.

So we came here for dinner and I started off with their Pinot Noir of course which was quite tasty... For our meal we ordered the Mac and cheese with lobster as well as the rib eye. The Mac and cheese was very creamy and delicious. It had a bit of a kick to it. The ribs were superrrrrr tender.   Minus one star for the fact that its hard to locate. There's no huge sign or anything so its easy to miss. Its a really cute place for dinner or a date.

I LOVE happy hour. I mean LOVE. =)  I came here for the first time for happy hour with my sister last week & we weren't really sure what to expect since neither of us have been here. They have happy hour from 4-8 and they have a pretty wide selection of items on the happy hour menu for you.   For food, we ordered the nachos, calamari and fish tacos. I LOVED the calamari. It comes with two types of sauce for you. A red chili sauce which I wasn't too fond of but I loved the chipotle mayonnaise sauce. The nachos were huge! It comes with the works. I mean the works, like everything! We couldn't even finish half of it. If you get the fish taco, get it grilled!   Drinks... I've never had a slushie long island before so I decided to test it out. Um, it was quite different. I think I'll stick to my long islands on the rocks. My sister ordered the spiced arnold palmer which was tasty.   I like how you can sit ANYWHERE for happy hour and that it doesn't end until 8 rather than 6 or 7. Some places you have to sit at a designated area for happy hour and it's first come first serve, which means harder to get a table.   The customer service was extremely friendly and great. The only negative I would say is that it took a bit long to get our food. However, I'll definitely be back for happy hour again! =)

I came here with a friend a few days ago for dinner and drinks. I found it on Yelp of course. =)  I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the chicken tenders and my friend ordered the fish and chips. The chicken tenders were ok. I wish they were a little bit crispier. For drinks I ordered the Fresh Strawberry martini. I loveddddd it. Not only was it well worth the $9 but it was made with fresh strawberries which I loved. My friend ordered the Appletini which was also quite tasty.   I would definitely come back for their drinks. They do have a happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-7 which I'd like to come back for the drinks again and to try their appetizers.The only thing that got me was we got charged for sides of ranch. I ordered chicken tenders so I felt that it should've already come with the meal not be charged extra. The service was really good. Our waitress was really friendly. It's a really good place to just hang out and watch a game for all you sports lovers. =)

A few months ago I bought a Groupon for this place since I thought it was an extremely good deal. $39 for 6 wine tastings, 1 snack plate, and a chocolate dish, not to mention after trying the wine you get to take home a bottle of your favorite choice with  a custom label with your names on it. My boyfriend and I came here this past Saturday for our date and we had an amazing time. The ambiance of the place was great and perfect for a date and the staff was extremely friendly.   It was my first time having a wine tasting venture so I would say it was a good first experience for me. One of our favorites was the Raspberry Pinot Noir which we ended up taking home with us.I think it's a very good place for a date and I would definitely want to come back in the future. =)

Was dyingggggg for a burger during work one day and I found this place on Yelp.   This place is literally down the street from my work so I had to try it out, especially with such good ratings. I ordered the Bacon burger with a side of fries. It wasn't the best burger I ever had but it was pretty good. They have their own special sauce on it as well which is also served with their fries. It actually reminded me of In & Out's sauce. That thousand Island shizz... lol. Their fries are good too. Not too salty or soggy but just right. My co worker ordered the chili cheese fries which I got to try. Holy crap, their portion for this was huge! It was a like a 2 person meal maybe. lol.   The pricing wasn't that bad and the staff was really friendly. Plus I got my meal quick! The only thing was I felt like I needed to hit the gym after scarfing everything down. lol. I'll definitely come back when I'm feenin for a burger since it's so close to my work. =)

Wine bars... What's NOT to love! Especially this one!   I came here with some friends the other night and I already love wine bars so I love trying new ones. I loved everything about this place. From the food, to the wine, to the environment...  I ordered the Chicken Pesto Pasta. This entree was delicious! I like it when they don't skimp on the sauce because I feel that it makes it taste dry. The pesto sauce was really yummy. I'm a pretty light eater and usually always have leftovers to take home, but I devoured it! My friend ordered the Portobello burger that I tried. Quite tasty as well and I like the combination fries and dipping sauce that it came with. I also ordered the Red Sangria which was quite yummy. It wasn't too sweet like most Sangrias that I've had.   Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable as to his recommendations to what was good on the menu.   I loved the lounge area that they have set up as well. You can stay and hang out after you eat. It actually reminded me of the Living Room wine bar in Chandler that I absolutely love. Another great thing is that it's in Old town Scottsdale so it's not that far from me.   They have a happy hour menu as well that I'd really like to come back and try and will probably do an updated review on that as well! If you like wine bars with great food this is definitely the place to go! =)

My friend brought me here for the first time a few years ago and  I've been going here ever since. It's a very nice wine bar/lounge. It's a great place to meet up with friends for a drink and just socialize or even take a date here. The environment is very cozy and the name of the place speaks for itself. You have the option of sitting at one of their tables, the bar, their couches or on the outdoor patio. I love their outdoor patio, especially in the winter time because they have fire places that they turn on for you. They even have live music on certain days of the week as well.  As far as their menu, they have a variety of food that you can choose from. Soups, salads, sandwiches, and plenty desserts. If you do have a chance to come here you HAVE to try the bruschetta. They have 8 different types to choose from and in my opinion they all taste amazing. My favorite has to be the chicken salad or the Apples and Brie. I also LOVE their Chocolate Fondue. It comes with a variety of fruits, pretzels, marshmallows, etc. Very yummy! =)   Now onto the best part, the drinks! They do have a pretty awesome happy hour. $5 for a selection of wines and $2.50 for drafts from 11am-6 pm. I'm more of a wine/martini drinker myself. They have a variety of their specialty martinis but I usually get one of my favorite drinks which is a Cosmopolitan.   I love the atmosphere & environment of this place and would definitely recommend coming here for a date or small social gathering. You can't get any cozier than a place called The Living Room. =)

This was the 2nd nail salon that I went to last night to get a gel manicure done. I showed them the picture of the design that I wanted, however no one at the salon could do it. I then showed my second option and the lady said that she could do it. Needless to say my gel manicure looks nothing like the original picture. (see picture I posted) The lady kept saying that originally the price was supposed to be $35 but she is giving me a discount so it's $32. She must've mentioned it like 3-4 times. I didn't even get my hand massage. I originally came to this place because I looked them up on Yelp and there are very good designs here. It was after 7 by the time we were done so I wasn't going to be a b**** and tell her to re do them, and I have friends and family who do nails so I know how hard they work. Needless to say, I'm pretty disappointed and won't be returning.

My friend and I wanted to go to dinner and she's been talking about this restaurant nonstop. Let's just say it was not what I expected at all.   My friend arrived there before I did. Nobody acknowledged her for about 15 minutes so she ended up seating herself. After I arrived we both actually ordered our drinks and entrees at the same time. She ordered the vegetarian tacos which came with a custom soy sauce. She asked the waiter what were the ingredients which he had no knowledge of and said he would bring it on the side for her. I ordered the chicken tacos and a glass of the Irony Pinor Noir while she ordered a peach ale beer.   First, it took 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. We sat by the bar so we noticed that they were just sitting on the counter for a good 10-15 minutes before we even received them. When he finally brought us our drinks, he apologized and said there was a delay because they ran out of my wine that I ordered. My friend told him that's unlikely since we've seen our glasses on the counter, FILLED for the past 20 minutes.   My friend then wanted to get some tortillas on the side. Our waiter did not come back to our table so she literally walked up to the bar to order her tortillas. Not to mention she never received the custom soy sauce on the side that she requested.   All in all, I was very disappointed. When i go to a restaurant there are two things that I look for . Good food and good customer service. It was a very unfortunate experience for me because I really enjoyed my food and my wine tasted remarkable. Such a disappointment for such a nice establishment with good food!

A New Mexican restaurant in AZ? This made me think of my best friend who lives in NM. =)  I came here with a friend last night for dinner since she's been dying to come here. I think everything deserves a four star. I ordered the Pasta Hedi which was amazingly delicious! It's a pasta that comes with chicken on top of a tortilla. The sauce was sooooo yummy. I'm really into pasta so I really loved it. It also comes with a house salad which I thought was really good and very good size portion. I had to split it with my friend. We washed everything down with margaritas. I ordered the Prickly Pear margarita which definitely satisfied me after a long day..You have to try it!   The service was also very good. Our server always came back to make sure everything was to our liking. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well. It's a great date spot.  The only reason it doesn't get a four star from me is because it's a bit pricey. Between the both of us with our entrees and drinks the bill came out to about $60. That and it's pretty far from me. I wish there was one on my side of town. But you get what you pay for!   I'll definitely be coming back for that pasta and margarita again! Plus their brunch menu also looks beyond yummy and something that I'd like to try out. =)

There's nothing like a good burger!   I've heard so many good things about this place and FINALLY got to check it out this weekend, boy was everyone right about it! It was amazing!   I saw the Breakfast burger and just had to get it. It comes with all of my favorites.. avocado, bacon, mayo and topped with a fried egg! Anything with a fried egg on it is good to me. lol. The burger was amazing and beyond delicious. I also ordered the Creme Brulee Milkshake which was soooooo good! You have to try it! We also ordered the Double Truffle Fries. It was good but it came with this weird Mayo dip which I was not too fond of.   Everything was really amazing, HOWEVER the service... my oh my... Let's just say it was very disappointing... We ordered ranch and ketchup for our fries which never came. We had to flag down another waitress to get it for us. Also, our water cups were pretty much always empty. I almost felt the need to go to the bar just to get more water. =/ The waitress probably checked on us maybe once the entire time we were there.   This place really does have amazingggg burgers! I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't for the poor service. I also wish there was one on my side of town as well but you can't win em all! =0

First of all, I love the fact that they have a dog friendly patio!! So we got to bring our little furbaby with us for brunch!   I ordered the margarita and the smoked turkey crossiant. This was huge and really good. I really liked the pesto aioli that it came with. My margarita was ok. Nothing special.   They also have happy hour every day which is great. 7-11 Monday to Friday and 3-7 everyday. I'll definitely be back!

Worst customer service ever. 30 minute wait for my burger which ended up being burnt. After we waited 30 minutes for our food  we went to ask them the status. The lady rudely told us that the food wasn't ready since we just got here. Good luck ever getting a 5 star. We won't ever be back.

I've heard sooooo many good things about this place and I love me some ice cream so I just had to check it out.   I came here with my sister last weekend for dessert after a lovely dinner. I heard they have Vietnamese coffee ice cream now so OBVIOUSLY I just had to try it. lol. What a good choice! I had half of that mixed with one of my other favorites which is butter pecan. Loved it!   Everyone was extremely friendly and it's such a cute little ice cream shop and everything is actually very reasonably priced. I'm so bummed that there isn't one on my side of town otherwise I'd probably go all the time. I'll definitely be coming back if I'm ever in the area. Need my Vietnamese coffee ice cream! =P

I came here for breakfast with my love & my Oreo aka my puppy. It was a Sunday so it was a bit packed.   I ordered the N counter omelette. This has all of my favorites in it. chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, cream cheese and hollandaise sauce. Everything was amazing, however I wish it came with more of the Hollandaise sauce. I also ordered the Melon Patch cocktail. This wasn't anything amazing to it.   I really like this place a lot. The food is good and I like their outdoor patio and the fact that it's dog friendly so I can take my puppy. They'll even bring out a bowl of water for her. The only negative is I wish it was more restaurant style instead of waiting in line to order at the counter. Great place for breakfast/brunch though.

Worst customer service ever.   I came in and asked how much a polish change was for my previous gel manicure. $15. I showed the guy a picture of what I wanted done. He said, no we can't do that. He said they're stickers. I asked if they could draw it on. He said it wouldn't look like the picture. Then he just straight said we can't do it. That's it. Didn't ask if I wanted something else. Just simply no, we can't do it and was extremely rude about it.  Thanks. I'll be sure to tell everyone I know about my wonderful experience.

This has definitely become one of my favorite spots for an evening of wine!   I've been here a few times and have loved it ever since the first day. There are so many great things about this place. I love the atmosphere and the way the place is set up. When you walk in you can grab a table or sit by the cozy little fireplace that they have. I love their outdoor patio. It's big and they have two fire pits outside to sit by. Another plus is they also have live music there every night I believe.   As far as the food and drinks. I love me some Pinot Noir so I always order the Ramsay which is delicious. For food I've tried a majority of their bruschetta which is really good and have also had their Italian flatbread. They also have a happy hour everyday from 3-6  which I haven't been able to take advantage of yet. Their staff is also really great. Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and they really take care of you.   All in all, it's such a great place to hang out with some friends for some amazing wine or also the perfect date spot. Take your ladies here fellas! They won't be disappointed. =P

Hellooooo Froyoooooo!!!!   I actually don't eat a lot of sweets at all, and if I had a choice between ice cream or froyo I would typically choose ice cream. BUT I was actually in the mood for some froyo this time and of course Yelp saved the day again. I found this place on Yelp and it had such good ratings and reviews that I had to check it out.   When you first walk in everything is very colorful. I think I had an "Ikea" weekend, because this place was also decked out in Ikea furniture and decorations. lol. I loved it though because it felt very friendly and welcoming. I got the coconut and cookies and cream yogurt. They have sooooo many toppings there. The one that stuck out to me was the boba. There was mango and strawberry so I wanted to try it. I was expecting it to be chewy like usual boba is, but it's the kind that explodes in your mouth! lol.   I really liked this place. It was pretty packed here on a Saturday night when we went. I also liked how there's a little fountain right next to it. Makes it feel peaceful. Bonus? It's like 5 minutes from my house! I'll definitely be coming here again soon especially with this amazing weather we've been having. =P

Best... Wings... Ever!!!   The first time I tried this place was at wing stock last year and it was amazing. I'm so glad it's close to my house!! I've tried almost all of their favors and everything is amazing. My favorite is the garlic Parmesan and their atl style. The lemon pepper is also really good. I usually get full after half a dozen. And don't forget to wash it down with some kool aid!!   Everyone is really friendly and the service is pretty quick. They get really packed on the weekends around lunch time though. It's worth the wait though. You won't be disappointed!! =)

Well the start of the evening here was not great at all. We walked in and there was a sign that said wait to be seated. After waiting for ten minutes, no one came to seat us. We wanted to sit on their patio, so went went to their patio which had another sign that said see hostess for seating. Well what's the point of that if there isn't one. After finally just seating ourselves, we waited for a waitress to come by to help us. Another ten minutes go by, then someone finally decides to show up. At this point I was about ready to leave. The waitress asked what we wanted to drink, well we didn't even get menus so we could order.  After finally getting menus and ordering, I ordered a banana cream martini. This was not what I expected at all. It was delicious and extremely strong. I couldn't even tell you what I ordered because the entree is not on their online menu. It was a wrap with turkey, bacon, avocado, tomato, lettuce and a chipotle sauce I believe. (see picture)  All in all, I would probably just come back for their drinks and sit at the bar since that's the only way you'll get seated is when you seat yourself. Note to owners, don't put a sign in the front to be seated if you're not going to have people there to seat your customers.

Nothin like some bbq after a workout huh? lol.   My friend recommended this place and wanted to try it out. So we had no idea what to get. We ended up sharing a 3 meat platter. Which was a bit much for two of us. We didn't even finish it. lol. We ordered the brisket, pulled pork and chicken, with a side of the creamed corn and Mac & Cheese. So my favorite was probably the pulled pork. This thing was amazing. & the sauce that they have will blow you away. Try the hot and sweet sauce that they have! The mac and cheese was also reallyyyyy delicious. I wasn't too fond of the chicken because I thought it was a bit dry.   I definitely want to come back for happy hour! Those bbq nachos look bomb! The customer service was spectacular. I wish I remembered our server's name because he was super friendly and helpful with the menu. Very knowledgeable and always made sure we got everything we needed. I'll be back for more! =)

So I've been to this location and the one in Phoenix off ray and the 10. My friend has a membership here. So we've been gym buddies and trying to encourage each other to go more often. Sometimes u need that extra push to get you there!   If you want something super basic, nothing flashy or fancy then this is the gym for you. It's about $10 a month, or you can do $20 a month for all locations and bring unlimited number of guests.   Now I'm torn between a 2 star and 3 star rating for this place. First, I've been a member with 24 hour for years. Not switching, they're pretty basic as well, nothing fancy, has everything I need for a very reasonably priced. However, my gym has a sauna, basketball court, classes, pool, etc. which Planet does not. The big thing for me was no sauna! what!? AND what is up with that lunk alarm thing? They're supposed to be a judgment free gym supposedly, but then they have this alarm which screams and flashes when someone drops a heavy weight, grunts, or actually exerts effort.  what the!!?? Doesn't really make sense to me. & is that really necessary?

I've been to this sushi spot a few times now to satisfy my sushi cravings... =)  This past Saturday I came here with some friends. One of the best things about them I believe is that I think they have happy hour everyday. They have a certain variety of sushi for happy hour as well as their little mini bombers. I always get my philly roll which is actually not too shabby here because they REALLY fill it with salmon and cream cheese for you where I feel like most places gip you on that. As far as their specialty rolls there weren't a lot of items that really caught my eye. We got that Rice Crispy one which is not bad.   So we saw this one drink on the menu that we just HAD to try. It's called the balls of fury. If you ever come here you HAVE to get it. It's a ginormous drink! It is equivalent to 4 regular drinks so you have to share it with someone. I'm not sure what's in it but it doesn't taste strong at all so it ends up creeping up on you! lol.   All in all, I like this place because it's really close to my house and I like their happy hour menu and drinks. I'd come for happy hour but probably not during regular hours. Or maybe come just for the drinks! =)

My boyfriend wanted to take me to dinner for my birthday and I chose Sochu House! I saw the pictures and it reeled me right in!!  For drinks i ordered the Sweet Karma. This was a lychee martini that was quite tasty. And let me tell you. They do not skimp on the drinks. This was filled to the rim!! For the entree I ordered the crispy island noodles. This comes with chicken, carrots, baby corn, mushroom. The sauce that came with it was really good. We also ordered the fried rice ball. It's exactly like it sounds people. A fried rice ball. Lol.   I really loved this place. They have so many items to choose from for their tapas menu. I definitely want to come back to try more of them. We came on a Monday so it is also $3 off your martini drinks. The best part was the ambience and decor of the place. It's a great place for dinner or they also have a lounge to have drinks at. I will definitely be back!

If I could give this place a zero star I probably would. Why? Horrible, unprofessional customer service..  We originally stopped by here because some of my friends wanted to do Karaoke. First, my friend got cut off after buying a round of shots. When he came up to the bar to get more drinks they told him he was cut off. Um why? Secondly, we were here for about an hour, we all went outside on the patio and a guy comes out on his smoke break, I'm assuming he was the bartender. Looks at me and my girl friend, and says I need to see your ID and yours. First of all, I don't care about getting carded, but why isn't anyone else getting carded. I asked him, why weren't we carded the minute we walked in? He said because they don't have a bouncer. Why would you card us an HOUR later after we've all already ordered drinks. The way he approached us about it was what really got to me.   Needless to say I'll never be back..

It was date night with the bf and I've been wanting to try this place out.   I didn't know what to anticipate and it was not what I expected at all. It was about a 30 minute wait for a table on a Friday night that we went. I ordered the Spam sliders and some Nitro chocolate beer that they had on tap. The sliders were good but very messy. I didn't like my beer since it was too thick for me and tasted a bit bitter.   I was a bit disappointed in this place. First, it wasn't hard to find, however they have a tiny parking lot so you will most likely have to look for street parking. I think that it's great that they have over 31 beers on tap, however they have this huge chalk board that they just write everything on. There's no menu with their beers on there. I already have bad vision so I would have to get up and go up there every time I wanted to look at their menu.  If you sit in the inside it's extremely loud. I couldn't hear anything my boyfriend was saying. Their website doesn't even have their food menu or anything on there so I can't really even describe my meal or explain to you what my boyfriend ordered.   The service was really good. However, I probably wouldn't come for dinner. I'd probably come for maybe a drink on their patio.

I was so disappointed in this place. =/   We came here for my sister's birthday for dinner. I ordered the mushroom risotto. I usually don't eat a lot so I don't even finish my plate. However, their plates here are tiny. I finished almost the entire thing. For $20 a plate you would think it would be a pretty good size plate. The mushrooms were very flavorful. The risotto however was extremely bland and had no flavor whatsoever. My boyfriend ordered the tagliatelle bolognese pasta. Let's just say he left the restaurant still hungry. The sad part is the dish was delicious.   Since we had a huge group, we had two waiters. One on each side of our table. The side across from us got their drinks, food and check way before we did. It took almost 30 minutes for us to get our check after requesting it and to top it off it was incorrect. The only plus for me was was my lemon drop martini that the bartender whipped up that wasn't on the menu. We spent a total of $60 and left hungry. We won't be back.

Happy happy hour!!!!   I pass by this place all the time and have always wanted to try it out. We came here for happy hour and got the works. Food, drinks, u name it. And everything was delicious!  For the food we ordered the verde chicken flatbread and the boneless buffalo wings. Half buffalo and bbq. The bbq ones were really good.   Now onto the good stuff. $5 martinis, $4 wines! 1/2 off appetizers! My first martini was the Tickled Pink. This comes with X-Rated Fusion Liqueur, DeKuyper Peachtree, cranberry and orange juices. Quite tasty I must say. My 2nd martini, and when I saw this on the menu I just had to try it. S'Mores!! This is as amazing as it sounds! & for $5 why not? lol.  The drinks aren't that strong but they are quite tasty. I will definitely be coming back for some more martinis. =)

So they get an extra star from me for 1- they have ranch! 2- it was bomb.com! Most nice pizza places that you go to don't even have ranch, which I don't even know how that's possible if they have salads..  I've been here twice now and have loved both times. We ordered the Manifesto which was delicious! It comes with mushrooms, sausage, goat cheese, red sauce and their fennel. I also ordered their Pinot Noir which was quite tasty.   The customer service was also really good. Water cup was never empty and our waiter really knew his shizz on the menu. I wish there was one on my side of town! I'll be back soon. =)

Another great Sushi happy hour place!! =)  I came here with a friend last week to try out their happy hour. I'm not sure what I love more, happy hour, or sushi. So when you combine it? Doesn't take much to make me happy. lol.   They have happy hour from 3-7. We ordered A LOT! I think I always over order every time I go get sushi. Which is horrible since I'm tiny and don't even eat much. lol. We ordered the Philly roll, Vegas Roll, Dragon Roll, Salmon Nigiri, and so much more. I really liked everything. It was beyond fresh and very reasonably priced for happy hour. I also ordered their Lychee Martini  which was delicious while my friend got some Sake. We ordered about 6-7 rolls plus 2 drinks and it only came out to about $40ish!   They also do the tepanyaki cooking here which reminded me of Benihana. We got there at the perfect timing which was around 5:30ish because it got extremely busy. I thought the service was good and so was the food. I'll definitely be back to get my sushi happy hour fix on! =)

Hellooo to one of my new favorite happy hour places!   I came here with my sister the other day because she said their happy hour was amazing. And boy was she right! I definitely wasn't disappointed!   We ordered 4 different happy hour dishes and they all were sooooo delicious! Sliders, calamari, Mongolian flatbread and Asian Nachos  Sliders-the meat was soooo tender and I think it was what made the burger tasty Calamari-I loved the sauce that it came with. It also came with some type of salad. Not sure what dressing was in that but it's probably some of the best calamari I've ever had. Mongolian flatbread-Also VERY tender meat on it that made it amazing Asian Nachos-Now THIS was different. There was a variety of different ingredients on it and what was different was that it came on won tons. One word. YUMMY!  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is because I haven't gotten a chance to taste their regular menu which is something that I'd like to try next time I'm there. We had good service when we were there, however I have heard that it's not always the best from time to time.   I seriously wish that this place was closer to my home because I would most likely be a regular here. =)

So after trying Guy Fieri we HAD to try out Gordon Ramsay on our last day in Vegas...  This was a really tough choice between the two! Everything was amazing! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger. This comes with avocado, cheese, jalapeno peppers. The burger was just right! To drink I got the skinny screw. It was delicious! You have to get it! They don't have their drinks on a menu. The waiter came with an ipad and pulled up their drinks for us to look at. & if I remember correctly they had 32 different beers to choose from! We also ordered the beer battered onion rings. OMG! They were some of the best onion rings I ever had. They came with a ranch dipping sauce that was so good I wanted to take some home with me!   This was a really tough one for me. Between Guy Fieri and Gordon Ramsay they both had different things that I really enjoyed. I liked my burger at Guy Fieri better and the fact that it came with a variety of fries for no extra charge. However, I loved my drink and onion rings here at Gordon Ramsay. Both very pricey but well worth it. I'll definitely be back to try more items on the menu next time I'm in vegas!

You can't get more secretive than this lounge right here! It is literally a hidden gem!   This cute little lounge is hidden inside of commonwealth. You seriously can't find it when you walk in. First you have to make a reservation. The night of, everything is done through text and you have to text them when you get there. They walk out of a hidden door to greet you and show you the way in.   It is so secretive that I couldn't even take any pictures. Dan is such a great bartender. You basically tell him what type of drink you like and he will create something amazing for you. The drinks are a bit pricey but the experience is well worth it.

This place was great! I really loved the atmosphere, food, customer service, everything!  I came here for lunch with some friends of mine. The first thing that I loved about it was their outdoor patio. You get to sit right next to a little water fountain, plus it was perfect weather. We came for lunch so we ordered the hummus, wasabi cut fries, and a Sonoran burger. Now I'm not a big fan of wasabi so to hear that they had wasabi fries I didn't really know what to expect. Plus I'm a total wuss when it comes to spicy food. But this was really good and it had a kick to it! My burger was perfect and I loved the sauce that it came with.  For drinks, I ordered the Strawberry Basil Crush and my friend ordered a Cosmo. My drink was very refreshing, I loved it! Beware of the Cosmo! It was strong as hell! You definitely get your money's worth with that drink. lol.   Everything was just spectacular here. I can't wait to come back to try the other items and to try out their happy hour as well. =)

After a week long of craving sushi I FINALLY got my fix on at this place! =)  I absolutely loveeeee Sushi and love trying new places...We found this place on Yelp  (obviously...  =P) and what caught my attention was that they have happy hour all day everyday! Oh I'm there!   We ordered so many amazing rolls and everything came out on  this cute little boat. We got the Philly roll, Rainbow roll, Salmon Roll, this salmon garlic roll and much more...Everything was so delicious and fresh! For their happy hour menu they have a variety of rolls that range from $3-7. Also, they have their house wine which is not bad, for $5, Sake Bombs for $5 and small Hot Sake for $3.   Everything was sooooo yummy and you really can't beat happy hour all day everyday. Not to mention the customer service was great! Everyone was extremely friendly and funny and we even got some ice cream from them at the end. =) & of course all of the great food places are on the opposite side of town from me. I will DEFINITELY be back to get my sushi fix on though! =)

Ohhhh myyyy goshhhh I LOVED this place! =)  So my friend wanted to go to dinner one lovely evening. I found this place on Yelp and it sounded really good. For the entree I ordered the Baked Artisan Goat Cheese Crepes. This thing was freaking amazinggggg... So good! It came with spinach, herb grilled wild mushrooms, roasted bell pepper sauce, and watercress salad. The special sauce that was on it was really good as well. For drinks, you HAVE to get the Bunny Slope. I saw a picture of it on Yelp and just had to try it. It comes with Vodka, Strawberry Cream Infusion, White Chocolate Liqueur. You wouldn't think it was that strong since it's on the thicker side but it was! So dam yummy!   Not only was the food amazing but the service was spectacular. This place has only been open for a little over a year but I really enjoyed it. My only recommendation is maybe they need a little more decor in the place. The walls felt a little bit of plain jane. I will DEFINITELY be coming back for dinner, AND they have a happy hour that they will most likely see me at in the near future. =)

I'm very torn between giving this place a 3 star or a 4 star. =/  The first time I came here was for a Yelp event Lindsey put together last year. It was amazing and everything was perfect. So my friend wanted to go to dinner, and I wanted to find a place that had happy hour on Sundays. This place has happy hour every day from 4-7. Perfect right?  They also have live music after 8 pm on Sundays too. Plus I've been here before and after such a good experience, sold!   So for drinks, I wanted the Canteloupe Tini, it was amazing the first time. They didn't have it! What!? First fail. =/ So I got a Cosmo. Definitely got my money's worth on that. Ok for food, they had the house made pasta on the list. They didn't have it! What!? That's two for two. So I ordered the Funghi pizza. This comes with mushrooms, mozarella, tomato sauce, pecorino - herbs. Our waiter, (Tony) suggested I added duck to it. And it tasted amazing.   I'm torn between the 3 or 4 star because how can you not have both of these items on the menu? But, Tony our server was amazing. He was so knowledgeable of everything on the menu. & I pretty much ordered everything he suggested. You're getting a 4 star Evo. Thank Tony! =P

I came here with some friends for happy hour this past weekend. Loved it!!!  They have happy hour 3-6:30pm everyday and also certain drink specials that run everyday. For drinks I got a Mojito. It was ok. I've been drinking all day so I wanted something on the lighter side. For food we got the sampler which comes with the hummus nachos, caprese salad, salut fries, and prosciutto wrapped melon. The hummus nachos were amazinggggg!!! I wanted to keep getting more! There were three of us so it didn't fill us enough so we ended up also ordering the Paquillo Ravioli with shrimp. I really loved the sauce that they had on this. I thought that the entree was a bit small, especially for $17.   The service was really great here. The place has only been open for about a year but everyone was really friendly and accommodating. When we ordered the pasta they forgot the shrimp so they brought it out on the side after and took it off our bill. At the end, they forgot to bring us our check so my friend went to the bar to ask them for it. The manager came over and apologized and ended up giving us free shots to make up for it! Wow. I don't know about you guys but I don't know a restaurant that would give you free shots for that. I eventually want to come back to try their brunch and they also have bottomless mimosas on Sunday! I'll definitely be back for happy hour or brunch soon. Not to mention the workers are not bad to look at.FYI ladies.. =P

I'm alwayssssss up for trying new sushi! Especially if it's inexpensive and revolving! =)  We had bought a Groupon for this place and it's actually right down the street from my house so we wanted to try it out. I guess I kind of went in with high expectations since my other favorite revolving sushi place is Teharu and I absolutely love them...  I felt like the food portions were sooooo tiny... I felt like they did this on purpose so you keep getting more and more sushi. Not only that but the sushi just didn't taste fresh. I think it was just straight bland. There were a few rolls that had such a strange combination. For example, there was a roll that had peanuts with avocado. No bueno! Then you had your tempura mixed with bananas. lol. I see that they're trying to make their rolls creative but I can't see peanuts, rice and avocado being a good mix.   The only good thing I would say is that the staff was extremely friendly. At the end though we didn't reach our limit on our Groupon and it took them what felt like forever to figure it out. I most likely won't be coming back here to get my sushi fix on. =/

My friend is a huge pizza lover and this is one of her favorite places that she wanted to take me and I see why!! Everything was amazing.   I ordered the  Capricciosa pizza. This comes with Prosciutto Cotto, Gaeta Olives, Artichoke, and  Mushroom. I loved it! Everything was amazing except I wasn't a big fan of the olives. I washed it down with the Pinot Noir wine which was delicious.   Not only was the pizza delicious but what makes the place is the customer service. Maurizio did such a great job. He always made sure that we got everything we needed and was so friendly and funny! Ask for him when you come here!   So you got good food, good drinks and good customer service right? What else can top that? How about the owner coming around with free shots that he made! Um what!? What restaurant do you know that comes around your table giving you free shots!!?? Not to mention we also got free desert! This place was such a cute little spot for a date or even with friends for a great night of pizza and wine. =)

So I was basically in dessert heaven the minute I walked through the door. =) Goodness what a great event!   When you first walk in you're already greeted with 4 different types of Gelato to try. I really the regular Greek yogurt and the mint chocolate chip one. Once you go further in, holy crud... talk about desserts beyond desserts! There was everything from cupcakes, to cakes, cookies, muffins, etc.   I think my favorite was this tres leches cake thing. It was so amazing and it wasn't too sweet. There was also an apricot cake that was also quite delicious and tasty. I also tried the cookies which were spectacular and one of the things I really liked was the giant English muffin! It was so soft and warm and tasty. =) Plus there's nothing like washing it down with the sparkling champagne that they had. I swear, my glass was always filled. lol. =)   Also to add to the event was the first Yelp proposal! Congrats to the happy couple!   Everything was so delicious that I was literally in a sugar coma afterwards. As usual, Lindsey did an amazing job putting everything together. Great thanks to Lindsey and LGO for putting this together and having us! =)

I think New Mexican food is amazing in so many ways. I got hooked when I used to go visit the BFF in NM.   This place is definitely on point w/ that! This place is really close to my house and I always pass it so my friend and I decided to try it out. For drinks we ordered the Sangrita that our waitress recommended. I love Sangria, I love Margaritas, so I'm already sold! & It was delicious! For the entree I ordered the Blue Corn Enchiladas. Oh my gosh... get this when you come! I got it with shredded chicken and it is topped with a fried egg. & of course I have to get the Christmas sauce. Sooooo good!!   I really loved this place. Our waitress was so helpful with her recommendations and extremely friendly. Not to mention the food was amazing. I'll definitely be coming back for those enchiladas. But I also want to try their happy hour as well as their margaritas since they are known for their tequila as well. & you can get flights of their margaritas! =)

The love and I came here for dinner one evening. It's basically down the street from my house.  Score!   I wish I would've written this review earlier so I can remember all the little details. I think they're known for their mac and cheese because they have 6 different mac and cheese dishes but I ended up ordering  the fish sandwich since I couldn't eat meat this day. The beer battered fish that came in the sandwich was huge! It was bigger than the actual sandwich! It was quite tasty. I also got a side of the mac and cheese (without meat of course) which was reallyyyyy good. The only downfall was the sandwich was soooo messy! Everything came apart. When I told the waiter he said it's better to order the fish and chips. It's basically the same exact thing and less messy. & you can order bread with it if you really wanted to.   They had live music when we came and it was extremely loud so we ended up sitting on their patio. The waiter was great and was very attentive. He always made sure we had everything we needed. They also have different specials each day of the week too. I'll definitely be back to try their other mac and cheese dishes!!

I'm not sure how this place got a 4 star. I'm very picky when it comes to pho. Maybe that's the Viet in me or the fact that nothing compares to my mom's pho.   This place has horrible service. Which is unfortunate since the food is pretty decent. It took us 20+ minutes just to get some water and menus. When we got our menus they wanted to take our orders right away, on the spot. Um can I look at my menu first?   I ordered the rice with BBQ pork. So com suon nuong. Yummy. My family ordered pho. By the time they got their dishes I was already done with mine. My Thai tea had more ice in it than actual Thai tea. If it wasn't for my family I'd never come back here.

It was my friend's choice for dinner one lovely evening...  So to start, of course I had to order wine to go with my pizza. I got the Picket Fence Pinot Noir. This was quite tasty. I ordered the Calabrese pizza. This comes with mozzarella, Tallegio, Parmesan, caramelized onions, sausage, chilies, basil and olive oil. I loved it! I added prosciutto to it, but I think they forgot to put it on. =/  I always think it's really odd when pizza places don't have ranch. I always mention this because I love ranch w/ my pizza. & what do they serve with their salads then? Since they didn't have ranch, the owner brought us this creamy Gorgonzola sauce. I'm not sure what's in it, but ask them for it! He even offered to whip something else up if I didn't like it.   The best part besides the food was the owner always came out to make sure we had everything we needed and even introduced himself. I call that very good customer service. They would get a five star from me if they had ranch. Also, it was a bit hard to find, because all the signs in that shopping center are the same color so it blends in. The place was a bit small but cozy. Good for dinner with a friend or a date. They have a happy hour! I'll be back for that!

Living in Phoenix it's extremely hard to find an amazing sushi place. Until now!   First, this is the first place I've ever been to where the rice is purple! I came for the first time with my friend and every roll I got was amazing. I wish they had a website because I couldn't remember what was exactly in my rolls. My favorite was the H3 roll and the Oh my gosh roll. You will definitely like this one. The name speaks for itself. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. My friend was also friends with one of the chefs so he let us try some rolls he made. Everything was so fresh! I brought home the leftovers and they still tasted yummy the next day. I wish I could come here everyday!

First, the location on the map is completely wrong. It is on Gilbert and Warner right by life time fitness.  I had to switch doctors because my old doctor didn't accept my new insurance carrier. I found this place and they verified all my information when booking the appointment for me.  I came in 30 minutes early to fill out my paperwork since I'm a new patient. After the nurse calling me in, taking my vitals, and seating me for the doctor to come in, they decide to call me back to the reception to let me know that they don't accept my insurance. First of all, why would you even book the appointment and schedule me in then? Second of all, why isn't your staff 100&% sure before even scheduling these appointments. I wasted an hour of my morning, was late for work and now have to do research to find another doctor.   Note to staff, be 100% sure before even booking appointments and wasting our time.

Yay to another great Yelp Elite event folks!   After checking in, we got to do this activity that Lindsey put together. What a great way to get to know your fellow yelpers as well as new Yelpers! It was so much fun trying to get bingo and getting to know my Yelpers! =)  The food! I tried to so many items but my favorite had to be the nachos and the mushrooms. The nachos were amazing! I devoured that. lol. & the mushrooms had a kick to it at the end. As far as the drinks, the rum punch had to be the highlight of the night! Not only does it come in a mason jar for you but it tastes amazing! I also got to try the apple martini as well as the Merlot which was not too shabby.   Even though this was a bit of a drive for me it was well worth it to get to know my fellow yelpers, meet new yelpers and try out some amazing food and drinks! Thank you to Lindsey and Outback! =)

I loved this place!!! I don't give many places 5 stars but here it is!   I came here with my work crew, because one of my co workers was leaving the company. My bosses reserved the Captain's Room. Ok, if you ever have a group of 10 or more, reserve this room! It's great! It's your own private room, with a dining room table, lounge area, two tvs, fireplace, and pool table. The best part about this restaurant is that it is right on the lake so you have a beautiful view while you eat here. The outdoor patio is also very nice. They laid down some grass and have some tables out there as well as corn hole, and darts for you to play.   Food & drinks.. They have happy hour from 3-6 I believe. We ended up ordering the nachos, coconut shrimp, green chile cheese fries. My favorite was probably the cheese fries. There's a kick to it but it's really good. For drinks, my bosses spoil us. We ordered 4 bottles of wine! I'm a red wine drinker and my favorite is Pinot Noir. It was really good as well as the Cabernet that they had.   This place is really new so I don't think many people know about it. I think the inside needs some more interior designing and they need a huge sign outside that says The Watershed on it. Also, I would recommend extending the happy hour menu to 7 instead. The service was amazing as well. I need to start taking down servers' names when I go out because I never remember and ours was great! He was extremely friendly and very helpful with our group. I'll definitely be back soon! =)

We definitely picked a good choice when we picked this restaurant!   I just had to see what all the hype was about. To start I ordered the Guido's Freaky Tiki. A delicious cocktail that included everything in it. 2 different types of rum, passion fruit, pineapple juice, orange juice lime juice, grenadine.   For the entree my friend recommended the bacon mac and cheese burger. Omg, it was amazing and I was definitely in heaven eating this thing. Seriously imagine a huge burger with mac and cheese in it. One of the best parts was the burgers come with fries. No extra charge! & not just fries but a variety. Truffle fries, onion rings, and regular fries, so you get to try a little bit of everything. Genius! What's not to love! Everything was really pricy here but you get what you pay for! & it was definitely well worth it. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas. =)

This event was a bad idea! Why? Because now I want a puppy more than ever!!!! lol.   I've always wanted a puppy for years now, but have just never gotten one or I just can't decide on one. There were so many cute dogs here last night! Well we started off the night by signing in and I got to take home a Yelp Elite watch! Woo Hoo! I'll definitely be rocking that thing all the time. There was a cute little doggie station where you could've pampered your dogs and spoiled them with some amazing treats.   The food was delicious! I really enjoyed the Filet Mignon. It was beyond tender and perfect. The red wine that we washed everything down with went perfectly with it. & For dessert? What's better than Sprinkles cupcakes! Gosh us Elites are just spoiled. =P  The artwork.. everything was beyond beautiful. It was so much fun getting to check out all the amazing artwork with my fellow Yelpers. What a great night!  Thank you so much Lindsey for another amazing event! =)

I found this place on yelp and I'm always up for trying new breweries but ended up being disappointed.   For entrees I ordered the green chili Mac and cheese and added machata to it. Which is a shredded typed of beef. It was a bit spicy but good. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada tacos and these were extremely disappointing for $11. The two tacos were only a little bigger than mini tacos. It came with rice and beans that came in those sauce cups that you use to put your salsa in. That's it?   For beer I ordered their Christmas ale. It tasted really good in the beginning but I'm a slow drinker. After a while it got really flat and tasted really bitter. I was disappointed that they had such a small selection of beers for a brewery. The only plus for me was our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable of their beers.

We saw the event on Yelp and wanted to check out the Grand opening..  It was extremelyyyyyy packed..It was hard to even find a seat because it was so busy. We ended up finding one, and I'm not sure if there were even waiters or waitresses because no one ever came to help us. We ended up finding seats at the bar and sat there. So I originally wanted to try their mac and cheese. & guess what, they were out.. Bummer. I ended up getting the Caprese. This has chicken, mozzarella, tomato, basil. Let's just say I liked their fries more than the entree. I think the truffle fries were the only good thing here.   My boyfriend ordered the union grilled steak burger. This thing was smothered in bbq sauce. & they made it way too hot because he burned his hand when the sauce dripped.   It was extremely loud and packed when we went. I couldn't hear anything anyone said. The only highlight was getting to see some of my Yelper friends there. I won't be back.

Wine, wine, and more wine! How can you not love a wine tasting event!!!  I was so excited about getting into this event since I love wine! Capital Grille is fancy! lol. We got to try 6 different wines that were paired up with little light bites. We started off with the white wines. I'm more of a red wine person but  I really liked the Riesling wine for this one. It was the sweeter one out of the three. However, as far as the food, I lovedddddd the scallops! For the red wines, my favorite type of red wine is Pinot Noir. & theirs was amazing!!!! For the food, my favorite was the Filet Mignon. It was just perfect and melts in your mouth. Yum! lol.   Not only did we get spoiled with wine, but we got some Yelp goodies to take home with us! So much fun with my fellow Elites! Thank you so much Lindsey for another great event as always and thank you to Capital Grille for having us!!! =)

They seriously do not joke around at this bar with their drinks!!   I found this place on yelp and definitely wanted to check it out. I love a good martini!! I didn't think the drinks would be strong since their chocolate Martinis. But the guy even warned us before we even ordered. Lol. I can't remember the name of my drink but it was clear!!! It tasted delicious but I only got through half before tapping out. Let's just say I was definitely feeling good by the end of the night.   I would definitely come back for a good, strong chocolate martini!

This was a fancy little Italian place!   I came here with my friend for dinner. I ordered the Tartufo di Norcia pizza. It comes with Mozzarella di bufala, ricotta, Italian parma ham, mushroom-truffle ragu. I think the best part was the mushroom truffle. It tasted delicious.  So I usually like sweeter red wines so I always order a Pinot noir. I wanted to see what our waiter recommended and he actually recommended one called Nero. This was actually a Cabernet. I was actually surprised of the sweeter taste to it. It tasted amazing with my pizza.   Everything was just on point. They have a happy hour too that I'd like to try. So I'll definitely be back for dinner or happy hour. Fellas its a great place to take that special lady for a date. =)

I absolutely loveeee Zinburger!!!!! I went for the first time a few years ago at the Phoenix location and I loved it.     The first time I went I ordered the breakfast burger. This comes with avocado, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and the best part? A fried egg on top! It was delicious!!! This time I ordered the Blanco burger. This comes with avocado, pico de gallo, cheese, and a chipotle mayo. This one was also to die for! I washed everything down with a watermelon mojito that was very refreshing. And don't forget to get their fries! They're huge enough to share and they have a few options that will not disappoint you. My bf and I shared the truffle fries. The truffle sauce that comes with it was just icing on the cake. If you get a chance try their shakes too. I got the salted caramel shake one time and it was one of the best shakes I've had.   I really believe that everything is delicious on their menu so you won't be disappointed. It was a beautiful day to sit outside on their nice patio which also have heat warmers and the service was spectacular. I'll be back!!! =)

This is a really cute little date spot!   I came here for dinner with a one of my pretty ladies one evening. I ordered the Chinese Ribs, My friend got the southern fried chicken. We also ordered a side of fries to share. Everything was amazing! I really liked the ribs and the seasoning they had on it. The chicken was nice and crispy. I asked for a side of ranch for the fries, and they brought me this siracha ranch sauce which was really good!  I ordered the The cure cocktail, which I wasn't too fond of. My friend ordered the refresher which she thought was a bit strong.   Everything was great, and our server was so hilarious and friendly. I'm just not too fond of their drink menu, and I think their dinner menu has a small selection. However, I would come back though. =)

I came here for a late dinner with the love. I haven't been over here since it used to be iguana macks.   To start I ordered the peachitini. The martini was delicious and very tasteful. For dinner I was very torn between the Mac and cheese and their pizza. I ended up ordering the Mac and cheese and added chicken to it. This was extremely delicious and very cheesy. They did a really good job on it. The only downside was it was extremely spicy for me! I don't remember it saying spicy on the menu so I wasn't warned about this. Lol. It's one of those things where you want to keep eating it though because it was so good.   Another plus is you get a glass of beer that is included as a side when you get an entree. Very good idea social box.   The customer service was really good. The only thing I recommend is dimming the lights a little but. It was extremely bright in the restaurant. I definitely want to come back to try their brick oven pizzas!!

This place is like another version of Smashburger. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. Lol. However, the minute you walk in you feel like you're in a Smashburger.   I ordered the cinco burger. This was a very good size and comes with lettuce, tomato, guacamole, salsa, jalapeños, cheese, and cilantro cream. Everything was great except the jalapeños killed me!! We also got fries with our order. They were good. Nothing special.   I think they're just as good as Smashburger. I love that they have a dipping station though. Get as much sauce as you want everyone! Not to mention the customer service was great.

I bookmarked this place and have really been wanting to try it. Last time I was here it was only called Pearl and was completely different.   I loved it! I ordered the Rice Krispy roll. If I remember correctly, it comes with cream cheese, avocado, eel sauce, and salmon I believe. For drinks, I ordered the Hibiscus Cosmo. It comes with vodka, sake, and a hibiscus syrup that makes it very flavorful.   The best thing about this place was the ambiance. You walk in and you get the elegant, classy feel to it. The way they have it set up, there's a piano right in the middle,  and tables all around the room. The guy who played the piano was amazing. It's such a great date spot AND they also have happy hour! Our waiter was great, sociable, friendly and very knowledgeable. I'll definitely be back!

I love this place! They have the BEST happy hour! Everyday!   The first time I went to Sir Veza's was in the Tucson location and it was just the worst experience ever. I've also been to the one at the Phoenix airport to grab a drink from time to time. So when this location opened I was hesitant to try it out and I'm so glad I did anyway!  I've tried so many items on their menu!  The sonoran dog is really good. It's a bacon wrapped hot dog, with beans, salsa, tomato, and it comes with fries. I've also had their Johnny Vegas which is really good. The cilantro cream cheese that comes with it is delicious. Now if you ever order their burrito bowls, make sure you are REALLY hungry because this thing is huge! I got the Go Shaker Chimi and couldn't even eat half of it.   Their margaritas are also really good! and are usually on happy hour. I recommend the strawberry one on the rocks, Get the 14 bomb!   The customer service has always been good. I love their outdoor patio. It is also dog friendly. (I've taken my little monster with me) And it even has a photobooth! What more can you ask for!

I'm so glad they opened one in Tempe!  Came here for brunch and everything was perfect. The weather was nice, we got a seat on their lovely patio..   I ordered the 3 eggs omelette. Onions, ham and mushrooms for me. I should've put some sort of their sauce on it. However, it was delicious either way. I can't believe they have a caramel apple mimosa! Um what!? It was sweet and delicious and tasted like a caramel apple.   Everything was great, and the service was good. It took about 30 minutes for us to get a table though, and they don't take reservations.

I've been wanting to try this place out so we came here for lunch on a Sunday. It was about a 20-30 minute wait for a table. We sat outside on their lovely patio listening to the live music that was playing.   I ordered the watermelon mule to start. This was a very refreshing drink, but not very strong.Watermelon, ginger beer and vodka. I then ordered the Rose Sangria. Now this was delicious and definitely hit the spot. I ordered the burrata for my entree. This comes with grilled bread, prosciutto, fig, pistachio, roquette, and truffel oil. Also very delicious.   I really liked this place. I love their outdoor patio and the atmosphere. I just thought that their brunch menu was pretty small and our waitress wasn't very talkative. I'd come back though.

The lover loves breweries and really wanted to try this place out so we came by one lovely evening.   We came during the week in the evening so there was no wait and we got seated right away. I absolutely loved everything about this place. The food is good, they have a very big menu, the beer is good, good customer service and a big patio that is dog friendly. I ordered the Mac and cheese and it was absolutely delicious. Super cheesy, just the way it should be.   I love that they are dog friendly because that means we can bring our little brat. Our waiter was new, but he was extremely knowledgable and attentive. We'll definitely be back!!

I'm usually extremely picky on who does my nails or pedicures, however I absolutely loved this place!   I came in for a pedicure and got seated right away on a Saturday afternoon. It's about $18 for a spa pedicure which I would say is very reasonably priced. I wanted my toes to match my nails and the girl who did my designs did an amazing job! Everyone was really friendly and to top it off, it's down the street from my house! I'll definitely be back for another pedicure soon!

Christine is absolutely amazing! I've known her for what feels like forever and she's been doing my nails for the past few years and I have never been disappointed. They always come out exactly how I want them or better! It's hard for me to come to her salon because it's extremely far for me, but when I do, it's worth it.  So I went to two different salons within the past two days and my nails turned out horrible. (See picture). I came to Christine's salon and she did her magic. (See picture) I absolutely love them. I'm not sure where her artistic skills came from, but they're amazing!

Worst experience ever here. For a new place that just opened you would think they would've been more organized.   When we pulled up to the drive thru I wasn't sure what I wanted so I told the guy to give us a minute. He then must've asked me five or six times what I wanted to order. Didn't I just say to give us a minute? So here is our exact order. 2 orders of the two piece dinner meal. One order with cole slaw and an extra side of Mac and cheese. Also wanted both of them to be legs. Both of them must be mild.    We pulled up to the window to pay and get our order. Didn't even get a thank you. When we got home the order was completely wrong. I didn't get two legs like I specified, they forgot my Mac and cheese, and our chicken was spicy. After 5-6 phone calls to the number that was on the receipt, and someone actually answering, they told us that they have new staff. They are only getting two stars from me because they would give us the same order for free. Note to staff, maybe you should check the order before actually giving it to your customer.

Worst experience ever here. We sat at the bar and ordered our drinks from Brandon. The minute we sat down, the girl who sat next to me was telling her boyfriend that I kept bumping into her. Which was untrue because you could've fit another person in between us. I was nice and apologized to her anyway. Then I heard her say it again, when I was once again no where near her. I told my best friend who ended up having a chat with this girl about her false accusations. She then tattles on us to Brandon who then basically tells me to shut it, and he doesn't want to hear about this or we're getting kicked out. My best friend's husband sat on the other side of me and had no idea what was going on and asked me. So while I was in the middle of explaining what happened. Brandon then yells at me again that he doesn't want to hear this bs or we're getting kicked out. I simply stated that my friend asked me what happened so I'm explaining it to him. Brandon then said again that we'll be kicked out if he hears this again.   All in all, I've never had such a rude bartender ever.i have a complete stranger accusing me of bumping into her, and a bartender yelling at me for nothing that I did wrong.  He's supposed to be pouring drinks not being a bouncer. We should've talked to the manager. But we will never return after this experience, and I'll be sure to tell everyone I know not to come here either after that disrespect.
