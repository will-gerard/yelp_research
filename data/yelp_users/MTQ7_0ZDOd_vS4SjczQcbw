When I heard about Earl's, I kept picturing a nice gourmet sit-down restaurant that lavishly only sold handsome sandwiches.  Little did I know that it was just another Subway style sandwich place--with darker interior and more sit-down areas.  Don't get me wrong though their sandwiches were super well made, actually no they were super well done with the warming up process.  I really want to try the sandwich non-warmed up to see if there is a difference with the taste and texture.    I ordered The Earl and the Hawaii BBQ Chicken which I both highly recommend.  Other people went more extravagant with their choices, such as the Full Montagu but I personally wanted to see if their basic sandwiches were even stellar.    The location of Earl of Sandwich is incredibly convenient and I couldn't have asked for a better location.  Smack middle-ish on the Strip and very near the entrance of Planet Hollywood. The fact that it's opened 24 hours a day makes this place even more golden.

I went with 4 of my friends so luckily I had the opportunity of trying a lot of different things at once.  (I highly recommend doing this, especially at a place like Holsteins where their menus are endless)   For milkshakes, we were able to try the basic Strawberry and the alcohol infused Grasshopper.  I would definitely recommend trying at least one of the specialty alcohol milkshake.  The Grasshopper was definitely a hit among my friends.  Unfortunately for those who love tasting the danger in drinks, the alcohol amount is very light and you'll enjoy the unique mixture of sweet tastes rather than the intoxication.    Like how the past reviewers mentioned, the burgers are a bit on the expensive side.  Each burger meal does come with a pint size-like bucket of fries but it's not worth puffing your stomach if you're planning to squeeze into a dress 2 hours later.   I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly Bun under their "Tiny Buns" section.  Loved it.  Go for any appetizer items for your meal.  The size was more than enough.  My friends were eyeing my meal the most and I was the only one without a burger.    With burgers, the "Rising Sun" is a must.  Kobe beef drizzled with nori furikake and crispy yam in between? Yeah you want that.

My friends loved this place. Yelp loved this place.  Veteran Vegas Visitors loved this place.  Because of everyone's hyped reviews about Wicked Spoon of course I kind of had to have a well deserved positive expectation about this place.  Wow. Not even close.   First, I would say something about the over-priced buffet entry cost but then again there is no such thing as a super cheap buffet deal in nice Vegas hotels.  So yes, it is of course overpriced--way too overpriced for its worth.  Second, if you are not an avid seafood lover-- I'm talking about crabs, lobster legs, shrimp cocktail, then this is not the buffet for you.  I noticed in everyone's plates around us that the seafood was what people dived in for.  Third, I want to remember the other ethnic plates that they had but I can't. Maybe I don't want to.  The dessert selection is similar to most other dessert sections in other buffets.  Finally, I will let you know in my other reviews what a great Vegas buffet is about and which one it is.  That excites me.

Wow I cannot imagine this place when a well-known DJ (which is almost every other week) is playing at the Nightclub here.  This place is packed and packed and PACKED. The lines to get into the club are ridiculous--to be more specific, it's the line for those who have contacted promoters in advance.  Which means there is barely a chance for those who are not on the Guest-list to even make it inside. Sorry about it.   One of my favorite moment was the elevator to get to the club after going through security.  They totally make you feel welcome and the bouncer completely turns the light grumpy light off and gets ready to party on with us as we enter the club level.    This place is a little bit confusing to get around if you have already pre-partied before this or starting to get intoxicated from the moment you enter the place.  There initially are a lot of different areas to dance in, but depending on the crowd mass some dance areas might just turn into standing around area.    Outdoors is great because the view of seeing the Strip was gorgeous AND there are couches to rest in! This is quite rare!   Finally, to exit this place I felt like I was walking into a Cosmopolitan hotel room...very discreet and smooth getaway, loved it.

New Serenity exceeded my expectations. From the outside it may not look like the grandiose luxurious spa entrance that many Scottsdale resort spas boast about, but this place most certainly delivers. The waiting area is warm, welcoming, and neatly decorated with fruit infused water refreshments and chocolates. Registration procedure is very typical with the usual paper work to fill out. Front desk attendants carefully explain what will happen next afterwards.   My friend and I barely waited another 3 minutes until we were greeted by our estheticians in the waiting room (very glad they were timely, as spa treatments are costly timed procedures). We both went in for the Serenity Facial. The facial treatments on top of the partial massages are definitely worth the Serenity Facial price. My esthetician also briefly described what she was going to do right before, and I found this very helpful and comfortable. Another plus that they used Eminence products for all facial products.   I did not want to smile or form any facial expressions afterwards. The entire process was extremely relaxing and my face felt very pure and wholesome. I will most certainly come back if I visit Phoenix again.
