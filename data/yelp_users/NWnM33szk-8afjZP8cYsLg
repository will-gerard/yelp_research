Update: after being a client for years I stopped going to the brow lady over a year ago. They stopped using quality products and my lashes were falling out.  The worst part was they did nothing to try and keep my business. I guess they don't care about loyal customers :(

This was my second trip to the secret garden.  I have many allergies including a gluten allergy. They have many items listed on the menu as GF options and are located in my neighborhood so I thought it would be a nice treat.  On my first visit in June 2013 I ordered a GF salad and it came out with bread. I told the waiter and after questioning me about my allergy (acting like i was lying) he said it should be listed as request gluten free. The rest of our experience was enjoyable, nice location, yummy appetizers and wine.  This weekend we decided to go back and give it another try. This experience was less than enjoyable.  It took at least 15 mins for our drinks to come out, then the server dumped my boyfriends beer on his plate "sorry, thought the bottle was empty"  after that we were never asked if we wanted another drink during the wait or the meal.  When I ordered my salad this time I made sure I requested gluten free. After waiting 45 mins for our meals, my salad again came out with bread on the plate, i waited for the waitress for 5 mins to come check on us so i could ask for a new meal. i finally got up to go find her and asked for a new meal. i was told "just dont eat the bread" I again asked for a new meal and I know i was not given a new meal because i have been sick all weekend, my body doesnt lie.  I am completely disappointed and annoyed at servers not taking food allergies seriously. I am a server also and it is not the end of the world if someone has allergies, work with them and make them happy. It is not my fault I have food allergies, i should be able to enjoy a meal out and why do some people think they can judge that?!   House at secret garden... You CANNOT mark a meal as gluten free unless is 100% gluten free...get a clue!!!!

I love my lashes! My lashes had been hurting from a bad aesthetician and I found Lash Out and I decided to try them out and I am so happy that I did. I saw Alli 2 weeks ago and she removed as many of the bad/hurting lashes as she could and then redid the extensions. They looked good and felt great! I went in for another fill today and I am very happy. Alli did a wonderful job on my fill. My eyes look and feel great!!
