Good , authentic mexican.  Had the 3 carne-asada street style tacos plate with rice and beans. Very generous portions and could not even finish my food. Meat was tender and hot off the grill. Added guac, pico, lettuce and lemon squeezed over the whole thing, simple delicious. They beans and Spanish rice are some of the best I've had anywhere, ever. They also have negro modelo on tap. Overall very solid and would eat here again, good service, nice non-tourist trap atmosphere.

Horrible. The seats are dangerously small and lack room in front of them. I am 6'2 and I have bruises on both knees from having to wedge my knees into the back of the seats in front of me for Aziz Ansari. The entire two hours was miserable. Please please renovate the seating.

Went here with the family for dinner, even though it was the first friday of lent they got us in pretty quick. The combos appetiser was on the small side but our salads were fresh and everything came quickly. Food was pretty good, good prices for seafood, seafood jambalaya was yummy. Would come again as a alternate to red lobster.

Terrible service,rude staff, rude manager...will never,ever give kona grill my business. Waited over an hour for a table at happy hour, informed all staff we were waiting for table. Watched multiple times as other people stole tables that opened up. Staff and manager did not care and were rude.

No idea why this place is rated so low, but here is my 2 cents after multiple visits to this cheap, delicious hole-in-the-wall.  Their food is very good, much better than most fast-mexican type places like this, and their prices are cheap, like a 1.25 for a street-style taco.  Carne Asada, Al Pastor, Carnitas, Lengua all excellent, and they do small street-style tacos right, cheap and fresh.  Also had their torta, which was great. It's notable they also have more seafood than most fast mexican places.  Soccer usually on the big screen in the dining room is simply awesome too.  For the price and quality of food this is one of the best places in the area, try a few taco's and see for yourself....

Been coming here for many, many years with the family for delicious Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. It has always been great. The gollo burro is to die for. My dad would eat here every week if he could get away with it. Never had a bad meal and I have eaten the entire menu. Wonderful family run business.

Over-hyped and mediocre. Apparently people have never had a char-grilled dog with natural casing. Overall they are not cheap for what you get. Never been impressed by this place despite eating here a half dozen times. The hot dogs at Joe's farm house grill, Sonoran style dogs from Nogales hot dogs, and Short leashes dogs are wayyyy tastier.  TLDR..... MEH

This place sucks, they milked a extended warranty we had purchased with a used car years ago. Every week like clockwork some other expensive component was broke, but it was usually covered. They also almost blew up my car and me in it when they did not install a hose going to my gastank after fixing it. It came off while driving and I dumped a full tank of gas in 30 seconds .

Yummy subs at a good price. The former owners were jerks and would always skimp on the food. The new owners and their employees are friendly, fast, and hook it up.

So good, I eat here at least once a week and never tire. The pickled onions are crack! Chicken and steak both marinated, freshly grilled deliciousness. Beans, rice, and salsa all delicious a fresh too. Cheap and high-quality. Combine tortillas, rice, steak, onions, salsa and sour cream to make tacos then thank me later. Crazy good.

Even with all the 5 star reviews, I was skeptical that this place was the real deal. I was pretty impressed after meeting with Tait to discuss some   work that my 2000 accord needed (per an inspection from SanTan Honda) (purchased the car a month prior) (SanTan Honda is totally overpriced too). When Tait called me back and told me my struts and radiator hoses were perfectly fine, I was pretty pissed at the dealership for lying to me, but really impressed by Hon Man's honestly. Tait and his team made a few recommendations and fixed all the other issues,getting my accord running better than ever on-time and well under budget. This place is the real deal, too bad they can fix all our other (non-honda/acura) cars.....

Fantastic #lowcarb / #keto option with their salads. Their steak salad is basically a cheesesteak with your choice of cheese and grilled shrooms / peppers / onions on a beautiful mix of fresh kale / mixed greens and romaine, broccoli, purple cabbage and cherry tomatoes. Get the jalapeño cilantro ranch and some free sides of pickled jalapeños / cherry peppers to kick it up a notch.  Very good and very fresh.

Arrived at 4:20 on Friday only to find out they closed early with no notice. Even called earlier in the week and said I was going to stop in at 4:30 on Friday. Unacceptable and unprofessional. Won't be giving them my business.

Cheap, fast, delicious food, but be sure to bring plenty of cash, because they don't take cards.  I had a polish chicago style, a small fry, and the beautiful abomination that is only known as a "pizza puff", a deep fried pizza pocket style item that was tasty but really greasy and certainly very unhealthy. I probably wont be eating it again.   Anyway, overall this place was really solid, and the oldschool fries and chicago-style dog were excellent, and the staff was friendly.  While I ate at the picnic tables outside, I most certainly saw the majority of customers get their food to-go.  Going to add this place to my regular lunch rotation for sure.

Always had good, fresh food and friendly service. Their chicken tacos are some of the best I have ever had, and I will always be a customer because one time I ordered but had lost my debit card, and they still fed me and just told  me to come back the next day and pay. There are not many resteraunts or businesses that will do that anymore, and I was impressed.  They also make a pretty good torta and the carne asada is pretty good.   Cheap, fast, and yummy....

Chicken roti curry was amazing. Fall of the bone tender, sweet potato chunks, and not spicy at all. Wash it down with a grapefruit soda. Only minus a star because it was very warm in the place.

Now my favorite Italian resteraunt is the best Italian resteraunt I've found for low carbers. As a low carber, I dread Italian and asian because it's such a challenge to find stuff that I can eat. Rigatonys, brilliantly, will sub out pasta for fresh green beans on most dishes. So good and so delicious. Highly reccomended if you do low carb or keto. Enjoy friends. I highly reccomend the grilled chicken linguini sub for haricot verts.

After 2 recent visits to Archie's I decided to yelp about this place because they are pretty awesome. I used to eat at this place when it was a village inn , so theres a bit of nostalgia. I'm not sure if they are considered a "Jewish" deli but they have all sort of yummy Jewish specialties like Kugel and Matzo ball soup. Anyway, I've had their "Dutchy's" Pastrami Deluxe sandwich and it was to die for. Home-made toasted rye bread, excellent russian dressing, some of the best cole-slaw I have ever had, and the hot pastrami was piled at least 4 inches high. The thing that made the sandwich standout so much was the fact that the pastrami was no fatty or chewy, but still melted in your mouth. The french fries were thick-cut and seasoned with kosher salt, pretty solid but the side of ranch dressing I got was sub-par.   On my next visit I had a cheese-steak hoagie. This thing was massive, and the steak was juicy and tender despite the meat being lean and not fatty. It was served on a nice sesame wheat bun.   My dad had their matzo ball soup which is homemade and light and tasty, unlike allot of places where the matzo ball is dense and boring. He also had half of a Reuben and it was just as generous as the full-size sandwich except cut in half. Their corned-beef is excellent and not fatty or greasy like their other meats.     On both visits the service was prompt and friendly and our drinks were kept refilled constantly. On the first visit our really new waiter made a couple goofs but fixed his errors quickly enough.   The thing I like the most about this place is that it beats the crap out of Chompie's (another popular "Jewish" deli/diner), in my opinion. I've been going to Chompie's for many, many years and we have almost always had bad, painstakingly slow service and borderline rude wait-staff. You would think they would fix it but our complaints have always fallen on deaf-ears.  I can walk into Archie's and get immediately waited on, then have yummy food in under 15 minutes.   They also have tons of home-made and imported baked goodies. I can attest that they brownie was pretty awesome. I want to try their breakfast and their bagels which are imported from NY apparently.   Very, very solid place, almost perfect, the food is great but the decor and tables could use updating, the new wait-staff will get better over time as well I'm sure.

This place is awesome. Cheap and just as good as yogurtland! I had some french vanilla, cookies and cream, and chocolate yogurt and they were all tasty. They have a massive selection of toppings including candy, fruit, and cereal. Inside its relaxing and modern.   I had a big cup of froyo with yummy toppings for just over 3 bucks. The only thing I thought was a bit odd was that they use LCD digital picture frames with memory cards as the labels for the different flavors. Not sure how well they will hold up in the long term but a interesting idea.   Service was friendly and it was very clean. Overall : Awesome

Solid, very solid, but not mind-blowing. Nicer and wider selection than in-n-out, and higher quality ingredients and bigger burgers in general, but also pricier. Nice patio for extra seating.

2 stars because their food is good and beers are cold. But in the last two weeks me and a friend have tried to visit the tavern twice after 11 to take advantage of their "kitchen open daily until 12" which they proudly advertise everywhere. Both times the kitchen has been closed "because they felt like it". Waste of time.

Hmm, not good tonight. The pretzel with beer cheese, which is a stretch to begin with at 10 bucks, was dried out and extremely oversalted. The beer cheese is also not as good as it used to be, and tasted like it was borderline bad. Service was not great either. Beers were fine if not a bad expensive. Won't be back anytime soon.

Bomb. Super fresh and simple. But the toppings bar is out of control. Multiple sauces, salsas, and veggies to go on your tacos. Get all three sauces and load it up with salsa, veggies, slaw, and lime. Fantastic.

Impressed. All the beers are excellent and full of flavor, despite being lower on the abv scale. Habanero confit wings were delicious and well worth the price. Duck fat fries were irresistible and delicious and crispy even when they cooled off. Will be back

Great fresh seafood, reasonable prices, trifecta sauce all day, shrimp, wings, dungeness, fried razor clams, all amazing. Would be better if corn was fresh. Over all great. I think I actually like this place more than boiling crab! This place would be 5 stars if the ambience was a little better.

Really solid. Despite the Takoyaki being just ok and a minor mixup on our order for garlic crab, everything was really good. Highly recommend the salt and pepper shrimp. Beef with scallions, and garlic crab. Everything was fresh and priced great. All the little grilled dishes are fresh and cheap. Fun to try different things. Will be back for hot pot and soju.

Wow, decided to give it another chance after the manager reached out to me. This time we did dungeness, snow crab legs, and motzerella sticks. The crab was some of the best I have ever had. Ali, our server, was friendly and prompt. Great experience. Will be back!

This place has really come along way since its early days. Eaten here twice recently, both dinner and breakfast. Reasonable priced and high quality. I recommend the fried pickles and sea salt chocolate chip cookies. Both the french toast and biscuit breakfast sandwich were also excellent. Try the maple bacon bar for a decadent treat.  Will be back due to the great service and no wait times for Friday night / Saturday morning.

Great little market and Carneceria. Super friendly owner and family owned business. Four Street tacos and a soda for five bucks. Great Carne asada and carnitas. They carry Mexican meats, seafood, and some prepared foods. Excellent prices. A little bit of everything. They even have some produce. Will be back.

D. P.  Dough pre doughpocalypse review: Stopped on the way home to see what it was like before the chaos of tomorrow. Ordered the calzone of the day, which happened to be the Italian, and a half dozen wings to go. Added parm garlic seasoning to the zone'. Owner was super friendly and they had calzone boxes stacked to the ceiling. Order was ready in less than 10 minutes.   Calzone was really good, with a light, airy, slightly chewy crust, the creamy ricotta being the standout ingredient. Tomato sauce was thin and tangy, compliments the zone well. While the wing buffalo sauce was tasty, the wings were on small side and baked, decent but forgettable. Bonus points for their fleet of electric bike scooter things for delivering.   8/10 solid

Excellent. Super friendly prompt service, knowledgeable wait staff, amazing ramen, the braised pork is ridiculous, and they even accomedated my weird low carb diet but subbing noodles for extra bean sprouts. Got extra add in of course. Really enjoyed the spicy Miso base and the shishito peppers. Another thing that too many great places get horribly wrong, the music, the music at tampopo was excellent, artic monkeys, modest mouse, Franz Ferdinand, etc. Will be back here alot.

Wow, what a pleasant surprise, morrocan may be my new favorite cuisine. The simple cucumber salad and hummus with beef were both fresh and a great pair. The beef was seasoned beautifully and super tender. The real WOW dishes here are the beautiful aromatic tajine pots. The chicken was super moist and tender, and the thick bread is the perfect vehicle to mop up the rich, salty broth. The savory and slightly sweet beef tajine was fall apart tender and the stewed apricots are to die for. I also reccomend the mixed grill as everything was tender and seasoned beautifully, more flavorful than your normal kabobs imo.  I will be back at some point to try poutine and one of their delectable deserts. Their gelato and crepe creations look like they are to die for.  This place is absolutely going in my heavy rotation.
