This man ( the owner) doesn't even deserve to be in business.  He needs to put the lamp shade on and turn on the light!  Incredibly poor, Aweful service.  He doesn't even deserve 1 star.  Sad, very sad.. I recommend you never go there

WOW! STEAMEX IS AWESOME!  I'm a very picky person when it comes to my home and hard to please. Chris and his team met every expectation and more. From the very first call to having him do my dining room chairs after I saw what a great job he did on the carpet made this company well worth the money and deserves every bit of the five stars I gave them.  I will never use anyone else except for Chris and the team at Stemex! Thank U !  Oh by the way, if you're into supporting the local guy in our community Chris is the only one to choose.

I am a die hard YELP believer. But after sitting here one hour and 10 minutes for them to give me an estimate I had to write this.  I do not live at the condo that needed the work but when Jim called me and said to be at the property at 11:00  to 11:30 I arrived at 10:55.  He " claims" he was here at 11:10 knocked on the door and left. You answer this question. If only an hour before I got a text from him and I called him back immediately why then would he have not done it again? Was he covering up something? Did he go to the wrong apartment? Could he not get through the security gate ? Was I on the toilet when he  supposing to say he knocked ?   What a terrible, terrible shame for a company to have a five star rating and Jim   who could have easily knocked harder, text me or do what someone who has a Five Star rating should do Call Me !  He would not be working for my company if a team member ever did something like that.  Even after calling him I asked are you sure you were at the right condo? Did you think to text me? Did you think to call me?  Incredibly arrogant person if you ask me.   PS : I was on a flight from Charlotte to Phoenix yesterday and was delayed 4.5 hours and they did reschedule and I really appreciated it. Just not sure what Jim had done.

And know apology from you, the owner, shame on you!  Read my review I did state you were out twice. It's not you or your company it's unfortunately your estimator Jim and I would suggest that customers ask not to have him out till he learns how to call or text a customer!

SUPER SUPER disappointed !   I drove over 30 minutes yesterday to get there only to find they closed 10 minutes early, i showed a guy named Keith my I phone that read 5:50 and all he could say was he goes by their clock.  This guy Keith has been rude to me in the past but I keep going back because I love the great stuff there, In fact I have to go back today :( to get what I wanted yesterday.   Keith told me the owners name was Michael, but I can't seem to find him or his email address.

Well they hit it out of the park again. I'm from CA where I own my own Award Winning Sandwich Shop called Noonerz, so when I tell you ZOOKS is one of the Best, Freshest, Coolest, Hottest, Must Do Spots in Phoenix I totally mean it !  And now every single issues Zooks may ever have had are gone as they moved around the corner to Uptown Plaza and everything is a zillion times better.  Check out their extended hours ( don't forget one of the best Breakfast in town) but now they cater ! Zooks is owned by locals and I feel very strongly that we all should shop and eat in our neighborhood, not in some distant chain owned restaurant.  Do yourself a favor, eat there once, you'll be back many times over.
