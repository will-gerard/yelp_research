I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. I finally had an opportunity to stop for lunch. I am extremely disappointed. The food was gross and the service was terrible.  I got their famous tomato soup and it was like the opened a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of sliced mushrooms and dumped them in a bowl with a little bit of a bisque base.  Aster waiting another 20 min I finally got the ahi appetizer I ordered and the tuna did not appear fresh and had a grayish/brown color and it was all sitting on top of a soupy slaw pile which was absolutely gross! I am so disappointed after all the good things I had heard.  I don't think this place even deserves a 2nd chance.  gross!!!
