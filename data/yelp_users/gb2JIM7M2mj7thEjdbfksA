This place is so slow. I got the express wash at 11am on a weekday and waited 40+ minutes for my car to be done. Wtf.   Oh and now you must need a face or neck tattoo to work here. I didn't know if they were washing/drying my car, or figuring out how to steal it later.   I'm not coming back here. It's not worth $5 to waste almost 45 minutes of my lunch hour.  ---- I just got back to work from the place, and I noticed that 1/2 of my change/quarter pouch and all of my gum was gone. What the hell. My $5 car wash just became a $15 car wash. I called and complained, but what is it going to accomplish. Never again. I'm over this place.

This place should be called "Mediocre Cuts"

Bring on the calories! This is the place to go if you are feeling really hungry, or really under-weight. Where else can you get perfectly fried chicken with waffles? Most of the choices on the menu are reasonably priced, and the new design of the place is open and bright. I also thought it was very clean inside, which one would not expect from a restaurant that prides itself on serving neon colored and super sweet cool-aide.   While the waffles are nothing to write home about, the chicken is fried to perfection. It was tough finding a parking spot, and we had to eventually park across the street. Not knowing if you car is going to get towed kinda made me rush through my meal. The grits left something to be desired - they were dry and had little seasoning. If it wasn't for the huge hunk of butter (which seems to be the only ingredient/condiment that the kitchen used), I would have not eaten the grits at all. Thankfully, the hot sauce made them taste alright.   Will I come back? Probably, but only after I recover from my heart attack from the last visit.

I just picked up a jacket from here. I don't even think that it was altered. It looks the same as when I dropped it off - I could tell (still) it didn't fit right when I tried it on, but I didn't want to make a fuss about it in the store. There goes $30 and here goes my future business. The most frustrating part was that I tried it on and asked her what she thought, and she said "looks good." Well, I got home and tried it on again, and it most certainly doesn't look good. 2 stars instead of 1 because it was returned to me promptly.

I went here for lunch with my co-workers yesterday. The food was excellent, and that's why this place deserves 5 stars. I had a salad and my coworkers for the mole' chicken and tacos. The guac was excellent too. I think everyone finished their plates. If there is any complaint about this place, it's that the food was a little on the pricey side (for lunch). If you come here, be ready to spend about $20 per person, and maybe more if you drink alcohol.  I did glance at the Sunday brunch menu, and that looked excellent and well priced. I will make sure to go here for Sunday brunch. Otherwise, I will only go here if I am looking to impress a girl or if I win the lottery.

Delicious. If you like BBQ and you don't mind adding an inch to your waist, this is a great place. I had the BBQ nachos, which I was told that they were new on the menu. They were great. The cheese was ballpark style and not "fresh," but it sure was delicious. All my coworkers had sandwiches, which looked delicious. This is a great place with a good-sized menu. And you won't leave here reeking of BBQ smoke. Great lunch place if you're in Tempe b

Carne Asada how it was meant to be eaten. The carne asada here is great. While Americas Taco Shop is not the most authentic, they have created excellent carne asada tortas and vampiros. If you go here and order chips & salsa, make sure to get the spicy salsa. It's not that spicy, and it tastes great. Parking can be scarce in the small lot behind the restaurant, so parking down the street on a side street may be your best bet.

THis is my favorite V resturant in Phoenix. I typically go here for lunch or dinner. The food is extremely well priced, and the food always tastes great. While their Pho is great, I recommend the Bun.

Oh so good. If you can grab a table or chair at the bar, then eat here. It's a small ramen restaurant, like the ones you find in Japan. The noodles and broth are excellent. If you only get 1 bowl of ramen, choose one with pork broth. It is way better than the light-tasting chicken broth. This is a great off-the-strip lunch and worth the drive. Get in the know and hit up this place!

It's safe to say that this is the best tapas restaurant I have been to. While the quail was nothing special, the almond and garlic cold soup was superb. If you are in Vegas, be sure to go here. The setting is hip and trendy and the menu is packed with good choices. I didn't try the g&t but it claimed to be great. It's above the chandelier bar in the Cosmopolitan. Be sure to stop by for a great meal in Vegas.

This is a hidden gem in central phoenix. The beef noodle soup, which is my go-to meal, is a milder and garlicky version of pho. When the soup is combined with their light as fluffy bread sticks, it makes a great and pretty complete meal. I also recommend their spring rolls and beef skewers. My friends all love their boba drinks and basil seed drink. The only item I would avoid is their iced tea - it tastes like a floral perfume.   This place is a great place to eat, but the 4 star instead of 5 is due to SSSSSSLLLLLOOOOOWWWW service. DOn't come here for lunch on a workday, because you'll be here forever. Oh, and the bathroom never seems to have paper towels.

Rice Paper is a great place near downtown to get great tasting and fairly authentic V food. I ordered the Bun with pork, which is my favorite V dish. It was great and the helping of grilled pork was substantial - I wasn't left hungry and craving meat after my meal. The bartender was great - she was always present and asking if we needed anything. For being such a small restaurant, there was a great selection of beer and spirits (though I didn't partake, because I had to make it back to work). I was in and out in less than an hour, which is great for a lunch spot. My only complaint is that there isn't a lot of parking. I had to park down the street on a side street. But I guess the fact that the place was full and that there wasn't any parking is a good sign...

While the server was nice, I ordered their goat dish. I tried to eat it, but it smelled horrible and tasted even worse. It was on par with the smell at the zoo - While I am always up for trying new food and new places, I couldn't even take morethan one bite. If it wasn't for the plantains, I would have starved. Also, the food took forever to come out. It was like our table, which was one of three occupied tables, was being ignored. It was a good 20 minutes between ordering lunch and the food being given to us. Also, it doesn't help that the resturant is in a shady shopping center. I will not be going back to this place.

Baristas here are more interested in talking to each other than making an iced tea. 8 minutes? Really?

I grabbed a quick Korean bite for dinner here with my gf. For the $21 I paid, we got heaps of food. The spicy pork was awesome and the veggie pancake was also awesome. Is it a classy place? No. Is it tasty? Yes! Do you get your money's worth? Hell yes!

A great place for a group of friends or coworkers who can't decide what to get for lunch. They have hotdogs (short leash), creme brulee (try the salted carmel), and mexican (lunchalibre' - sorry on the spelling). If it's Friday, you'll probably find me eating here. It does get pretty hot in the summer, since all they have for searing it a big shade cover with folding chairs and folding tables underneath.

This place is awesome. I went in here while I was in Vegas. This placer has a huge selection of favors. I had 2 scoops, chocolate chili and black sesame. The chocolate chili was awesome and spicy, the black sesame was also great and not too sweet. While these scoops were great, my gf's vegan scoops were even better. The vegan pistachio was wonderful beyond all my expectations. You need to try it to believe it. And the service was great. I ate my scoops outside and the owner checked on us a few times and even brought us tea samples. This place was great and for only $4 you can have 2 scoops of happiness.

This place is one of the best vegan restaurants in Phoenix. Hands down. The food was terrific, I had the Bwiskits and Gwavy. My wife had the banana rum pancakes. I don't think I've had such a great brunch in a very long time. My biscuits were fluffy and not dense, and the poblano gravy was very satisfying. My wife's pancakes were absolutely delicious - the rum banana glaze was extra tasty. My only negative for this place is that there was not much seating, which means you need to get here early! I highly recommend this place, Vern of not, you will leave here happy and full.
