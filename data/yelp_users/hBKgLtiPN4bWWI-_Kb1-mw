Thanks yelpers, following advice of others is not always good.  This place was a big let down. I was excited for a minute when I saw a full parking lot and small crowd inside but once the food arrived all I can do is smh.  The horchata was decent but that was the only positive about this meal unfortunately. The service was also non existent, not attentive or nice at all which made the experience even worse.  We did get tortilla chips but the salsa was so fricken spicy none of us could eat it, what a waste. The kids ordered tacos that were inedible, we ordered a soft taco but got a hard one instead and the other kid ordered fish tacos that were so spicy he couldn't eat them at all.  And the waitress took the order directly from them so how do you screw those up, kids would not eat their tacos, does that make any sense?  How hard is it to screw up a taco?  Me and my other companion both ordered chicken chimichangas that were crunchy and delish looking on the outside but one bite and We were both disgusted. All dark meat, no flavor, super dry and unseasoned meat, no kind of sauce inside or out, cheese not even melted on top. I will say that the avocado thrown on the side was good but unfortunately it didn't make up for the bad meal. The beans are cooked in lard with no vegetarian alternative so all you vegans don't bother coming here. Anyways, first time leaving a restaurant with full plates that none of us finished or taken home as left overs. And sell hungry but will opt out of Yelp for dinner tonight. Still fuming over such a dreadful lunch.

Almost easy to miss, in a strip mall right before the 101 freeway.  Dining area is clean, staff is very friendly. We ordered the princess combo which comes with chicken shawerma, beef shawerma, chicken and beef kabob, rice, hummus and salad. All the meat was very good, cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. Hummus was excellent. We also tried the falafel which I loved, perfect recipe and cooked perfectly. There's a market inside so you can shop after you eat. All in all, it was a great lunch experience.

Really cute hip coffee hangout. Most of their pastries are gluten free. The place is always busy especially on the weekend but its a great place to meet over coffee.  They serve basic breakfast options and their service is fast and friendly.

Good decent turkish style kebab and shawerma joint.  The service was ok, they have a decent sized dining room but its kind of dingy inside and needs a facelift. I prefer the outdoor dining area, its more appealing. Parking is plentiful and there's a middle eastern grocery store next door which is convenient.

Been here once so far when I'm in town and we loved this place. when I'm in town and looking for a hangout with friends this is the place to go for drinks and late night food. Cool vibe not too loud, nice outside patio, great music selection.

Good solid NY style pizza.  Ordered over the phone for pickup, basic large cheese. Arrived 25 mins later, was greeted at the door and checked out immediately $15 and some change, pizza was ready and piping hot.  Pizza tasted very good, authentic to NY taste, awesome NY crust, stretchy gooey yummy cheese, no complaints everyone loved it.

Very nice family outing. The kids loved it, it was very small I envisioned it being miles of lights but a walk around the lagoon was plenty especially in cold temps. If you go after 8 you can find closer parking spaces since most families with small children will be leaving by then. Admission is a little pricey for what you get but go Ina value night and buy tickets online and it's not a bad deal.

This little Lebanese restaurant of a gem was the best middle eastern food I've had in Phoenix in a long time (and there are many mediocre and horrible alternatives all over the valley). All Mashawi selections are perfectly cooked, fresh and delicious food as well as warm, tentative great service. We ordered a grilled combo for 4 which came with rice and salad and everything was perfectly cooked and delicious, the meat selection was tender and amazing. We also ordered the medium mezza which included babaganouj, hummus, tabouli and falafel and everything was excellent. We had so much food on the table and to take home. The grilled combo was very good quality of meats cooked to perfection. We also ordered kibbe which was very good and the tabouli was perfectly made. This will definitely be a place I will come back to next time I'm in town.
