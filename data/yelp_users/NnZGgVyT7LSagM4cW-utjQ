Everything about this place is great.  Awesome staff, awesome accommodations, awesome gear, awesome atmosphere.  My band has been coming here for two years now and I would never consider going anywhere else.

I actually signed up for yelp just to review this place. So with that out of the way here is my first review.  I had been wanting to try this place for awhile as I live right around the corner; But, my wife had heard some bad things and refused to go with me. Luckily, I have a friend who is as bold as I am when it comes to taking leaps of faith into dives.  So, we walked into this place around 2 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon and the restaurant is completely dead. Excluding a few bar patrons ogling the girl working the bar. My buddy and I continue to stand about for a couple of minuets before we're told to seat ourselves, at which point we get away from the bar and seat ourselves in the back corner of the dining room as to dodge the lingering smell of something burnt plaguing the eating area.  We get our menus and our drink orders are taken. After taking a look at the menu I was fairly excited as all of it sounded delicious. The price point was a little on the high side, but I guess that's to be expected when your restaurant isn't pulling in too much business.  I settled on the fried tender-loin sandwich and my buddy settled on the two meat combo plate (brisket and pulled pork). It took a fair amount of time for our food to come out given how many people were actually eating in the restaurant at the time - about 25 minutes. I was pretty stoked on this as I assumed it meant all of our food was being made fresh.  I was wrong.  The tenderloin was a massive piece of burnt batter that lined the entire plate, served with old pickles, wilted lettuce, and some questionable tomatoes. My buddy's combo plate literally looked like a plate of dog food. Without going into too many unsavory details, I will sum up the taste of our food with two words : utterly terrible.  The cowboy beans that can be chosen as a side are probably one of the worst things I have ever eaten. It was the equivalent of grabbing a handful of ash out of a campfire and stuffing it into your mouth. The texture was right there as well - just complete mush.  All in all, this is a terrible restaurant, complete with terrible food. I won't even  touch on the barbecue sauce. As I'm sure you'll know to prepare for disappointment after seeing how it is treated on the table (read: POORLY). The only saving grace of this place is the staff, as they're attentive to a certain degree.

I had a horrible experience at this restaurant about 2 years ago.  A few months back and I decided to give this place another shot and I'm glad I did. It was a slammed Sunday and the service was incredible. Really attentive, drinks kept full, beers kept cold.  Food was excellent. Sauce still needs work but I would definitely come back here.  Great job at stepping it up, guys!
