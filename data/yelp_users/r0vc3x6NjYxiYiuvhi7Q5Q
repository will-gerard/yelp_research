I can't say enough great things. I just happened to be walking by and made an appointment for a cut and color. Miranda is great! To me the prices are average for an Aveda salon. My friend in Dallas is MUCH more expensive.  I decided to also get my eyebrows waxed and Lily was also super. Both took the time to discuss what I've been doing recently and even developed a plan for reshaping my brows for a more dramatic effect. Nobody has really done that.  I will be back. Love Ide Mania.

I was actually really impressed today. The chips were nice and crispy. The cheese enchilada was AMAZING. I know what you're thinking. How can you mess up a cheese enchilada? Well, having had some pretty mediocre ones lately, this one really stands out. The sauce was nice and tangy and the cheese was ooey gooey melted perfection. Had a pretty decent margarita too. I sat at the bar during lunch and the service was great and fast. Now, why is it whenever they say the plate is really hot, the first thing I do is grab it? Muy caliente! I highly recommend this place.

Do I get the fanciest mani or pedi here? Not so far but I've been here several times and Cindy is pretty awesome. Last July she treated my 9 year old like a princess for her birthday. Today I walked up at 3:30 not realizing they closed at 3 on Sunday. They were cleaning up to go home and she stayed to give me a much needed pedicure. so,  I'll definitely come back. It's conveniently located because I prefer third Fry's to other grocery stores in the area too.

This is one of our favorite restaurants in cave creek. The views from the patio are breathtaking even if you don't play golf. I can't even decide what I like best about the menu. Drinks, wine, appetizers, dessert and everything in between is consistently good. Even when we've had an unexpected problem with a dish they have always been quick to make things right. They have a pretty decent happy hour. It's a kid friendly resort but I've heard on other sites that you might want to leave your baby at home. That's ok with me because it's a fairly romantic place and I'd rather your kid not ruin my date night. Other than that, go there.

I don't want to tell you how good it was because then you'll want to go there. Small shop, run by a couple. You'll definitely need an appointment. Got a cute little snowflake on my toes (I'll post pics later) and, seriously, the best foot and hand massage I think I've ever had in Arizona.

One of the best meals in a long time. My only regret is not eating there years ago. The red booths and decor are great for a romantic dinner but also allow for chatting with your neighbors which added to the fun.  Probably the best martini ever. Stirred not shaken.  Everything we selected was excellent. The calamari was was tender and the coating was perfectly light and crispy. Loved the blue cheese dressing on my salad. My dining partner said it was one of the best prime ribs ever. If I ever had a time to use the word "succulent," it would be to describe the scallops.  The service was fantastic. The server overheard talk of my birthday so he made sure to put a candle in my creme brulee. This was an all around fantastic experience.

I absolutely LOVE this place. I am going to miss living right down the street. Great Happy Hour (mussels oh MY). Great Bartenders and the food is beyond Compare. They stir instead of shaking the martinis AND have my favorite vodka, Tito's. Gayle is just a delight every time I go in. I've also made a few friends hanging out there. OH and the ambiance! Get there. Now.

They are quite busy so I snuck in and grabbed a table in the bar. Chips are light and crunchy. Salsa was good. I need to tell you about the amazing pescado lunch. $9.99 and it was mahi mahi today. Grilled and topped with pico de gallo. Cooked perfectly. Moist and flavorful. Also served with rice. The rice is good. Not mind blowing but have I mentioned the FISH?? Get here before you're starving if you want to enjoy the fabulous courtyard.

This is our new favorite restaurant. Beautifully landscaped and wonderfully cozy interiors. It's like an Italian villa with intimate dining rooms and a few gorgeous private rooms. Amazing wine list with barbera by the glass and that is rare. We shared a couple appetizers. Fried mushrooms - I know sounds like bar food but trust me. They were amazing with this aioli type dipping sauce. Do not leave without the grilled octopus in your belly. Husband loves to cook and he said the tuna special was the best tuna he's had at a restaurant. I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked with this spicy romesco sauce. Too full for dessert (and nothing sounded like I couldn't live without it). I can't wait to go back for the caprese - mozzarella flown in from Italy and the gnocchi!!!

The portions are HUGE! Probably the biggest biscuits I've ever seen (I didn't order them). Amazing, fluffy pancakes and they give you 2 syrups. I built my own omelette and since I don't get any meat, they let me have extra veggies. It seems like it's a very meat centric menu but that's ok. They seem to work with you on things. It's a rustic lodge environment. Family friendly but also free flowing booze. There is a bar and counter with open seating. I'll definitely come back with friends and family. Now I'm going to finish "m m m my mimosa"

Cute little shop. Very friendly owner and staff. Amazing deals! 100 wines. $25 or less. We've made some great finds and joined their wine club which gets us discounts off their already low prices. They also carry some wine related accessories and serve snacks like cheese plates (not as good as my homemade ones but still). Seems to have a lot of locals from the neighborhood that hang out regularly. Not that I know them.

Just absolutely amazing food. It could possibly the best sushi/Asian fusion food I have had. The Brussels sprouts and scallops dynamite roll were off the chain but the black cod is where it's at. Love the shochu infusions. Happy hour drink prices are pretty good. We will be back! oh and we love the lounge area in the bar.

I hate to do this but...this place has been consistently disappointing. The last 2 times I went with my husband we were charged more on the bill than the menu price but they are so short staffed, it was impossible to get anyone's attention in a timely manner to point this out (so we ended up paying and leaving because we had places to be). We emailed the owner about this and got no response! We ran into him a neighboring business and when we tried to talk to him about it he bolted (he was nice until he realized we had negative feedback).  Now about the food. In a word, it's bland. I've been impressed with one thing there. The pumpkin pancakes. The first time I went I ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich and was informed they didn't have all of the veggies listed but were substituting others. Only the sandwich came and not only were these veggies undercooked, they were clealy not roasted and it didn't have the items I was told it would. Again it was pretty flavorless. Husband had beef stroganoff and had to add a lot of salt.   They have my favorite vodka but the drinks are way overpriced compared to the place down the road where we saw the Heart and Soul owner!  I REALLY wanted to like this place and have tried at least 4 times. Not any more. Not EVER.

Justin convinced us to come back and give them another try. The service was great this time. I had the joshy something (kind of like eggs Benedict with jalape√±o cheese instead of hollandaise) and my husband had the cowgirl (fried chicken thing with green chili and gravy on it). We actually enjoyed it very much this time. Didn't have any cocktails but I'm sure those are about the same. I'll up my rating and be willing to go back again. We got to sit in the car this time, which added to the experience.

My husband and I went to Cartwright's again tonight and we loved it, as usual. We had some issues but they resolved them so much better than the last "favorite" place where we had issues last week. We wanted to sit in the bar because my husband wanted oysters for $1.50 each, which he was told on his visit in January were all day, everyday. (See his review from jan 15). We casually mentioned it and Mary, our server, not to be confused with the other Mary that works there, worked diligently to sort that out for us - Even though it wasn't that big of a deal. The oysters were great and I have been afraid of them since high school.  Hubs got the chefs feature which was filet medallions and and scallops with some amazing asparagus and potatoes. I ordered the scallops with corn cakes, mole and jicama slaw. It was amazing. We had a small problem but I don't want to focus on that because Ive never written a review for them and we love them. We take friends there when they come to visit. It's rustic and yet romantic and ahem, they have a tv in the bar for your playoff game needs. (Go Spurs Go!!!) We go and we go often. Lunch is also awesome and they have good deals! Seafood,  steaks, quail, bison and elk are available plus vegan options. Oh, and they have Tito's vodka! (This is my most horribly written review, sorry)

Wow oh wow. Do I get a warm greeting when I walk in? Usually, no. I have yet to eat or drink something here that didn't amaze me. This is my 3rd time and the mussels dijonaise are the best mussels ever. I wanted a straw to drink up the rest of the sauce. Other notables: great wine list, house made limoncello, smoked salmon avocado toast, the burrata appetizer, the bleeping gnocchi (treat yo self!) and the super trendy decor. I wish I lived closer so it would be a cheap uber ride home. Do yourself a favor. Come here. Tell them I sent you. Haha.

This is my favorite Joint so far! I hate that I don't know the doctors name because he's the best thing that ever happened to my back!! He adjusts me like Nobody's business. Conveniently on my way home from work too! Love. Love. Love.

I am a HUGE fan of Pita Jungle. The last experience was a disappointment and was the first time my husband had been there. The staff (both coming on and leaving) were hanging around eating and drinking with aprons on. The food was just so-so. I usually LOVE their pita bread but the stuff we got seemed like it was just some dried up store bought stuff. We just stopped in for tapas and a drink and I doubt we will return to this location for a full meal any time soon. :(

One of my favorite things about downtown living. Not sure how I spent $20 for lunch and didn't even have any booze but I did get some Creme Brulee to bring home. I highly recommend this treat.

Joe from Azteca Pest Control came out today and I was very impressed! He was very thorough and I was pleasantly surprised by all the extra steps Azteca uses compared to services we have used in the past. He brushed all the cobwebs out of the corners of our high ceilings. They use a fine powder to get behind the walls under the sinks.   He even pointed out some areas where bugs could be getting in that I didn't know were leaving us vulnerable. I can't wait to see the results of his work or rather, I hope we DON'T see any more bugs!

I love the location. McDowell and 7th (plenty of places to eat and drink before or after an appointment ). The interior design is modern and funky. They have refreshments available which is nice and this interesting spray in the bathroom to use *before* you make it stinky. This is important when there's only 1 toilet. Just saying. I saw a girl getting an amazing makeup job done.  Most importantly, Roger Montoya is now doing hair there. He's got quite the loyal following and I know this place is gonna be packed because of him!! Please see my photo. He does amazing work! I'll be back in a few more weeks!!

LOVE it!! Stacy was always an awesome bartender at Bar One and having his own place just brought him to another level. The prices were good and they have TITO'S vodka. The only thing I don't like is I don't live within walking distance anymore!!! There is a dance floor but we were only there for happy hour. We did have the couches reserved for a birthday party which was a nice touch. Get your butts down there!

I love Roger! I've been a super big fan of his for a couple years now. I've previously reviewed other salons solely based on on Roger's work.  His work is impeccable and we've been working the last year to grow out and repair the damage I did when I let someone else touch my locks.  I love the Hair Studio where he's set up his own little spot now. It's a great location in the camelback corridor.  I'll follow Roger anywhere. Except maybe Siberia. I hate Siberia. I guess I could visit but I wouldn't want to live there.   If you bring him a caramel frap, he'll love you forever.

This is possibly our new favorite. I feel like we say that a lot but this is like Sassi but slightly less expensive and the food is pretty comparable. Sassi has the advantage of the amazing grounds but we love the light airy feel of Spiga. I went once for lunch and now my husband and went for dinner together. The octopus appetizer is amazing. I had the monk fish special for dinner. Seriously delightful! The amatricana was fabulosity. I also has the beet ravioli previously and it was surprising, different and refreshing. The drinks are good. Though this time some things were missing from my cocktail. The wine list is spectacular with DOC and other designations for the Italian wines. We have already told friends to go there. Oh and the tartufo dessert is a can't miss.

Wandered in while looking for a snack in the afternoon. They were super attentive because they've only recently opened. Modern decor.  Multi level seating and tv's at bar(s).  I had the mussels and they were fantastic. The mussels were plump and fresh and the tomato broth was worth asking for extra bread (or a straw). I am not sure which glass of wine I needed up having because the server got confused (I sampled 2 and picked one but may have been served another). Still it was a good experience and reasonably priced so I'd go back given more time and will bring some friends next time.

We love this place so much we've been there 3 times since it opened! They're still working out a few kinks but almost everything is a masterpiece. Things we've tried, loved and recommend are as follows. Appetizers: lemon garlic prawns, kabobs, scallops, mushroom flatbread were all amazing. Salads: charred romain and Catalina are great. We've had the filet, ago, lobster ravioli, strip, duck, and seafood pasta. The clam appetizer needs a little work. The seafood pasta would be better with a different noodle. Everything needs a little more seasoning. We saw the Brie appetizer yesterday and it looked amazing. They don't have a kids menu but the owner, Ron, spent half an hour with our table going over suggestions from our friends' children. Cave creek needed a place like this. We love some of the other places but the wine lists are lacking. Indigo crow has an awesome wine and drink selection! The happy hour is one of the best we've seen! We love the decor and the outside bar. There's a separate wine bar and eventually upstairs will be a lounge type section. Get there. Now.

Worst experience I have had in a long time. My friend from Texas was in the mood for a burger and didn't want to go to a national chain so she could experience the local food. I had been to Tru Burger once for Happy hour and had a good experience so she went there to get some take out. She got the Bison burger and also got a veggie burger topped like the California burger for me. Fries and truffle fries were added to the order. She waited at least 30 minutes to get her food while the server/bartender - Davin - was chatting with a friend of his. She sat at the bar waiting for service and he shouted at her from across the bar what she would like to drink. Didn't come over and greet her or anything. Once she got her tea, he never checked on her or offered to refill her drink. He was too busy chatting with his friend (the restaurant was not busy).  When the food was brought to her she tried to open the bag to make sure everything was in there but it was tied shut. DJ, the manager, snapped at her and said she packed it herself and that everything was there. When she got back to my house the food was cold. The fries were soggy and inedible. We had to reheat the burgers to even choke them down. When we called to complain we were told to bring the food back and they would refund our money. Bottom line: my friend is going home with a bad taste in her mouth (literally) and my husband and I will never go to to Tru burger again. BTW, my husband says the best bison burgers are at Tonto and Cartwright's in Cave Creek.
