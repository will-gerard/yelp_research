Our favorite place to come watch a movie. The only place we come to, but since the menu change we have started to eat before the movie. Which cuts down a lot of revenue for the theater. We used to leave with at least a $70-$100. The traditional wings here used to be amazing, now it feels as if it's chicken nuggets. There's no more dynamite chicken. The Loaded Tots are good and the Brussel sprouts but the Mac and cheese are all good but over reaching. I had the Grill Chicken quinoa and I didn't enjoy it, it came out cold.   So the place is good but it used to be great and it felt like it got boring. Lacked inspiration. The boneless chicken wings and the southern chicken tenders are the same. Drinks are still good, but since I eat now before I come it's not fun to order a drink. I'm looking forward to a revamp again. This place could be amazing. I used to talk about how great the chefs choices and how the cooks were, now it's blah.

This is my first time eating here!! No I believe that in a review there should be everything from food to ambience and scenery involved. So here we go.  I've always been apprehensive in going here bc I don't care for gyros. So I went today to try out the food and I was surprised.  I got the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was very good. The sauce was right now. Perfect flavor profiles. Just the right amount of salt and spice. The chicken was delicious had been marinated and flavored on it's own. I was impressed. And the rice wasn't dry! Very good.  The energy of the place was perfect for lunch. That's when I went. Energy, fast paced and great. The service was awesome. Always attentive on the drinks being filled. And the food getting out quick.   And my favorite part. A lot of great looking guys. Very handsome. Girls and gays would love it here. And I'm sure the girls were pretty but I didn't notice. I will be going back for the scenery and the delicious food.

The Mission has been a place that I have always wanted to go to. It's in the area of town that I'm always in.   I had tried twice to make reservations and I couldn't get a spot. It made me want to go even more. Finally I was able to get in and have dinner.  When we walked in the place was beautiful. Dim lighting a buzz of lively chatter and happy people. We were promptly shown to our seats. It was as we had imagined. When we sat down we waited for about 5 mins until our waitress came to take our drink order. We put our drink orders and appetizer orders in. We got the Duck Confite  and Faus Gras Empanadas. It was so good. Oh man it was delicious. After about 15 mins I started to worry about why our waitress had not come to take our order. I had finished my drink and didn't get a water refill. By this time I was frustrated. It was until 38 mins later did our waitress come back to take our order. I was livid but she came with a bit of an attitude. I had noticed it in the beginning and now it was apparent that she was acting as if she didn't want to be there and we were an inconvenience. It started to get warm, very warm. She came back and asked us if we needed anything else and before we could answer she walked off. The drink I had ordered was good but the Margarita we had ordered wasn't the one we ordered and when we politely asked her to get the right drink we ordered she rudely replied "I don't understand, that's what you ordered, *rolled her eyes* well what else would you like?"  We replied with "um well I'll just have a classic margarita, no salt on the rim" and she replied with "are you sure?" Which then I answered "oh we are sure sweetheart, we would rather not wait 39 mins to receive our drinks" the food was good but small small Portions. The margarita we received had a salt rim and was not worth the $13 charged. We were also charged the drink we asked to not be charged for bc we didn't order it.   When we told her that our drink had that charge she replied with "well I guess I can go take that off" she replied with a "nevermind" we paid and left.   I was extremely disappointed and upset and didn't enjoy my time at all. It was a terrible experience and I do not want to return. The Mission is great looking but staff needed more training. Maybejust her. I was sad.

Great area, pretty place. Good atmosphere. We were greeted promptly and say quickly. And then about 20mins later after we sat, we were served after I had to get up and walk across the restaurant to tell our hostess. And after we were served, the service was boring and lazy. It was a disaster. Ruined my dinner. But honestly. That was a huge mistake and we weren't comps or given a small discount or even an apology from the manager. I'll go back and try it again for a better review. But still.

Sssssooooooooopooo we came to Bliss for Karaoke like always, a gay restaurant/bar, with a group of 20 people, and they have no karaoke tonight... Bc of the Super Bowl.... 90% of the people who come here to karaoke do NOT watch sports, let alone a game that doesn't have our home team. While I'm here there has been several regulars who came in and left to spend their money at the 3rd less desirable Kobalt for Karaoke, And spending their money there. As a Front of the House Manager of another restaurant here in town I would say this was a bad move and huge loss of revenue especially since it's been half dead here today. This is second time I've come here and karaoke is off. I still love this place but please let's not cancel this ever again.

I very much enjoy the property. It's an awesome area. Very close to the freeway, close to downtown, old town and Arcadia. There's a Target, Costco, Frys and Ross nearby.   I moved in here in Jan of this year and really like it. The grounds are kept very nicely. My area is nice and clean and so is the entire property and there's a very nice dog park that is kept clean!   I love it here bc everyone is nice and the office is very helpful. Whenever I put in for a maintenance problem, it's fixed quickly!! Parking is great. The pool looks nice, I just haven't been.  It's a very nice area and I enjoy it here. I'll be here for a lot longer.

Moodswings was great!!!!! It was exactly what I wanted!!! They were very prompt and on top of things. I had an appt for 5:45pm and I was seen right on time! It was amazing.   My stylist was Julz!!! She was great. She cared and did what I wanted with my hair not what she thought. She was amazing at fades which most people aren't. I am very very very happy with my cut. Also she paid attention to how I wanted my hair styled and not just a quick style before I left. She styled with product I was interested in and did my hair the way I liked it.   And the hand massage was amazing!!!! Over all, it was an amazing location, great space, amazing energy and just all around I was energetically happy!

North was a very very great place. The ambience was great! It's a big open area, but very intimate.   Our server was very quick and happy to serve us. I feel service besides the food is very important, bc if my service sucks my experience and appetite are lost.   The Artichoke I had was amazing and I had never had one! Incredible first experience and appetizer.  I had the steak and it was cook perfectly and very well seasoned.  I will be going back. It's very inviting!

I really don't know what else there is to be said about Binks. It's an incredible casual setting of Binkleys. I love Binkleys and have always went. And now that Binks is closer to my place I go all the time.    Incredible place. Calming classic vibe. Clean. The staff is calm wonderful and eclectic. The food is beyond phenomenal. And I love how they have some items on the menu that are different but bc you trust the name Binks you trust that the food combinations will work so you try out the new adventure of food and it comes out wonderful!! It's just great. We went during restaurant week as well, and it was perfect. It's that bite of food that instantly puts a smile on your face.

Went to The Mix-Up last week for drinks and appetizers and it was very nice. Quiet and great ambiance. I ordered a Bourbon Drink which I had never had and I didnt very much like it and very graciously said he could make me another drink. I got a French 75, my favorite drink, and it was mae perfectly. Id never had it made that well so i had asked how he made it. Very very kind bartender and staff. Beautiful area. Im heading there tonight to their $8 burgers and drinks.

So I went there again on their Burger and Bourbon Night. The burger was so freaken good, it had a perfect blend of mild spices, and topped with a melted smoked mozzarella. The fries were great, a White Truffle Oil with a Garlic Lemon Aioli. And the drinks are perfect. I always get a French 75 and the bartender makes it very well. Charlie, the bartender/ server is extremely nice and very much a mans man, and very handsome! Men would enjoy the surroundings and the drinks. Great for business and hanging out. Women would love it for Charlie, Women Wednesdays and the great foods.

I stumbled upon Joyride during their soft open and was graciously invited in for dinner and drinks. Ate almost everything and drank a lot and it was free. Amazing ambience and great people and music and servers. The food was amazing, we were blown out the water. Especially the Veggie Taco's, Im a meat guy, but the Veggie Taco was out of this world. Oh man we loved it. My BF and I decided we were definitely going back.  We went back a second time. The ambience was still amazing and lively and we sat down,and ordered drinks and food and were so excited bc we talked it up. And the waitress was so awesome. The food came, and there was something off. The food went from a 10/10 to an 8/10.  3rd time i went with some new friends who were excited to go bc of how much we talked it up. The ambience and people were lively, great staff and ordered the food and drinks and the food came and it was like "what the heck is happening", it was a 7/10. Friends looked at me like "Youre at culinary school and you eat at a lot of places around the world and this is what you like?"  4th time Again the ambience and staff is great and lively, but the food wasnt great. I didnt enjoy it at all. No one did. it was a 6/10  Finally the 5th time, same, great ambience but the trio salsa was gross, and the food, i wanted to just scarf it down to leave. I wanted to ask for the Chef, but the food has been consistently gross. We decided to stop going.

My Latte was as expected, my order went well and friendly, but the staffs behavior was absolutely embarrassing, immature and uncalled for. I would rather go to Sip of they continue to act like this.   Some guy with long hair, who seems to be working here temporarily, is absolutely ridiculous. He's talking extremely loud for the entire store to hear and very unprofessional. I want to know why the Shift isn't redirecting this. Lack of leadership, which then turns into horrible customer service. We are all uncomfortable. And for this to be a new store, I expected the best partners to be brought here.  This guys is loud, he's whistling, he is talking about products that he doesn't like, which is bad for sales, he's inappropriate to customers in drive-thru, reprimanding them for the way they ordered their drinks, telling them they owe him money. Even as I sit here I am extremely annoyed.   The others working here today, date Sept 24th, time 12:50, are being unprofessional as well laughing along with him.   They are talking about a girl named Bella and he is saying how she was fired from the her location because she was taking tips, they were speaking about a Collin guys who they think is hot and can't wait to take him to the gay club and get some drinks into him. He just said "Commo Esta" to someone in the drive thru and they said "we don't speak Spanish" and he said "sorry, I would have expected you too". He just told some girl "yo Eli your drink is ready, where are you? Oh it's a mobile order" he yelled it to the whole store.  The store has 7 people in it now, when I started this Yelp, bc of the this crazy behavior it was filled, people have left since then, about 20 minutes of sitting here and observing. The partners are really working, looks like their bar is cleaned now, product put away, they are sitting here batting away about how he was fired(guy with long hair) and he didn't care, but he needs the money and Starbucks would take him back.  The tables haven't been wiped down, bathrooms are a mess, and I can't work bc of his obnoxious voice. I've been here 5 times and this seems to be consistent laziness, but this guy just took me to my edge.   There's now someone hanging out behind the bar without work close on, an obvious partner but that's unprofessional. The drive thru guy(guy with long hair) just told the customer that they are so busy he hasn't had time to wash his hands, idk why he would even say that.   I have always been proud of Starbucks business but this place is a joke. I'm offended and sickened and I know this sounds dramatic but the way this is being ran, it needs some sort of change.   The girl who was just behind the counter without work clothes, her name is MacKenzie, and I know that because she just left and the guy behind the bar behind bar at the drive thru(long hair) he jail said "bye MacKenzie forever, I hope you die" while she was outside. And he is saying he hates her and that he hopes she dies outside  during her 5k run. And that he isn't a runner bc he drinks smokes and F@cks only, oh and he has several bands that he is in and that he plays at lounges to make more money bc Starbucks doesn't pay  "sh!t".   I think I can tell who this Shift manager is bc she is keeping a distance are the far end of the bar. Like she's to afraid to talk to them about their behavior, but again, Starbucks is a customer service store. And they are offending everyone in here.   Now the guy with long hair is eating some apple pieces and not washing his hands which is a complete health code violation.   He just now ask a customer how they were. And they said "good how are you" and he said "good not dead, well i am inside" they said "oh no don't say that, it's a great day" and he said "well to each their own"     I understand there are behind the scenes behavior and things that are aloud and cool thing you let slide but he is atrocious. This girl here who I think is a shift is names Adeena or something like that. He just yelled at her across the store as she's wiping tables and even though he has a walki on and she does.   He is talking about his fans and followers from his band and how you sort of have to use them to get where you are. Ask for money from the crowds and pass a hat around getting money. Again this is not conversation that should be have had at work and this is definitely nothing that is customers should here. I am sitting at the far end of the store closest to the traffic lights. Anyways I'm done writing this is just crazy.    He just said over the mic "what's good baby, welcome to Starbucks"   This guy needs to be stopped.

Every time I go to Base Pizzeria, the moment i walk in the door, I'm greeted like a guest in their home! It's wonderful.   Then I have a seat at a table and I am immediately greeted with water and menu. Perfect.   Everything in the pizzeria is Organic for those of you who enjoy that aspect, but one thing I love and appreciate about Base Pizzeria is the fact that I can eat pizza and not feel as if I just broke my diet plan. The veggies are fresh and amazingly delicious. The salads are amazing. They put care into their product.   They are consistently serving me great customer service, great food, and great Organic Margaritas!   I will continue to come back, I will spread the word like wild fire.

I love this gym so much. The owners Will and Erin are so passionate about our gym. It's a beautiful place and incredible equipment.   When I think of CrossFit I think of Black Storm. It's a community and a family. We are all striving together to get our personal best and we support eachother to do better. Will and Erin are very knowledgable and they also are great role models and mentors of CrossFit. They are very humble and willing to work with everyone to be a better self in the box. I'm so happy here.  Great AC, especially for AZ. Clean gym. Rogue equipment and great prices.
