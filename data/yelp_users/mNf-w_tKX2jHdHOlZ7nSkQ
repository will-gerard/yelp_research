I love this place. Its loud, colorful and fun to shop. There are soooooooo many things in this store that are very uncommon finds. They carry items you wont find locally anywhere else. The prices are great and the restaurant food tastes awesome.

At first I was turned off by the name but one day I finally went inside and I must say I was happily surprised. They have TONS of hair, products, accessories, etc! The staff is always nice and the prices are pretty reasonable.

Man Im ADDICTED to this place! Ive even got my kids addicted and now they turn their nose up to places like subway, lol.  My favorite is a combo sandwich called the Jamaican white widow. It is absolutely amazing just a tip, take the pickle out the middle and eat it on the side, it tastes better like that for some reason. The rice krispies, tang and kool aid are the perfect compliment. If I smoked I would totally eat here all the time.  Actually I don't and I already do so there you go! Just grab your keys and go, I promise you will NOT be disappointed. The environment, the staff, fast service, high quality ingredients and a menu full of amazing strands that compliment the amazing sandwiches, what more can you ask for...... Maybe a cheba hut IV so you can be fed cheba hut intravenously 24/7 LOL

Its really a 4 in 1 spot! It has a barbershop, mexican food restaurant, auto detailer and carwash! Truly a one stop shop, lol. The car washes are always on point. They shine my rims amazingly, clean the glass inside & out very well and its all done by HAND! The little mexican spot inside has really good food to snack on while you kill time waiting for your car to be washed. Ive never used the barbershop or detailer yet but the place always has customers so perhaps they know what they're doing.

My family loves this place! Everytime we go our experience has been great!! We get the honey hot wings extra crispy and the kiddies love the jalapeno popper burger! The fries, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, mushrooms & zucchini are all pretty tasty. The place looks ghetto and don't be surprised to get hit up for spare change outside. The booths & chairs are ratchet so we've always took our food to go. What they lack in looks and charm they make up for in taste as far as I'm concerned.

My kids LOVE this place. The burritos and servings are HUGE! My kiddies love the super nachos, rolled tacos and the carne asada fries. 3 of us can all share one meal, lol sometimes. Dont think your gonna be able to eat a burrito solo. I tried it once with a breakfast burrito and didnt even make it half way before the "itis" had me falling asleep at work! Never again, lol.

I LOVE this place. When I want to get out and have a nice quiet place to hangout I go here. However sometimes its not always quiet because of bad ass kids running around, but thats the parents fault not the library. Sometimes people dont control their kids and it can get a little loud and annoying. The lakeviews and furniture are nice and comforting. There are plenty of tables for studying and web surfing on your laptop.

Not bad at all! Love the BBQ Pork and crab puffs. Not a fan of the fried rice though.

Yes at times the level of service may fluctuate depending on how busy they are but it hasn't stopped me from coming back again, and again nor has it stopped my kids from requesting it on family night!  You cant beat the prices and the wings and drinks are always fresh and pleasing.  You can come hang at the bar and even do a lil karaoke. Or you can bring the fam and watch a game on any one of the hundred tv's on the walls.  My favorite drink is the "Liquid Marijuana"  and my fav wing flavors are spicy honey mustard, asiago parm and bar b que HOT! Matter fact Im about to go eat there right now! I love this place. Maybe the problem is YOU, ever think about that? LOL #some people are just hard to please

I was excited when I saw this place was opening because its closer than Marcia's Long Wongs which is where my family and I usually go. I put in our usual order and was very disappointed! Everything thing tasted "soggy". The wings were not very good and the fries were soft, soggy and not very good at all. I'm not giving them a 3 star or higher because I think they have a lot of improving to do.
