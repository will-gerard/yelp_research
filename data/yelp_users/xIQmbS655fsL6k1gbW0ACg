I love their happy hour! We've gone there a few times and sadly, the service isnt the best (slow). Once, the hostess sat us and we seemed to have been forgotten by the 3 waitresses for over 30 min. I finally flagged the manager down. The waitresses didnt know what rotation had us. The heart attack roll is amazing! And I like their Bird Of Paradise martini and love their miso soup!

Amazing! Cant wait to go again. Really great salsa bar, and lots of choices on the menus. Hubby was a bit apprehensive about going but he enjoyed it

Ive been in here 3 times, and just have not had pleasant experiences. The last time we were driving up north (December) and my friend and I wanted to get our caffeine fix. She went ahead of me and ordered a pumpkin spice. The cashier rolled her eyes at her and said they dont make that anymore. So while my friend was deciding on another drink, I ordered my iced white peppermint mocha. I gave her my credit card and then asked for my receipt- she told me she had already thrown it away?!?!?! (they were doing the "come back after 2pm and get another drink for $2). I told her I only wanted it for that and she said, "well you didnt use your gold card so it wouldnt matter anyways." and went to the next person. So I then get my drink that was all wrong. I paid extra to get just a plain HOT mocha. I told them and the barista girl gave me a card for $4 credit towards another drink. I just will not be back to this one every again. The drive thru one just a short distance away is much friendlier and havent messed up my drinks then gave me an attitude about it after.

My husband and I pick up our dinner from here once every 1-2 months. The orange chicken is phenomenal! We also like their House Lo Mein, Egg Drop Soup, crab puffs and they have great lunch combos at awesome prices! The portions are large and we always have leftovers!

I had bought a Groupon for an hour facial and Jenn is AMAZING! Incredibly knowledgeable about every single product, explains what and why shes doing what shes doing to you, great pressure during the facial and very comfortable! I will def be back! She made you feel right at ease right away, and my skin likes her! =)

Can we do a negative star? Co worker ordered a sandwich and it took almost 2 hours! She called twice and the manager David was a total jerk! I was shocked by what I heard him tell her. I def will not order from there again due to how they treated her and neither will another department near us after hearing her waiting for almost 2 hours for 1 sandwich! Never offered a refund or anything
