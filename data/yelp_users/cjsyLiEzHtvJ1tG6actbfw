Not vegetarian. They recently raised their prices again, the food is decent and I use to like coming here, but after this latest price raise I won't be coming here anymore.   The cheese isn't vegetarian and probably never will be...I've gotten bean burros with meat in them when I didn't order it that way...it should be obvious to any vegetarian that this place isn't for you. In any case they just lost a long time customer. I should have stopped sooner, oh well lesson learned.

Not bad! I'm a vegetarian and had the fit fare veggie skillet and it was actually pretty good. I like how it's served on the skillet it's cooked on. I wouldn't say it's the best quality food since it's not organic or anything, but for what it is..not bad! The service and staff were super polite and helpful.

Not vegetarian friendly. I ordered a black bean burger and side salad...the food came out quickly and tasted good until I came to a piece of bacon in my burger and a piece of beef in my salad...wtf? It was so off putting, I won't be visiting Smashburger again a anytime soon. Their fries also aren't vegetarian...They're cooked in beef fat, why is this necessary? Fries can taste just as good cooked in oil. Please catch up with the times Smashburger and make your food healthy.
