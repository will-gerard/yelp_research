Charlotte Marriott city center is a nice hotel located in the perfect part of downtown. They have a decent sports bar and a good restaurant with reasonable "hotel restaurant" prices.  Many decent clubs and high-end restaurants are within walking distance.  The rooms are comfortable with a large desk for working. +lots of plugs  Shower is hot, a good thing, and towels are soft and fresh. (I only mention this because some hotels have a strange chemical smell on their towels after being washed)  Friendly, southern staff

I am in marketing and have an eye for detail and composition. No piece of furniture in the room looks like it goes together. Not by color, not by theme. Well, at least the beds are comfortable, the shower is hot and the towels reasonably soft. A good place for the money.

NEW menu item - Mediterranean Flatbread Sandwich. Includes lean ground beef, marinated onions, tzatziki, feta cheese on warm flatbread. Four, 3-bite pieces are just enough to leave room for a few piping hot frites which also come with this meal. $12.95 is certainly reasonable.  Highly recommend. Ask to be seated in Steven R's section. He's good.  Oh, and maybe some cheese cake for desert. I'll work that off on Camelback Mountain tomorrow.

The Orleans, what can you say?  It's like a mini city inside with a convenience store, bowling alley, movie theater, national chain restaurants (TGIF and Fudruckers + others) and rooms are pretty decent.  NEW and much nicer Carpets in the long hallways and wallpaper are both freshly renovated. The corridors just smell fresh and new.  Rooms Rooms are large and well appointed and they too got the NEW carpeting. Rooms are fresh and clean smelling.  Views Expansive views of the strip and it's dazzling neon lights are seen from the east tower.  Conclusion A fun place with small updates that make this day better.

Hertz is still giving me compact cars for their "mid-size class" rentals. Examples: Corolla, Prius, Matrix. I just want a car that is safer. Nothing more. This week I was on my way to return my compact Corolla and I got hit in the drivers door pretty hard by a Ford F150 Pickup. I got a nice shower of glass and the drivers side door was crushed. Hertz, you need to change your policy. On my next visit, I'll rent full-size class just to make sure I get a real mid-size car.   I still Like the Hertz #1 Club Gold because it saves me time. But I am seriously considering switching rental companies after this accident.  p.s. I know that driving a large car does not equal a safer car. I do know where to go to find out. http://www.iihs.org/ratings. The rating that separates most cars is the rear crash protection/head restraint rating.

Trump Property is beautiful. The lobby and ground floor are decorated with the highest of elegance. Guest services attendants are very well trained, professional and courteous. Rooms are decent sized, clean and well appointed. 5 Stars: After staying at many other hotels while traveling on business in 2015, I've decided to upgrade the Trump Las Vegas to five stars based on the level of service received from the hotel attendants staff and concierge.  Considerations Parking: only valet parking is offered. One of the reasons I stay off the strip when traveling on business is it's can take up to 25 minutes to get your car out of valet. Not often, but sometimes. If you self park, you may have a bit of a walk but at least you can get your car when you need it. Update: Today valet only took five minutes at 7:33 AM  Room view: request a strip view (which is facing south) Love the 58th floor view up Las Vegas Blvd. The view from the 50th floor is pretty good too.  Location: Car access to the hotel is not easy to figure out. I know the streets in Las Vegas pretty well.  Once you're inside none of these are issues  Enjoy your stay.

Breakfast review only - Cold waffles, mushy scrambled eggs, average coffee, uninspiring orange juice. $24.00 plus tax = $25.96 plus tax. That sums up the breakfast buffet.  I've dined here five or six times for breakfast and always ordered off the menu. Stay on the menu. Buffet is a severe disappointment in a hotel this nice.  Service: Servers are friendly and prompt as they should be. My server today was Alma.  Ambiance: Decor is elegant but not over the top for Las Vegas. Color palette is well done but not to my taste. It is more mainstream.  Recommendation: OK for breakfast if you order off the menu.  Tip: Add an Omelet station for eggs made to order as a quick fix for the buffet. You will make many diners happy.

Location: Starbucks is in North Scottsdale off of Scottsdale Road just north of Pinnacle Peak  Size: The store interior small but the staff are always friendly  Outdoor patio: This Starbucks has an outdoor patio adjacent to the door complete with misters to take away some of the summer heat  Recommendation: Go get yourself a delicious drink.

A lab means science and this joint takes coffee to the next level. I learned in Chemistry class that proper measurement yields the best result. Cartel's hand crafted coffee is delightful. And strong. Careful, their brews are pure and robust.  Suggest you give Cartel a try --

Let's face it travelers, most airport food sucks. Not Humble Pie. What's their story? PHOENIX has invited local restaurants to open mini caf√©s by most gates. Humble Pie offers pretty good food selections. And surprise! It's also tasty. Even local micro brews from Four Peeks. Recommend you stop here for a quick meal.
