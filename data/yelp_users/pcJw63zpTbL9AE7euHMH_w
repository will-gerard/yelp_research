My favorite pizza place! The ingredients are always so fresh and the whole staff is kind! I get the white pizza almost every time and it's delicious every single time ! This place never fails. Plus - I love supporting the sweet and hardworking family who owns this place.

Moved in earlier this year and so far we are comfortable here. The maintenance crew's kind and helpful and get the job done. Ellen and Mike are always friendly and understanding and my go-to if I have any issues. We have no real complaints about this place! Would recommend it to anyone - unless you hate ducks and cats roaming around(we love them)!

The noodle bowls taste worse than some instant-noodle I could have gotten at the Asian market. Definitely not going back. 2 stars because the rice bowls were okay.
