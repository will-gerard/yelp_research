Horrible. Don't go to this location. They don't follow the parent company's lead.

If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst customer service experience of my life. They completely defrauded me. I got the wrong sized belt so I wanted to exchange it with one that was slightly bigger. Keep in mind that the item had been purchased the day before and had never been worn. The lady went to the back for like ten minutes - and when she came out she said she couldn't exchange my item because someone had put a hole in my belt to make it even smaller (which doesn't make sense because the belt was too small to begin with). Clearly, she went in the back and put a hole in it herself. Maybe this is how the corporate Gucci office tries to eliminate exchanges and returns.

The food is certainly not authentic Chinese but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. This was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had. The service was spot on. The server visually checked on us every five minutes or so and offered complimentary dessert at the end. Everything was perfectly cooked. All of the vegetables had the perfect amount of crunch to them and the meat was soft and tender.   Try the Double Dragon. It was perfectly cooked -- and just melted in my mouth.

I got the worst hair cut of my life at this place. No joke! I went here because the salon I normally go to wasn't open. The place was right next door, so I thought to myself "well, what's the worst that can happen? How bad can a haircut really get?" The answer to that question become eye-openingly apparent after I left.   As I looked over my hair in my car's mirror, I noticed that they gave me a bowl cut. I looked like Moe in the Three Stooges, perhaps even worse. There was nothing redeeming about it. I had two back-to-back business meetings right after and here I looked like a little twelve year old twerp. The situation bordered on absurdity.   The lady was snickering to herself as she gave me my haircut, so she was probably aware of how horrible it was and enjoying the moment sadistically.  When I went back to ask for a refund, she had the audacity to blame me for the haircut. Apparently I hadn't specified that I didn't want a bowl cut. I guess you have to bring a list of all of the styles of haircuts you don't want.   Maybe the place is good for five year old kids, but if you are an adult steer clear. I repeat, steer clear!

I had a great experience with A1 Garage Door Repair. They have fast, same-day service and they beat all competitor pricing. I wouldn't hesitate recommending them to a friend. Thanks!

Awesome food. Shared three different plates, and they were all perfectly balanced, seasoned, and cooked.
