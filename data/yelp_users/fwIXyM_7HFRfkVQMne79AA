I come here about 4 or 5 times a year. It's consistently good. There is ample seating, so I've never waited long. It's off Central, so the parking is horrid. Their lot holds a good number, but it can be tricky to get in and out when crowded - I don't drive my van here.   I am always pleased with the food. I find the salads ok - I really like their Balsalmic Vinigarette dressing - I'll mop the leftover with bread.  I typically get spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. The sauce has a good flavor.  The Brown Butter with Mizithra Cheese is incredible - but very rich.   The staff is always courteous, and I rarely have to wait for anything.

Professional, friendly and fast. Very customer oriented. I was running late, and they kept the doors open for me top pick up my order after hours. I will use them again and again.

No question, the few times I've eaten here the food was good - good flavor and well done. My complaint is the service is so haphazard. If you can get there when it's not busy, it's great. If you get there when it's busy, it gets a little out of control. As someone else said, there's really no place to wait. I went there this evening, got my name on the list and was told 45 minutes. It was very busy. After about 45 minutes of waiting, I go inside to check how I'm doing on the list. While waiting to check, they sat several couples who just walked in and put their names on the list (I was standing there watching). Then she suggested I would still have quite a wait left. It appeared they were just taking groups as they came in and would only bother to get people outside waiting when there wasn't a line. At an hour, I decided to go elsewhere. This is not the first time it's happened.   It doesn't really matter how good the food is if you can't get to it.

The steaks are generally excellent, although on this last visit the cut of meat in my filet was questionable - it tasted more like liver. The sides were good - I enjoyed the crisp steamed string beans.   The service is absolutely perfect. I had a reservation, and after I arrived, everyone who came to my table used my name.   The location is odd - in an office building with no real pedestrian access. It's so close to the Biltmore area, it seems like that would have been a better location. The decor is professional and befitting the class of restautant.

Someone else said it- this is a traditional diner in every way. The fare is pretty simple and done well. The portions are large and pretty inexpensive.  Three of us had large breakfasts (gut busting - and I can eat pretty big) for $15.   The place was clean and reasonably fast, and the staff friendly.   I'd say it is primarily a breakfast/Lunch place. I'll come back.

I've been going to Shish Kebab House for a long time. We really like it. First off, I like the hummus - it's not too beany or meally. I like the flavor. That's a personal thinkg, though I know. I've not found that many places with hummus that I really like. I find it a lot like the hummus from My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. We always get plenty of Pita - We don't usually finish it all.   I typically order the koobideh and barg combination, and can only eat half. The rest become lunch for the next day. It's almost always really good. I say almost - out of about 20 or 25 trips, one or twice it has been a little dry - obviously not enough to keep me from coming back. The gyro and chicken kebobs are good as well.   I like the rice. A really light rice that complemented the meat well. They put a roasted tomato, but will oftern ask if you want it - I gues most folks don't eat it so they give you the option.   The salad is simple - a few olives, onion and some feta added to a simple lettuce salad. I like the house dressing - a light yogurt dressing.   The location is not the best - a strip mall that gets dumpier as time goes on. The interior is nice and simple. The staff is friendly.

I was traveling for work in Vegas, and I wanted to try something different before my flight out. I found this and decided to try it. It seemed very traditional (or shoud I say authentic?). This seems like the place native japanese would go. Much of the food are items that are not part of the typical American palette. The food was good and the service was good. The biggest challenge was that it was so Japanese that it was hard to understand how and what I was ordering. It would be great to go with a translator.

Good local Thai place. Our favorites are  the coconut milk soup, satay, diver noodles and pad Thai.  Be aware they automatically add 18% gratuity.  And the % for credit or debit is clearly specified in the menu. The decor is done well with Thai highlights. The staff is very friendly and attentive.

I've come in here a number of times - it's a decent salad bar. They have salad options with the bar, and the soups are the best part. The freshly cooked pasta leave something to be desired.    I used to really like it, but I find it harder to keep coming back. The service gets poorer all the time. They used to come around with fresh cookies periodically, but that has completely stopped - they will sell you some. The cashiers and managers are the biggest challenge. I get coupons by email, and every time I go in they refuse to honor them - they add some requirement that doesn't exist on the coupon. Both times I involved a manager, they were smug and blew me off.    With no discounts, the price is pretty high. At $10 for a salad bar, I really would expect something more.

I came to watch a friend's Roller Derby match. The facility looks like it may have been pretty great once, but doesn't appear to have been maintained well. The floos don't seem like they've had a good cleaning in a long time. Everything just seems a little dated and worn out.

La Parilla Suiza is one of my local faves. I probably go there about monthly - sometimes more, sometimes less. The food is great and reasonably proced.   I understand there are several, but I've only been to this one. I like the environment. The kitchen has a large window and you can watch some of the preparation. The wait staff is always very friendly. A few times they've even had mariachis playing table to table.   They use a lot of white cheeses, which I really like. I don't order the typical mexican tacos and enchiladas here, so I can't rate them, but the main entrees are really good. I'm a big fan of the Champignones Suizos - a mushroom and cheese appetizer. I've had the chilaquiles, chicken melt, parillada de pollo, and others, and always like them. I really like the churro beans - it's more of a Pinto soup than the typical refried beans. I've not tried the mole, but my son who likes mole enjoys theirs.   The price is good. I never wait long. The facility is good. The service is great. The food is great. What else can you ask for?

I always have a good meal at this OG.   This trip was no exception. The food is consistent, and the service very courteous.  Our waiter, Jaimon, did a great job. Just the right balance of being helpful without overdoing it.

I've been to a number of shows here, and performed in a couple as well. The theaters are top notch - both front and back of house. The seating is a little close - for tall people like me it's a little rought when someone needs to cross in front of you - but that's nearly the same in every seated venue (a lot like a standard mpvie theater). It seems like every seat is decent.   The only challenge I've had is that sometimes the volunteers can be a bit overzealous.   The other problem is that downtown Mesa is pretty dead when the shows are over. There's nowhere to walk around and get a bite, etc. It's a bit like they roll the sidewalks up. Maybe as the area grows a bit that will change.

I am a big fan of Milano's. In 1975, I traveled to Milano's to get my first horn and got a great deal on a trombone that had been a window display and had some fading. I lived about 3 hours away then. Now I live in W Phoenix, and it's still where I go to buy music (typically materials for students and classes I teach). Their music selection is beyond extensive.  They definitely have the best selection of wind instruments - more models and brands than anyone I know of. Not to mention accessories (l bought an Eastman Case I really like from there). The one shortfall I find is with electronics - I find I go elsewhere for my sound and lighting equipment as the selection seems to be minimal. Probably the best independant store I've been to west of the Mississippi.

Wow. I've never been to such a slow fatburger. I ordered a burger and fries - no one in line, and 1 burger in process ahead of me, and it took more than 30 minutes. I don't think the cook was aware you can start another order while one was on the grill.   The quality was standard Fatburger - it's a chain.   Don't come unless you have lots of time.

I'm impressed with Green. I'm not vegetarian at all, but their fare is substantial and provides a very effective meatless dish with substance. Their meatless chicken wings are really good and have a realistic texture.   The facility is pretty good, and can get crowded at lunch (a good sign I'd think). It definitely has the "green" theme going. They have a pretty decent little vegetarian grocery (a couple of shelf units of stuff near the register) that have things I'm tempted to buy just to try them out.

We really like this particular MBFGR - more so than some of the others we've been to. The food seems to be better - and we're not sure why. The lamb chops in particular are really good. This time we had their platter for two with was on special ($10 off). Wow, 4 people would have been full. It had some of everything on it. The sides are quite good as well - my family in particular all like the lemon potatoes (my daughter has decided that's the best potato dish on earth). The rice and greek salads are great, and they do a good job with the grilled vegetables - just right so they are not too soggy or wilted.

Great burger joint that's reasonably priced (for a large grilled burger)  It's a little pricier than fast food, but it's much more than any fast food burger. They work pretty fast to get the line through and get the orders done. It can be a bit of a cattle chute - but that tends to be part of the atmosphere. They have a large, if pretty standard condiment bar - ketchup, mustard, lettuce, pickles. If you want something beyond that, this is not the place - unless you bring it along.

We go here every few months. There's some great polish food. We've liked everything we've had. It appears to be very authentic (best guess - I've never been to Poland). A few times we've gone in and asked for substitutions - mostly because we didn't know what the dish was and were worried about it - the chef sent word that he felt the original sides were very important to the dish and sent samples for us to try before committing to the substitutes. In each case I ended up enjoying the original and I'm glad the chef encouraged me to try some new things.   The restaurant is small - it's one of the historic houses there, but has a good size patio. The staff seems like they're family members and it gives it a homey feel.

What a nice restaurant. They have good polish food (I notice a lot of european nationals come here - I recognize the languages). They are small inside with 5 tables, and a large patio area (this is the historic Glendale area).   The best part may be the atmosphere. The service is unique. Some places are more ...um, comfortable, than others -this is one. But here it's like visiting family for dinner. Don't be surprised at getting drawn into "intra-table" conversation.   So I've been before. And I'll keep coming back.

I've been coming here for years. They have good food, and really good salsa. I love their chimichanges (for years I've evaluated mexican food restaurants by their chimis). The place is clean and well maintaineed, and the staff very courteous. This place is very popular, and can be busy, but I've always been able to get a table, and they are fast with the food.

I had to be in the area for an evening appointment and had some time, so I looked in the area for restaurants and found the Barrio. The location was in a little rough of an area - I missed it the first time and had to go around the block. It's a couple of spots in an old dumpy strip mall and very small. The parking was deplorable. You have to go around the back to an alley, and spots are cramped and just asking for fender bumps and door scratches. The parking is probably about half the capacity - I'm not sure how they can meet the zoning rules.   Inside the decor was nice - some interesting furniture pieces. It was very crowded - a good sign. I was lucky didn't have to wait long for a table. It seemed like a lot of folks were hanging out - I was there for more than an hour, and didn't see many tables change over.   The menu is unique - but makes it hard to know what you're ordering. I ordered T A C O S  de  C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L - slow roasted pork - the pork was unimpressive. It was a bit mealy - like a lower quality roast. There was a decent amount - no sides. The sauce was interesting and different. I didn't really care for the flavor, but that was my taste. It was a distinctive flavor that I'm sure others would like. I had the choice of fries or a salad - which seemed odd. The salad was the highlight for me. It was a delicious blend of romaine with dried cranberries and queso. The menu was eclectic enough that I would like to try some other items.   The service was ok. The waiter was efficient if not overly helpful. I wasn't ordering a lot or an expensive meal, so it seemed like there wasn't any interest on his part.   The food was pricey for what it was. The quantity was pretty reasonable - I would have preferred one or two less tacos and some sides for a little variety. I might go back, but would need a compelling reason to go to that location and at that price.

This is a gem of a place. I stopped in while at a conference at the hotel around the corner, and was pretty pleasantly surprised. They had some great and different sandwich options. They were very good. The menu isn't extensive, but it seems like they do what they do well. The bakery treats are pretty nice and look quite impressive.   The place is small but also has some outdoor seating which is pretty nice at lunch time in a Chandler "winter."

Always on the slow side. I'd agree with Sott W. - they just don't seen to figure out how to make it work. They are busy, but not effective at all. It can take quite a while to get your food.

I really liked Mango's. The food was good, and the environment was comfortable. I use chimichangas as a test of a Mexican food restaurant. I oredered a shredded beef Chimi, and it was great. The beef had lots of character and the sauce was unique - fruit and vegetable bits inside - I was pleasantly surprised.   The chips were very good - not too greasy. The sauce was alright - a little 'wet' for my taste.    The price was a little higher than I saw in other reviews. You're going to drop pretty close to $10 on any meal here.    All in all, while I may not make a trip just to come here (I live in West Phoenix), I would be happy to eat here if I'm in the area.

I drive by this place pretty regularly, so I decided to stop one day. Soon I took my wife there for lunch, and then she took folks there. I go back periodically. I really like the food here. The tortas are great - and huge. I see people eat the "Rey" and I don't know how they put it away (and I'm a pretty big eater). I've really fallen in love with the quesadilla de maize - a large, corn tortilla based quesadilla. I love their grilled onions and vegetables.   The prices are low. It's pretty easy to get lunch for $5-6, and I only eat half, so get a second meal out of it.   One of the best parts for me, is that the staff generally seems to like being there. One day I was watching an middle aged cook, and it genuinely looked like he enjoyed making the food. The place has the feel of a number of restaurants I've been to in Mexico. Generally clean, but not real high by US standards. The area is ok (a little on the lower economic scale) and there's plenty of parking.

I was very impressed.  I was downtown for jury duty, so I thought I'd find a local place for lunch. Very good-  larger sandwich (easily shared) with lots of good meats, and really good bread.   I had an apparently new sandwich- "Nicole's Bitch-With." Quite good and exactly what I would expect from the girl with a cat hat and packing a snub auto- sassy with a bite.   The sandwiches are just under $8, so plan on at least $10 if you want a drink.

Props to Applebee's on 27th and Bell. I went there for the free Veteran's meal. It was packed but they got me in at the bar right away, and had my meal in front of me within 10 minutes. The whole time Courtney and Kara did an awesome job taking care of us all at the bar. Really great customer service!

The food is good - typical of any Paradise Bakery. Good breads, meats, salads and the cookies.   The facility is great, but parking is horrible.   The reason for the low score is the staff. It seemed like they were all moving under water. The sandwich guy may have been the slowest person I've ever seen. Lethargic would be a good description.

This may well be the best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. The meat was really good and was prepared very well, and the bread was incredible. I had some of their own brew root beer and really liked it. Very rich flavor and full-bodied.   The place is pretty small, and not much room to sit and eat. The staff felt like they were all family and it was very cordial - I felt like they were glad I was there.

Very good sandwiches. It seemed like the ladies making the sandwiches were passionate about their food, and that makes a nice change over so many of the chains. Nice location in old town Scottsdale. I ate at the sidewalk tables, and early spring weather made it great.

I've been looking for a decent prime rib in the area for years with no luck. That's all changed now. I found Lafitte's on Yelp, and was surprised - I had no idea it existed. I'm glad I came though. The prime rib was easily the best prime rib I've had in this part of town, and may be the best prime rib I've had in the under $20 price range in years.   The place seems relatively unknown - it's hidden in the Embassy Suites Hotel. So on a Saturday night it was pretty slow - hardly anyone there. That's really a shame.   The food was very good. It started with the salad. It seemed fresh - it didn't look or feel like it came from a bag. The greens weren't overly cold or wet, and it was arranged nicely on the plate. The bread was a simple sourdough.    We ordered the petite cut, and when our waitress brought out the plate, I was a bit shocked. It was much larger than everyone else's large cut. I could barely eat it - that's saying something. I had the creaole jambalaya as a side. It was tasty with some spice. The sausage was tasty. The vegetables were ok - a mix of squash, colored onions, etc.   The waitress was friendly and courteous, and never let our drinks get empty. The nest part was that two of us ate for less than $35. I'll be back!

This is the place for consuming mass quantities. None of it is really good, but none of it is bad. There's enough variety to make it interesting. There's a lot of space, but the tables get pretty close and it can be awkward moving around at crowded meal times.

Now called Polo's. It's quite a nice surprise in the neighborhood. Very unassuming. But inside they really pull off a good Italian cafe. The really nice touch is Mr Maynes playing some excellent piano on a nice little grand piano.   The food is quite a treat. It's hard to imagine a trained chef in this location, but there you go. He has a unique twist at mixing flavors you wouldn't expect. The salciccia is a great showcase for Italian sausage, and the lasagna is uniquely excellent. And don't forget the cannolis.   I come back regularly.

Came to C&Ws for lunch and had the Prime Time sandwich (see photo) with lobster bisque for an appetizer. Wow. That was a good meal. The lobster bisque was a great meal by itself - big chunks of lobster with a great flavor.   The sandwich was really good. The meat itself was fairly standard, but the combination of the roll, cheese and au jus was perfect. They carry real horseradish which makes a nice topper. They also carry creamy h,  but what's the point? Our server Whitney was great - friendly, helpful and fast. She made sure my glass never got empty and didn't hover too much. Honestly, I'd go back just for her service. The facility is nice - very manly. Dark woods and leather. The music was notable. It was very recent.

I've been here a few times for lunch now. I'm really liking the taces. Every time I try some different meats. So far I've had the fajita tacos, the chicken, beef, the shrimp. I didn't get fish, but my coworker really liked it. I haven't had anything else here, but I am digging the tacos. The feta cheese is a nice touch, and the have regular specials that make a pretty cheap lunch. I'll be back on Tuesdays for Taco Tuesdays and $1 tacos.

Food's decent - staff is generally friendly. The place is a little rough by US standards. Actually, it was a lot like places I went in the middle east in a number of ways. If you're squeamish about sparkling walls and counters, this probably isn't the place for you. If you're willing to overlook a bit to have some traditional middle east food, go for it - you should like it.

Very good, traditional Arizona Mexican food. The restaurant is clean and well decorated (Mexico-style colors) with a very nice landscape mural over a couple of walls (I understand it was a well-known graffiti artist). The tables are 4 person tables that could easily be combined. It's in the strip mall adjacent to the Peoria Theater, and has some room to grow. I can easily see it as the destination after a trip to the theater.   The food was very good, with very large portions. I'm a big eater, but was stuffed with a chimichanga (they come enhilada style). My wife had the carne asada torta and really enjoyed. The rice was unique - not typical of the chili flavored spanish rice in most places, but more of a dirty rice with bits of vegetable, etc. It was very good, and a nice change. For dessert we shared a deep fried cheescake. My wife enjoyed it so much she's bringing a daughter back for the cheescake in a few days for her birthday.   The prices are pretty much in the sub-$10 range for entrees, and the portions are large enough you can take some home for tommorrow's lunch.   So, we're adding this one to the few mexican food restaurants that we frequent.

One of the better local venues - new, nice, clean and not a dump (whose idea was it that music venues had to be dumps). The sound is great. Lights are great.  The stage is high enough everyone can see.  Lounge areas as well as the floor. The couches are a nice touch, but who wants to sit when the band is rockin'? The only drawback is parking. It's in the middle of the night clubs so you are competing with that scene.

Meh. Good sized portions but the meat was nothing special. The pulled pork was moist but it seemed like it was very fatty. The chicken was ok - decent amount. The sauce was pointless - very little flavor. I tried the hot, but it tasted like the mild with a bit of jalapeño juice. The sides looked all store bought. Overall, there's nothing to bring me back.
