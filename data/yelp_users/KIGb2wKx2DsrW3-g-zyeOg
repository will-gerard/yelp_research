I had heard good things about this place from friends and now I am really questioning their palettes! The Pho was very sub par. Not a large portion at all for a $7.95 price tag. They served it with wilted old cilantro and about 12 bean sprouts...no basil. The manager said they were all out of basil in the state of Arizona. The shrimp and pork fried eggrolls for $5.95? Horrible. 3 pieces cut into half served with two small pieces of lettuce and old cilantro and 1 sprig of mint. It's like they don't keep their veggies in a cooler. There is much better Vietnamese food in the city, try Pho Tanh and Maxim, both in central Phoenix.

Best pho I have had in Phoenix. I frequent this place once a week on average and can't seem to stop ordering the #17 beef pho with rare and well done shaved beef and meatball. Their garnishes are usually spot on fresh and abundant, which is key to this dish. I would like to see them off dandelion greens line Pho Tanh down on Camelback but the broth at Maxim is just down right perfect. Rich, beefy flavor with lots of star anise, clove, and fish sauce. All of their spring roll items are terrific, I usually switch off between the fried shrimp and pork version that you wrap in green leaf lettuce and the soft, rice paper ones with the fresh herbs and shrimp. Both are paired with excellent versions of Vietnamese dipping sauces. True, Maxim isn't the prettiest looking place in town but the food and service more than makes up for it.

Nice selection...horrible service. Asked to use bathroom, guy just said no. I said seriously?? He said no...that's it. So instead of spending my money on craft beer in this place, I left. Not coming back..ever.

Thank goodness these nice people opened up this great sandwich shop in the valley. Bite me has by far,the best Philly cheese steak in town.Real shaved rib eye, luscious white American cheese, grilled onions, and whatever else you like on your cheese steaks Sue and her staff are happy to pile it on for you.To the earlier reviewer who said they have bad rolls....do you know what a good one is? Just because those chain shops have 8 different bread choices doesn't mean they know bread, they just have choices.Bite Me's are perfect. Nice and crusty but soft throughout with the perfect bite. All of their sandwiches rock, The Stormin Norman, The Manganaro, heck, even their burger kicks butt.Be sure to check out their daily specials on Facebook also, they never disappoint either. I had a southwestern Reuben there two weeks ago that was so good, it made me question the old school Reuben for superiority. Imagine 1000 island and chipotle mayo had a baby and pastrami took a bath in it. Trust me, for Tempe, Phoenix or even NYC or Philly, this is a great place to get a sandwich. I hear they cater too....

Not much good to say at all about this place. We live in the neighborhood and wanted to give this place a shot. I immediately regretted even walking in the door. Our food was totally flavorless and a horrible value. I ordered the "Hammered Hog" sandwich, which touted a 1/2 pound of our house smoked pulled pork covered with blue cheese cole slaw. My wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich which stated it had a 1/3 pound of pulled pork on it. I swear, their was more meat on hers and mine was a buck more. Not that I would have wanted more meat, it had no flavor except smoke which I'm guessing was liquid smoke. The collard greens side I ordered was so acidic and lacking the long cooking time that this dish needs. I think they might have tasted sour because they had gone bad? My in-laws split a two meat combo and I was embarrassed to take them there. A $70.00 tab for two sandwiches, a split entree plate, one mixed drink and three sodas? Oh, and we ordered a plate of happy hour nachos which were store bought round corn tortilla chips, congealed cheddar cheese, maybe a cup of diced tomatoes and black olives with lackluster sour cream and salsa on the side. Needless to say, we will never go back. I give this place 6 months tops. Whoever thinks this qualifies as good BBQ needs to go to read a recipe and attempt to cook BBQ for the first time ever. I'm almost positive it will come out better.

I would rate zero stars if I was allowed. I had a clogged toilet and had a coupon to use Plumbing Medic to "unclog any clog for $65.00." First technician was two hours late for the job. Without hesitation, took the toilet off and tried to snake it. Immediately said that this was a big problem and needed to get his supervisor out with a camera for a better inspection. After sending the camera down the sewer line they were convinced it was roots in the line, which they believed were located under my son's closet. Within 5 minutes I had a typed, emailed estimate for $3280.00 to jackhammer, dig, cut out, replace main sewer line, etc, and they could start working immediately. I asked if there were any other ways to go about this and was told no, we see this all the time, we know what we are doing, our work is guaranteed, etc.  Got another opinion and they came out and went through our clean out in the front of our house, something Plumbing Medic did not even think of doing. They found a clog, which was a plumbers snake tool in the line and they were able to fish it out and removed some other debris that had built up in the line. There were no evidence whatsoever of roots in the line. They charged me $500.00 and now everything works perfectly.  I'm really just angry that they wouldn't consider any other alternatives to our problem, and went straight to the "big job." Proceed with caution.
