The best dang coffee in town and is my preference for a jolt of caffeine hands down in scottsdale. The chef is amazing and always goes out of her way to say hi and make sure you are happy with your food. If you want good food and a cup of Joe that is good and not the typical corporate burnt Starbucks bean, then try Jolta Java!!

I have been coming to Dr. Sosnow and his awesome staff for years. He worked on my cat who was running through his 9 lives quickly and helped give him live a very long life. All of my animals, and I have plenty of them, have had great care here. I won't go anywhere else and highly recommend them to everyone!

A great break from the norm in Tempe. This place has character unlike many establishments in Tempe these days. It has a great outdoor patio and is in a historic house on campus. The food was yum, and the beers cold!

A great little gem in the middle of silicone and generic places. Great music, vibes and of course, beer. I highly recommend the König Ludwig Weissbier on tap. It is organic and tasty!!

They only have a few good instructors left at this gym, since most have left for better paying gyms. It has gone down the tubes in my opinion. The whole place needs a facelift and the management could care less. The only reason I keep my membership is because of the few teachers left that I love, it is über cheap, and I can use it when I travel. Clean it up...it looks like it came out of the Miami Vice days.

I thought the food was amazing. I had the Voodoo chicken, my husband had the meatloaf sandwich, and my son had the shrimp tacos, all of which were excellent. Very friendly server as well.

I used a groupon for my sessions to this place, and I loved it. I want to keep it up, but it is a little too pricey and just a little too far from me to make it a habit on top of my gym addiction. I went in thinking 30 minutes is not enough, but after my session I had the shakes in my arms...which means...it rocked!

An amazing photographer that does not do the typical or mundane. I have had the honor and privilege to not only work with Chadwick, but also witness the art he produces. If I could have had his eye behind the camera at my wedding I would have jumped on it. You will not be disappointed, I promise!!

A great family owned eatery tucked away in a shopping plaza. We really hope they can make it because the location is hard to find. Hopefully the word will get out, because the food and the owners are awesome!

I LOVE this place!! The owner is so hospitable and makes sure that my vegan diet is accommodated. When I walk in, he knows what I like and even suggests other options and/or makes changes to dishes on the menu and makes it vegan for me. His teas are so yummy, and the crunchy tofu is da bomb. Not sure how someone could give Yoshi Bento a bad review, because we have never once had a bad experience. I guess what you put out, is what you receive.

I have been here once before and found it to be pretentious and too pricey. I decided to return and give it one more chance armed with a Groupon this time. We figured if we use our coupon on a weeknight, how bad could it be. Well, it was pretty bad, because the place was closed. I looked on their website and on Yelp, and neither had correct information on their hours, in fact their own website does not even list hours of operation. Seriously? So, needless to say we drove all the way down there for nothing, and my freaking Groupon expired.   Hello, restaurant 101...tell the customers hours of operation on your website and/or have a message on the house phone. Neither for this place. Makes me wonder if it is still in business considering the way it looked inside, but who knows, because you cannot find out any accurate information anywhere. : (

Love me some Vee and some Hair Nirvana! I walked into his very zen store to check out the very cool items one day not knowing that behind the colorful gifts in the store front, would be an even more colorful owner and amazing stylist. He not only offers items from his tribe, but also items that are conscientious and handmade. Vee gives back to his community like no one I know. Everything he does comes from compassion and his big old heart.   Not sure what ill will Catherine P. has towards Vee, but it is obviously stemmed in hate and not representative of the true person he is.   My son and I give him 100 stars...and look forward to seeing his shiny, happy self every haircut. We also look forward to his annual feeding the homeless in Phoenix during the holidays. It has become a highlight during the holidays for our family.

I love this place...for introducing me to Dazzle Dry, all natural nail polish! It is the best invention ever, and locally owned too!! I am allergic to formaldehyde, plus never wanted to ruin my nails with gels. This stuff makes your nails healthy, yet acts as a gel without all the harsh chemicals. I wish I could review the lashes, but I have never tried those. I have however seen the clients and they look fabulous...not like bats, like many women walking around Scottsdale.   I love that this place is family owned and run. Great vibe!

Great restaurant with yummy, healthy eats. Have been coming to Pita Jungle since its early days in Tempe, and love that they have expanded to other areas. This new location is special because of the owners. They have a local rock and roll connection and are super nice guys!   I know that this place will do well, and wish everyone all the success they deserve!
