My husband and I went there for our friends birthday dinner. The food wasn't that great and the salad looked like it was from one of those salad bags that you can get at a grocery store. Our waiter was very nice, but the food wasn't so great. I think Olive Garden is better than this.

I love Target! I went to this Target in Glendale because I was visiting my parents and I had a mobile Target coupon, buy one get on free accessories, jewelry, or watch and I must say I got a SUPER great deal. I got some earrings on clearance for $2.38 and got a $49.99 watch for FREE! My total after tax was $2.60! I thought I would've had a problem because it took the most expensive item off, but the cashier who cashed me out was super nice and said that it was valid and corporate knew an started a little conversation with me. KUDOS Target for the great customer service!   I have it a 4 out of 5 because they didn't have a variety of watches to choose from, but the customer service was great!

I've been here plenty of times for the past few years for wedding receptions, dim sum and of course MY wedding reception.  We came here last night for a wedding reception and we LOVE the food here. The seafood appetizer and the seafood soup to start are delicious. The seafood platter includes, Jelly Fish (YUM), Seaweed Salad, Squid and a few other items. It looks a little weird, but it's very tasteful. The soup was GREAT, it had great taste to it. For entrees we had, stir fried crabs (LOVE LOVE LOVE!), a whole roasted chicken, whole roasted duck, stir fry beef and Chinese broccoli, a whole steamed catfish, pork fried rice, and fried quail. Everything was delicious. I never really liked quail, it just looks unappetizing. My husband insisted I try just a little piece cause he said it taste just like chicken so I thought why not try just a small piece. I must admit it did taste like chicken but it was a little too salty for me.   I highly recommend this place if you're looking for some real authentic Chinese food. Dim sum is great as well!

This is one of the best buffets in Vegas. If your a seafood lover like my husband and I the price you pay is so worth it.   They have crab legs, served steamed or cold, lobster tails, raw oysters, crawfish, clams, mussels .... The clam chowder is a must have and of course there's non seafood items too like the beef ribs which is so moist and it falls right off the bone.   Here's a Tip: I do recommend stopping by the half price ticket counters that you see on the strip to save $11 at the buffet.

My husband and I used to go here a lot, but under new management and different workers, the food just isn't that great anymore.

A little family owned market that's been around for over 10 years. Everything is pricey, but that's what you pay when you need something quick and not too far.   I usually get the rotisserie chicken or the hot wings there. The rotisserie chicken can sometimes be too salty, just depends which cook is cooking that day. The hot wings are decent, falls right off the bone, but could use more flavors.

My husband and I came here for dinner on Valentine's Day. The place was packed , but I'm pretty sure every where else too. Thank goodness my husband had made prior reservations earlier that week because they weren't doing any walk-ins.   To start, we ordered white fish and salmon sushimi and the Las Vegas roll. I don't like raw fish, but my husband does and he said the sushimis were good. The Las Vegas roll ... Let's just say I've had better. Don't think I'll be ordering that there anymore. For our teppanaki meal, I ordered the New York steak and chicken and my husband had the New York steak and shrimp. We were also served miso soup, salad with ginger dressing and also shrimp appetizer.   Our chef was funny and very talkative. That was a good thing because we were sitting with 8 other people who we didn't know, so he broke the ice because afterwards we all started talking, which was nice.   Our total bill was $110 not including tip, but I thought it was well worth it. I'd come back again for sure.

This isn't one of the best buffets I've had in Vegas, but I play the My Vegas Slots game on my phone and earned enough gold coins to get a buy one get one free pass at the More buffet inside Luxor. My husband and I went during lunch and it was a disappointment. There wasn't that many options so I don't even know why it's even called "More Buffet". I guess I can't really complain because my husband and I only paid $10 each, thanks to my Vegas slots!

Food is delicious! I choose the 2 meat lunch meal and had the catfish and beef brisket with beans and it also came with corn bread. To top it off our waitress was sooo nice. She always made sure we were doing okay.

This last trip to hooters just reminds me as to why I never want to come here. We came here because my brother in law came into town and he wanted do the all you can eat wings for $12.99 on Wednesdays. The wings take forrrrrreeeevvveerrr to come out, the first batch we got didn't come out til 30 min later after we ordered, so as soon as we got our first order we decided to place our next order since it takes a lifetime to get. The second batch came out within 15 minutes, but of course they got our orders wrong so we had to wait another 15 minutes for the right ones to come out. During this time we just didn't feel like eating anymore, the food just took wayyyy too long to come out.

My husband actually saw this restaurant on the Food Network channel and wanted to try this while we were vacationing in Vegas, so we mapped it and tried it out.  The owner/waitress was wayyy too kind! She said 2 things they don't mess with "money or food" and boy was she right. I ordered a small bowl of pho #22 and my husband ordered a medium sized bowl of pho #22. The small bowl of pho was more like a medium sized bowl and the medium sized bowl was like a large. The pho broth had so much flavor that you really didn't need to add much of the hoisin sauce or Siracha sauce to it.   2 bowls of pho (1 small & 1 medium), spring rolls, and iced coffee came out to be almost $50! That was some expensive pho. We're just not used to that in Arizona, but then again we were in Vegas so we expected it. We'll definitely go again the next time we're in Vegas.

I came here yesterday for the first time and I was highly disappointed. The wait was too long and my Ever Green SMOOTHIE was wayyy too watery. I told one of the workers and she told me to wait and that she'll make me another one and it took about 15 minutes before I got my drink. Maybe next time I'll try something else besides a smoothie.

I stopped here after dropping off a package at the post office, which was next door and let me tell you ... This place is a RIP OFF! I got a single scoop of vanilla ice cream on a regular cone and paid $3.60! That's outrageous! That'll be the first and LAST time I'll be getting ice cream from there.

One of the best buffets in town!   Dinner on a Saturday night is $26.95 per person, kinda like Vegas buffet prices. I thought it was worth it. They had king crab legs, lobster claws, clams, mussels, raw oysters, prime rib, a variety of Asian foods, pizza, etc. I like how they are able to warm up the seafood for us because some places don't. There's also a bar inside, so if anyone feels like they need a cocktail or two they are able to just walk up to the bar. The view wasn't so bad either. We had a table next to the window and we were able to catch the sunset.   If you do plan to go, arrive early or you'll be stuck in a looooooong line. The wait was worth it though!   Happy eating!

I heard great things about this place, so I figured I should try it out. They had hot dogs, sausages, chicken sandwiches, ect... I ordered the spicy Italian sausage with tomatoes and pickles and I must say it was delicious! I really liked the bun was different but different good. My cousin had the chili cheese dog and he said that was delicious, he devoured that within a few minutes. I highly recommend this place and I'll be a returning customer for sure.

The food here is alright. Never really was a big fan of BBW, but my cousin wanted to eat here because of the wing special they have on Thursdays, 60cents for boneless wings. It's a little too pricey for boneless wings I must say. I had the parmesan garlic wings and the chicken 'burlitos', which basically was a soft chicken taco. I don't recommend the parmesan garlic wings, it's wayyyy too saucy and the chicken burlitos was a disappointment.   The only good thing about this place is that there's plenty of TV's to watch any sports game.

I've wanted to try this place out for a while since it's down the street from where I live. I finally came here this past weekend with my sisters and I must say I wasn't too disappointed.  I had the Farmer's Market, which was an Egg Benedict, topped with a poached egg, avocado, tomato, spinach and of course the hollandaise sauce, plus a side of potatoes. I thought that it was good the only thing I didn't like was that my meal was drenched in the hollandaise sauce. It was just too much for me.  My sister ordered the French Toast with Whipped Cream and Strawberries and BOYYYYYYY did it look & tasted AMAZING!   If anyone is around the Mill Ave area, you should definitely try this place out!

I wish there was one here in Arizona!   My husband and I came here with our family and friends for lunch while vacationing in Vegas. We arrived around 11:30am and there was already a whole bunch of people waiting to get in, mind you this place does not open til' 12pm.   My husband and I ordered 2 pounds of shrimp, the whole sha-bang medium, 1 pound of crawfish, the whole sha-bang XXX spicy and an order of rice.   It's never a disappointment when we come here!

I heard really good things about this place so after a hike up "A" mountain with my sister, we decided to try it out. Both of us were first timers and it took us awhile to decide what we wanted because everything on the menu sounded so good.   We both ordered the Traditional Burrito with chicken sausage and my sister added avocado to hers. We took our order to go. We unwrapped our burrito and couldn't wait to take a bite ...  Now for the 2 stars .... I took a bite into mines and there was a string of hair hanging out from it. Yup, I was really really disappointed. My sister however enjoyed hers.   Would I try this place again? Possibly, we'll see.

A hidden GEM! This is the BEST Thai restaurants in Arizona.   My husband ordered the Seafood Combo Hot Pot and I ordered the Chicken Pad-See-Yew and both dishes are to die for. The combination of all the herb and spices are perfect.   The staff is wonderful, always welcoming and friendly!

My husband and I went here today because we had heard about this new Ramen Noodle house that just opened up the past weekend and we were SO disappointed. It's WAY overpriced for the amount of noodles you get and on top of that you have to pay extra for toppings! $1 for 1 boiled egg, $1.50 for barely a handful of chicken AND .25cents for how spicy you want the soup to be. Definitely won't be going here anymore.

My husband and I were looking for a new pho spot to try out nearby and happened to find this place.   We walked in and the waitress just looked at us and sat us down at a table, she didn't greet us or anything. Once we sat down she came by to give us the menu and the menu was for Thai food. We could have sworn we walked into a pho restaurant because the picture outside clearly stated it was a pho restaurant. Anyway, we just sat there for about 10 minutes while our waitress was eating with another worker. She then came by and asked what we wanted to drink and we asked if there was pho here. She didn't say anything but take our "Thai" menus away and came back with the Vietnamese menu. To sum things up .... She never came back to take our order after that, so we left.   Boooo ... Customer Service was terrible! I'll never recommend this place to anyone!

I've been coming here for about 7/8 years now and it's one of the BEST Chinese restaurants in Tempe. It's affordable and the amount of food you get is so worth it. I always get the Hunan Special Chicken and it's never a disappointment. The house fried rice is good too as well as the crab puffs. The couple that owns it is so friendly! They know my family and I because we're loyal customers and every time we go in with the kids they always give us a big bag of fortune cookies, who can say no to that?!

Food is great and customer service is exceptional. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and the only thing that needs a little more flavor is the dipping sauce for the spring rolls, but other than that everything is great!

I decided to come back here to try other dishes and I must say I was NOT disappointed. This time was better than the first time.  This time I had the Spicy Beef hot pot, which I absolutely LOVE. I actually prefer this than the Seafood hot pot. It has more flavor and the spice level was on point. We also ordered the Lamb, Chicken, and Beef skewer, let's say with every bite you have a burst of delicious flavor in your mouth. I highly recommend it!

After lunch with my family, we wanted to get something sweet. We were gonna go to Slickables like we always do for some ice cream, but I remembered driving by this palace and always wanted to stop by. I checked in on Yelp, like I always do when I go somewhere and they had a deal, $10 for $20 worth of goodies, so I thought why not that's a SUPER deal. My cousin and I split the voucher so we each paid $5 for $10 worth of goodies. I got some sugar free chocolates, which also happened to be 25% off, coconut caramel candy apple, which was 50% off, a bottle of water, a bag of honey roasted peanuts, a cup of gelato, and 2 packs of pop rocks. The candy apple was DELISH! They also had home made fudge, different varieties and the good thing was that we were able to sample all of them! I recommend the Rasberry Swirl, that was pretty good. If your looking for some good gelato, try the mango! I also like the fact that they had unique drinks and chocolate. They had bacon soda to beef jerky chocolate, I don't know if I would ever try them, but I know someone out there would!
