Tonight, five of us went to our first First Monday seminar at the Burton Barr Central Library with fine art photographer (Roger Palmenberg) . The seminar was fun. Being able to walk to our destination...Cheuvront Restaurant & Wine Bar (I googled them) was perfect. You don't have to fight for a seat on a Monday night! The proprieter and two great guys helped us put together tables for 15 of us. Others came over that we met at the Library. We were a half hour early for the Reverse Happy Hour that starts at 9. Dang it. So my delish chocolate mint martini was $10 and not $7. The service was good. Sitting and visiting just felt comfortable.   Our group of five decided to order all five desserts so we could try everything! We ordered creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, lemon tart, pumpkin bread pudding and coconut cream pie. We all had so much fun trying so many different things, that was what made the experience fun! I told them I was going to do my first review on here and we had even more fun voting for our favorites! With 3 votes, the winner was PUMPKIN BREAD PUDDING. It was heaven. With 2 votes, second place went to the coconut cream pie. The others were just ok.  But it was the combined seminar/restaurant experience with friends that made the evening unique and thus, special.

I don't put five stars down for anybody.   However, the Rokerij is number one in my book.   I love their apps!! I love it when you can find a place and you KNOW you love their food. Some have boring, conservative menus, like....well, I shouldn't say, but there's one on the SE corner of Camelback and 32nd.   But the Rokerij has blue crab mini tostadas that surprise your mouth with their freshness, cold lettuce (it hasn't wilted on the way downstairs to the basement from the kitchen) and it's a snack, not a meal. So, you can taste four appetizers and enjoy tasting your favorites or finding new ones and not spend lots of money just getting full on one thing.  They say the Rokerij basement is a cell-free zone. That's because as you descend each slate/rock step downwards, right off the wood front deck, the signal mostly won't go through! So, you can get in your uninterrupted girl talk or romantic moments with someone you want to be one-on-one with. I love the wood beams, the hammered copper bar, the leather furniture, the stone walls and the intimate fireplace. It's dark. And it feels good.  I usually get those blue crab tostadas, shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops and the ceviche. But then, wouldn't you know, someone told me about a new favorite, steak tacos! Huh? I don't eat beef. Sort of. Bye bye ceviche!  And the insider's secret that I will hate you for if you take my place at the bar (the offer is good at both the upstairs and downstairs bars...I just called to make sure the details were right), is that if you are sitting at the bar and order certain apps BEFORE THEIR clock strikes 6 pm, (4-5:59 pm on THEIR clock, very important),   THEY ARE $5 EACH!   Some don't get discounted. But my favs do!   Tell them Roseann sent ya. They just learned I can have fun. I've been goin since they opened. I guess I just don't drink enough alcohol for them to see the fun side. Oh well. What can I say? Hangovers just don't cut it anymore. Although, the more car bombs you have, the more you can forget that. I learned. Again. Two weeks ago.

Free outdoor night concerts, with great local bands in Scottsdale make a perfect finish to a weekend in May and June!   Arizona needs more free outdoor music venues!! They're such a great escape from what is a hot asphalt city by day.   I think the park is so smart. They water the grass beforehand to cool down the temperature at least 10 degrees. You notice when you walk out that the temperature is 10 degrees warmer as soon as you leave the concert area and head toward the parking lots.  One more concert left before the end of the 2010 May 2nd - July 4th season is this coming Sunday, July 4th, with Furious George. There's a rumor they're going to have fireworks. The music plays from 7:30-9 pm.  Take a listen:  http://www.furiousgeorgeband.com/ .  Tonight's band was Cold Shott & The Hurricane Horns.  Here's one of their tunes: http://www.youtube.com/rbrydle#p/f/3/U809HhrgS40 .  They're much better LIVE!   Tonight was girls' night out. We ate at Malee's on Main beforehand on a Groupon $40 gift certificate (cost $20), so we were full by the time we got there. We brought beverages and staked out a spot with a blanket and chairs. Then we walked around, while it was still daylight and visited with people. It was so much fun. We spotted a dog that looked like a lion in profile. We asked the couple who owned him what kind of dog he was and his name. He's a Chow Chow and his name is Simba.   A group from SYSCO Foods was having a picnic. They shared you can reserve a two picnic table ramada for $25 and pay $5 for a beer permit. But the ramada is on stone and dirt and not as cool and fun as the grass and blankets.  June 6th was my first chance to go this year, when they had the Groove Merchants. The music was great. We got there around 6:45, so we had time to find a parking spot and find a nice, uncrowded grassy area to spread out our chairs and blanket on. If you want space without kids and people walking too close, spread out a blanket in front of your chairs. You can stretch out your legs and have room for your goodies and to stand up and dance to the music.  The Groove Merchants concert was a date night. It really helps you get to know someone when you are packing in chairs, a blanket, coolers and picking food and drink together to bring.   Hopefully, you get consulted or you ask the person going with you what they'd like. Dates who don't ask what you want? Unless they know your taste, if they don't ask what you like, speak up and tell them. If they continually don't ask what you'd like on other dates, too, take note. If you give them a chance to please you, they probably will. :) And, if you go out of your way to do something special for them, too, you'll make a heck of a duo, if you don't already!  To find next year's McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park concert schedule: http://therailroadpark.com/events.htm . It may not be posted until closer to next season.   PS Kids and parents were taking a mini train around the park during the concert. I've never felt drawn to that activity. Maybe if the Monkee's were playing. :)   They sell neon bracelets/necklaces that seem to create competitions for parents to construct the best baseball hats, bracelets and crowns for their kids to run around in. Maybe it's so they can find them in the dark. The kid play area seems to all be on the right side of the stage, so if you stay left or toward the back, you'll have a pretty kid-free night.

I've been bringing friends to this neighborhood find for years and only today learned it's not Via de los Santos! It's named after the owner, Delosantos.   I went to Sunnyslope High School, so this is my old 'hood.   If you like a place that's cozy and funky with nice staff and tasty Mexican food, go here! I asked our server whether she recommended the chicken or the shrimp fajitas, since I love veggies and chicken or fish. She recommended the shrimp. ($11.95)  Wow! I ate the whole plate...which should have been enough to have a small plate for leftovers. But no-oh! It was too addicting to not devour it fresh off the grill. Whatever they spread on the shrimp? I was in heaven.  The chips are decent. The chunky salsa was tasty. When I asked for a spicy bloody merry with a garden, they did put in two olives (no celery) and the server came back to ask if it was spicy enough. Nice, right?  It was yummy.   They have $3 house margaritas all day, every day. And 200 tequilas, which I can't report on because tequila gives me a hangover before I go to bed. And I hate hangovers. Just like you.  It's located just north of Dunlap on Central, on the west side. If you can't park in the lot, park on the side street.  Enjoy!

AZ88 is a slice of heaven: Listening to jazz on the patio overlooking the lawns at Scottsdale Civic Center with a tasty foamy latte on a beautiful 83 degree February afternoon. It was the perfect place to stop and smell the roses. I was here for a Valentine's Day TV interview only steps away by the LOVE sculpture and looking for where to meet one of my gorgeous single girlfriends for some girl talk about men.  I looked in on another place on the walk over but it felt too dark and industrial, though the people inside seemed friendly.   The patio at AZ88 is like a work of art itself. Smart design.   I was hoping my shrimp and spicy slaw would rock my world with moist deliciousness, but while my sinuses opened up, it was a tad dry and underwhelming. But it only barely affects my high from the ambiance and the beautiful Arizona day. There are worse things than a salad that is still better than anything I can whip up, sitting and enjoying great conversation on our cozy private white sofas.

I don't get how Bomberos stays in business.   I met a girlfriend there for the first time last night. The hostess stand blocks you from walking comfortably into the courtyard. I noticed it as the first of many signs they are not here to serve their clientele. The hostess said I could look for my girlfriend. She didn't think she was there and it almost felt like she was hesitant to "let" me look and see if she was inside. I saw my girlfriend and her boyfriend and sat with them on these nice, black leather facing sofas, when soon after my Coca Cola Light arrived, a girl informed us she'd like us to move to the only table inside in front of the bright sun (setting through the frosted glass, the temperature was at least 10 degrees warmer there). I asked how about this 3 top in the shade that no one was sitting at, next to another set of facing black sofas. But no. That was reserved.   Remember Wolfgang Puck's Obachine? They used to have a waiting line and act like the upstairs at Biltmore Fashion Park was packed. You'd get inside and it would be nearly empty. Look where that restaurant is now. Not in Phoenix.  When we saw they could not find a comfortable, cool place for us to sit, we asked for the check and asked them to take off the Coca Cola Light they really hadn't given me time to get more than two sips out of. They balked. We had to ask the manager to take it off.   Things improved when we walked across the street to Corbin's. If you're looking for a place with excellent customer service, a full bar (I didn't know Bomberos had only beer and wine) and awesome, very fresh ahi tuna on a crispy wonton, you may want to turn south to the Corbin's lot, when you see it and skip Bomberos.   The hostess at Corbin's jumped up to help when we saw the bar seats were full and asked us where we wanted to sit. The place had a good energy, which was a nice switch!  I thought Bomberos might be neat because I live just a few miles away. They did have a large patio, but it was July at 5:30 pm. Not the place to cool down.  It looks like Corbin's and Via delosantos are the only winners near Central and Dunlap.

Does the matchmaking get better or worse, the more Guinness you drink? Lis Doon Varna, named after the Irish town famous for its annual matchmaking festival, celebrates its long awaited Grand Opening tomorrow, THURDSAY, September 18th  A funny thing happened on the way home from the beating the Arizona Cardinals gave the Miami Dolphins last Sunday. A new certified Guinness Irish Pub, called Lis Doon Varna, named after the town in Ireland with a popular matchmaking festival, finally opened. It took five years to build, from conception, Mike Garcia, the GM said. It was supposed to be open by the Super Bowl.  The reason it took so long to build is the furniture is all from Ireland. There's great attention to detail in the construction. Down to the floor tiles and the window to the mock children's sleeping quarters, upstairs. They designed the exterior to look like a town, with the thatched roof and storefronts.  They're proud to be serving their 20 oz Imperial Pints at the perfect temperature and the perfect specifications by Guinness. It takes 102 seconds to pour the perfect pint.  It just so happens, I was with Steve, the ultimate Guinness critic. There isn't an Irish Pub that goes by without Steve's truck getting sucked into the parking lot. Most recently, the James Joyce in Santa Barbara and Rosie McCaffrey's in Phoenix to hear Chrystal Baker and The Waters, who we love. I can talk music. Steve can talk Guinness. You'll have to ask him about the Guinness at those places. I'm trying to get him to Yelp.  I do know Sunday, Steve was a happy man. He said, sounding like a pretentious wine critic, "The Guinness is spectacular! Extra cold. Not one tint of bitterness. Smooth."   Why wouldn't it be? Mike said they built the whole Pub around the tap system, which is made of solid brass, "the largest in the nation."  They had a soft opening, which is why you've already seen reviews. We had wings. They were meaty and not over or undercooked. And tasty. The celery was crisp and cold. The ranch and wings sauce were both really good. They're paying attention to the food. We saw a huge thing called a boxty go by to another table. They raved about it and the macaroni and cheese. Turns out the boxty is "similar to a crepe or tortilla or potato pancake, cooked on a griddle, stuffed with fillngs and rolled." It looked big enough to feed a family of five.  What I learned was that Lis Doon Varna is named after the town Lisdoonvarna that holds an annual matchmaking festival. Being a matchmaker, I had no idea Guinness was gonna bring me to anything related to my profession! They had a matchmakers' booth, where the elders in the town would sit with someone and make a match.   I loved the interior. Take a walk around when you go. There's many rooms, lots of hard wood, the best booths I've seen, a stage with a 200 year old organ and of course, lots of Guinness and Irish Whiskey.  Mike said their highest selling beer is Guinness. Unlike others who claim they are Irish Pubs whose best seller is Bud Light.  The Grand Opening of Lis Doon Varna is tomorrow, THURSDAY, September 18th, 2008. If you LOVE a PERFECTLY POURED GUINESS, a decent selection of Irish Whiskey, live Irish music, huge proportions of tasty food in an ambiance reminiscent of old Ireland, then go join the fun. Just bring the number for a taxi.  They have a schedule of events and information on the story of how Lis Doon Varna got its name on their Website. I just looked it up. They have toasting contests during the day and if you win, you get to say them later that evening up on the stage.   So, you're telling me folks drinkin' Guinness are supposed to be able to speak coherently after hours of drinking, waiting for their turn at the mike? I thought Guinness was supposed to be a strong lubricant. It's THURSDAY. Are they tellin' us folks are taking the day off?  I'm writing this from a convention in Austin, TX, when I should be down having my own toddy in the bar. I won't see you there, but I'll be thinkin of ya.   I wonder. The more Guinness they pour, do the matches they make get better or just more plentiful?  PS We did notice one negative. The server was super friendly, but they left the dirty plates and napkins in front of us on the table instead of picking them up when we were done. After wings, you can get one heck of a messy stack of napkins.

I had an unbelievably delicious AND healthy meal tonight at True Food Kitchen: SUSTAINABLE STEELHEAD* Smoked Onion Tabbouleh, Arugula, Golden Beet & Cilantro Pumpkin Seed Pesto. I'm new to eating healthy and cooking healthy. I'd love to get the recipe for this meal...are you listening True Foods?   I like scrumptious or spicy food over bland. The lemon whatever they tossed the arugula in was unexpectedly yummy and addicting. The trout was moist, delicious and pretty! :-) The tabbouleh was plentiful and made me full by the time I finished scooping up every morsel. I'm now officially glad there's a True Foods closer by at the Biltmore.   The first time I went to a True Foods, I had a salad that looked like they just arranged all the prettiest raw veggies from the farmer's market they could find and crammed them into a bowl. It looked like art but it also felt like I was just eating from the produce section. It was boring. It had no taste. But I care more about healthy eating now than I did that first visit.   If other items on their menu are this tasty, True Foods and I are going to become close.   I recommend restaurants to my high end matchmaking clients all the time. I like that you can go for a walk after dinner and hold hands window shopping or go for an after dinner drink at one of the many nice places at both TF locales... Biltmore Fashion Park and Scottsdale Quarter.

I was recommended to Andrew Bailin at Markit Media by APS/AAAME CEO Class 15 classmate Jean-Luc Le Provost. They just printed his awesome new 2-sided 4-color business cards for a smokin' deal and they looked great!   I called to get pricing. I wanted recommendations to get a business card with a luxury feel and look. Andrew was super helpful with ideas (he always is) and optimistic he could deliver. He's always upbeat. I don't think he has a bad day.  He suggested I come in and take a look at samples. He showed me card stocks, rounded and square corners, silk and spot UV so I could see the differences. After a short meeting, I'd ordered 2,500 stylin' cards for less than 9 cents each. My last cards cost 33 cents each. Boy, has printing changed.  They have convenient parking right in front, a block from Camelback and Scottsdale Rd and they're open Til 6 pm.  Thanks for the great service, MARKIT MEDIA! Here's their number: 480-245-4287  I'll be back. Roseann Higgins President SPIES Single Professional Introductions for the Especially Selective
