I am finally going to write a coherent review that does not labor with ramblings before the actual review. One that succinctly gets to the point and does not meander through the muddy waters of trying to come up with an anecdote that gets the point across without actually delving into a review of the actual place. Oh damn, I've done it again. Here goes...  What can I say Mr. Thomas, not sure if that is his real name, you do a very good job.  I have taken numerous shirts and trousers to him and he makes sure that they fit according to my specifications. Examples: Shirt sleeves shortened and darts added so that it fits closer to the body. Trousers hemmed, tapered, and the seat taken in so it is not baggy.  It can be expensive, depending on what kind of work you are getting done, but the workmanship is excellent. I would definitely recommend this tailor.

Dismal, abject, revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can, or a snuff film. You know nice, pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards.   I was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.  I would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in... Just not at Shogun.

Went for the first time last week.  Pretty much an awesome place.  The 'Blob' exhibit and the 'Firefly' room are trippy and lots of fun.  Cool place to hang out if your looking for a mellow day activity or maybe even an artsy date.

Returned on 8/15/09. Still as cool as always. There were a lot of the same exhibits, guessing it's the museum's collection. However, there were some new and exciting additions. In particular, the low rider on display as part of the post-chicano movement art scene.  The new items for this series were every cool and were stepped in graffiti culture. There is also a new collection of watercolors that is amazing because of the scale of the paintings.

There are only so many ways one can describe the glistening, slightly sweet, luscious, and deeply satisfying broth at Da VÃ ng. What more can be said on the matter? I shall try, but will most certainly fall well short.  I know it takes hours of first roasting, then gentle simmering of beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices to get that complex, layered, richly verdant bowl of delight. Steam slowly rising off its surface as you lower the vegetable accoutrements into its golden embrace.  Could you go somewhere else for pho? Sure.  Are there better bowls of pho out there? I'm sure there are.  But we're in Phoenix, so why would you?  Best pho I've had in Phoenix. Period.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in...

The Lisbon Lions.  If you know anything about Celtic FC, then you should know about the Lisbon Lions. The year was 1967; the setting Lisbon, Portugal.  The green half of Glasgow wins the European Cup, now the Champions League.  A shining moment of glory for the Scottish club that plays second fiddle to its blue neighbor, Rangers FC; the most decorated club in the world.  And arguably the better half of Glasgow.  As of my last visit to Mrs. McCaffrey's, I did not see a photo of the storied Lisbon Lions on the wall, but perhaps I did not look hard enough.  Beer goggles are not the best detective eyewear.  Still, the atmosphere is cozy; and as for Celtic FC kit, there is enough to go around.  Beer; as a pub this is a prerequisite, and Rosie's does not disappoint.  The selection is pretty standard, but does have Hoegaarden; very nice.  The whiskey lineup is made up of the usual suspects, but when it comes to getting pissed it works like a charm.  The service is quick and friendly, so nothing to complain about there.  The victuals are quality, and if I might recommend the meatloaf sandwich.  I'm not a big supporter of meatloaf, but this particular dish was quite good.  Curry chips were excellent, although the chips could have been bigger.    So, if you like Irish pubs with a penchant for Scottish football, then Rosie McCaffrey's is the place for you.  I have a feeling that Americans don't realize that Celtic FC is a Scottish club.  Sod it, ignorance is bliss, and a place to get proper pissed should never go amiss.  It's just a shame that there are not more Scottish pubs; I would love a Rangers pub.  Maybe there is a gap in the market.  Cheers Until then, get the beers in...

It was dark, the music was loud, I was drunk, I danced. Fun times.   Funnily enough it reminded me of something like a Bam Margera party basement the way it was decorated, or that movie where the college kids go to Europe on holiday and they end up in some creepy Eastern-block transit house designed to torture and murder helpless, innocent, travelers in order to extortion American dollars out of their unwitting parents.  No wait, more like the first example.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in...

First time to DC Ranch.  This place is pretty awesome.  Nice decor, a lot of the indoor tables were reserved, not sure why, but that's ok, the patio is cool too.  Our waitress, Amanda, gave some great recomendations.  We went with a couple of the wine "flights".  Basically three wines that compliment each other; different region, country, terroir, whatever.  Good deal for someone who is not too versed on wines, and wants to taste different wines without blowing the rent.  We went with the World Red and the World Pinot Noir; both were really excellent and went well with the Prime Rib Sliders and the Baked Chevre in Marinara.  Overall, I would definetly go back, plus there are lots of other great places in the DC Ranch area.  Cheers Until then, get the beers in...

So far I have had the Napoli and the Roma.  Both very good pizzas; the Roma if you like anchovies.  Good football clubs as well.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in...

The food is extremely bland and overcooked. Healthy can be flavorful, tantalizing, and delicious, but the dishes here lack inspiration.   The rice and noodles in the dishes are overcooked. The vegetables are edible, but lack seasoning. The dishes feel forced and put together in a rush without any creativity behind their creation.  Yes, Grabbagreen has smoothies too. I tried one, the experience was better, but still far from the best I've had. The berry smoothie tasted oddly like artificial grape flavoring.  The driving feeling I took away from my meal here, is that the dishes were created by someone who has been removed from a real wholesome meal for far too long and believes, wrongly, that these abominations pass as a fulfilling meal.
