I just left the Sally Beauty North Scottsdale location and am incredibly frustrated with the experince.  I drove 30 miles to get there today to use my birthday coupon ($10 off $20 purchase) that expires today.  After spending 45 minutes in the store, asking numerous questions that the empoyees could not answer, I get to the register and go to pay for my $40 purchase with an American Express gift card, and they would not allow me to use it becaue my last name is not the same as my husband's (never legally changed my name).  The card has his last name on it.  I have never had a problem anywhere else using these gift cards and do so all the time.  I had several other cards with me that have my name with the same last name as his and still they would not accept it.  I asked to speak to a manager.  There was no one that could help.  The young woman called the manager but said she cold not reach her and her voicemail was full.  This was a total waste of my time and gas as I could have placed an order online with no problem.  I drove down there becaue I wanted to see some of the products I was interested in.  Also, many of the shelves were half empty and the products looked like they have been there a very long time.  To say the least, I wont go back.

This is a five star for me.  I am an artist that has participated since day one.  I have watched this artist showing grow from the beginning.  It is great for several reasons...the artists are new and innovsative, the bands all along the walk give it a great groove, the people that run it really do care.  I wouldn't miss it either as an artist or attendee.  You will find something special that makes great for you too.
