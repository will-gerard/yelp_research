It's my favorite place to eat in arizona.    The chicken shawarma is the best.  The only thing you need to eat is the chicken shawarma plate.  My husband and I are addicted.   From the second we go in there they are already putting in our order.  That's how much love this place.

Best pizza in arizona hands down!!  The deep dish is amazing.  The Sears tower is the best pizza there.

Service was horrible!!  My wings were burnt and not good.  However, my husband thought his wings were pretty good.  It was hot and stuffy in the restaurant.   Kids meals are a little over priced and dessert is majorly over priced.  I got cheese cake for dessert which was $8.  I was expecting a slice close to the cheesecake factory and I got a tiny piece of old cheesecake. Overall, we will not be back any time soon.

Great food.  We will be back for sure.  Went here tonight with my husband and son.  We all got something different and we all loved what we got.  Son got a breakfast burrito and said it was the best he has had.
