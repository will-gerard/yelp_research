Bianco is simply the Best... Bianco is the standard that all other Phoenix pizza joints try to emulate. The Wiseguy - Local fennel sausage, carmelized onions and smoked mozzarella... Delish!!!! Don't let complaints about the wait steer you from Bianco... Eat as the locals do at their 2nd location at Town & Country located at Camelback Road & 20th Street

Wowza... We had an amazing time and meal last night!   Let me start off by addressing some of the previous reviews... It is a local business, so relax on the "Corporate expectations". This place is obviously very proud of their product, so if you are expecting food variations/manipulation - you should go to Applebee's. Their food & beverage preparation is a craft and should be experienced as presented.   Their jerk chicken was out of this world... An explosion of taste. It is prepared with rice and veggies... I like my food spicy and it didn't disappoint.  This is a must for special occasions. Small, intimate and very clean! Yes, the price points are high. You get what you pay for in ambiance, quality and experience. Too often, Phoenix residents fail to realize that we are one of the cheapest "big" cities in the nation. This place is worth the experience and it separates itself from the norm in Downtown Phoenix.

Where to begin...  Barbra Seville is the Drag Queen of Phoenix... Few Can match her wit and humor. She is quick, sassy and full of hilarious shade! As the intro states "Glitz, Glam and Glamour!!! It's the Babra Fucken Seville Show"  Make sure you take a pill to de-sensitize yourself as you may be chosen as a target. It is a boisterous, fun-filled event. Special events aside, you can expect 2-3 other performers that can run the range of the gamut. Audience participation is strongly encouraged.  The drinks are good and the staff are all very nice to the patrons. Reservations are strongly recommended as most shows end up being standing room only. Plan on arriving at 9:30 to settle in and get your cocktails. DO NOT arrive late. The show starts promptly at 10:00pm. This Is a source of pride for the Barbra and those that enter after the doors close will hear about it!!! Do not, I REPEAT, do not walk onstage or in front of the perfomers. There are many ways to exit, and if choose to disrupt the show - lets just say you had it coming to you...  Bring your energy, bring your DOLLARS and enjoy a 2 hour "Sevillabration"   Research The Rock before attending as the information listed above is incorrect. Make your reservations mid-week or risk standing all night. Cover charge is $3.00 PP. Groups of 6+ must pre-pay with a credit card. I have submitted a request to update business information. Enjoy.

******* 1 star service/ 4 star food ******  What a nightmare!!! What was supposed to be a birthday meal meal for a friend, quickly turned out to be a sideshow...  When we asked the waitress if the special of the night "green chile pasta" had seafood, she adamantly stated no. When asked what type of pasta it was made with she had no clue. She the proceeded to inch her way over to the next table of diners and poke them for the answer. After much debate the patrons determined it was a rice noodle. This was very uncomfortable for all parties.   2 of us received our meals. When Our birthday friend received his pasta special... It was decorated with shrimp. We specifically asked about seafood due to allergies and were told no seafood was included. When we advised our server that we could not accept the meal due to the seafood, she shrugged us off and said she would send over the waitress. Once the waitress arrived we explained the allergy situation again and advised her that this could not be eaten... Instead of apologizing for her error, she asked if we wanted them to "remove" the shrimp??? We stated to her that it would need to be remade. With some resistance she took the plate. 10 minutes later a shrimp free version arrived.  Our birthday guest had to wait 10 more minutes than we did to receive his food. We opted to eat our dishes, otherwise, we would have had cold dishes ourselves....  The total bill for this event was $ 154.00 + tax. I tipped the waitress $40.00 as a courtesy as I was advised she split tips with the busboy and server- who very polite and on point.  I proceeded to email Richardsons to advise of the experience. It has been 2 + weeks and not a word from this restaurant. I was not looking for anything except an apolgy and ownership for ruining a birthday celebration.  This restaurant is far from a 3 star service level... What a shame as the food is exceptional. Recognizing that the entire experience is key when charging $25.00 + price points for meal is a must in this competitive market.  Stick to Barrio Cafe as they have the formula for success down. I will never eat here again and route all co-workers, family and friends elsewhere.

I've lived in Aura for a few years now. It is centrally located and very convenient to many Mid-Town restaurants and activities. The Management company is very responsive to our needs and ensures a good quality of life for residents. We have a vey diverse resident pool and are very pet friendly!!!
