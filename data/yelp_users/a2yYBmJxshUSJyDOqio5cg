Most places I goto that have a smaller menu, I figure that it's due to them keeping it simple and as a result, having really good food. Now I totally missed the disclaimer on them menu saying that they do not season meat, but had I seen that it would of explained alot.   I got a chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and a salad with ranch dressing. The salad came out and the iceberg lettuce looked about 4 days  past due to the point where it had started to change colour. The ranch dressing covering the top tasted good but was a bit much.  The chicken fried steak that came next was huge x2, covered in white (un seasoned) gravy with a side of mashed potatoes covered in the same gravy. I feel that when I go out, I should not have to add extra seasoning to my food and having missed the warning, my first bite was not what I was expecting. The other reviews nailed it by saying it was bland, the flour batter on the steak, the steak itself, the white gravy, all very bland. Had I ordered without gravy, I could put some of the 30 condiments that were on the table, on the steak but, alas I thought the gravy would not work with hot sauce.  I'd probably come back and try it again now knowing that the meat isn't seasoned but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.

In an effort to help Todd F. on his Arizona steak search, we went to check out Houston's. After all I have heard about it and how much I liked it, I'm a bit disappointed I waited so long to check it out.  Both of us ordered the NY Strip steak with mine being medium rare. It was perfectly done and melt in your mouth tender. I'm not a big baked potato fan but that was what came with the steak (fully loaded) and it was nothing short of awesome. If all baked potatoes were like that, I'd be in potato heaven.  I will definitely be back sometime in the very near future!

Coupons FTW Save yourself a couple bucks from the normal price for about 10 seconds worth of google searching for sweet tomatoes coupons.  I like the different themes they have monthly but I do wish they would change them more often like they do in May and June. I also wish they had the french onion soup more.  As far as the salads, Iv'e never had a bad one and hope it continues like that!

The place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control. I cant imagine a more unrelaxing setting. The food, while there was alot of it, was mediocre at best and at 11 dollars a person, not worth it IMO. The best part was that the drink was included in the price. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.

I used to live fairly close to this long wongs and frequently ordered food from there. I would always take the food to go as the inside of the restaurant left alot to be desired. My biggest concern was if the cleanliest of the seating area of the place, extended into the kitchen as well. The food was always good and was always what I expected but I never wanted to stay for long as the inside of the restaurant was always dirty.  I would give the food a 4 and the restaurant a 1 if I could separate the rating system.

The price out on the sign for gas is the cash price. Its 10c a gallon higher if you use debit or credit. There is also a $5 minimum to use debit or credit in the store. I realize it costs money to utilize credit cards but that's the cost of doing business, Because of this extra fee for choosing not to carry cash, I will go out of my way to avoid this store and spend my money where they want my business.

I thought I had something horribly wrong with my cooling system and was in dire straights when I looked up mechanica on Yelp. I found Mike Vinson  auto. After reading the reviews, I was set.  They were able to take a look at the car right away since if the problem was major, I would be stuck for a 40+ mile ride home. While I went and grabbed a bite to eat, they looked at the car and found something so minor that I am embarrassed to admit that it never occurred to me. A new radiator cap, the price of a pressure test and I was on my way.  Quick, efficient and honest. If I have car trouble again, this is where I'm going.

Love this place for lunch. The cheese pizza is a bit greasy but can be dabbed with some napkins. The website has a buy 2 slices get 1 free slice so for 6 bucks, you get a huge amount of pizza which it good for putting me into a pizza coma once I get back to work.

I had to review this taco bell not for the food, but for the dude working the drive through. I'm pretty sure his name is Wayne and he is the friendliest, most upbeat drive through guy I have ever seen in my life. He definitely makes going here easier. I wish everyone loved their job as much as he does!

Talk about a no pressure sales place. They let me explain what I wanted, made some recommendations which were spot on, explained the differences in tires and ended up having me pick something else with no pitch back to a more expensive tire. Very unusual in my experience but wishing I experienced more of it.

Been here many times always for a Dbacks game. I really like the stadium itself, I've never had a bad view of the game even when getting the cheap sets. As usual the food is stupidly expensive but its what people have come to expect as part of the experience. The fans add to the luster or in this case, the lack of luster of the stadium. The Dbacks fans seem sedated, the only ones cheering are the opposition team's fans,which come out in droves and have always outnumbered dbacks fans. It doesn;t have the electricity of a Wrigley field or a Busch stadium, but its still a good place to go to watch a ball game...especially if you cheer for the other team!

Went here for lunch a couple days ago. I got a  cheese steak with onions and wiz. My wife got a chicken parm sandwich. The meat was really tasty and seasoned well. The cheese wiz was awesome! The bun it came on could of been a bit softer and fresher but the bun that it came on was still good, just not as good as it could be.  My wife's sandwich on the other hand....she took 1 bite of mine and wished she had gotten that instead. 3/4 of the chicken parm sandwich got thrown away. The sauce was had WAY too much garlic but why on earth would you order a chicken sandwich at a cheese steak joint. Live and learn! We also got an order of fries that were really good, they did need ketchup and Id have a tough time eating them without but with the ketchup = superb! I'll be back - especially since its across the street from the office!

Gyro Pita + greek salad for $7 at lunch is my usual fare when I go. The greek fries are pretty amazing and the baklava is awesome too.  If you notice, there is a 20% off your next visit at the bottom of your receipt which is one of the many reasons that keeps me coming back.

We lived about a 1/2 mile away from the farm grill and would pass it almost everyday. it always looked like an interesting place  and knew the ingredients were fresh with the huge field right next door. After we saw it on food network, we knew we had to go check it out. We were not disappointed at all.   The first time (of several) that we have been, I got a burger with the bleu cheese on it ( I can't remember the name of it off hand) but it was cooked perfectly and I made the perfect choice of having onion rings instead of fries. OMG they were good. We have tried almost everything on the menu with that original burger and onion rings being my favourite so far.  When people come into town, we usually try to take them to the farm grill and no one has ever had a bad meal or walked away disappointed. if someone asks me where to get some good food, I instantly think of Joe's Farm Grill.  Oh yeah, the drink station and bathrooms are cool!

How weird is that. I think Tonia B. may of been sitting at the table over from us during lunch!  The rolls have improved since my last visit. They were no longer greasy, hopefully last time was a fluke. The pho was awesome. I have never had a bowl of pho with so much meat in it. This time I got the #9 which was $1 more than the rest...maybe that's why.  Anyways, it was a very good lunch!

After a long weekend of work, this was a nice way to finish it all off.  I ordered a 24oz Porterhouse, ceaser salad and we all got the family style au gratin potaoes and mac and cheese. Lets start with the bread that was offered up when we sat down. Excellent! The pretzel bread was very different and unexpected. The ceaser was next which also was excellent, I know its hard to make a bad ceaser, but I've seen it done. Next was the porterhouse, medium rare plus (they have inbetweens of the normal cooked selections). Wow is all I can say. It was the best steak I've had in a while. Cooked perfectly and the filet side was melt in your mouth. The 2 cheesy sides were very good as well, but if I had to complain about something I'd have to say too much cheese. After they had cooled down a bit, the cheese just kind of formed into a great big mass and was pretty unappetizing.  I also need to mention the waiter. He knew the menu like he had written it himself and could tell us the ingredients of every dish we asked about. He was pretty amazing. The 2nd waiter who came by to scrape the crumbs off the table was pretty cool too.

The good:  The food was actually tasty.  The bad:  It was a little on the less than hot side and could stand some time under a broiler.  The ugly:  The 4 people (5 including us) wandering the restaurant with bill and credit card in hand looking for someone to pay. We waited 20 mins before getting up to look for someone who wanted to take our money. Oh yeah, they forgot to bring our appitizer and seemed to not believe us but eventually took it off the bill.

Lunch on Saturday consisted of Dac Biet Pho and some spring rolls. The Pho was good with alot of tendon, hardly any tripe with really melt in your mouth beef slices. The broth was not all that salty which was a really good thing. The wife got a childs size bowl which is another good thing since she can't eat a full size bowl. The spring rolls were almost all meat with very little filler, also really good.   The staff was awesome, all were super friendly and the waitress was right on us when out pop ran low. I really liked the restaurant itself since it didn't feel so hole in the wall and had a very very nice saltwater aquarium as you walked in the door. Overall, its worth going back for next time I'm in the area.

Went back again since the last time I was there the steak was so good. We were seated as we walked in the door, asked if we had been there before and since this was the newest of several visits, I thought I knew what I was expecting that is until we ordered drinks.   We both ordered a beer and were promptly asked for our ID. Now I have no hair on my head (not by choice) and look a ton older than 21 (I'm 34). I didn't have my id with me. The waitress said let me go check with my manager. After a minute or so the manager comes over and informs us she cannot serve me alcohol because I have no id. I told her about the money she would be losing tonite since I am obviously older than 21 at which point she said "this is the sound of my heart breaking" in the most you've mistaken me for someone who cares attitude.  What the sound actually was, was the sound of money leaving her restaurant and never returning. Had she simply explained why they couldn't, no problem. No need to be condescending about it. Due to her attitude, we left and found someplace else to eat and will never be back to the Texas roadhouse.

Pros: Ordered delivery, got here fast  Cons: Wings were clearly freezer burnt. Garlic "Flavoured" crust had no flavour all the toppings (with the exception of pepperoni and cheese) were in a 2 inch circle in the middle of the 2 pies we got Crust was very hard for being a pan crust After all was said and done (2 pies and an order of wings), it was kinda expensive for the quality.  This place has taken the top spot on my pizza to avoid list, dethroning domino's.

Went here after supper at the Italian place in fashion square wasn't as fulfilling as we had hoped.  First time eating toro and damn, it was worth every penny! We ended up getting a couple orders along with some spicy tuna roll (which was great) and some other sashimi which I failed to find out what it was but still tasty nonetheless. Along with a couple of the large Kirin beers, it was a treat to eat here. Loved it.

I am not a shopper. When I enter a store, I know what I want and usually the time spent in the store is spent on looking for that item and not browsing so much. That's how things started out in Smeeks but quickly turning into a shopping and browsing experience.  It had been years since I was in a candy store and to sit back and look at all the stuff that I want but cannot eat is agonizing. They have a ton of candy that is original from hard candy to chocolates to toffees to chocolate bars which leads me to why I was there. COFFEE CRISPS. I spotted them almost as soon as I walked in the store and as I stood and looked at the other candy surrounding them, it took me back to Canada. Crispy Crunch, Eat More, Caramilk, Smarties (not the tart candies - the candy covered chocolate) all of the things I haven't seen in years and I wanted to buy and eat to send me into diabetic coma but I held back and bought only what I came for...Coffee Crisps...and they were damn good! Smeeks, I'll be back to buy more someday, See you then!

Not realizing it was father's day, we tried to goto the breakfast club in which were were in store for a 50 minute wait. On his way over to meet us, Todd F. wandered by Petite Maison and went in to see if they were open. Luck would have it they were and we gave up on the breakfast club and came over here and were we happy we did. I had been wanting to come here for a while now and have just been too busy to have a chance to visit so I was pretty happy today.  They have a 3 course selection for breakfast. My first course was the saumon fume which was smoked salmon with creme freche and chives along with chopped eggs. The perfect start to breakfast! The 2nd course I went for the crab crepes which again were awesome. My wife chose the house eggs which are very similar to eggs benedict and after a bite of that, I wish I had chose differently. And finally for desert, we all got the beignets au nuttella which is a pastry that comes with a small bowl of melted nutella. I would of taken the nutella with a spoon and been happy but the pastry was very good as well. All this AND nonstop mimosas, champagne or bellinis. After this breakfast, we are looking forward to going back for the staff meal next friday night.

I moved out to San Tan Valley about 5 months ago. Our favourite take out chinese place was Red Dragon in Chandler and since it was too far away, we started looking around for something closer. Luckily we found the China Chef. We have ordered several things for take away as well as ate in and I have not had a single problem with any of the food there. My wife usually orders the General Tso chicken and I mix it up with a different dish everytime. I really like the war wan ton soup as well as the bourbon chicken. The rice is awesome and the noodles are great. The food is so good there, while I wrote this review I convinced myself to order something from them! Oh, and the prices are really good too.

I always shopped at another grocery store...until we moved to San tan valley that is. I had always thought that the stuff at frys foods were overpriced compared to their competitors, it turns out that is only partly true. Once I started reading the flyers and looking for deals, if you buy the stuff on sale, it will almost always be cheaper at frys. The problem is if the stuff you want isn't on sale. it can tend to be a little pricier but for the sake of convenience, its a price I am willing to pay.  Onto this store in particular. Its always clean, always well stocked, the clerks are always friendly and I have never had one problem there. I like the quality of the meats they have and when I do have a question, regardless of what butcher I talk to, they can point me in the right direction. The other nice thing about this store is they have a gas station in the parking lot. using your frys points, you can get 10c off per gallon once you have spent a combined 100 dollars. Its nice to have the convenience of the gas station being right there. If I were to have a gripe about anything with the store, I would have to say it is with how busy it gets at certain times of the day. its to be expected when you are the only grocery store in the area but they should expect the rush and open more lanes of cashiers to handle it. I try to avoid going at those times (5pm after work, Saturday mornings) and since I do, its a nice experience as far as grocery shopping goes.

Bought a new car on 4/30/11 from Chapman VW. We had been looking for a while and had visited some dealers out in the east valley but decided to look at the dealers a little closer to work.   The whole process was pretty easy compared to the other dealers I've bought cars from. We walked in and asked to test drive a jetta tdi. We went out with the salesman and he answered the questions while we drove (without any sales tactics). When we got back to the dealership, we weren't ready to buy and when we told them that they gave us a number on what they could sell the car. We thanked them and left.  We went and test drive a few others and ended up back at the VW lot. The price they had quoted us for was not for the car we test drove but for a lower model. Its an obvious tactic to get us to come back to the dealership but I would sooner be upfront about the cost and not have the "ohhh you wanted a price on THAT car, not this one over here that you've never seen). This is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. The salesman was great, the finance guy was great, the dude we dealt with on price negotiation was better than most but not as good as the other 2 guys.  I'll be updating this one with the service intervals so lets see if the service department can keep up their end of the bargain.

Barry comes out once a month to do our yard cleanup. Mow the lawn, trim the bushes, pull/spray the weeds, the usual. About a week before his first visit, we lost a tree to a storm in the front yard. We had already scheduled him to come out for the first visit while we were going to out of town and we totally forgot to mention the tree to him. When we got back home, to our surprise he had cut up and taken the fallen tree with them while they were at the house. When my wife talked yo him he said yeah we figured we would just grab it while we were already there. AWESOME! Saved me an extra call and a few bucks at the same time and that works for me.
