I stayed here for the Rock n Roll LV 1/2 of the Half race this past weekend.   I'm an SPG Platinum, and frequently seek out SPG properties.  The hotel staff were super friendly. Every encounter I had was positive.  It's NOT your standard Vegas hotel. It's more like a business hotel with a casino in the lobby. Some will see this as a plus, some as a drawback. It didn't bother me, and in some ways, it was nice to have a quieter hotel.  Rooms were comfortable, and standard Westin decor. Heavenly bed, double shower heads, etc. No Vegas glitz in the rooms here.  You don't have to walk through a long maze to get to registration or in/out of the hotel--this was nice!  This property is one block off the strip, which is about a 5 minute walk to LV Blvd. It also has easy access to the monorail at the Flamingo Hilton, which made it very easy to get around.  This is definitely an airline crew hotel--you will see them coming and going all the time. It didn't impact my stay.  I didn't use any of the hotel amenities (spa, pool, etc., so can't comment there).   I got to meet the RunWestin crew as they were in town for the RnR race--it was a plus, but they won't be there every weekend.  Bottom line: I liked this property. Depending on what you're looking for in a Vegas hotel, it may not may not work for you.

I returned to the Westin Las Vegas for the 2014 Rock n Roll Half Marathon and had another positive experience. My SPG Platinum status was once again recognized and it felt like the team went above and beyond (extra water, premium floor, etc.).   As I mentioned in my previous review, this isn't like the big iconic Vegas hotels, but the location, ease of getting in and out, and friendly service make it work for me.   This time I did use the hot tub... Really appreciate that it's available 24/7. The Rock n Roll LV races are at night, and we didn't get back to the property until midnight. Even though it was late, towels were still stocked (and we were reassured when we called to inquire that if towels were not there, we could call and they would bring them).   The hotel is updated to current Westin standards, including the new shower heads.   This is one of the race hotels, which is nice.   Rock n Roll things to note: - You will have to go a couple of miles to the start line... The monorail was super backed up this year (leave EARLY... much earlier than you think) and will still end up walking a lot before you even start.  - The half and full marathons end in front of the Mirage. LV Blvd is closed until close to midnight, so if you stay here, you will either encounter a very spendy cab ride (that goes around the closures) or will need to walk about half a mile back to the property from the end of the finishers chute (it looked further... Will know for next year!)

My friend K and I flew into Vegas for the Rock n Roll Las Vegas events. Seeking a healthy and yummy lunch, K suggested Paymon's. She'd discovered this place when she had a project in LV and I was happy to go along as I love Mediterranean cuisine.  A little ways off the strip, this gem can be found in an unassuming strip mall. The restaurant itself is quite large and it looks like from the doors that they have expanded into adjacent storefronts a few times. I can see why :)  When we arrived for a late lunch, we were quickly seated by a friendly hostess. Our waiter was great--checked in with us regularly and helped us figure out how much to order without over ordering.   We decided to split a plate because he advised us it was large--it was! The chicken kabob skewer has 10 ounces of meat on it! We also split a side of dips--the babaghanouj and the yogurt dip. The baba was probably the best I've ever had! It comes with a side of white or whole wheat pita. When we ran out, we were offered more pita or sliced veggies (super healthy--love it!)  The chicken kabob plate was perfect for two fit friends to split. With 10 ounces of grilled chicken, we each got ample protein. It also came with a greek salad, roasted red peppers and a great rice dish. We finished most, but not all of the plate--that's how large it was.  Since we were visiting and didn't have a car, we asked our waiter to call a cab and he quickly obliged. When one didn't show up, he checked in, found out the cab company was in the middle of a shift change, and took the initiative to call a second cab company so that we wouldn't have a much more prolonged wait.   If I lived locally, this would definitely be a place I'd come regularly. Tasty food, good portions and great service--winner in my book!

Vegas, without being too Vegas!  I spent the weekend at Red Rock for a friend's wedding. What a gem! First of all, they offer complimentary shuttle service to/from the airport, saving you a $50 cab ride. Every part of my experience here was fabulous. This is, simply, the friendliest hotel I've ever stayed at. Every time I encountered a "team member" I was greeted with a genuine "hello." The hotel has great decor--modern, a little trendy, but not too over the top. And the beds are soooo comfortable! Great pool. I also liked that the casino was accessible, but you weren't forced to walk through it for everything. My only nit with them is that they seemed a bit overwhelmed for the Memorial Day holiday weekend... nothing too bad, but just a tad underprepared. I'd definitely go back and recommend to others.

I returned for my second year to RNR AZ. This year, I opted to do the remix challenge with the 5K on Saturday and the half on Sunday.   The expo was large again, and in the Phoenix convention center, right off the light rail. I opted to stay in Tempe because the 5K and Half Marathon start and finish lines were all there and my only trip to Phoenix would be for the expo.  The 5K starts adjacent to Tempe Beach park and ends in Tempe Beach park. We walked there, but there was ample parking for those who drove. The course is quick and scenic and has the same finish as the half marathon, giving us a preview of the next day. Even with the short distance, participants get a tech tee, medal, one water stop and one band on course and refreshments and a finish concert.   The half course was fairly similar to last year (a few tweaks due to construction, I think?) The half and 10K start together on the ASU campus (while the full marathon starts in Phoenix). Plenty of parking for those who drive, but beware of road closures. We caught an uber over and it was difficult to get there.  PF Changs is no longer a sponsor as of 2016, so no horses at the start, or dragon running on the course :(  The course wanders through Tempe into Scottsdale, and ending at Tempe Beach park. I had a bit of a rough race (recovering from an injury), but still had a positive experience. Bands on a pretty regular basis, well staffed hydration stops.   The one frustrating thing is that on some sections of the course, we had the inner lanes of the road with traffic on the outermost lane on both sides. I understand this averts full road closures, but the problem is if you need to pull over and stretch, you need to watch for traffic.  Huge finish area at Tempe Beach Park. The medals from 2015-2018 will connect to make a super medal, so I guess I'm in for the whole shebang now!

My friend K suggested SUSHISAMBA for dinner... I was trying to look at the menu online and what I could find did not represent the full menu. If you are using an iOS device (iPad/iPhone), you can't see the menu. I was almost dissuaded, but was so glad she talked me into coming here for a drink and checking out the menu!  So, needless to say, great menu, so we put our name in and settled into the bar. The hostesses take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, which is a great option so you're not tied to staying right by the entry waiting for a table.  The bartender was super sweet and made us great cocktails. I enjoyed the Lychee Bubbletail, which was delectable. K had a drink with berries and elderflower liqueur, which was also fab.  K had insisted that the sea bass skewers were amaze balls, so we went with that. We started with two orders (2 skewers each) and sides of the coconut rice and black beans. The beans were tasty, but hard to eat with chopsticks. Coconut rice was fantastic and I could have eaten a whole bowl by myself (but I'm glad I didn't).  Karen's suggestion on the skewers totally delivered. We even ended up getting a third order because they were sooooo good! Melty and flavorful. We even convinced the guys next to us to get an order and they liked it, too!  We finished with a desert that was a chocolate upside-down cake with bananas. It was small, but perfect. Super flavorful, great texture and perfect to share with a friend.  Service was good, but not a standout.   I could basically eat those sea bass skewers every day.   It's a little spendy, but let's face it, everything on the strip is. I'd definitely come back.

Disappointing experience as a Lifetime Platinum.   I came into town for the Rock n Roll Arizona Half. By the time I decided to come, most of the race hotels were sold out, so when I saw this one was in relative close proximity to the start and finish lines, AND had an airport shuttle, it sounded like a great fit.   I know the Four Points is a lower level brand within SPG, but I have had some really terrific experiences at other 4P properties... Just not this one.   The airport shuttle was great and both of my drivers were very professional and friendly.   The lobby looks current. The rest of the property, not so much. Dingy, dark, dated hallways. According to the property guide, there are ice machines on the 2nd Nd 4th floors, but the 4th floor one is missing (really... ONE ice machine for an entire hotel?!?!)  The front desk staff are very nice, but seemed a little overwhelmed when there was a line.   A number of us had inquired about the complementary breakfast, but were told it would not be available until 7 AM, even though a significant number of the guests were doing the race and needed to eat earlier. I was told the GM had told his front desk staff to tell us there were no exceptions. When I asked to speak with him, he was "not available."  My room, on the SPG (4th) floor, was clean, but so noisy. Day noise from a generator, and night noise from loud people on the street... Maybe because of the proximity to ASU?   I found my experience to be disappointing, and since the GM wouldn't even speak with a lifetime platinum, I can only assume guest satisfaction is not really a priority here. If I return for another race, it won't be to this property.

I stayed here while in town for the Rock n Roll Arizona race weekend. While Aloft is not a full service property, I found this hotel was well staffed and the team members were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and well maintained. I wish the bedding had a heavier cover (I like the weight). Grab and go area by the lobby is well stocked and has a wide variety of items at a reasonable price.   Location is convenient to a strip mall with several dining options (if you want something quick) and a Starbucks. It's a short (15 minute or so) walk to ASU and the light rail.  The rooms are all the same, so no upgrade to be had, but we were placed on the highest floor.  Price and location were right for what I needed. I would definitely consider staying here again!

Beautiful modern hotel in the City Center complex, non smoking, no casino.  For a non-smoker like me, a smoke free property in Vegas was a great win! Gaming isn't available in this hotel, but is in all of the adjacent properties (Bellagio-attached, Cosmopolitan--next door, Aria--short walk around the roundabout).   Rooms are large and modern, and come with a full kitchen, washer and dryer. It turns out this was originally a condominium building, and those amenities are a nice touch.  A nice spa is located within the property. The market cafe downstairs is a nice place for breakfast, a light bite, or to pick up items to keep in your kitchen.  One thing to note: there are no rooms with two doubles, though rooms come with a pullout sofa. The pullout sofa is pathetic!!!!!!!!! We pulled out the sofa and found the skinniest, creakiest (looked unused) mattress we'd ever seen... with four of us in the room, the two of us tried out the bed and rolled into one another--EEK! The hotel accommodated us and brought up a rollaway, and we made up the couch as a bed (instead of the pullout configuration). Just know this isn't the idea way to sleep four, so plan ahead or book elsewhere.  Resort fee is $25/night (grrr... pet peeve of mine), but includes free internet (pretty quick, but you need to launch your web browser to activate it before opening apps on a smartphone or tablet), free newspapers and a few other things. Parking is not included, but we flew in, so not an issue for us.  Service all around was friendly and efficient. Nice central location on the strip and we were able to walk everywhere we needed to go (however a cab might be helpful for the more northern- or southern-end properties).

2013: Zappos 1/2 of the Half (inaugural race)  My third Rock n Roll event ever.  My friend and I opted for the new Zappos 1/2 of the Half, and this is the first year it was offered. I think the shorter distance encouraged some new folks to try a race. My friend had never done a race and she was willing to try, and we even met a few folks who were parents accompanying their adult children who were doing the half or the full, and they did this shorter race. Definitely a nice option. That said, for the first time, there were some kinks that need to be worked out:  1) The mile markers were confusing... the courses partially paralleled the half and full courses, so there were two sets of mile markers and if i you didn't know what you were looking for, it was confusing. My friend got frustrated by thinking she was further along than she was. 2) No tech tee. The half and full racers got a nice black tech t, but we got a regular tee. It's cute, but I kinda felt like a second class citizen with a different shirt. 3) Staff was uninformed at the finish line. There were shuttles available, but some people didn't know about them, and others gave us the wrong location (about 2 blocks from where we should have been) 4) Some miscommunication between event organizers and shuttle company. The race started at 3:35 and was 6.5 miles. Even a speedy runner at a 5 or 6 minute mile wouldn't finish finish before 4:10 PM. Plus, there was the finisher area with refreshments and medals. After finally finding the shuttle pickup (not marked) on a very dark residential street, we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally a bus came, but couldn't get all the people waiting. There was a near riot. Finally some event organizer staff came by and said another bus was on the way. Another came and we boarded. The bus driver told us we were "late" and "should have been done by 4." He got yelled at. I don't know where the miscommunication occurred (between RNR and his company? between his company and him? who knows), but chiding a bunch of people who have just completed a race and were standing out in the cold is not a good way to go. 5) There also seemed to be confusion over same-day packet pickup. We met some guys at our hotel who didn't know where to go and didn't have a way to contact anyone :(  On the upside: 1) GREAT expo. Since this is a large race, vendors were out in full force. Lots of fun photo ops. 2) Huge start line festival, complete with a band! Water, plentiful portapotties, and snacks all available. 3) Good course support: friendly volunteers with beverages, drinks and cheerful disposition 4) People on the sidelines. It's Vegas, so it was missing some of the local flair of the other races, but people were going crazy on the sidelines throughout the strip. One of the wedding chapels in downtown Vegas even had their Elvis out front serenading us! LOVED it! 5) Shows off Vegas landmarks... strip hotels, wedding chapels, Fremont Street. 6) Thank you to Zappos for sponsoring a coffee/hot chocolate truck for us. I was sad we didn't get chocolate milk at the finish and this was a nice treat. 7) The awesome Rock n Roll participants... seriously, everyone is so friendly! You can talk to complete strangers and everyone is in a great mood. They are there to have fun and it's a great community.  Tip for racing newbies: since it's the desert and temps can vary greatly, my friend and I wore arm warmer sleeves... very handy as we heated up and could slide them down, and then slide them back up as the desert temps dropped quickly. Plan your layers accordingly.  I'll definitely come back, but would do the half... this event was a little disorganized and I felt like a second class citizen in the shorter event.

I returned in 2014 for the brand new Remix Challenge, which consisted of the inaugural SLS 5K on Saturday, and your choice of race on Sunday (1/2of the Half, Half or Full Marathon).    This year, every race distance sold out in advance. The weekend definitely had a busier feel than last year (and last year was busy!!).  EXPO:  I flew in on Saturday morning. My friends and I got to the expo around 1 and to say it was a scene is no exaggeration. I got there about the same time last year and it wasn't this insane. It was so packed, we actually ended up skipping most of the vendors because it was almost impossible to move.   Some tips to help you navigate: 1) Print out your confirmation sheet(s) in advance 2) Come earlier. I can't say how early, but before Saturday afternoon.  3) Take the monorail to the expo center  I didn't sign up for VIP so I had to stand in two lines for each of my bibs (5K and Half) and then again for shirts.   5K This was the first year for this option, and for the Remix Challenge. It sold out and proved popular. The course starts and ends in the parking lot of the new SLS, and travels around the area.   We arrived to find a festival-like atmosphere with a DJ, lighted displays, etc. It was a parking lot, but they made the best of it!   There were only supposed to be four corrals, but it seemed like they did 7 or 8 launches of people.   Not gonna lie... This isn't a great course. You basically get one lane of closed traffic on the street along a loop around the perimeter of the SLS. No music along the way. It's the northernmost end of the strip, so not a lot of spectators either.   At the halfway point was a junior cheer squad cheering and handing out water. They were the cutest!   Finally we came back to the end, went through a light display and crossed the finish. They had plenty of refreshments, photographers, medals and the Michelob tent (one free beer for participants).   Took the monorail to and from and it was packed. I think they need to run extra trains during these high traffic events.   HALF (Sunday) This year, the temps dropped significantly between Saturday and Sunday. If you do this race, make contingency plans in your dress for the weather to change. It was colder than forecast and this was tough. Desert temps can be brutal (both hot and cold).   We left the Westin at 3 to head to the monorail. Unfortunately, they were slowing people into the monorail and it took us about an hour to get on. We were not warned. By the time we got off at MGM, and walked to the start line carnival, they were singing the National anthem, the concert was over and the pre-race snacks were shut down. Leave much earlier than you think you will need to.   The half and the full have a shared start, and there were close to 60 corrals. We ended up getting into 37 ( the best we could get to when we got there) and it took a full hour for us to reach the start line. Yes, the race started at 4:30, and we crossed at 5:30.   Plenty of entertainment and spectators along the way. There is a desolate stretch around mile 7(?) just before Fremont St where you are routed through a dark quiet set of streets. No spectators, no music, no nothing. But then you get to Fremont and know you're in the home stretch.   Around mile 11 or 12, there was a great long stretch of speakers pumping 80s music. It was a great pump-me-up.   As you approach the finish line, the crowds are thick and full of excitement.   The finish corral is well organized, especially for being such a massive race. There are tons of volunteers helping with everything. BUT, the finish corral is about a mile long. Yes, really! There are medals, beers, chocolate milk, power bars, bananas and for once, plenty of space blankets!!!!   OVERALL COMMENTS The Competitor Group (owners of the RNR series) are very well organized. Even though this race was huge, they were ready.   They also listen to feedback. This year, all race distances got technical t's (with great designs). Very appreciated!  Great race bling for all distances, and totally tailored to each location. In fact, the half and full medals have glow in the dark components since its a night race :)  Rock n Roll have all Remix Challenge participants a black wristband. At the end of the finisher corral, we simply had to walk up to the Heavy Medal tent, show our wristband, have it snipped, and were handed our medal. Compared to the wait I had for my Cali Combo medal at RNRLA (a much smaller race), this was a cake walk.   This was by far the largest race I've ever done (and I've done runDisney events, which are also quite big). While well organized, be prepared that if you're not an elite level runner, you may have to do a lot of standing and waiting.   And it's Vegas, so you will be walking/on your feet a lot even without the race--be prepared! My fitbit registered 53,500 steps at the end of the day, which is roughly the equivalent of 26 miles. I had about 10,000 (5 miles) before we left for the start.

I was here in June for some meetings in downtown Vegas, and our host suggested this hotel. I'd never stayed near Fremont before, and I'd heard the old section was a bit run down. Imagine my happy surprise about the ECC Suites!  You check in across the street at the El Cortez, which is dark, smoky and dated. But head across the street to the Cabana Suites and it's a completely different vibe! Lobby is light, spacious and well-designed, and has a giant container of M&Ms. Employees are very friendly and helpful.  The room was small but stylish. The bathroom was also well done and the shower had good water pressure. I was in the smallest of the suites, so I couldn't sit at the desk--not ideal--but I also understand most people aren't working in LV.  It's not as posh as some other hotels I've been to, but a great value and very clean. I'd definitely stay here again for an off-strip experience.

Wow, really surprised by the Yelp reviews here! After coming into town with my college pals for a birthday celebration, we decided to head here for dinner as two of my pals knew this place from NYC. It also fit the bill as two of them wanted steak, and two of us wanted sushi.  Before you go any further, this is not your corner sushi restaurant. It's spendy, and it's great. Know that going in, and you won't be surprised. There are less expensive sushi restaurants--this is NOT one of them.  Our server was Jason and he was fantastic. He checked in with us regularly, gave us his opinion when asked, but also offered up customer feedback (i.e. he might not be crazy about a dish personally, but shared with other customers thought). He also sent over the waiter who is a wine aficionado when we had a question about wines, making sure we had the best information. We were even allowed to sample the wines before making a final selection.  T and I were in the sushi set, and we were thrilled with our meal. The fish is exceptionally fresh, and among the best I've ever had. Everything we had was good. The dishes we tried were:  1) Ebi Shumai (shared by all)... don't forget to dip in the ponzu, with a dash of hot mustard on the side 2) Edamame (shared by all): standard sushi bar fare, topped with chunky kosher salt  Sushi menu: 1) KANI SUNOMONO (blue crab sunomono)--blue crap wrapped in cucumber with a vinegar sauce. Blue crab was amazing, but the flavor of the vinegar was lighter than I expected (compared to other sunomono). 2) SPICY TUNA & TEMPURA FLAKES-- The tempura flakes mixed into the spicy tuna was an unexpected and welcome twist on a sushi bar favorite. Tobiko is also mixed in. 3) UNA KYU (eel wrapped in cucumber)--never seen this presentation before, but it was a great contrast between the heated, tender, sweet eel, and the cool cucumber 4) Custom--the sushi chef prepared a spicy salmon roll in the same manner as the spicy tuna & tempura flake roll. This was the winner of the evening. 5) We also had a cooked fish dish, but I couldn't find it on the online menu to tell you more (sorry!) Yellowtail, I think?  Our friends shared the 20 oz bone in rib eye, which was HUGE. T and I aren't red-meat eaters, so I can't give a personal commentary. But they ate every bite, and it was a good sharable dish for two women.  The steak came with tempura onion rings, which were completely ridiculously awesome. That was shared by all. It was a generous side that wasn't finished by our table of four. It also came with a side of bok choi, which was good (not as ridiculous).  They brought our birthday girl an amazing brownie topped with ice cream. The brownie had chocolate chips in it, and was fantastic.  We ordered the mochi and shared that among the four of us. They even cut each piece of the four flavors into four so we could all try all flavors.  Add in two bottles of wine and our total came to $330 (before tip). As I said, this place isn't inexpensive, and it's not your everyday restaurant. But for a great special occasion, this restaurant hit the mark on all levels, from service, to quality of food, to taste. I would definitely come again.

Fabulous time at CPH tonight.   I was in PHX for a quick pre-holiday getaway. We found CPH via Yelp and the restaurant exceeded expectations.  Our server was Gary, who was one of the best servers I've ever had. Attentive, with impeccable timing. He helped pace our courses and wanted to make sure he didn't encourage us to over order.   Onto the food. I started with the signature drink, the Citi Zen.  It's like a grown up lemonade. I didn't even add in the optional rock sugar stick.   Our starter was the fondue. Not too thick, served with crusty bread, apples and sausages.   Next up, the Original Chopped Salad. WOW! That was my favorite. It's a really unexpected combo of tastes, textures and flavors, but it just works. Don't miss this.   Then, the chicken and waffles. Chicken was fried to perfection without being the least bit oily.   Finally, finished with the coffee and donuts, which is a great twist on the flavors, turned into a bread pudding.   If I lived in the PHX area, this would be in my regular rotation.

Another solid experience at Citizen Public House. How has it been four years since my last visit?  Of course, the signature Original Chopped Salad was a must and did not disappoint. It was even better than I remembered.  We then moved on to the fondue, which was also great. Who doesn't love cheese and bread?!?! And this was great cheese and great bread!  We had the scallops next, which, while small, were perfectly prepared and delicious.   The only disappointment was the deconstructed chicken pot pie. The chicken was amazing, but the rest of the dish was just OK. It wasn't bad, but I'd likely try something else next time.  We finished with the Heart of Caramel, which was a chocolate mousse cake, bourbon vanilla ice cream, a chocolate cookie and bourbon caramel sauce. Heaven.  Our server was great and helped us navigate the menu as we were putting together what we wanted to share. I had originally picked a cocktail, but expressed an interest in one of their barrel aged cocktails and he gave me a sip to try. Fantastic service all around and I was happy to come back and visit again!

I was staying at the El Cortez Cabana Suites over the weekend and popped in here Saturday night for a nightcap. The reviews are great, but sadly, this wasn't my experience.  We arrived at midnight and were able to settle into some comfy chairs. What I really like about this bar is that it's mellow and you can actually have a conversation here.   Prices were average--not expensive, but not inexpensive. It was $23.50 for three cocktails. We missed the happy hour.  We had an awful cocktail waitress. It was clear she didn't know much about mixed drinks. I ordered a stoli, soda and lime, and she brought me a pepsi drink. She was fine with the named cocktails from their menu, but not a custom (though not atypical) order. She did have the bartender remake the drink, however. She also interrupted us to settle our tab, even though the bar wasn't closed. It was just an awkward experience all around.

Omg, so delish! A friend was raving about eat, and I saw it as we passed through downtown Las Vegas during the RNR Half Marathon. We returned the next day. Of course, I still had the rungries. My biggest challenge? Picking what to order!  I settled on breakfast (because breakfast is the best!) and ultimately decided on the Truffled Egg Sandwich. First of all, it was ginormous, and came served with a GENEROUS portion of potatoes. They were more than happy to sub turkey bacon for regular bacon (thank you!) and it was great... not the kind of turkey bacon that leaves you feeling deprived. I did polish off the sandwich, but couldn't finish the potatoes, even with help.  For some of my friends who got toast with their dishes, wow, I have never seen toast so thick! It looked like thick cut French toast, but was just regular old toast. The ginger ale was also fantastic and I heard the coffee was, too.  Our server was delightful and knowledgeable about the menu.   My only wish is that I had time and room to eat through more of the menu, but I guess that means I will have to make a return visit. :)  Thank you for a fantastic meal!

I'd heard good things about Culinary Dropout over the years, so I was excited to finally try it on my recent trip to Tempe. The Tempe location is quite large and we almost went in a wrong entrance (it looked like perhaps this was the entrance for private events?).   We had a reservation and were seated immediately, even though the restaurant was hopping on a Friday night.   I had one of the "copperless" moscow mules. It's disappointing not to have the mug, but the drink was mixed to perfection and garnished with a piece of candied ginger (yum!).  We started with the roasted brussel sprouts. They were delicious, but they are served cold (which was fine, but they should call that out because we were confused!). We also had the truffled potato chips, which were great. Both of these are fairly small portions, but enough for some light bites before the entree.  We then split the fried chicken and the turkey pastrami. Our server even arranged to have the dishes split for us (wow!) so we didn't have to manage that.   The fried chicken was alright, but I didn't bother to finish my half. The sides were great though. Honestly, I found the turkey pastrami on the pretzel roll to be the better entree.  We finished with the salted caramel custard, which was topped with caramel corn. Loved that!  Our server was awesome--friendly, gave his honest opinion on the dishes and helped us pick some great items. I'd definitely visit again!

Wow, this new location is a huge improvement over the old. I came back here for the cilantro jalapeno hummus, which was memorable from my visit last year. The new location has a much less eclectic, more classy look.  Surprisingly, on a Saturday night, we were seated quickly. The restaurant was busy, but not packed and the ambiance wasn't too loud. We had an awesome server who did a great job of checking in and staying on top of things (I wish I remembered his name!).  The menu is more simple and easier to navigate than I remember. We started with the aforementioned cilantro jalapeno hummus. My friend got the salmon burger, which he really enjoyed and I got the red quinoa with cilantro jalapeno hummus, which was basically quinoa with greens on the awesome hummus. I also got a side chicken breast.  Iced teas were continuously refilled (in these huge tumblers). We finished off with the rice pudding, which was also great.  Fabulous experience all around! I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area again.
