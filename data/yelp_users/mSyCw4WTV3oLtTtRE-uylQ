My new kitten got sick the first week I got her. In a panic I took her to VCA. They were so good with her. I felt very comfortable with them taking care of what ever the problem was. As well they could not be nicer to me. I received follow up calls which was great. I recommend these guys for sure.

Great American Mexican food. They use fresh Ingredients and interesting ways of presenting the food. Also the black bean side dish was really good.

I think REI has great outdoor products. But the last time I was there, I was some bombarded with sales people I did not even feel like I was in a outdoor outlet. Maybe it was because of the holidays, but they should restructure some of there front training to match what they are selling.

I must say, I just got a new job and was looking to treat myself to a nice lunch and was not to impressed with the food. Especially at that price point. Yes the atmosphere was good and so on. But I would advise to stick to the drinks unless you are into hyped up scenes with no delivery.

So I bought a new bike from DNA one week ago which I payed $650 for. I got two flats the same day not riding the bike hard at all. I bring the bike back and say hey can you help me out. Well I end up getting charged a extra $50 dollars for tubes. I understand they are in the business of making money but c'mon don't think you could take care of me on this first problem! Not only will I not be going back, but I will make sure to tell anyone I ride with what had happened and to not use those guys. Great relationship building DNA and now you have one more person out there to say you suck, cheers.

After going to Side Bar we ate The Living Room. The food really good along with a cool urban downtown atmosphere.
