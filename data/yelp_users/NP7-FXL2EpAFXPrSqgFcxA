Buyer Beware!  Their return policy is a joke.   Dishonest staff lying that you can return an item, whereas they will do thier best you can't. Example, marking merchandise defective on the receipt so its non-returnable.  STAY AWAY! Go down one floor and buy at the big store, where they will work with their customers.

By far the best Chinese food in the valley. Located in central PHX, on NW corner of Camelback and Central. Family owned for 20+ years. Open forlunch and then dinner. Closed 2-5.  Can't go wrong here. Most of customers have been coming here 5+ years. Start with Cabbage Wraps with Jenny's special sauce and crab puffs. Next order anything over low mein, she will do it for you. Ask for desired hottnes :)  Enjoy!

Save your money for something else ... This SHORE is too small, the drinks overpriced, they will try to force a $250 bottle of vodka onto your table even if you say no to it ... scam!!!  music is ok

Phone order guy cant hear you, its your fault he cant hear you. He doesn't know his menu either. He will sigh: oh my god as you repeat the menu item name, but he wants to call it something else. This seems to be in line with the few most recent reviews. PASS!

And btw the same kid that was mentioned in the other negative reviews messed up my order.  Sadly the owner lost many customers over someone who just dngaf.   I recommend you go somewhere else until they take care of the problem.

They have a buffet at lunch time for those who are eating Indian food for the first time. They have about 6 dishes to try from.  For dinner I had butter chicken and Jafrezi (cheese) and both were a hit.  Will be back
