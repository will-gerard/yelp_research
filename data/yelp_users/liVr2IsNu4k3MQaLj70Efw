Best carne asada burrito in town. Plus the red hot sauce/salsa is amazing and addicting. If you eat here, be sure to order the fresh guacamole. When you are finished eating you can grab a drink from the bar and hang out by the pool or chill out on the roof deck above the hotel.

The food looks good and the atmosphere is nice. I like their spin on traditional dishes. The cafe vita coffee was smooth and tasty. Unfortunately my food never showed up so after a 40 minute wait I just asked to cancel the order. Apparently the kitchen didn't notice the order so I figured instead of waiting another 20 minutes, I would simply go somewhere else.
