We showed up and asked how long it would take to serve us our food and were told 10 minutes. 40 minutes later we reminded the lady at the register that people that were in line behind us that ordered the same dish we did(they only had 3 choices) were getting there food and we had ordered before them. She said that she was sorry and that we were next. Three more people got their dishes(same one we ordered) and we went back and let the lady know we hadn't gotten our food. She again said we were up next. When two more people got their dish we knew they had lost our ticket. We asked for a refund and left. Terrible customer service

Lawless creates not only phenomenal custom denim--they also create jobs here in the U.S. All raw materials are produced and purchased on American soil. The entire team greets you and is enthusiastic about what they do. It is evident they are happy to be there. Picking your own fabric, cut, and stitching is so exciting. I am thrilled to have something like this come to the valley! I had a wonderful experience.
