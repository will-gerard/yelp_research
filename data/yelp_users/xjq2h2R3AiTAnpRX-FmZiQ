Amazing food, amazing staff. Only one time did I go where I wasn't impressed. Top of biscuit burnt and chicken dry. Other than that food and service has been superb. Great comfort food and a nod to the south with the fried green tomato sandwich!!

Amazing food. Been here for years when they had Mesa location as well as Sullivan's pier too. It's too bad that closed. Well the fish is amazing. Just as you would find in the northwest. The hush puppies and zucchini are simply the best. You gotta try this place. Don't let the location scare you. It's next to Christies and Juicy Lucy's but completely worth it. Only thing I wish they had was homemade tartar sauce. The affiliated Sullivan's pier that used to be offered it for $.25 per one and it was fantastic.

This place is fantastic. I've been visiting their Julio Too locations since the original Julio G's shut their doors. For fast and casual Mexican food, nothing beats it! I couldn't live life anymore if I didn't have my fix every week.

I do agree they have some of the best green sauce but this restaurant fails in so many ways.   When you order you see the buckets of meat sitting there in open air behind counter. Second everything is microwaved. Have you ever microwaved shredded cheese on a styrofoam plate? It's not great.   Better options in old town include America's taco shop and Julio's too where dinner is actually cooked and not thrown on plate and microwaved. I wouldn't recommend it.

Cheap prices. Horrible food. This was my first time here living in Arizona all of my life. The fried fish patties are minced, not even filets of fish. It's like I bought them from Gordon's fisherman in the freezer section. Second the shrimp was all batter, barely any shrimp. I'm assuming that was minced too. I suggest going to Knock Kneed Lobster. Fabulous flaky fresh fish that I've been enjoying for years. If you're lazy and just want someone to fry your fish patties go down to Pete's and they will do just that for you.

I gotta give it to them. The pizza was amazing. Their salad was spot on and the dressing was home made. Other places should take tips on their food quality. This will be my go to place when ordering pizza. We had the deep dish Sears tower and it is now my favorite.

So I've been here twice in a week. I love some fish n' chips but most gross me out. I was skeptical of a new fish place coming to San Tan Valley but my mind has changed. Overall the food is great. The fish is cooked perfect and flaky. The only thing I don't like is the silver skin you see sometimes. I'd rather just see white flaky fish. The hush puppies are great and southern fried wings are fantastic. The amaretto dessert was killer. Think I'll be a regular here. I was too excited to eat before I realized I had forgot to take a picture half way through.
