I went in with a brake issue and it was fixed for a reasonable fee. They looked at everything else, told me what else needed fixing and gave me estimates for it all. Then they just did what I wanted. No pressure or guilt trips. That's what I want from a mechanic!

I'm sure the folks here mean well, but the place is dirty and the food overpriced. I had the gyro combo, who cost more than a dollar more if you get it after 3 pm.when I asked about that, the owner said the only difference invent meal is when you order it. Then why increase the price, man?!

I generally loathe salespeople and almost didn't purchase my iPhone yesterday because I couldn't do it online. I walked line the store ready to smack down the first pushy salesperson like an annoying knat. But my sales guy, Chase, completely surprised me. He saw that I knew what I wanted and spared me the upsell bull that makes me want to kill. He even pointed our a discount I was eligible for without me asking about it.  In the end, Chase made this a surprisingly painless deal. I don't know if the entire staff operates line Chase, but I know they should.
