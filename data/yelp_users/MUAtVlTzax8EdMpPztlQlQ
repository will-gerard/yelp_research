Wanted to try something new.  So i got a Groupon  to try out the sandwiches. Ordered a Staten Island (chicken) & The Taxi Driver  (pastrami). They were both really good, but the Taxi Driver was my favorite.  Cannot wait to come back and try it out again.

Love all the options We had the all you can eat soup and entr√©e deal for $7.99. Had the chicken soup, remind me of my grandma's chicken and dumplings, yummy. Hubby had the sausage soup, he loved it. And the breadsticks omg they were fresh and good. The Mediterranean flatbreads was good as well as the chicken piadina. Get there early to avoid the lunch time rush.

My husband and I wanted to go out on a date and decided to try out 5th Avenue and Wine in Scottsdale.  We had the Groupon for brunch on the weekend and arrived around 1pm on a Saturday.  The place actually had a nice decor and atmosphere.  The bar is upfront with a nice lounging area and a good size patio.  The bartender was very friendly and immediately greeted us at the door.  The bartender brought us menus to our table and explained a few things about the place...very good service so far.  We sat in front of the bar, at a table, and looked over both the regular menu and the separate brunch menu.  The prices on the regular menu was pretty high, but average for the area.  The brunch prices were not too bad and the all the items sounded interesting.  The support staff was attentive and brought us water.  Our waiter, Derek, was cordial.  Of course we had to try the Cobb salad, with fried eggs (2), as this was the picture on Groupon that grabbed our attention.  We asked our waiter, Derek, for his  recommendation for another dish to try.  He said he would recommend either the Chilaquiles or the Waffles.  Well, waffles are waffles, so we decided to try the Chilaquiles.  We asked Derek to describe that dish a little better and he said he would have to ask the chef.  Derek came back from the kitchen and said the dish was like "soggy nachos" with a fried egg...ok, that description should have made this choice an automatic disqualifier.  He reassured us by saying "don't think of it as a nacho though...it's really really good."  Ok, let's try it, since Derek seemed pretty excited about the dish.  We received our dishes promptly and the Cobb salad appeared to be similar to their picture on Groupon.  The Cobb salad tasted OK, but nothing special.  I think it was missing something like a good dressing.  On the bright side, the portion is large enough for 2 people.  The Chilaquiles looked like a sad and confused nacho dish that a culinary drop out would have experimented with.  This dish was simply a plate of tortilla chips dressed up with a single fried egg.  It was drowned with salsa verde sauce and tasted like wet card board...ok, never actually ate cardboard, but I imagine that's how wet cardboard would taste like.    The Cobb salad is $14 and the Chilaquiles was $13.  Neither one was worth the price and the Chilaquiles should not even be on the menu.  The atmosphere is the only thing that was nice about our visit.    I would not buy this Groupon again.

10am is the perfect time to come, after the morning rush. Today I tried something different. I got the new caramelized honey latte. It was amazing with soy milk. Yes, I come everyday I am a coffee snob, lol.

Never had Indian food. So many different things to try. The pita bread is to die for. I loved the vegetarian entrees as well as the chicken. The buffet is perfect to try a little bit of everything. Very clean! Affordable at 9.99 a person for all you can eat and everything was fresh! 2hrs after and anti-acids have been my families best friend

Came with the kids.  Service was slow and there were only 10 other people eatting , 4 tables. Waited 10 min just to order food, waiter walked by 3 times before he finally took our order.  Happy Hour menu is very slim, they really need to add more rolls. We only ordered las vegas rolls.  There are only 5 rolls to chose from salmon skin, spicy tuna, spicy crab, ca, and vegas. Rolls are 99% rice.   Next time I think we will go to chief ben. Better selection and faster service. Paid $25 basically for rice.

I love Mexican food! This is a great little restaurant that serves fantastic food. Chips and salsa, make sure to try the spicy salsa. Today we had the chicken taco, chicken enchilada, tostado and the red chilli carneta burrito.

Shelby was very helpful and recommend the burnt ends platter 14.99 so we took her advice and decided to share it. We order it with the spicy bbq sauce and got steak fries and mashed potatoes for our two sides. In addition, it came with a biscut with a yummy hunny butter. The burnt ends were melt in your mouth tender and the BBQ sauce has the perfect kick. The burnt ends were served on toast.   The kids each had the rib dinner 6.99. Which came with 3 large ribs and a side of bbq sauce. They both subbed the fries for Mac and cheese. And later shared a chocolate sundae 2.99

One Saturday afternoon, I jumped on the 'ol innerweb and bought two Groupons, one for a Mexican restaurant and the other for a Chinese restaurant.  Since it is an election year, we decided to put our democratic process to good use and we all took a vote...Chinese it was.  The Groupon that I came across was good for dinner and drinks for 4 people.  I never heard of Chok and Wok, but thought we can't go wrong eating Chinese food in the heart of Scottsdale, right?  We arrived around 6pm Saturday evening and located the restaurant next to NYPD (pizza)...they each have a small store-front/patio area and they were located in a strip-mall setting.  We walked up the little staircase, leading to the 2 chair outdoor front patio area and asked ourselves whether or not this was really a Chinese restaurant....from the outside, it looked like a cantina...hmmm, clue# 1.  As we walked inside to the reception area, we immediately noticed the distinctive smell of a gym locker...hmmm, clue #2.  A hostess/bar-maid/phone-taker greeted us and told us to seat ourselves wherever.  Well, first observations was that this is not going to be fine dining.  The restaurant had plenty of TV's positioned around, airing UFC fights and other sporting events, and the walls were decorated with skateboards...yes, skateboards.  If management was going for the dark and divey atmosphere of a grunge bar, then they have hit their mark.  As we looked around for a table, we figured that we must have beat the dinner crowd as there were plenty of tables to be had.  We chose a booth up front as this was somewhat away from the bar.  We were greeted by our waitress, who was cordial, but not very sociable.  I was not expecting to know her life story, but at least introduce yourself for Heaven sakes.  We informed her about the Groupon and she advised she needed to ask someone else as she was unsure what to do.  The other waitress came over and explained the Groupon was equivalent to $58 dollars for anything on the menu, including adult beverages.   I asked the other waitress what she liked and she recommended a "gummy bear"...ok, sounds interesting, why not, right?  My husband wasn't feeling so adventurous and he ordered a simple Bloody Mary, using a well vodka.  He asked the waitress to make his drink extra-spicey.  Not sure what the prices were for the adult beverages, but the Groupon included 4 drinks.  My daughter ordered the broccoli and chicken $8.99, my son ordered the teriyaki chicken with fried rice $8.99, my husband ordered the house chicken $8.99 extra-spicey, and I ordered the honey shrimp $11.99.  After giving our orders, our waitress had to come back a minute later to ask my husband what he had ordered because she forgot...clue# 3.  I know restaurants try to manage their overhead, but really, c'mon, make sure your wait-staff has a notepad and pen to write down the orders.  Food for thought, getting the food orders wrong will probably not make you employee of the month.  The dishes were cooked quickly, almost too quick, approximately 10 minutes from the time we had ordered it.  Each entree came out on individual medium-sized plates, each were just enough for a single person.  A big bowl of white rice was brought out and the fried rice for my son's teriyaki dish was brought out on it's own elongated-plate...the fried rice was plenty for 2 people.  I looked at my plate and  thought, 'wow, i scored, my honey-glazed, tempura-battered, shrimp were huge.'  As I took a bite, I realized the honey shrimp dish was in fact honey chicken...no wonder the pieces were huge.  However, I was not about to complain and have them remake it...I have always been fearful that the restaurant staff would do unspeakable and vile things to my food should I complain or have them remake my dish.  My husband's house chicken dish looked ok, it was just tempura-battered chicken, covered with a dark-thick sauce...at least it was chicken...so we hoped.  My husband said the house sauce was extremely salty and they forgot to make it spicey...on the bright side, they had a bottle of Siracha readily available. The broccoli and chicken was covered in a teriyaki sauce, but the dish tasted as if it had been sitting awhile.  The teriyaki chicken with fried rice was decent, only because they got the fried rice right.  Neither my kids really liked their dishes and they asked for their food to be boxed-up...which is code for we want to go home and throw it in the trash.    Our waitress redeemed the Groupon and told us it covered the entire bill...the best news of the night!  We still gave her a tip (yes, it was real cash money).  Oh well, we learned one lesson...the results of a Democratic voting process doesn't always give you the best choice.

Dr Alejandro is the best! Great with kids and adults. Very patient and caring. He actually takes his time and listens to you. He cares about you and your health! I recommend calling ahead to see how long the wait is.

Tried Yogis Grill for the first time around 3:30 & there were no customers. Was greeted by the cashier, who just got off her cell phone. The rest of the staff looked like zombies...no emotion or enthusiasm whatsoever.  Was seriously wanting to walk out, but thought I would give them a chance.  Saw they had our favorite roll...Vegas roll. Normally made with salmon, cream cheese, avocado, & cucumbers...fried & then drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  It was $8, but they charge an extra $2 for salmon...c'mon man, really? I don't mind paying $10 for a GOOD sushi roll, but there was barely any salmon and sadly no cucumbers. The roll is 8 pieces & as you can see, it's nothing special.  The taste ranks as the worst Vegas roll we ever had! This place is way over priced & is a wannabe Japanese restaurant.  Please do yourself a favor, avoid this place like zombies.
