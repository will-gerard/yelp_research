Absolutely horrible, The doctors might be OK but the staff is unbearable and completely unprofessional Fire them all and start over. They are condescending especially the person at the baseline office that answers the phones. I heard them laughing about me when they thought I was on hold. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I also agree with the previous comment they are never on time I have had to wait over 60 minutes.

A+ I like family owned businesses much better then franchises. Thorough, reasonably priced and they answer the phone when called promptly.

Food is to die for, Desert with hot salted caramel, pretzel, chocolate covered corn nuts and vanilla ice cream is great. Wait staff is fantastic great at giving suggestions.

Fantastic experience, Dr was great he gave me all my options from conservative toe Surgery and spent the time explaining pros and cons of each. I was told to call when I scheduled my MRI and they would schedule my follow up within 48 hours which is exactly what happened. Highly recommended!!!

I have to say this was a Great Dining experience, we went with 2 other couples so we were able to sample many items Starters were Mexican street corn this is a delicious unique item, we also had a Shrimp cocktail that was out of this world we spent 20 minutes trying to figure out all the favors, last was a bean and cheese appetizer on a cast iron skillet. All our meals were above average. The Carne Asada, & Carnitas were the favorite and we also tried enchilada's. Last the Margaritas are to die for. Pricing of $ 5-8  for appetizer's and 12-15 for full meals with enough for leftovers is completely acceptable.
