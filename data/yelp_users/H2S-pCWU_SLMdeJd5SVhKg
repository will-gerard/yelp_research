I tried this place for a late lunch today and all I can say it was very bland. The staff was great but the food....well not so much.

I love this bead store. As a bridal jewelry designer I mostly get my beads online because I have a wholesale license.  Having said that, you have to buy a boatload online to get the best price.   This place has saved my life a couple of times! I love the fact that Julie has it set up so you can buy just one or two beads if you need to. Sometimes while working on a piece I realize I'm 3 beads short! That is the most infuriating thing ever especially when you are in a time crunch. Sometimes you don't have the time to wait for 4-5 days for your order plus pay $6.00 or more for regular shipping for a tiny order.     So yes, Tommy S., she is going to be more expensive than say Michael's, who caters to mostly hobbyists and buys a bunch of cheap crap from China in huge volume. If you want QUALITY beads and beautiful unique findings this is the place to go.     FYI... Michael's and Joann's have also changed their silver components to silver plated from sterling AND raised the price! That really pissed me off so they will no longer be getting my business for emergency silver.  I would rather support a local business anyway, keeping the $ in AZ.    Julie has a huge selection of Swarovski Crystals that you can buy on the strand or separate, a gorgeous selection of sterling silver findings and Czech beads. She also has some delicas and lots of seed beads. She plays very beautiful cultural music and has the store arranged by color so it is always easy and quick for me to match something.  Julie really cares about her customers. She even has a "bead bar" where she will help you with your design! While I was there a woman brought in a necklace that she bought in Sedona. She was not a beader but wanted to make earrings to match it. Julie walked her around the store picking out beads that would go with her necklace, then brought her back to the bead bar and helped her make the earrings right there. The woman was so happy! Very fun place to shop I love it!  They even have a room in the back where you can have beading birthday parties for your daughter and friends. Fabulous idea for a birthday party!

We don't get all they hype about this place?! We are a 46 year old couple with no kids and dine out at least 3 nights a week. We love to try new places.  I always read Yelp for great, fun places to go for date night. This time I didn't have time to read the reviews but I had heard this place was on Oprah or the travel channel or some cooking show, so It's got to be great right?   This date night we had tickets to see Les Miserables at 7:30 on a Saturday for my Man's B-day. I called the restaurant on Tuesday to see about getting reservations for Saturday because I had heard about the nightmarish wait times because it is just THAT GOOD! They said they only allow 4 reservations and they were all full. Umm, ok...Well that's just wonderful. I explained that we were willing to come early so we could be through and get to Phoenix Theatre for our show. The woman said to call back at 4:30 on Saturday and she would tell us how long the wait would be. I did and we got in after 10 minutes! (at 5 pm) Yay! I thought, this is a great start to birthday night.    When we walked in it was extremely cramped, the tables are almost on top of each other. A very large man was seated behind us and I saw people just give up and go around. It was also EXTREMELY LOUD, the loudest place I have been in quite a while. We were seated right in the middle at a tiny table that barely had elbow room. I started to feel claustrophobic and couldn't hear a thing my man was saying and he couldn't hear me. I spotted and pointed to a newly vacant table in the corner and we made a mad dash for it. Ahhh... a little quieter but I still couldn't hear well.   Then I looked at the menu which was only about four choices of pizza to order from. I thought that we would share a pizza but when the waitress came by she explained that the pizzas were about the size of a dinner plate and most adults get their own. Then I looked at the price and about had a heart attack! Now, I am not a tightwad, I will pay dearly for excellent food. Then I was shocked to see that for the price we were going to pay the salads were not included? Really? This is a pizza joint, not the Four Seasons Resort.   The pizza came quickly. I was soooooooo disappointed. I am what you might call a pizza whore. I could eat pizza every day. I won't though because I would be huge. I ordered the Margherita and my man had the Sonny Boy. We were never served any bread and oil while we waited either. The pizza crust was so thin I bet I could have seen light through it and the sides were burnt.  I get the wood fired oven thing but this was ridiculous! There was a tiny amount of sauce, even tinier amount of cheese and 4, count 'em, FOUR pieces of basil. Now, I'm not saying it tasted bad after I broke off all the burnt pieces, it was just ok. It was nothing special and not worth the 40.00 we spent for 2 small pizzas and no drinks with tip. My hands were black and my man somehow got black all down his white sleeve. Then driving to the show in the car I noticed that I had black all over my neck! I know I really get into my pizza but come on! I shouldn't need a bath after. We won't bother coming here again because when we left I said to my man with a big grin on my face "I'm still hungry where should we go for dinner?" He laughed and said "Me too! That was a huge rip off for $40.00 and you leave hungry."  Our conversation was overheard by some guy and he said "I hear that a lot." Hmmmmmm

We Love this place! Although the food is to die for, and they have some good vegetarian options, my review will focus on the wine bar/entertainment.   There are very few places around town that a person who is not in their 20's anymore can get their groove on. This is it!   Va Bene is an upscale (read: no base ball hats) wine bar that has a full bar, a dance floor and a stage! The decor is very classy with deep red long velvet drapes. Seating is around the HUGE bar, tall tables that seat 4 with white tablecloths and intimate booths (yes, IN THE BAR!)  They have great outdoor patio space on 2 sides of the restaurant with heat lamps in the winter and a nice counter height fire pit.  Va Bene hosts the best bands around like The Soul Solution (these girls can SING!!) and the sax player Todd is amazing!) and Contra Band. The bartenders and wait staff are friendly and make really great drinks. Try the Chocolatini!  The crowd is a high energy, great mix of everyone and it can get quite crowded between 9 and 11pm. You will see anything from sequins to nice jeans to suits.  FYI  The 2 corner bar seats on the left are reserved for my friend Kiki and I when the Soul Solution is playing. If you sit there you will be glared at by everyone. Lol!

This is a great out of the way place that is Authentic! I hate Chains! The patio is very romantic and big and the food is really good! I've had the shrimp enchiladas, chicken chimi and many more wonderful dishes.  The fajitas! The servings are large and sometimes after all the chips and salsa which is really good I can only finish half my meal! There are two dining areas I prefer the one with the booths as its a little quieter. TIP: on Fri. and Sat. night there is a long wait so if you need to be at a movie or something go early about 6pm. Also the patio fills up fast! I have since moved to Boulder, but every time I come to Phoenix (which is a lot) I make the trip a little further south to come here and have never been disappointed.

I have been coming here for years and the place has been here for years so that says something. I love that it is not a chain and the breakfasts are very good, not greasy IHOP food. The owners really care about their customers. Our favorite dishes are the Montoya Skillet, the Peanut Butter Chocolate Pancakes, the waffles with FRESH strawberries. The side of potatoes are amazing! (order two!)  For lunch, I love the veggie wrap. Also, they have frequent diner cards.  I love the patio and the fact that they allow dogs. They even provide water for them which is a very thoughtful touch after a hike.  The two things I would change are definitely the bathrooms and the coffee dispensers. Only one person at a time in the bathroom. We are big hikers and the bike clubs frequent here as well. When a group is coming to breakfast from a long hike or ride, you really need more stalls! So if they would somehow reconfigure the bathrooms that would be great!  My other issue is that the coffee is always cold. Good but cold. We always get there later in the morning so maybe they just need better warmers in the coffee dispensers.  Overall, this is one of my favorite places. It's clean, comfortable, good food with healthier choices and the staff is amazing. It is a something for everyone place.

I had the most amazing veggie pita I have ever had here! The zucchinis, peppers, onions were grilled to perfection! Throw on some feta and tzatiki and I'm in heaven! The Greek salad was wonderful too,exactly what you would expect with that wonderful tangy dressing!

This place has the BEST hummus that I have found to date. Yeah, I'm kinda freaky that way, I only date hummus.  I called in a to go order on a Saturday afternoon so I could take a bunch of food to my friends house.  Everything was wonderful but I have had a better veggie pita at... wait for it...Gyros Express! But everything else I ordered here was better than there. The tzatiki and pitas were fantastic  The owner is a very sweet man named "Fred" I challenged that and said no Greek man is named "Fred". He laughed and told me his real name. This was a very tasty experience and we will be back! Thanks Fred!

This is by FAR, HANDS DOWN the best Greek restaurant in Chandler. The chef is from Cypress, that should tell you something. The ambiance is very romantic, dimly lit with pendant and string lighting at night. Bring your reading glasses if you are over 40 ;)  Get yourself a sitter and go out for a romantic night. This is the perfect neighborhood place for that. High top tables surround the perimeter and  a few regular height ones. They play wonderful Greek music too! There is a fairly large patio which I am going to rent out space in come fall.  Now for the food! OMG!! We have been here twice in 2 weeks because we are from Portland and are well, basically, Greek food whores.  We order the platter with all the standard Greek tapas like spanikopita and hummus and then split an entree which is perfect. The platter has  Baba Ghanoush , which is the best I have ever had in my life and the Dolmadas well, I felt like I was having sex in public. They are a little different, served hot, in a tomato base sauce that was very dark and Ah-Mazing! My man had the Chicken Souvlaki which he said was fantastic. It came with a side salad and lemon infused potatoes, which I had a bite of, and they were great.   I only have two criticisms and they were not enough to dock any stars just maybe suggestions for the owners.  We are also wine snobs. I know, you didn't see that coming right? Although they had one of my favorite Greek wines Boutari Naoussa (yes, those Greeks make some wonderful dry reds) the serving temp was too high. Even though it is a red, it needs to be a little chilled in the 50-60 degree range. AZ room temps in the summertime can be much hotter than that.  The other wish is that they serve a HUGE bowl tzatiki with the platter. They have it and it is fantastic but you have to order it separately.  This is a moderately priced, romantic place with fabulous food!

I used to love this place when it first opened and being a food and wine snob, I took all my friends and my parents here too when they were here from out of town.  It was nice and relaxing with great food.     Last night I was invited to my friend's birthday celebration here and I took my boyfriend. We were able to get one of the "Living rooms" out on the patio. Thank goodness because the music inside was so FU***** LOUD even on the patio I couldn't hear our group's conversation. We were all screaming at each other. The music was awful, too much base and a lot of percussion and not appropriate for a wine bar/happy hour crowd in their 30's and 40's where you go to be SOCIAL and TALK to your friends, not yell at them. I felt like I was in a club in Scottsdale for the 20 something crowd.   I yelled/asked our waitress if they could turn the music down and our dingy waitress yells back at me "WHAT?" I yelled back again and she said that they already turned it down. Amazing. Sigh............  We only stayed to be polite for the party but left after an hour because it was pointless to give them any more of our money for a disappointing time. I wanted to stay longer and catch up with my friends but we both were getting our nerves jangled.  The food has gone down in quality as well. Although my man loved the Tuna Melt Sandwich, the bruchetta used to be the best ever on the planet IMHO. Something has changed for the worse and there was no brie on the bruchetta that said there was brie on it.  I don't mind paying top dollar for great atmosphere and food but when you leave with more anxiety than you came in with and your ears are ringing there is a problem. The management needs to step up and re create what this place used to be.

Obnoxious loud music. The owners obviously have no clue what their business model actually is. Why would you set up quaint little living rooms within the living room for your customers if they can't hear each other talking? Isn't that what a wine bar is supposed to be? A place to relax with friends? I don't find it relaxing to have to scream to my friend who is sitting exactly 1 foot away from me. If we wanted to be assaulted with deafening, dreadful music we can go to a dance club. We asked the waitress to have them turn down the music and she screamed at me " YEAH, OTHERS HAVE ASKED TOO. I'LL TELL THEM AGAIN!" Very disappointing experience. They might want to figure out your business model.

OMG YUMMY!  OK, I am a self proclaimed "food whore" I could sleep in a pan of veggie lasagne!  Not only is the food awesome but it is LOCALLY OWNED!!!  Take that, salty Olive Garden and corporate America!  I have been here many times but I have to say taking someone who has never been and seeing the look after their first bite....Priceless!  I went with my "friend with benefits" and we had the best server! Her name was Misty and she was just the right amount of attentive, sweet and funny.   Knowing they bring out a salad and bread with olive oil first, I asked if they could put the salami on the side since I am a veg. Guess what? It came out on the side! AMAZING!   For our main courses, I had the eggplant and he had the stuffed shells. We each tried a bite of each others meals and I liked the shells as much as the eggplant! I have had the manicotti there too and it was great. So now I'll be in a quandary the next time I go, what to order? If THAT was my only decision in life!  This place gets really crowded on the weekends so go after 8. The house Chianti is really good too!

I am an artist myself so I was searching for someone who is an artistic/perfectionist like me. Colleen did an amazing job on my eyeliner. I am going back to get my brows done by her as well because she makes them look so natural by making them look like individual hairs, not that solid blue/black really fake look.

What a great menu! I stopped in for a take out lunch at 11:30 and the waitress/hostess was fantastic! I am a vegetarian and lactose intolerant so eating creamy or buttery sauces is out of the question. The waitress offered to sub the marinara sauce on the pasta primavera so that's what I ordered, for over $10.00. (a bit pricey for a vegetarian dish I thought)  While I was waiting I scoped out the full bar and inquired about Happy Hour specials. I was very disappointed to learn that there is NO wine on special for happy hour. (except for sangria) At an Italian place? REALLY????  This is why the 4 star review. UMMM... Hello Owners? Might want to change that if you want our happy hour business.The  $5.00 apps looked great and were priced well. They also do a couples "lunch special" for $25.00 for happy hour which does include ONE glass of wine.  The actual lunch specials were great bit expensive to me for just lunch at $9.00. A small pasta with salad or a small pizza with salad.   The restaurant itself was really done beautifully and probably even wound qualify for romantic at night if the lighting is nice and it isn't too loud.  I got my pasta home and was pleasantly surprised that included was some yummy warm foccicia bread with an olive oil, balsamic vinegar with spices dip! Thanks!  Oh, the pasta was wonderful and the portion was large enough so I have dinner tonight too! :)

We had been sitting here on this beautiful patio for at least 20 minutes when my boyfriend, who has a booming radio DJ voice, yelled across other diners to someone else's waitperson like a Wall Street trader doing a long shot purchase "EXCUSE ME, WE ARE READY TO ORDER!"   The salsa could use some heat and waaaaay less salt. They didn't bring little plates for the chips and salsa and they have those wrought iron mesh tables that you can see through, so of course the salsa is falling through the table onto our legs! All they had were these tiny cheap napkins!   We overheard the family next to us as they were eating their shrimp cocktails say "we don't have time to wait for our meals could you please cancel our order?" They had obviously been waiting to place their order as long or longer than we had.  Our order finally came and while the food was good it was extremely bland.  I asked if they had a spicier hot sauce or salsa and she said yes and brought me something equally as bland as the first two. So if you're looking for a nice atmosphere bland food and the worst service ever this is the place for you!

I had been a customer here  years ago and have since moved back to Chandler. I came back to Mixtures  because of Lori. She is very knowledgeable in bio identical hormones and the staff has always been very helpful. I called to refill my prescription and told them about the bad reviews on here that I was shocked about because I have never had a problem. Brittany said they had gotten a new system and they were having a lot of difficulty with it during the time the other reviewers had posted. Hey, that happens to every business, takes a while for the bugs to work out.

All I can Say is AWESOME. I am rating this a 5 star for flavor. Now my friends don't have to put up with my picky eating habits! Can you leave off the____, add some____ and some of ____ on the side?   If you are a sauce person like me, ask for more than one scoop or you will miss the amazing taste. I have never seen such a small ladle! They are quite stingy on the sauce so I ask for 3 scoops :) A bigger ladle perhaps?  Where else can you go to get whatever you want on your pizza and it is the perfect size for one person. Annnnnnnnnd has an awesome crust (not too thin) and FLAVOR!!! for $8.00? Certainly NOT Pizza Bianco!  It does get really crowded after 5 with screaming kids and soccer moms so we usually go mid day or get it to go. The line does go fast though. We were "gym shopping" the day we went for lunch. Yes I know, the hypocrisy was just oozing that day.   This is Noelle reporting from Chandler, AZ  YUM!  P.S. The photos on here are considered to be food porn by most Stoners so they should only be viewed by mature adults who haven't been smoking anything. ;D

OMG! THIS IS THE PLACE for an authentic NY Italian meal!!!! My man decided on a whim that I was going to try a new place after he had tried it for lunch. He said he couldn't wait to take me to Brooklyn V's.  I am a very picky eater and I am not a fan of chains so I was really happy to support a small business that really knows its business!  We started with these little bread things they call garlic knots that come with marinara  YUM! This was starting out fantastic. You can tell a lot from the marinara, ya know ;)   We each ordered a Stromboli and they were to die for! I could have cut it lengthwise and just crawled in, they do kinda look like sleeping bags. You know when you taste something so good the world just kinda stops spinning? Yeah......Oh sorry!  We took a tiramisu home to split for later. The waitress said it was heaven in a box. I haven't had too much luck with tiramisu here in AZ so I wasn't too excited. A couple hours later her words were still echoing in my head and I just had to taste it.  Fireworks shot off! The band started playing and suddenly I was in Italy! Reluctantly I put the other half (well almost half, he he)  back in the fridge for my man.  The liquor license is coming folks!

Yippee! I found a great hairdresser!  Her name is Jen Murray.  (FYI I am a former hairdresser I'm good with color but if you ever see me with scissors please run!)   My last hairdresser cut her hours and the last time overlapped the bleach on my highlights so I had some breakage and "instant bangs"... Sigh.....So that wasn't working.   Momentum Salon is right by my house, (Warner and Rural in South Tempe) a HUGE plus! You do NOT need to go to Scottsdale for a great stylist!  I walked in shocked at the beauty of the salon!  You really can't tell how large it is from the outside. I was offered water right when I walked in, that was a nice touch.  I explained to Jen that my hair always breaks off from the bleach for the highlights or pulls really red/gold and that was my biggest fear, having a hair color somewhere between Big Bird yellow and Animal from the Muppets red.  I really loved the job the Jen did on my hair! We did highlights and low lights leaving my natural color as the "third" color.  It is a very nice effect, very natural. It had been literally months since I had had a color and she matched the previous color exactly, less the bleach breakage LOL!  I am very happy with the quality of the work and I will go back to Jen.

Craving flavor?  Sooo excited that this place opened! We needed a new lunch place in Chandler. It's kind of hidden on the NWC of Alma School and Elliot but it will be your go to for flavor. It is mostly set up to be a take out place with a few tables. You HAVE to give this place a try, it's absolutely amazing! I have never experienced Jamaican food like this before, even in Jamaica. These women can cook! The fries with mango habanero sauce were the best I have ever had and hubby loves the jerk chicken. They have so many items to choose from, soul food like mac & cheese and classic Jamaican like rice and peas. They have vegan options as well. I spoke with the owners and they are going to be open for lunch Tuesday - Saturday 11 am until 6pm so you can pick up some dinner on the way home. They also do catering for big events like corporate lunches and weddings! Get out of your Taco Bell and burger rut and support this family owned business! Spread the word!
