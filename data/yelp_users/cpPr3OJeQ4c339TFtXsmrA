Such a great hike! This trail is pretty intense. Keeps your heart rate up, which is what I love about it. The trail is easy to follow and the steps make it easier to climb. The parking isn't great, it can get crowded quickly, especially with the nice weather. The summit has a great view of the valley and totally worth the heart pumping hike!

Love it here! Food court is amazing! The produce is always great and you can't beat their return policy. I had a bad batch of avocados and they returned them no questions asked. Always great customer service! Bathrooms always clean!

My favorite place in Arizona! Food is all delish! I've never ordered anything I didn't like. My personal favorite is the Ahi Tuna sandwich. I also recommend the Fontina burger. The flavors are incredible! If you're feeling like a salad, try the salmon caesar, it's super tasty! I can't say enough about the homemade pickles! I could eat a bowl of them, always order extra! The fries are superb! I love sitting outside most of the year. Kids can run around and play while you enjoy a delicious meal!

Double Double! Love In N Out! The service is always great and the food is delicious for fast food. We live in Portland now and miss having In N Out. We make sure to stop in anytime we visit family.

I just had a couple glasses of wine here but I was impressed with the service. I like the ambiance a lot. Quaint little place that I'd like to return to. It was perfect for our girls night, it was charming and quiet enough to be able to enjoy great conversation. They had corn-hole and patio furniture to relax in. I can't comment on the food, but I will be returning to check it out.

Let me start with saying that the start of our service was not great. We waited 15 minutes after being seated without any drinks or so much as a hello from a server. I decided to go ask the hostess if she could please send a server to our table. We waited another 5 minutes and still no one showed up. I then asked again (politely) to please send someone to our table, the hostess said she'd go get our server right away. He came shortly after and apologized for the delay. That being said, most of our food was delicious! The roasted  cauliflower with kale pesto is amazing! A must have in my opinion. The falafel burger is tasty too, the big slice of beet gives is such a great earthy flavor. Another must have is the tofu ban mi. The flavors on that sandwich are incredible. That sandwich is only on the lunch menu though, not dinner. Despite the service in the beginning, I will be returning. The food was overall tasty! I will add that our server comped our drinks and one of our desserts as an apology. He was great through out the rest of our time there and was very apologetic.

I went there for the first time and although the flavors of the bowl were tasty, I had a couple of issues with this place.  First off, one of the options to put in the bowl is the tuna, and everything is set up like a Subway or Chipotle, where you just select the items you want to add. I had planned to get a scoop of tuna, but I noticed there was a long hair in it. I mentioned it to the server and she just picked it out and didn't change out their bin of tuna.  I'm sorry, but that's not OK in my opinion.  I didn't end up getting the tuna. They were busy, but I don't think that's any reason to keep serving tuna that had a long hair in it. The server was not the friendliest either, she seemed annoyed that I even mentioned the hair.  My husband and I decided to still finish ordering, just not get the tuna.  Then we moved on to the other options that you can add, and I mentioned to the man who appeared to be the owner/manager, that it was my first time, and asked what he recommended to go with the salmon, octopus that I had chosen to get, he was very dry and just responded "whatever you want."  Again, not impressed.  So we paid and sat down to enjoy our bowls.  I took a couple of bites and I found a fish bone, it poked me as I took my bite.  I've almost chocked on fish bones, so I actually got a little nervous when I realized what was in my mouth.  Like I said earlier, the flavors of the food were tasty, and I was really hungry, so I decided to just keep eating hoping it was just a fluke.  A couple bites later and another fish bone.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back.  I was disappointed with my experience.
