The Old Spaghetti Factory is one of my fave place to eat and celebrate special occasions. I like the eclectic decorations and wood furniture ambiance of the restaurant. The meal portions are large enough for two. I often order the spaghetti with meat balls or with white clam sauce. There is always room for spumoni!

The trails are easy and nice to walk around. It's great for a beginner hiker. There are benches around the Preserve for scenic view. Sometimes, you have to sit down and enjoy the beauty of nature. It's surreal that there is a lush area by Wickenburg. It's fall and the weather was perfect when I went. Definitely, I would visit again.

I went at lunch time and checked out Maxim restaurant. I noticed they serve Chinese and Vietnamese dishes by looking at the laminated pictures hanging from their wall. Like any other Asian restaurant the wait staff, they speak limited English. The guy who waited for my was direct and ask what I want to drink not even waited for me to seat down and get comfortable. I decided to try the Bun with egg rolls dish.  I wasn't impressed with the restaurant d√©cor and cleanliness. I noticed the floor was dirty, needed to be swept and a staff was trying to take a nap on a table by the cash register.   When I received my order Bun with egg rolls, it was in a big bowl and the portion was right. It tasted good, it reminded me of the food on what I used to order from a Vietnamese restaurant from San Diego. Maxim food taste authentic and that's why they got 4-5 stars in yelp. But I was very disappointed on my final bill. The Bun with egg rolls was $5.50 price in their menu and I got my check was $6.50, I was surprised that I got charge $1.00 in taxes and Phoenix tax is 9.3%. The waiter, I think over charged me and didn't give me a sale of purchase receipt. I would not come back here again because I don't like getting cheated when it comes to money. That's why I gave them a one star. If you are going to try to eat at Maxim restaurant, ask for a receipt of your final sale and make sure they calculated your order right.

At first, I was hesitant to eat at Mister Wong's. I am being adventurous and eating out of my comfort zone. I ordered the hot and sour soup and the dinner lo mein combo. The soup didn't taste right, it was peppery and sweet. The lo mein dish is okay, nothing special. The restaurant is nestled in a shady area and inside of the restaurant is small. Overall, the food is okay.

Looking for that childhood toy that would rekindled pleasant memories? The Brass Armadillo specialized in nostalgia, antique and rare find items. Waking around and looking at all the items, itself it's a unique experience that would bring a smile. Who couldn't say no to a tin Cabbage Patch Kids lunch box from the 80's and Garbage Pail Kids trading cards? When you are shopping here be aware of impulsive buys.

Upon reading the Yelp reviews, I had to go here to see if indeed it's a scary place to dine. The restaurant itself has no windows, only the font door as form of outside light. As you come inside the restaurant, you can notice the minimum design on the walls and the never ending red carpet. The first dish, I ate was the hot and sour soup, the meat included in the soup was chewy and tasted old. I didn't eat much of it. As a parallel dish, the subgum shrimp tasted fresh, I liked the fresh vegetables in the dish. Overall, it's a typical Chinese American restaurant.

It's a good place to burn calories the day after eating a heavy Thanksgiving meal. The trails are easy to moderate. I like the serenity of the desert landscape. It's a great place to reflect and think about upon a new year. Definitely, it would be one of my favorite place to hike!

One of the west valley's great hiking place. And the good thing is, there is no entry fee!. Some of the trails are flat and goes into a nice incline. It depends on your condition on which route you want to go to. There are variation of hiking trails and it's well kept. In a nice clear day, you can see downtown Phoenix as a view reward. Visit early, because the parking lots can get full.

I was driving in my car on my way to a meeting and I noticed a sign "Bike Shop and Cafe." It was a warm afternoon and I wanted to cool off. Maybe they would have iced tea to be purchased.   As I walked inside the store you can smell the brand new tires from the bikes. I got greeted quickly by the store attendant.   I bought iced tea from the coffee bar side part of the store. It's a unique place to relax and they also offer free WI-FI. If you are in this area, go check it out!

If you need to relax after work and craving for margarita. This is the place! The bar is small and cute and the restaurant has a homey feeling. The service is friendly. They offer complimentary chips and salsa.  Las Fuentes offers different flavors of margarita! I tried the mango flavored margarita and I am hooked! The prices of the drinks are okay and they do offer discounted drinks during happy hour.

You get treated like family in Kawaii restaurant. The owner, builds relationships with customers by getting to know your family. That's why there is a lot of patrons coming back to this restaurant. You can tell by the picture postings in Yelp mainly customers dining.   The menu consist of Chinese  and Japanese food items. My favorite is the love boat. A large collection of sashimi and sushi rolls. It's so pretty to look at and yummy!

On a cool Monday afternoon in Phoenix listening to a busy street where cars pass by and the church bell rings every hour. Ahh! It's nice to sit outside and drink iced tea with honey. Listening to the surroundings and looking up in a clear blue skies. Just appreciating the day. Lola's coffee is not a typical chain of coffee shop but a nice place to relax and tuned down from a busy work day.

The restaurant is always busy with customers and the wait is long but the wait is worth it. We come here most the time. We love it! The buffet offers Sushi, Mongolian stir-fry and they would cook your steak on your liking. The buffet itself has a large choices of desserts, salad and of course Chinese food. A great place to bring friends and family from out of town and enjoy eating together.

I read an article about Revo Burrito in the Phoenix magazine and I wanted to check it out!  A different kind of a taco shop. The restaurant has great choices of healthy food options and I love their vegetarian burrito. The only thing that needs improvement is the customer service.

The food is okay and cold. They forgot my Oder =( I had to wait at least 20 minutes to get served. It was mind boggling because the girl in the behind the counter didn't noticed that my food wasn't serve yet and she is the one who took my money and I paid for my food. She had a very passive look and overall I am disappointed with the service and food.  The staff needs to revamp their customer service and communication skills. That's why I had to give Wholly Grill one star. I would not eat there again.

There is a Dunkin' Donuts inside the Cobblestone Auto Spa. I take my son there once a awhile for a morning donut date. My son totally loves the .99 cents food menu and the munchkins donuts. Inside the Cobblestone you can see from a clear window, the cars going through the car wash drive- thru. Attached to the clear window, there is an interactive wheel that you can squirt soap out, to the cars when they are being wash. My son loves this place and it's nice to relax with family in early Sunday morning.

This building used to be a Krispy Kreme donut shop. The new occupant is Carl's Jr. In my second time eating at Carl's Jr., on this location for lunch. This place is very clean for a fast food restaurant. When I was eating my hamburger combo. I saw one of the employee on her hands and knees scrubbing the tile floor with a scouring pad. Wow!

I saw the Tara Thai restaurant ad in the Phoenix New Times and it's a Thai buffet. So, I checked it out Tara Thai on yelp.com and see what the reviews are. So, far it gotten nice reviews from the locals and I noticed it used to be the Pink Pepper. I enjoyed the lunch buffet and the price is affordable.  But when I tried to visit the second time... It was sad to see posted on their door that Tara Thai could not afford to pay their lease and I think it's going to close down =(

This place is not bad! I was looking for a place to eat for vegetarian Monday's and not this place did not disappoint. I like the naan bread they served, it tastes like it's made within the facility. The naan bread is comparable color to Matzos but the texture is soft when you bite into it. I ate it with the curry dishes and the combination went well.  The curries and salad bar looks fresh in the buffet line. There are different sauces that you can add with your meal. The restaurant is clean and wait staff are friendly. I didn't have ask to refill up my water glass. They automatically check on your dining experience and making sure everything is okay. If you are looking for a colorful in your taste palette food this is the place.

Pacific Buffet is a SEAFOOD ORGASM restaurant. I was very surprised with the choices of authentic food from escargot to frogs legs but not my favorite. They do offer variety of Chinese dishes in the buffet line and a salad bar. The sushi bar is awesome, it shaped like a boat. Bring a hungry stomach because you can get full fast by just eating sushi. The price is a little up there but it's worth it for a special occasion. The crab legs tray gets empty fast by hungry patrons but it gets replenished quickly. Make sure to try the Hibachi grill. You can pick and choose fresh ingredients and the chef will cook it in front of you.   If you want to try something new or just wanting eat to all you can eat crab legs. This is the place to go.

Have a Kupcake Kind of Day! Greeted by the writing on the purchased receipt. As  you walked in the bakery, it smells so good! Throughout the facility, is the smell of the aroma of cake essence.  I tried two cupcakes so far and I am truly addicted. I gave four stars because I am in a cupcake challenge to try all of the flavors!   I will update my review, when I've tasted all the cupcakes.

The store is simple and not overwhelming with Asian products. You can pick out ingredients that your missing from a dish and check out. I like the fact that it doesn't smell fishy inside. The aisle are well stock with ethnic food and good selection of frozen products.

Like the weekly Yelp, 'Been there, Thai'd That!'. The buffet lunch time and the food items consist of curries, soups, stir fry noodles and rice. And many more. I been dining here several times and I haven't been disappointed yet. The wait staff are friendly and have good customer service. If you like like Thai food this a great place to eat.

Like a Kung Fu movie, there is the master and the student. The student found the temple of beads. As you enter the temple your are greeted by the master. There are tests to prove yourself worthy of the skills:  1) Here are beads and earring head pins. Show me how fast you can make earrings?  2) Young grasshopper, you must choose your tools. The pliers and wire cutters.   As the journey begins, the student must practice then skills of patience, coordination and creativeness.  Store review:  Bead Unique offers array of beads. There are classes offered to master making earrings to necklaces. I was very impress with Zina, she sat in front of me and showed me how to make an earring step-by-step. She showed patience and gave me personal attention until I got to make a complete earring from scratch. I felt good afterwards that I accomplished something. May be this new hobby will unleashed my jewelry making creative side :)

This Fry's store is one of the best that I've shopped at. It is located in a retirement community. The food court has variety  selections of food, from bbq ribs to ramen soup (yes, ramen). The store is clean and good customer service.

The restaurant is clean and modern. The wait staff are courteous and speak good English. I like eating here because the food reminds me of "Little Saigon" in Orange County. The dishes itself are good for two people. Sometimes, I can't finish my meal; however more for me later :). I leave the restaurant with full of satisfaction. I would definitely give Pho 602 Vietnamese Restaurant four stars!

Guys with man buns sporting beards, the ladies wearing plaids and overalls. The DJ is playing mashup genre from the 40's, 50's, 60's coexist with current top 40 music. And wait there's more, a music room for bands to play indie reggae with electronic beat.  Where am I? This is not a bar in Scottsdale. It's located in downtown Phoenix.   X marks the spot. Curiosity sparked my interest to find this place. Follow the crowd of people going into a alley. It's scary at first but the part of the unknown and yet to come. It's a good indicator you are close to the bar.   The bar/lounge have the ambience of combination of artsy, hipster and indie crowd. No fancy decorations but fun old school games. I like the most about this bar is the music venue and anvangarde of authenticity.

What a jewel of a establishment in the downtown area. To have an awesome place and play classic arcade games. The nostalgic games that are offered for enjoyment are Centipede, Street Fighter, Ms. Pac-Man and many more. If you're looking for something different of a bar ambience, this a great place to visit. The best part is when you check-in at Yelp, you'll receive 10 free tokens!

The ice cream rolls that hits the flavor notes in your tastebuds! I tried the banana cream pie flavored ice cream roll, it was decadent and rich. There is a menu available or request a flavor that you want to get made.   Nino (owner), I had a chance to talk to him about on how he came about the business. He told his story that he saw a video on YouTube, that's what he wanted to do. And he opened the first ice cream roll business in Phoenix. What a nice person to converse about the possibilities  on the different flavor ideas that he has for ice cream rolls. Definitely, I am coming back to satisfy my sweet tooth!

Spice it Up! A Yelp Elite Event is a great way to encounter new restaurants and establishments. At this YEE, was held at Inchin's Bamboo Garden. Talk about piquant entr√©e dishes. When I tasted the food, It was like  a gossamer of spices that entangled my tastebuds. The appetizers and main dishes will hit flavor notes. If you are looking for new place to eat and adventure out of your comfort zone. This a good place!
