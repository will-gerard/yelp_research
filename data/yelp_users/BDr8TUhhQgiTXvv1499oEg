Oh how I love this place. The food is fantastic and you diffently get plenty of it! This is the only place to go in Arizona for chicken fried steak. My girlfriend had the rib-eye lastnight and it was pretty good, but like I said this place is best known for the chicken fried steak and mashed potatos.

I'll start by saying the service was great. Drink prices were good. But for three people to go and spend $75 is not your $ that you give it.3 drinks for $10= good. The rest of my tab was for 36 wings, burger, rings and sweet potato fries. Now compared to other bars like Tailgaters the same order of food plus a bucket of beers and 4 Malibu n Cokes = $45 with food being just as good. So if you want bar food this is not the place to go. By the amount of empty seats the problem is your food pricing. Your a bar not a fine diner!

I really enjoy this place. It is always busy and the food and service are great. It's the small town resturant in the big city.

Not sure what is going with this place but the quality of food is going downhill! Ordered a taco salad and got a half-full bowl. By the time my girlfriend got to this half-full bowl the undrained juices from the chicken had turned the shell into complete mush. She couldn't even finish this half-full taco salad. Not sure if you got new staff or are just trying to cut corners, but this is not the quality of food I'm used to getting from this place.

Well I went to order from your company online because you delivery says $20.00 order not specific for food only.. Then to be called and told that my order needs to 20.00 for food only and the rudeness of the meal man which I'm assuming the company you signed with was a mistake on your part because him and his staff are very rude!! I'm one person and 20.00 of food for myself would be wasting food and money!!! I'm sorry but I will not longer be coming into your restaurant to get food and I will be blasting this on all social net works to let them know that the meal man is s rude person and any business that use him should be boycotted. If you were smart you would find someone else to to your on line and delivery service for you!!!

Gave the "new" Satisfied Frog a try last night and I must say it was pretty dang good! The new owners worked at the old Frog for ages and brought that tradition to this new location. Give them a try.

Every time I drive by this place it's packed. So we decided to give it a try. The burgers are good, big and you can get your buger your way. The fries are fresh cut and you're informed of where the potatos are coming from that are making your fries. A small order of fries severs 2 no problem. Can't go wrong at this place... Will be back for sure

Since we don't have the time to tend to our yard as we should, it's great to know that I can call on AMS to take care of all of our yard needs. The staff is very professional and polite. They are very affordable in these tuff economic times.

Never heard of this place tell I saw it on the side of a NASCAR and the following day a TV ad, I knew I had to give this place a shot.   Went there yesterday and had the #9 on wheat bread and it was good, went back today and had the #9 on the french bread and it was fantastic. This place is a must if you are looking for a great sandwich. Eli you'll enjoy it!

This place doesn't compare to the Two Hippies on 16th St. This place seems to always be empty or closed. The staff is not as friendly either. While I was there another couple came in and waited 5 min before they got any service and then left empty handed. Just a word of advice you need to make sure every customer leaves with something if you expect this place to remain open. I live 3 blocks away from this one and will drive to 16th St. one if I'm in the mood for Hippies again.  7/14/2011 Steph H who is one of the owners who wrote a review above mine I'm sure to get the ratings up, which Yelp frowns upon if you read the print in the comment block.  Steph H sent me an email because she didn't like what I saw with my own eyes and simply stated my OPINION which is what Yelp is about simply stating ones OPINION of ones vistit to ones business. Anybody knows business 101 the customer is always right.  With todays economy Steph H you should be doing everything possible to make sure all your customers are satisfied with there visit to your establishment.
