Pretty freakn fabulous. Celebrated an anniversary dinner here last night and showed up an hour before the dining room even opened. Thankfully they had their terrace room open and enjoyed the crisp air, views, some wine and Kobe sliders while we watched the sunset...delicious!! This is definitely not some place we can afford to eat all the time and being the youngest couple there I'm so happy they really went out of there way to make our night just as memorable. Every single staff member checked on us, made us feel welcomed, joked and laughed with us and we got so many "happy anniversary" wishes, just super great. They serve food you normally see in movies or on cooking shows, super fancy so I was praying that everything would be good and enough to eat. I loved it because we were able to have two appetizers, two entrees, and two desserts plus 3glasses of wine (about $180 total for what we got) and we were so full after, it was great to be able to try a bit of everything unlike most restaurants where you can't even stomach dessert after your meal.  All in all customer service was on point and the views were truly amazing, I didn't want to leave. It is a beautiful romantic spot and we will definitely be returning, hopefully asap!

Clean, friendly, and efficient...a little too efficient. I know it's a silly complaint to have but the sandwhich artists are so fast and they have roughly 5-6 people behind the small counter (or the register is slow) that it makes it incredibly awkward when you're at the beginning bread station and you're having to yell over another customer's shoulder because your sandwich is at the other end by the condiments. I wanted to try some new toppings on several occasions but the checkout line is always slow and when I asked the guy to wait until I could get closer to actually see what they had he looked impatient and antsy so I always just end up spouting off random ingredients from memory, kind of a bummer and hate being rushed like that.

DIRTY!! Both the floors and bathrooms, who knows about the kitchen. Just in the bar area alone you could see, from the waiting area, napkins, fries, chips, crayons, even an eaten rib on the floor!  Went and used the restroom and you could see scuff marks and napkins all over the floor, plus no where to hang your purse, disgusting, it's like they don't even care!  After seeing all of that we definitely didn't want to eat there, walked in then right back out. Chili's seems to have lower their standards over the years :( left dissapointed and hungry.  Thankfully with so many other restaurants in the area it was easy to find somewhere else to better spend my money.

This is the best Hooters location I've been to in AZ!  Server: Desiree Time & Date: Thursday Nov. 27th at around 6pm   Environment:  Very clean, and the outside patio has the comfiest seats too!   Service:  I've been to several Hooters before, and being a woman it can be a little awkward at times. I have either encountered the stuck up servers who can't remember or get an order right to save their life and I've also had the servers who try to invade my personal space while calling me "sweetie" or "hun" for a better tip.  Finally I have arrived at a place where they treat you like normal human beings!   My waitress was so kind, she opened conversation not by "what do you want to drink" and rushing away but by approaching me with a smile and a "how was your day". And I can tell you that after a long day at work that was really refreshing to see and that kind of customer service goes a long way.  She was also very attentive, checking several times to make sure our food was hot and to our liking and that our drinks were always filled.  The manager even stopped by to see how everything was.  Great service and I will definitely be back!  Thank you!

I chose the Phoenix Tattoo Company because of all the great reviews and left disappointed.  Yay or Nay:  Marko was a really nice guy, the environment was fairly clean, and I was so impressed when I saw his shading work on my friends flower piece who had gone before me that I had no doubt he would be able to handle three lines around my wrist. Unfortunately I ended up leaving very unsatisfied in the job done.   Price:  What added insult to injury was that he let my friend haggle a lower price ($130 for a softball-sized, black and grey shaded flower-over an hour). I realize people need to make a living but I was hoping he'd realize his mistake by charging $100 (three thin lines around my wrist - 10min) Really??? Now I have to go pay the same amount if not more with a different artist to get it fixed elsewhere.   **I uploaded a photo (assuming it's not removed by the business) of the line-work on my wrist. The photo was taken two days later. He did not do the heart, only the three lines around it.**  Overall: I've had bad tattoos before and getting tattooed is not new to me. Marko was definitely a down to earth guy and maybe what would have made it better is if he just admitted he messed up, came down a lot in price or offered to fix it somehow. But what really makes me upset is that this is on my wrist for all to see. It's embarrassing.   I wanted to love this place but I don't want someone else to leave the way I did.  Sorry but I won't be back and I don't recommend  Phoenix Tattoo Company.

Literally sitting with an employee (Jessica) telling us to move somewhere else. Saying how Aventura is "just standard" and looking up other apartments she was raving about on her own computer for us... Um that's got to say something about the apartments. Clearly the people that work there are even downgrading themselves! So shocked I was out of there practically running!

Don't you just love it when... You walk into a restaurant and you're treated like family.  Let me explain... Was introduced to this place by my boyfriend who had frequented this marvelous place in the past. SO happy to have found a solid mexican restaurant.  It's tucked away and doesn't look like much on the outside but the service is always so friendly and they always go above and beyond, plus it just feels like home.   Tip: Ask for a side of enchilada sauce with your meal then proceed to drizzle that on everything, amazing stuff, I seriously wish I had the recipe!

Better Italian food at Olive Garden and that's saying a lot!   New to the area I decided to give this place a try and unfortunately it'll be the last time.   Happy hour is not happy hour, the waitress who wasn't familiar with the menu had to keep coming back and telling me all the things I couldn't get. Not a great business strategy.   Worst of all I couldn't customize my order which was shocking. You'd think if I could have a burger made my way at a fast food joint that they could customize your meal for the price you're paying here! So be careful if you are allergic or really dislike certain foods. It also worried me that the food isn't being cooked to order because of this and perhaps just frozen bulk that's reheated.   I ordered the spinach manicotti which I forced myself to finish because I felt bad for my friend who had offered to pay.    The food was lukewarm at best, not presented well and I felt ill after it all.  I won't be returning, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area to choose from.

Always good food but they must not get a lot of to-go orders. You can only pick up on the side at certain times otherwise you have to wait in line, and sometimes you are standing there waiting for someone to help you. I know the lines here get very long, that's why I call in ahead and want to be able to grab and go but it's always a running joke in my household with how long it takes to get food here. Also sometimes the to-go orders are packaged sloppy or not nearly as nice looking as if you would get it when dining in. Staff is okay. Food is great though, worth it.

Came here about a month ago when my toes and heels needed some TLC. I was worried by the low stars and almost didn't go in because of it, but the prices were great and I didn't need anything crazy done, just a quick pedi, in and out during my lunch break. I gave it a shot and I think I got lucky getting Jessica. She was very nice, friendly, not rough or rude. We even talked a little bit about the tattoos I had in my feet, she was definitely probably the youngest nail tech there but it was refreshing to have someone that could talk to me not like some nail salons that can seem stand-offish or judgy. She did quick, clean work (from the time I say in the chair until she finished was about 30min for the spa pedicure), and the rough spots on my feet and heels were all nice and smooth. I was so happy with the service and relieved it wasn't as bad as everyone says it is because I know it can be awkward sitting in silence, or asking for something you want done when going to nail salons so I was happy I could relax. My toes still look great and I will definitely book an appointment with Jessica again if I'm able.

I've been going to Mimi's since I discovered them in '06 and my visits have now become very few and far between.  Long time customers could probably agree that the customer service in most places is like a casino game, you get lucky every once in a while but most of the time it's a shot in the dark. Also the prices have gone up while the quality and quantity goes down. And for someone like me who had a "usual" it was very surprising to see the kinds of changes being made over the years.   Also...don't go past 7pm, you'll get left with the slim pickings. I had a Ceasar salad so soggy and the croutons were not fresh, you could squish them with the fork. Thankfully when we showed the manager she didn't charge me for it. The evening staff is also a younger, not very experienced group. We were sitting in the booths next to the kitchen and we could here them joking and cussing with eachother. They also left some guy waiting with a to go order over 5min just to fetch change they clearly forgot. So there was more than one person who left disappointed.  I used to really like this place, but I definitely think tonight Is the last time my family and I will be returning. Sad and done giving this place second and third chances...

Don't you just hate it when... A company denies responsibility and won't admit that they messed up.   Let me explain... Referred to this company by the Volkswagen dealership on Bell Rd. This will be the last time we trust anyone other than a dealership on our vehicle and hesitant to even trust any future Volkswagen recommendations.   It all started when we needed a hitch installed to tow a trailer across country. I was quoted a great price and told it would take no more than a couple hours. After waiting there for 4 hrs, no one came by with a status or an explanation on why it was taking so long, so I just called there phone to get their attention and was told it would be an additional 2hrs for a service they do all the time.  Finally they were finished and the next day we headed to U-Haul to get the trailer attached to our hitch. Once they put it on and got to testing the lights, they informed us that the wiring had been done wrong, the right blinker was showing left and the left for the right. So we called Quality Bumper back to let them know we were stopping by to get the job fixed to which they told us "well it's probably U-Haul's equipment, sometimes it's old and they don't switch them out but yeah we can take a look."  It sounded like they didn't want to take responsibility but we also didn't want to drive thousands of miles with faulty wiring and we wanted to be sure.   We showed up and a younger guy ran out to check the blinkers with a little device and told us that they were correct. So on the way back to U-Haul we decided to stop at another U-Haul location close by to have them double check really quick. Two different employees checked and they confirmed and showed us on their devices that the wiring was wrong. We were extremely frustrated that they just didn't want to admit that they wired it wrong and/or were too lazy to fix it. We drove back and spoke with the manager who, after checking himself, confirmed the wiring was wrong and had it fixed.   Several months later we took our car through a car wash and noticed our entire trunk area and back seat floor were soaked in water. A week later we tried again and were still accumulating water from somewhere. We took our car back into the dealership to basically dissect the trunk area and find out where the leak was coming from.  Turns out Quality Bumper was to blame. What should have been a quarter size hole to fit the wiring/harness through turned out to be a giant gaping hole cut into the car the size a two decks of cards. It was causing water to build up and flood the car floor. The hole was so large the dealer told us there was nothing they can do or use to form fit the hole with anything.   DO NOT take your car here. I don't understand how a company could do that to someone's vehicle. We were taken advantage of and don't have the funds or the time to be given the runaround. We take pride in our cars so that we can keep them for a long time and it was heartbreaking to have this happen knowing there's nothing that can be done, we were out of luck.  (We will be notifying Volkswagen as well as the BBB. Also posting a picture of the discovered damage.)   Another similar customer experience on the BBB site: http://www.bbb.org/phoenix/business-reviews/truck-accessories/quality-bumper-co-inc-in-phoenix-az-2274/customer-reviews#.VT22Hpd3gSE.gmail

The business itself is very clean, big, open and inviting.  From reading other Yelp reviews I decided to call ahead to make an appointment (even though I'm sure walk-ins are welcome) that was best as to not surprise anyone and so you are seated quickly. The massage chairs were really nice and looked new. I went in for a Basic Pedicure which from the time of my appointment until the time I left was about 50 minutes. My nail tech was really quiet and didn't talk much at all, granted it was my first time there, it was just a little awkward so I spent the time taking notes for this review on my phone while I was getting the Pedi done.  I believe I had Rose, she was very sweet though and did an excellent job for the price! The hot stone massage was heaven and just what I needed, I found myself wanting to fall asleep. All the people that came in while I was there seemed like regulars (and in their late 50's) half were men, which I rarely see at nail salons but I guess that's Scottsdale for you. I would definitely recommend this place and will be returning as soon as possible. I'm so relaxed now I think it's time for a nap! :)

I live an exit away I can't believe I'm just now coming here after 4months. Food was delicious, nothing fancy or pretty just tastes great. Raymundo was our server and he was so nice! All the waiters and waitresses seemed friendly and close as they joked with one another and working quickly but very well together. Customer Service is more than half of the reason I keep coming back to places. You either got it or you don't and this place has it!

I live in the apartments across from here so I can't help but come here when I am craving wings, it's so convenient!  But I'm not going to sugar coat it...the service is horrible. On more than one occasion I see servers standing around talking or huddling in a corner, not checking on customers, or looking like they would rather not be there (and I'm sure they don't) but that attitude reads all over your face and body language and really turns customers off...killing the entire experience.  Now when I crave wings I just order to-go and skip the drama.

Food has always been above average here but the manager here (tall, older man) isn't so friendly! Have a seat, here is why:  Being the techies we are we were excited to see that they had a mobile app now where you can pay your check with Apple Pay! The waiter dropped off the ticket but all we had to do was pull up our table number, check out, and was emailed the receipt fairly quickly.  I then opened the check on the table and noticed a different amount than what I had paid. The waiter simply forgot to add on an extra Coke and did so last minute that it didn't update in the app. I notified the waiter and was thinking all we owed was the extra $3 for the soft drink and would have been fine paying that separately. The waiter went to see what was going on but the manager returned. He started by suggesting possibly doing a second charge on the physical card to see if it actually went through and if I ended up getting charged twice then they'd refund one. I frowned upon that simply because I'm not going to make another large charge on my card just to "see what happens". I pulled up the receipt that was emailed to me by BJ's showing everything I paid for, it was just short the $3 drink.   The manager then sat down next to me at our booth, without asking, to look at my phone. I felt EXTREMELY uncomfortable because there was really no room for him so his arm and leg were brushing right up against mine. It was so unprofessional and a complete invasion of privacy and I shot a horrified look at my boyfriend on the other side. Quickly I showed him the email on my phone hoping he would be satisfied and move away from me, but it was like he had never seen an email like that before...I had to explain that it was sent front BJ's and where it said I used Apple Pay.  I even offered to show him my bank account...something I shouldn't have to do or feel that I should defend myself with but we weren't going to be painted as thieves. At this point he was still rudely hovering over my phone I had to obviously turn my phone away so he wouldn't see me entering in my credentials. He finally got the hint and got up to go check to see if it was showing as paid in the system yet.  I pulled up my account and sure enough it was showing as being taken out and pending, it was incredibly awkward once again to have to show a view of my account transactions and prove we were not trying to skip out on the check. Sorry but I'm not going to charge my card again when we have all kinds of proof showing we've paid and we weren't trying to screw anyone over. The manager simply said "well it's not showing as cleared so I'm just going to have to eat the check..." and as I was about to speak he walked off without another word.  We just sat there in silence for a bit as the manager stared at us from the front desk.   Sir...you're not "eating the check" as you passive aggressively stressed to us. You got paid, the money didn't just go into oblivion from my bank account, the BJ email receipt confirmed it, you were just short $3 for the Coke which we were happy to pay for on a different ticket.  The waiter, a kinder soul, came back a few minutes later and I gave him the quick rundown of what happened because I certainly didn't want him getting the blame for the last minute addition. He went back to check the register and BOOM it was now cleared and he said that we were all good. It just took a little time to get updated apparently but the manager clearly lost his cool early and lacked a sense of boundaries with customers.   After an already long day and wanting to just sit down and get a good meal somewhere nice it was a real disappointment to then be hassled for something that was no fault of our own. We were the ones that brought up the issue and asked what we could do to remedy it not expecting the manager and how we'd ultimately get treated. I was just happy to be done with something that could have easily been solved...a measly $3!!! It wasn't that hard.  Will be reaching out to corporate regarding the personal space issue though, an apology from the manager would have been nice at least as we left.   We've come here for many birthdays and get togethers, however this customer experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and won't be recommending this place again.

Showed up over the weekend excited for sushi! We hardly venture out and try new places but discovered this place just by driving through the community so this was a rare treat when we decided we'd finally stop by last Sunday to try this place out. Showed up at 1pm only to see a huge CLOSED sign up front and walked up to the door to check the business hours, Sunday's are 3-9pm not 11-9 which Yelp shows. Fair enough, we had our hearts set on this place so we drove home for a couple hours and came back at 3. Still closed? My heart sank. There were a few people in black shirts sitting out front smoking and on their phones, weren't sure if they worked there or were waiting for someone to open up. We waited out front for another 15min to see if if anything changed but sadly gave up and ate at one of the restaurants next door. I also tried calling several times, nothing... Sadly even when we were done eating at Old Pueblo we stopped by to see if they had finally opened and the sign was still up, completely dark and no one inside. So I'm not sure what's going on, not open during advertised business hours, maybe they are completely closed, who knows? I'll update if we ever get a chance to go back and actually try this place.

This was my first time experiencing Massage Envy and I ended up trying out both the 1hr Massage and 1hr Facial the same day. Here's my experience:   First up was my massage with Linda Lee. This sweet, though quiet, asian (sorry I'm assuming) lady, lets you know right off the bat that this was going to be legit! :-P  I'd take her over some teen right out of massage school any day! Haha, ok but seriously, she was amazing. I've had many a massage in the past but she was very thorough and excellent pressure throughout. She really made sure to focus on the areas I mentioned. I'd definitely recommend her.  Second, and the reason I deducted a star, the Facial with Megan. It was very "fumbly" and awkward at times. Again, I have had facials before, and while every place has their unique twist they generally all follow certain steps. She was running 10min behind to start things and I almost asked if I should reschedule, thank fully she made up the time in the end (hopefully not shorting someone else). She accidentally "massaged" my arm with cleanser instead of lotion. Later she said she was putting moisturizer on my face and then wiped it off with a cold wet towel, I was confused at this point. Also, a product she recommended in the beginning of the facial she never even used and then suggested I buy it. In the end I left thinking..."that was it?".  It was an okay facial but I've had much better at other spas in AZ.  While she was very sweet and apologetic for most of the blunders it took away from the spa experience and when you're deciding what to spend your hard earned money on, unfortunately the mistakes turn you off.   The front staff is very friendly and not overly pushy about trying to hassle you for a membership which I appreciate, it makes me want to come back instead of scaring me away.  In my head I kind of made this out to be a little competition. If I was going to become a member and could only choose either the Massage or the Facial once a month...at the end I chose the Massage. It's in the name of the company, it's what they do, so I'm sticking to what they know best.  Great relaxing experience overall, try it!

PROS: I just had a massage with Candy who is amazing and possibly the most kind, courteous, professional and attentive massage therapist I've ever had. We talked about our lives, laughed and she made me feel SUPER comfortable, which above anything else, is key not only for me but in the massage industry I think. Great pressure and balance, I would highly recommend her!  CONS: I really wanted to try the Hot Stone upgrade but unfortunately they don't tell you anywhere that it takes 2hrs for the stones to heat up so make sure you mention that ahead of time :(

Took our dog in because he was having troubles walking suddenly. It was about 7:30pm on a Tuesday night and no one in there at the time. The front desk attendant Michelle was super friendly. I was cautious only because I've had other people come here many years ago and they told me about how they wouldn't even see your pet without getting money upfront first.  Things must have changed because I kept waiting to immediately hand them money, instead they showed us back to an exam room. We had dr. Harrigan and she was also very friendly, handled our little guy with care, and very confident in her diagnosis.  Because we had a healthcare plan we took him to Banfield in the morning but Dr. Harrigan was able to correctly pinpoint the area of concern, which later showed in X-rays. They gave him some pain meds and an injection to help him until the morning.  It can be expensive but it's like any emergency, even if a human had to go to the ER it's a lot more for X-rays at a hospital (even with insurance). They at least do the exam ($95) and give you options on what else you want to do and how much it would cost so you can decide what's best. Grateful that they treated my dog so well, were gentle and didn't rush.

You really can't go wrong at any discount tire location, I've never ever had a bad experience, but Orlando S., the asst. manager in Avondale, is simply the best! Excellent and friendly customer service every time. So happy they honored my appointment first thing, since I was on my way to work and they always have walk-ins waiting outside in the morning. They're never pushy, get the job done great and fast too!  I was literally standing there watching all the customer interactions going on and the hustle these guys put out and wondered what they are doing differently that other companies aren't. I've seriously never seen such amazing care and respect for the customer all with a genuine smile and diligence.

Any other Apple Store is better than Arrowhead by far.  We've always had issues with the place whether be buying, repairs or returns I've never been treated so poorly as a customer. Needed a refund for a brand new machine, with a receipt, it's not complicated. We told them we got it at the Scottsdale store the day before, the receipt showed both an old and new machine with different serial numbers but they clearly just couldn't figure out what to do or want to take the extra step to find the solution.  Immediately got on the phone with the Scottsdale store we got it from, they even confirmed the receipt over the phone drove all the way out there and seriously in less than 2min they handled everything no problem and we got the refund.  Save yourself the stress of dealing with this Arrowhead store, until they start training their employees to represent Apple better, and go to any other store in the valley, you'll be glad you did.

Two words - Greek fries! Start off with that and end with some baklava to share and your night will be just right.   Service was a little slow and it was hard to get refills and order tings in a timely manner which is the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. But the servers there are nice and the food is so delicious! I'm a VERY picky eater, I could eat things plain if I had to and the though of lamb makes me cringe but this place really opened me up to some great flavor combinations.  A must try at least!

Amazing customer service paired with delicious food! Major kudos to the managers here. You'd think this would be a no-brainer for food joints but not many managers are as hands on as these guys. They help at the register, bus tables, and even get on the grill! They're handing out coupons, talking with customers making sure everything is great, it's just been a great experience every time I've visited. Rosemary smash fries are the bomb too!!

Don't you just love it when... You can trust a stranger with one of your most valuable possessions.  Let me explain... It seems most of the bad reviews seem to be with sales but I've had a great experience in the service department working with Seth Duval. You can tell he works incredibly hard and he's also very friendly and willing to help out. It's always hard to find good service advisors who aren't trying to nickel and dime you at every step of the way. No pressure service and two thumbs up!

Unfortunately had a rough experience recently. I scheduled an appointment for a basic oil change, was told by the scheduler that it would be 45min at the most and they'd have me out of there. Scheduled with Andrea but was initially met by Chu. Addressed my concerns with the car, because the last time I was here they said I really needed a power steering flush. I told him at the end if we could talk about the basic inspection they do, let me know about the things I needed again and quote me a price so I can get my finances situated. It was hardly busy, for a good while I was the only person in the waiting area, after over an hour of waiting Andrea (not the person I spoke with) handed me the keys and told me I was all done. I had to once again bring up concerns and just felt I was rushed out and because she wasn't the person I spoke with initially she really didn't know what was going on. She just handed me the paperwork, didn't go over any of it just said that I needed a new rear wiper blade and air filters...so what bout that flush you guys said I needed in the past? As I was sitting in my car trying to read through everything and seeing "Fail, fail, fail" statuses everywhere on things she didn't bring up. Not to mention the car wash was down and they didn't have a solve, maybe taking it somewhere close by? I mean you are paying more for dealership quality. And they left the car tag, plastic sheets on the seats and paper flooring all in my car, no one bothered to check it's just in and out here with little care. It was an unfortunate mess and I won't be returning here for my car maintenance needs.

I used to frequent this place because it was close to my work but the quality of the food went downhill fast. It's essentially false advertising when customers are paying for something they read on the menu and not getting that. You're charging people extra for better quality and jipping them with the final product, it's a plain and simple rip-off. I'm not sure if they changed management or cooks but there are definitely items that are not consistent with the taste, quality, and ingredients they used to have. About a month ago I posted pictures on here of the food and wrote to them through their website contact form where they even urge customers to voice their concerns and I never heard back...so I've never been back. The two stars is simply for the friendly wait-staff.

Cute little shop with surprisingly delicious cupcakes! I definitely don't venture around Western Ave., some shops just look closed all the time or ghetto looking but have been wanting to try this place since I spotted it across from Zamoras and saw all the great reviews. A look at their website cupcake menu will have you drooling. Stopped in on during a date and picked up four different flavors and all were extremely delicious! You really can't go wrong with any choice and I want to try them all. I'm usually not a frosting fan, normally places make it where it hardens or is waaaay too sweet and fake tasting but they did a fantastic job with all their toppings, creamy flavorful and the cake was so soft! I would definitely recommend to anyone.

The food is really really good. The price not so much. Pretty much plan on spending about $10 per person here (give or take). If the price was better I'd give this place a full 5 stars because the food actually tastes fresh. Fries were crispy, their sauce they use is pink (which I thought weird)  but it's the best I've tasted and the Pita bread is nice and fluffy soft.  I'd definitely come back to splurge.

Great little Mexican place that I had been wanting to try because of all the great reviews, the thing that brought me in finally is I ended up really loving one of their salsas they entered in a contest during the Old Avondale Fiesta. It was settled...we had to try this place the very next day. Food was good, they have a lot of variety, salsa bar, lots of yummy drinks to choose from, clean facility, and the staff was super friendly.   I just wish you could get more chips with your meal and there was nothing on the menu about buying extra on the side.  Finally the only reason I deducted a star was the whole reason I came here in the first place, because I loved the salsa! They only give you one extra small container with your chips and that's it. I was more than happy to buy some more and take it to-go but unfortunately was told that once they put it in the little containers they have no way of selling it to me and I would have to wait 3days for them to make it again and hopefully catch them before they put it in the containers, then I would be able to buy it. Bummer!! It's so hard finding good salsa and you're telling me there is no way to sell it to me?! I don't care if you have to give me a ton of little containers, was really looking forward to taking some home :(

Unfortunately got food poisoning from either the egg soup or sesame chicken. I can't even visualize their food with out feeling the urge to puke. We won't be returning anymore :/

The staff here have no respect for the customer.  Super pushy when I had to tell the girl twice that I just wanted to refill my tea and I didn't want to by anything else, then 4 TIMES I kept having to tell her the amount I wanted to spend, and she went over in price each time, I should have just said nevermind at that point and left.  They will try and squeeze every ounce out of you and play it off like it's no big deal. When those little ounces add up fast it is a big deal and it's clear they have no respect for your money either.  I don't care how good a product is, if it is followed by inconsiderate customer service that's a huge turn off and I will not be returning.

I was hesitant to shell out $8 for just a sandwich after all the low reviews but it beat having ramen noodles for lunch. I went with the Mac & Rib and to be honest the first couple bites weren't mind blowing and the sandwich itself is nothing to look at but the deeper you got the more delicious it became. The flavors weren't crazy just basics that were blended well and made for a good sandwich. I love bbq so the pulled pork was my fave, they give you a decent amount and it wasn't too sweet either. Overall food was yummy and hit the spot, staff was friendly but I think $6-7 for just the sandwich by itself would have been more adequate but really no qualms.

Clean, never a line at this location, ya it's expensive...if you get the regular sized burger and fries...here's a tip, I just started ordering the "little" version. The burger is no happy meal sized burger, it's bigger than most regular fast food chain burgers, I can't imagine what the normal size would be like. And you know they always dump more fries in your bag than the cups can hold so it's like getting a larger portion for a lot less! Trust me, just try it one day, and you'll see you get plenty full.  Only thing I could possibly dislike is how instantly greasy the bag they give you gets because they throw all the fries in it. May ask them to double bag or something, hate taking it back to work and it leaving grease spots on my car seat or at my work desk wherever I set it down.

I wouldn't recommend this place, especially for beginner sushi-eaters. I've been to many a sushi house and the selection here is quite limited, they also don't have descriptions on most of the items, not even a side paper or menu to request. The staff were so sweet though and we didn't want to be rude and just leave so we each had a roll of sushi and holy cow! ..even the Cali rolls were expensive.  You can tell when you walk in by the decor and menu that this place definitely had the "trying too hard" vibe.  The two stars were purely for the sweet asian lady who took the time to tell us and show us why their green tea was unique and had a burnt popcorn aftertaste.

Perfect balayage done by Sarah. Quiet but sweet and she blended my hair better than I've ever had ombrés or highlights done by anyone else in the past. I was just confused when the receptionist told me a balayage/full highlights range from $80-$130 depending on hair length and if more time and bleach is required. I have short hair (to the top of my shoulders) and the processing time took 15 minutes then toning and wash, nothing extensive or extra, so I definitely thought I'd be in the lower end. It ended up being $150 and I wasn't sure why, was she a master stylist or something? Not that her work wasn't flawless but the estimated range from the recep was way off. Just be prepared. A little worried to return only because of how expensive it is or could be for my short hair (and I'm bummed I forgot to use my first timer check-in from Yelp, damn!)

The wait staff is incredibly attentive and professional.  A little pricey but the food quality/customer service is well worth it. My family was treated very well and that always makes me a happy customer.

So happy I was able to get an appointment with Layne, she's a busy lady but she's worth the wait to book with. She gave me a proper consultation regarding my brows because I really wanted something that would not only look amazing but work well with my face shape.  Usually after waxings I'm constantly looking in the mirror after and find all the things I need to fix or still hiding them with my bangs, but not with Layne! I left feeling so excited that she was confident in getting my brows where I wanted them to be. She took her time and I felt totally comfortable talking to her and addressing my concerns.  Now I'm brushing my bangs aside to show these beauties off, I can't stop looking at them, in a good way!
