I needed passport photos quick and initially went to Walgreens first to get pictures taken. The pictures taken at Walgreens came out horrible and made my skin look discolored and shiny.  I found Williams Passport Photos on Yelp and was able to make an appointment the next day. Mr. Williams was very kind and knowledgable about the photos I needed. Overall it took less than 20 minutes and the pictures came out great. For $22 I feel like I got a fair deal and am very satisfied with my photos.

I went to this store in order to have some of my pictures restored and unfortunately came across an employee named Dolores in the photo department. This is by far the worst display of customer service that I have experienced with Walgreens or any other store I have ever visited. I was using the self-service computer and had asked her what I needed to do next in order to progress with my order. She started by telling me that I needed to scan the pictures and rudely kept pointing to the machine as if I was somehow supposed to know exactly where the scanner was hidden. I asked her to show me instead of just pointing and she just kept repeating "there, there". I then realized that there was a drawer underneath the computer and opened it to scan the pictures. She then condescendingly stated "there you go" and advised me that I obviously had to scan the pictures in order to get them into the computer. After I scanned the pictures she then stood next to me and started rudely telling me how to operate the machine by saying "do this and do that" without explaining anything or making sure it was the way I wanted it. During this, there was another customer asking her to show her where an item was located and had asked Dolores to get it for her as she seemed to have an issue that made it hard for her to get around. I was amazed how Dolores told her that she would not get it for her and told that it was only a arms reach away and that the customer could easily get it herself. After this customer asked again and Dolores would not do it, I took it upon myself to get the item for the customer. Dolores came back to my machine and just started hitting buttons as if to quickly finish my order and rush me out of the store. I then advised her that I no longer wanted her help and eventually was able to get the order correctly into the machine myself. After I complained to her manager Dolores told me that I didnt need to get upset about it and began telling me how the previous customer had been in the store for multiple hours and was just trying to be a nuisance, I told her that there was no excuse for treating someone the way she did. She than told me that I didnt know what she was going through or what kind of life she had as if to argue with me further. I advised her that this was none of my business and that no matter what; the customer should always come first. Dolores than told me that she always treats every customer the same and would not be changing her ways anytime soon. She also stated that she had been there for a long time and no matter what, she would be there for a long time to come. I told her that I was amazed that Walgreens would keep someone for so long if that is how she treated all of her customers and asked for my claim check so I could leave. She proceeded to continue as if she had not heard me and after 5 minutes of this she finally gave me my claim check. I will never go to this walgreens again.

I've given this place too many chances because it's conveniently located close to my house, but the location is the only positive factor for this store. The employees here apparently hate their jobs showing from their annoyed faces right as you walk in. No hello, no smile just a glare. God forbid you ask a question about how to operate their equipment. Attempting to scan a photo became too much of a burden for the blonde at the front and I was brushed off with, "try it yourself." She kept giving me quick excuses and had no real intention of trying to assist me. She alone made an easy choice to never come back here again. Consider yourself warned.

A friend and I wanted to celebrate here for his birthday, unfortunately he didn't receive the yearly bday coupon in his email. I've had great pass experiences with Grimaldis being very accommodating and decided to call and ask the manager if he could do anything for us. The manager, Don told us there was nothing he could do and that my friend had to register again for the bday coupon. I don't understand how people with horrible customer service become managers. Won't be visiting this Grimaldis again.

Half an almond  I haven't found any convenient salad joins in the Phoenix area so I was interested in trying this one out. Ordered the grilled marinated chicken salad ($9.75)to go. Noticed when I got home that the toppings were completely lacking. The croutons and nuts were nonexistent. I seriously found half an almond and no croutons!! I mean I went digging for those almonds and nada. I ordered feta cheese and they decided I'd rather have a sliver of parmesan instead. The container was all spinach with four strips of chicken. For God's sake people the toppings especially the cheese and nuts are the best part of any salad. Now because of my stupid, healthy decision to try this place I'm left still starving with a measly $10 box of spinach.

Came here for happy hour and trivia night. The happy hour goes from 4-7pm and all day Sunday. Splurged on cheesy bread, zucchini fries and BAKED BRIE OHHH MY GOD! So good! Trivia was definitely challenging .. This could have been due to the amount of drinks I consumed. Soo invite some intelligent people to be on your team! Atmosphere is low key and good lighting for unattractive people (myself not included)

This place is intimate and exclusive (open two days a week and limited hours) and has a speakeasy atmosphere. Walking in I honestly felt like I was somewhere exciting and foreign. They rotate the theme, menu and decor every few months. Most of the decor used is for sale as well. I mean how freaking creative is that!? The menu book was so beautiful and unique I actually considered stealing it.   I came during the Shanghai Social club concept and had the Sippin tea in the LBC and Stewed. The BEST cocktails I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The mixologists are incredible at what they do and you can tell how much they enjoy it.   The menu is a little overwhelming because everything sounds lovely and somewhat exotic. I asked our bartender for suggestions and was hooked first sip. Truthfully, I would have probably loved everything here, but I'll be back for the next theme! All of them from here on out.

I love the cozy, casual atmosphere at Craft 64. It's on Main and next door to The House Brasserie ***ADORE that place!*** Craft 64 has that fun Scottsdale restaurant/ bar vibe without being too packed and hectic on a Friday night. The staff was really welcoming and our server Cara gave us great service and recommendations.   We came during happy hour which had a decent selection. Tried the charcuterie board. It was just "okay". I think overall it was lacking and not worth $8. Definitely not enough bread. It needed something sweet like a jam spread and the olive oil alone was not enough.. Add some vinegar to that b!   The Fico pizza caught our eye. (If you have ever been to Federal Pizza in Phoenix, they have a Casanova pizza, which is similar in ingredients to the Fico. I absolutely love the Casanova and decided to test the Fico out and compare the two.) The Fico is very sweet so adding something salty like bacon is definitely recommended. Even with the added bacon it was still too sweet for my liking. It needs something bitter to compliment the sweetness of the fig. So Federal's Casanova still wins my heart.   There's plenty more menu exploring to be done here. I will be back to try the signature mules and their broad selection of beers.

I used to come here when this place was called Lobbys so it's been a few years. Well the burgers and dogs are still delicious if not better! The chili cheese fries are the best around. The cook is super nice and brought stuff we needed to our table without us having to ask. Great job Johnny, we'll be back!

The Local Donut is hidden in between a rundown shopping plaza on the east side of Hayden road. It used to be another donut shop that only lasted a few months. It's not the best location and hopefully they get some eye-catching advertising otherwise you'll drive past this place.   The bacon maple and strawberry cheesecake donut certainly did not lack in taste. They were soft and fresh and the bacon was delicious with a nice crunch. The traditional donuts were better than chains like Bosa and Dunkin. There wasn't a huge variety early in the morning and I didn't see any cronuts which I really wanted to try. I'll be back for those babies.   Some reviewers are proclaiming these donuts are comparable if not better than other shops around the world.. Umm no. I have to respectfully disagree. Don't get me wrong these are some scrumptious donuts, but I don't believe they even come close to my favorite spots on the west coast or the mind blowing donuts I've experienced in Chicago and NYC.   This place is definitely worth a taste and one of the better donuts shops in the Scottsdale area.
