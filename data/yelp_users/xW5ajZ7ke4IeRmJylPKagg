this is truly a mom and pop chinese restaurant (the mom is the waitress/bus girl/hostess and the pop is the cook)  a ton of the local chinese folks eat here and i thought it would be my duty to let the rest of the world in on a well kept secret.  if i've eaten here 20 times, i've seen someone from the chinese community here 15 times.  some of the best chinese restaurants gain there claim to fame from word of mouth and sadly  not on yelp  the food is authentic "toi-son" style southern hillbilly food.  same stuff my grandma would make:  1) foo-guah guy (bitter melon w/chicken) 2) lin-ngah gong (lilly root soup) 3) hom-yee guy-lup chow-fon (salty fish with chicken fried rice) 4) muy-toy kow-yoke (fatty pork with preserved vegetables)   if it's your 1st time trying out the place try from the above list or:  1) beef chow fun 2) peking pork chops 3) green beans with preserved vegetables 4) steam chicken with ginger/garlic sauce 5) fried chicken wings 6) filet fish with chinese broccoli 7) walnut shrimp 8) tomato beef chow mein with pan fried noodles  caveat:  the decor is cheezy, the bathrooms are sleazy, but the prices are easy  again, get over the decor and eat some of the best home-style chinese cooking :)

To start off, this place is actually called "New Hong Kong" restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-hong-kong-phoenix  It was originally called Hong Kong Restaurant from the 1950's and they kept the 60 year old sign in the parking lot (kinda nostalgic).  If you look at the sign on the building, it says New Hong Kong (kind of confusing when you Yelp it)  If you ask any of the old school chinese who have lived in central phoenix for the past 50 years where to get authentic home style cooking, they know it's at NHK.  If you ask the buffet community where to eat, this place is probably not on the top 100 (disclaimer:  I've never eaten the lunch buffet)  Sadly, it seems that the old school chinese community that patronize this place don't give it the Yelp reviews that it deserves, hence the low ratings.  If you're looking for traditional Cantonese style food, here's a list of semi-authentic stuff I recommend:  1) Beef chow fun 2) Tomato beef over Hong Kong style noodles 3) Fish filet over Gai Lon (Chinese broccoli) 4) Salt/pepper chicken wings (not on the menu) 5) Peking pork chops 6) West lake beef soup 7) X.O. green beans  If you want to go hard core Toi-sahn hillbilly style home cooking like poh-poh and ngain-ngain used to make:  1) Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice) 2) Foo-guah guy, Ow-see (Bitter melon chicken with black been sauce) 3) Gee-ngoke-beng (Steamed pork with preserved salty fish) 4) Hoh-yeow gai-lon (Steamed chinese brocolli with oyster sauce) 5) Bok-jom-guy (Boiled chicken with garlic and ginger sauce) 6) Muy-choi-kow-yuk (Fatty pork hot-pot with preserved vegetable) 7) Bok choy with black mushroom  Occasionally, they will bring out the compimentary house special Doang-guah gong (winter melon) or linh-gnaw gong (some sort of chinese turnip) soup.  This place is a well kept secret, spread the wealth I tell ya.

seriously, how hard is it to make a decent fast food teryaki chicken bowl? and marble sized shumai?  what in the world?  if you're totally destitute and you can't find any other restaurant to spend your last dime on, then go ahead, you have been forewarned.  how do they stay in business is my question

the restaurant formerly known as the best hong kong.  what happened to this place?  this used to be our go-to chinese restaurant in the east valley!  the food has gone down hill and the service which used to be 3/5 has gone to 1/5.  there was this young college age kid/busboy/waiter (who knows, he could have been older, just add 10 years to what you think they are) who actually chased us out the door and demanded that we leave 15% tip when we only left 10%....what a dufus  hello, we're trying to send you a message idiot.  i guess the best message is to not eat there and tell 100 other people to do the same  you shall be called "Worst Hong Kong"

chaaayp!  this place is a well kept secret.  we ordered the pho and bun.  as good as anyplace we've eaten and the prices range from $2.00 (for the  banh mi) and $4.75 for a decent sized bowl of pho.  the place is a nice little dive with courteous and cordial staff.  on a saturday afternoon the place was steadily busy.  great find.

i remember visiting this hotel when i was kid in the early 70's after dove hunting in maricopa with my dad and uncles.  i was amazed that there was a bat shaped pool with a ball shaped jacuzzi.  way cool.  i must take my daughter there to see it (again for me) someday.  i will have to revisit and give my review  i'm giving it 4 stars from my childhood memory of the pool

2 things that do not go well together: 1) mexican food 2) high prices. With hundreds of Mexican restaurants to choose from, we were lured in with a coupon and Wednesday "family" night.  Sure kid gets 4 corn dogs the size of your thumb for $1.50 and the wife and I split a $13 chimichanga + $2 upcharge for splitting (we were stuffed from the bottomless chip and salsa bowl)  now i gotta throw down a few prunes just to keep the pipes clean (and smooth, if you get my drift)  fool me once.....  on a side note, the whole Anderson Springs shopping center is packed to the gills on a wednesday night.  amazing

my brother and i did a drop in on a wednesday night in june.  the place was nearly packed (with asians) and people kept streaming in during the 1.5 hrs of eating some of the tastiest pho.  how many places in AZ can boast those kind of numbers?  if you go there, ask for Lauren or her sister  (daughter of the owners).  the other waitresses are all really friendly but don't usually speak as much english and usually will refer you to one of the sisters anyways.  our 1st time there, Lauren stood at our table what seemed like 20 mins pleasantly and patiently describing all the dishes we were curious about.  she wasn't looking over our shoulder at other customers and she seemed to enjoy talking to us.  we've eaten at the old place next to Lee Lee, cyclo and this place is as good if not better and the service is exemplary of what a great dining experience should be.  i reserve 5 stars for restaurants in heaven, so this one gets 4.96 stars

i was on this burrito quest last week. every day after painting i would stop by a different mexican food dive and try a burrito.  this is definitely one of the top states for mexican food (IMHO).  i remember seeing these "berto" burrito places popping up in phx (roberto's knock-offs) from san diego.  if you want a $4-out-the-door burrito the size of a tennis ball can, all meat and no rip-off filler (beans, rice, lettuce) then this is your place.  in a vain attempt to stave off my trigliceride killjoys, i ordered a chicken burrito.  when the server handed it to me out the take-out window the bag nearly ripped under the 2 lb. load (this was 1 burrito mind you)  as i commandeered my nissan frontier while simultaneously shifting, steering, signaling, pouring red and green hot sauce on the opening of the tree stump sized burrito and attempting to masticate the tender juicy shreds of fowl...alas, i was only able to consume 3/4 of the monster.  a feat that i could easily have done had i gone to any other burrito barn.  if you're a cheap-chinese like me and my wife, you can easily give her a 1/3 and you get 2/3 and be 90% satisfied (just go home and eat a peanut butter sandwich) and you're good to go.  way worth it  dew it

hilarious! where did the screaming yellow  "....we reserve the right to add 15% gratuity to your bill....." signs go?  aka we know the service and dimsum sux, so we'll try and make money another way.  best dimsum in phoenix (pretty low standards for a desert community i guess)  luckily there's plenty of competition now in the east valley (hint: go 1 mi east, 1 mile  south) NW corner, get there before 11am on weekends or stand in line with the rest of the other asians.

again, if it sounds too good to be true, (all you can eat sushi) then it's probably too good to be true (AYCE sushi).  so some of you are probably saying, "....he just ate at another AYCE sushi place and was so disappointed, fool you once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me".  we've been living in chandler for 3.5 yrs and we've never even heard of this place.  lesson learned:  never eat at a sushi place that doesn't come with high recommendations from people you have eaten with and trust their palates.  there's a semi-rational reason that other places charge $8-$13 a roll.  if they charge you that much and the sushi is sucky, then you would be the one making a scene at the cash register.  what's the deal w/japanese food being inherently expensive?  they sell us great cars and really do it to us on the food.  show me a japanese restaurant where you can get out the door for less than $15/head and i'll show you kyoto bowl (see review)  for half the price, you can get twice as much food at an authentic chinese restaurant and have a ton of leftovers.  but i guess you can't get chinese cooks to cook it in front of you while catching shrimp in their hats.  go figure  i was amazed that when we went there on a friday night, the place was standing room only (but we were the only people of asian persuasian)    .  i get the impression that the staff is trying to save money (more tips for the 2 waitresses?) because they seemed to be falling all over each other like keystone cops, wizzing past our tables and avoiding eye contact whenever we needed an extra pair of chopstix, napkins or water refills.  am i being the the overly cautious 1st time parent or what?  the waitress brings out the scalding hot soup and passes it right over the head of our 1 y/o daughter sitting in her high chair and plops it down within arms reach of her.  we quickly move it to the adult who ordered it (brilliant).  we were sitting with my friend's 20 or so family members and requested a separate check to ease the confusion.  she stuttered and stammered and said that she was not allowed to do that and that we would have to be on the same check (i guess we had to sit at a separate table to get a separate tab?)  i could see how 18 on 1 tab and 2 on another would be confusing.  my wife ordered the tempura soba noodle soup and said that it was so salty that her tongue is now preserved for life.  i ordered the chicken katsu which was decent, but the sauce was almost like biscuits and gravy style sauce.  if you're on a budget and just wanna stuff your face with low-grade sushi and walk away full, then this is the place.  if you want quality, great tasting sushi, then you'll have to pay the piper.  you have been forewarned

if you grew up on 1970's style mexican food, then this is your dream come true.  enchilada sauce the way its supposed to look and taste.  ditto on the green sauce.  tamales green or red are fresh.  they still call em "cheese crisps".  if you love baja fresh or rubios, then you're barkin up the wrong tree.

if $20 per person for all-you-can-eat sushi sounds too good to be true, then it's probably too good to be true.  the 1st red flag should have been AUCE sushi.  think about it, if you were the owner of the restaurant, would you put out 5 star sushi so that people can scarf it all down for $20?  i guess it's just as much my fault for believing a korean barbecue restaurant would have semi-spectacular sushi.  whatever you do, don't let the hostess convince you to sit in the little "black hole" room with the "sushi" sign on the doorway even if you're only going to order the AYCE sushi (which is a mistake in itself).  we were left in there for about 15mins to peruse(?) the menu.  we finally checked off a few rolls and were waiting for the waiter to come back and take our order sheet, all the while we could see the sushi chef standing there twiddling his thumbs secretly laughing that he was getting paid to do nothing.    i finally figured i could just take the slip of paper up to him myself, so i did.  he seemed a little taken aback, but took the paper reluctantly and pretended to start our order.  i say that because it seemed to take another 10 or so minutes for them to bring us the 1st role.  by then we were so famished, that we scarfed it down like a pack of rabid wolves.  it tasted ok, but i couldn't tell if it was because i was so grateful to have something to eat or if it really tasted great.  i've heard it said that they purposefully bring you a roll every 10-15 minutes so that you won't order more than you can eat (in which the rules state that any left over food will trump the AYCE price of $20 and they reserve the right to change the pricing structure to full price for each roll/nigiri that is not eaten)    fair enough, but anyone who's ever eaten at an AYCE joint, knows full well that if you eat too slow, you will invariably eat about 1/3 of what you would have eaten if you were allowed to eat at your own "natural" pace (haha).  so by the time we got  to the 3rd of 5 rolls, we ended up choking down the less than stellar 2 remaining rolls in fear of being charged the full price for the whole meal.  yeah, i must admit that it was not such a great idea to order "fillers" such as tempura, but the batter was like a batter that you would find on a beer battered onions rings at the local BBQ joint.  it was thick, doughy and tasteless.  i guess i'm used to thin, light and crispy tempura batter that i've had at other japanese restaurants.  if you plan on taking me there for the AYCE sushi and say that you'll pay for me, my wife and 1 y/o daughter, don't be offended if i decline. you'll thank me later b/c i'll have saved you a ton of money

I'm sad to hear that the 3rd reviewer has had such a bad experience with QAS but I'm going to have to give him (Gary) a stellar review.  I grew up in Tempe in the '60's and moved away and came about 7 yrs ago and have been scrambling to find a decent shop.  I tried Tony's Automotive on 56th and Thomas.  Tremendous service, quality work, and a price to match (ok, cheaper than a dealer I suppose?)      My brother-in-law, and 2 nephews have been going to Gary for years with no complaints, just bigger bank accounts.      When I 1st came to Gary, I was skeptical because of the "low overhead" decor of his facility.  And with all 1st time visits at a shop, I'm hoping for the best but preparing for the worse.      I, (coincidentally am Chinese), but I don't go to that church, and I don't speak a word of Chinese to save my life so it was a minor challenge to try and decipher what Gary and his wife were trying to convey.      To put things in perspective, I'm an above average (MHO) shade tree mechanic that has: 1) changed oi, 2)minor tune-ups, 3) brakes, 4) 4 cylinder valve jobs, 5) installed headers, 6) radiators, 7) fuel pumps, 8) clutches, 9) shocks, struts and blah blah blah      As I've gotten older, made a little more money, and have a wife and child that depend on reliable transportation, I've become dependent on others to do the work.       So, with my hands tied, (not literally), I handed him the keys to my ailing ride and said "have your way with her".    Here's a few of my observations/experiences using Gary's QAS:        1) He seemed to have a bunch of cars in his parking lot and on the rack, but he took the time to explain in his heavily accented english what was wrong with my car, what he changed, why he changed it and what the function was for said part.  He told me that he could have gone a more expensive route but that this was the best fix. (like the Jerry McGuire movie, he had me at the price)  The mechanics lesson was just a bonus.         I'd could bore you with all the different things he's fixed on my cars but I'm too lazy to walk away from the laptop and dig out the receipts.  But, prior to coming to Gary's, I usually would walk away from a shop with nothing less than $300 (like it was some sort of algebra equation y=$50x + $300)      Just for the fun of it, I should ask him what he'd charge for a fuel pump for my 1999 dodge caravan.  I took it to Tony's and it was, (are you sitting down clear of falling on sharp objects?) a blood draining $850!!      To date, I've never paid more than $275 for anything and the lowest was $75.  Maybe he's just nickel and diming me and getting the same amount per year as any other place but it feels like an free installment plan(?)  If you like those nice auto-salons with free coffee, massages and manicures, more power to ya.  If you like quality work at a reasonable price, go to Gary's QAS.  I'm happy as a lark and heavier in the pocketbook area (as Joey on Friends would say, "if you get my drift")

food was nothing to complain about but does mexican food have to cost more than $5?  if you enjoy paying $10-15 per person for beans, rice and tortillas, then you've found the right place.    we ate there at night and they seated us in a few adjacent booths where lights were burned out and we could hardly see who was sitting next to us.  we left a tip and some extra for the light bulbs.

go for the screamin lunch menu!  all the usual fare for $3.50 and up.  plus it's in a nice area and the decor is pleasant.  you can get the same stuff in a styrofoam bowl at those other places but why not eat it out of a bento box and look stylish at the same time?  not earth shattering but then again, it won't cost you and arm and a leg...

I used to live in Sacramento and would come home to visit family in Tempe.  At the time this was the only "chinese" restaurant (1990's).  My family would drag me here and I would be aghast at the small portions and steep prices (chow mein for $8-10?) and the portions were about 2/3rds the size of what I would get for $6.  Ignorance is bliss and when there's no competition, they can do this kind of stuff.  Thankfully, there about 10 chinese restaurants within a 5 mile radius of this place and no one I know even comes near this place.  So if it's high prices and diet-sized portions you're looking for, then have at it.  What cracks me up is that the top 5 restaurants (according to many of the local chinese) are either not even on yelp or have only a few reviews.  The best "yelpers" are the word-of-mouthers.  if it's good it spreads throughout the chinese community like wild fire.  And if it's bad, it spreads faster than a ladies sewing club....(i made that one up)  I would recommend these places if you want the real deal (in no particular order)  1) Asian Cafe Express 2) New Hong Kong 3) Tao Garden 4) Asian Hong Kong Diner 5) Great Wall 6) China King  just ask the locals who grew up here

think pei-wei but more of it!  i'm reluctant to pay for "fusion" but i was pleasantly surprised at the bang for the buck plus it tasted pretty good.  i don't venture too far off the menu but i can recommend:  1) the pad thai (sp?) 2) bourbon chicken  and i don't recommend the walnut shrimp (unless you like eating a whole jar of  mayonaise dumped onto shrimp)  perhaps it would be wise to ask them to leave the mayo on the side and you can add as much or as little as your gut can handle.  the service is friendly and the place is as clean as the starbucks next door.  what's cool is that they offer brown rice and i don't recall them charging extra for requesting it (take note other nickel-and-dime you to death restaurants)!  although i have to make a note of a time when we were there a half hour before closing.  the kitchen crew was soaping up the exhaust hoods and everything else while customers were still coming in to eat.  luckily (?) we already had our food at our table but who knows, mebbe we were eating tilex chicken too!  i guess that's the cons of having an open kitchen...the customers get to see the good, the bad and the ugly.

if you're clammering for dimsum, then you better run to your car after church and git there before 11 or you'll be working up an appetite while standing in the lobby being nudged aside by our stroller as we waltz on by with full stomachs!    seriously, kudos to the owners for finally putting some long needed competition against the "other" east valley dimslum joint that best of phoenix mag really needs to get a clue on.    they say that the best way to judge an ethnic restaurant is by taking a peek through the windows and see if there is a sea of people representing that ethnic group.  Look for the older generation especially, they've been there and done that and are looking to find the level of food that they're used to eating from the old country.    the service is commensurate to any dimsum restaurant, underpaid cart pushers trying to pay for ASU tuition so that they can find a better paying  job that allows them to eat dimsum v. serve it.    if it seems like the stuff is getting swiped off the carts by patrons whose tables are closer to the doors of the kitchen, you can always ask the waitresses that seem to be competing in the 100 meter dash to nab you some "from the back" if you know what you want.    my wife instinctively grabs the guy-geck (chicken feet), the ow-see-pai-gwut (steamed black bean pork ribs), the cheng-fun (for our 1 y/o daughter), the wu-tau-go (pan fried taro root), and the perennial favorites hock-gow (steam shrimp dumplings) and siu-mai (steam ground pork dumplings).  we're amazed that we don't have to use our out of jail free card when we present the $20 tax + tip bill to the cashier.  like the other reviewer said, we used to have to drive 40+ miles round trip and sit next to smokers (phx law used to allow it) to get decent dimsum and now we only have to drive 3 and we are free to give 15% gratuity v. being guilted into it with the glaring 8 1/2 x 11 sheets of bright yellow paper plastered all over the cash register counters :-)  i teach math, not english (obviously)

i'm a creature of habit.  if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  if you found a gem, stop looking for a replacement gem.  we're talking China King.  we thought we found mecca.  1 mile from home  decent prices  tastes great  standing room only with a lotta jet black haired people lined up  a happy place  our sunday morning after church go to  we had tried phoenix palace dim sum when it 1st opened (everything for $2.25, even the normally $3 and up stuff?)  how bad can it be?  we left the place saying, "what was that we just ate"  not bad, just not memorable  back to our happy place (china king)  then through the chinese-restaurant gossip vine, we hear that it's under new management and it's the place to be.  we reluctantly meet our family there with low expectations ready to go home afterwards to eat something else to take up the slack  much to our surprise, this place has changed.  the prices are comparable, the place is 95% full, and we were wondering where the standing room only crowd that we use to try and beat at 10:30 at china king were ending up at.  they're here.  with us.  from now on.  dare i try the place on the southwest corner of dobson and warner  no way jose  wild horses couldn't drag me there  the new happy place  you should try it  it will be your new happy place  it's late, i'll stop now

so we order 7 dishes  go ahead, take a guess what that adds up to before taxes?  WRONG!    can you say $15.75? divide that by 7 and you get $2.15 per  it's a flat rate (none of the multi-tiered pyramid ramp up pricing)  the stuff that we usually order that falls into the 2nd and 3rd tier pricing structure was all $2.15!  this is a sign of the times ladies and gentlemen  if you wanna pay more  and impress your inlaws and friends, go and eat at the other places

beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.  The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?  When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  "oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill"  I said forget it, keep it.  i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.    yeah, really worth losing a customer for?  my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.  gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)  $2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.  as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)  so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?  it's the chinese way i guess  back to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace.  will you forgive us? haha

this has been edited for the visually challenged.  haha yeah, todai in the biltmore was a bust.  they began the downhill slide when they gave out birthday "vouchers"......good for the NEXT visit.  little did they realize is that most people who came in to eat free on their birthdays usually brought in a boat load of friends, relatives and other full paying customers that would not have probably come in at all (lemme see, 1 free loader, and 10 full paying customers x $25 ea?) duh, lemme get a calculator (for you post ti-55 borners) too bad they fell asleep in that boring marketing 101 class eh?  back to PSFB, not a bad place to go on a weekday and get all you can eat sushi for about $10.  yeah, it ain't RA, sakana or beni but it will suffice.    we like the fact that you can have a party of like 20 family and friends and there's no haggling over what to order, glaring at the late comers, or having to eat someone elses "favorite" dish.  (i hope my family doesn't read this).    back in the day, we used to have to drive 400 mi to todai in LA, then 15 mi to the biltmore, and now all we have to do is walk a mile to NW corner of elliot and AZ av. to what used to be the long time iconic eatery, bill johnsons.    i miss the sawdust floors but i soon forget as i'm eating my 24th piece of sushi, 8th rack of korean short ribs and 4th bowl of green tea ice cream.  and as i recall the only thing i learned in econ 101, there is the much welcomed east valley competition just 2 miles west and 1 mile south (hint: it's on the NE corner sharing a parking lot with MCD's, lee lee, and caddy-corner to that dimslum place)  ok kinda sewer

having grown up eating chinese food and mexican, i feel pretty comfortable going into a new restaurant and ordering certain dishes without much fear and trepidation.  but throw me into a middle eastern cuisine and i'll end up ordering something stupid.  that's why we like going to AYCE when it comes to indian, afghan, middle eastern or mediterannean.  You can try a number of things that you would not have a clue about if you were to order straight off the menu and you can go back for the stuff you like.  i have no clue what we ate, what it was called and couldn't even recognize it again at another restaurant.  but it did taste good (but we don't really know what to compare it to).  like the 1st poster said, the ground beef kabob was so heavy in spice and rich, i nearly tossed my cookies after eating a 2nd helping.  it tasted good in the beginning but by the 8th or 9th piece, i was ready to kiss the porcelain cadillac.  that's what i get for being greedy i suppose.  the chicken breast kabob had a great sauce, but it was dry (as stated by the 1st poster)  For $10/person and lunch, it's a great way to taste different things on the menu w/o having to order 20 items and filing chapter 11 afterwards.  1 thing we noticed is that a ton of people were coming in on Good Friday that seemed to be of the middle eastern persuasian (sometimes a good indicator that the ethnic food is semi-authentic?)  we'll probably return once a year to get our afghan fix  the owner was very nice and talkative, great service

if ninja is the suckiest place to eat japanese, then kabuki is the welcomed breath of fresh air that i needed.  usually when you go to the new fancy shmancy over-the-top decor restaurants the food is lacking.  much to my surprise, this place was decent.  we ordered sushi and entrees (i forgot to take pix) and it was really decent tasting semi-fusion-ish japanese food.  a bit on the pricey side but at least it tasted pretty good.  where ninja's keystone cop waitresses lacked, kabuki waitresses did very well.  they were appropriately attentive, nice, but not hovering or annoying.  we had the 5'10'' former WNBA waitress who was pleasant and cordial.  i know that the tempe mktplace is taking a lotta hits on how crappy it is but i was pleasantly surprised at the outdoor mall area.  there's this cool conversation pit by a gas fireplace in front of barnes and noble.  very family friendly and hopping on a friday nite.  my 15 m/o daughter was mesmerized by the water fountains and dancing water displays.    8 months of the year this place would be a great place to walk and hang out.  i hope it doesn't become a 1 hit wonder and fall to the way of the other malls of the past.

Can you say Chaaayyp dim-sum in one sentence?  I suspect that this is lost leader pricing ($2.18) per dish.  Like all the start-up competitors to grace the east valley, they lure you in with outrageously low prices.  You get used to not looking at your bill and they all of a sudden raise the price, tack on a surcharge for tea or what not and you only notice it when you either give them your credit card or when you get home.  Crossing my fingers that this is not the case.  Or just enjoy the chaaayp ride when you can I suppose.  I wouldn't say that this is the BEST dim sum I've ever had but it's not the worse either.  Everything seems to be up to par except the chicken feet and cheng-fun (don't know the english equivalent, sorry).  I guess I prefer my chicken feet and cheng-fun to be on the softer side.  Perhaps they could steam the chicken feet and or cheng-fun for a few more minutes to eliminate the "rubbery-ness"(?)  I know what your thinking, "ok smarty, go home and make it yourself and see how hard it is..."  We took some friends from Canada here because they told us that they pay upwards of $4.50/dish in Calgary, Alberta.  That's gotta suck.  That's more than we pay for a gallon of gas (knock on wood)  After we waste the $3.50 per gallon in gas over the 14 mile round trip from north chandler, the discount is pretty much awash, so we just eat at China King (2-mile round trip, 36 cents in gas).  What can I say, I'm asian, we like to do the math.  I'd definitely hit this again if I'm anywhere w/in a mile of the hood.  My wife loves to shop the Mekong market, and my kid loves to climb on the merry-go-round afterwards.  She's even gotten several free rides from other patrons who put there kids on it and are gracious enough to let our daughter ride along.  What were we talking about?  Oh yeah, dim-sum  Try it, your bank account will love you.

BLECH!  Let me start off by saying that my dad is the king of horrifying cliches.  Strangely enough, they've actually become a vital part of my vocabulary and somewhat useful.  1) If it sounds too good to be true, then it's probably too good to be true  $2.18 per dish for dim-sum?  2) you get what you pay for I was telling a buddy of mine that the price trumps the food AND the service.  After being away from the place for a month I forget how yucky the food is and the service is deplorable.   3) fool me once, shame on you.  fool me twice (4 times?) shame on me and i deserve to be ripped off the 3rd and 4th times.  We were there on Sunday at 11am and my wife remembered that the carts come out from the kitchen and go around counter-clockwise.  Her theory is that by the time they get to the north side tables, all the food will have been picked at and decimated.   She insists that we be seated as far from the main entrance (north side) as possible.  We get a table right up against the back wall closest to the kitchen.  We're sitting there for about 10 mins and no carts even pass by.   I'm like thinking, "ok, dim sum is not really a fast food environment.  You stayed up way too late Saturday night and you stumble in for brunch.  It's supposed to be a slow, no rush, drink tea and have vibrant conversation with those around you." It was then that I started doing the math (not because I'm Asian.  I know what you were thinking).  I counted about 40 tables with 30 of them occupied.  I looked around to see what the MO of this place is.  A) there are only 2 carts being pushed around at any time (are they trying to lower overhead costs by owning only 2 carts?)  Instead of having several carts with the same items going different directions, it appeared that the cart pusher would only go back and fill her cart when it was empty.  So instead of just exchanging her empty cart for a "pre-loaded" cart, she actually disappears for about 3-5 minutes (and I presume she's in the kitchen loading her cart?)  B) since we had no food, I had time to count how many employees were on the floor and what their jobs seemed to be.  2 cart pushers, 3 bus boys (their job seemed to be water fillers, table clearers, and check retrievers) Fine, we all know that you can't seat people if there are no clean tables.  Then I counted 3 more (waiters?) with red vests going to tables and doing I don't know what (taking special orders?).    There was a man and woman that I assumed were the floor managers or owners that would be walking around doing "managerial" things like looking busy, answering questions, telling others what to do etc.  All the while I'm thinking "more cart pushers (the food is kinda important here) and less whatever the other 8 people were assigned to do.  The 1 hostess/cashier was trying to seat people, take numbers, and take peoples money.  I felt somewhat sympathetic towards her because I overheard a customer say "you gave us number 22" and just seated another party when you called out "22".  She apparently gave two patrons the same number.  She quickly apologized to customer "22b" and out of frustration handed him a slip of paper with the number "32".  Needless to say, the customer was not at all pleased with the exchange and hotly protested "uh, I don't think we want to go 10 places to the back of the line!!"  It was getting really ugly and awkward but one of the other employees came to the rescue by immediately seating "22b" and things were restored to semi-chaos.  Oh, did I mention the food?  When the 1st cart came by our table, the pusher stopped by the table next to us and was fumbling with the little metal dishes and trying to cut the cheng-fun.  She seemed a little shaky and not at all concerned with serving the customers swiftly.  While she was trying to serve the other table, her cart was blocking the aisle and the other cart pusher had to stand there and wait until she was done. When the cart finally came to our table, we were so famished and anxious that we just started grabbing this and that in fear of never seeing the cart again.  We grabbed the following dishes: 1) shrimp cheng-fun:  Rubbery and kinda bland 2) chicken feet:  Great sauce, but the chicken was not tender and again....rubbery (perhaps leave it in the steamer longer?)  Funny thing is, we've ordered the same 2 dishes the past 3 times and it's the same....RUBBERY!   I guess you could say it's our fault for falling for the same rubber chicken trick each time. 3) Har-gow:  standard steamed pork dumplings, tasted pretty good (or was I just starving and grateful for anything that touched my chopsticks?) haha 4) Wu-tao-gock:  Fried taro was decent 5) Foo-jook-gien:  steamed pork with black fungus wrapped in bean curd skins.  was probably the best thing that touched our palates.  I know what your saying, why do you keep eating the dim-sum if the quality is mediocre at best and the service is non-existent?  PRICE!  it's like a mosquito drawn into a bug zapper.

After reading the 1 star reviews, I was reminded of the last time I ate here (2yrs ago).  The place was rediculously crowded, the wait staff was running around like it was their 1st time working at a restaurant, they had what looked like 5th-9th grade girls (owners daughters?) serving drinks and seating people.  ".....hey, let's open up a restaurant, how hard can it be?  it's not rocket science...."  There were several 10-seat tables with lazy-susan's (sorry if your name is susan) that were reserved while throngs of customers waitied for the 4-person booths and smaller tables to open up.  Meanwhile, there were 3-4 tables waiting to be cleared as the waitresses looked like they were swamped.  Bringing out 1 order what looked like every 10mins.  we reluctantly conceded to taking a booth and 2 small tables for our family of 15 all the while eyeing the 10-seat banquet style tables with hand written scraps of paper shouting "reserved"  it took forever for them to come and take our order.  the waitress was making us nervous with her fast talking and sense of urgency to get back to serving food to the other tables.  so to make it easy, we just ordered double-portions of about 10 different dishes and we never saw her again until our 1st entree came out.  the whole dinner took in excess of 2 hrs   i remember saying that there are plenty of other places to eat with the same quantity, quality and price and much closer to east chandler where we live.  fast forward to august 27th, 2010....I entered this place again with fear and trepidation.  so i thought of a new strategy, have my wife who speaks fluent cantonese call in a reservation for 10 and we'll get the royal treatment.  as i listened to the jiberish dialogue, and my wife promptly hangs up the phone, i asked, "she didn't even ask for a reservation name or phone number?"  wife:  NO  greaaaat.  it was not an official reservation i shouted!  we'll get there, and the there will be no 10-seat banquet style lazy-susan equipped table available and the hostess will look at us and say, "what name was it under?"  so for the next 5 mile drive, i was thinking about what i was going to say when i arrived to our destination.  "....hi, were chinese and have a reservation for 10....."  "...reservation for 10, for the mayor of chandler.."  so when i swung open the door, the waitress/hostess greeted me with a "how many?" gesture (don't ask me what that's supposed to look like) and i held up both my hands with 8 fingers and 2 thumbs outstretched.  much to my surprise, she smiled and pointed to the 10-seat-lazy-susan.  for those of you who had a "bad service" experience, i have to let you in on a little secret:   this is going to sound racist, but if you don't speak the lingo, they're not gonna carry on a "hi, how are you, and how's your family" conversation.  I don't speak a lick of chinese and if i were to eat here alone, they'd snuff me.  since my dutiful wife is fluent, gregarious and has a lovely demeanor, they love her and chat her up.  they make recommendations, ask her how old her daughter is, how cute it is that she can speak cantonese too.  and i'm sure they're asking why doesn't your chinese-looking husband speak chinese?  is he one of those "slow" ones?  i having been raised for 3 generations in AZ, used to think, "these people really look down upon me for my ignorance"  but i've come to realize that perhaps they just feel more comfortable speaking to someone in their native language as opposed to the semi-complicated english(?)  in my 47 years of eating at 100's of different chinese restaurants, i can only count on 1 hand the few that have had great "western style" service. (think PFChang, pei-wei, panda express, noodle ranch).  does that make me stop eating at chinese restaurants?  if that were the case, then i would have to avoid eating at the top 10 chinese restaurants (as far as the food, price and quantity goes) in phoenix.  3 out of 4 i can live with.  good food, good quantity, bad prices, bad service.....i will go but only if someone insists on going  good food, bad quantity, bad prices, bad service (see wong's place)....if family members drag me there and are paying  bad food, good quantity, good prices, good service.....no way jose  you get the picture.  turns out there are as good places that are  1) closer in proximity 2) as good quality 3) same prices 4) same service (with wife or mom in tow)  so it's not a must have place to run to  if you live in chandler and awhatukee, you have my 4 stars

we love this place.  the beef buns are like giant siu-lung-bows that are sure to satisfy the meat lovers cravings.  Very friendly cordial staff.  If you're hankerin' for some northeastern chinese cuisine, you'll find no other in southeast valley.  Not dirt cheap but the food is fresh and of the highest quality.

This place is located in the back of the shopping strip away from the street view.  You'd never notice it unless someone tells you or you're cutting through the back of the strip.  The place is consistently busy even on weekdays.  The food is spicey but not 5 alarm hot like some mexican restaurants.

We ordered the Arizona and Mushroom burgers on whole wheat buns.  Awesome tasting and decent price.  The smash fries with olive oil, garlic and parsley were good also.   We went on a Friday night around 6:30pm during the busy dinner time.  I couldn't help but notice that the wait staff seemed a little out of sorts.  I could see a bunch of orders crowded on what looked like a 3' x 3' counter.    There was a man (manager?) standing there constantly looking down at something, looking up at this super hi-tech video screen, and re-arranging the food on the counter.  It seemed a little chaotic to reach for orders only to put them back again.  1st in 1st out?  Occasionally he would grab an order and hand it to someone and they would meander through the aisles looking a little confused while trying to spot the table numbers.  I watched for a while to see if one of the orders was ours.  I saw what looked like our order and it was just sitting there.  When the waitress (bless her heart) grabbed our order, she seemed to glance over our direction, only walk to the back of the restaurant and then come back to our table.  I realize that it's not McDonalds or In-and-Out burger, but it took like what seemed like 15-20 mins to get our food.  (2 burgers and a fry).  The wait staff was very friendly and  personable,  but it seemed really inefficient on how they organized and delivered the orders.  I would see a waiter walk by with just one or two items in his hands (a soda or shake) and then return with 2 more items.  I know in-and out calls out your name, but at least your food is somewhat together and on a tray(?)  I thought, eh, mebbe it was just a fluke that our order came out so slow, so I went to the counter to order some haystack onions rings and it took about 15mins for those to arrive at our table.  The whole meal took about an hour, which is no big deal if you're not in a hurry.  The vibe feels like semi-fast food (ie in-and-out) but then you end up sitting around like you're at Chili's or TGIFridays  The onion rings looked good on someone else's table, but ours seemed a little over cooked and at the bottom there were little shards (think shoestring potatoes in the aluminum can?) and not worth $2.29 in my opinion.  Give me those fat cut rings you get at some steak houses any day :)  If you don't mind paying $20 for 2 burgers, fries, rings and 60mins, then this is the place for you.   Just a suggestion if the manager is reading this.  Will try another location to see if this is the company protocol.  Perhaps they could use the old tried and true method of placing the duplicate receipt on the order with the table number?  I hope this place stays in business, the food is decent value and tastes great.  Might want to try a new algorithm for organizing and delivering the food(?)  just sayin

When you change jobs, you gotta find a new PCP and we all know what a hassle that can be.  Fortunately my wife recommended Dr. Tsai and his team.  The place looks like an IKEA display (ok, high overhead, but what can you do?). I was ready to hand my kid over to the person behind the counter and take a pager.  Dr. Tsai was 1 minute late seeing me and he hands me a starbucks gift card and apologizes profusely.  (yeah, I know, that never happens right?).  He asks me if I want a juice box, granola bar or a martini (JK).  My daughter loves going there for the juice box and snacks. Since when does a kid say "awwwww, you went to the dr. appt without me?  did you get a juice box and popcorn?"  He seems very knowledgeable, very calm, patient and doesn't seem like he's ready to sprint out the door.  He even said he'd spend an 1hr with me if necessary.  I actually felt strange like I was wasting his time! go figure.  he answered like 50 of my questions and the session ended after about 40mins because there was this award silence and we were both just looking around the room. (it's a guy thing, we don't like chit chat, just give me the skinny)  if you're on his provider list and live by san tan mall, you're lucky.  On another occasion, Holloween morning, I woke up with a burning pain in the joint just below my big toe.  I drop in at 8am just to see if I can see him and the receptionist says, no problem (What the?)  He was 10mins late (for a no appointment morning so hear me out on this)  He arrives wearing a captain america costume with shield and all.  He hands me another SB gift card, apologizes profusely and I give him the get outta jail free card because he's wearing a Capt. Amerca costume to work (I'm guessing he was late because he was at Walmart buying the shield?)  He takes a look at the red swollen joint and says, "..gout, arthritis, inflamation or injury..."  go get an xray and take these meds in mean time.  I tried all kinds of pain killers the night before to no avail.(ok Dr. math teacher) he gives me a script and the pain is semi-bearable so i can make it through the day at work.  I ended up riding my bike around the neighborhood with my kid trick-or-treating and felt like a dufus when I came up to people's houses. I'm sure they were thinking, this lazy @$$ father making her kid walk while he rides a bike.  Long story short(er), the pain and swelling is down to a 1/10 and the signs point to gout.  I don't know if it's just the meds keeping me pain free or what. (I'm not a doctor right?)  fingers crossed.  No more all you can eat fogo de chao!  sheeesh
