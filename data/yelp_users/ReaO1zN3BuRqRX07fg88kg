I have now been here twice and been very happy with the results.    My first visit I called to make an appointment because I was on a time schedule before leaving town the next day.  When I got there the place was packed and was told it would only be about 10 minutes of a wait.  It turned out to be a 40 min wait.  I normally would have left but I needed them done.  But I will say when it was my turn she (Suzie) did the fastest fill I have ever seen in my life and it was flawless.  I mean 20 minutes from start to finish and they looked great. I started off annoyed but I left happy and thats why I decided to come back.  My second visit I was a walk in at 5:15PM and only waited about 10 minutes.  I can't remember the guys name who did my nails but he did an awesome job on my full set.  He took his time and was very detailed and really friendly.    The only downfall of this place is the nail polish selection - it really isn't great.  I would recommend bringing your own.  I haven't checked out the gel selection - I think they have a lot more options.

I just love the Farm!! Such a beautiful place and scrumptious food options!!   I would have to say this is one of the best spots to bring people from out of town to see. This is a great spot for a girls brunch or event! Came here with a group of friends and found ourselves sitting and talking for hours! Just a relaxing goof vibe kind of place.   The restaurant in the very back is the best for breakfast/lunch!!  Great open patio! It's self serve on the beverages - teas, coffee, lemonade or water.   I have had the breakfast sandwich and the juevos rancheros and I cannot tell you which one was my favorite because they were both delicious in their own rights. Every menu option looks so good so its difficult to choose.   Serve is always friendly and attentive!

Hands down worst experience ever! Our waiter was just lost. We asked for our checks early to avoid having any issues but still took over 45 minutes. Then a manager got involved and was even more lost and rude about the whole situation, extremely unprofessional.

This place is really the worst car wash I have ever been to. First experience I pulled in and immediately some guy was trying to sell me to fix my new windshield and got so offended I told him no - escalated so much the manager ended up taking care of my wash because the guy was such a psycho.  Second experience - car detail... I'm so mad I paid $100 for a car wash- took them 8+hours to detail my truck and it didn't look any different. Third and last experience had to wait a century for my car to get washed when the entire time they are trying to sell me to buy the car wash packages.... I wouldn't even take them if they were free!!

Dr. George Carr is amazing! I have been coming to him for about 8 years now.  Beverly handles the front desk and is possibly the nicest person you will ever meet!  She remembers everyone! The dental hygienists are always professional, kind and informative.  They are engaging in conversation so its not you awkwardly sitting there while they clean your teeth.   Highly recommend if you are looking for a professional and awesome dentist.

I have no clue why it has taken me so long to come check this place out!  I had always heard great things - I love funky places (its totally underground - a cellar)! Awesome Happy Hour!!!   Came here for happy hour and sat at the bar by the time I left the place was packed and it was a Wednesday!   We started with the shrimp bread - this was not my choice order but I was happily surprised.  It was tasty!   Oysters were awesome! Fresh!  I like that you can order the amount you want and not get 1/2 dozen or a dozen. $1.5 for each.   Next we had the bucket of clams - This was different.  You get the steamed clams in a bucket and the broth and drawn butter in ramekins on the side... the clams had such great flavor and freshness they were great on their own.    I then tried the Manhattan Clam Chowder because not many places in Arizona actually make Manhattan.  I will say it was Ok - it tasted much more like a vegetable stew with a few clams.  I would stick to the traditional New England here.   Halibut ceviche - great flavor BUT the fish has been sitting in the citrus too long and was no longer firm - it became mushy.  Lime/Lemon cooks the fish if it sits too long the acid starts to break down the fish. The texture was off.  Like they had made the batch the night before or early that morning and it just got mushy :(  I would give this another go because the flavor mix was great.   Now something I didn't try - but the two ladies sitting next to us had ordered the escargot - They said it was absolutely delicious and baked to perfection.  I will take their word for it.  I have had a bad snail experience so I passed on this little dish :)   Even though two of the dishes were "okay" I still loved it and will be back to try more!  Definitely recommend if you are looking for some yummy seafood.

I am so bummed I didn't find this place sooner!! ITS THE BEST!!!  Definitely recommend calling to make an appointment though and more than 2 days in advance- smaller place and always busy  :) In my opinion is a good thing but also a downfall because I have tried to make appointments 2 separate times (2 days in advance and they are booked)  I had come here after a nail disaster from a larger nail shop just down the road and saw they had an awesome yelp page... - Tina was a gem!  Extremely friendly and fixed my awful nail job right up!   Tinas mom does the pedicures - and they have to be my favorite! She takes her time on everything even the massage! Its amazing and so relaxing!!   They have bottles of water for everyone.  The place is very clean and they have a ton of polish (regular or gel) options to pick from.  I also have to mention how AFFORDABLE this place is!! its amazing! Oh and they always have on the food network channel so dont come hungry or you will be drooling the whole time :)   They have won me over with just one appointment - new regular right here! Thank you Tina!!

My friends and I call this place Pink Chicken - not in a gross way.  They season the chicken and the color changes to a pinkish red.  Its unreal delicious.  I have been coming here since college (a long time) and the quality or flavor has never wavered.  I alway get the half chicken so I can have left overs.  The meal comes with choice of chicken or beef - warm tortillas - beans - pickled onions (so good) - salsa.  I always ask for more onions, grilled jalapeño and a small side of rice.  You combine all of this in the tortilla and you have pink chicken magic. You will not regret coming here!     TIP - ITS CASH ONLY (or check).

If you don't like LGO you are just weird...but really  A Few of my favorite things: Commuter Breakfast Sandwich, Croque Madame, Smoked Salmon Salad, Kale and Quinoa Salad, Caesar Salad, Tuna Salad Sammy, Chocolate Chip Cookies with Salt, Any of the pizza's but the roasted corn pizza will change your life.   Fallen Angel is really good if you are looking for one with meat .. yum! Oh and the baked wings.. there are no words! So pretty much anything and everything here is delicious!!   The english muffins are the best you will ever have but probably the most fattening as well, but who cares.

If you want seriously good Japanese knives- this place is your spot!!  My dad brought me here to get my Christmas present- to start my knife block. We got three amazing knives and I am so stoked to build my collection. Not sure of the guy's name- really nice and really knew his stuff and was truly passionate about the knives!

I am giving 5 stars for Antoine - Ladies if you are not weird about having a male give you a massage (I know some people are) you HAVE to ask for Antoine.  His hands are magical.  He's always happy and positive I love it.  I have had a few masseuses here chat my ear off the entire massage not him he just focuses and gives a killer massage.  Relaxation level is a 10.  I get a deep tissue with hard pressure working knots and fall asleep thats how relaxed I am.

I have been coming to this place since college (a long time).  They do the best gel manicure.  I have had my gels on for 3 weeks and NO chips.  Pedicures are a little piece of heaven with their foot massages they are longer and it's actually a massage vs. getting lotion rubbed into your legs.   Also, I always just walk in and have never waited more than 2 minutes!!

It's been some time since I have come here and have to say I am pretty disappointed!  This place was the best place to get pedicures and Gels! Now... They just want you in and out.   Came and got a pedicure and left looking like Edward scissor hands got ahold of my feet...really it was bad and had cuts on the side of my toes - the guy was aggressive. He was also super rude to another lady sitting next to me who had asked a question.  He gave her such a rude response she even looked at me and i'm just there deer in headlights.   Even though they still do a great gel manicure - probably wont be coming back anytime soon.  Another thing thats still annoying - they only take cash tips.  So if you don't have cash you have to use their sketch ATM.

I feel POSH eating here - I absolutely LOVE this restaurant.  I have been here twice for the "regular" menu and once for ramen night.   Rule 1: Always sit at the chef bar top so you can watch the kitchen or chat with the chef - it adds to the experience. They leave nice space between the chairs so you are not on top of other people either.   First experience:  I leave all options open, I will try anything and everything.  First Course:  A divine cheese uni.  This literally melted in my mouth and had so much flavor.  I wanted 4 more servings of this.  Second Course: Octopus over polenta - the octopus was soft and tender and paired so well with the polenta and green onions. Third Course:  Quail.  I called this the slutty quail the presentation cracked me up - legs up and stuffed. The meat was juicy and the skin was flavorful.  Fourth (dessert): Flan - I licked the plate..   Second Experience:  I cannot remember the order of what we had but I do remember some of the dishes; We had a very yummy monk fish I believe in a yellow sauce.  This was so light and not fishy.   I had the kangaroo over noodles- this blew my mind.  It was the first time trying kangaroo.  It is so lean and tender.  Paired with the noodles it was one of my favorite dishes.   Third Experience: Ramen night We started with the dumping appetizer.  These are great - and had the best crisp on the outside. We kept seeing a vegetable pancake going out -its huge and looks delicious.  It was ordered a lot so it has to be good.  We both got the seafood ramen.  Yumm- has a great seafood taste broth with Shrimp, Calamari and scallops.   They also have their own hot sauces.  Most places that have their own hot sauces are not actually hot and are just mild and crowd pleasing.  Now I like spicy. They have a habanero and ghost pepper hot sauce- its dynamite! Soo spicy - I couldn't stop eating it and putting it in my ramen.  Its addictive.   Each time I have been here it is always busy!  I recommend making a reservation.

This place is a little piece of farmers market heaven.  Fresh juices, coffee, produce, bread, plants! You could not ask for a better place. Typically have live music playing and spots to grab some of the best food. One is the pizza and soup the other is a chefs stand and the menu is different each week. I wish they were open more than Saturday's!

I have been on the hunt for the best Pho place since coming home from Vietnam and this is the best!  The beef Pho is full of flavor and you have all the sauces you need to make it your own.  Spring rolls are fresh and delicious.  Fresh coconuts are a must! Prices are also the best I have seen anywhere!

Stumbled upon this place while searching on yelp and had a great reputation so had to try it out :)   We were seated and greeted right away and had some time to look over the menu.  We decided to start with the Tom Yum soup- a bowl.  Not a huge bowl for 10.95 in my opinion but did not lack in flavor it was delicious and we ate it to the last drop.  My dad got the special curried duck - this was in a red curry sauce and had great flavor.  The duck was cooked perfectly.  The only thing lacking was vegetables.  It just had red bell peppers and pineapple (not a lot).  I had the Spicy noodles with chicken.  I am not complaining but there was more chicken than noodles and this too was lacking vegetables - I had bell peppers and thats it.    I have had these dishes in Thailand and else where and everything is always loaded with veggies and thats what I love.  They nailed the flavor and have a great menu just wish it had a little more to it.  Service 10  Atmosphere 10  Food 9  Beer 10 - they have Singha and Chang beer here - great Thai beers!

Called Ron yesterday late afternoon to get a quote to fix/replace our garbage disposal.  He gave me a quote and schedule to come the next morning!  He gave me a window of 8-10am and was there by 8:45AM.  He replaced and fixed out garbage disposal in 30 min.  He also took the time to show me how to check it should it ever stop working or get jammed in the future.   Would HIGHLY recommend Ron.  Very responsive, affordable and friendly and of course knowledgable.   Thank you Ron! :)

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! Hands down the BEST street tacos I have had - even better than some I have had in Mexico!! So authentic & so much flavor.  I order the Chicken and Steak - comes topped with Cilantros and Onions side of limes and cucumbers.  They have all the Mexican sodas, the best Horchata, and the delicious salsas.  Staff is very nice - and very quick! This place is always busy!

A little Cambodian Heaven in AZ - oh and BYOB!  - This is a great date spot!  I am so happy to have found this place, Cambodia is my favorite country and has the best food. The way I describe Cambodian food is a fusion of Thai with hints of Vietnamese and Laos cuisine.   Expect 20 min or so for food to be made FRESH but so worth it.  I recommend starting with the basil seed drink and the spring rolls while you wait - very fresh, healthy and flavorful.  Also family owned and operated- typically 1-2 cooks 1 waiter.   First we started with: Katheaw Cha Noodles Fat rice noodles with beef, shrimp, carrots and broccoli leaves.  Add some spice and this will be your favorite dish!  So filling and satisfying!  Next we had the Amok fish - cooked in a giant banana leaf - with a side of jasmine rice and cooked in a delicious curry sauce.  A traditional Cambodia dish and MUST TRY! (takes a little longer to cook).  Atmosphere of the restaurant is very cozy with paintings and traditional decorations and music.

This place is a little piece of Ethiopian heaven!!  To start the injera bread is huge and so delicious I could eat it for days!  The Ethiopian salad is so tasty and the jalapeño gives it a little kick. We had the cabbage and collards both cooked to perfection.  Can't beat the prices for the amount of food!  Will definitely be coming back ... A lot!

I feel like it is weird for me to like this place since I'm not a pork eater!! Lol but they have some awesome stuff!! First my favorite is there cilantro margarita  with sirracha- you think this would be weird because I did and my friend made me try it... I'm hooked.. I'm dream of these things they are so good!! The Brussels sprouts are just unreal- crispy with sprinkled cheese and a friend egg!  Not a fan of the green chili Mac and cheese- not a lot of flavor and wasn't hot at all.  Now I am admitting to have tried the pork- the tostadas and pork belly tacos are seriously unreal. They almost converted me over.

Have been here a few time and never disappoints!   The short rib tacos: perfection! Perfectly cooked and marinated and just the right portions.   I could eat the chips and salsa all day.  Cheeseburger with jalapeños and fries is hangover heaven.   Bottom line, everything here is delicious!!!

Came here because my boyfriends flight was delayed so I thought I would come try this as I had heard amazing things to kill some time!   To start the sushi is very very GOOD!  I had the citrus Yellowtail & the Hory Fork Roll! Both delicious and I will definitely come back again.  I give them 4 stars because of the atmosphere and the people that were dinning next to me (who were employees eating after a shift) extremely loud, vulgar and just annoying to be honest.

The best place in town for eyebrow threading and only $8. I have always been a walk in, most times there is a wait because its starting to get popular but I haven't had to wait more than 10-15 minutes.  All the girls that work there are great.  If you tell them exactly what you are looking for they nail it.  Eyebrows on fleek.

Oh the amount of phone screens I have broken in my time... Anthony is a phone life saver.  I have broken my screen at least a 1/2 dozen times and each time I have come to Anthony.  They have great prices and the work is awesome - fast and quality work. Always leave looking  brand new (until I break them again).  He has even helped fixed an Apple laptop that we spilt water on and was dead but Anthony revived it!!  He knows his stuff - if you want quality work from a cool guy this is your place!!

Tried this place once in the old location and it was terrible.. not much else has changed in the new location... and really $3 for chips and salsa? Food was terrible.  Had three different types of tacos (grilled Fish, Carne Asada and braised short rib) and they just didn't do it for me.  No flavor - needed to ask for limes and salsa to even make it decent. They give you tap water that actually tastes like dirty water from the canal and the house margarita is probably the grossest thing I have ever tasted.  Zero tequila and nasty sweet and sour mix.  Blah  Stick to bottled beer and you should be good!

Shabu my Fondue!! This place is the tits!!    I had previously been to the Thai restaurant connected before Sabu was finished and abosoltely loved the food so I knew I wanted to come back to try the new concept! My boyfriend and I came here for date night - I was overly excited as I have been dying to try this place - and it did not disappoint.  We were instantly greeted and asked to wait just a moment before being seated as they got our table ready and waters down.  We were given the menu and a run down of how everything works. Can I mention they have SE Asian beer options - I was so freaking happy!!  We ended up ordering the Shabu Steak (I would recommend getting the Wagu), deheaded shrimp, ice tofu (AMAZING- soaked in ice water and this technique allows the tofu to soak up all the flavor of the broth), broccoli, babycorn, watercress, the Enoki (string white mushrooms), baby bokchoy (you get a lot), rice noodles and rice - yes we over ordered and don't care because we were in fat kid heaven. Another visit we have ordered the scallops, lamb, chicken, organic beef - all of which I cannot complain. They were all great flavor and taste.  We did the Ying Yang broth - the House Spice & House Herbal each unique in flavor - you can also get it vegetarian style which is awesome!  My favorite combination is the lemongrass and house spice! Soo good.  It such a fun experience and would recommend to anyone looking for a fun date spot or even a group event (they have a long table down the middle for large parties).  Service, food, atmosphere all exceeded my expectations and cannot wait to go back - probably this weekend.

The Tavern is open for lunch and I highly recommend!!  The best sliders EVER!!!   They delivered our office an amazing lunch that everyone enjoyed- Mr. Tarbell brought the food himself for our first order (what other restaurant do you know who would do that).  They brought an array of sliders (Beef, BLT and Chix Salad - all unreal delicious)  A butter lettuce grapefruit salad, Kale Salad (favorite), Crispy Shrimp lettuce wraps, Green Chili Pork Stew, Chicken Tacos and Deviled eggs.  All unique flavors and tasty!! YUM!

I have been coming to Casa Mia for years!!! This is hands down one of my favorite Italian spots in the valley.  Worth the drive where ever you live! The family that owns and runs the restaurant is absolutely amazing!   Here are just a few of my favorites:   To start you must try the Burrata with Proscuitto. I also love the Bruschetta & can never go wrong with the Caesar salad!  For Pastas: The Linguine & clams, Gnocchi, & Spaghetti Alla Checca (recommend getting this spicy)  all three are full of flavor delicious!   ** Always find out what the specials are = never cease to amaze!!

Came here for Sunday brunch with a group of friends and all excited to try it out as we had heard some great thing ... But left really disappointed To start, Waited over ten minutes for drinks and a Bloody Mary that tasted like sink water with an entire jar of pepper... Also had a side of arugula come out with dirt all over it.  Food was mediocre and came out all cold and had to send a dish back to even melt the cheese. Another friend had a hair in his meal.  We even tried to ask another blonde waitress for help and before we got what we were asking for she responded "ya ya ya" ... Haha thanks for not helping and being a nice person  And I understand splitting a check 15 ways sucks but was a bit of a process that took more than 30 minutes  This would be a one star but I've served and a lot of the issues was not our servers fault ... He was nice enough to take the dish with hair and terrible drinks off our tab. This falls on the kitchen and bar- I'll be surprised if this place makes it

I have been wanting to try this place for some time as I had heard nothing but great things and thought it would be nice to take my mom out for restaurant week & they had a great menu.   I have to say the whole experience was strange, but my review is not about service - we liked our server.  He joked around with us and was light hearted.  It's about management and the chef, and I really hate leaving bad reviews but at the end of the day this was not handled properly.    First we came in greeted by a gentleman and then a blonde woman, mind you she still had sunglasses on top of her head at 6pm.  She came and started talking like we weren't standing there to the guy about wanting to put us at table "blah" but it was still seated so lets move them to table "blah" - then went on some weird ramble about the tables.  Mmkay... Come to find out she's a manager.   We were taken to our table and quickly greeted by our server with water. He talked to us about the restaurant and how it was a duplex, etc. Then we ordered.  First course came out, mom had the potato leek soup, and I the Brie Brulee.  The soup was delicious, but very thick and filling.  The brie was warm(ish) and came with bread crisps, grapes, and pears oh and one strawberry for color lol.  Nothing fancy and honestly was surprised by the presentation or lack there of.   So my mom ordered the steak.  She eats steak maybe twice a year- she's not a meat eater! When she does order steak she likes it like a dang hokey puck, well done no red, it freaks her out.  To me, a person who loves meat, this is just a crime - but to each their own right. We  joked with the waiter about this and all was good.  Out come the steaks ... mine was a perfect cut of filet. Very tender, juicy and flavorful.  It paired very well with the mushroom creme sauce and mashed potatoes.  The asparagus was burnt but I actually liked it. Now, when my mom cuts into hers she comes to realize she was given the end cut of meat with all the fat and gristle. This is the cut I give my dogs- no exaggeration.  It almost looked like cutlets that were attached by fat. Bottom line it wasn't a good cut of filet.  She got upset thinking the kitchen gave her the crappy cut because she's getting it well done so may as well give her the crap end cut if its going to be cooked to nothing. Now this may not have been the case but none the less she was upset and took it as an F-U from the kitchen/chef. Regardless of the situation, the piece was not good and shouldn't have left the kitchen.  We let our server know and then it just got awkward....  He obviously wanted to rectify the situation and make it "right" and asked what she wanted in replacement or what he could do, she said nothing she was just very unhappy and wouldn't be back. The exchange went on for a solid three minutes of "let me fix this" and "no, thank you" at this point I was getting uncomfortable. It just wouldn't end.   Then comes the manager - the previous blonde greeter (Helena)- over to try and fix it as well.    My mom just shut it down saying everything was fine nothing to fix she was just done.  I expressed she was upset by the cut of meat and again my mom said just don't worry about it.  The manager didn't really have any words she was like "oh, um, okay are you sure."    We then sat there for a while waiting for my dessert ( I mean I still wanted it) as my mom decided to decline anything further.  I was happy with my food so I was obviously going to keep eating. They brought out TWO creme brulees.  For one, my mom ordered the pear and I the brulee.  She said she didn't want anything so they brought me two? Sadly, it went to waste, I can't stomach two desserts.  We then wait to get the check (10 min) and when we get the bill they took half off my moms portion- $20.  I have to say I was honestly surprised by this.  All she ate was a small cup of soup- she sent back the steak and didn't have dessert.  We honestly weren't expecting the bill to be changed but any restaurant I have ever worked or witnessed an issue like this - typically the manager presents the bill and that meal is taken off. Neither of which happened.   As we left "Helena" goes "I hope whatever it is your dealing with gets better" - I'm sorry, whatever we are dealing with??!?!   It took me a second to have that process and all I could do was laugh... is this person with her stupid sunglasses on top of her head at 8pm really ending it all with that comment.  What we dealt with was a bad experience, and crappy cut of meat.  Apologize, take it off the bill and take it as a learning lesson. Nothing was handled well.. at all... and now you are the reason I am writing this review.  She is a terrible manager/ hostess with not the mostess, whatever her role. She is rude.   I give it two stars because I did enjoy my meal and though the ambiance was nice.

Kathy and Bill are the BEST!  These bikes are soo much fun! With a group of friends we rode down through the Papagos to Tempe and back to Old Town.  Would recommend to anyone in town visiting fun way to check out the town or anyone looking for a great weekend outdoor activity!!

Accidentally stumbled upon this place yesterday and SO glad I did!  Walked in and got a massage right away!  I am a big fan of Thai Royal but I have to say this place give TR a run for its money.   While your feet are soaking in warm water they do the head and neck massage, move to arms and hands, then feet and legs.. then the best part .. the back!  They do a full lotion back massage then finish with hot stones.  I was in heaven!  I would highly recommend asking for Peter! AHHMAZING!

I have been here twice and enjoyed each time. Service is top notch.   Experience one: came here with a girlfriend and decided to split a few dishes.  We started with the calamari, which is now one of my favorites. It doesn't have the traditional marinara dipping sauce but instead a tangy vinaigrette which I. My opinion is so much better. Then we got the mussels!! These are sooo good the flavor is amazing - also come with a tasty piece of corn bread! Lastly, we had the real California roll with kale salad! This this was huge but so good with the real crab! Kale salad was perfect!   Second experience: came here with my boyfriend for my birthday.  We came in Sunday and Sunday's they have 1/2 bottles of wine!! Yes please! For food started with the he amazing calamari again then the clams ( they changed the mussels out) theses weren't my favorite- flavor was blah and the clams wee very small.  The bread was also burnt black. That's the best part is the bread and sauce. ( I did ask for new bread and they forgot and ended up giving us a gift card because they felt so bad on my birthday- so unexpected but so awesome). My boyfriend got the chicken which everyone knows you don't order chicken at a restaurant because that's lame - and he regretted it. Super generic much better options on the menu. Lastly we had the lemon pie - oh my fluffy lemony yum!!! We crushed this.  All in all awesome experience both times will definitely be back!  Oh and don't forget on your way out to grab the little sea salt chocolate cookies that they have from LGO! Those things are gold!

Such an awesome spot!  Smaller place with a long communal table and a bar top to watch the chefs do their ramen thing! Has a fun authentic feel to the place.   I ordered the Ultra Spicy Ramen - add tofu and bamboo.   The broth is SO flavorful.  The spice level was perfect for me.  I am not a big pork eater but I will say this pork melted in my mouth.   I will say this is a lot of food so come hungry!!

This place is an absolute GEM!! I'm a SE Asian food fanatic and this place is topnotch!!   The restaurant is very clean and great ambience - greeted with smiling faces of everyone in the front and in the kitchen.   Our server was very friendly and patient.  I of course arrived late to my dinner and my friends had ordered.  Our server was very quick to get my order and get me my food out.  I also took the advice of a fellow yelper and got the thai chilis with fish sauce and vinegar - holy hot batman!! It burned so good!  If you wanna add some spice - GET THIS! I put it on top of my Tom Yum Fried rice (which on its own is soo tasty) but with some spice and a splash of soy sauce its on another level.   No thai dinner is complete without mango sticky rice (purple sticky rice I will add) - just melts in your mouth.   I also had a few bites of my friends Red Curry - so much flavor it was hard to only have two bites I wanted to finish her plate.   If you are looking for authentic, flavorful food and service with a smile (no pun intended) I would absolutely recommend Smile Loa Thai.  I will be back... a lot
