best Mediterranean food in the valley,  love the open kitchen layout, it makes for a great show on a Friday or Saturday night, the live jazz on Thursdays and Saturdays makes it worth the trip from central phoenix for me.  i got hooked at the location in Tempe when i was going to school, Samir was running it then( one of the greatest chefs in the southwest) they still use many of his recipes and maintain his style.  they have a few locations all over the valley. Chandler, with the pond, the patio, and the interior layout w/ live music this is with out a doubt their best location, ask your server for the details on the dishes it will make your decision a lot easier, great wine list too and again allow your server to guide you in the right direction.  healthy fresh food, great prices, great service, creative atmosphere.

i lived here now for five years and it looks like i still fell into a tourist trap, was attracted from the outside by a a lot of nice bikes, inside nothing special   .........lots of room, not a bad property,  just nothing unique aside from extra motorcycle parking, the menu is struggling due to the lack of a kitchen  go there to drink beer and smoke cigs .......and of course show off your sunday cruiser

shhhhhhh!!!!!!, this place is hummmm........ lame!!.......especially on Thursday nights with their amazing jazz band is playing, every week it seems harder to reserve a seat.( that is my only complaint) the word is out.       Perfect, a wine list for days and an in house all star jazz band! the staff are very attentive and do very well considering the vast wine list.  great seating and long bar, designed to look like a speak easy, the lay out is great. Super cool date spot.

i have now lost 3 hair dressers to Seattle since i have moved here i don't know what's going on but anyway, that's what got me to salon tru, just moved to Scottsdale, there it was on the corner that i passed every day and finally when even my best hat couldn't hide all my hair, i pulled in for what i fear the most.....a walk-in hair cut......ahhhhhhhh.  but what a great experience, large facility, amazing staff, everyone in there could have their own place.  just walk in and leave with a great hair cut and hair stylist for life* **  * or until they move to Seattle ** stylist does not actually leave with you

where is the love? something was missing with my last visit to Joe's New York Pizza.......where is Joe?!?! i admit it has been at least a year since i have been in there last.( i got hooked on the other side of the street with best of Italy pizza) i couldn't get enough people to agree on one type of pie so i got a few slices.  They were big slices and the crust was thin, they might have had a chance if they were not "marinating" in the window for an hour.  i like to load up on parm and crushed red pepper after I'm through with condiments it all tastes the same but nothing i can do can hide far from fresh product.  if you find yourself on that side of town and need late night food check out Best of italy or Philly Sandwich(24hrs!!!wtf) on 5th ave and scottsdale

great place to go with friends and unwind they have a great patio, and being in AZ that is everything (esp. if you smoke)  the menu is diverse the food is New Mexican, not mexican (being from Jersey i can not tell you what the difference is only that there is one).  portions are big, again catering to groups and making it more of a hang out then a date spot   go green chile!

i have been ordering from here for 2 years, haven't had a bad experience yet, no matter what i order they tell me it will be ready in 10 min, which gives me just enough time to run out the door and get there, it is always perfect never forget a thing.  Family run business explains the quality and consistency.  they don't pack their dishes with vegatables, hate it when you have to look for the meat like your digging for a prize, the prices are great and the portions are huge, crab angles are home made and very good......get them!  you are about to find your new chinese food spot...and bonus! its right down the street from blockbuster.  ....................do it

met up with some friends here between classes at ASU, it is a good get away and not  hectic during lunch,   the sandwich was.....what i expected, which is not a bad thing at all  for me its hard to mess up a cold sandwich( just no mayo!!!!!!, they did anyway and i had to fight to get a new top with out the mayo)   great beer selection, good stuff on tap and the server was very friendly and attentive....to the bar tender and fellow server,as for us i had to remind her that we her table and then the mayo incident, it happens no matter how many times you say no mayo some places it just still slips, no big deal until i ask for a new piece of bread and i thought i was going to be asked to leave.   i tried not to rant but here i go......... why do some places think that everyone loves mayo on everything its nuts!!!! i feel i am fighting a losing battle getting the word out, but i got to do something i tried and loathe the stuff......any-hoo....if you are on mill check them out for lunch you'll get a good cold sandwich and a great beer to go with just be patient with the help..... god bless them they are nice to look at but might be confused as to what their job there actually is..........go get me my freakin sandwich and no mayo!

I have never been in such an amazing property and had such a horrible time, made arrangements one month in advance for a friend of mine booked it with Erin( if she is not fired yet end the conversation as soon as she gets on the phone)for 20 plus 23- 26yr old women.    after waiting out front for 20min Erin cleared the guests to enter, she then attempted to pass off a room that had seating reserved for the guest bartenders guests, being obviously overbooked she then tried to tell me i was obligated to buy 6 bottom shelf bottles (at a price i am too embarrassed to mention, ) and seating for maybe 4,  after about 20 more minutes of yelling back and fourth over the music she tried to have the now 20+ guests escorted out, birthday girl in tears we moved the party back in to another friends table to try and save the night........stay away, lame scene, horrible service, with so many options in old town this is not where u want to find yourself any night of the week.........on top of it the local police have to have at least 3 squad cars parked there all night, clearly the staff has no control over the customers. that is the last thing i want to walk past when i leave the club with my friends.....

the best in Az no doubt, fresh corn bread comes with everything , the sides are huge and very inexpensive wow!!! try the spicy fries (they are not too spicy) the BBQ sauce is amazing perfect for the dry rub ribs you can make them as wet as you want..... love it ! get to know the owner Ivan he has got some great history about his business, lots of good stories, he is in there everyday everything is always perfect and how it should be Ivan gets a strong 5 stars because even if you hate BBQ you have got to give this place some play

wow biggest scam artists in the valley, if a rep for this company walks into your business swiftly walk him out, they are the best in the business for a reason they know how to price gouge and get customers with b/s promotions. listen to this  my friendly sales rep Angelo espisito ( who also has a specialty item distribution business on the side with his wife) gets my business from sysco by telling me that if i go exclusive with them for 8 weeks they will take the average of sales over the 8 weeks and give me a check for  the amount of one week, wow great deal......not!!!!!  at week 7 and 4 days into the promotion i get a notice from the company that they noticed one of the weeks we were only @ 80% of our ordering through them and because of that they will not be able to honor the contract, big surprise.  So after  $45,000 plus another 5,000 to sue them i got about 30,000 in product, and yah!! my one week rebate, U.S foods and Sysco do business with competitive pricing and great service not smoke and mirrors

great product, cool concept and atmosphere, would get the 5th star if was more welcoming to hanging out and enjoying with a cup of coffee, but i also can respect the fact that this place is strictly business.  like any place if you get there during a rush you are gong to wait, but the trade off is fresh product neatly packaged a for sure spot to check out in old town

hello group my name is Aaron and i am an addict........ i neeeeeed real Italian food.......2 things i miss most about home the ocean and the food, i am talking about eating a dish that has been served the same way out of the same kitchen for longer then you have been alive, it is tradition some pass on and as much part of them as religion.  much of east coast cooking moved west is lost in translation.  Amen!  Joey Aiello and thank you for giving me a place i can recomend in confidence as "my italian spot" you truly make me feel at home.   the bread is amazing perfect and fresh served with an olive oil, roasted red pepper and eggplant blend, be careful you need to pace yourself for the large portions that are soon to come, the menu is perfect, i could write a page about each dish ( i will spare you and my poor typing skills) the pasta is fresh and makes every dish come together perfect..  Unpretencious, warm, inviting, delicious......... love it !

this is the real deal, best pizza in scottsdale and top in the valley, these people know what they are doing, east coast style( way east ........Italy not New York:) big slices, perfect crust, and the cheese snaps when it is cooled just right and you bite into it.  with food i find beauty in its simplicity and a large cheese pie from this place is fore sure a beautiful thing

is it a restaurant or a bar? i am not sure. we went there late night because we asked around and it was one of the few places that still advertised having a kitchen open, it seemed like over 70% of the menu was "sold out"......sold out form last week? we looked around the restaurant to see what everyone one was eating and it looked like food from everywhere in old town except cin cin kitchen. Joe's pizza looked good 2 guests were enjoying it and another table was eating cheesesteaks so we went to Philly Sandwich and wrote that place off as a huge waste of time.   attn. owner- spend less on the bouncing staff (gorillas) and put the money into keeping your kitchen stocked, would have loved to try the food....... if there was any....i can get a 9 dollar G&T any where in oldtown

E for effort, they give it a good try, good piece of meat but i watched helpless, as it was cooked to.....to....o i hope the wiz can save it. ..... it did, it always does.  i grew up on these ingenious delights and sometimes you just have to have one.  and please some one who knows tell me about.... Corleone's  why the godfather name?, and references? New York yes! , Philly .....No, had to ask they couldn't tell me, and the question lingers. anyway the staff was very friendly and i got my food fast and fresh. fries were nothing special but again nothing the wiz couldn't fix ( so i love wiz you would understand so i won't try and explain) the cheez fries are loaded wit it.
