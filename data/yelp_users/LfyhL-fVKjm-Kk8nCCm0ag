I have been to this Pei Wei multiple times and it never fails I am always disappointed! I have dined in and they lose my ticket and I have to show my receipt to get my food. For take out they forget my sauces and utensil and just tonight I called to order take out the girl was very rude and it was an hour and a half wait! My recommendation go somewhere else...

Love this gym, the trainers are awesome! The workouts are good and balanced! They combine strength and resistance training in their bootcamps. They can adjust any workout or exercise for any fitness level! Coming from a physical therapy student I appreciate that they focus on proper form and that they are safe! They don't have you doing excessive weight you can't handle and will cause you to get hurt! They appreciate their clients and take our opinions seriously and even do appreciation days :) try underground you won't regret it! Bootcamps are a fun team atmosphere! I look forward to workouts because of the awesome people I met at underground and the relationships I have built!
