I have been with Desert Schools Bank for apporx. 25 years, they used to make you feel special and offer great service and benefits. As the years go by they started acting more and more like a bank as their corperate mentality kicked in. I'm not sure if they were purchased or just went sour like most all banks. I had a home Mortage and a car loan there, both paid off. 2015 was the end for me, my wife had a couple of surgeries and missed time from work, then my wife lost her job. However we got a little behind on ONE of our many accounts, A joint account. All of a sudden the bank takes $250.00 out of my checking account the week of Christmas with no warning. Now that's just disgraceful customer service. Their now outsoarced Credit Cards started raising raising their interest rates and fees just like all the other banks as well. The last straw was when I called to pay off the balance of the account and was treated so rudly by first the woman at their call center and then by her boss, a manager of sorts somehow. At the end of the call I couldn't believe the way I was treated. I've never been called by a debt collector, but it couldn't be much worse. They told me they can take away my money any time they wanted, I then asked them if they normally drain someones account during Christmas or were we special. This man shouldn't be in any customer service position at all, very confrontational. He needed to prove his manhood at the office I guess, at this point he all but told me he was just going to take all of the money we owed out of my checking account, which he did within five minutes. I'm paying on a loan there and still have a direct deposit with them to do that, but surprise, they now are charging me for my checking account. I was told that would be free as long as I have direct deposit, that's a lie, They also started charging me other fees as well for who knows what. This bank can not be trusted with your money. They pretend to be great when times are good, but as soon as you have a temporary setback they attack your assets like a loan shark. Just when you need a month or two to get things straightened out. I already took my business somewhere else as did my wife, her daughter and son in law. The death of a once great Credit Union, Welcome Desert Schools Bank. We are back ahead of our bills like before despite these predatory practices we had to endure over the holidays. I hope you all had a Merry Christmas. I'd stay away from this bank if I were you.

My father has been going there for years and I have met him there. I recently started going there on my own and found it to be an excellent place to hang out or eat. They are a sports club that actually shows hockey games, WOW what a concept. I've also enjoyed singing karaoke there and now they have free comedy shows to. The food is also great and priced fairly. I found a new place to hang !!!!!!!!!

This club has changed a lot over the years, but this version is by far the best. Nice people hanging out and singing karaoke or watching comedy, or what ever brings them in. This is the best karaoke in town, bar none. Pappa T does a great job. The free comedy shows are also the bomb. Great job guys, keep up the good work.

The place has changed hands and I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the decline, but this used to be the place to hang out, not any more. The last couple of times in, there was a short heavy dark haired girl doing the karaoke and she is just mean. I hope she goes away soon, I'm sure that would help. Even the comedy shows have gotten clicky. If your not a favorite, or member of the club, your treated very unprofessional. The bar staff has always been good. I  hope they get the karaoke turned around, there are at least good people running that, otherwise you can do better without trying very hard. At the very least you would think the people representing the club would be nice.

Well we went on a Fri. for happy hour early around 4:30. The girls at the hostess desk asked us if we had a reservation, no hello, welcome, go piss off, nothing. We said we were here for happy hour, they didn't care anymore. We walked into the lounge, where every single table was reserved for somebody, now I can see why the hostesses didn't care, we weren't important enough. The place is very unwelcoming for new patrons. They don't even have enough stools to cover sitting at the bar, which is what I like to do. We ended up standing at the bar. We couldn't leave because we were meeting somebody there. The tables didn't start filling up until 5:30 or 6. It looks like a Vegas style set up where you have to purchase your place ahead of time or stand. The only positives were the happy hour buffet, the kind waitresses and the cool bartenders other wise the score would have been zero. We didn't try the restaurant, that does have it's own bar. That's the only thing we may try in the future is going in there to hang at the other bar, unless it's all reserved as well. I'm very big on happy hour fun and this is not it.
