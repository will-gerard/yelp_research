I had a burrito enchilada style and it was huge and amazing. I'll definitely be coming back on a regular basis!

Don't waste your time or money here. I went in and paid for a hand wash because I don't like running my cat through automated car washes. When I looked the cat over there were big spots that had been missed and when I pointed them out the "car wash professional " proceeded to try to wipe dirt and road grime off my dry car with a dry towel. Huge no no. Later that day I noticed spots on the hood and roof thay had car wash soap that hadn't been rinsed off dried on them. Needless to say I will never be back.

Different... that's the best way to describe this place. It's more than your average burger joint offering a wide variety of toppings and "stuffings"  I will be a returning customer!
