The prices are fair, especially for those attending sports events downtown. The food is very good, especially for BBQ fans. We tried the macaroni and cheese, which came with bacon and chicken, and had excellent flavors. The hot links are a nice, simple, flavorful BBQ sausage appetizer. We also tried the BBQ sampler platter, which comes with ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and hot links. The ribs were the best and are probably a good item to try as a standalone dish. The drinks come in huge ~32 oz glasses, so you probably won't need refills. There are plenty of huge screen TVs located around the dining room for watching sports. There are also many rock memorabilia pieces located around the restaurant.

I went to a few Suns games recently and got to check out this stadium. It is rather clean and has a fresh style. The concourse is huge and has some odd and extravagant things, such as a full-size kids arcade and a few bar/restaurants. There are lots of souvenir and concessions located in the stadium, which makes lines small and getting things fast. The are also diffent varieties of concessions available at different places. I noticed that the upper level of the stadium has less traffic and crowding, so it may be a better place to go to the restrooms or shops. The view of the court is pretty good from anywhere in the stadium.

I've been to DBG two times. It is a nice place to go to be outside, see various desert vegetation, and take photos. The second time I went on a Monday, which was great, because the park was not crowded at all. There is a main trail in the park, which takes about 30-60 minutes to tour. There are also several smaller trails and side-exhibits to explore. The butterfly tent has different butterflies at different times of the year and is a great place for macro photos. DBG is a nice place to make an annual visit. I recommend going on a day that is not too hot and making sure that your skin is well covered. It seems that weekdays may be less crowded, which is great for photographers.

This Apple store is smaller than any of the others I've been to. It was also so crowded that there was little room to move or to try out the products. We wanted to test Siri on the iPhone 4S, but there was some kind of info session going on and every single device was occupied for the entire time we visited. This was a bit disappointing.   There are three or four Apple stores in the area (Scottsdale, Chandler, for example) and I recommend visiting those ones instead.

I ordered the spicy pork. The flavor of the sauce was good and the meat was cooked well, but it was also very stringy and fatty. Overall, the food was mediocre. The food prices are too high for the quality offered. However, the portion sizes are quite large, so there should be leftovers for extra meals.  Our service was terrible. The servers would not look in our direction for 20 minutes at a time. They did not once visit during the meal. They brought two dishes out 10 minutes before the others and brought one person's food out 15 minutes after everyone else had their food. We had trouble paying, since they would ignore us and wipe down an adjacent empty table even though we were clearly waving and yelling to them.  The combination of terrible service, average food, and high prices ensures that I will not return.

This is the best Asian mart I have been to in the area. It is quite large and has aisles dedicated to nations all over the world. The selection is pretty good, but it doesn't have everything. It does get crowded on the weekend mornings.

This is my new favorite Apple Store. While there are a ton in the Phoenix area, and the one in Scottsdale is also excellent, this location has some unique benefits. It is a smaller store tucked away inside the Chandler Fashion Center mall. Unlike most other Apple Stores I've seen, this one is not packed with people all of the time. If you need to talk to someone, get a new release product, or receive service on your products, you might consider this location. It is likely to be an easier in and out process with less waiting compared to the more popular locations.  The other great story with this store relates to my New iPad. The original that I ordered online came out of the box with a defective screen. I made an appointment and brought it into this store. In a matter of minutes, and with no hassle, they replaced my broken iPad with a brand new one. While I would have had to wait weeks for a replacement to come in stock online, this store made the swap simple. Considering the lack of crowding, I would probably plan future repairs and appointments here instead of other stores in the area.

It was at this location that I discovered a delightful appetizer. Oregano's version of mozzarella sticks features crispy fried crusts with a zesty breading and a spicy, melted, pepper jack cheese center. To top it off, you get a side of true hearty pizza sauce for dipping (not that wimpy marinara that you get elsewhere). The thing is, you won't want to dip, because they are so tasty on their own. But not all is lost, because the pizza sauce is good for eating straight out of the cup.   Although I specifically discussed a lighter cooking of the pizza cookie with our server, who agreed that it isn't supposed to be charred, it nevertheless came out overdone. I'm not sure what it is, but 75% of the time across all of the Oregano's I've visited, the pizza cookie has come out overdone. Alas, this is a dessert that tastes substantially worse once it becomes overcooked and requires delicate attention. Now that I have discovered La Bocca on Mill has a superior version of this dessert, I won't be ordering it anymore when I visit Oregano's.

Arizona Mills is a rather large mall and has a number of good outlet stores. The IMAX and movie theater are good for catching a show. The mall gets extremely crowded and it can be difficult to navigate through the mass of slow-walking mall zombies at times. The food court is one of the dull spots, as it is occupied by cafeteria-style fast food chains. However, there are some better snack shops scattered throughout the mall.

We stopped into this location to try a few sweet treats. This factory has just about every combination of chocolate and nuts that you might want. It also has some different options, like chocolate covered miscellany and dried fruit candies.  We tried the chocolate-dipped cheesecake, which is literally a massive slice of cake on a stick that has been covered in milk chocolate. It was very rich and sweet. We also tried the dark chocolate macadamia cluster, which was excellent as well.  The prices here are consistent with most desert places and the creations are of high quality. It is a good choice if you are feeling like a gourmet style chocolate dessert.

This is the first place I go to whenever I'm in the area. It has a very unique style of food that you won't find too many places. The Ethiopian sour dough bread is a great canvas for the various saucy dishes. You can also ask for a hot pepper sauce on the side, since the dishes are not too spicy. The Jamaican ginger beer (soda) is an interesting drink and very powerful, although it is not for everyone. There is basement (downstairs) indoor seating and outdoor seating along the street. This place also has a food truck nearby in case you do not want to dine at the restaurant.

This is a classy hotel located right on/near the UW campus. The location is unbeatable. It is about one block away from the waterfront and UW Union and about a 10 minute walk from the Capitol. The price is a little bit higher than some of the other local hotel options. However, it has a nice traditional style and very friendly staff. They will leave you little extras like chocolates and weather updates daily. There is WiFi, but it was spotty at times. You have a few opportunities to pick up breakfast, snacks, and dessert throughout the day in the lounge. This is a place that I would stay again.

This is a very high end mall and not somewhere that I would buy anything. There are tons of fashion/clothes shops, so perhaps it's good if you like that sort of shopping. There is also an Apple store, which is cool. I visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded. For the number of large and fancy malls in the Phoenix area, this one doesn't measure up for me.

We visited the Mirazozo exhibit here, which was excellent. It was very colorful and great for photos, although you will need to be patient with all of the crowding. There were also many other activities around the center, such as LEGO building stations for kids and human statues that were interacting with visitors.

We unexpectedly found this landmark in Oldtown Scottsdale. The older man and woman who work here are very friendly. They will ask you to sign the guestbook, which seems to be very important to them. The museum has interesting information and artifacts from Scottsdale's early years. The 100-year old newspaper was an interesting read.

RA is a mini-chain sushi restaurant with a few different locations around Phoenix. It has a unique blend of sushi-fusion dishes and everything I've tried tastes great.  For an appetizer, I recommend the Shishito peppers. They are fresh and grilled whole. On the side, is a very spicy red sauce and in the center of the bowl is a savory sauce with chopped garlic. The peppers can be quite spicy themselves, but this is my favorite dish at RA.  The sashimi is very fresh and has the melt-in-your-mouth texture that sound sushi should. The Tunacado (ahi Tuna appetizer), miso soup, and Sencha tea are all good sides.  The service is acceptable, but not exceptional. The food prices are a little high, but the food quality and portion sizes are also very good.  RA is one of the best sushi restaurants that I have found in the Phoenix area and it worth visiting for anyone who likes sushi.

Elements is an upscale restaurant located on the Sanctuary resort. The restaurant has an amazing view of the surrounding mountains and is great for sunset dining. There are windows surrounding the whole dining room and there is lounge space located outside on the patio and in the bar area. The design of the restaurant is clean and modern, but also classy and intimate.  We originally tried to make a same-day reservation, which wasn't an option. Instead we had to plan two days in advance and there were plenty of times available. We ate at 6 PM and the dining room was pretty empty, but it was full by the time we left. The parking is valet.   To start, we had the shishito peppers and a Fiery Mandarin cocktail. The peppers came in a huge bowl and were placed in a very unique sauce with citrus, garlic, and creamy flavors. The drink was a tasty citrus martini with a slice of jalapeño.   For entrees, we tried the Korean short ribs and maple duck. The ribs melt in your mouth and come in a sweet hoisin-like sauce with pickled vegetables and jasmine rice. The duck is cooked perfectly to be moist and tender. It comes with a striking and powerful black bean sauce and a sweet forbidden rice.   For desert, we had a cup of black current tea, which was pleasant. We also tried the PB bomb desert. It came with a nutella spread topped with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and cocoa nibs. The PB bomb itself was a crispy wafer topped with whipped peanut butter mousse encased in a thin dome of dark chocolate creme. It was incredible and easily the best peanut butter creation I have ever had.  The servers were friendly and knowledgeable. There were a few times when we waited a little longer than expected, but nothing too bad. The prices are high, but the overall value for the dining experience is great. Unlike many upscale places, they aren't afraid to provide you with plenty of food here, so you won't go hungry. The really amazing thing about Elements is how well the Asian fusion is executed. It has taken classic Asian foods and created unique dishes that you have never heard of or would find anywhere else. If you have a special occasion or the opportunity to vacation in the area, Elements is an excellent choice for unique, Asian-inspired fine dining.

This is a small Italian restaurant. There is seating indoors and out, as well as a small bar area. The decor is modern and looks clean and new. There are only two servers covering the dining room, which may lead to long wait times during a meal and less than expected service quality. However, the staff members are very friendly.   The garlic verde shrimp is an excellent appetizer. The sauce is amazing. I tried the lobster ravioli. It was rich and cheesy. I enjoyed it, but probably would not get something that heavy again. I also tasted the grilled salmon, which was cooked and spiced perfectly. The prices were reasonable and the food was good, so it is a place I would visit again.

We went on the 90-minute tour. It was rather busy when we arrived around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon. Fortunately, they added an extra tour time to accomodate everyone. The tour guide was very informative and told stories about Wright and the history of the school and property, which were pleasant and personal in tone.   There are a few outdoor portions to the tour, so I would recommend dressing appropriately, bringing sunscreen, and borrowing one of the umbrellas provided by the tour. Also, it would be good to bring water, since there is only a vending machine at which beverages can be purchased.   We were not prohibited or hassled at all about taking photos, which was nice. However, the tour tends to move fast, so you will want to time yourself well if you are interested in photos.   The tickets are a little pricey at roughly $25-60 per person depending on the type of tour. There is a student/military discount of about $5 per ticket. The gift shop has a ton of books and some other interesting decorative items based on Wright's designs.   Something I wish we could do is to take a self-paced tour. I personally prefer to explore things at my own leisure and be able to take photos. This is not possible with the current setup, since they are very strict about who goes where and when while on the property.

I have been to RA a few times and 2-3 have been at this location. My most recent meal here was incredible.  The shishito peppers are a must-have. The ponzu sauce had us tipping the empty bowl over to lick, drink, and pour on our remaining rice. It was that good.  We tried the Pacific Roll, which is essentially the experience of eating fresh mango salsa. It's not what I would call sushi, but it was tasty and refreshing. The sashimi is solid as well. The lunch combo is ~$10 and they will mix and match any 7 pieces of tuna/salmon/yellowtail you want.  This location, located in downtown Tempe on Mill Ave, is a bit more of a club/bar style than the others I've seen. They play lots of upbeat club/remix/techno music at all times of day. The service was friendly and decent.

I rented several times from this location. The staff members were always friendly and came to recognize me as a customer over time. I did not have any hassles with getting the right car, pricing, damage, insurance, etc. Wait times were reasonable to none at all on my visits for both pickup/returns and handling the transaction itself. I do recommend avoiding peak times, which seem to be at opening, closing, and lunch. This location can get very busy. Around 10-11am worked very well on my visits as this appears to be a less busy time.

Oregano's is an institution in the Phoenix area and for good reason. It has a solid offering of well-crafted Italian dishes, from bruschetta to ziti.  Yet, when I visit Oregano's, it is inevitably for a helping of their thin crust pizza. It starts with a light, crispy crust that's cooked to perfection. The sauce has an excellent taste. I like to add a side order so I can top off my slices with a little extra. The cheese and toppings are fresh and flavorful. I recommend the pepperoncini's for spice, along with a savory topping to balance out the meal. The wheat crust option is also nice for a subtle change.  A recent sweet discovery, which was thankfully recommended by a server, is the pizza cookie. This massive 6-inch diameter cookie is served in the deep dish pizza pan in which it is baked. It comes in chocolate chip and white-chocolate macadamia flavors (or best yet, half and half). This dessert is a must-have, regardless of what you order, so be sure to save room and share it with your guests. The pizza cookie makes me not want to eat dessert anywhere else.  This location is close to the university and packed on a regular basis, which can lead to long wait times towards the later evening hours. I have heard others recommend alternative nearby locations, which are supposedly less crowded.  Lastly, I'll relate a story from one of my first visits to Oregano's. In brief, we ordered a pizza and started to wonder what was going on after about 90 minutes of waiting. Shortly after and without any word from us, the owner/manager arrived with our pizza, apologized for the delay, and removed the full cost from our bill. This event demonstrated Oregano's willingness to take accountability for its service, which is all too rare.   Oregano's is a place that you must visit at least once. I suspect that anyone who visits once will return many more times.

I've finally visited this place twice now after taste-testing a sample of their food many months ago. I'm not vegan/vegetarian, but this is still a great place to eat. It's a place that I will definitely visit again.  The buffalo wings are a must-have item. The spicy buffalo sauce incorporates fresh garlic and scallions and is better than I've had anywhere else. I get this appetizer every time I go. The Thyme fries are also a nice appetizer. The fries are thinly sliced, nicely spiced, and not greasy.  The dishes are quite large. I have tried the curry and kung pao entrees. Both had nice flavors, but could use more sauce and neither blew me away. The mock meats used in their dishes are very impressive, especially in terms of texture. The appetizers, for me, are large enough to be a meal. Meanwhile, the entree bowls are big enough for two people.   There is a nice collection of house drinks, including lime, lemon, vimto (red fruit drink), and green tea. You can mix and match them as you like and refills are free.  For desert, there is a collection of tsoynamis, which are a soy-based ice cream in DQ Blizzard style. I tried the betterfinger version, which was good, but extremely sweet (like eating cake frosting).   The order line gets backed up to the door, even during off-peak hours. By the way, you order at the counter here, get your own drinks and such, then pick a place to sit. The staff only deliver your food and you clean up after yourself when done. So, this is not a traditional, sit-down restaurant. The environment is very rustic/wooden and laid back. The prices are fair. The staff is very friendly.

The main parking lot fills up fast, so arrive early or plan to park in one of the side lots. The seats are comfortable and the theater design is very nice. The outer design of the theater is incredible and great for photographs. I had no trouble getting into or out of the theater for the show. It is worth watching for discounts for students and others with ASU affiliations.

I tried the chicken sliders, which are supposed to come with chicken, marinara sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Unfortunately, I was informed well after ordering and paying that there was no marinara sauce (the ole' bait and switch), so I was forced into having BBQ sauce instead. Nevertheless, the food was pretty good and had a nice grilled flavor. A nice touch was that the bun was grilled and the cheese was nice and melted.   The cashiers are very friendly and nice. There are a ton of people working the grill, yet the output seems very slow. All vistors pay and get a number up front, then wait 5-10 minutes for their food. Considering that this is basically a stationary food truck, I would expect numbers being shouted and food flying out the door fast and hectic, rather than piles of customers standing around waiting for their orders to roll out one by one every few minutes.   The prices are outrageous for what you get. It is reminiscent of a sports stadium or airport approach. The shop is knowingly overcharging, just because it has an audience due to its location right in the middle of a college campus.   Although the food was reasonably good, the long wait, bait and switch, and high prices make me doubtful that I will return. There are too many better lunch options in the area.

The environment at House of Tricks is classy and casual. It is a rather quiet and relaxing place. Indoor and outdoor seating is available. The outdoor area is sort of like a patio/garden area, which makes it feel intimate.   We tried the Korean baby back ribs and ahi tuna for dinner. The ribs came with 5 large pieces that a lot of meat on them. They were well cooked and sauced. They tasted much like good American ribs, but with a more Korean-style sweet and spicy sauce. The ahi tuna was lightly seared on the outside and rare on the inside. There were five square slices on the plate, which were crusted with sesame seeds, topped with fresh wasabi, and placed atop a Teriyaki-style sauce. These small additions made the dish even more flavorful, although the meat alone was perfect.   For dessert, we tried the salted caramel apple bread pudding. The salted caramel brought a strong, sweet punch, while the bread pieces were buttery and warm. There were very few apples in the dish, which was fine since they appeared to be soaked/preserved in some kind of syrup. Also, I did not care for the whipped topping because it tasted like apple pie spice instead of whipped cream. Aside from those two items, which were easily avoided, this was a pleasant dessert. Each bite was warm and tasty, which made the dish feel good to eat.  The entree prices are $25-30 per person, which may sound high, but the food quality is great and the portions are plentiful. The servers have a hands-off style in which they survey their tables and only intervene if it appears you need something or if you address them. I like this approach, because it is not as disruptive as the more common routine that restaurants employ. I recommend House of Tricks as a place for excellent food in a relatively quiet, intimate environment.

For some reason, the pump wouldn't take my Visa card. It beckoned me to, "please see cashier." Fortunately, I had hours to spare and was delighted to spend my afternoon with the Shellmart cashier, which is precisely why I pulled into a station with automatic electronic pumps. Alas,  the pump subsequently decided to accept a MasterCard, which prevented me from journeying inside to sample Shell's stale generic-brand Twinkies.

This is a great place to get fresh, organic, and other unique food products. Some of my favorites are nuts, berries, and the rare dark chocolate covered snacks, which make a great trail mix. This also the only place I have found chocalate mochi ice cream, including stops at several Asian markets. It is usually not too busy, but it can be. There are lots of open registers, so checking out is very fast and easy. Sometimes there are food samples available in the store. The prices can be high, but you're usually buying things you can't find anywhere else.

I had heard of Pizzeria Bianco some time ago and even tried to visit once, but there was a 3-4 hour wait to get in. However, we happened to pass by this time on a Saturday at 4 PM and walked right into the last table.   The service here is simple and fast. There is really only one server, host, chef, and busser working the entire place. Although it is small, I am still impressed at how they coordinate and work together to serve everyone. Right when you need them, they are there and when you don't, they're gone. Why do other places have such trouble figuring this balance out? Clearly, the employees at Pizzeria Bianco are sharp, skilled, and care about meeting customers' needs. Our pizza arrived literally three minutes after we ordered.  The pizza is cooked in a brick oven, which leaves the crust nice and crispy, the cheese gooey, and the toppings juicy. We tried the Sonny Boy, which comes with tomato sauce, mozzarella, olives, and salami. Everything was cooked perfectly and the thin crust is much appreciated. The olives are quite powerful, so be careful if you aren't a fan of those. The salami topping was crispy and flavorful. The pizza came with a ton of toppings that covered the whole thing. The sweet organic iced tea was refreshing to drink.  The pizza had six large, thin slices and was perfect as a light meal for two. Heavy eaters and larger parties will probably need to order a few pizzas. We came just before the dinner rush and got in without trouble.  I recommend Pizzeria Bianco for a light and tasty brick oven pizza in a local, friendly atmosphere. Visit during off-peak hours to avoid long wait times.

This is a great place to attend a conference. It is spacious with many different sizes and types of rooms. The building has charming historical architecture and decorating. Downstairs is some of the best ice cream in the Midwest. The UW catering team has the best food I have ever had at a conference by far. The terrace by the water is spacious and great for evening/night activities. I always look forward to visiting here.

Parking is impossible here. There are no directories around when you need them. The mall is split up across a busy street and several sectors. There is literally one, ill-placed entrance to the mall, which is impossible to find. I think this place was set up just to experiment with insane rabid shoppers, because I can't see why anyone would choose to go here knowing what it's like. Tis especially true considering the abundance of nice, new malls in the Phoenix area that are much more pleasant than this one.

Restaurant Mexico was a place recommended to me long ago by people familiar with AZ food when I was first coming to town. I have been there many times. The food has a great home kitchen flavor and is on the more authentic side than most Mexican food found in the US. The service has been hit or miss on my visits, but is generally okay. The food prices are very low. It is easy to fill up on great tasting food without spending more than $5-10 per person. Chips and salsa come free at the start of the meal and are pretty good. My favorite item is the chorizo. I recommend getting it on tostadas or just as a side bowl with a few tortillas to fold on your own.

I'm a big fan of the Oregano's and most frequently visit the University Drive location (review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/oreganos-pizza-bistro-tempe#hrid:8voZ-Ol5ovGYBkkQDjREkQ)  This location has more spacious parking and a larger, covered waiting area, both of which are nice. We visited at off-peak hours, so I can't say whether this location gets busy during dinner like the University Dr restaurant.   The food was excellent here. We tried a thin crust pizza with applewood bacon and pepperocinis. This was one of the single best pizza's I have had. For dessert we ordered the half macadamia nut, half chocolate chip pizza cookie.   There were a few idiosyncrasies on this visit, however. Our pizza took a long time to arrive and came with added pepperoni by mistake, but we were happy to have it. We ordered a pizza cookie and the first one came too burnt to eat. Our server brought it just in case, but had already placed an order for another one. This lead us to have to wait a long time, but we were happy to get a properly cooked dessert and the item was taken off of our bill. The wait staff were friendly and efficient throughout, although I wonder if there are some problems or in-training staff in the kitchen based on our experience.

This is somewhat of a small stadium, but very nice for watching basketball. It is very clean and modern in its design. The view is excellent from anywhere in the stadium. There are ample concessions and restrooms located around the concourse. Just watch out for the idiots throwing things and drunkenly punching each other up in the student section.

I've been here a few times and always had great food. On the latest trip, I tried the duck quesadilla. It's the only time I've seen duck used in a quesadilla, but the meat was plentiful and had an excellent flavor. The tortilla and cheese were cooked well. It also came with a blood orage habanero dipping sauce, which was incredible. The fruit flavors made it almost like candy, but then the habanero packed a huge punch of spice. I definitely recommend this dish.   Another tasty item is the chips and guacamole appetizer. I don't typically like guacamole, but they do a great job here and mix in a lot of fresh ingredients. You can ask for salsa on the side as well.  The staff are friendly and courteous. The menu items are priced fairly. Although it is located way out in the middle of nowhere, this is a place worth trying for a nice Mexican-inspired meal.

This may appear to be a rundown classic theater on the outside, but it is surprisingly a nice modern theater on the inside. It has a single full-size screen and seating chamber. Just in the door are the typical concessions found at any Harkins theater. Overall, the place is pretty clean.

The parking is very spacious at this mall, which is a big plus. I usually park by Nordstrom and cut through to the main hall of the mall. Unlike most huge department stores connected to malls, there is no annoying labyrinth to struggle through and getting through is easy.  I've been here a couple times for the Apple Store. The Apple Store is a somewhat hidden location. There are several large Apple Stores in the area that tend to be very crowded. However, this one is a bit smaller and hasn't ever been crowded when I have visited. The service is great, too. Otherwise, I have not explored many of the stores at this mall.

North Mountain Park has a few different places to park and a number of different trails to hike. Although it is large, the park seems to get crowded, especially in the morning. I only got to hike up Shaw Butte thus far, but there are clearly plenty of trails to warrant more visits. The paths in this park are well-worn, which make it more convenient to navigate, but less natural. There are some excellent 360 views of Phoenix from atop the mountains, but you have to work to find them and not be afraid to leave the established path.

This is one of the best dimsum I have had in the US.  The service was amazing. The food carts and bussers circle the dining room continuously and are there to drop off foodie pick up plates immediately. You can also ask for specific dishes if you need to.   The food was excellent. They do not skimp on their items. All of the dimsum pieces were packed with meat and each dumpling was good for two large bites. The contents were juicy and flavorful. You can also choose from a few diffent flavors of hot tea, including oolong. A few of the dishes that were especially good were the stir fry noodles, Shanghai dumplings, and siu mai pork dumplings.  Lastly, I was amazed at the price. For two people with about six dishes and drinks, it was under $20.   I definitely recommend Phoenix Palace Buffet for anyone looking for dimsum in the Phoenix area.

The Street has excellent Thai iced tea and milk tea. These items are priced at about $3.50 for 20 ounces.  The walls are filled with artistic graffiti, stickers, and scribbles, which give the place a unique grunge feel.  I will definitely go again to try more of their teas.

In one line, I don't recommend Grigio Tempe Town Lake to you. I recommend that you look just about anywhere else in Tempe. Don't even waste a second considering this place as your next residence. Read along for the details.  Let's begin the negatives with a list of the slightly less than criminal offenses:  1. The office staff is incompetent and disingenuous. If you need help with anything more than retrieving a package, they will resort to ignoring and lying to get you out of their hair. They don't want to help. They just want you to go away.  2. If you lived here, you would have a lot of trashy neighbors. The first month we moved in, the people at the end of the hall were evicted. We noticed that their door was destroyed and repaired on multiple occasions (like someone tried to break it down with a sledgehammer) and they had daily violent F-word shouting fights. Several other neighbors left rotten garbage outside their doors for a few days at a time, then mustered the immense strength necessary to drag it into the parking garage (not the trash chute that was equally close). In fact, there were always people leaving garbage around and getting evicted throughout this complex. There were also tons of people partying loudly every night of the week. As others have noted, the people driving around the property are all texting with no hands on the wheel and at around 80. Be aware of the caliber of tenants that infest this property.  3. Don't bother calling the on-site security about the above. They are worthless and will just deny that you called or claim that "we checked, but didn't see/hear anything." Call the real police if you have a problem.  I won't go without mentioning a couple of the good things. First and foremost, the location is great for people affiliated with ASU or Tempe/Mill. Both are a 30 minute walk away. Second, the maintenance staff was very good. They are friendly, good at what they do, and respond quickly to requests.  Now it's time for the big, bad one. The management at Grigio Tempe Town Lake doesn't care about the condition of the property nor the health and safety of residents. This is true of all three management teams that were in place while I lived there (three different managements in a short timeframe should also be a red flag to you).  A few months after we moved in, some people moved in a couple floors above. They threw loud late night parties about four nights a week. Worst of all, every single night they trashed our patio. The patio was completely covered with spit stains, cigarettes, ashes, food, and other garbage that was thrown down every single day. I started reporting this to the office within the first few days and the management never did anything to solve the problem. This went on for over two months with no action whatsoever by the management. Worse yet, I wasn't the only neighbor complaining about these misdeeds. In spite of all the calls, emails, visits to the office, and over a hundred photos documenting the damage caused by the bad neighbors, the management ignored us and outright denied there was any problem. After a few weeks, I wrote the corporate offices and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB). Apparently, these actions were enough to get the management to acknowledge us for the first time after over six weeks. Yet, they still denied the problem and tried to pass it off as nothing. No reasonable person can think that it is normal for one tenant to throw spit, cigarettes, and garbage all over another's property on a daily basis. Even more insane is that the management went to such great lengths to protect the people who were doing this, rather than just getting rid of them and restoring peace to the good tenants and the community. I think this story speaks volumes of the caliber of management that infests this property.  Grigio lost several lease renewals over this incident alone. Furthermore, I predict that this place will be a complete slum within a year. Any decent human being who lives there will be driven out by the horrible tenants and management. The bad ones who stay won't pay their rent and will trash the property more and more. The management at Grigio Tempe Town Lake just plain doesn't care about you, the property, or the community. They want you to suffer and live in an unsafe, unhealthy home as long as they get your money. If you have even the slightest amount of human decency, you would not enjoy living at Grigio Tempe Town Lake.  I have elaborated quite a bit, but feel free to send me a message if you have any questions. Be sure to look at the other reviews on this place and you'll see plenty more of the same. Also, look at the filtered reviews and check out Grigio's horrible BBB rating.

This is a nice place for boba teas. There are tons of different flavors available and you can also get just regular green and black tea. Most flavored tea places don't have unflavored/unsugared tea, so it is nice to have the option. I also tasted the plum green tea, which had a unique and interesting sweetness. In addition, this place has a selection of fried foods and snacks, including fish balls, but I have not tried them.

Let me preface by saying that I almost never eat fast food. Nevertheless, I think I can list about 20 fast food places that I find superior to this one.   I finally stopped in to try In-N-Out after seeing the rather large parking lot at this location permanently full and hearing the rantings and ravings from people all over the universe about the franchise.   First, coming within about a square mile of this place will put you in a (likely life-threatening) nuclear fallout cloud of grease - so extrapolate that a bit to think about what I experienced walking into the actual door of the building. Second, I was a bit disappointed to see that they literally sell only hamburgers and fries. Why are there not a few other American fried food classics like onion rings and chicken tenders, or even a few different styles of burgers or related entrees? Third, I would say that the cheeseburger and fries that I had were pretty terrible, even as far as fast food goes. It is kind of like putting that aforementioned greasy nuclear cloud into your mouth and intestines.   This really makes me wonder why anyone marvels at In-N-Out, unless they've never had anything else. For anyone who likes In-N-Out, I would recommend perhaps a Steak 'n Shake or Culver's as a well-rounded, higher-quality, still affordable and greasy fast food place. Since this is the only In-N-Out I've been to, I can't say that there is anything particularly wrong with this location. Instead, I can confidently say that I'd choose almost any other fast food franchise over this one.

My favorite tea served at Tea Infusion is the Royal Coconut Pouchong. This is a perfect light oolong with a gentle and refreshing coconut flavor. There are also several black, oolong, green, white, and herbal teas available, so everyone can find something to enjoy. Moreover, any tea can be ordered hot or iced. In addition to traditional teas, Tea Infusion also has fruitier boba drinks and very tasty strawberry lemonade.  A nice touch is that Tea Infusion tends to have short-run specials that are unique to the menu. This is a great opportunity to try new things, especially if you aren't sure what you want coming in.  Tea Infusion is a great place to try loose leaf teas before buying them for your home. Most of the teas come from large vendors like Republic of Tea. Hence, they are of high quality, but not unique creations that you cannot find elsewhere.  Compared to tea houses, Tea Infusion is not a place where I would hang around. Instead, considering its location in the Tempe Marketplace, it is an ideal place to drop in for a takeaway drink before walking around the market.

We went back here for the first time since my last update and I can now confidently say that I won't be back again. I'm not sure what happened to this place, but it isn't the tea shop that I used to enjoy.   The staff is incompetent and didn't even listen to what customers said or even look at them. We even saw other customers get ignored and have messed up orders while waiting for ours.  Their tea menu has been severely cut and is missing the few good items that used to make it worth visiting.

Tempe Marketplace is a modern, clean outdoor mall with a variety of stores. For example, there is Target, BestBuy, Barnes and Noble, and Harkins Theaters. There are also a few different restaurants, including California Pizza Kitchen, Kabuki, and Red Robin. I go to Tea Infusion on every visit to get a drink before continuing with plans.  Look for shaded parking in the corners/joints of the large lots near planted trees. This market gets crowded on the weekends, so you may have to park away from the popular stores and getting in/out of the market is slow. Either way, you may need to walk across the large lots if you are going to stores that aren't in the same sector of the mall.  I prefer this mall to others in the area and tend to go there whenever it has what I'm looking for.

Although Qdoba is just one of the many "Mexican Subways," it is in a class of its own. The freshness of the ingredients and the explosive flavors set it far apart from the rest. This particular location is clean and has professional employees.  Having tried just about everything on the menu, I have a few recommendations. Invariably, if you stand in a line at Qdoba, every customer in front of you will order a chicken burrito. Don't do that. Although the burritos are excellent, I would probably rank them last on my favorites list at Qdoba. Instead, try something different.  For meat, I highly recommend the barbecoa (shredded barbecued beef). It sits around simmering in its own juices and spices all day, which cause it to have explosive flavor in every bite.  For dishes, the little known secret and best item on the menu is the tortilla soup. If you're more hungry than soup, get the Mexican gumbo, which has all of the contents of a burrito topped off with the tortilla soup. It doesn't get any better than that. My backup favorite is the quesadilla. They are always crispy and good for dipping in Qdoba's several tasty flavors of salsa ("hot" is the best, but they are all great).  The portions can be quite large at Qdoba and it can be hard to decide on which meal to have on a particular visit. Therefore, a nice option is the craft two menu. This allows you to pick two Qdoba dishes, each at a smaller portion than when ordered alone. Hence, you can try two smaller dishes and not get totally stuffed when you eat everything.  Make sure to pick up a Qdoba rewards card at the register. They are free, work at all locations, come with a free chips and salsa at activation, and earn you one free meal for every 10 that you purchase.

I originally saw La Piazza on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Guy Fieri and visited on one of my first trips to Arizona a few years ago. I was out driving around town today and decided to stop back in. There was no wait when two of us arrived at 11 AM on Saturday. I recall a line forming before the place opened for dinner on my original visit, so it is probably good to think about timing.   The restaurant is rather small, but does have a good number of tables. I noticed that they have revamped their decor. It is now darker, sleeker, more modern in style, rather than more of an Italian deli/pizzeria as it was before. Our server was friendly and observant. The chef came around to ask everyone about the meal after it was finished.   I am a fan of the pizza at La Piazza. The crust is extremely thin, while the border is light, fluffy and airy. It has a clean, fresh, semi-charred flavor. The tomato sauce is relatively plain, but adds a light vegetable flavor to every bite. I highly recommend the Italian Stallion pizza, which has pepperoni, salami, and sausage. The meats are high quality and the brick oven really brings out their flavors. This pizza manages to have a little bit of spice to it as well, which I really enjoy.  I have also tried a few other things. The stuffed shrimp appetizer consists of shrimp and crab over bruschetta-style bread. It is rich and flavorful. The herbs give you a nice pop with every bite. The cannoli is a nice traditional dessert, with flavors of cream cheese, cinnamon, nuts, and chocolate. I have only tried a bite of the baked spaghetti, but it is a massive hard to be believe cube of Italian food, just like on the show.  It is a little bit of a trip to get to La Piazza. I wish it were closer, so I could visit more often. I do recommend going, especially for people who like brick oven pizza and a casual, adult environment.

Roka Akor has many creative and tasty choices. We opted to try several small dishes over the entrees and every dish was amazing. The sashimi was the freshest I've ever had. I also recommend the butterfish tataki and salmon nigiri. The shishito peppers, sweet potatoes, and corn are excellent vegetable options.   The service at Roka Akor is phenomenal. The servers are perfectly trained, knowledgeable, and considerate. Several people assist the waiter with delivering dishes, drinks, cleaning, and questions. They all work to ensure that customers have a wonderful experience.  The prices are a little high, but completely worth it for the quality, service, and ambiance. It's easy to run up a high bill, so I recommend bringing a Groupon-style coupon.  Roka Akor is one of the finest places that I have dined and I highly recommend it to others.

There are a lot of interesting works of arts and crafts on display from people with a variety of taletns. One must-have on your visit is the kettle corn. Make sure to get it from the guys on the corner of 5th (I think) with the tent and huge stirring pot. They are there every year and have the best popcorn.

I've been to Famous Dave's before, but only once at this location. We decided to split the full slab of ribs, which is a great option for two people (or an insanely massive portion for one). The ribs were a little on the well-done side, but had a pleasant char-grilled flavor at the same time. The ribs had plenty of meat and were tasty as-is or with the addition of extra sauce. For sides, we tried the green beans and fries. The fries are a great choice for sampling the sauces, although we also received a complementary bowl of BBQ potato chips when we arrived, which can serve the same purpose. The green beans were good, but a little bit plain, especially in contrast to the other items. I would probably go with the corn next time instead. As a sauce aficionado, I am very pleased that I can have free reign over five huge bottles of BBQ sauce at this restaurant. I like the spicier Devil's Spit best, followed closely by the sweeter Rich & Sassy. We had a friendly waiter who drew the pig mascot in every flavor of sauce as a way to introduce us to the options.

I have been to Cookiez on Mill many times and my only regret is not trying it sooner.  Cookiez has a wide variety of desserts, including Italian ice, milk shakes, ice cream, fresh lemonade, and fruit smoothies.   While all of its desserts are excellent, the shop is most famous for its ice cream cookie sandwiches. A sandwich entails the combination of one or two large cookies (~4-inch diameter) and 2-3 scoops of ice cream. These massive sandwiches come in half (one cookie cut in half, with ice cream between each half) or whole (two cookies, one on top and one on bottom) sizes and are great for sharing. You can choose any of the several available cookie and ice cream options to make your own custom dessert. I recommend the combination of a white chocolate chip almond cookie with mint chocolate chip ice cream.   The prices are quite low. A discount is also offered to ASU students and people who work on Mill. The owner is very friendly and always in a good mood.  Pass on by the chain stores and stop in to Cookiez. You won't regret it.

This is a great place for brick oven style pizza right in downtown Tempe. It has a trendy and modern decor that seems suited for a younger adult crowd. There is a large bar and wine menu that looks good, although I haven't tried the drinks there.  Instead, we went for the pizza. Our pizza had two kinds of olives, pepperoni, sausage, and peppers. The toppings were plentiful and bursting with flavor. There were a few too many olives, so be careful if you don't like those. However, as an overall, for me this pizza was on par with the famous Pizzeria Bianco in downtown Phoenix and just a hair behind La Piazza in Glendale.  It is a great find in downtown Tempe and certainly worth a try for people living or working in the area.

I've been to La Bocca a few more times since my original review. The pizza is still great and competitive with the other great brick oven pizza joints in the area.  The big feature in this update is the ice cream cookie. This dessert resembles the fabled pizza cookie at Oregano's, but is undoubtedly better. First of all, the ice cream is of excellent quality and comes in a couple unique flavors (provided by Sweet Republic). We had the mint ice cream, which had bits of mint leaves and chocolate chips in it, leading to an amazing fresh flavor (like an ice cream mojito). Second, the cookie was baked perfectly and had a large amount of chocolate in it. The warm cookie dough and chocolate had such an excellent flavor. Lastly, the dessert was reasonably sized for two people to share and indulge in the great flavors, but without over doing it. I wouldn't go here again without getting this dessert.

I've been to this location a couple times. On one visit, the baristas were so self absorbed with their petty personal gab that they had to ask my order several times, then proceeded to give me a terrible drink that wasn't made properly and was undrinkable. This location is very busy during the work rush, especially the drive through. I recommend going to a different location.

I visited Sweet Republic after hearing a lot about how good it was. We split the Pecan Turtle sundae, which was plenty large for two or more people to indulge. We requested to substitute one scoop of ice cream for a different flavor and it was headed without any trouble whatsoever. The pecans and salted carmel were bursting with flavor and richness. The ice cream was fresh and sweet. It is a good idea to share, since the sweet salty richness is a bit much for one person to handle. Overall, the desert was amazing and I would like to visit here again. I wish this place weren't so far away from home!

Of the several Asian markets in the Phoenix area, this one is my favorite. It is the only one that regularly carries chocolate Mochi ice cream and is also located next to the Taiwan Express, which is a great lunch place. It also has a good selection of moon cakes for the mid-autumn festival.

This place does takeout and has a small dinning area with about 10 tables. For drinks, the Thai iced tea, milk tea, and cumquat juice with boba are nice. For starters, the spicy wontons were very tasty. The meat inside was plentiful and flavored with herbs, while the sauce was excellent. The pork chops were a little greasy, but had a nice five-spice flavor that kept me coming back. The house special chicken pot is an excellent dish fit to feed two or more. The sauce is a tangy, light, and BBQ-like with an Asian style. For sides, the Szechuan green beans had a tasty chili garlic flavor. Overall the meal was very good and fairly priced. I have visited here twice already.

This is a major landmark in downtown Tempe. It is a great place for fast, small hike without having to travel out of town. The view is great for sunrises and there usually aren't too many people that get to the top early. You can get a good view of Tempe from the mountain, too. There are many people who use the mountain for exercise, usually in the evenings after sunset. The path is to the middle viewing area is paved and only gets steep in one small section. From there, concrete steps lead the way to the top. If you're adventurous, you might secretly sneak off the beaten path to other sides of the mountain, but be careful.

This is a bit of a hidden gem considering its inconspicuous exterior and location amidst a strip mall, gas station, and car wash. The interior is surprisingly large.   The service was pretty slow and they didn't seem too interested, but we did hear a little humor from one of the servers. We waited quite a while after finishing our meal and before getting the check. Our drinks were never refilled.   The food was quite good. I had the yellow curry with a level 5/5 spiciness rating. It was hot, but not overbearing and had a great flavor. I also got to try the tahm yahm goong, which was incredible. The soup had an excellent lemongrass and seafood flavor and was very spicy. I recommend these dishes. They were large enough for two to three people to share or for take home leftovers.  Overall, this is a place thst I would definitely visit again. It is also one of the only restaurants in Tempe that is open during the holidays.

We visited again and had better service the second time. The Penang curry (thicker, richer, milkier) was good, but I prefer the yellow curry (spicier, purer). The tahm yahm goong soup is a must-have. The papaya was okay, but we've had better. On the 5-point spiciness scale, I recommend a 3 for the soup and a 5 for the curry. See my original review for more details. This is a great place for Thai food.

This is about as simple and plain as you can get. The food is on a basic cafeteria level and is not very good. The service was fine. The prices are airport prices. There is nothing particularly bad, but also nothing very good either.

This little shop is located in the ground/basement floor of the UW Union. They have some of the best ice cream I have ever had. It even rivals my other favorite - the MSU Dairy Store. You can really taste the freshness and quality of the cream and milk used to make this ice cream. I recommend trying some of the unique flavors they have, as that is the best way to see what they do differently from everyone else. The salted caramel is excellent!

We split a breakfast burrito, which had a decent chorizo flavor, but the egg was fake and not very appetizing. The salsa was not good at all and we were afraid to eat it after visual inspection. I also felt a bit sick afterwards and this was the only thing I ate. Chili's express might be a better choice for airport dining.

Tea Time has a wide variety of unique, fresh teas and is a great place to taste something new. You can get both takeaway cups to drink immediately and bags of loose tea for home. The loose teas are sold in 100g increments and the prices are comparable to online retailers, like Republic of Tea. For takeout teas, be sure to get a punch card, which is good for one free tea for every four teas purchased.  Unlike the online stores and many other tea shops, Tea Time has some unique and local creations. The Phoenix Black tea has a rich and pleasant combination of honey pollen, caramel, and other flavors. The Mango Flip herbal tea is a sweet and tart blend of several fruits. In addition, you can create your own custom combination of two or more teas - for example Blood Orange and Chocolate Rooibos. These are just a few examples of the creativity that Tea Time brings to its craft. This is what really separates it from other tea shops.  The staff members know the teas well and are very willing to let visitors see and smell the teas. They gladly assist customers with choosing teas to match their tastes.  The one thing missing from Tea Time is a place to sit, relax and enjoy a few cups of tea. The shop is relatively small and has no seating, so it isn't the type of place where customers can stay and enjoy their tea.  I can see myself visiting Tea Time the next time I need to stock up on new loose teas for home. Its unique creations and wide selection will keep me coming back.

I tried Pork on a Fork at the ASU Tempe farmers market. Beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were sold there in a small tent.  My sandwich (brisket) was very tasty, albeit a little plain (just meat and bread). There were three great BBQ sauces available - sweet/mild, tart, and spicy. I used a lot of all three, but spicy was the best. I felt like I could drink those sauces!  At $6-8, the sandwiches are a little pricey, but they are filling and taste excellent. It would be nice if they came with some corn, beans, or the like to round out the meal.

Buffalo Wild Wings is a typical chain and the food is as expected. Two of my favorite sauces here are the Mango Habanero and Caribbean Jerk.   The dining area at this location has a ton of TVs of various sizes and most seats in the dining area have a good view. However, make sure not to get the corner booth near the stuffed animal claw machines. Some of your guests will not be able to see the TVs at all. I recommend asking to switch if you get placed there.  The service at this location is quite poor and the restaurant seems to be running at very low efficiency. To start, the hosts do not greet or even address customers as they arrive. There seem to be a ton of servers in the dinning area, but you never see any of them working. Instead, they stand around in pairs talking. Meanwhile, our food took about 15 minutes to arrive, which seems unreasonable for a fried appetizer and 10 of their trademark wings. Lastly, we only saw our server twice. One time was when we placed our order and the second (much to her fury) was when I had to walk our check up to the front of the restaurant to pay.

I tried the banana nutella cupcake. The cake part was banana bread, which was great. However, the frosting on top was way too sweet, tasted strongly of cream cheese, and no nutella flavor was to be found.  I really wanted macaroons, but was told they are only available Th-Sa. The prices are quite high at nearly $4 per cupcake. I likely won't visit again.

I went for lunch with a large group and the place was pleasantly empty. The decor is very modern and has a comfortable lounge style.  The chips and salsa are a great starter. You get three tasty kinds of salsa: brown, red, and pico de gallo. The tortilla chips are fried perfectly. They are extremely light and crispy.  I tried the steak tostadas. The meat had a food flavor and the tortillas were nice and crunchy. The red jalapeño and fresh cilantro on top brought excitement to each bite.   The dishes are small, but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each. Along with the chips and salsa, I got plenty of food, so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters. It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone.   I would definately go back for the food, but I wonder if this place becomes a standing-room only drunk fest when it gets busier and later in the evening (if so, no thanks).

This is a nice little Latin American themed restaurant. It has a very homey feel, like you're visiting someone's home kitchen. The staff members were friendly and working hard. We tried the chilaquiles, tortilla soup, and shredded beef tacos. The chilaquiles were very good, especially the tender pieces of flavorful chicken and the fresh green chili sauce. The tortilla soup was hearty and had a pleasant flavor. The tortilla strips and melted queso fresco inside added a nice touch. The shredded beef was marinated in interesting flavors (something beer/alcohol-based I believe) and made for a good light taco meal. The prices were fair, with entrees coming in around $10 and individual tacos at $2 each. The soup was very good, but at $6, it feels a little overpriced. Overall, it was a good experience and a tasty meal. They even gave me a tea refill to go afterwards. I would like to visit again.  I am concerned about the service, however. While the two people there were friendly and working hard, it was a tad bit slow with only a few tables occupied. Since it appears that the only staff is a mother/daughter team, there is no way they could adequately serve this place if it were half or more filled. There were tables filled with leftovers from previous guests as we left, which is another sign that it's just too much work to keep up with when understaffed. Thus, the experience of a diner during a busier time would likely be worse than my own on this trip.

Candy Addict is a nice place to stock up on all of your favorite candies. They have a great selection, including things you might not find in your everyday store. For example, you can get every flavor of Snickers/M&Ms and they even have the elusive Big League Chew. You can buy packaged/boxed candies or loose individual candies by weight. There are coupons/bonuses given if you spend more than a certain amount. This place is worth stopping in just to see and remember all of the candies you had a child. You are likely to find at least one or two sweet things to take with you.

I've been going to Mood Swings for over 2 years now. Jordan is my stylist. She is friendly and talented. The staff members are friendly and the prices are aligned well with the quality of service.   If you like, you can get tea, coffee, or water when you arrive. Something unique at this shop is that you can get a hot/cold towel and hand/arm massage, while your hair is being washed.   You can get a $5 discount for scheduling appointments in advance. There are also other discounts, such as for working on Mill or knowing someone else who goes to the same salon.

This deli has a nice collection of classic italian foods.   I tried the veal parmigiana and it was excellent. The meat was cooked perfectly and the ultra-thin breading magically disintegrated in my mouth. These were layered with tasty mozzarella cheese and marinara. It was a very satisfying meal.  I also got to taste the veal meatballs. These also had excellent flavor and were much lighter than typical beef meatballs. The meatballs had a nice herbs and spices. In the middle, they were very juicy and flavorful.  Order and pay at the counter in this deli as you walk in the door. If you are eating in, the cashier will deliver your food to your table when it is ready. The meal prices are in the $10-15 range and the portion sizes are huge, which allows for extra leftover meals. I would go to Aiello's again when in the mood for Italian food and in the area.

Paletas Betty has one of the best desserts I have found in the Phoenix area. The paletas are made with fresh fruit and nuts. They taste amazing.   We tried the pineapple and the pecan flavors. The pineapple was an explosion of fresh fruit flavor. The pecan had a rich, milky flavor that was accented nicely with the nuts. I recommend both flavors.  The person working in the shop was extremely courteous and knowledgeable. He explained all about the store and how the various paletas are made. He also answered our questions.  I will definitely be back to try more paletas and I hope that this shop thrives for a long time to come.

I have stopped in here for lunch and drinks a few times now. The teriyaki beef/chicken and bulgolgi have great flavor (I prefer the spicy versions). Their bowl meals come with plenty of meat and rice, while the bento meals also come with macaroni and slaw. These are affordable dishes and excellent for a lunch of easy take-out dinner. In addition, the meals are big enough that two people could split one.  The other item that I really like here is the boba. The milk tea and Thai iced tea both have a nice tea flavor and are not overly sweet like some places. Hence, it's also a nice place to pass by for a drink.

This is a very unique shop with all kinds of homemade trinkets, signs, and oddities. In the back of the shop is a little bakery area with drinks and desserts. I tried the hot tea and an oatmeal chocolate chip cashew cookie.   The tea menu has some unique flavors. The staff timed the making of the tea and had clearly tried them all, since they could describe the menu items well.   The cookies are the specialty here. They come in a sort of mound shape with a soft and chewy center. It is quite pleasant once you cut through the oats and hit a spot of warm melted chocolate. The flavors of the oats, chocolate, and nuts come through nicely.  This is definitely a place to stop by for a snack when you are in downtown Glendale.

I've been to the ASU health center a couple times prior to international travel. It has been newly renovated in the past year and the facilities are very nice. The staff work very mechanically, but efficiently, and my wait times have been very short. However, setting up and attending an appointment usually requires two separate in-person trips, whereas I'd rather take care of the pre-visit work electronically. The nurses I've met have been friendly and knowledgeable.

We tried two dishes: Lomo a Caballo (beef strip saute) and Tallarin Saltado de Pollo (linguine with chicken). The best part of the beef plate was probably the fried plantains, which were savory and sweet at the same time. The gravy/drippings also had a good flavor, which spread into the rice, french fries, beef, and vegetables. A couple of the beef strips were raw and therefore could not be eaten safely, which makes me wary of the quality control in the kitchen. The chicken dish had better spices and a similarly good gravy for the noodles. However, the flavors in both dishes were subtle overall. They had a nice home-cooked feel, but didn't blow us away or give us a desire to visit again. There was a nice starter placed on the table, which consisted of some kind of hollow, dried corn pieces and two tzatziki-like dipping sauces (one mild, one spicy). This was an interesting and pleasant dish to try while we waited a very long time for our food.   While the food was pretty good, the ambiance and service were not. The dining area was completely chaotic, with one assistant constantly running around moving tables and chairs... even our own after we had already been seated. There were tables noisily sliding around, chairs flying over my head, and my shoulders constantly being bumped by the two workers whizzing by in the cramped dining space. My other concern is the lack of cleanliness. The floors, tables, walls, etc. looked like they were not cleaned or maintained regularly, which is a health and sanitary concern. Ultimately, we waited about 15 minutes for anything to drink and nearly an hour for our food. The service was unacceptably disorganized and inefficient.   I can't speak to how this food stacks up against other Peruvian cuisine. The dishes were pretty good, although I would like stronger spices and flavors. The environment and service were poor. Overall, these items make it very unlikely that I would visit again.

This is a great place to watch a game. ASU is a top team and has a lot of great fans. The stadium fills up fast, so get there early. Tickets for tournament/playoff games sell out, so make sure to buy in advance. Try to sit so you aren't facing the sun. It's a good idea to wear a hat and some sunscreen as well. Single game playoff tickets run about $12 and weekend passes are around $20. Restrooms, concessions, and ATMs are located in the stadium. Ticket pick-up is right outside the stadium entrance.

I recently discovered Wing Stop and have already tried their boneless wings three times. The boneless wings have light, crunchy breading that isn't greasy. They also use big chunks of white meat chicken, so you get a good amount of meat as well. There are about 10 different flavors of sauce to try. My favorite so far is the cajun. It's a very spicy combination of buffalo-style sauce and cajun herbs/spices. Next, I like the Louisiana rub, which is similar, but dryer and less spicy. Some other good flavors are BBQ, Hawaiian, teriyaki, and lemon pepper. The boneless wings are priced nicely at $0.60 each every day of the week. I have also tried the seasoned french fries, which are pretty good, but not a must-have.    The wings are made to order, which means you should expect to wait about 10 minutes after placing your order. There is a small dining room at this location with about 10 tables, but you can also order take-out at the counter or call ahead. The staff has been pretty friendly on my visits. I would say the quality of service and food crushes the nearby Buffalo Wild Wings, so I will definitely choose Wing Stop from now on.

I had a very bad experience on my last trip and likely won't be coming back. I called in my order and was told it would be ready for pickup in 14 minutes. I didn't arrive until about 20 minutes and they were clearly in disarray. Nevertheless, I waited at the counter for another 20 minutes (40 minutes total now), before canceling my order and asking for a refund. The manager had the audacity to give me a disgusted attitude while processing the refund and said, "we're backed up tonight - I've been telling people 14 or 20 minutes." Well, 40 minutes is ridiculous and far, far longer than both of those "estimates." If you're going to take an hour to serve wings, then be honest; don't lie to me, waste my time, and then insult me on top of it. This behavior is completely unacceptable.

We visited early on a bit of a cool day and the misters were blasting over almost every table and chair in the entire place. After we finally located a place that was relatively dry, someone finally did shut them off. We had some annoying flies swarming us, especially after the food arrived, which was not pleasant. Our server was working for the first day and did a decent job, especially considering that he had clearly not been trained. We only had one round of drinks, which isn't enough to judge the quality of the bar. However, I get the impression that this is a bar first and foremost, rather than an eatery. Aside from these points, the general location and outlay are quite nice, especially for downtown events around Mill.   Yet, I would not recommend this as a place to eat. While the food is cheap and different from your typical bar burger, it was a bit on the bland side. However, the small bits of carne asada that I got were very tasty. If they could increase the size of the tiny bits of meat and build the meals more around it, they could probably have some pretty good dishes. The chips and salsa were also pretty good. Our server nicely brought us a squeeze bottle of the salsa to use, rather than the tiny plastic cups that we started with.
