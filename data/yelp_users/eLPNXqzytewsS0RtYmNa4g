Do not really enjoy baseball that much, however, one bartender, Julian really made my experience very pleasant. Very attentive, and knew all my friends drinks when we walked up. He knew are name and was the difference of what a game should be like!

Stopped in on New year's eve and sat at the bar for margaritas and appetizers. Alex was really friendly and the ceviche was great. We will definitely be back for dinner.

Tacos are o.k. There are alot of great non-traditional tacos available! Service is non-existent, unless you sit at the bar with the long haired guy, who also makes great margaritas!
