Is it wrong to review a church? Maybe. o well. I'm getting maried here next year because I wanted my out of townies to see why i love phoenix. ( or at least what there is to love) I like and appreciate most churches in downtown environments and this place takes the cake. It reminds me of a lot of churches back east, plus its the only basilica in the state. just don't ask me what that means. the building is beautiful, most everyone is nice. And there's less homeless folks milling about than at the older churches back east. Or maybe its just the homeless people here are more well behaved because we have nice churches and good weather? who knows.  The only downside to this place is that some parishoners have WAY too many non- well behaved small children with them, who tend to flounce around on the floor and shout. Not cool.

Like Amber- I want to hate this place. There is just so much hoopla in this country over some pizza and the like. What Panne Bianco gets right is  -quick, polite, but personalized service -a great short menu with no surprises -great "to go" options -big portions (when a sandwich and a drink cost $12 it better be good) -close to my work, wishing they would move into my work's cafe space -its right by lux -its food that any single person could make at home with a sandwich press, but doesn't b/c high quality bread and the like go bad too soon  the somewhat bad- wierd hours and parking kinda high prices no place to "sit" and "wait"

This place is such a nice break from ....well...every place else? You DO get what you what you pay for. The art, for the record is NOT the attraction. The location is a wierd place near the biltmore is So So. Atmosphere and drinks are killer. Yay for Merc. Yay for no smoking. Seriously people, it causes cancer.

As my husband has been re-doing landscaping and building our courtyard, we've been here several times and are 0 for 4. Today's example: we looked at several samples of stone and went inside to see how much a bag of one type was. The response was that they don't carry bags, only 5 ton minimums plus a $95 delivery charge. Then, we asked about smallish boulders, like those we saw near the stone samples. They replied, "Yes, we have those, they are 10 cents a pound, but they are really heavy." So we asked about how much the small boulders (as in 2.5 feet or smaller) weighed or about how much they cost....and they had no idea. In fact it was almost like they didn't want us to buy anything. weird. It would have not been so bad, except this was our 4th trip there and they have nothing we needed or asked for, and didn't seem to be upset by that at all. We also went to another local place before resorting to Home Depot. sad :(

We rode our bikes here ther other night and had a wonderful time and dinner for two + 2 drinks for $25. The food was very fresh and the patio is great. The "hold in the wall" feeling Nikki talks about is dead on! Try it out sometime when you just don't know where to go!

So this is a 2.5 star review kids. Great parking, great hike, great view, friendly people. BUT COME ON! the trail signage is pretty bad and inaccurate. My friend and I are decently experienced hikers and we got lost twice. A 3-5 mile hike turned into 7 miles.

You know, anyone who has your safety in mind when putting chemicals on your head ( like a hair dresser) or holes in your body is my friend. Glen and Kelsey are cool, I run into them around town from time to time. They are great local business owners and really know what they are doing. They only do piercings, which is awesome b/c really, I dont want some guy who just did a tat putting holes in me.  I had my industrial piercing done there while I was in college in Tucson and it healed so nicely. Only sore for about the first 2 days. I get comments on it all the time! I wanted to get my eyebrow pierced, but they said it might look really funny 'cause I don't have much of a browbone. Now, I 'm so glad I didnt do it, they were right. If you want a deal on someone putting holes in your head- don't go to Halo:) Even if you don't want a piercing, check out their selection of jewelry. If you have a navel piercing thats bothering you, they have jewelry to remedy that- along with a really impressive selection of just about everything else. OH_ THEY HAVE COUPONS IN THE NEW TIMES....

Deb K took me and fellow co-workers here. The sala and chips were great. Great service, good beer, and its clean too. What? The mini chimis were pretty good, but I only had two b/c the salsa and chips were SO good. They even served us chips and salsa before they knew for sure if we were gonna order something besides beer.  The mini chimis were an appitizer, but even 4 of us couldn't finish them! Go Mi Patio.

My girls Cheryl and Joanna know hair.  Cheryl is so sweet and you know when I'm this blonde-(and getting married) my colorist and I see each other a lot. You have to trust someone to put chemicals on your head. Plus, Cheryl styled my hair for a recent photoshoot ( see my pics )Enough said.

Have to agree with Cory O's review. Love this place...my wedding ring came back a little to large- but the girl sizing me warned me about maybe ordering a size smaller- but in case my hands swell- i didn't want to get stuck! I've turned so many people onto this place, I hope they appreciate the business. The owner "udo" is a little weird and snobby- but his staff is cool. You can get a great ring there for about $250, my fiance's wedding ring was only $400, which made buying me- ahem- slightly more expensive ring fun. And you know what? we love both rings the same....visit the website http://www.duoconcepts.net/

Here's the thing about Art-One. They have good art, but  horrible customer service. I last stopped in there when I was on my way (and early) to a job interview at Lisa Sette Gallery. I was excited because Jon Read, an artist I knew of from Mesa- has items in the window. I spent a while looking at them, and then went in to see what they were names and how much they were. The two guys dressed in black continued to talk, didn't acknowledge me, and seemed to be annoyed. What a horrible impression.

This place is kind of a great find, good service, great food. The downside....when we went there was no water in the outdoor "river" and there was a long wait on a Friday night- so we sat in the bar. But i guess that's a good sign...

This is a great place to bring out of towners who think Phoenix is a hubble of sand. The patio is wonderful, the food is terrific, and the staff is helpful and not too "in your face fancy." Also- the wine list it to die for. Thanks for always making us have a good time, Lon's. You're a Phoenix, okay PV classic.

Four stars because: parking is a bitch and they seemingly have no airconditioning. This is bad and yest good because you can "walk off" your buzz and because you drink more beer when hot. And they have TWO stalls for the ladies room- which at a bar is just stupid. Four good stars because: atmosphere is great. The beer battered chicken is cheap and awesome, plus, they serve vinegar with their fries! Also- the Raj beer is amazing. This was great to take our friends on Friday, in the summer, after work, because it was crowded!!!! Yay for a place in Tempe in the summer which is crowded.

Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! We typically go here for dinner or for Sunday brunch...where caviar, champagne, sauce, waiters in tuxs, and dessert are all normal fare. Louis is a prince of a man and I've head hes trying to sell the building, so enjoy this classic place while you can. Not sure how long he can keep on keepn' on. His makes the melba toast himself and the good is to die for. This is a must visit place!!!!

The food here is good, but last time we went it was 8:55pm on a friday night and the host looked at us like we grew another head when we wanted to be seated for dinner. He basically chased us out of the restaurant. SERIOUSLY! Another place where service breaks it for me, and so I won't go there anymore.

Okay, the staff here is so entertaining, they have great sake and drinks, and live cheesy piano music. plus, the food comes out in like 2 mins. All of this is perfect when people arrive in from the airport on eastern time and they need a fun place with quick service. YAY! It helps that they are right down the street from us and have every kinda chicken you'd like to eat. In addition is also fun to go to the Ranch Market, or stroll in the garden.

Friday night and this place was ...not packed? If anything its the nill to little ambiance that this place has that kills it for me. The food was great and the service was pretty good, but the decor, the lighting, all a little to lunchroom-like for me.

So  I was little freaked out when I turned up this morning to find talk radio and Sheriff Joe, doing something to do with a book? and the flag? confusing. Anyhow I got the chair I wanted for my husband (zero gravity chair) which was STILL in stock 2 days after Thanksgiving. (and still on sale) After a few minutes of being ignored and I looked confused, someone did help me. The downer was they they don't sell any of their bison or elk meet in a refrigerated or frozen form (to-go) and they didn't have any large stainless steel water bottles or lip balm which attached to your key chain, which are two things I was looking for and thought they'd have there. They also didn't have a place where I could pull the car around to load up the chair, so  instead I hauled it out to the parking lot. It wasn't too heavy, so all's well that ends well.

This place is consistent and one of the only chain restaurants I'm willing to visit.  Last I went my friend and I ordered the same thing, so they brought us out something different to try. On the whole the place is a little on the pricy side....but a nice way to grab something to eat before or after a movie.

The only bad thing here, the acoustics...and waiting for a table even though we made reservations a week ahead of time for my birthday. (Waiting when you have a reservation and then having he staff expect you to spend money at the bar is just a pet peeve of mine) The food isn't overly fancy. Its just very fresh, made well with great ingredients. The scotch beef was fab as was the chocolate cake. The service was decent even though they were busy. It was hard because the tables are so close to each other, but it worked out ok. Def worth a try, but I would warn them that there are a few things they could work on, food isn't one of them. The portions are perfect and everything is cooked perfectly. AND my mom is a chef and she was with us and agreed:)

This is a restaurant which can't decide if its a bar or a restaurant. The food was very good, but not worth the price. The menu is limited and we sat as a table where the bench on one side was backless. I don't know what person wants to pay $30+ per person and not be able to lean back during dinner. The drinks are pricey and not terrible strong or large. :( The valet only thing is redic, as one yelper put it "We're not in Paradise Valley, people. Look to your right. Your evening's backdrop is a busy six lane street-cum-drag strip and Castle Boutique."  The potato app our friends ordered was so/so. The best thing i tried was the stew, which also happens to be the cheapest thing  on the menu at $12. Drinks are $9-11.  Service was decent and the staff friendly. They brought my friend the wrong wine and caught it before she took a sip. I would give 2.5 stars but I feel like they're not sure if they want to be postino's, tuck stop or fez. All 3 places are better. I think I'll come back and just look cool at the bar for $20. If they expanded the menu I may reconsider. Over all: not bad, not great. Fun to try a new spot though.

This place is a little pricey- but you get what you pay for. Johanna's flow class is great. The only con I have is that classes can be packed, they don't offer tons of early morning classes- but this is the best place in the valley, by far, for yoga.

Have to say it, postinos still has the best food of any of the owner's restaurants. Drinks=great Desert=good food=not so good, expensive, very little of it on the plate...and my mom's a chef, so you think I would like that. People watching at Chelsea's kitchen is better. Hope the bulldoze this place to make more parking.

Ok, so I WAS going to give this place 4 stars, maybe even 5, but after having a great b-fast there last week I thought I would take all of my family who is in town this week, to b-fast there this Sunday. When I called to make reservations for 8 people, I was told they don't take reservations on the weekends, As if, you would need them any other time. So I kindly told the guy on the phone, well- you're loosing my business. He, of course, had no reponse. He is the same guy who wonders why at 30 hes working at a restaurant.  and i seriously don't want to hear THIS local business WHINE about the bad economy making them close. I will tell them to SHUT UP  b/c they just turned down 8 people who drink a ton of alcohol and give good tips.  I can guarantee they'll whine anyway, and then close, and then wonder what happened. Everyone will be shocked but me. It might not be this year, but trust me with that kind of customer service--people will go elsewhere.

I LOVE the shelac pedicure! I'm sort of annoyed because no matter how often I SPELL my LAST NAME for the girl, she still gets is wrong, which is annoying when your'e a regular. But that aside the service is quick and everyone is pretty friendly. I wish they had longer hours though and maybe more chairs.

I have to say the food is gross, but the concerts are fun, and the beer in the concert venue is cheaper than on the grounds, but either way- no beer for me. We went on the ferris wheel which only suceeded in scaring me. This fair gets 4 stars for the free on street parking, some guy who gave us free tickets to get in, and for inspiring my fiance to adopt a chicken. Yup. You heard it here first- we're officially urban poultry keepers. Its a hen actually. I'm from the midwest, were County fairs and the Quarter Horse Congress are more my speed. I will say a big thanks for the little 4-H ers who do a great job!

Ths food here is pretty good, prices are not bad. However they REALLY need to have fans on the ourdoor patio. We had no choice but to sit outside this past trip and while it was cool in the shade of the tree in the parking lot where we waited, the outdoor patio covering is metal with no slots for heat to escape. It was like an oven. Outdoor temp was probably 95 degrees, but under this "shade" patio it was more like 125! Even the host commented on how hot it was under there! For the prices and service you're better off at La Grande Orange.

This place has a complex about what ethnicity is it. Plaid skirts are Scottish, food from the U.K. only includes Northern Ireland, and the boxty this place served me came in a potato tortilla. Really. just like at the Old Town Tortilla Factory. For the record, boxty isn't entirely irish. In fact with the exception of a burger and mash potatoes, nothing on this menu would appear on a menu in ireland, not even at the airport.  and even if boxty was a reguarly served food there, its always done poperly by shredding potatoes. Thats in fact the only part of the dish that makes it the dish. That aside, even what what in our "boxty" was gross. I didn't expect a lot, but this place dissapoints.

Ok so I'll begin with the bad, cause baby- they ain't much good..... the drinks were not as strong as they should be for $14,(I had 3 of them and was not even buzzing- usually 2 and I ready to rumble) the sushi is great, but again you end up with $20 of it perperson just to have a decent sized dinner and the waitress totally but things on our bill that we didn't order AND the "5 piece" tempura order originally came w 3 pieces. All of this and the 5 oz of  so-so sake was $15. They should be ad they are new to the valley b/c in this  market they'll be a one-off place to go for people who can vacation. Plus this was all on my birthday, so they needed to do better. Plus you pay $8 for valet and they didn,t even pull the car around all the way. Eahhhhhh "at the the sushi was good?" Is not how I wanted to feel when the bill is over $120.

I like the scene, the atmosphere, location, drinks, food, service etc. The prices are little on the high side for what you get portion wise. My husband is 6' tall with a 33" waist and they didn't give him enough food. Hate to see what happens when the power protein gym rats go there. One thing I don't like is the sort of "club" feel here. Its nice they want to be sexy, but Scottsdale has a lot of sex, sometimes you just want substance. Last time we were there, we went for my mother's birthday. She is a pretty hot 60+ lady, but the waitress was sort of busting out of her bra (which was busting out of her shirt) A little too much for my taste, keep it classy- we're not in Vegas. AND you're a restaurant connected to a church. It sort of ruins the quasi romantic atmosphere. I also think the seating is a bit cramped for dinner seating, this isn't Pei Wei folks. BUT if you haven't been, give it a try, its  definitely a great spot for all the GOOD reasons I've listed above.

Although the stuff is pricey I LOVE lululemon. Its definitely stuff that you can wear even when you're not at the gym. I picked up a great jacket which is great for early AZ morning trips to the gym. And I won't feel bad putting it on after yoga! Perfect for the active girly girl, so fellas, stop in and get something for your lady. I think some of the stuff runs a bit small, but no surprise since its an upper end store for fit people:)

We went to jump street with some friends after a brunch to celebrate my birthday! We went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't that crowded and we had a blast. What a workout! We figured out how to do flips and other tricks by watching others. I will say that it was a bit weird that they don't have more lockers etc to lock items up and the carpet and food set up is a little dated. You also can't bring you're own water which is  a shame because you'll NEED it if you jump a lot.

After reading Gabi's reviews, I'm convinces she needs to give it another try. While not the perfect place, the service was attentive and all of us enjoyed out unique dishes. The portions were large, (with the exception of the meat dishes, which were HUGE) but not crazy. Enough for a little doggie back. We were celebrating my birthday and all of us ordered dessert.....the mushroom bread pudding was once of the best things I've ever had!  I will say that our dinner took about an hour to come out, which is redic. o 3.5 starts.

This was SUCH a great place to begin looking for dresses. Linda was wonderful and very good at getting my larger than floor sized self into all these great dresses. Although they are known for more expensive dresses ($5,000+), the one I really liked was only about $3000. They make you feel great, and understood what I was looking for.
