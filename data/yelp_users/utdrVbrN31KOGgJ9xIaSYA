Best sushi in AZ. For real. Only downside is I stink like tempura when I leave. Really poor ventilation.

Best kitty vet I have ever been to... and that is a long list.  Dr B and staff are faaannnntastic.  They are always available - and when one of my cats had surgery the vet gave me her cell phone number in case there were complications and I needed to get a hold of her. My cat is also very nervous but when Dr. B walks in the room and pets her she immediately relaxes. Only 4 stars because the cost  of procedures seem higher than other vets.

I love Pita Jungle- the food is great. The 2 stars is for this location. The service is horrible. I am a very patient person so for me to actually walk away from the counter in a quiet rage was unusual. Rude, rude, rude. It won't keep me away from other PJ's- just this location.

Quick service, good food, great price and friendly staff. Always plenty of seating - a great place for work lunch groups.

Delicious, but go for dinner- lunch menu is limited.

YOU MUST GO HERE. IMMEDIATELY. Only complaint is long waiting time- but that's because this place rocks. Try the popcorn. And be prepared to spend at least 10 minutes deciding on a cocktail- the menu is extensive.
