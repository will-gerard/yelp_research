"No Vegans Allowed", reads a sign posted just above the entrance and narrated by a middle aged man in slow motion usually working for charlie brown. Okay, maybe not, but it should be there. The only thing truly vegan on the menu is the guacamole, so they claim. The pastas all have cheese, even just red sauce pasta (they cook the cheese into the sauce), my sources reveal. The only reason I find myself at Oregano's is if one of my friends is getting a melted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it, which, to be honest, looks delicious.

If it was not for the convenient location next to a movie theater, I would surely never eat here. However, since it is the only place serving food at an affordable price for a teenager at the location, you get to hear about their sodium filled sauces, above mediocre service, and bland taste. I have had just about everything vegan on their menu. The rice and lentils are bland and tasteless, their potatoes are drenched in a sodium barbecue-esque sauce, and their veggie burgers are overpriced, too large, and not very tasty.  The service is usually alright with an occasional good experience.  At happy hour their tapas are usually a good deal, and go nicely with their $2 Margaritas. I recommend them.  Otherwise, get in the car after a movie and go somewhere nice.

This hidden gem is located just outside of Mill Ave and is apparently the hipster home base of Tempe. If somehow you are allowed in without suspenders or nonprescription clear glasses, you will see exactly what goes on. to the left at least four people playing chess, to the right someone reading a book, but sitting next to someone writing a book, and did someone just walk in with a puppy? Yes. As you walk up to the counter you are already disoriented so you may be confused about what to order. Well, they are known for their cappuccinos, which I can personally vouch for but on a hot summer day in Arizona, I recommend their "Dirty Horchata" or "Espresso Excellente" a rice milk horchata with shots of espresso. It was good for the minute it lasted. See you there next time.

The staff is friendly, the service is fast and the food is magnificent.  As soon as I get in im asked about my day, typical but important. I have been to dlish many times but usually to the one in Scottsdale.  This one feels cleaner and gives off a better vibe. The staff all get along and joke around with each other. I love that. Food made with love. I usually order the early bird style burger, the one with the egg on it. I don't eat dairy so without the cheese I was disappointed. The burger is rather dry, but what can you expect when the "meat of it" *giggles, is made of a composition of quinoa and black beans? This past visit I ordered the house style burger. Good choice. It was delicious and I felt good after I ate it. Usually when I order its either one or the other. I will be a student at ASU next year and living in Tempe. I like everything about this place so much that I think I will even put in an appplication for a job here. no joke! To students who are health conscious, environmentally aware, and most commonly, on a budget, THIS is the place for you.  See you there!

Vegan cafe with great soy parfaits? CHECK I Will be a freshmen at ASU next year and have been mapping out my common food destinations. This is one of them! I walked in to order today with my lovely girlfriend and had the most pleasant dinning experience. I was welcomed by friendly staff and healthy options. I opted for the wrap for $8.50. Definitely a good choice. I did so because I saw a ready burrito there and it looked scrumptious.  I was given some very distressing information.  "Im sorry but we are out of Mexican rice", said the man at the counter. My heart sank. This was it. Its all over. We should of settled for the place downtown! But wait, a light shines. "Why don't you just tell me what you want in it and ill make it for you in the wrap?" There is a God after all! and he is hiding in my completed wrap of purple pepper, basil, Orzo mixed with coconut lentil soup and fresh green vegetables. This went so well with the alternating bites of my girlfriends delicious soy parfait (3.50) with homemade granola sweetened with honey and fresh fruit.  Top it off with one of their amazing home made brownies and you've got yourself the right way to start your day.
