This review is for their conference room and attending an event here, I've never stayed at this Marriott.  I've been to two PPT presentations here, and the food has been awful both times.   It was a breeze for parking and the location is ideal, but when the food is flavorless, over-cooked, and tastes worse than airplane food, I would not recommend any company host their events here

Came for a work event at the Rendezvous Room so I'm already happy since I don't have to take expense into consideration.   We were served a 3 course meal during an educational powerpoint presentation.  They also had a great spread of cheeses, salami, and wine while guests arrived.  I really liked the salami, and any time you can demonstrate great seasoning with dried meats, I'm all for it.   By the time the food started, it was already ~8pm, so I devoured that first salad course. Coming from someone whose yelp tagline is "what are these strange things you call vegetables," I think that's a supreme compliment. Nothing tasted raw (which is usually why I dislike veggies), and the sugared pecans really complemented the course well.   The entree is where I took a star off. I expected deliciousness from the filet, but it was just average.   Dessert was delectable though, as they served up a peach tart that blew me away.  I would go back for that in a heartbeat, and it didn't feel heavy at all even after eating for ~2 hours

4 stars alone for their relationship (I believe it's across all Basha's) to sell Caribou Coffee.   Yay for this (former) Illinoisan coffee-addict (current)

I came on a weekday afternoon, and there was only 1 other table taken.   Unfortunately, I was ignored for a good few minutes trying to order and I guess the workers there were "busy" counting down the time until their shift was over.  This sounds exactly like the experience Mike had (review: 2/6/14), so at least it's not just me. I asked about their punch card, and the staff sounded very annoyed that I was taking up so much of their time.   They have a huge amount of outdoor patio space along with couches inside, and thanks to the useful wifi tip (pw is their phone number!), I got a lot of work done here.   Their Mexico Mocha wasn't anything to write home about, and newspapers were on the ground everywhere while the workers only came out to clean up ONCE...right before closing...doing who knows what because they were certainly not that busy.

There's no way you can go wrong with a GIGANTIC bowl of pho after a rough night out. So, go extra large or go home.  That magical mixture of salt/msg, soup, and meat just tells your hangover to 'shut the fuck up.'  I feel like I'm stealing food at their prices, so I'm coming back no matter what.   Sadly though, the service was horrendous as it took 25 minutes for 2 bowls of pho to come out. And they got our appetizer order wrong.  But yeah, brb next weekend.

I came on a weekday craving some wings.  I left with probably elevated cholesterol and higher blood pressure.   The problem is that the wings are definitely miniaturized. For the price that I paid, I guess that's to be expected. However, it threw off the balance of the wings as they were much too salty for my taste. Think licking mini cubes of salt...  I ordered the Danny's Special, so there were both wings and fries.  I did really dig the cajun spice on the fries, but not enough to warrant another visit  P.S. $10 min on credit/debit card

Extremely attentive and genuinely a good person.   Dr. Sullivan will listen to all your ailments and figure out a way to treat them. Considering how much health care is changing, I never felt rushed during my exam and he truly cares about your overall health.   Highly recommended

Every time I go into Trader Joe's, I think to myself "Why don't I come here more often?" Oh right...it's because I always leave with multiple bags (and my one recyclable tote is never big enough...) and go home with way too many snacks and food.   I guess I'm just not a great grocery shopper because I tend to make numerous circles and pick up more and more items.   It's not my fault when I spend most of my working day thinking about food and they have so many adventurous and tempting options. There's almost always something that is being sampled and I also love how new items are always introduced depending on how well they sell in the area!

Ehhhh.  Was it a good steak? Sure. A little better than 'okay' Was it the best steak I've ever had? Not even close.   Considering the price, ambience, and how well known the name is, I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience.

Located in a prime location in Las Vegas, we were surprised that the food was decently priced.  Since we had a big group, we were seated away from the water fountains, but the decor inside the restaurant was pretty pleasing to the eyes anyway.   Tried the pork tenderloins due to the strong recommendations here, and I was not disappointed. The meat was juicy and perfectly cooked. The portion was also sizable enough for a full night of partying.  The complimentary bread came with two different olive spreads, and turned me into a fan of olives.  -1 star for the awkward music playing. For the duration of our meal, there was some trance song, and it definitely didn't fit the mood of a fancy meal.

Oh Chelsea, I think I'm in love.   From the impeccable service to the divine food, what a great place to have Sunday brunch!  It started off with the complimentary sea-salt chocolate chip cookie, and continued with the fresh french press coffee and Chelsea's eggs benedict.  They pressed the coffee right on the table, and the aroma of grounds made the visit that much more memorable.  We also ordered a pitcher of sangria to share, and would highly recommend it. Hey, it's 5oclock somewhere.   To top it off, our server took the extra time to split our checks individually.  Our waters were always full and she came out of nowhere with ninja-like speed to refill our sangrias as well.   The restaurant offers great patio seating, and plays relaxing music to accompany you on your meal. I felt like I was transported to a tropical paradise....

I'm now very conflicted with this establishment.   The original location is SO MUCH BETTER. The employees there take the time out to explain their fusion menu, they give you tastings of entrees, and made me fall in love with Chino Bandido.   I do, however, work much closer to this location, and I was so excited to make the trek here to emulate that first experience.   Sadly, every time I come here, I feel like I'm collecting a debt when I'm placing an order with this location's employees. I guess nobody likes working here... I love their food, as you can see I've checked in here a few times.   But enough's enough:  -Finding the place still takes quite a bit of effort at night -The ambience is awful, the storefront is having an identity crisis while trying to be a hip sports bar with the TVs and San Tan brews, but fails to deliver good food instead -They're always out of Egg Foo Yung...the one time they had it, it tasted completely bland and nothing like the one I ordered from the original location -They've gotten my order wrong. When I'm only placing two bowl orders and the place is not remotely busy, there's no excuse  Maybe I need to find the manager/owners and have a heart to heart talk. Either these are two different franchisees or they need to shape up this location

Fell in love with the flavors and delicious turkey after ordering the famous  turkey sandwich with avocado, bacon and balsamic onions.  It's definitely more expensive than the typical sandwich place, but I think the well-balanced flavors of the sandwich that I did try was amazing and worth it (not sure about the other sandwiches though).

Most of these reviews are just complaining about Cox's service, which I will agree...it is way overpriced for what they offer.  What I'm reviewing is the efficiency of their employees and an actual visit to this brick & mortar store.   I came in to return my borrowed router and forgot my bill...I also didn't make an appointment.  No problem, the employee was able to look up my account and finished the whole process within a minute.  So, feel free to return your equipment here!

I come to Asiana when I'm in a time crunch or if I'm already in the plaza for Hodori or The Street.   The selection is OK but the prices are not very friendly. Sales are rare and usually not for anything I ever want, but at least their snack aisle is on point

This restaurant is definitely better than its 3.5 star rating! The decor is a little run down, but the food here is authentic and very flavorful.  Instead of driving a lot further south to mesa, this place offers some great food.  I would consider it a little pricier than your typical Chinese take out place (especially if you compare to Asian Cafe Express in Mesa), but it also operates as a higher end seafood restaurant and not the place you go for orange/kung pao chicken.  Try it out, and I would recommend ordering the roast duck  I have it at 4.5 stars right now, but would happily bump it to a 5 if I see consistency when I go back

Love this place! But so does everybody and their mothers.  To be a take-out l33t: call ahead to place an order, otherwise you're gonna have to wait because the restaurant is always packed.  Make sure to order off the Hong Kong Style Menu.  It's 10 pages long, so if you're indecisive, just close your eyes and point to something. It'll probably be good.  No surprise it's always busy here, as they're practically giving the food away at those price points.

If you found this place in Southern California, it would probably sit idly like every Lollicup, Quickly, or TapEx.   I miss the sea salt coffee from 85 Degrees.  I miss the amazing fruit-in-your-drink selection from Tastea.  I miss the self-pour tea from Ten Ren's Tea Station.  I miss the honey boba from Half & Half.   If you're craving innovative drinks, you won't find it here. But at least this place suffices for the most basic boba milk tea until I get to go home again

Sigh, I had really high expectations coming into this place.  Korean bbq is one of my favorite dinner adventures and I've been spoiled growing up close to Koreatown in Los Angeles.   The banchans are adequate, nothing spectacular but they definitely calibrated and increased the prices of their entrees so take advantage of the refills.   You don't get to grill your own meats, which eliminates half the fun of the KBBQ experience.   We ordered a galbi, bulgogi, and kimchi tofu soup. The bulgogi was missing the sweet marinated flavor that I was looking for, and although the meat was tender, it was a bit over-cooked. The galbi was a lot better in comparison, but again, nothing special. The tofu soup was probably the best part of the meal, but not even as good as BCD. It's an Asian restaurant, so the service will be lacking...but really I'm disappointed in making such a far trek and don't see myself coming back

Love this place!  If you've ever walked around the streets of Mexico, you've seen the fruit stands that serve fresh squeezed juices and chile-peppered fruits.  This is as authentic of that experience as you can get, except it's a brick & mortar store.   My mango smoothie was absolutely delicious, and taste so much more natural than anything from jamba juice.   Come here before/after/to accompany a hearty meal from chino bandido

Unspectacular.   The service was extremely slow considering I was the only customer in the afternoon and all I ordered was a burrito.  The place itself is pretty filthy, and the construction around the entire area makes it even tougher to get here.   I would have to be pretty drunk the next time I come in

Finally had a chance to check out their Ramen night this past Tuesday.  I couldn't find the restaurant and their parking structure for the life of me. After making circles for 10 minutes, I ended up parking at Roaring Fork and walked over to the restaurant.  Thankfully this wasn't a first date situation, but I would imagine that wouldn't make the best first impression. Also would've sucked if my car had been towed (even if that seemed very unlikely) as I didn't eat at Roaring Fork.  Anyways, I really like how affordable their ramen menu is compared to their regular prix fixe one. We even had the honor of being walked to our table by chef Josh.   To the food- we shared the okonomiyaki and watched the sous chefs/line cooks prepare each one to perfection. It was delicious and there were plenty for sharing between the three of us.  The shoyu ramen was delicious and I'm glad our server discussed all the different options between the sakes and ramen. The onsen egg was well worth the add-on and added a creamier texture to the ramen.  I feel like this ramen is much more Americanized than Cherry Blossom/downtown tokyo in LA/places in NYC, but it was still a scrumptious meal well worth the money.

Let's get the negative out of the way- it's not the cleanest place in the world. When the only two employees are the husband & wife team, they're often too busy to clear out the tables.   With that said, their pho is consistent and they don't skimp on the servings. On a cold wintery day, there's nothing better than a nice large bowl of pho. It's still my favorite hangover cure.  The price point is great for the amount of bean sprouts and meat with your meal.  You'll see an eclectic lunch crowd here- from the Banner Health workers to Mesa Community College students, this is a local gem hidden in plain sight.

What a pleasant and enjoyable experience!  Whoever is doing the hiring/training for this branch deserves some serious praise as I continue to read excellent reviews on their service.   I stopped by after a long hike at Tom's Thumb, and it was my first time here. Had a very pleasant conversation with the worker there and after she found out it was my first time there, she hooked me up with 9 extra stamps for their drink card...that is AWESOME.   The iced coffee definitely rejuvenated me and gave me a great start to a productive day. They also made the drink so fast I didn't even have time to type in my next destination on the gps...amazing!

Great innovative flavors, awesome yelp checkin deal, and lots of parking spaces to boot. They offer plenty of mini tasting cups so you can create your own masterpiece.  As I was leaving, I was practically pitching their sour applehead flavor to a customer when she looked skeptical while talking to the person behind the counter. I hope that flavor stays!

Amazing how they can make me look forward to a dental visit!  Awesome and very friendly staff, state of the art equipment, and a doctor who will block off time so he can do a perfect job.   Can't imagine going anywhere else now...  Edit: I now live 40 minutes away and come back happily for my dental care.

(+)s: Hidden in a random plaza, staff that only speaks Chinese, a view into the kitchen where you can watch the hand pulled noodles being prepared. Great prices for authentic chinese food.   I've only been here once but the spicy noodles here are scrumptious.  If I come back the next time and the food is still consistently delicious, this will definitely become a 5 star review

Their rating is way too high.  Not sure how 1.5 stars is too high? Read on...  I came in since I was moving nearby and needed some furniture, and worked with a friendly and helpful salesman (thanks, Jeremiah). I feel the exact opposite about their scummy manager though, as he berated me for not purchasing a mattress because I didn't find anything I like there. I guess a $1000 purchase is not enough to tame his condescending and unpleasant attitude. After I decided to purchase a dining set and a sofa, I asked when the delivery would be. Since they charge a $100 fee, I expected them to actually fulfill it properly. (One week quote, which I was fine with)  I called in the morning the day of the delivery, and they said everything is ready. So I wait. And wait. And wait some more.  Around 7 pm, I call again to see what's going on. No one picked up at the warehouse, so I called the store that I purchased from. Apparently they must get these calls often because two times, someone "answered" but didn't say anything on the line. After finally reaching an actual person, they said their warehouse is closed and they'll contact me first thing tomorrow morning. Okay, fine. I'm ready to go outside for dinner after an entire day being confined to my apartment. Nooooo, the saleswoman says, sometimes the delivery comes as late as 9 pm, so I must continue my 'white collar prison treatment.'  Next day comes and surprise, surprise...no phone call until I once again take the initiative to find out where my furniture is.  2 wasted work days off later, I finally have my furniture set up.  At this point, I have no idea how BBB hasn't shut them down yet. No savings is worth the wasted time unless you enjoy acting like a debt collector just to get your furniture

This place makes exceptional coffee!  Love their chemex method and wide selection of darker roasts that really pack a punch to start your day.   It's much too pricey as an everyday option, and pretty tough to find parking that's close by. Since they make their coffees individually, you also have to expect a bit of a wait before your coffee's ready. So stop by here before a long day of shopping, but don't come here if you're trying to be on time for work.  Or you should come here. The weather's way too nice for you to be stuck indoors!

This is now my favorite/go-to restaurant when I have guests from out of town.  It's a great spot for adventurous eaters, but at the same time...the flavors are still very familiar as you can easily order BBQ platters if you're bringing hesitant guests.    I've been here thrice now, and everything I have tasted has been phenomenal! Just like a true hidden gem, it's a little difficult to find their private parking lot.  It's a mom & pop type of space with some very friendly owners.   I highly recommend getting some freshly prepared egg rolls (ended up ordering it twice on the first visit because they were so scrumptious) and a honeydew boba.  You can't go wrong with the loat cha (rice noodles with beef) or the kebobs, but I've also had the intestine-filled pho, and you can't beat that fully flavored and deep broth!  Be patient when it comes to your food coming out, since they have a pretty small kitchen...but get ready for a flavor explosion.   Now they just need to update their website with a menu.

Even though it was quite a trek for us to get here, after reading about this restaurant's soup dumplings in '100 Favorite Dishes of 2015' in the New Times, I was very much excited to try them. I have tasted authentic and absolutely delicious versions in LA and Chicago, so I couldn't wait to see if this locale would deliver against such a tough premise.   The xiaolongbaos were absolutely as good as advertised! The 8 little pieces of heaven came out piping hot and the consistency was perfect for scooping up with a spoon (chopsticks if you're feeling brave). That moment when the dumpling breaks open in your mouth and the soup explodes amongst your tastebuds.....................sorry, I had to clean off some drool from my keyboard.   The 80% score comes from their not-so scrumptious complimentary soup (but hey, it was free) and the lackluster spicy garlic eggplant dish. Yes, it's not the type of cuisine they specialize in, but the dish really lacked seasoning. After such a stellar appetizer, the meal just fell flat.  No doubt I'll be back for more xlbs though!

I was afraid it would be tough to find a good salon after moving from LA, but they know exactly what they're doing here with asian hair. The wait is usually longer than other places, but that's because they really spend time personalizing each cut.  Call ahead to make an appointment, they'll honor it instead of taking other walk-ins.   Best part is Men's cut remains $12. Christine is a rock star

Disclaimer:  I did not sign my membership contract at this location, so I didn't have to deal with the owner of the gym...which isn't a knock on management, I just can't confirm/deny that one star review.   With that said, I usually come to this gym after 9 PM, and it is ABSOLUTELY EMPTY.  Everything is always kept really clean and all the equipment are top-of-the line and new.  Compared to other Anytimes, I am not badgered by personal trainers trying to persuade me for training, and that's also a huge plus as well.   I do, however, hate their layout for free weights. The area is not big enough for more than 2 people there (which is why I started going after 9), and gym etiquette is lacking also as some members have taken my bench even if I leave my towel on top.

I'm still on the fence between 4/5 stars for this car wash.  I really like the free clip-on air freshener and the self-service vacuum are still new enough that it offers plenty of suction.  They advertise that their car wash is the only one in Arizona that is green-friendly, but I'm not exactly sure how they accomplish this...so I'll take their word for it.   They have 6 staff members hand scrubbing your car throughout the wash, but I feel like a lazy douchebag when they're doing all the work while I sip my coffee. There are usually spots that they've missed, but for $1/staff member, it's certainly worth the money

Stopped by here on St. Patrick's Day weekend to cap off the night with a last drink.   Our server made a couple suggestions on their drink selection, since it was clear we were newbies in German craft biers.   We tried two new craft brews and I really liked mine. However, my friend went with a red ale, and unbeknownst to him, it turned out to be a Sour.   When our server came and asked us how we were doing, he remarked to him that he didn't like how tart his beer was. Our server took the beer away and gave us another selection on the house. What I really appreciated is that he ended up complimenting the more expensive beer and charged us the lower amount. Kudos to him for such a great gesture.   Minus one star because we had to chase down our server to order in the beginning when it really wasn't very busy...but I think they were trying to shut everything down for closing.

The setting: Saturday night, post-hearty meal from Hana, and ready to catch a show across the street.   Feeling awesome, alive, and invincible (cue Taylor's 22)...let's go treat ourselves to dessert!  I take my spoon and scoop up the frozen yogurt.  My face flinches...something was rotten in the state of Denmark.   It tasted really tart. Sour. Like crinkle your nose sour. Not the regular tart that froyo has (and I've had many many yogurts in my day living in Los Angeles, Westwood, and Chicago), but the 'this has gone bad after too many days of non-refrigeration' tart. Like sour milk, tart.   I had my friends taste it, and they agreed that it was NOT a normal tartness.  Had to throw the treat away, such a shame...  But everything will be alright, if we just keep dancing like we're...22

Strike 1 - Being out of the 'jug-o'coffee'/pitcher of iced coffee, I had to order 3 separate coffees for my group and it was definitely pricier. I was expecting the server to offer a comparable price for the 3 coffees since the restaurant made an excuse about the "pitchers not being delivered" but I guess my expectations were too high. This left a bitter taste in my mouth (not in the good coffee way), and there's also no refill. Since I run on caffeine, there just wasn't enough there to wake me up.   Strike 2 - I ordered the blackstone scramble, and the eggs tasted absolutely bland. I'm always looking for a kick in my breakfast to help me wake up (sensing a theme here?)...it just didn't hit that note for me despite the delicious description on the menu.  I should not need to drown my food in tabasco for flavor.   Strike 3 - I can see the ordering system working to improve efficiency, but in this case, since there were no designated waiters, there was no motivation to assist/clean tables. I didn't see many patrons leaving tip, and this just creates a no win situation on both sides.  And I'm out

It's not a big secret that this place rocks. There's almost always a line when I stop by, but their service is extremely speedy so it'll only be 5 minutes before they finish making your delicious food for you hungry carnivores reading this.   A stand-alone location that serves up some delicious tacos y burritos y gorditas, Im definitely addicted to their endless salsa bar.  The guacamole is a miss, but can't really complain when it's free.   Their free chips & salsa for checking in makes it a 5 star place.

Wow, I'm baffled at how NOT helpful their staff is.   I just purchased an HDTV, and figured it would be safer (albeit a little more expensive) to deal with direct handling at a brick & mortar store instead of possible online shipping damages.   There are plenty of staff members walking around checking their phones, but don't ask them for help with carrying your items because they'll find an excuse to run away.  After lugging the 50+ pound TV by myself onto the cart, I rolled it into the parking lot, only to find that it wouldn't fit into my compact car.   I went back in to see if any of the staff members had any ideas on how to carry this TV home, and all they suggested was "go get a bigger car."  Wow, thanks Sherlock. Let me just go fly my G6 onto your loading dock.   I proceed to ask about their "free delivery" option that I saw online (proof: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/55-class-54-5-8-diag--led-1080p-120hz-smart-hdtv/8816483.p?id=1218901344739&skuId=8816483&st=samsung%2055%22%20hdtv&cp=1&lp=1#tab=overview),  Darien said "no, we charge for delivery."  Mind you, I have an HDTV unsupervised in a parking lot so I'm not looking to linger. I don't have time to argue with your ignorance and I'm beyond frustrated at this point.  As a last resort, I ask if they have any supplies that I can use to rig the tv onto the top of my car?  "no, we don't want to be held liable."  I ended up taking the TV out of the box (say goodbye to returns) but fortunately it worked out.  F YOU best buy, but THANK YOU to all the kind Scottsdale strangers who helped me carry the TV into my car and making helpful suggestions.  Never going back to BB for the rest of my life.

De-licious!  Their straight forward menu and very friendly service has me smiling and looking forward to my next visit.  Kudos for their bright and large signage since it made it a lot easier to find.   While looking at their menu, the workers there offered water and made sure I understood what I was ordering.  I really liked their fries and the Standard also packed great flavors. Remember when Carl's Jr. tried to advertise "gourmet burgers at a fast-food price?" The Stand has this idea executed perfectly.   It is a bit pricey for everyday lunch, especially with a shake, but it'll be hard for me to drive this place by without making a stop.

I didn't do my research before coming here, and decided to order my standard taro smoothie with boba.   Sadly, there were chunks of taro powder on the bottom and I had to throw out half the drink because it was disgusting.  The boba had the right consistency though, so I probably should've chosen just a regular tea with boba.  After reading all the reviews, I'll only come back for the shaved snow and not any of the drinks  Edit: The Street, on the other hand, delivered a flawless taro smoothie with boba

ARGH, WHY DO I KEEP COMING HERE?  This is my third time buying a drink.  I thought to myself "maybe I've been getting things that are too difficult to make, I should just get the boba milk tea."  WRONG. I had to spit out the icy, tasteless, pretty much vomit-inducing drink. I wish I spent the $4 on water instead. To tally up the three visits: 2/3 drinks I spit out. 3/3 drinks I threw away without finishing half of it.  I need to keep this review here so I stop myself from coming. Damn its convenient proximity to the heaven that is Asian Cafe Express

Ahh, a great find with this mom & pop restaurant inside a strip mall!  I got the doner kebab plate to go, and really liked the dill rice that came with the entree.  I practically lived off doner kebabs while studying abroad in Europe, so it's hard to live up to those expectations.  The lentil soup was a little too salty, but went great with the rice as long as you're not eating it by itself.   I say skip the regular fast food fare if you're here for a movie, and try out something different (probably preaching to the choir though, fellow yelpers).  For $11, the portion was great as well, since it served as both dinner and lunch the next day.   Save your receipt for 10% off on your next order!

Ordered a pho to-go, and they had everything packaged to perfection!  The steak was still a little rare, but luckily the broth was scorching hot so I was able to cook all my side ingredients to emulate the perfect dine-in experience.   The extra mile comes from their pre-packaged sauce: it was a yin-yang combo of hoisin and sriracha. I only wish I lived a little closer to support this small business more frequently!

Unlike most normal people, the smell of stinky tofu actually had me happy and excited to try out their food.   We ordered: house special/chef's best beef noodle soup, xiaolong baos, and pork chop rice.  After growing up in Rowland Heights, I have some pretty high standards with Chinese food and this eatery delivered.   The broth for the soup was really tasty, but unfortunately the meat and noodles didn't absorb the flavor entirely (probably due to the cooking method of just boiling the contents and then dumping them into the soup?).  The xiaolong baos were awesome though...you get the explosion of the soup from the dumplings with your first bite.   Even though the two of us both spoke chinese with the servers, it still didn't get us any better service, so yay, at least they're not racist.  Just don't expect any water refills and you'll leave happy.

After making a 400 mile trip from California, my car was in serious need of a good car wash. One look at my windshield and most entomologists/vegetarians would be gagging at all the splatters. Since I was getting gas anyway, I figured I would give their car wash a try as well.  The prices: $5 for the most basic, $8 for a few windshield add-ons, $12 for wheels and $15 for a deluxe. They also offer a monthly package if you're obsessed with a clean car.  Anyways, just 3 minutes later, my car was very much shinier. It's an auto wash so it wasn't spotless, but great value after I made such a long trip. Highly recommended if you need a quick wash.  They were still offering the $2 off "grand opening" deal...which made it that much sweeter!

Really awesome coffee along with some great staff members and the ideal outdoor patio.   I've tried a few items on the menu and all of them have been stellar.  This place is at the top of my first if I need to get some work done...

I had my phone stolen last weekend, long story short, I was fed up with not having a phone and was completely ready to pay full retail price for a new one.  After entering the store, Michael greeted me with enthusiasm and wanted to do anything to help me out. Unlike a lot of places/customer service reps who just treats you like a dollar sign, he genuinely listened to my story and told me where to go for a possible discount even though he would lose the commission. They didn't have the phone in stock and he was completely honest about it.  Thank you Michael, for going above and beyond in sympathizing with my situation. I'll definitely come back when my contract is due.

To me, customer service is what defines a restaurant. While good food might get you in the door, great service is what keeps me coming back. You want loyal customers, especially if you're trying to build a business.   Right when we walked in the door, we were greeted by a manager/owner asking us if we had been to this eatery before. He offered recommendations along with explaining the concept of the restaurant, and I was immediately impressed.   Everyone working at the place was extra friendly, and a different person (definitely looked like an owner) specifically went out of his way to ask us if we were enjoying our meal.   Like many other reviews have said, they offer healthy options along with great, innovative sauces.   One tip for improvement though, since they're obviously a brand new business, there were too many things to pick (and look at) on the menu. Simplify it to picking a protein and picking a sauce. Otherwise I can only imagine a very hectic line during lunch rush.   I can picture this becoming a HUGE success like Chipotle, and I have no doubts I will be back.

Really satisfying meal with delicious flavors and dishes.   We ordered the seafood gumbo, sausage gumbo, etouffe, jambalaya, and everything was 5-star worthy. Our server was also really attentive and gave us some great recommendations with the New Orleans beers.   I wish they were at a better location, because they deserve to be busier with such great food.   Looking forward to coming back!

I was beyond excited to see a fast food Korean eatery inside a mall food court.  I've always been a bigger fan of Korean bbq in comparison to Japanese teriyaki when it comes to casual/fast food dining.   Sadly, this place charged an arm and a leg for basically 4 pieces of beef/bulgogi. They lay out their salad underneath the meat so they can increase their profit margin.  I understand it's a tough business and they're in Paradise Valley, but I cannot see myself coming back as a customer when I feel cheated on my meal.

I was fairly disappointed with my recent visit.   I came in being extremely excited about trying the Peking Duck empanada, but alas, they had "pulled that particular one out of their rotation."  That makes sense since duck is expensive, but I wish I knew that before coming in.   I ended up with the chicken paella and the bulgogi flavors. I've been to Spain, and I pretty much grew up on korean BBQ. Those did not even remotely remind me of the authentic cuisine I've had before.   Was it a good empanada? Sure. Is it worth the money and the hype? Not even close.  They've also just been sitting under heat lamps all day, and I can't imagine coming back.

This quickly became my favorite Anytime location due to its spacious layout and awesome owners!  I stopped by the other day after work, and the owner greeted me happily as he welcomed me to his gym. You can easily sense that he takes pride in meeting members and making this place feel like your second home.   Everything is brand new here, as they have only been open for a few months.  You can see that they did not spare any expenses since everything you need is in this gym...including a mediation room! They have 2 showers and 2 restrooms, along with plenty of storage space for your bags and a Sparklett water dispenser.  They went with top of the line equipment, and everything is pristinely clean.   Due to my rotating work schedule, I've been to the: Mesa, Chandler, North Scottsdale, Glendale,  and this location.  I have to drive a bit out of my way just to go to this gym, but it's definitely worth it.   Finally, a few pros v.s. other locations: barbell rack (missing in Mesa), numerous benches and space for free weights (lacking at Glendale and Chandler), brightly lit and no dead space (Glendale), TVs are actually on (Mesa).

Update: ~200 check-ins later, it's clear that I'm obsessed with this place.  Definitely my second home...owners remain consistently amazing, and they've brought in a lot more personal trainers and different training equipment.   I'm a little sad the meditation room got taken out (although I never used it myself, but I really liked their 'whole body-mind' concept from Amber), and keeping the place clean is a little tougher since the sanitary wipes stations keep disappearing, but those are very minor quips to a place that I truly treasure.   My work is now 40 minutes away and I think I need to move to a different gym, it's making me sad just thinking about it.  2014 review: this quickly became my favorite Anytime location due to its spacious layout and awesome owners!

Came here because of the pictures of the Kalbi tacos and I've been craving some korean/mexican fusion due to the lack of Kogi trucks in my new state.   Sadly that was only a temporary promotion/special so they weren't available and the food was just OK.  There was a miscommunication with the server with one of the menu items and her recommendation (the soup stew) actually ended up being the best dish we had all night!
