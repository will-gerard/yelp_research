Rob & Darcy have done an amazing job on the remodel and transforming the cafe into more than just bagels and cream cheese. They have really good coffee as well! The staff, for the most part, is friendly and helpful.   Free wi-fi is a plus! :)

Delicious food. Horrible service at this location. Go to the Southern and McClintock location for better service and friendlier staff.

Love the food, friendly staff! Ask for Carlos as your server and you will be well taken care of! :)

If I could give 0 stars, I would.   A group of 7 of us visited the Ray & McClintock location on Friday 4/8 for lunch for a colleagues birthday. We arrived just at noon, and our server greeted us after about 5 minutes of sitting down, and the experience continued to get worse from there.   About 10 minutes after arriving, we finally received our drinks, and that was that. Our server (says Brooke W on our receipts) did not come back to take our order. I had to approach the manager on duty to get someone to take our order, since we only had a short time period of our lunch hour left. When there was no other servers around, he began to mentally take our order, until the bartender came over into the dining room with pen & paper, after over 20 minutes, during this time, a party that arrived after us, same waitress, was served and orders taken in less than ten minutes from their being seated. After the bartender put in our order, we had to ask the manager and bartender for refills on our beverages as we did not see our original waitress until she delivered our tabs, which we also had to ask for.   We are now 40 minutes into our lunch hour, and now do not even have time to enjoy our meals because everything from that point was so rushed, including an order that was incorrect. I had to then walk up to the manager at the food line once again to ask for the corrected order to go and a box for my food. Once the server was finally bringing over our checks, I had asked for a refill on my water before she even collected the tabs to run our cards. After running all of our cards and finished cashing us out, she then asked if I would like a water to-go.   It was the single most frustrating and worst experience we have ever had at any Zipps restaurant that we have had at this location that we have visited numerous times before today. We will definitely have to reconsider before we return to this location in the future.

Great pedicures, get there early on weekends or else you will wait up to an hour. Or go to their other location on 48th and Chandler.

I am not the biggest fan of seafood, but I happened to visit here and Nicole (bartender) took very good care of us. She was definitely pleasant and had a lot of suggestions for our likings. She is an excellent server!

Monday night ritual! Of all the self serve yogurt shops, Yogurtland has the best variety of flavors, and the best cookie dough ever! :)

I LOVE Chic Nails!  I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were "too busy" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since.   The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!  P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)

Went here after reading the two previous reviews. Colorful Nails was such an amazing experience, very pleasant staff and a perfect pedicure at a good price.   Tia did a wonderful job on my mom and I and is really funny and sweet. I have nothing but good things to say about this salon. I will definitely be back! :)

Not pleased at all by this place. We usually have a fairly large group when we go out on Thursdays, but service was horrible. It took almost 10 minutes just to get an iced tea. I was not impressed by the food for the price either. Furthermore, our server mixed up the cards for the split tabs and didn't even tell us about the mistake or even apologize. After talking to management they told me they were too busy to look into my issue and they would call me back when business died down, and never did. The only reason for more than one star on the review is because I called back again and the manager Sean looked into my issue and apologized on behalf of the rest of the staff.
