great space, urban/hip atmosphere. will definitely be back for the pasta bowl, but the molinari pizza was a huge mistake. lot's of parents vying for scarce high chairs. friendly staff. first time in old town gilbert...cute.  UPDATE went back for another go around. caprese pizza this time...so good with just the right amount of fresh basil. and couldn't pass up what has the be the best pasta bowl in the e. valley.

If only yelp offered negative star ratings. In need of a new cordless phone I stopped in a local Radio Shack. You would have thought it was crack the way two employees pushed the Philips cordless on me hard saying that is was the cream of the crop, that I would never experience interference between this phone and other signals, yadda, yadda, yadda. I didn't have time to do my usual two months and 12 days of research so I went for it. It turned out to be a terrible purchase. We had the phone a few weeks before hooking it up, immediately experienced problems with...wait for it...interference, and struggled with it for about two weeks before attempting to return it. This time around Mr. and Mrs. Helpful Radio Shack Employee were not so much so, refusing to take it back b/c it was past 30 days. (Did I mention it had only been out of the box two weeks at this point??) Really awful customer service. A plus? Battery chains are a dime a dozen.

Love the Tom Yom, Phat Kaprow and Panang Curry. I'm convinced they'd do a heck of a better take out business if their phone line wasn't jacked half the time!

Breakfast and coffee attached to a bookstore. Wildflower, will you marry me? This place is consistently the best breakfast around. Try the two-egg with rosemary-crusted hash browns and fresh-baked toast, but add a short-stack of traditional pancakes. They're the best in town! Lunch is great too with tons of fresh sandwiches, salads and soups to choose from. The green corn chowder and french onion soups are a must. This place is small. If you're headed out on a weekend morning and afraid of crowds try the Chandler Mall location, equally as crowded but much larger. Bon appetit!
