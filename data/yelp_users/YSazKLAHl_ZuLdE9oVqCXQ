Been coming to this Taco Bell my Whole 28yrs of Life! Can't say I've ever had any issues. My one complaint is there were times I felt some of their employees in the drive-thru want to be stingy with the HOT SAUCE! Like Bruh.. I gotta have my hot sauce baby! LoL I want to say that was going on after the most recent remodeling but more recently the late night drive thru girls always ask me how many sauces I want! As for my food it always taste good! And service is friendly and quick!

Sooooo Yummy! Onions rings are Perfect! Fries are great! I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich but got it the char grilled tariyaki style with extra pineapples! Very delicious! My only mistake was I took it to go and by the time I got home the tariyaki glaze on my chicken made the bottom bun soggy.. Still tastes good! For my drink I tried their strawberry limeade with cucumber and it tastes very refreshing and sweet!   Have to say in my opinion it's All little pricey for a burger joint but the taste makes up for it! $14.59 for my chicken sandwich fries drink and a side order of onion rings! (I couldn't resist) My service was very friendly as well.   A must try!

Ordered the 5 tacos & Medium Drink deal..(I was hungry and ate 3before I took this photo.. ) Lol. Got it with pollo asada. Asked for Xtra cilantro and onion.. That didn't happen. Tacos are really mini and when I got home tacos looked thrown together wrapped in foil. Not the greatest presentation.  Prepared Very sloppy. Their salsa is not all that, but it is spicy! I liked that they gave me lemon without having to ask! Tacos tastes okay.. If I was drunk they would have probably been amazing. For the pice, I could have gotten more from a Fili B's! Their five taco combo can be made in to ten with all the chicken they serve. If it's the only taco shop around.. Sure. Otherwise I think I'd rather get tacos from a FILI B's!  Judging by other pictures for this spot.. Looks more appealing to eat there rather than taking it to go!

Didn't know what to expect at first when I first tried this place given the fact this place has been several different restaurants the last being a pizza spot. Had a great experience the first time and came again for a second time. Chicken pho is verrry delicious !! Service is great and friendly. Location very clean! If you're looking for some good pho in the area this is a great spot to try! At least for the pho ga! (Chicken pho)
