As we pulled up to the drive-thru, the Pharmacy Tech- Russell explained the only way we could get our Rx filled in less than a couple hours was to come in and wait for it inside the store. I explained I had children in the car and he told me, "sorry, unless you come inside, we can't fulfill your order quickly" So, I lugged all the kids out of car seats and came inside the store. When talking with the Pharmasict, I told him I was paying cash as I am from out of town and he then told me my Rx would be an absurd amount when paying cash......I reminded him that it was a generic that was called in.....he looked at the Rx again and said, "oh, you DID get the generic" and told me the price was 1/4 of what he originally told me. After this discussion where the pharmacist did his best at making me feel completely stupid for paying cash, he then they told me that my Rx my doc called in wasn't in stock at that store and I will have to go to another store to get my Rx!! That would have been relevant news BEFORE you made me get out of my car and drag all my kids INSIDE!!  My father is a doctor in the area and has sworn to NEVER send patients there EVER again to fill Rx. Go to Walgreens or another place to get your Rx filled. Avoid this place if you don't want to be treated like an absolute IDIOT!

First time to a Straight Razor & Hot Shave. Victor was AMAZING!! I got the Facial, Massage, & Hot Shave. I swear I got at least 10 different hot towels and 5 different lotion treatments. I literally fell asleep for 1/2 the treatment. It was amazing. I recommend it to ANYONE & EVERYONE
