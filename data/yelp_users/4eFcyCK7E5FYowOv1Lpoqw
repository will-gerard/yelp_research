If you are looking for a new, exciting, cultural experience, and home cooked feel all in one, this is the place to go!   I grew up in Germany, and Zur Kate is beyond fantastic.  With it's traditional polka accordion player and it's nostalgic home feel decorum, combined with the extremely well prepared food, authentic German beers, and astoundingly great service, I have to give them 5 stars!

Wow, talk about disappointing!  The whole reason we came here was because they used to have steak and eggs.  When I walked up and asked for eggs, I turned to the grill guy and asked "can I get a steak medium?". He laughed at me and said "at 4pm".  Annoyed I turned around and walked up to the manager and asked why the grill guy would say that... He said "we haven't served steak at breakfast for years".  Then I remember why our family stopped coming here - the attitude of the employees was horrible.  To add salt to the wound I turned back around and asked for my eggs and the guy said "we gave them to someone else, I can make more if you still want them. ". Really?  So I walked a few steps over to find both the French toast and pancake bins empty.  I asked "can I get some pancakes?" - grill guy seemed annoyed now and said "we're working on it..." So then I walked around and took notice that many of the bins were empty.  To boot, the waitress barely spoke a lick of English.  The kids enjoyed the desert stuff... But that was about it.  I suppose you get what you pay for, and we won't be coming back.  Not the worst food or service I've ever had, but it's close.

Best...wings...ever!!!   Arizona smoked wings are smoked in mesquite wood making them smokey and fall off the bone awesome!  I got them with honey, bbq, hot  and parmesan.  The honey for sweet, the bbq for tang, the hot for a spivey kick and the Parmesan for texture and tang!  Add all that to those smokey wings and you have the best wings ever made by man!   A bit high on the price for the wings but they are SOoooooOooOo worth it!   The waitress was super nice and at tentative.

While this isn't the "best" steak I've ever had, the experience is amazing!  The steak is good, the atmosphere and unique approach to dining is so fun!  Highly recommend.
