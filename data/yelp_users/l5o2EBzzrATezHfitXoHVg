Fast, friendly service, but the food was kinda gross.  I ordered the classic cheeseburger with fries.  I washed my hands, grabbed a drink, sat down on the patio, and the food was served.  Quick.  I'm a burger lover and this was just terrible.  The meat was gray and tasteless.  And I only say this because, in attempt to taste my food, I had to use a napkin to wipe off the spooge of mayo that was drowning everything on it.  The veggies were also tasteless, but typical of what one comes to expect in American convenience food (except the pickle slices, which were probably the best thing overall).  The fries had the potential to be great, but they were overcooked, and just a bit too overfried to satisfy.  I really hate to waste food, especially on these rare occasions when I eat out, but I just couldn't finish it.  It was yucky.  I actually feel like I have a brick I need to puke up right now.  Sorry guys, but the service wasn't enough to make me wanna come back.

I'm fairly new to town, and have been looking for a great pie in the central valley since arriving.  This is by far the best tasting pizza I've had so far.  I called in, and the guys were very helpful when handling my menuless call.    Upon arriving, they had my pizza ready and were very friendly.  I took it to go and was eager to try it because it smelled heavenly.  I tried the margerita and found it to be oh, so good. I found the ingredients to be of excellent quality.  Delicious cheese, fresh basil, and firm (i.e. not slimy) tomatoes.  The crust was just right- a yeasty, crispy, tender-chewy kind of yum.  Mmmmm...  I savored my slice like it was the last pizza on earth.  Thanks Pinos!  To hell with the bad reviews, your pizza rocks!

Definitely not what I had expected. I thought it was be a cozy taqueria with style, but it was an overrated yuppie scene. Food was entirely mediocre. Bland, bland, bland. Service was slow. Overall- Meh.

Disappointing.  I love supporting local business, so when I veered into the neighborhood street to enjoy some local goodness, I was hoping for something as unique as the neighborhood that homes it.  The place was a quaint little shop, with a whole lot of sandwich selections, and the staff is friendly and welcoming.  I stood for a moment to peruse the selection and finally settled on an avocado BLT on seven grain to-go (I can't remember the clever name).  I also ordered a reasonably priced 32oz of freshly brewed tea (which was perfectly tasty).  The sandwich, drink and 'complementary' mini bag of chips came out to almost $10- a little pricey for what I got.  I eagerly opened up my sandwich to find a pretty small square of doughy bread laying over a meager melange of shredded iceberg, avocado, bacon bits and maybe tomato.  It was kinda gooey and I could hardly taste the yumminess I've come to expect with even the most modest BLT.  ...But nothing, it was so... bland!  For $10, I expected better quality ingredients.  If I go back, it'll be for the iced tea on the patio.  Sorry Ladybug.

Good place to go for a cheaper bottle of your favorite booze, but lacks in authenticity of review for some items.  I was in the mood to explore my taste, and took advantage of the staff pick card for a new drink.  Granted, I was skeptical because of the apparent "value" of the item, so I asked another staff member who enthusiastically verified the review.  Let me just say that it was horrible!  I was sold a bottom shelf item at mid shelf price for, what seemed, a bottom line quota!   Go there to get what you know you like for a cheap, warehouse price.  Stick to mom & pop's shop for taste exploration (and supporting local business & expertise).

I think ice cream is pretty disastrous, so when I tried the tsoynami, I was in frozen dessert heaven.  I've only tried the fruit blend versions, and crave them regularly.  They're good.  And they're big.  My daughter and I are easily satisfied sharing one.  I'm not a coffee drinker, but do enjoy a good chai latte now and then.  This, by far, is the best chai latte in town.  It's got a fairly descent spice (and I love the spice), and I can actually taste the ginger.  And of course, no dairy.  On the down side, my mom loves her dose of half n half in her coffee.  The non-dairy options just didn't satisfy her one bit.  I would imagine that most of my dairy loving friends might be reluctant to join me there.  Oh well.  P.S. Thanks for the doggie-patio love.  She loves riding over with me.

The food is excellent- decent quality ingredients in tasteful combinations. Wings are my fave. Fries could be fresh cut to match the richness of the sandwiches. Beers- in-house and regionals. Dragoon is my favorite house brew.

Happy Hour: 4-7 Sports bar vibe and decent food.   Had the Upper Trio pizza. Meats were of good quality. I'm picky about meatballs and sausage, and this place delivered. I'll try the meatball sliders next time. The crust was a melt on your mouth Brooklyn-style with a dusting of corn meal on the semolina.   We also had smoked wings. They were similar to those from Wild Game, so we were pleased. Sauce was mediocre, but since the smoked wings were good, the sauce mattered minimally. And since they're smoked, they were thoroughly cooked    Downsides: veggies tasted like the fridge and the place is really dead. They could stand the have a 'cheap beer happy hour' problem.   Update: food is still pretty awesome. HH beers fair, and service still meh. COME EAT THE FOOD B4 ITS GONE!!

Refurbished McDonalds building. Pretty yummy food so far. Burger with a sack of fresh cut fries. Sliders are what Mickey D hamburgers should taste like. The fried Zukes are da bomb!  Try it!
