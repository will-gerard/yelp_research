This is going to be short and sweet.... The bruschetta is one of the best around. I luv the idea of 4 different flavors on one plate. A couple of my favorites are the proscuitto and fig and the goat cheese and tomato jam. So so so...so good. The paninis are just as scrumptious. I am partial to salty and sweet flavors mixed so I go with the proscuitto and fig jam one and it always hits the spot. But, with all that said... my favorite thing at Postinos...the one thing I can not leave without eating even if I have just stuffed myself into an uncomfortable food coma... is the salted caramel sundae. OMG... ice cream with think, rich, buttery, and a hint of saltyness caramel...the little bites of chocolate covered pretzels. Holy cow... it might be on the list of possibilitys for my last meal.

I luv this place. Yes, its a hole in the wall, in the ghetto. Who cares...yes, it is a little run down. So what. The red chile beef plate and burrito are scrumptious. Big chunks of meat, sauce is flavorful, not bland at all and not too spicey. I would recommend getting your burrito dbl wrapped, because it does fall apart. You can also buy their homemade, still warm, tortillas for $3 a dozen. I would eat here everyday if I could.

Ok, so never tried this place, even though it is less than 5 minutes from my house. We (me plus 2) get there and they are super busy. Thought it was weird since it was Monday night at 8pm...but there is a wait. They have exactly- one server, one busser, and one bartender serving food to help out. We only waited about 15 minutes..not bad. We sit down, wait about 15 minutes to see a server...we decide what we want to eat by the time he actually gets there. He takes our drink order and as my friend starts to give her food order, he walks away. He comes back takes our order...we never see that guy again until the bill. When our food came, our entrees were supposed to have tortillas...but no tortillas. I got the Carne Adovada plate which was SUPER salty and had no flavor at all. It was as if they mixed masa with it to thicken it but didn't blend it well. My friend got the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were pretty good, nothing great and my other friend got seafood enchiladas which had hardly any filling to the enchiladas. I asked 3 times for the tortillas...that never came. Our waiter came after we were done with our food and asked if we wanted more drinks. We were done at that point.

By far...the absolute best place to be on a Sunday. Yes, it does get busy, especially if you go right at peak hours. Unfortunately, I work early on Mondays now so I can't par take in the festivities quite as much, but as far as a place to do some day drinking and enjoy AZ weather on the patio, it is golden. The half price bottles of wine are key...my friends and I will go there and get a bottle of wine for $12!! And we get to listen to live music too! Also, the smoked salmon plate is super yummy with capers, rye toast points and cheese... MMMM. I also love the guacamole and salsa which is a great finger food for a group.

The California club is so yummy!! Thick cut bread, over medium eggs, avocado, pesto, bacon, tomato. So good...only thing they could do better is use better quality bacon. A couple of times, the bacon was super fatty, not crunchy. The dirty chai is amazing.

Ok, so my AC has been out at my condo so I was stayin at my dad's place. He is a chef, so obviously picky about food. (to a fault). I got a pizza from this place and took it to have dinner with him one night because it's down the street from his house. Pizza was really good! I was impressed. The lady at the counter wasn't super friendly, but whatever! A couple of days later pops and I decide to go back and try the pasta dishes. We get there, drinks come in styrofoam cups which pops did not like. But, whatever, it was Mr. Pibb and I could care less. He got the Clams Linguine and I got Baked Ziti with meat sauce. Pops said his dish was absolutely "fantastic". Garlicy, lemon, lots of butter and olive oil...superb. My dish was good, I would order it again but the pasta was a little over cooked. The meat sauce itself was delicious. Ok...so the only major problem we had was when we got Tiramisu. It was half frozen.... My dad, the chef, about had a nervous breakdown. (not to the staff..just to me. He isn't the crazy customer guy). I asked the lady at the counter, who is apparently the owner, what wa sup and she said they serve it that way so it's like ice cream??? Nope...sorry. I want my tiramiso fluffy and creamy. But, with that said, the Clams Linguine was excellent.

Ok, so, I just had to write a review for these guys at Discount. I needed to get my tires rotated and balanced before a road trip so I called the nearest Discount to my work so I could go, take a long lunch and get it done. I call them just to see if they could fit me in and I speak with Jack...no problem, come right in, we will have you in and out in no time. (yeah sure, that's what they all say...) Well, to my surprise, I had AMAZING customer service. I walked in, the guy at the desk greeted me... I asked for Jack and he doesn't hesitate and calls for Jack. In the meantime, 2 other guys came in finishing orders and BOTH asked if I needed help. Nope...I am all good. Jack comes out of the office, I find out he is the manager. He is super nice and courteous. He walks me to my car, does a quick inspection...tells me to have a seat inside. I was there less than an hour and it was done. They pulled my car around and I was done. Back to work I go! Also, last but definitely not least...this place was immaculate clean for a tire place. Seriously, i would expect greasy finger prints everywhere...nothing. Shiny floors, clean windows...sparkly.

So, I went to Over Easy once before and it was "ok". Nothing great, they were super short handed, we got a free waffle because it took so long, the chicken fried steak and eggs were grissly but the gravy was good. But, I decided to give it another try. Huge mistake. We get there and the same staff problem..2 servers for the small, but very busy restaurant. My 2 friends each got the same thing, the Wolfpack. It was supposed to be eggs and chz layered between hashbrowns. I got the sirloin steak and eggs with carmalized onions. Their breakfast came out with sliced half cooked country potatoes-apparently they were out of hash browns?! How is that possible...they only serve breakfast and it was 10:30am. Mine came, it wasn't what I ordered. Fine, honest mistake, not a big deal...they went to remake it. Our server never once came over, not once, to apologize or to check to see if the food that did come was ok, which it wasn't. My breakfast came after my friends were done with what they could eat...This is the worst part. It was a plate of watery liuid gravy, grissly meat that looked like dog food, and the eggs were gooey. I took three bites of the eggs, I was starving, and couldnt eat anymore. Horrible. All three of us were still hungry when we left and frustrated as heck. They comped my breakfast... but not a chance Ill go back. I'd rather have Denny's or IHOP any day. I really think a lot of these crazy 4 and 5 star reviews are employees... no way this place was capable of 5 stars.

This place has great pizza and an amazing antipasta salad. The pizza is HUGE!!! So big that they only brought half of it to our table, then put the other in a box. Only con is there full size pizzas are a little pricey... and they need more servers because we waited for awhile for our waitress to come back by to fill drinks.

The dumplings are to die for... So are the grilled spicy shrimp... And when nothing on the menu is more than $15.95, which is a large specialty pizza, you can't beat it. Oh! And their soup of the day is always homemade and always amazing!

So, I have been to Pearl a few times now. The first time, it was ok, nothing spectacular but I liked the prices. The 2nd time- horrible. The spicy tuna roll tasted very strong, like fish that was NOT fresh at all. The other rolls we got were falling apart. The service was crappy. Welllll, I decided to give it another try because I had a certificate from restaurants.com for there. So, I grab 2 of my friends and we head that way. We sit down, one friend goes to the restroom. I am sitting with a friend from Chicago who has never been there so she has no idea what they are about. A girl walks over with the 3 menus they have (sushi, appetizers, and drink menus). This girl HAS TO BE either drunk or stoned... She asks if we have been there before and I let her know I had but my friend was new. She then says that she is just helping, not our waitress, and if our waitress doesn't explain the menu, I can....what???! So, she wants ME to explain the menu to my friend??? Weird. Anyway, finally our server comes, we order 2 miso soups and an edaname. The stoned girl who is "helping" brings 1 soup and the edaname. I politely say that we had an extra soup when she had a chance...She then looks at me strangely and asks "Did you order it with your server?"....Really??? So, we order our food, one friend orders a beer. The beer comes out with ice in it?? The food comes....horrible. The fish is very strong again. I got yellowtail and it was very mushy and tasted suuuper fishy. My friend had a shrimp tempura roll that fell apart everytime she dipped in soy. I couldn't even eat mine... finally we want the bill. Server is no where to be found until we see her chatting with another table. Fine, thats her job to be friendly...15 minutes later we ask the bartender if we can get our tab and he acts like we are being jerks. Moral of the story...Pearl Sushi, I gave u 3 chances... thats enough. Get some fresh fish... I know your menu is cheap, but I'd rather pay more for good fish. Also, get some servers who are a little more professional and experienced. And do some drug tests while you are at it.

LUUUUV this place. Happy hour is great...servers are great!! I have frequented both locations and never had a problem. No, it may not be a "new, fun, hip place" but it is a nice/casual place. I have gotten the coconut shrimp and I thought it was great...it comes with this super yummy orange marmalade sauce...not sure what happened with the other Yelper. I always see more than one manager walking around and I'm sure if there was an issue they'd be quick to fix it.

This place is not only inexpensive, but the burgers are amazing. AND THEY HAVE HAAGEN DAAZ MILKSHAKES!!! Sooo good.... I got a 1/3 lb cheesburger with a fried egg on it. It was cooked perfectly, not greasy at all. I will for sure be back!

I went here about a week ago with the boytoy. Super cute little place, great ambience. Nice little patio once it isn't 900 degrees outside. We ordered the calamari first. This is why they lost a star. It wasn't bad at all, but the calamari pieces were super small! : (....I was dissapointed. And the marinara that came with it was very tasty, but SUPPPER salty! I love salt but this was a little much. But we still finished it. We then did a build your own pizza- with mushrooms, onions, and peppers. It came and was very good. I love places that use fresh mozzarella and they do. The only thing, which isn't a big deal, is that the crust was slightly soggy. We had to eat it with a fork and knife. But it was very flavorful, not greasy like other pizza places who use the fake mozzarella. One big plus, the bartender came after we had waited a bit for our pizza and gave us a mini frozen limoncello drink that had tangerine in it. OMG...so tasty. And perfect for a summer night. All in all...we'll be back.

Not that post offices ever have friendly, helpful employees.. But this one takes the cake. An older blonde lady was so rude, unfriendly. I had a simple box to send and it apparently wasn't taped correctly.. So I was advised that I would need to purchase a whole roll of tape to tape it better in order to send it. Understandable in some cases... but the way she want about it was horrible customer service. Also, there was a woman in front of me who stood there for 5 minutes while 3 employees walked around and never acknowledged her.

I have no idea how this place has so many stars. My boy toy and I have been here twice now and neither time was great. It's just... Meh. Not horrible, but not great. I had the hash brown burrito the first time and he had the huevos rancheros. My burrito had nothing but a fried egg, a little but of hash browns.. And bacon. Then, my last 4 bites or so had sausage. No sour cream, pico, cheese... Very plain. His had the eggs with what was definitely canned enchilada sauce.. The refried beans were no better than the canned beans you an buy at the store. The second time we tried a fish taco and burrito... Same experience. The fish had no flavor and was overly fried. I think Los Favoritos close by is way better for a fast food Mexican!

So I tried Over Easy for a third and final time. It's been a few years..and it's a different location. Annnnd the fiancé wanted to try it because he had never been. We both ordered mimosas. I had a pomegranate flavored and he had a Bellini flavored. Both came in glasses filled with ice, which was strange.. and both were soooooo sweet and sugary. They weren't what we expected but they had alcohol in them.. So we drank em. He ordered chicken and waffles and I ordered the Benedict with biscuits and sausage instead of the traditional. His was OK.. The chicken was cooked well but very small portion. Not a lot to it. My dish was not good. The biscuits were stale and crumbly. The sausage was for sure a frozen sausage patty warmed up and the "Hollandaise" sauce had no flavor at all. Also, we were seated by one girl.. Another one took our drink and food order. She never came back to the table. Then, another waiter walked by and asked if we were good... We were but needed a check. So, he went and told our server who brought our check..and never came back. Luckily, we paid with cash and just left.

Tried this place tonight with my boo and  I am definitely a fan. He loved his carne asada burrito and my enchiladas were super tasty. They are a little different than the traditional saucy enchilada, but good flavor.  The rice was very good and the mexican slaw had pumpkin seeds in it, which added a nice crunch! The main thing that would keep us going back was the amazing service. Our server was Kimberly and she took care of us from start to finish. It is refreshing to go out and actually get great service.

Ok, so this place kept popping up on our yelp searches so the man and I decided to give it a try since we love New Mexican style food. We walk in and the hostess says there will be live music in 20 minutes in the bar area at 8pm. Awesome, we think. We sit down and immediately notice how pricey drinks and food are. Whatever, no biggy.. I order the green and red chile plate and he gets the enchiladas. (Mind you, they only have one enchilada option). My chile plate was shredded beef with enchilada sauce on top.. And black beans, definitely canned, and rice. That's it. If I wanted beef with enchilada sauce on top, I can get that at Filibertos. Red/green chile should be cooked in the sauce and very flavorful with a little spice. Very bland! Also, it came with 1 sopapilla to put the meat on. Just 1. So I have a plate of shredded meat with nothing but 1 piece of 3"x3" dough to put it on. No tortillas. And if I wanted ONE TORTILLA it was $1.50. Ridiculous. The enchiladas were lacking in everything from cheese, sauce, to meat. He asked for more sauce for his meal and it came in a big bowl with no spoon so he poured it from the bowl. The live music, btw, was so so bad. Loud and not at all dining appropriate. To make matters worse, half way through the meal they seat 4 high school boys literally right next to us.. In the bar area. The entire time they are extremely loud and obnoxious showing each other inappropriate pics on their phones and sarcastically singing along to the live music. Isn't it illegal to have underage kids in the bar area without a parent? If not, it is at least bad management. I thought for a second we were on that reality show "Boiling Point". We couldn't get our check quick enough. With that said, service was pretty decent considering the poor guy was by himself.

I have dined at pita jungle several times and it is always great food and service. I went in on Monday and was greeted as soon as I got there. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. My super cute server, Ashley, was awesome. I ordered one of my usuals, the pesto lavosh wrap, but she recommended I order it with their lemon pepper chicken breast instead... MIND BLOWN. Throw some siracha on that baby and I could eat that every day for the rest of my life. I also love that it comes with a side of their awesome greek salad and the wrap is plenty for 2 meals! Their food always seems so fresh and satisfying. I have never had a bad meal or service at any of their locations.

Tried this place out and I am so mad I waited so long! It was awesome! We started with a lb of shrimp with the trifecta seasoning... Delish! We ended up getting a lb of snow crab after and it was super yummy, but the shrimp are the way to go. Cornbread was perfect for dipping in the drippings! It's a messy meal, but that's part of the fun. Also, Melissa, our server, was awesome.. Super helpful and friendly!

Tried Queso Good for the first time at the Gilbert Food Truck event on Fridays. SO SO SO good!! Had the carnitas quesadilla and a huge mason jar of fresh cantaloupe juice. The quesadilla was flavorful and delicious. Nice and cheesy and messy. The juice was unbelievable. I bought another jar to take home and put vodka in...Don't judge me.

This place is awesome. Great tacos, super reasonable, and nice adult beverage selection. They have several craft beers, which is a nice touch for my main squeeze. The cod tacos are super yummy.. They have great happy hr deals too. Only crappy thing is that it's only offered Monday-Thursday. But, great little patio.. And every time I have been, the service was very laid back and friendly.

Hubby and I have been to Crust multiple times. (Scottsdale and Chandler) Service is always awesome! Never, ever, had a bad experience. Managers and/or owner always stop by to check on us. The food is ALWAYS delicious. How stylist, never had a bad meal. Consistency is key! And we have even had managers bring by food we didn't order so we could try it. (Kitchen mistakes) tonight we ordered just a caprese salad and cheese NY style pizza. So friggin good. AND HALF ORICE BOTTLES OF WINE (Mondays). Yes, you read that correctly... The manager tonight was Nick and he gave us a chilled or room temp option for our red wine, which was awesome because I'm a weirdo and like my red wine chilled. There are a couple of really ridiculous reviews on here.. As with any Yelp account, make sure you read what the customers write and the reasoning for giving less than stellar reviews. Don't pass this place up! And if there's a problem, let someone know so they can fix it! Problem solved!
