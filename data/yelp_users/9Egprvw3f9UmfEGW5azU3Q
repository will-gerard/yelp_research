I am a lover of the 24 hour burrito places. Really I am, and given the fact this is the one that happens to be closest to me I am always disappointed that this place isn't better. I have NEVER, in the 10 or so times I've been here, ever gotten my order 100 percent correct. Either they forget my guacamole, or give me sprite instead of mountain dew, the list goes on. In Phoenix we are absolutely lucky with these types of places and I suggest for you to skip this one. I drive 5 miles down the road to pick up my burritos at 4 a.m. I just can't justify suggesting a place that never has gotten my order right. The only thing that is making this a 2 star and not a 1 star is the food is actually pretty good. Not better then some of the other "urtos" out there and they do undercook the potatoes but other than that they are good. Not great. Meh.

This place is the very definition of a hole in the wall. In fact it's wedged in between an appliance repair store and a trash can. There are 5 tables in the place and one outside. But don't let the interior fool you. The sole employee I ever see working here is very kind and energetic. They serve beer and wine which is always a plus in these hole in the walls. The food is great and hearty. Every dish comes with at least 2 other things they throw in a cup for you. My favorite thing here is the Argentina carne asada. But beware, it is HOT. The ceviche is the best I have had in Phoenix and the pork empanadas are great appetizers. All in all I would recommend this place to anyone. There is "safe" food there so you can bring your squeamish friends there to kick their taco bell habits and just enough outside the norm food to please the experimental side in us all. Pricing is great too. Easily 5 stars if I ever seen one.

The Codfather was one of those places I wasn't expecting too much from and got way more than I expected. I've now ate almost everything on the menu in some form or another and I have never been underwhelmed with anything I have gotten. They have a great beer selection and a fantastic selection of fried appetizers.   The fish and chips are definitely the flagship here but don't sleep on their more traditional stuff. The pies are great here and bangers and mash and all of the different "versions" of it on the menu are all fantastic. If I had to recommend my favorite dishes to a newcomer here other than the obvious fish and chips platter the "banger, bubble & squeek,  and beans" and the "beef and kidney pie" are both my favorites the deep fried sausage is also one of those things where it's so good you don't care about the heart attack it's going to for sure give you.  Pros: I have ate here at least 15 times trying most if not everything on the menu and I have never had anything bad or even so-so. Everything has been steller. As long as you understand you are eating at a fish n chip/fried food joint and not a fancy seafood resteraunt you won't be dissapointed. They also have a pretty great beer selection on tap.  Cons: Now even though I can promise you I have never ate something here that wasn't good if I seriously had to nit pick a con here it would have to be pricing. I feel like EVERY dish excluding the English breakfast I pay 1 dollar too much for. Just comparing it to similar resteraunts serving similar things this place is a little pricier than most. It's not so overpriced that it should stop you from eating here but it does prevent me from say, eating there regularly, even though the food deserves it. They also seem to have a difficult time keeping the beer they have on tap stocked regularly. Every time I sit at the bar at least one beer on tap is out. Meh. Not a big deal but just an observation.  All in all "The Codfather" is one of those places that you not only have to try but will undoubtedly make you want to come back again and again. The only reason it doesn't have the 5 star is that I can't walk in there and have a beer and meal and walk out spending less than 30 dollars after the tip. A little more than I expect when going to a place like that. But WOW they are seriously consistently great with everything they have on that menu! Highly recommended.

Yen is a fantastic choice for anyone needing their sushi fix. That's the best thing going for them, their food. Hands down the best eel I've ever had in town and close to the best oyster shooters I've taken. The green muscles are hands down the best appetizer I've had in any sushi joint. The chefs behind the bar are also very friendly and don't mind drunken people talking their ear off while working. The only problem with yen is that its really only worthwhile during the happy hour's they have and at that time it's almost impossible to get a seat without waiting and don't even try to get to the bar during those times. So your forced to sit at a table and be waited on by sub-par waitresses. Out of the 20 or so times I've been there I've had great service maybe 3 times at a table. Slow on refills and even refusing to split a check for my party on numerous occasions. But you take the good with the bad and I would recommend this place over any huge sushi restaurant with flash any day.

Let me start of by saying that my "last meal" if i was ever on death row would be Pho. I love the stuff. Now that i said that, I had the best bowl of Pho i have ever had in the united states here. Period. I had the bowl with everything in it, I believe it is the first option under the Pho menu there. Everything about the bowl was perfect. The broth, noodles, the exact perfect ratio of the flank, tripe etc. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming which is something i havent experienced a lot in places like this. I had at least 5 or 6 people walk up to me making sure i was taken care of. Absolutely everyone working there were all smiles. Now if that werent enough the prices are incredible. My bowl was HEARTY. I can put down some Pho, and the portion had me completely stuffed. And it was like 8 bucks. Incredible bang for your buck.   I would recommend this place to anybody and everybody. Absolutely go out of your way to come here. I not only intend to be back, but i can see myself very easily being a regular here. Incredible food, incredible price, incredible staff. And they serve beer.   10/10
