In my last few weeks in Phoenix I tried to line up as many restaurants to try as possible, especially hoping to find some worthy Mexican food. I enjoyed my lunch at the Comedor and would gladly return.  The spot is huge; a re-purposed event ballroom I'm told. A group of four of us went one Sunday for lunch and though the space was pretty full of families, we were seated within 5 minutes.   For lunch I ordered shrimp enchiladas which came four to a plate (corn tortillas) with rice and refried beans. Tasted great, the shrimp were cooked well, not rubbery, and the chile sauce was lightly spicy. One friend ordered the chicken mole, and I had a few bites and would highly recommend it. Admittedly the mole was not spicy enough for either of our tastes, but it was rich and complex, and the chicken was spectacular: so moist and tender, just swimming in the thick sauce. mmmmmmm!   Reasonably priced, generous with seating, quick service and solid Mexican fare.

Last night the Chihuly exhibit opened and I visited the garden this afternoon.  $15 is a hefty entrance fee, so i brought a book...i was going to make it worth my while. The installations are AMAZING. My usual response to modern art is "huh?" but this felt organic and otherworldly all at once. The pieces are scattered all over the garden and I would definitely suggest going during the 4PM-8PM showing so you can see the sculptures in daylight and twilight. At about 6PM the garden lit up and it was so cool to see the huge sculptures like Moon and Saffron out across the dark desert backdrop.   This is not to be missed, though you have time, Chihuly will be showing his work through May 2009.

I don't care if Costco signals the general decline of humanity - I love it. It's a huge chain and I love it and regularly spend hours there strolling the aisles, tasting the samples, calculating the per item cost/value ratios. Okay I guess that's no surprise coming from the President of the Grocery Store Fan Club.   I've not been to other Costcos in Arizona, but this is the first time I've seen one with a gas station. Yay! I don't mind saving a few cents off each gallon especially now when gas prices yo-yo faster than the stock market. Costco is THE place to go when you are setting up a home for the first time. I would know. I got everything from laundry detergent, books, food, camisoles and even a patio set here.   And though navigating the parking lot on a Saturday is akin to wading through the fourth ring of hell, you can basically eat a free meal with the absurd amount of samples being handed out. One saturday I had lox on bagels, guacamole and tortilla chips, snack mix, pasta with an artichoke alfredo sauce and angelfood cake topped with whipped cream and a strawberry. yay! I've heard their churros are also yummy but have never eaten at the little cafe. clearly there's no need to.

I went into this Michael's with two items to return. I noticed that there was only one cashier and a line 5 people deep, but luckily there was an employee behind the service desk. As I stood waiting to talk with her I realized the people she was talking to were not customers but two other employees, and the three of them were bitching about a customer who had wanted to make a return and how annoying she had been. Then one of them (Nancy) noticed me standing there, turns around and says to me "you're making a return? you can get in the regular line." seriously? did you really just suggest that your conversation is so much more critical than helping a customer that I should go wait in another line? that's very interesting Nancy, thanks. Meanwhile the other two don't even look at me, including the one manning the service desk. what the hell?!  I walk over to the one open register and wait for about 15 minutes while this one cashier works through all the people ahead of me. And I kid you not, when I was one person away from freedom, Nancy noticed that there were 3 people behind me, opened up a register and told the woman BEHIND ME to come over.   Frankly I think all three of those employees should be fired for wasting Michael's and my time while getting paid. I'm sure they make crap pay but that is no excuse for flagrant laziness. It has cost Michael's my business.

Re: Grooming Salon. Specifically, Katie, the cat handler.  It is near to impossible to find cat groomers in this town. Some vets offer the service but after today's visit to Petsmart I won't go anywhere else. So the deal is I have a demon cat. Well, she's lovely and adorable with me, but for some reason fears all pet workers. No clue why, nothing bad has ever happened to her.   Katie works Tuesday through Friday and starts at 7am, which I can appreciate because no one else should have to witness the dramatics my cat puts on. I arrived after calling ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches, so as to avoid bits clinging to her backside (gross.)  Katie got an E-collar on Josie and told me she was going to have to scruff her while she worked, which was just fine with me because the cat was screaming like a murder victim and otherwise being embarrassing. In less than ten minutes the job was done (for only $6!) and Josie was back in her carrier like nothing happened.   Look, I had a veterinarian tell me that if I brought Josie in for any grooming they would SEDATE her, and she also recommended I get her declawed, which I believe is inhumane. Maybe Katie considers what she does completely normal and reasonable, but she's the first professional who has worked with Josie...professionally.   I know my cat is a total freak but I can't shave her ass myself, so thank god Katie is at Petsmart. Seriously.

It has come to my attention that I have not reviewed Rokerij. Clearly this is a travesty of justice so I'm here to make things right in the world. I've been to Rokerij twice now and both times left fat and happy. and buzzed.   I dined at Rokerij on Sunday evening; it was a "Saves the Day" moment because the first choice restaurant fell through and Dottsy was starving and reaching for my throat. We booked it to Rokerij and sat at the sexy copper bar, ready to partake in some small plate action. As everyone has mentioned, the happy hour deals are for the bar only, between 4-6PM. They are running a new wine promotion too: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, all bottles are 50% off. Yay! I ordered all the seafood plates: mushrooms stuffed with crab, ceviche, ahi tuna w/ wasabi, and crab tostadas. With the Long Boat Sauvignon Blanc in hand I was in heaven.   I like that the bar is dark and cozy, though I noticed a light was actually out above me, making it near impossible to see my menu. The Happy Hour deal rocks, but it does make me sad not to be able to sit in those comfy leather chairs by the fire sipping wine and stuffing my face on ultra-cheap eats.   Rokerij is a solid performer, and probably deserves that 5th star, but I'm holding off until I finally dine in the main restaurant and enjoy one of their delicious sounding entrees.

Well I certainly wouldn't mind living here...unless spearmint flavored ghosts wander the halls after midnight. Anyway...I had a lovely evening here celebrating the birthdays of Matthew and Shannon and even Emily (?) whom I hadn't met. The place absolutely targets an older crowd but the indoor lounge space above the bar was comfortable enough for our group and nearly private.   I'm not a huge liquor drinker so I missed out on the five dollar cocktails until 7PM and their wine list was okay but had very few by the glass options. The chef's taco of the night was cod and even though it was a frozen battered affair, the seasonings really brought it to life. The tortillas were a disaster though, they were literally pulled straight from the Mission flour tortilla bag and not even heated. sad. Oh i snatched a few truffle flavored french fries from Christina and thought they were just right...mmm french fries...  Wrigley's has a beautiful organic feel to it, the way it hugs the hilltop and the views are killer! Briana was very friendly and it was nice to see the chef come up to say hello too. The Friday night live music was not my speed, but god bless that man for singing his heart out to a practically empty room. I think this would be a great place for a private party, maybe a rehearsal dinner or business party.

Oh Village. I know you want five stars. Everyone else here agrees with you. But I have been a member of an equally awesome gym (one might argue more so) that didn't cost two arms, one leg and a few spinal vertebrae to pay for. So from me darling, you will only get 4 stars.   Sorry Pinche, the Village ain't no secret. I know this because the parking lot is packed to the gills when I arrive every morning and is still at about 60% when I leave. I sometimes want to drive by at midnight to see if any obsessed workout-aholics are parked out there just waiting for 5AM (7AM weekends).   What can I tell you, the Village has a ton of classes, loads of equipment, tennis courts, 2 pools, a basketball court, an indoor track (1/18th of a mile thank you), multiple exercise rooms, a full spa/salon, a cafe, a bar, lounges, wifi, steam room, sauna, whirlpool, showers with shampoo, conditioner, shaving cream, AND lotion, beauty stations with hair driers and curling irons, q-tips and cotton pads.   It's everything you could want.   BUT...the joining fee. $990 for individual memberships. That is just offensive. I mean, honestly, if they said, "Please make a $990 donation to one of our 3 sponsored charities" I would think they were a kick-ass organization, but they just want to make sure you have enough money to hang with the rest of their clientele. I'm soo over that. Luckily for me the economy's in the dump and the Village is offering deals for joining. I saved some money, got a few gift certificates, and now that I'm here I'm happy as a clam.   There are loads of class (aerobic, yoga, pilates, tai chi, strength, spinning) options up until 11AM and after 4PM, the staff is friendly, the entire facility is impeccably maintained, and even though the parking lot is filled to the brim you don't ever feel crowded, much less wait for equipment. It simply wouldn't do, darling.   I think it's rather absurd that gym options in AZ are this or dumps like Bally's, considering how physique-conscious everyone is, but who am I to get on a soapbox since I now number the faceless, moral-less elite. My socialistic tendencies aside...I love this gym.

About two months ago I needed to get waxed, and I would normally head to the Brow Lady but thought I'd give the Spa a chance, since I'm there daily already. I called in advance for an appointment. I went in and was led to the Relaxation Room by the very friendly Spa receptionist. I had arrived ten minutes early for the appointment, hoping she could take me sooner and I could be on my way sooner. There was not one other person in the Relaxation Room with me. There also isn't a wall clock and I soon found out why.   My extra ten minutes pass. No waxer approaches me. Another ten minutes go by and I'm sitting there twiddling my thumbs wondering what is going on. I decide to go up front and see what the deal is. The receptionist says she will find out and I tell her I have places to go and can't wait much longer. I go back to the relaxation room...which is now not at all relaxing. Five more minutes pass....the receptionist comes to say she's sorry and the waxer will be right with me. It was at least another five, maybe even ten, and I was boiling mad. The waxer finally strolled in and of course the waxing itself took a whopping 2 minutes.  Sure she was nice enough but she was almost half an hour late for my appointment. The receptionist didn't think it was worth comping me the $13.50 cost so the waxer received no tip.   The second time I used the Spa was when I injured my back in one of the classes and had to run, crying, out of the class. There is no Sports Medicine person on staff as far as I was aware so I hobbled to the Spa and found the receptionist in the back of the salon. I begged for a massage therapist to help me and she told me no one was there and massages didn't start until 9AM. This, by the way was at about 8:10AM. I'm standing in front of this woman, having trouble breathing and crying uncontrollably and she's telling me to wait an hour? Finally she figured out I was NOT kidding and said she'd call around to see who could come in ASAP. She helped me into a chair in the very UN-relaxing room and I wept alone there for about 15 minutes. She happened by the door again after that and said that a masseuse would be there in 15-20 minutes. I had no cell phone, watch or wall clock to measure that time, nor was any other help offered so I just continued weeping. It was 8:30AM (I'm guessing) when another spa-goer arrived for her day of treatments and went into the locker room to change. I managed to get in there as well (after a bit) and ask her if she knew the time. 8:45AM.   Obviously my massage therapist didn't show up until 9AM. That would be too bloody much to ask when one has a crippling back injury. Sure the massage was decent (not in price mind you). I just feel like my time and money are completely unappreciated and I absolutely will not return there. By the way, the showers in the spa area are TERRIBLE. The ones in the locker room are much better and on the whole the bathroom/locker room in the spa is a waste of space.

I've experienced Postino two different ways in the past two weeks: a late night visit for tea and sparkling wine and a few days later to grab pick up for my boss and myself.   The first visit was a nice intro, I like the location, tucked in on Campbell, and the interior design is cozy (fab chandelier!). The retail wine area at the entrance is awkward to me, because it's cramped and I frankly think you should all be buying wine at my shop so perhaps I'm a touch biased. Anyway, it is a great way for you to take home whatever you enjoyed with your dinner. Damn magnanimity.   I wasn't in the mood for drunk biking that night so I skipped the adult beverages for a pot of tea. I get that this is a wine cafe so really no one going here is going to review a cup of tea, except for me. Tea selection was sad. Tea has the same cult following that wine does, so three options seemed half-hearted. And my pot of hot water was only half filled, which, for $2.50 is lame.  Okay I'm done bashing PW.   The second time I drove in for a take out order of the bruschetta board. My order was ready, the place was packed and I was able to get in and out in less than 3 mins! We ordered the date and pistachio on ricotta, the fig and prosciutto, the mozz/tomato/basil and the smoked salmon pesto. Great value to order ratio, each slice was huge and pre-chopped into littler bites. The smoked salmon was definitely my favorite, with the runner up being the pistachio/date combo. The MTB was a little dry for me and I don't eat prosciutto so that was for my boss.  I love that they have neighborhood night deals and that you can friend them on facebook and get a special word of the day to get $5 glasses of wine no matter what time of night!

I have been looking for a nursery (of the plant variety only thank god) since I moved here and I don't know how I missed these reviews. Baker's is so close and so charming! It actually feels like a garden in and of itself, is arranged very neatly as well. I took some time to stroll along the paths, wishing I had more than just a northeast facing patio on which to house plants.   I had read about the super helpful staff and I did speak to someone who helped me and gave me new ideas on what to do with my relatively shady space. I have to say though, that I was wandering alone for a long while without being approached by any employees and they don't seem to have Bakers t-shirts, nametags or aprons or anything to help identify them.   I am going to start building my garden slowly and I'm thrilled to have such a great place to go to and hopefully I will be able to get some more help to keep my leafy babies thriving. I noticed that on March 14 there is going to be a Q&A session with their gardening staff so I will make a point to be there!

I purchased my bed at this location just over 1 year ago. The sales guy seemed nice, we tried a bunch of beds, he wasn't pushing me in any expensive direction, and he guaranteed delivery the same day. I paid $800 for a double bed and box spring.   One year later and I'm ordering a new bed from someplace else. This is the worst mattress I've ever slept on. I'm not a particularly picky sleeper - even my college dorm mattress was fine. I am sensitive to drooping mattresses and this one felt sunken almost one month out of the gate and after one year I can't take it anymore.  Take a look at any mattress warranty and you'll see that up to 2 INCHES of drooping is considered normal and does not warrant replacement or compensation. Rad.   Mattress purchasing is so insanely subjective that I wouldn't dissuade you from shopping at Bedmart; I'm sure someone else could find a bed they love and use for years there.  My own experience is that I wasted $800 with no recourse.

So disappointed. All the reviews here are great, and this is so close to my home that I was excited to bring my kitten in to set up a health relationship with these veterinarians. But in the past two weeks my cat has had two different non-emergency but still urgent care situations come up and BCVC totally dropped the ball.  Please note that the 2 star score is because the doctors themselves are pretty nice. If you can get to them.   Last week it was diarrhea, which could mean a myriad of larger problems. I called after business hours and left a message for the on call vet, Dr. Dutton on the 'non-emergency' line. I just wanted to find out if there were symptoms to be looking for. The Dr. never returned my call. The next morning and a totally unconcerned receptionist told me there were no same day appointments, 1 appointment the next day in mid-afternoon (when I'm at work) and a few the 2nd day in the morning. The 2nd day appt was made and I went in to see Dr. Brandt who was fairly prompt and examed Josie, gave her a 72 hour vitamin med to help her bowels and sent us off.   Last night I got home to a cat with one eye almost completely shut and weeping, with green mucus, a very red third eyelid. Scary. I knew I had to wait until 7AM to call, because BCVC doesn't take messages, and clearly the on call vets don't give a shit, so I got up this morning and just brought her in at 7, hoping they could spare a minute to look at my cat's freaky eye problem. There was no one else in the waiting room (of course) when I arrived, yet the receptionist told me there were no appointments available until 4PM (again when I'm working) and had no interest in letting me see someone now. I asked if they had affiliate clinic recommendations, or a nearby rec at least, and she said no. She did offer to let me leave my cat ALL day in a cage at the clinic so she would be there for the 4PM appointment, but well, my cat can't explain her symptoms to the doctor now can she?  Finally I squeezed the name of an emergency clinic on 40th and Cactus out of her and took off for there.   Look I'm sorry my cat can't get sick on your schedule Blue Cross Veterinary Clinic, but maybe for your next customer (since I won't be returning) you could offer a bit of compassion for an animal in distress.

Yeah yeah, whole paycheck, cry me a river. Everyone knows exactly what to expect here, I'm not going to whine about high prices. The prepared foods area at this WF is much more restrained than at any other WF I've been to, which is sad because I used to love ogling the selections at my Boston shop. I think this location has a somewhat small but interesting wine selection but my real purpose for this review is to talk about the cheese shop.   Arizonans have absolutely no cheese culture. Sorry. I love AZ and I'm glad I live here, but when I think about exotic cheese I don't think 'gruyere'. Cheese selection is the only way in which Arizona has failed me, until I met Laura, my Whole Foods Cheese Monger (not Lara of Petit Fromage).  After truly depressing excursions to AJs (their cheese is a JOKE and they should be embarrassed), then Trader Joe's and Safeway I called over to Whole Foods and connected with Laura. I asked her about certain cheeses I was looking for and we agreed to meet that evening to find unique options for a wine tasting I was hosting.    Laura explained that in the heat of the summer her cheese selection is rather sparse and that it would be picking back up in the fall. The cheese area is one of the smaller that I've seen, but there are some fun options beyond a simple Parrano or Gorgonzola Dolce. I saw some of my old favs like Taleggio, Explorateur, and Humboldt Fog and Laura introduced me to a few new friends, like Hirtenkase, the delightful german cheese that is made from some of the most pampered cows in the world! I decided on a refreshing chevre called Fleur Vert from California, Mimolette and Chaubier, though Laura very generously let me taste through a horde of options to find the right cheese and wine pairings.   I really look forward to checking back in with her to see what new treats are in. I hope I can use her expertise for more wine events and I encourage you, nay, I insist you step away from that enormous Costco Manchego and talk to the Whole Foods Cheese staff about your exotic dairy needs. Broaden your horizons!

Rock on! I had no idea that right in Phoenix was the site of the original hub of the Hohokam people in the first century. This museum is so interesting and while the 10 minute intro video is informative, and i'm sure kids enjoy the Dig It zone, but the archaelogical park is my favorite part of the tour.   It's so hard to picture the life the Hohokam lived here a thousand years ago, but the plaques scattered around the park paint a great picture of early desert living. Also fun are the reconstructed home and pit houses that you can go inside of and check out daily life for Hohokam people.   I love that the entry fee is only $5 because you really are transported at Pueblo Grande.

My first visit to Hiro was a delight! I came in for dinner and sat up at the bar where sushi chef Leo was really friendly and offered up some helpful suggestions.  I started with the $2 miso soup which was not watered down and had some meaningful chunks of tofu in it and was just right to warm me up on this cold AZ day. I ordered the Houston roll and the Crazy roll for my main meal and while I waited I eyed the slabs of fishmeat hungrily.  My Houston Roll was up first - really smooth fatty salmon slices with julienned cucumbers and scallions, an inside out roll. The total effect wasn't especially overwhelming, more of a palate for wasabi and soy sauce. But good quality maki for sure. The Crazy Maki is Leo's favorite I'm told, and I can see why. First of all, I have never had a soy paper roll, that was fun (and pink!).  The Crazy Maki has a tempura shrimp rolled up with spicy tuna, avocado and roe. Most restaurants make the tuna with spicy mayonnaise, but this was mayo free (i'm a mayo-phobe) and ultra silky in texture. the maki is a fattie but because it's rolled in soy paper you can eat it in bites, unlike seaweed rolls which if you try to bite will empty their contents on your shirt and lap while everyone in the restaurant stares at you. so yay for soy paper!   I have one singular criticism: the wasabi was not spicy. i was putting a quarter-sized amount on each sushi piece just to get a tingle - so I ran out quickly and didn't ask for more (what for). Have all my tastebuds died? do they make particularly weak wasabi at Hiro's? I don't know but I'm prepared to do some arduous wasabi studies at Hiro Sushi for the rest of my life.

I don't think I've ever stayed at a TownPlace Suites, but I checked in to this one recently and have had a great stay. TPS is located right off the 101 N and Shea Blvd, and is close to a number of strip malls, the hospital, and not too far from downtown Scottsdale.   I got a studio suite, so I thought I would have a basic hotel room with a little kicthenette. I was pleased to find a queen sized bed, a sitting area with couch and chair, desk space with free high-speed internet, basically a full kitchen (electric stove/oven, dishwasher, full-size fridge) and an updated bathroom.   The hotel offers a light continental breakfast (think fruit, yogurt, cereal, apple juice and coffee), a small gym PLUS access to the Bally's down the street, on-site laundry, and a heated swimming pool. Unfortunately the pool is right at the reception entrance on the parking lot so you don't exactly have a private feel in that area. Otherwise I think this is a really great extended stay hotel and good value.

Now I know that I stopped by the Sunflower Market in the middle of a work day, but this place was totally abandoned. I think 2 other customers came in after me, but essentially I was alone in a natural foods wonderland, and hey, that's okay with me. Especially since this branch has some hot male employees...anyway what am i reviewing here?   Pretty big store front, bigger than most of the Whole Foods I've patronized back home, and a good selection of food that doesn't seem over-the-top granola-y. The produce wall is GORGEOUS, i could just envision making the world's biggest and most beautiful salad. The icing on the cake (for me at least) is their bulk food bins, with everything from Live Yeast and Bulgher to Cinnamon Licorice and Crystallized Ginger.  I bought a big bag of Wasabi Peas and some ginger to tide me over on my afternoon excursion.  Hopefully an empty store at lunch time doesn't mean a struggling store because Sunflower Market is lovely!

After a very frustrating bike shopping experience I went over to Landis to see what kind of selection and customer service they offered.  I stopped by on a Saturday morning and met Rob who spent the next 45 minutes going over bicycles and options with me. When I gave him my budget he directed me to a Trek 7100 and went over the details and differences between a WSD and men's bike. Then we went out back and I rode the bike, which was slightly embarrassing, seeing as how I'm a total spaz. He didn't laugh though, and watched me ride with an expert's eye to my positioning so he could tell me about adjustments and bike customization. I tried out two different sizes of the Trek and went through a number of seat adjustments before we decided which would be the best fit. I felt really good about it and when we went back in he happily put together an invoice for me with all the bicycle accessories which he went over one by one in depth as well.   Rob also spoke to the owner and was able to throw in the heavy duty tubes and slime for free for me, as well as a water bottle and cage. The total came within my budget, which really sealed the deal. We talked about servicing the bike and the changes I would notice in it in the first month or so of riding it and he said I could come in for my bike's "90 day check up" for free.   I came back on Monday to pay for the bike and ride it home (six whole miles!) and while Rob wasn't there, another employee very helpfully went over all of my details again, told me about service options, answered more questions I'd come up with and in general was another nice bike guy I'll be glad to see when I come in for tune ups.   The only problem with Landis is that I don't live closer and the ride home was terrifying. I will load it onto a bus when I have to go back, for SURE. I've been riding every day since I got it (4 days ago) and think I made the best possible decision. Thanks again to Landis for all the help and attention with my first bike purchase!

you'll probably never stay at this location, because there are so many places downtown to check in to, but i have enjoyed my stay at the springhill suites and have found their staff both nice and very understanding.   i came in late and the front desk agent was quick with the key and wished me well as she told me about breakfast and internet options.  in the morning i enjoyed a "continental breakfast plus" (some hot options) and the dining area in the lobby has a great room feel and a very nice flat screen tv.  there is also a front porch with a few dining tables and it's shady and catches a breeze which became a perfect lunch spot for me and my salad.     i was granted a late check out so i sunbathed by the pool, waded around in it for a while and generally sweated. a lot.  there is also a small gym with a treadmill, bike and elliptical which i did not use but looked at intently as i passed by.    the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the air conditioning was on and the kitchenette was perfect for my 1 night/1 day stay.    best of all, even though i checked out at 2PM, they held my luggage while i did some touring, and now at 9 they continue to let me use their facilities while i wait for my ride who is approximately 5 hours late.   without them i would literally be on the streets.

holy futuristic library batman! i think because my mom is a librarian i have a homing device for any and every library in every city i travel to. i just stumble upon them.   i came upon this branch as i wandered aimlessly through the metro center mall parking lot getting ogled and sweating like a leaky fire hydrant (mmm imagery!).  i asked about a guest pass to use the computers and was given a full use library card by a very friendly gentleman, whom, while he knew i was only here for a week, proceeded to detail the entire functionings of his branch and the other regional branches. he was enthusiastic so i didn't try to stop him.    the library is all bright yellows, reds and shiny steel. there are cool twists and turns of architecture and design and the computer equipment is very current and all of the staff members offered help since i looked so bedraggled.  if i didn't have tourist's guilt about actually going out and doing something, i would have stayed there all day reading.

i was a feeling a little abandoned in creepy town phoenix this morning - i just didn't know what to do with myself and had a weird experience at the mall...but it was getting to lunch time and i had no clue where to go so i stopped in at the library, got online and found this TJs. Thank god for Trader Joes! seriously.  This location is small but it felt like the aisles were a little wider and i just wanted to skip through ripping everything off the shelves.  you know how seeing a familiar face in a strange place makes you feel.  thank you Joe Joe for saving the day.   The staff was also very friendly not just with me, but everyone who was shopping there. maybe they're getting four stars because i was so hungry and alone, but damn it, they're worth it!

One can get rather museum'd out while traveling, but even if you're thinking "meh...natural history..." you should make it over to this museum.  This isn't a building filled with stuffed ducks and foxes, like most Natural History museums and I totally geeked out during my visit. I took photos. of ROCKS. man I love science!   AMNH is all about local natural history, dinosaurs and meteorites and it is fabulous! I had no idea about the awesome crystal caves in Arizona and all the wild meteor hits that have happened here. There was even an eye witness description of a meteor shower impact from a 100+ year old lady who was a kid when her town was shaken by the space rocks.   The center of the museum houses a particularly amusing display of automaton dinosaurs that growl and screech at each other, there are replicas of native american homes as well as some original pottery and best of all, a gold panning courtyard! Siv to your hearts content looking for gold in the man-made river before heading back inside to the Mars exploration exhibit.   Tthis is a small museum but a really rad one and if you are in the Valley you have to stop by. Don't forget your camera!

On my first outing to The Brow Lady I scheduled an eyelash tinting. I've been obsessing about it since 08 when my friend CJ met me in argentina with freshly tinted eyelashes and they were about a foot long and i was super jealous! I was somewhat skeptical about the success of tinting already dark lashes, but I have to say that Laura my aethetician (let's go with that spelling...) did a great job on my lashes.  The shop is very small, and wouldn't be able to withstand a large crowd of more than say, 3, but I like that about it and there was no competition for a seat in the waiting area so I lounged and flipped through mags while I waited. Laura was exceptionally friendly as soon as she came out of her previous appointment and ushered me into one of the two treatment rooms as she began explaining the whole tinting process. She outlined every step as she went along and was easy to talk to as I laid there blindly waiting for the tint to do its work.   I'm really pleased with the results: I look like I'm wearing mascara sans clumping and the lashes themselves look glossy and longer! Yay! Tinting is on special this summer, $20 down from $25. I didn't even know that when I scheduled the appointment so it was a generous surprise. I will totally go back to Laura now that I know she's there!

This is a really small storefront, and I was the only one inside so the owner (i'm guessing) kind of followed me around telling me about every single loaf. Usually that's cool with me but I kind of wanted to just look around without him standing at my shoulder. The idea that the bread is so naturally and healthily (that's a word, right?) made really appeals to me, and I was super impressed to see the pumpkin loaf that I picked up was made today! Today! When have you ever bought anything made the same day, from scratch?! Fantastic.   The cookies and cinnamon buns looked yummy too, and even though I really don't eat bread I really wanted a spelt rosemary foccaccia! And BB even has Unsweetened bread that is only 20 calories a slice (regular bread is about 70 -90).   I went ahead and bought a small pumpkin loaf for $4 (yikes!) and tried a piece when I got home. Delicious! It is melt in your mouth fluffy and silky, very pumpkiny and ohhhhhh...just...so...gooooood. I had some soy milk with it too and oohhhhh...just...so...gooooooooooood.

Atrocious. I mean, really atrocious. Now, I almost went with 2 stars because all of their servers were super friendly and attentive, but that could not remedy the offensive meal that they served me today.   The patio is very charming and I like how close all the tables are and it felt very charming, so I really didn't mind when they seated me at a dirty table and left me there unattended for about 5 minutes. After clearing it off I waited a few more minutes before having a menu presented...honestly I am not going to complain about the wait though because I was alone and waiting in a restaurant is more palatable when you are with someone else.   So anyway I wasn't super duper hungry but the veggie burrito cost almost as much as the enchiladas del mar, and i haven't had seafood in a while so i thought, "well, okay $9.25 enchiladas here I come." supposedly the meal was 3 enchiladas with crab and shrimp, rice and beans...and it included 2 sopapillas for dessert, which i don't like and didn't want, but you don't pay less for not having them, and they brought them anyway.  I had scoped out two guys across the way with really huge plates full of food, and thought at least if i was getting all that food i could take some home. That's why i was surprised when my plate was set down in front of me. I had three tiny cheese enchiladas that were not stuffed with crab and shrimp, but were topped with a few of those freaky teeny tiny shrimp and FAKE CRAB. those horrible whitefish composite crab legs that taste equally of tuna, eggs and white bread. I was stunned. Frank and Lupe's should be ASHAMED of themselves for serving this to paying customers for nine dollars.   How about the rest of the dish? Well, there was about 1 tablespoon of crusty rice (how rice can get crusty i don't even want to know) and an equal amount of beans that had no taste. not even bean taste. To add insult to injury the whole meal was swimming. a 1/4 in lake of oil-speckled water coated the bottom of the plate and i really can't even imagine why.   None of the food was hot and only when the "seafood" was pushed off my enchiladas was i able to choke them down. I know i should have sent this back and walk out. I know it. but I was so embarrassed, i could not believe that this was a meal I would end up paying $12 dollars for (including tip) and I just wanted to cry, scream, but mostly, get the hell out of there.   What a travesty to the name of Mexican food.

Wow, used clothes that don't smell like old people or fendi...where am i? Oh, My Sister's Closet, that's where. I didn't have much time to scour the racks when I was here the other day, but here are a few things I noticed:  a. great organization. the rack groupings are neat and easy to explore.  b. special section for designer items c. designer shoes in my size! oh mama!  d. cute purses and other brand new looking accessories  yeah, and i'm still thinking about the isaac mizrahi pumps i saw so i will probably go back.

This is a combined review of Elements and Jade bar, because I spent 6 hours here recently on an indulgent day of eating and drinking.  Two of us met for lunch on a Thursday at 12:30, and were almost entirely alone in the restaurant for the duration. Thusly, our service was impeccable.   We both started with an order of shishito peppers, the soup of the day which was a light creamy lobster and artichoke soup (!!!!!), and an order of edamame wontons. We split our entrees, the braised brisket sandwich and the turkey burger, both of which were tasty and filling.  During the course of the lunch we also enjoyed a glass of champagne each, a half bottle of Sancerre and a full bottle of Pinot Noir, which we ended up bringing over to Jade bar around 3:30pm.   Bartender Steve graciously welcomed us to the sparsely populated bar and we chatted about drink trends and we ordered our first round: for me the uva bella and for Kat, the dragon's tonic. I thought both were delicious. As the afternoon turned into evening we started telling Steve what liquors and or what flavors we liked and he started created off-menu drinks for us to taste test. That was dangerously delicious. By 5:30 the bar was packed and we were well into our third round. I finished up with a moscow mule with extra ginger in it that did not disappoint and then abandoned ship in favor of going home to hold onto the floor for dear life.   It was a spectacular day with great company and a great Sanctuary staff. I would be back at that bar in a minute for anything Steve wants to mix up, he is truly as talented as his predecessors.

TJ! I swear, seeing a TJ's when I arrive at a new place instantly makes me feel at home. I know it's a chain, so of course all the stores look the same, but I certainly don't get that warm fuzzy feeling for Target.   TJ's has very curious products. They have a very small produce section in comparison to the massive wall of cheese and prepackaged deli meats, and their real specialty is frozen food. That's all fine with me, I love their mini quiches, bag of tangerines and mozzarella sticks, not to mention the dark chocolate ginger (oh mama!), red pepper and eggplant tapenade, soymilk and blemish touch stick. Speaking of which, next time you are in there, eyeball their tiny cosmetic area, because i have found some really great deals that are organic, and who doesn't love that. Phthalate-free America!

oh mama! Natalie's review convinced me to try out seven sisters and we were NOT disappointed.  stopped by around 4PM on wednesday, we were a little surprised how far up on scottsdale it was, and that it was located in a small strip mall storefront, but everything inside was worth the drive.   the chocolate is the main focus - there are some shelves with knick knacks and packaged chocolate, but the fresh chocolate is resting happily on cake protected from my drooling by thick glass. we were the only patrons, so we had the full attention of our candy gal, a former bostonian by the way.    as we gazed wide eyed  and panted at her chocolate she offered us a free sample of the homemade fat free frozen yogurt they serve there. she gave us a heads up that it's actually made from yogurt, and you can taste the difference but it's really excellent and we were so convinced we decided to get a full cup. (a small is ENORMOUS by the way. and should be for $4.50)   here's what i got chocolate wise and my review:  mint chocolate: light chocolate layer on top of a mint layer (i'm guessing white chocolate...) on top of a dark chocolate layer. it's a small square but packs big minty punch which i simply adore. it's very dense and sort of hard, like a hershey bar hardness. that was my favorite.   peanut butter chocolate: this was an ice cube shaped chunk of homemade peanut butter with a dark chocolate coating. don't think reese's peanut butter cup, this pb was so light it literally dissolved on my tongue and i looked down at my hands wondering where the rest of it had gone because i wanted more. that was my favorite.  cherry bomb: dark chocolate dipped cherry twins. that was my favorite.  toffee: thick buttery toffee that was coated in milk chocolate embedded with fresh crushed nuts.  it wasn't the tooth breaking, stick in your molars kind of toffee either. it was glorious. that was my favorite.   my friend had a marshmallow topped with creamy caramel that was then drenched in chocolate. i almost ripped it out of her hands but it was gone too fast.  i even tried one of their sugar free selections, a cherry cordial and it was decent for sugar free.  i almost splurged on the chocolate dipped apricot but i thought i should probably save room for dinner. the apricot was about the size of my open palm. (why didn't i get it??!!)  god i wish i lived here.

Number 1: I wish this store were on the north side of Thomas because I find it hard to get in and out of. waaaah.  Number 2: I had not read the reviews about hot chicks shopping here before going to Albertson's but clearly that's why i was drawn there...clearly.  Has anyone else noticed that the Albertson's parking lot has spaces big enough for Hummers? I saw a Chevy Durango that didn't fill up its space and I had five-foot clearance on either side of my car. That is kind of weird but also really great.   Prices are average and the produce looks crisy and fresh. i went in not knowing what i wanted and coming out with a pretty healthy selection. Oh and I have to say that the Albertson's brand Mild salsa sold in the cases on the right in the produce area is actually really spicy. I usually take a Medium heat salsa but this mild is tasty. Maybe this is just my first experience with southwest food in the southwest.

To be clear: 4.5 stars   My first Yelp Eats restaurant was Atlas; frankly I wish I was spending the entire week there, oh the sacrifices I make for you Yelp. I was joined by Chrissy P and Andrew K whose reviews I'm sure you've already read. I've heard about Atlas endlessly from a friend of the owner Todd and this promotion made it that much more accessible.  Todd attended to us throughout the evening, though one of the chefs also came out to say hello to all of the diners.   Let me get my only two cons out of the way now: the corkage fee was $10 per bottle which I found a touch extravagant. Just a touch darling. Especially considering their dining room opens onto AZ Wine and the urge to pair wine with your dinner seems almost mandatory. Which brings me to point number two: I don't like that the restaurant opens on to AZ Wine. AZ Wine has a VERY different look and feel to it than Atlas Bistro and I would guess AZW benefits a lot more from the indoor entrance than Atlas.   Everything else about the dinner and service was 5 star, for sure. I opted for the additional fourth course (a starter) for $40 instead of 3 courses for $25, and this prices are ridiculously slashed compared to their normal $55 and $60. Not that the food isn't worth $60, because it is. All I'm saying is GO THERE IMMEDIATELY! You only have 3 days left!!!   I started with the duck breast over mushroom risotto and the duck was quite rare, gamey and delightful. I'm told this is one of the only dishes that has been on the menu since Atlas opened seven years ago. The second course was smoked salmon over a pureed potato cake and my response to that is yum yum yum. The salmon had a great texture, was not overly salty and melted in my mouth. The potato cake was made from angel's breath and clouds. I think I'm in love. For my third course I tried the grouper over melon and red quinoa. The grouper was amazing, moist, large flaking, and deliciously seared on top and bottom which lended the loveliest crunch. I wasn't in love with the melon quinoa salad, the grouper had an orange glaze that was quite pronounced and the melon was extremely ripe and heady and it was just too much sweet for me. Not that I stopped eating it or anything. I chose the cheese plate for dessert and smacked away all the little hands that tried to grab at my granite slab of yum. Three cheeses, almonds, prune and apricot puree, baguette and a flatbread crisp as well as chocolate chips, strawberry quarters and blueberries.   At the end of our meal Todd offered us free corkage for our next visit which sealed the deal. I will be back. And when I do I'm sure I will follow up with a 5 star update!

This is my favorite restaurant in the whole valley. I have eaten here so many times over the past two years I could not possibly list all the delightful meals I have enjoyed.  I have never ever left here hungry, I don't think it's possible, frankly.  The chefs create artistic masterpieces in that small kitchen, using regional proteins and veggies, creating pates, jellies and cured meats in house, and even selling their delicious selection of cheeses retail out of the AZ Wine side of the shop.   I highly recommend grabbing a bottle of wine and heading over there for an amazing meal.

Well that's settled then: I'm moving to Arizona. for a vegetarian restaurant. I love real veg restaurants, they are so few and far between all those places that just serve a veggie wrap and think they are opening up their client base. You can tell Green is the real deal because they list chicken sandwiches, meatballs this, shaved beef that all without blinking.  I went for the original g spicy po'boy and the tahini coleslaw (say what?), followed by a small tsoynami...and perhaps a mini chocolate peanut butter bar. what, it's all health food right?   the po'boy, i will admit looked a little "po" with only 3 pieces of spicy chicken, but the flavor was great and i even thought (mayonnaise hater that I am) that the vegan mayo added to the flavor and richness of the sandwich. the coleslaw was just delightful, and i would never have been able to tell that my soft serve was vegan in a blind taste test.  i just saw Eric's review about the mint syrup and chocolate chips, so i'm heading back there for an after-dessert dessert.  the atmosphere is spare, i feel like they could toss a few more tables in there, on the left side where the tables were really far away from one another. There was cool soft music, and I liked that they have two sofas to chill on, and a mini market full of vegan goodies like meatless beef jerky and paul newman's pretzels.    Oh Green, you and I have such good times ahead of us...please bring napkins.

I ate lunch here today and it was really fantastic! Besides an extensive regular menu, Tonto has a vegan and gluten free menu...yummmm. I started with the caprese salad which had three fresh mozzarellas (ancho chili, sage, hibiscus) made on site paired with three thick slices of heirloom tomato and micro sage. My cousin suggested their spaghetti squash (a side) to share and it was delicious! It is seasoned with grilled onion and tossed with wilted spinach...so good! My meal was a torta with layers of mashed anasazi beans, green chiles, chopped tomatoes, mashed sweet potatoes and a bunch of other stuff and was accompanied by whole grain baked crackers. It was a great blend of textures in the torta and all the flavors mixed seamlessly. My cousin had an ahi tuna roll that looked like it had been covered in tempura - she loved it.   The flavors of everything we tried really stood out. I would go back in a second!

I LOVE TAPAS. Firefly makes creative and super delicious tapas and one of my friends had been hesistant to make the trip out to Firefly and repented for the rest of the night because the food was sooooo good.  Here's what we ate (groaning and rolling our eyes loudly in delight):  *ceviche of shrimp - I'm not gonna lie, 8.50 for 1/3 cup of ceviche makes me sad, but the flavors were great so I slurped it up.  *tortilla espanola - classic and delicious. if you go to a tapas bar with no tortilla espanola, leave immediately.   *roasted eggplant cannelloni - ultra-thin slices of eggplant that were lightly charred and stuffed with goat's cheese. what else can I tell you?!  *stuffed peppers - WOW! so simple and yet sooooo decadent. mama loves cheese, garlic and peppers so this was basically my fave.  *manchego mac & cheese - in my mouth please.   *albondigas - my friends and I all lived in Seville together and have many not-so-fond memories of greasy albondigas, these were a nice surprise but I wouldn't get them again I guess. PTSD or what have you.   Frankly I wanted to keep eating until the kitchen ran out of food. I would have continued on with the roasted squash soup, the veggie empanada, patatas bravas, artichoke toasts, smoked salmon platter, okay and basically the entire rest of the menu.   This place isn't as ornate as Boston's Dali, but these tapas are scrumptious and worth a cab ride even if you're just in town to party. Trust me.

last night a friend and i stopped by tapino because of all the great reviews here and we were very pleased at the choice.  We barely made it to happy hour in the vino lounge, but the server was very friendly and even gave us a last call 5 minutes before 7PM so we could order a second round.  for $45 we shared 4 glasses of wine and 5 tapas, which ended up being the perfect sized meal for two girls who'd just eaten about a pound of chocolate. (see seven sisters review!)   the yucca frites with argentinian chimmi churri were a highlight for us. much denser than potato fries, they had a creamier texture and the chimmi churri was delicious.  we also tried 3 different cheeses all of which were excellent, and the eggplant cannelloni which was good but nothing to write home about.   the wine lounge is an outdoor deck draped with white curtains and white couches and ottomans, it is very chic but unpretentious and we had a great time! there wasn't a crowd of people outside, which was nice, but of course it was only a wednesday evening.  we hung out until 9ish then walked around the strip mall before heading out.   calm atmosphere, friendly staff throughout, comfortable seating and yummy food. the wine wasn't bad either.  delightful!

Phoenix libraries are crazy yo. I come from an area where libraries are quaint, hushed, puritanical affairs so when I approached Burton Barr I thought 'welcome to the thunderdome, max.' This place looks like it could take off and shoot into space, for real.   The real gem is the sheer volume of books. I came looking for tomes on wine studies and left with 13 books. Can I possibly even read that many in three weeks? The aisles are wide and well lit, there is loads of natural light filling each high-ceiling-ed floor and the librarians are quite friendly and helpful.   I didn't linger because my stack was weeble wobbling everywhere but what a cool place to come back and just get lost in.

"Upscale fast food"? Seriously? And these other reviews...am I the only person hating on Chipotle? Today I went to Chipotle for the first time - I actually thought it was a restaurant until now. 6.50 for a vegetarian burrito (which has no vegetables in it) is just ridiculous, and...and I don't even know. Chipotle Mexican Grill?! Seriously? I am dumbfounded that this place exists and that people eat here. I mean, there was nothing "wrong" with it, it is just the epitome of our generic fast food culturally void society.    wow. I seriously hate me some chipotle.

Yum! You know you're in trouble when you get hungry and immediately log on to yelp to find out where you are going to eat. But you haven't done me wrong yelp, in recommending Pita Jungle.   Today I had a lunch of baba ghanoush and the pita pizza. There was plenty of BG left for me to take home, but the pizza was gone in almost an instant. Let's not debate this in the classic Chicago vs New York style, this is a pita with pizza toppings on it, not brain surgery. But the ingredients were what made the meal. FRESH. the spinach was not previously frozen, the tomatoes were firm and juicy, the mushrooms were not out of a can! there was a touch of feta, and just the right pizza spices.   It was small, pita bread small, but that's cool, just because I want to eat like a pig doesn't mean I should...all of the assorted staff who approached me were friendly and the service was quick. I will be back for falafel, for pesto pizza, for the macro platter and a couple of the other sandwiches that looked good.

I'm moving in. The end. This is the most authentic shop (of any variety) that I've seen since I moved to Arizona. It reminds me of the mercados I used to hit up in VA in that it has everything, hookahs to religious art, and of course food.   The bakery was a mystery to me. I pointed at a few things, have since tried two of them, and I have no idea what they are. But I like them. There is a huge section devoted to turkish delights, as I sadly found out after making my purchases. Great cheeses! Massive quantities of dried fruits, nuts, olives and canned meats.   If you see me brushing my teeth in aisle 4, please don't mess up my cot in aisle 2. Thanks.

Dudes. I spent half an hour at 1804 E Southern Ave looking for Taco del Mar and could not find it. supposedly it is in the same complex as the yoga studio and nutrition center, both of which i did find. I was totally jonesing for a taco but alas, left the Basha's strip mall quite unfulfilled.   Perhaps Taco del Mar is one of those 'members only' places, or an old timey speakeasy but with tacos. Or was there simply an invisibility cloak thrown over it yesterday? I don't know, but I am still craving a good taco.

oooohh i'm teetering on a 5 star review...we'll see how that pans out. I arrived for dinner at MTR around 530PM yesterday and the place was full, with no indoor seating left. I sat outside, somewhat reluctantly because christ it is cold outside and i thought this was arizona and i would be hot all the time but i wish i had a fleece jumpsuit right now...  anyway. I went ahead and ordered the mandala masala, an indian inspired dinner with garbanzo beans, veggies and small-chopped potatoes over brown rice with a side of steamed spinach. The scents wafting out of the front door were just intoxicating, and when my dinner arrived it smelled equally as appetizing. The taste was on par, minus the dry flavorless brown rice that may have been a bit stale. I would say that $14 is a bit much for the size of the meal but on the whole I was satisfied.   I ordered a piece of vegan chocolate raspberry cake for dessert and it was good enough to write a movie about. romantic comedy i mean. first off, it was huge and just...just...perfect...sigh. secondly, the frosting was that thick dense style, and it was the perfect frosting-to-cake ratio, with just that hint of raspberry glaze mixed in.    well i couldn't talk this up to a 5 star rating, but I will eat as many slices of chocolate cake as it takes to get it there! (estimate: a whole cake)

I work so close to Wildfish it's truly a crime I hadn't been there before the Yelp Elite event last week. Oh.my.gosh.   Seafood is my kryptonite and Wildfish nearly laid me out. The crabcakes? I think I saw those...they were ripped from the hands of the servers before they could plant both feet out on the patio! The Ahi Tuna was amazing, so creamy with a hint of sesame oil (?)...mmmmmm. I bee-lined it to the oyster bar and tried to get them all in my mouth before anyone else noticed they were there.  The prawns were EEE-normous and even the endive with mushrooms and goat cheese was delightful. I liked my lemondrop enough to have two!   I see another review here about a chopped salad and 75 cent oysters so there's no way the Wildfish staff can get rid of me now!

this reminds me of the ghetto mall from my home town...very...abandoned.  i came by here in the AM in search of a pair of cheap flip flops for my vacation.  as i walked across the parking lot a creepy car was passing by and slowed down to take a look at me.  first the dude just said hi, started to drive away and then stopped and tried to call me over.  i walked a little faster so i could get inside.  there's a macy's and a dillard's in here, so i wouldn't consider it a complete failure, but you know you're on a downward spiral when there's a Fredricks of Hollywood with a Bling Bling stall right outside.   they had an old navy though, and god knows old navy makes cheap ass flip flops, so i was set.

Call me a communist, but I love sharing books, music and movies. I am ALWAYS at this library either wandering aimlessly for hours or running in to pick up great items on hold.    Scottsdale is really lucky that a lot of it's taxes get thrown to the public library system, especially when most libraries are reducing staff and operational hours. Even their website is great, highlighting a ton of literary collections you might not think of.  For instance, they are supporting local authors with their "Read Local" promotion, and this week the site has a selection of Banned Books that are must-reads!   Also check out the website for an endless stream of events and programs including writing workshops, book clubs, and even free entrepreneurial business seminars!   Libraries make paying taxes worthwhile.

OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.  A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.  We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.  About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.  The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.  Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.  Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.  Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, "we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.  About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The "live scallops" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.  Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. "Next" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. "oh your next course is ready!" "we don't want it. We want to leave" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu "wants us to have them." We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.  Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, "Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower." We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me "if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it." I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.

Oh I am SO disappointed! Over the last week in June I scoped out four area bike shops in search of my very first bicycle. During that time I went to Bicycle Haus where I spoke with Shasta, the owner about what I was looking for in a bike and what my budget was. She was great and immediately pointed me in the direction of the Specialized Carmel I, giving me loads of reasons it would be the perfect bike for me. When I saw the price tag I relayed my budget concerns and she said "You know, we can make it work for you," and then helpfully talked me through all the accessories that I would need to have a safe, pleasant ride. I told her my time frame to buy was about three weeks later, thanked her very much and went on my way. After visiting the other 3 shops I still liked my experience with BH the best and was also pleased with it's proximity to my house which would make getting there for tune ups and future supply needs extremely easy.   Fast forward selector: I walk in on a Tuesday, just to talk to someone about renting the bike before I bought it, and was pointed to John (Shasta wasn't there) and we talked briefly about the model, purchasing and renting. I was a little put off by him because even though there were three other guys working there, he would leave me to go answer the phone and ring up other customers. Come on dude, let's focus on customer service here. I decided to go back a few days later to speak with Shasta again directly.   When I went in two days later, Shasta was there but didn't remember me, nor attended to me. I found John who also had a hard time remembering who I was FROM TWO DAYS AGO and we went over all the things I would need again and I told him flat out that Shasta had told me we could make my budget work with this specific bike. He stood there looking at me blankly, pointed to the price tag and said, "well I don't know what she told you but the price is $450." Then I asked him if he would put together an invoice so I could see exactly how much all of this was going to cost me.  More blank staring, then he told me he didn't know how so he left me at the counter just waiting for someone else to help me. Shasta attended to a few other people who were milling around and then said she could do the proposal for me. Still no recognition. After we went through everything the price was almost $200 more than I could spend! I walked out extremely frustrated.   I'm sure you could explain away not remembering me, but I work in a similar small, specialized industry and even if I don't remember names I always remember faces and frankly in this economy I don't believe that Bicycle Haus has a ton of people coming in looking to purchase their first bike right now. I find both John and Shasta's behavior very off-putting and very disappointing. I am all for supporting small businesses and ESPECIALLY women-owned businesses but there's no way I would ever recommend Bicycle Haus to a novice rider/shopper based on my very Jekyl and Hyde experiences.

After dim summing at the Chinese Cultural Complex and the Great Wall in Phoenix, I feel confident declaring this the Valley winner for Dim Sum. I've been here a number of times over the years and have had a delicious experience each time. The key is to get there before 11:00AM so you don't have a long wait. Any time after 11:15AM pretty much guarantees the place will be packed to the brim.  Also, they run out of snowballs after 11:00AM and that is pretty much the most awesome pastry ever. PPB has loads of carts roaming around so you are never without food, and the prices are great. Obviously the bigger your party the lower your bill will be, no matter how much more you order. It's dim sum insanity!   Seriously, who can eat 'regular' chinese food again after a healthy dose of steamed dumplings, soups, chicken feet and light fluffy pastries?   Do yourself a favor and make the drive to Phoenix Palace Buffet!

I was doing a grocery store tour yesterday and went into Food City for some dinnertime inspiration. First of all, it is a bad sign to get out of your car and smell next door's indian food restaurant from halfway across the parking lot. i love indian food but that was gross.   This location has a sad sad inventory. The produce looked decent and the store seemed clean except for peeling paint on the walls. The back wall, which in most stores is the Dairy department, was actually a wall of junk food. I guess that's more a sad commentary on society than Food City. The whole store was really chock-full of cheap junky food, and the only inspiration I found was their great mexican food aisles with delicious looking tortillas and everything else you would need to prepare a wonderful mexican dinner. unfortunately i am not cooking in my hotel room so i left empty-handed.

Super shuttle can rot in hell. I made an online reservation, pre-paid and was super psyched about the great $14 rate that would get me to my hotel. my plane came in early, but i had to wait for my bags at baggage claim so i was about 10 minutes late for my 9:35PM pickup.    I go outside and am directed to the super shuttle dispatcher guy who i walk up to.  he half turns towards me but refuses eye contact as they are glued to the company cell phone that is scrolling something on the screen.  "hi i have a reservation, my name is erin..." he takes a deep breath and asks again how i spell my last name and says "yeah yeah 5 minutes" and promptly walks away from me.   now my name is generally difficult for people to spell, and i didn't get the sense he'd actually been listening, but i moved aside and took the opportunity to stretch my legs. a van pulls up about five minutes later. driver gets out, says one man's name, the man gets on and they drive away.  another van pulls up. i ask the guy if it's the one i'm supposed to get on and he puts his hand up to indicate i should stop talking. umm okay.   so now it's 10:20 (!!!!) and that dude goes on break when his coworker comes back. his coworker who just smoked an entire blunt.  more vans are coming and going, yelling out street names and people just hop on. well i don't frigging know what street my hotel is near wtf?!  at 10:30 i approach the stoner and ask him when my shuttle is arriving.  his first question: "did the other guy help you?" i can sense that if i say yes he will immediately walk away. i say no. he looks up my reservation and oh magical, no one called it in when i got to the stand 40 minutes ago. wow. spectacular. so i tell him the other guy told me five minutes, and that i have a reservation and he goes "there are no reservations and i thought you said no one helped you".  AAAAYYYYYYYYYYY!! after he tells me i will have to wait an ADDITIONAL 45 MINUTES i call the 800 number to have a screaming fit, and that dude calls the stoner and asks him what's up and the stoner says i'm annoying and then i am told yet again that there are no reservations.  no reservations? i ask. why did i get a confirmation, pick up time schedule and pre-pay online then? hmmmm?? no response to that but after a brief hold i'm told i can get on a bus in 15 minutes.    i got to my hotel at 11PM. sure it's a $14 ride, but that's not right.

Vietnamese food is so comforting and Noodles Ranch has never failed me in the value/meal size ratio so I think they deserve a solid 4 stars. I just had my second take out lunch from NR yesterday, a huge order of Pho (P7 with broccoli and bok choy, $1 extra for tofu) that I wasn't even able to finish.   When you order take out the Pho comes in a styrofoam cup, the sprouts, jalapeno, basil, siracha and lime are in a baggy, and the noodles and tofu are in the takeout box. I had to separate about half of the broth out of the cup because it was filled to the brim and there was no room for the other goodies. Then I went to work adding all my treats and created a massive pho that was just spicy enough with the little cup of siracha. No I will say that the siracha has some brown sauce mixed in, like soy sauce or something with high sugar (fish sauce?). I wasn't wild about the sweetness that lingered because of that.   What more can I say? It filled and warmed my belly, burned my esophagus and staved off my 'i haven't eaten lately' crankiness.

I was craving a treat so I came by OSN for an afternoon smoothie. First of all, I love the way you can really custom order your smoothie. Yogurt, milk, soy milk, or orange juice. They have loads of fruit flavors but I will say that I was a little disappointed that they use the Oasis fruit concentrate syrups instead of frozen fruit. Then there are the add-ins: immunity boost, ginseng, protein, fat burner, flaxseed oil and more.   The smoothie i ordered (soy milk with mango-raspberry) was soooo yummy (and huge)! I started off on the frequent smoothie-er card too, though I think this will be a somewhat infrequent treat because of the fruit syrups. Still, I like the One Stop Nutrition can quench my sweet tooth in a somewhat healthier way, and leave me feeling full for hours!

I've only had one session with Dr. Sherman but I feel 99% better already! I'm no Iron(wo)man by any means, but almost two weeks ago I injured myself at the gym and have been in pain ever since. A massage and multiple ice packs later and the pain is still lingering, so I talk to my personal trainer about solutions. She suggested Dr. Sherman and I set up an appointment for this morning (Nov 30). Dr. Sherman went through my written history with me and both talked to me about the injury and did a few tests to see how my muscles responded.   He practices A.R.T. an acronym that's full name I can't remember but it means moving muscles and deep pressure 'massage' to release spasms. Some of it was painful but most of it felt great, such a relief from the dull pain I'd been living with. He also adjusted my spine in a few places and then used those little electro-stimulating pads on my back to warm up the muscles. As soon as I stood up I could tell I was on the road to recovery. My neck and left shoulder don't hurt at all and my back is almost entirely pain-free as well.   Dr. Sherman is busy busy busy, but I was able to schedule a follow up in the next few days and he says that only 3 sessions will be necessary to straighten me out. I also asked about some ancillary tests and he is going to look into it for me. Most importantly I feel like he's honest; I self-pay all my medical bills and I don't feel like he's trying to squeeze extra dollars out of my wallet.   I'm so happy I can't wait to go back!

I like cupcakes regardless of their popularity; you can do all sorts of things with them (decorations, build a pyramid) and they fit right in your hand, and are filling for their size. I've had some good cupcakes in my time. Sprinkles isn't on that list.  See I think that Sprinkles, as a company, doesn't really like cupcakes. I think they like the fact that they can bank on a fad. Their shop is very scene-y, which is the antithesis of the happy cupcake times I want to experience. Its the kind of place an anoerexic would go and gaze fondly at the cupcakes and then leave not having eaten anything.   I went in and was immediately greeted by multiple employees, and was explained their rotating cupcake stocking system and told that their red velvet cupcakes were the most popular. I asked them if they used real beets to color the chocolate cake...they just gaped at me, then each other. Finally someone came up with "...noo, we use red food coloring." well thrilling. FYI European studies are consistently showing that a number of red food dyes interact with children's endocrine systems causing migraines and ADHD symptoms and Red #3 has even caused tumors in mice!   Anyway the magic of red velvet is the earthy play the beets offer, not just the color so I skipped that and when for Lemon Ginger. $3.51 is $3.51, but this better be a really good cupcake. Here we go: the frosting has the only flavor...lemon extract that is. It is sweet the way I like my frosting but a little crunchy and crystallized from sitting out all day. The cake was like moist cardboard. I mean that in the best way of course - the cake was fine but had zero taste. That was where I was expecting the ginger kick. When I finished it I realized that I was expecting ginger the root, when the real goal was the ginger flavor of boxed cakes which are two totally different worlds.   In the end I want a cupcake that tastes like someone made it with love...not necessarily love for ME, but love for cupcakes in general. Sprinkles is the McDonalds of cupcakes.

I visited the petroglyphs at Deer Valley today; I am sooo impressed! The building is unassuming and looks pretty vacant inside at first glance. But the information in center is really thoughtful, homespun and introspective. It's also fast moving because the staff knows you want to get outside and see those rocks!  The outdoor path to the basalt rock mound is wide and clear, though a little scary with all it's "rattlesnake habitat" signs. I'm not gonna lie: the petroglyphs are awesome. There are about 1500 images scattered across the rocky hill, and it seems like they are all facing the same side. It appears that the hill and the the rocks were very important to the people who carved these images and many present day tribes claim symbolism that pertains to their culture is found on the rocks, so maybe it was important for more than one group. My guess is the location was important because it was related to some ancient volcanic activity; that is how basalt is formed.   Anyway, totally rad reserve and museum and clearly i'm a huge geek. the end.

Wow. Wow. Wow. My Pure experience was awe-inspiring, and singular to be sure. Chrissy, Dottsy, Mike and I stopped by Pure (per the recommendation of my boss) on a Saturday evening at 645PM. The restaurant was nearly empty; apparently posh scottsdalites like to eat at 9PM. We slid into a booth just across from the chef's workspace and pondered the immense menu for a while. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks ordered while we decided. Finally, delusional from hunger, Mike whispered the magic words, sending Dottsy and I into ecstasy: chef's choice.   The Chef was feeling effusive that evening and we were quickly served a 2 foot long serving plate of sashimi loaded with halibut, octopus, tuna, scallop, and salmon. Everything was so fresh I swear I could see it twitching. Just moments later a *massive* platter arrived with six rolls.  I cannot remember the details of each roll, but suffice it to say everything was unique and perfectly crafted. I didn't use a single drop of soy sauce the whole night it was so delicious.   Somehow, after all that, we wanted more, and the chef brought out three more rolls, one of which was baked and topped with gorgeous mushrooms in a tangy sweet brown sauce. Our server commented that none of these rolls were on the menu, just something the chef thought up. We were also served dessert which we attempted halfheartedly, as we were now full to the brim on aquatic delicacies.   I didn't see the bill, so I can't speak to the pricing, but the meal was everything I could have dreamt of in a sushi feast, so for special occasions (those happen weekly, right?) I will definitely make my way back to Pure.

Holy home store! This is a fantasy land of interior decorating, so many shiny sparkly things to distract and tempt me...Luckily I reach for the price tag of said shiny sparkly item and am scorched back into reality by their pricing.   Today I zipped in and out of TGI on a front door handle search with my cousin. She found what she was looking for, though nearly wept at the price. I did too and it wasn't even my wallet. I noticed the door handle my own mother recently purchased at home depot at an already aburd $119 was on the shelf at the Great Indoors for $165, and as we pulled our box down an employee mentioned that if we bring it back there is a RESTOCKING FEE. Are you freakin' kidding me?   So wander to your hearts content but only buy what you absolutely must have.

I went to Roka Akor last night for a belated birthday celebration (mine) with my bosses. It was during Yelp Eats Week which meant when we arrived with no reservation we were told our only option was to eat at the sushi bar. Fine with me!   The first thing we all noticed was that we had no server established until about an hour into our meal. Four people randomly attended to us until our appetizers showed up and then Charles came over and said he would be our server.  Also, two of us had arrived first, and one of the first people to approach us was a woman with two towels to wash our hands. Except they weren't warm. I have never ever had a cold wet towel handed to me in a Japanese restaurant, and Kat said every other time she's been here they've been warm. When Kate arrived a few minutes later, no one offered her a towel at all. Rad.   We waited for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us about drinks, and then we didn't know who to grab to ask about appetizers. We did finally get the opportunity to order the butterfish appetizer, and when Kate asked for the seafood and vegetable tempura, she specifically asked if only one shrimp came with the order could they please add 2 more. The server seemed very confused and said he would have to ask the chef. Come on this isn't brain surgery people, add 2 shrimp, jesus.    One of my bosses ordered a beef dish for her main course which she enjoyed except that they left significant chunks of gristle on the meat. The other ordered the miso cod which was completely perfect and something I would specifically seek out if and when I return to Roka. I ordered the 3 sashimi chef's selection and for $17 dollars I was presented with a huge bowl of ice and approximately one ounce of fish, 2 slices of scallop, 2 slices of the 'cheap' tuna, and 2 slices of salmon. The scallop was fine, the tuna was a bit spongy but the salmon was gorgeous.  Kate had also ordered a mushroom rice pot which didn't make it to our table for an additional 25 minutes. And for some reason, they didn't leave the pot at the table for us, which Kate said they normally do, as the pot serves 6 to 8 people, and we'd only had one small plate of it each. I was in the restroom for the delivery and plating of the rice so I didn't even see the size of it.  But I think it's extremely rude to pull a half-full dish without asking.   Charles brought me a scoop of strawberry passionfruit sorbet with a candle in it which was very thoughtful but I wasn't wild about it and ordered the orange flourless cake with rose petal cream and raspberries for dessert. That was very good, probably the highlight of the evening.  Kate had ordered a nectarine shochu ($14) that arrived in a 6oz tumbler with a 4oz rock of ice in it and only 2 ounces of actual shochu. She was extremely disappointed with the shochu flavor which was not nectarine at all, more of a grapefruit gasoline. We called Charles back and showed him the ice to shochu ratio discrepancy and he kindly removed it from the table and our bill.   Both bosses have been to Roka a number of times and said this was not a typical experience for the restaurant. And this was a Wednesday! That makes me believe Roka think it's cool to offer up sub-par service during promotional menus, even to those not interested in the promo. I would go back for the butterfish and the cod if someone insisted, but I can get a better quality and value for sushi at Yen over on 43rd Ave.  The evening was at least saved with great company and conversation.

Yay for Bomberos's anniversary event! I stopped by last night, meeting up with the party Christina P organized around 6PM. All of the hostesses and servers were really friendly and personable and I found the Yelpers quickly. The outdoor patio is just delicious; stone and gravel with mesquite trees and potted plants all circled around a big fire pit that gave a glowing ambience to the whole evening.    The glass wine prices were perhaps a little higher than I like to pay...especially because their south american wines are readily available by the bottle what they were charging for a glass. Of course I got a 50% discount for the anniversary party, but otherwise I think I would just as soon buy a whole bottle and stay the entire afternoon and evening lounging on their couches.  But the wine list was nicely varied for all tastes and they had Cusquena beer which is just absurdly fun.   I ordered a veggie panini for $10 and thought it was a bit light on the actual veggies, but really tasty nonetheless. Again, at 50% I would not complain.  For a real $10 sandwich I would like to see quarters of artichoke, not just choppy bits.   On my way out I saw that they offer breakfast and I think it would be so cool to brunch there! And to see their full lunch and dinner menu. Yeah, I will be back, for sure.

On Sunday I made my way up to Cave Creek to go hiking and found myself in one of the loveliest settings I've seen in a while. The reserve is endless, there are loads of trails of varying distances and difficulties and all are clearly laid out on the free map provided at the entrance. My cousin and I made our way up the Tortuga trail to get a clear view of Elephant Mountain and then along the first half of the Spur Cross Trail. There was a HUGE group of hikers who'd arrived just before us, and we found out that rangers offer free guided hikes throughout the reserve. The group was testing out the newly opened Dragonfly Trail which branches off Spur Cross and heads southwest.   Cave Creek is verdant this time of year, which is a stark contrast to what I've seen in East Scottsdale lately and I even saw some new plants I couldn't identify. And on our way back down the Spur Cross trail we spotted a gila monster (see photos) and it was totally scary and rad all at the same time. I will definitely be back to explore more of this reserve this spring!

My bosses have brought in late afternoon snacks of humble pie a few times now and I've enjoyed it all! I've never stepped foot in here, nor noticed whilst driving through Scottsdale, so clearly I won't speak to parking, service, atmosphere.   I've had the Margherita, the local veggie one, and most recently the potato and gorgonzola pie. That has been the most decadent so far, the fingerling potatoes are really sweet and tender and the rosemary adds a great savory flavor. I didn't get a strong sense of the gorgonzola, which I love in general, but the size of the pie is perfect and the crust was firm but chewy in the middle and an all around treat.

Yum! Dottsy, Mike and Ayesha included me on an Indian run last Thursday and I'm soooo glad we tried Indian Paradise. It is forever away (okay maybe only 12 miles from my place) but I was up by Hayden anyway.  At 7PM on a Thursday there were only half a dozen other diners sprinkled around the fairly sparse room. I have to say it seems a bit cavernous and light on the decor. Whatever, I'm there to EAT, not to redecorate, so let's get to the main event.   We started with Pakora, which were different looking from the pakora I've had before, tasted fine though. I ordered the Mutter....Mutter...crap I can't remember the name. It was mushrooms and peas in a creamy delicious sauce. I have never seen it before and it was so good I didn't want to share. I also had yellow lentil soup which was decent, and I managed to try the Dal Mahkani (christ I'm bad with names), and the Cauliflower and pea dish. All very standard Indian dishes, familiar by taste if not by name (clearly...)  and all executed classically.  As I tucked into these delights I realized it has been such a long time since I last had Indian food and now that I'm typing this a week later I realize I'm craving it again.   Our server was very polite and just attentive enough and the food came out really quickly which was great because I wanted to eat my fist at that point. I have to say that the prices were great, because I didn't pay. Thanks Mike! But I had noticed very reasonable price tags on the menu so this will be my go-to place for solid Indian from now on.

Fine's represents the best of what a wine shop can be but also what is held over from the old wine snob mentality.  First the positives:   Fine's is both shopping and dining. Wine is meant to be enjoyed with food. As much fun as it is to pop a straw in an open wine bottle (not that i've ever done that...) wine is a culinary complement; so i like the idea that you can buy wine that you had with a meal there and enjoy it again at home!   Having Drop in Wine Tastings, Chef's Table wine pairing dinners and wine classes are my favs! I was a big oenophile back in Boston and multiple wine shops knew me by name.  I can see that happening here.   The not-so-hots:  Well the drop in wine tastings cost $5. I missed this Thursdays so I don't know how rotund the tasting is, but I am rather used to free wine tastings so that might keep me away in these salad days. Maybe they should refund the $5 if you buy a bottle from the tasting.  Because they have both retail and dining space, they had to compromise...and the retail side lost out. I was in there ten minutes before I found the Chilean wines. The wines in the center racks are all French and Californian and the other wine growing regions are on dark shelves along the wall like unloved stepchildren.   And finally...pricing. Look the truth is that the nose, mouthfeel and aging techniques between an $10 wine and a $25 are all but undectable to the average wine drinker and all the wines in here are pretty pricey. Yeah I could spend $45 bucks on a mind blowing wine but maybe I just want something cheap and decent. I feel like Fine's needs to highlight their economic wines, because I couldn't find any under $15.   Fine's gets 4 stars for their community interaction attempts, and their nice staff who will greet you but not follow you around forcing you to buy a bottle. But they need some work before they earn that last star.

After an absolutely horrifying lunchtime meal, I ran straight to Fine's for a glass of wine, or a hundred, to cleanse my palette and hopefully get myself drunk enough to not remember that i ate at all.   As it was only 2PM Fine's wasn't busy...at all. heh, daytime drinking is apparently relegated only to the unemployed! Well that's fine with me, i bellied up to the bar where Joshua and Merrill (hope I spelled it right) took excellent care of me. their "what would you like to drink?" was met with a "a bottle of wine, with a straw in it" so they went ahead and offered me a tasting flight of both white and red french wines.   All the while we talked about wine, they gave me some background about the SW wine growing region, and even let me sample one or two other wines they were offering another couple that came in.   I finished drowning my sorrows in a glass of sparkling wine from NM and Merrill presented me with an $11 dollar bill. Say WHAT?! Tuesdays in December are EXTRA Happy Hour days, because everything on their wine list (by the glass) is 50% off! So my flight was only $7 and my bubbly only $3.25. Amazing. Turns out that on Mondays the food is 50% off. And anyway, Fine's offers daily happy hour from 11AM - 7PM where they have a list full of $5 wines. imagine coming in on Tuesday and getting wine for $2.50!   Make sure to say hi to me when you stop by, as I will be permantly installed at the bar....

I tasted Breadfruit's sweet potato bread pudding for the first time at this years West of Western. (and then a second, third and fourth time until they asked me to stop eating all of their samples...) So when contemplating restaurants for my birthday dinner Breadfruit was at the top of a very short list.   Since I work in wine I think Breadfruit's BYOB policy is fantastic. Ignore anyone on here who complains about the $5 corkage fee because the markup most restaurants put on a bottle of wine is well over five bucks (usually it's 2-3 times what they paid!).  Plus BYOB allows you to bring exactly what you want to complement your meal (I would suggest a dry riesling, gewurztraminer or an un-oaked chardonnay).   The menu is small but there were plenty of options, even for vegetarians! I would have happily eaten everything from the appetizers section, but my dining pals and I set our sights on the plaintain avocado spring roll that is baked, not fried! I thought it was a creamy slice of deliciousness, and the accompanying chutney did not disappoint. My main dish was the Bok Choy and Mashed Sweet Potato....alright I've spent about 5 minutes sitting here staring at the screen because I don't know how to describe how great my meal was. Here's an idea: YUM. oh my gosh it was delicious, each ingredient and seasoning was a perfect and direct complement to all the rest. It was filling too, I mean, bok choy and mashed potatoes, that sounds like two side dishes to a "real" meal, but this meal is the real deal. Finally, I went ahead and ordered the bread pudding again for dessert, it's just dense and lightly sweet and so satisfying. mmmm.   Breadfruit's staff were very friendly and attentive and Daryl even came over to check on us at the end of the meal. The dining room wasn't crowded but we were being very loud (per usual) and no one seemed to mind in the least. What a great experience and delightful setting for a group of friends to celebrate the year's most important date: my birthday.

Geisha A Go Go is an awesome, inspired location for a birthday party. Specifically the private Karaoke room, but the whole bar is pretty cool. There is a random rock in the middle of the bar, which I'm convinced has more to do with tripping up drunks than it does feng shui.  Drink menu highlights include Sakes and Sou-chus, loads of asian beers, and cocktails that look AWESOME (I haven't gotten drunk here, tragic!). Harajuko Lover? Yes please!  The Karaoke room is sweet, though the location of the pole is awkward and people sitting on the couches need to watch out for wildly flailing body parts as their drunk friends work it out. Maybe that's half the fun?   All in all a solid bet for a guaranteed hysterical night of karaoke, alcohol and dinosaurs in space. Or whatever other birthday theme you'd like to apply.

One of the photos here shows a tempura battered jalapeno half filled with all sorts of goodness. All I have to say is: put-it-in-my-mouth. Last night's dinner at Yen was re-frickin-diculous. Dottsy suggested going balls to the wall with the Chef's Choice and she was not wrong. We started off with miso soup, then a small pickled cucumber salad. Then the sashimi plate arrived. As much as I wanted to scream "MINE!" and fight off my friends' advancing chopsticks, I held back. Salmon, tuna, albacore, yellowtail and octopus graced this huge display and each one was really mouth-watering. the octopus in particular was delicate and not at all rubbery. The tuna melted on my chopsticks before dissolving completely on my tongue.   After we raided the sashimi plate we were delivered some baked roll that was inhaled before the server even left the table. I have to admit that after that roll we waited a good 20 minutes for another one to arrive, or even more. That was a bummer, but fortunately we had excellent company with whom to pass the time. In total we had the sashimi plate plus 5 rolls, which was a gut-busting affair. We completemented our meals with big ole sapporos and a few people had sake(bombs).   All in all the measure of a sushi place is how fresh their cuts of fish are and Yen is tied for first on my list of best sushi places. The $60 per person price tag was a little scary but I do feel like the quality warranted the price tag, if not the quantity of rolls. And even though this is a hike, I will be back because of the spectacular work they did with their fish.

My very last supper in Phoenix was at Yen Sushi & Sake, omakase all the way. The experience at Yen is top-notch and the staff is on point. Typically if everyone is doing chef's choice, you share all the plates, but in an inspired twist, Chef presented us with individual plates of sashimi. Filled.to.the.brim. Holy cow, this could have been a meal in and of itself, loaded down with octopus, ahi tuna, albacore, salmon so fresh and fatty it melted like butter in my mouth, and two other cuts I can't remember. SO MUCH SASHIMI! Then our table was hit with five more plates of rolls, one right after the other, including the cucumber lollipops, the heart attack, a little tempura, etc. We chowed on all of it, audibly moaning and pointing at things while trying to wrap our mouths around gigantic roll slices.  Best sushi in the Valley, what more could I possibly say?

i have two words for you: herb baguette. I'm not a bread lover but this baguette doesn't need anything to taste good. Forget butter and don't bother dipping in olive oil. How is it possible that bread be so moist, dense, airy and flavorful all at the same time? I have no freakin' idea and that's why I have to buy from Gluten Free Creations, because there's no way I could replicate that.   Okay okay I have no qualms with gluten. I don't really care what it is because it doesn't seem to affect me negatively, but why should only the celiac kids get the good stuff? And yes, I have tried to find this place twice before and failed (are gluten eaters stupid-er? possibly) but third times a charm when I stopped in this week. I'll admit it, I was looking for a cupcake. I think we all know about my cupcake addiction. GFC sells cupcakes in a 4-pack, which I can't support because that means I have to eat 4 cupcakes and I'm already killing myself at the gym for my one-at-a-time habit. But seriously, they had gluten free banana cupcakes! I was so sad they didn't have a spare to sell me...so sad I bought the mini herb baguettes and a brownie.   The brownie was a two-person affair, a big frozen delight filled with thick chunks of chocolate. I couldn't tell the difference between it and a gluten-full brownie and that made me very happy. I think it may be time to start the "what makes a good brownie" debate; I feel like it will be a volatile one. I like them chewy with chunky bits. But the fluffy ones are nice too.    Truly though, the hero of the day was the herb baguette, which is a little smaller than a 6-inch sub, takes a long time to toast, but is worth the wait. I topped one of mine with farmer's cheese, roasted garlic and roasted red peppers. And I sat at the table crying because I knew each bite I took meant there was one less to take in the future.   I love you Gluten Free Creations. I'm feeling smarter already.

What incredibly friendly people work at Sweet Republic! I went in and waded through a sea of small children (ugh) to get to the counter, where my curiosity and indecision was completely approved of. I got to try chocolate rosemary, mint chip and honey yogurt, all of which I liked very much. I went ahead and got a double cup of the latter two and sat down in their patio seating area to enjoy the afternoon and my two scoops.   I love that SR is an independent ice cream-otier in a society full of baskin robbins and stone cold creamery. plus you don't feel like you have to run a marathon to work off their treats, especially since the sorbets and yogurts are fat free and everything is made onsite with natural products.

I finally made my way to the market and Al-Hana yesterday for a lunchtime feast. I ordered WAY too much for myself and 2 co-workers but everything was just as I remember from my childhood (of eating things most other kids wouldn't). I thought the dolmas in particular had a great consistency, density and flavor. my boss loved the meat and cheese pies, the hummus was nice, not too thick like pre-made hummus, and the babaghannouj was blended to perfection. I spent $27 on what turned out to be 5+ meals.   YUM! Al-Hana I adore you!

I picked up a copy of a natural remedies book a few months ago but was dissuaded from trying any of the more complex recipes for facial cleansers, moisturizers, and home care because I had to order herbs online and I really like being able to see what I'm purchasing. Now that I live in Phoenix I am blessed to have found Chakra 4 Herb which holds a cornucopia of herbal concoctions. I went in with a list of herbs that frankly I've never heard of and they had all of them and dozens more.   The store is tucked on the interior path of the Town & Country strip mall and even though it's small it is well organized and spacious and they have even opened up their business with a cafe! The menu seems limited but delicious, I didn't stop to eat as I was on a shopping spree through the area but I will definitely be back for a meal and an infusion!   You can buy herbs by the ounce and they are somewhat expensive...yet less so than having to buy in bulk online and pay for shipping. I would say the range was about $2 - $4 for each ounce of herby things I got yesterday. Really friendly staff too, I am so excited to try out making my own natural beauty products!

I should probably give in and up this review to 5 stars but I want to go back and right an update where I use LOADS of exclamation points, so I'll stick with 4 stars for today.   That said: !!!!!!!!! and to follow up: yummmm.   I stopped by for lunch and sat on the front patio which was perfect since the the sun was diffused, there was a breeze and I could eyeball other people's meals while I waited. My server was Sam who is probably the most gregarious server I've had in a long time. That was great because I was dining alone and he made me feel like I was not a loser. I ordered the Corn Gorditas ($9) and the Taro Fries ($7) and was pleased with both. My only regret was using the fries' two dipping sauces because it numbed my pallate a little in terms of appreciating the nuances of the gorditas, which were a little small for a $9 appetizer but all the same, very complete in their blend of flavors and textures.   Then I took my meal to the next level by ordering dessert. I'm not sure "orgasm in my mouth" is a family-friendly term but nonetheless it applies to the pumpkin bread pudding ($6) I ordered. As if pumpkin needed any help, The Mission soaks it in a caramel sauce and sprinkles it with pepitas and pomegranate seeds after adding a heaping scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. orgasm.in.my.mouth. I only wished there were a few more pomegranate seeds tossed on there because their tart juice really contrasted beautifully. I tried not to moan out loud as I ate it.   So the Mission isn't cheap, not by a long stretch, but what is created in that kitchen is culinary artwork, and combined with their very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere, I think the Mission is doing everything right.

I met Kelly Garcia Sunday at the Craftsman Court farmer's market in Old Town - She is my cupcake hero. I figured I would wait for some sort of occasion to get myself to another bakery for cupcake testing but Sunday morning the cupcake came to me! I used to make fun of Argentinean hotels that offered breakfast cupcakes and then here I was at 10AM buying a chocolate cupcake with vanilla buttercream frosting and tiny lavendar sugar pearls.   The cupcake: You can tell immediately when someone loves their work, and while I didn't speak to Kelly for any length of time she told me everything I needed to know as soon as I bit into the cupcake. This woman knows cupcakes. My cupcake was light as air - it was that magic blend of moist cake fluffed with air, not to sweet but distinctly chocolate-y, oh it was soooo good. Even the buttercream was light, it was silky too, like maybe it had been made with confectioners sugar because it was so smooth. The frosting was on the high end of the sweet spectrum for me, but the textures mixing around in that cupcake made it spectacular.   A single cupcake ran me $3 and I didn't ask about pricing on dozens but she did tell me that she offers free delivery in Scottsdale. I just now went to her website where she says she will make you any and every kind of cupcake you could want.  Vanilla cupcake with lemon curd filling and lemon buttercream? yes please. Chocolate with peppermint buttercream? oh mama. I also noticed a sign on her stand that said she could make gluten-free and I bet she could keep me in vegan cupcakes too. oh lord this is very very bad...

This farmers market is really accessible...though i'm not convinced there were any farmers there. McClendon's Market was the only green grocer in attendance and frankly their prices (even for organic) were ridiculous. $2 for 1 pound of apples. You know how many apples that is? 2. They aren't filled with diamonds people.   But everything else at this market is really great and all the vendors are SUPER friendly! I had wine (at 10AM, now that's living!), agave nectar, coffee, tamale samples and a free 15 minute chair massage.   I also really like that it is in the parking corral on 2nd and there are plenty of spots for all the shoppers. This is the third week the market has been open and it will run through April. I think if you are seriously dedicated to organic produce and other edible items you will be VERY happy with this market.

I've been to sidebar twice now, for two different and equally fun birthday outings. Getting the obvious things out of the way: The bar staff is always very friendly and don't leave you stranded for hours. Parking is plentiful. There is only one bathroom for each gender, which could lead to long waits, but I've never had to, so that's rad. And as both a pro and a con, it is a small space upstairs of a Pei Wei or something and is very intimate and speakeasy-esque.   What I find unique about SideBar are the people who fill the space. The first time I was there there was a large group of hispanic ska-punks and a grotesque couple doing inappropriate things on a couch in front of everyone. The second time it was more of a post-grad crew. Both times everyone mixed well and had a great night. I like that all sorts of people hang out here, even if you are a regular you're likely to meet new, entertaining people.

Wow, after taking a look at the parks website i feel like my review will be incomplete. Well I'll couch it.   This morning I was looking for somewhere to walk around and the receptionist at my hotel said there was a park just a half mile down on McKellips. I drove by it first, then on the return found it opposite of 1733 McKellips Road. I got out and set off on the wide, well-maintained sidewalk. It wasn't that early, but the park looked abandoned except for a park working spraying something with a hose and assorted homeless people. I jogged around the lake once and went on my way, it was too manufactured I guess, and creepy that it was so abandoned.   Now I see that it is only 1 of 3 huge tracks that I was running on, and that actually the park extends from McKellips up to MacDowell. I will go back to check out the whole span of the park, see if i can find any people.  All in all, I've experienced better.

Cheryl is a smart lady, hooking you on her talented handiwork by offering free 15 minute chair massages at the Scottsdale Farmer's Market. I stopped by and she had a waiting list, but I signed up, shopped around and came back for my turn.   Right on with pressure, and she had some moves no one else has every done on me. She has an office as well as offering to come out to your home ($85 plus trip fee)  and here is the list of services she offers:  Myofacial Release Lymphatic Drainage Cellulite Reduction Pregnancy Massage East Indian Head Massage Traditional Thai Massage Rain Drop Therapy Swedish Massage  Her rates are 30 mins for $35; 1 hour for $65; 1.5 hours $90 as well as discounted packages and a Referral discount (hehemmm, refer to me!)  She also does take credit cards so that is helpful. I am heading over to her for a follow up visit on Dec 6 and will update again!

I hit up the Tamale Stores table at the Old Town Scottsdale Farmer's Market on Saturday, where the two brother owners were giving away free samples of their warm corn treats. They have standard beef, pork and chicken tamales as well as a number of sweet ones including blueberry and pumpkin.   I bought a packet of two cheese and mushroom tamales that i had today for lunch. all i have to say is mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. gooey cheesy goodness! I haven't been to the store...yet. But it seems inevitable that i'll get myself some hot, sweet pumpkiny tamales for thanksgiving.

Disclaimer: I am not a resident at Paragon. I went in looking for a 1-bedroom apartment.   I am on the hunt for an apartment and I took myself through north scottsdale today, stopping in at paragon on my tour. I would say that just about every apartment sales office that opens on sundays (some don't, granted) opens at 12PM and stays open to 4 or 5PM. I arrived at 12:45 to find out that Paragon doesn't open until 1PM. lame. I toyed with leaving and not seeing the property, but didn't listen to my instincts (mistake #1). I waited it out and came back at about 1:05.   I walk inside and there is no one at reception, well fine, i'll just wait. Someone yells from the back "Morning!!" I don't know if they are talking to me so I say nothing. "MORNING!!!" again. "oh hi there" I reply. "You are just going to have to wait, I'm setting up still!" Huh? Who says that? I wasn't complaining about waiting, and besides that, you don't talk to clients or prospective clients that way.   Iris walks out and offers me a cookie as she walks by saying "you know we don't open until 1PM" me: "It is one, isn't it?" her: "barely." UGH! Why didn't I leave?! Then we are talking and she's getting my info and she asks my price range and then tells me "oh well you won't find that here." and yet I didn't leave (mistake #56 at this point). So for the first half of the tour and explanation she is a big puffed up elitist telling me how exclusive this is or how fancy and amazing that is.  Amazingly by the second half of the tour she was telling me she could get the price down to my price range (through flagrantly faulty math) and saying she could really picture me here. Yikes, no thanks lady!  A 1-bedroom here runs $990 a month with no utilities included. The apartment and the complex are nice, but I have seen apartments that are equally as nice with the exact same amenities for $250 less per month. And with the offensive attitude of the sales person, I simply cannot imagine what kind of elitist douche-bags actually live here. if you are a normal person living at paragon, god bless you i don't know how you do it.

Marshalls is my go-to for dresses and shoes, and this location does not disappoint. I strolled through last night and was impressed with the shoe department. Usually you'll see the tall shoe racks with random pairs of shoes arranged in order of sizing, but this location has a Shoe Mega Store, which apparently means the shoes are set up DSW style and come in boxes. Shocking!   Now I don't have the patience to scour rack after rack for jeans or tops, but it is really easy to go dress and suit shopping here because there are many fewer racks and its pretty easy to see what's what without even touching the hangers. The dress selection here was slim, I will admit, but I found a calvin klein skirt suit that is ADORABLE and happens to look fantastic on me. Can anyone say clearance rack $49? Needless to say I walked out of Marshall's $50 lighter, but also much more stylish.   PS: their home goods and lamps are really well priced too, and they have loads of cute pillows. oh Marshall's, I love you.

What a nice experience for my first time up in North Phoenix. Janelle H pointed out that City North may be negatively impacted by the depressed economy in searching for leasees for this new shopping center, but I have to say that the concept is charming and makes me want to stroll up and down High Street, possibly with a parasol.   Uh anyway, PCFW is also a charming little coffee shop that utilizes its space well and feels at once airy and cozy. The huge table at the back seems tailor-made for Yelp gatherings and I got to meet some great yelpers, sip coffee, eat a cupcake and get a super secret ceviche tip that I will cherish forever. I ordered a regular old coffee, because anyone can fancy up coffee drinks with syrups, foams and loads of milk, but the test of a coffee shop should be its pure unadulterated drip/press. I went for a half-decaf and thought the taste was still rich and not at all bitter (which happens when the machines aren't cleaned, yuck!). I also didn't vibrate home so it wasn't overly steeped and I very much appreciated that.   PCFW had a tasty-looking menu, namely the red pepper and smoked gouda soup and in the bakery case, a slice of chocolate cake that looked like pure fudge. I would go back for both items...but I didn't order either because Sarah G bewitched me with carrot cake cupcakes.   The outdoor seating is made that much more pleasant because of the corner unit location as you don't have to wave away exhaust fumes whilst enjoying friends and a good coffee.

I just started up with NGD and I am thrilled! The site is easy to navigate, the deadlines are clear and you can make exchanges on your box order if you don't like one thing and want more of another. Plus the staff is very communicative and friendly and I feel so good supporting local and organic farming. So far I have set myself up for every other week deliveries of the small box...which they say is for 2 people, or just 1 Erin. I'm trying to ration my produce but I am a vegetable fiend.   I think the small box price $35 is really reasonable because you get loads of great basics like yams, onions, lettuce, apples, etc. This week the bananas and the avocados were a bit rock like, and before I even got my box I had an email apologizing and saying they will work on getting better produce for everyone next time. Unripened fruit isn't that distressing to me, it just means I'll have something left to eat in a few days.   Meat eaters can also find organic beef and...whatever you all eat on there too...I really didn't look as I was enthralled by a photo of lettuce. Doesn't take much people, but NGD really did deliver.

I can't believe I never reviewed Avalon! I'm very glad it's my 500th review though, so let's begin:  I happened upon Avalon during CRAVE Arizona's week of festivities October 21 - 24. My shop was the retail partner for the wine events and I was required to attend one of the luncheons on Friday, Oct 23. What a tough life I lead. Avalon is kind of in the middle of nowhere, but they excel at what they are doing so it's a destination worth finding.   My lunch was exquisitely paired with two WA wineries, Milbrant and Gordon Brothers. It's actually pretty hard to make a perfect pairing with very specific wines so kudos to Executive Chef Travis Watson for his masterful menu. I'm going to ruin your whole day right now and tell you what I ate:  First Course  Smoked mussel soup with crispy leeks and crusty garlic bread  - I love mussels but the idea of mussels out of the shell kind of creeps me out. This soup was so smoky and spicy everyone at our luncheon asked for more. It was served in a demitasse which was tragic, but a great way to start an amazing meal.  Second Course  Organic petite green salad with Granny Smith apples and walnut streusel - Chef Travis came out to talk to us about how his goal with Avalon is to source local, biodynamic and organic produce and meats across the board. This salad was fresh with just that hint of sweetness from the streusel. It wasn't overwhelming at all and I thought the Riesling we had with it was an inspired match.  Third Course  Grilled rib eye steak with black truffle risotto, foie butter and baby heirloom beets - I'm not a vegetarian anymore. I'm not even going to pretend. I chowed on this steak and it was delightful, very pink in the middle and deliciously moist. The risotto was a little dry and not very hot; my only critique of the day. The heirloom beets were orange and tiny and I actually ate them (not a beet fan).   Fourth Course  Milk chocolate and salted caramel torte with espresso essence and tangerine pearls - aaaaaa! This was ridiculously good, and waaaay too big after all we'd eaten. I'm a dark chocolate fan myself, but this worked in every way imaginable. The milk chocolate and the salty caramel? puhleese it was amazing.   I saw three of my clients heading out after their own lunch in another half of the restaurant and they told me this is their go to place for high quality eats. They sang me the praises of the lobster bisque, though they told me the wine selection was seriously lacking. Aww they are so loyal! I met two couples at the lunch who were also voracious fans of Avalon and hysterically shouted across the table that we all need to support this place and tell our friends.   I'm with them; do yourself a favor and dine at Avalon.

I'm not a crazed tree hugger but I try to be eco-friendly in the small ways that I can be. Buying non VOC paints free from toxic preservatives and coloring agents may not save the planet but it makes me feel good. I was excited to find Eco-Clean was so close too, don't have to waste precious fuel getting there and that's 100% wallet-friendly.   So the store is small. and jumbly. You can buy paint, flooring, afghani salt rock lights, organic beauty products, air filters, pet care, mattresses, bedding, carpets, baby products and cleaning supplies, to  name a few things...really, check out the website for the fully myriad of environmentally aware products they sell.   The paint selection is absolutely the same selection you can find at home depot next door. I simply would not believe that a person couldn't find the exact shade they were looking for because the sample wall is huge. I brought in some items I wanted to match (pillow and print) and found just the right wall color.  The atmosphere was laidback and I felt no pressure to  hurry up and choose or buy extra things. The gallon prices are more expensive than home depot, yes even home depot's 'fresh aire' line (but fresh aire has a poor color selection anyway) at about $15 for a quart and $43 for a gallon.   I painted my bedroom and living room yesterday and found the paint to be really quick drying, definitely needing a second coat to even out the color, so an all around normal painting experience. There is a smell, a strange smell and though the paint had dried I could smell it for a few hours afterwards, but whatever, it's paint, it smells.   I thought it was curious that they sold beauty products here as really it seems like a home supply store but I bought a hemp oil lip balm i like and saw a little organic beauty kit that looks like a good option for traveling! I wish I had known about them when I was looking for a mattress!

Tonight I went to my first class at Metta Community Yoga. First off, it's so close I can walk and that is beautiful, man. Secondly, MCY offers new students a 15 day trial run for $30, and considering the drop in rate is $14, you will have gotten your moneys worth in just 3 classes. They also offer a 25% if you buy a package (there are many, see website) within that 14 day period. rad!  I took the 530PM Yin class which is very mellow and emphasizes deep stretching for ultimate tension release by holding certain poses for about 5 minutes each. The instructor Regina really enhanced the atmosphere with her calming words of support and inspiration and i really appreciated that she came around to help people move deeper into poses or help them modify their moves. It seemed like there were a few other Metta teachers in tonights class which says to me that 'community' isn't just a marketing ploy.  I am so excited to practice at MCY - the ideal spot to really focus on learning about and improving your body, not to mention your spirit.

Not a fan. A group of us swung by during June's First Friday around 830PM. We were seated relatively fast and our orders were taken in short order, but after that service came to a grinding halt. The menu is limited in general but the sandwiches looked great, of course that was not what I ordered. I went for the $5 gypsy stew which was really tasty, but I was served a portion that should have cost $1.25. I mean seriously, soup is the classic poor people food, this had like 16 garbanzos, a few random veggies floating around in it and a little bit of potato. For $5 I could have made at least a gallon of soup. Please at least serve a portion that isn't blatant about ripping me off. Thank you. Because I'd gone light on dinner I ordered the olive oil cake thing I'd seen at the register with a tag on it that said $2.50 a slice. The cake came out with a side of 4 cantaloupe cubes and 1 strawberry in some glaze. The cake was nice, pretty much the consistency of corn bread and no heavy olive flavor. I'd never had it before so weee, new things in my mouth.  When it came time to pay my $2.50 slice of cake morphed into a $5.50 dessert. Say what?   I am infinitely annoyed by price gouging and none of this food is spectacularly intricate or worth the wait. When I tell you that we waited 30 minutes for 4 sandwiches and 1 cup of soup I am not speaking in hyperbole. We didn't leave sapna until 10PM because the server forgot to serve me the cake slice i'd ordered at the same time as the soup.    Yeah I guess I'm a little bitter about it.

Last night Arcadia Fine Wine (where I work) held an event at the Sub-Zero Wolf Showroom in Scottsdale and it went spectacularly. I'm a renter, and I'm poor, so I'd never been into the SZW showroom. The event was for about 40 people and the team at SZW was really helpful, setting up the tables, adding flowers and other decorations around the showroom, and even baking cranberry-oatmeal cookies and chocolate mini-cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for our guests. The demo kitchen is the sexiest kitchen I've ever seen - rich woods, caramel colored granite, gorgeous wolf equipment of course, and the world's biggest island is on a raised platform with 3 cameras over each of the three stovetops that broadcast onto 3 huge plasma tvs above the set. All of the showroom's kitchens are functional, which was great for the competitors to be able to a little prep before taking the stage.   I don't know if SZW rents this space out but it seems like a fantastic party spot. I want to do Iron Chef competitions every month just so I can hang out there. And of course if you need kitchen appliances you can't beat this spot and their warm and helpful staff.

I used to love gyms. I loved nothing more than getting up at 5AM every day and spending 2 hours at the gym and then heading to work.  When I moved to Phoenix I quickly found out that there are only two options here: a ridiculously priced country club or a soulless workout studio.   Look, I don't need a luxury gym experience, my last gym was a Washington Sports Club which is spare on design and crammed with loads of equipment. I decided on LA Fitness because it was close to my home and cheap. It looked nice enough.   It wasn't nice enough. There isn't anything wrong with LAF but there isn't anything right about it either. The classes are timed poorly, there aren't very many of them, and the instructors they had when I was there weren't great. The yoga teacher, for instance, was probably really a kickboxing teacher and the class was just awful - the complete opposite of zen. There is plenty of equipment but it doesn't flow well. There are a grand total of 4 exercise balls, and the hand weight tower in the 'floor exercise' area has been looted. There is precious little space for any floor exercising anyway, and the stretching equipment is bizarre and very little used.   I am astonished and disgusted that LAF and most gyms here don't offer towels or cleaning spray and found myself constantly running for the paper towel dispensers and hand sanitzer. I also found the sales and personal training staff obnoxious. At my 'free one hour PT session' I was sat in front of a desk for 40 minutes listening to the history of PT and how it could help me, and even when I stopped Zack or whoever he was to tell him that I was well acquainted with personal training and could we skip to the actual personal training, he continued on with food pyramids and the concept of multiple reps. And after a whopping 15 minutes of him showing me how to do squats we returned to the desk where he tried to sell me PT packages. I repeatedly said 'no' and he pulled the old car salesman trick of going to talk to his manager and then coming back with a better deal! Finally I just walked out.  Besides all of that, LA Fitness doesn't have a good vibe. Like I said, it's not about decoration or saunas and pools for me, it's about making working out enjoyable. I never enjoyed LA Fitness, so I've quit after 7 months (which means they robbed me of 9 months per their cancellation requirements).   They can keep my 75 bucks, it's worth every penny to never go back there.

For me, eating is all about texture and flavors and frozen yogurt is one of my favorite summertime treats for its cool creaminess. mmmm. I stopped in to Yogurtland two weeks ago and at 3 in the afternoon it was packed with children (yuck, minus 1 for you yogurtland). I persevered, making my way to the awkwardly arranged yogurt dispensers. Why are there glass columns in the middle of the shop? It makes getting in and out unnecessarily difficult.   Anyway, I sampled a few besides deciding on Taro frozen yogurt. Taro?! YUMMY! Pistachio, coconut and even the "tart" lemon lime one were very good. I'm also a big vanilla fan but I didn't get to try that as 2 idiot children were running around eating their body weight in free samples of chocolate and vanilla, and the machine ran out and for about 15 minutes the employees didn't know what to do about it.   So the point is, thank god kids are back in school, you can probably go to Yogurtland with much less to-do AND the yogurt is delicious, has the perfect consistency, creative flavors and lots of toppings for the toppings-inclined. There are no 'small' cups as the payment is by weight but they can't pressure me into overloading my cup, haha! The world's cheapest girl got away from Yogurtland having spent only 2.12 on two orders!

Love it. Petite Maison rocks, the end. The design is cozy and refined and sexy, the staff are friendly and attentive, the service is super fast even when they are packed and the food is delicious. I've only been there late at night and hear great things about the brunch, but let me tell you, the escargot is fabulous, the salade maison is the perfect size and refreshing, and I tried a port-poached pear and creme fraiche dessert the last time I was there that was incredibly lively and light.   The parking is kind of tough because of competition from nearby bars and clubs, but there's always valet if you're impatient.

Well, today's the day I dump on SNMC unfortunately. As an east-coast transplant I knew nothing about naturopathy, but it has a good reputation out here and I thought since I'm paying for my own health bills I would try it out and see if a Naturopath could help me with a few minor issues.   The first time I went in I found out that my few minor issues were really deeply rooted systemic problems and immediately I was strong-armed into taking a $200 blood test to determine what food products I was allergic to. This is, of course, above and beyond the visit fees, which were not cheap either. Well, what do I know, I didn't realize everything revolved around my intestines so okay let's do this test and figure it out. Apparently I'm allergic to 13 different things, a 'fact' I seriously doubt.  I'm not going to go into everything that took place with Dr. Crinnian and his residents, but suffice it to say I spent more than $600 with these people and neither of my two issues have been resolved. In addition to that I developed a rash and Crinnian wasn't available the day I called in so I made the first appointment I could get with Dr. Marchese. She had a better bedside manner than Crinnian BY FAR but prescribed me with something that made the rash worse. Super! The next time I saw Crinnian I told him the rash wasn't getting better and I guess he was pissed that I hadn't come in to fit his schedule because it was relayed to me through one of his residents that it wasn't his problem because he didn't diagnose me.   Well, no one at the medical center ever diagnosed me, ever. I was basically asked to diagnose myself with hours of repeated questioning of my symptoms. Even when I figured out what this new problem was, and told Dr. Marchese (I dumped Crinnian in a heartbeat and went back to her) that the only thing that has gotten rid of it before was antibiotics, I kid you not, she prescribed me a homeopathic remedy for COLDS WITH RUNNY NOSES. needless to say, that didn't work.   Taking into account all the supplements they insisted I needed to survive I'm sure I probably spent well more than that $600 in the five months I went there.    All Scottsdale Naturopathic Medical Center wants from you is money, endless streams of money and their doctors don't seem to actually care if they are helping you.

Last night I was lucky enough to try out Crudo for the first time. The crew was soft-launching their dinner menu and offered a VERY special $15 price for a 3-course meal. Chrissy and Dottsy joined me for the 6PM reservation, so the evening was off to a great start. We were seated outside which was still a little chilly, but a small heat lamp was brought out and arranged by our table without our requesting it.   Their standard menu will offer 3, 4, and 5 course options, at $30, $40 and $50 or you can offer off the menu. Keep in mind that our dinner was a preview, and the menu is not finalized yet. As of now the menu is divided into Freddo and Caldo options and I made my meal of the Butterfish with a citrus glaze, the Hamachi with black garlic and truffle oil, and the Risotto, which had a massive mushroom seared on top and (kind of gross to think about but tasty nonetheless) cock's comb. Yes, the red dangly bits of a chicken. blerg. The risotto was great though, if you didn't know about the cock's comb you would have though it was sauteed mushroom, so that's what I pretended. The Butterfish was great, super buttery and the citrus sauce was just the right note to set it off. Hands down my favorite plate was the Hamachi though, the texture and density of the yellowtail was perfect and the apples, truffle oil and black garlic on it were to die for.   The wine list we were presented with numbered 5 wines with no prices, and while I'm a Bisol Jeio Prosecco fan I wasn't crazy about the red and white options, but I'm sure they are working on that. Our server was Lisa G, and her presence instigated an odd sort of tourettes in both Dottsy and Chrissy: "balls! balls! we love your balls! put your balls on the menu!"  The service, by Lisa and the rest of the Crudo staff and chefs was perfect, perfectly timed, very welcoming, open to questions. I would gladly spend another couple of hours at Crudo enjoying their menu, it was really inspired.

When I first moved here, I received a coupon in the mail for a free oil change (that turned out to cost $6, whatever.). I love free things, so I headed straight for NAPA to cash in on that bad boy. Service was fairly quick and I was pleased with their service. The showroom smelled terrible though, that awful brand new tire smell that was overwhelming. So there's my only criticism.   Well last weekend, my car got angry when it heard I planned on taking it to Flagstaff in the snow and started flashing a 'Maintenance Required' light at me. Brat. I hightailed it back to Heck/NAPA because I felt good about their pricing, and I had a good vibe about them. It was close to close (4PM) but the customer service rep was able to take my Honda in immediately for a check up. While we waited, he entertained my 16 year old companion with his iTunes selections and heckled me about being old. He was amusing. The smell I'd experienced the first time was no where to be found, for which I was profoundly grateful.   The mechanics went through every bit of my car and it turned out I just needed another oil change and a new air filter. Thankfully I got out of there under $40 and was able to take my 16 year old and my car into a snowy nightmare that was Flagstaff. But that's another story.   I'm glad to have found a place I trust to work on my car and I will undoubtedly be back.

I attended my first Robert Black fashion show a number of months ago and since then I've been meaning to get in to his shop on 1st Ave. It never worked out because my working hours were exactly the same as his typical hours, Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 6pm. Fortunately, unemployment opens up ones day rather dramatically, so I finally got in to his shop about 3 weeks ago!   I would wear dresses exclusively, weather permitting, and this is a wonderland for my addiction. Robert let me meander around and offered any help as I needed it. I tried really hard to stay away from the fabulous gowns at the back, though my arms reached for some delightful vintage floor length dresses that would have set me back $800 a piece.   I ended up with what I call a 'Sound of Music' dress, a tea-length halter dress with a full skirt that is perfect for a wedding in a national park that I'm attending later this summer. Or you know, fleeing to the Alps.   Dresses are completely reasonably priced (mine was $85) and there are funky vintage costume jewelry pieces, lovely hats and vintage shoes in great condition. Get yourself in there!
