Worst car wash ever! I took my car in today because my chocolate protein shake exploded all over the front seat. My dogs also left two very distinct mud marks on the back seat. I left my car there for a few hours and expected it to look at least semi decent when I picked it up. Boy was I wrong. As I was driving home I noticed that they didn't do anything! I bought the package that included shampooing the seats and there is no way that was done. There were chocolate spots all over my door, steering wheel and all over the seat. The mud marks in back haven't even been touched.  I included pictures to show what a bad job they did. This is not the first time they have done a bad job on my car but this will be the last time I take my car in! I'm mad I even tipped them!

My husband and I came in today for lunch. We got amazing service from a bartender named Katie (I believe). She was very attentive and she knew the beer and menu items to the full extent. The food is amazing too. Ask about their weekly special burger. We will be coming back!

I have been to this bar before and it has always been ok. Tonight was awful! I met up with some friends who were already there playing Bingo. I waited almost 15 minuets before I got frustrated and went to the bar to get a drink. The bartender was friendly and my drink and my food came out fast. This is the only reason  why they are getting any stars. I went back to the table and another 20 min went by. Our server, Amanda, finally showed up to see if my friends wanted another round. Their drinks had been empty for almost half an hour! We placed our order and finally got the drinks ten min later. We sat there for the rest of the night watching her at the other side of the bar talking with the other servers and not taking care of any of her tables. We had to stop a different server to get our check. If it wasn't for the bartender I would have given it 1 star.

I have been going to Cassie for almost two years now and every time I go in she out does herself. The color is always perfect! She always knows exactly what I want. As long as I'm in Arizona I will always go to Cassie.

I am officially addicted to this place! I normally don't like kale but the popeye acai smoothie is amazing. It's delicious and it fills me up. The people who work here are really nice and the drinks come out pretty fast.
