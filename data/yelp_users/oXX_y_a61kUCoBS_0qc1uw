These guys are awesome. From the front desk to the mechanic you're assigned (and who will work on your car each time you visit) it was one of the most pleasant experiences I've ever had at a auto shop. I decided to sit down and just wait for my routine engine oil filter change and at one point got a bit thirsty, I asked and Patrick, behind the desk ran and got me a water bottle! Likewise when it was all done I met Terrance, the mechanic assigned to my car and he told me everything he went over and helped me find a place to fix my alignment and balance my tires. I will be a customer here until I move!

I can now say I've waited 25 minutes in a drive thru line... The food was decent, definitely made fresh as it was hot when I got it... but the fact that there was a small child running around the kitchen was a bit unnerving. Overall not worth the wait...

I frequent this place more often than I care to admit but with free samples and a great variety of different gelato flavors how could I not? Some common reasons why you might find me in Gelato Spot:  - Holiday - Bad Day - Good Day - Normal Day - Sunday... or Monday... or Tuesday-Saturday - I'm sad - I'm happy - It's been several days since my last visit - It's been several hours since my last visit - Friends are in town - I wish my friends were in town  ... well you get the picture... one of these days I'll try the pizza place as well and I'm sure it won't disappoint

Great happy hour deals, great margaritas, great service. Definitely could become my favorite.

Cheap happy hour wine, delicious bruschetta, and comfy chairs. Only thing that would make this place better would be grapes fed to me from the vine... a girl can dream I suppose.  Oh one bad thing, the wings are subpar but it's a wine place, who the hell gets the wings?

Always a great happy hour. A little older crowd but incredible food and cocktails. Their awesome old fashioned combined with their great taste in music always creates an atmosphere worth coming back to. I've yet to see the room behind the bookcase but I'm sure I will eventually.

Let me paint you a picture. It's getting kind of late. You have a choice, you could go to the gym, make a healthy meal, shower, and feel pretty good about yourself... or you could throw on some baggy clothes, boot up netflix, and order Yummy Yummy. I chose the latter. I choose the latter quite a bit. I am simultaneously amazed at the combination of both the ever so slightly better than mediocre chinese that I am given and the superhuman-like ability of the delivery man to macgyver his way into whatever passcode protected apartment complex I choose to have him deliver to. Likewise I am grateful for his speedy judgement-free exit once the necessary I take food, you take money exchange is complete... Though they always give me silverware for two...   Overall I find each Yummy Yummy experience one that satisfies my needs for fast, unhealthy american-style chinese that is brought to me no matter the obstacle.

I've been going here for about 2 months now and I can't complain. I'd feel weird giving a gym 5 stars unless they offered something ridiculous like free massages, personal training, and fat shaming... well maybe not the last one. But Independence Gym is still a great gym. Loads of people that are serious about their health, plenty of room and equipment and friendly staff. Likewise after having eavesdropped on a few of their personal training sessions I can conclude that these guys really know their stuff. I don't see anybody doing silly exercises that look like some exotic bird's mating ritual, it's all useful and effective exercises with great coaching.  All in all a great place.
