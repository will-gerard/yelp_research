This chain has definitely assisted with my ever-growing addiction to crazy bread. Sometimes they can be extremely busy and they seem to pump out the orders with these and are always extremely friendly. Just got two orders of crazy bread tonight and it's freaking delicious.

I don't think I've ever had a decent experience at this location. The employees are so so bad. Borderline comical. I recommend going just for the experience.

Very fair priced , very clean, and I really like the area. Staff has always been very helpful, I'm not sure if they have a free breakfast or not but as far as I know they do not. Also a pet friendly hotel if that is a concern of yours.

I would literally go to this place everyday if I could or remembered to. For some reason it has a very similar to that of a Ross retail store. Very clean and very well kept, very friendly employees, and they get a lot of really really cool stuff. Definitely favorite thrift store overall.

Bottom line, jack in the box pretty much sucks at any location. Although the mini churros.. Omg

I could eat the Carne asada for the rest of my life. Say that the prices are fair for the most part but can get pricy if you have a large family when I have seen similar places it's a lot more competitive pricing. Very good food overall for any meal breakfast lunch or dinner

Just leaving the Circle K right now from where I purchased a soft drink and a couple packs of cigarettes. I know this is a little bit too much information, but it's necessary. My stomach has been on the fritz today from something I ate and I was really not feeling good and had to make a pit stop for this reason along with my purchases. I had the cashier walk into the bathroom in the loudly state that I have been in there 410 minutes and I had three more otherwise I was going to call the police. I responded by saying are you kidding me? When he goes no because it's night time. What the f*** is that not only was that an awkward exit from the bathroom, but completely uncalled for. I asked him as I was buying my items if 13 minutes was the allotted time for one to take a s***. He responded by saying oh no its night time and we try to keep our bathrooms clean because we found needles in there. The bathroom look like s*** I don't know what the hell he was talking about.

Giving the place a couple stars because it was semi-quiet and peaceful. The guy at the front desk was immediately rude and difficult. I given a room facing inside (see lovely pool), so I asked to be switched to the outside. On a Wednesday night, trust me, there was vacancies. He disagreed and said they were all full, refusing to switch me even though we hadn't dropped one bag of luggage on even the floor of the lobby. I may be incorrect, and I'm very easy going, but the last I checked I was the one who was spending the hundreds of dollars and I think that should at the very least warrant a decent room. What really made me mad was that anytime I even tried to ask a question such as 'so you're telling me that all of these are full?' The front desk guy would not even acknowledge me and just kept doing whatever on his computer . It was pretty offensive to be treated as if I was talking to the wall. Extremely rude. Started the whole experience on a sour note. Oh and the breakfast sucks.

The rooms are decent sized, and the view is awesome. Employees for the most part after nice although the metrosexual men at the front desk are a bit snooty. This isn't the Phoenician brotha, this used to be an IHOP come on now.. The 'theme' of the hotel I found to be kind of cheesy but who cares? Oh and hallway carpet is terrible.  Overall very pleasant stay and would like to return.

Water heater wouldn't stay lit on a Sunday of course. I called in a non-emergency call and they returned it at 8am the next morning. By noon that day, a simple thermocouple on the water heater was replaced. Hopefully I have a few years before I have to call them back.

Was overall a pleasant stay. The staff and housekeeping ladies extremely delightful and very nice. The breakfast was the best that I've had we have many of the other motels in the area by far and that was the two definite reasons for my 4 stars. Slightly rough area and lots of police activity at all times.
