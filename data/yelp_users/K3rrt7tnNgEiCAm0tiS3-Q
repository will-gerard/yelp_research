I have been seeing Laura for years now and she is the only one I trust with my hair.  She is awesome and always makes herself available.  She is extremely professional and very easy to get along with and had fantastic ideas to do with my hair that come out better and better every time.  She knows what she's doing it shows.  Highly recommended!

I have never experienced this type of customer service in any place I have ever been every single one of the staff here are so helpful, so amazing, and truly make an experience like buying a cigar like you were making one of the most important purchases of your life. They truly care about each individual who walks in there and what their needs are. On multiple occasions I have gone in there with specific requests and they have thrown in free cigars or done something over the top because they can.  not only is there customer service amazing but they have such a large and great selection that can't be beat. If you are interested in purchasing cigars or have never even purchased them these people are exactly the people you need to go see.   I will never buy a cigar anywhere else again.

Very under impressed.. Food was average and that is being generous.. Not to mention there was a hair in my food and they took it back, came back out and claimed it was "cheese" and still was charged for it.  The bathrooms are also disgusting.  Save yourself the time and go down the street to Carambas.
