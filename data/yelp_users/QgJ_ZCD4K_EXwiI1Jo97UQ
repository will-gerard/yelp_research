I've been going to this store a lot beginning of the year. Staff was always extremely helpful and nice. Owner is there almost always, ready to address and help with anything possible. After few months I went there again, just to send fax and to my surprise they almost doubled the price?! I'm sorry, I just can't go over the fact that they charge $2.21 to fax one page locally (for comparison, it is not more than $1.50 anywhere else). I just don't like that nitpicking and trying to make money on stupid petty stuff. I was making extra effort and going off my way to come and do my business here, and I'm sorry but that won't happen again.

I like Sky Harbor! And it is only getting better. No nonsense, no horrible crowds, easy access, lots of parking, easy to get around and plenty of places to kill time before flight. I'll take it over ORD any time!

I don't feel like there is much to review for Walgreens. I mean they are all the same, aren't they. This one is pretty clean, nicely laid out, cashiers are not slow and/or incompetent - that's all I need from Walgreens

I am a fan, although I'm not sure why. It is overpriced and nothing special, but I still go there from time to time. Definitely not a place to do your regular grocery shopping if you're on a budget. But I am sort of a health freak and I'm really glad Whole Foods market exists.

My first few classes went by quickly, I had no interest or desire to spend any extra time examining the campus. Now that my classes are getting more serious and I am spending more time at GCC, I must admit it was a very nice surprise. Library has great resources, HT1 and 2 always have available tutors (courses and levels have set schedule), student center is great place to kill some time, there is a lot of outdoor area to sit and chill. Every class and instructor I had so far was just as demanding as it should be (again, depending on the level of study). Since I haen't really attend any other community collee in the valley I can't compare, but I would definitely recommed GCC

Thank God they decided to drop the idiotic Field kitchen concept and return to good ol' Sweet tomatoes. Good thing is that the new fancy remodel stayed, so it is very nice looking and enjoyable place to eat at. I am a fan of ST and finally enjoying this location again. However if you are planning to eat here, arm yourself with patience for restaurant filled with screaming kids and seniors at any given time.

Best thing about this place is that it's so close to my house! Other than that they are well priced ($18 pedicure) and more or less I am always satisfied with the work. It is clean and net, massage chairs, TV, magazines ... you won't be bored. They had few new employees that did not impress me, but I still keep coming back. If you're in the area, I would recommend going!

OK it's Big Lots. Don't expect too much. I know I don't go there for quality or everyday shopping. But when you need to buy broom for couple uses or gift for a kid I don't really know who is or what they want it is a great (read cheap) place to go. On occasions I get surprised to find some steals (Red Mill steel cut oats for $1.5, Downy dryer sheets $2). Be smart about your shopping, check the dates on food items and don't expect everlasting quality - then enjoy your shopping at Big Lots

I love IKEA. It's the lifelong kind of love. Anywhere I traveled, anywhere I stayed for more than a week - if ikea was there I visited. It was my lunch splurge place in college days as much as design and organizing Mecca. I love that it gives different styles in world of lazyboy chairs. I love that the prices are more than reasonable. I love that you can find everything for small and large spaces. Yes I've heard the lame "but its lacking quality" excuse, and let me tell you that everything I bought is still looking great. Truth be told I never bough couch or mattress there, but bookshelves, tv stands, kitchen cabinets - all looking great. The only thing that sucks is that I get depressed coming home and seeing that my place looks nothing like one of the wonderfully designed showrooms (yet!). I will definitely be back, more than once

It definitely is as good as it gets. I drive from NW Valley every Wed for produce. Great choice, fresh and yummy. And the prices ... wouldn't get better deal even if Walmart had such great organic produce. Out of all farmers markets in the Valley this one is by far my favorite!

I'm really surprised by all the bad reviews. I used this car wash a lot when I lived in the area about 2 years ago. My car was in dire need of a wash and I decided to stop by there. Again, wasn't disappointed. The whole thing took less than 20 min, guys were very thorough and everything inside and outside was squeaky clean. They exceeded my expectations completely when they cleaned every little coffee stain in the cup holders. For $12.99 that is a great deal! I've paid much more for less at other places. I will be back

Easy access to freeway, gas station and usual Costco goodies ... what's to complain about. Plus this Costco seems like it has little more options available, comparing to the one on I17/101. I've never experienced huge crowd or long lines at the check out, and that makes it even better.

What can you really say about starbucks?! Aren't they all the same. Well, basically yes. This one is nice, spacious, has few tables outside that don't feel crammed up together. Service was good and quick. The only reason why I'm reviewing this Sbux is because of the location. I was actually surprised, there were quite a few people inside and atmosphere was pretty nice, for a moment I totally forgot I'm in the Sun City.

Seems like more and more shops are closing. I don't go often, but every time I'm close by it surprise me to see half empty mall. All the good stores in the area are actually outside that mall, and from what it looks now soon enough it will be only Macy's and JCP there

I don't get the gelato obsession. No, it is not a real Italian gelato, just unreasnably expensive thicker fro-yo. And for the price of scoop, you can get a lot of goo d fro-yo!

I just recently discovered thrift shopping. Yes, I know, it's as if I was living under the rock. Anyhow, I think this is mu favorite thrift store. It is wide, has good selection and almost always some discount is going on. I usually buy small kitchen appliances (why spend $80 on bread maker, when they have several great ones to choose from, all for $6). Clothes is hit and miss, as it is with any thrift store, but if you have time and nerves to stop by often, there are some really nice finds there.

I love this store. Even during the busiest time of the year, everyone is still smiling and making you feel comfortable. I usually come in to send fax. You wouldn't believe how unpleasant experience that can be, especially when store is busy. I've never experienced any sort of discomfort, wait, or anything negative in this store. Definitely recommended.

I like the ambiance and atmosphere a lot. It doesn't matter - lunch, brunch, dinner, drinks ... anytime I went it was fun. The closed "patio" area is really nice, one of those places where you still can keep up the conversation without yelling, but it isn't silent and boring. When it comes to food, I wasn't impressed at all. Ceasar salad is good and that's about it. Other menu items I tried are just plain average - in one word disappointing. Had Vigazz burger, Salmon salad, The Trifecta - only thing in common for all of them is that they vere very bland and missing taste. However Vig Pinot Noir is highly recommended. I will be back

Well it's an nice place. I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, but since Yelp still doesn't allow half stars (seriously Yelp, do something about it!), 4 stars it is.   I was meeting a friend for a laid back Sunday afternoon coffee. I have never been here before, and I always like exploring new places. Atmosphere inside was good, although little too quiet. Don't get me wrong, there was music playing, but everyone was so into their iPads and Macs that I was afraid to talk without half whispering. There is couple of tables outside and eventually we moved there. I like that barista/owner brought the coffee to our table which was a nice touch.  Coffee is very good. They offer soy, almond and rice milk also. I still take mine with just plain ol' cow's milk, but I thought that was a nice touch for all those coffee hipsters. There is variety of pastry, looked good but I haven't tried any. However, it is pricey, so if you're in the mood to spend money on good coffee, this is you place.  I live way far from Echo Coffee, but if I am in that area again, I will probably stop by (provided I'm not in frugal mood)

The slowest chipotle by far, be ready to wait ...  It was Saturday evening and the place was packed!!! The line was going out the door. I am used to long lines at Chipotle, but they usually move pretty fast. People who work there are always very quick and on top of their tasks. Well not the case here. I understand that work area needs to be cleaned and more food ordered, but when you have 20 people waiting in line forever you have to move. My bf walked over to Paradise Bakery, waited in line there, had his sandwich prepared, walked back and still waited about 5-8 minutes with me. Only I I wasn't that hungry, no way I would wait that long

I usually don't like to review places unless I've been there at least twice, but now I'm making an exception. And second star is merely because food is organic.  First of all, I need to say I wanted to check this place forever. Heard so much hype about it that I pretty much decided for everyone that's where we're having lunch. We came in on Saturday (2 adults and child). It was busy but we got seated almost immediately. And after that everything went downhill.  Our server was either the rudest or the most incompetent one I have ever had. Still can't decide which one of those is the case. My bf ordered espresso shot, he started listing all the drinks made with espresso shots. Asked him about specials or signature dishes, mumbled that everything is there. It got to the point where I was uncomfortable to even ask him a question.  For food I had ahi tuna melt sandwich, bf ordered The Affaire salad and kiddo grilled sandwich. Out of all three, grilled sandwich was the only decent choice. Salad was looking very nice, and that's about it. No dressing, a loot of lettuce and nothing more. After one bite, bf said he's returning it. Tuna sandwich was messy and greasy. And just plain ok. Supposed to come with house salad, which I am assuming was the 2 pieces of lettuce, carrot and corn on a side was.   At the end we waited extra 10 minutes for our check and it did not come until bf went and found server. At that point we were so frustrated and just wanted out. He did took the salad off the bill, but bf went home hungry.  Well bottom line is that I will probably not go back. Service was lame, food was lame and the whole experience was not better at all.

I was meeting a friend in the  area and after checking on Yelp, decided this is a place to go. When I first saw the place I was surprised, wondering if there is any space inside coz sitting outside in August is huge no-no. Luckily, there was enough room and I got there just minutes before it got too crowded.  Bottom line is I really liked the place. It is nice, urban, cool and most importantly not Starbucks (or Coffee Bean). Cappucino is great, finally got a nice drink in a mug! I like the menu, I like the atmosphere and I will definitely be back. Can't wait for cooler weather to try out the patio as well.

Almost three years after my initial review, I keep coming back and loving 32 Shea more and more. For me it really is as good as it gets. Coming from place where coffee shops are staple of human relationships, sterile Starbucks cafes were easily to bore me to death. I love the vibe 32 Shea has, I love the breakfast burrito and nutella cheesecake, I love meeting my friends there... It is not just another corporate kiss-ass place where everyone give you fake and empty smiles. I see myself coming back here for years to come!

I just realized my kid is becoming Old Navy poster child. As long as mom can score some bargains, that's ok. I started shopping at Old Navy just recently. It is one of those stores you know exist, but you never get inside. And I'm glad I did. There is always something on sale, either it's adult jeans for $15 or kid's winter jackets for $20. For boy that will grow out of it in a few months, I really don't want to spend more. I think there is enough selection for adults too. Maybe it's not a greatest quality, but it holds good after dryer and it's affordable, no brainer there.  This specific location is not the largest, but it has enough to choose from. It is bright and spacious, what else do you need

I gave them several chances, really wanting to have better experience. But every time I leave unsatisfied. Food is either bland, or so salty that it's inedible. They don't have that many meatless options, which is kinda lame. I do like the price however, last time 2 of us had lunch for $13 which is awesome, but next time I will probably just stroll the Camelback to Paradise bakery or some other soulless chain with slihtly tastier food

And now after everything they keep sending me bill, after the doctor and MA on the front office confirmed that I won't be charged for the second visit. Of course, whenever I call I get someone who has no idea how to respond to my questions and keeps promising I'll get a call back. Urgh ...

I love Sprouts! I try to do majority of my grocery shopping there and I welcome any "new" Sprouts."New" because honestly I didn't notice much change between Sunflower and Sprouts. Layout is the same, items and product similar, and for me that is a good thing. What I hate the most is when I learn order and where is what, and than everything in the store changes.   First time I shopped there (since it became Sprouts) it seemed to me that the prices are spiked up a bit, comparing to other locations. Now I think that Sprouts in general is getting more expensive than it was 6 months ago, but it is still worth it.  Organic section is nice and there is always something on sale (like 3lbs bags of apples for $1.99 - yes please!). They have nice variety of greens and decent size gluten-free stand with all of g-f items in one spot. Talk about convenience!   All in all, I think it is maybe a bit better equipped than other Sprouts locations and probably serves as a model where other stores are aiming to be. I am a fan and will continue to shop there.

OMG! I couldn't understand what the fuss is about, until my first bite of red velvet bundlet. And I was never a fan of red velvet cake ... I love and hate the fact that it's located just across the street from work.  The cakes are fresh, moist and yummy. Frosting is sweet and little strong but totally enough for the size of cake. There is a bunch of flavors for every taste. My recommendation is White chocolate raspberry, but everyone can find what they like. Prices are ok and keep in mind that one bundlet is enough for 2 people.   The store is cute, just as you would imagine it should be. I've always received nothing but polite and good service. Every day there is different samples to taste, so if you are in the neighborhood definitely take advantage of that. I don't see that this location is very busy but I definitely hope that will change and they will not end up closing the store after some time.

I finally got to use my LS coupon. And I think I found my future go to place for manicure! Danielle did my nails. I was surprised to read there is another girl working, I thought there is only one. Nevermind that.   I had coupon for gel manicure and parafin treatment. Best of all it was done in 40 minutes. And there wasn't even one sloppy or rushing move on her part. Danielle is very nice, welcoming, focused on work but still in the mood to chat just enough so it's not boring. I am extremely pleased with how she did my nails and I will definitely be back. And best of all, regular price for gel manicure is just $25!!!  The only confusin thing might be to find the salon. It is located in the Total Image Beauty Plaza on East side of 7th St, just before B.Home. Once you find it, you'll keep going back for sure.

I don't even know where to start! Disgusting is the only word to describe the taste.  Custard filled donut tastes like stale sourdough roll with tiny speck on custard in it and hardened, old chocolate frosting. Yes, it was 3pm, but even grocery store donuts at 10pm don't taste this bad, not even close. I had to spit the only bite I took and chug down coffee to mask the taste.   Regular glazed donut was hot, because of the glaze, but stale. God knows how long it has been sitting there, days for sure.  The service wasn't anything special either, quiet guy that does his job and avoids any extra questions or answers.  This was not my first Krispy Kreme donut, but I can guarantee it is my last!

As a Bosnian myself, I can't believe that I found this place by seeing the segment on them on Food Network! What a shame it took me so long to discover them.  The menu isn't huge, basic and simple. But the things they make, they are the best at it. Pies (burkes) are fantastic and as close to homemade as you can get in Phoenix, all for a reasonable price. They offer nice variety of breads, something for everyone, all fresh and made right there. Can't beat that! And as a cherry on top, there is a small selection of European goods, just to cure homesickness.  All in all, this is a bakery, so know what to expect, grab a great bread for breakfast or burke for lunch. Of course they will run out of fresh bread later in the evening, more kudos to them for keeping everything fresh and not piling up stale products.

I am definitely a fan. Very nice sized personal pizza with whatever topping you want. Crust  could be a bit less oily, but I choose to overlook the detail. Good tomato sauce and bunch of veggies is all I ask for in a pizza. Well at least from fast food pizza joint I turn to when I'm running on fumes.  Salads are pretty huge as well. If you're feeding more than one or two it can easily get very pricey, but to be fair the quality is far above Dominos or Pizza Hut.

Yes, I've been bitten by "come, enjoy and possibly take a nap in our recliners" bug. I hate to admit it as I really hate lazy boy chairs, but the recliners in a movie theater are an awesome idea. Another thing I hate are mall theaters, especially the ones with hidden, narrow, basement like entrance. Well apparently I hated them until I got to this one.  Took my son to see Frozen. It looked crammed when we opened the door and got in, but the line moved so quick that in about 30 seconds we were at the ticket counter. Impressive. I love that you pick seats, even tho we couldn't pick two seats together (that's what you get for being late). However the nice lady that had seat next to my son offered to switch seats with me - another win! Kids seem to like the soda machines, I like that it adds up to clean and upgraded look. The show rooms seem smaller than in other AMCs but I prefer that. The reclining chairs are nice and clean. Even if you put them all the way down, there is still about 12in space in front, in case someone needs to go by. I did not see any leftover popcorn or garbage.  The only thing that sucked is that bathrooms are really small, just 2-3 stalls. But hey, not everything can be perfect I guess

Love this place! Love the vibe, love the owner's story, everything about it. We went in for a lunch. I had tuna melt and hubs had salad. Both things were delicious and just large enough. Coffee was great, loved that espresso is served in ceramic cup. I hope they will expand lunch menu a bit. Parking can be a hassle but it's downtown, so it's kinda given. We will definitely be back!
