We held an open house for a client and had Udder Delights join us. They were a joy to work with and were kind and helpful to everyone. Casey and Frida were UDDERLY DELIGHTFUL! The event was great and nothing pulls people in like a food truck with quality ice cream. We will definitely be calling them again.

I love Postinos and have been a fan for many years and visited all of the locations throughout the valley.  I love the food as much as the vibe was thrilled when they moved into Downtown Gilbert.  They have been supportive and involved in our community and I wanted to thank them for supporting Gilbert Leadership, our Town and providing us an incredible lunch last week. Cheers Gilbert!

As always, you can count on Arizona Dukes of Air. We had a client that needed service for a leak in their air conditioning unit. Although it was Sunday and off hours the call was returned right away and they were cheerfully taken care of that day. That you for helping us look good too!

Thank you for catering the Woman in Business Chandler Chamber of Commerce event today. The BBQ lunch of pulled pork sandwiches and all the fixins was absolutely delicious. The staff was kind and efficient and I would definitely recommend your menu and service for a catering event.

I have had a lot of challenges with this practice and I should have looked at the reviews before selecting them.  My daughter has been going here for 2 years and the only thing that has been consistent is the poor service, no followup from voicemail and emails left, billing errors, mistaken charges and non-existent personal accountability. This is the first poor review I have done but I hope that it either helps Redemption Psychiatry evaluate their shortcomings and strive to get better or inform others so they can make a smart decision when choosing a doctor. After a lot of frustration and second chances, I will be finding an alternate solution for her care.

If you don't Snooze.. Then you Looze! Thank you for catering and supporting our Gilbert Leadership issue day for breakfast. It was incredible. I tried the Pineapple Upside Pancakes and they did not disappoint. I cant wait to go back!

I had the opportunity to visit Gilbert True Rest float spa over the weekend and brought my sister to join me. I am already looking forward to the next time.  I have floated before and absolutely love the benefits but it had been in a physical therapy setting and True Rest is so much more. From the moment I walked in it looked and felt like a luxury spa experience in addition I was impressed with the authenticity and  kindness of the owners & staff.  The audio jack allowed me to use my phone to play my guided meditations and I have experienced profound insights and healing in quieting my busy mind to listen. Be still, and know that I am God - Psalm 46:10
