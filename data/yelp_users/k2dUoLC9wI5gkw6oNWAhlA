This was my first time visiting Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. I thought that the concept of a noodle bar was interesting.   I was kind of unimpressed by the lunch menu. There weren't that many options and I had a hard time finding anything that jumped out at me. Many of the lunch options were for rice or salad. I really wanted noodles, ie a noodle bar.   I went for a Udon Combo Special with a California Roll. The roll was whatever, but the chicken in my soup was basic and kind of bland.   The food was average, but it was the service that left me unimpressed. The waiter was short and was very impersonal. He made my table feel rushed and as if we were an inconvenience for patronizing the restaurant. When we were ready to pay our bill, we asked for a spit check and he proceeded to tell us that he "couldn't do tax in his head" so basically too bad. We decided to spit the check 4 ways to be as easy as possible. Then as we were leaving he reprimanded us for not asking for a spit check before hand. I think it would have been nice for a server to be observant and ask us if we needed that rather than expect the table to make that known. A little foresight and customer service would have made a huge difference.

I can't be more pleased with Apple and this location. My iMac was making a crazy noise inside near the CD drive. I just brought it in not knowing that I needed to make an appointment for the Genius Bar. Unfortunately they were all booked up with other people. I get it. I made an appointment for the following day and was ready to walk back to my car carrying my giant box. While I was kinda annoyed at myself for not thinking to make an appointment before lugging that giant box all the way through the parking lot and across the entire Biltmore, my patience was restored when an employee insisted that he carry it out for me.   I came back for my appointment. They diagnosed the problem very quickly and said they would have it done in 3 days. I got a call the next day saying it was done. I went in picked it up and paid nothing as it was covered under my warranty. No need to show paperwork, no need to prove anything, no hassle. This is another reason I will always buy Apple.

I'm a pretty big fan of The Main Ingredient. It's off of a residential street and we love to ride our bikes over there. Their beer selection is pretty great and the food never disappoints. The BLT is a favorite of mine, although the salads are pretty stellar also. The only downside is that the service is spotty. I've had both great and less than average service experiences there. Also, the music is always pretty loud for such a small space. The atmosphere outside usually makes up for it as it's perfect for the AZ weather.

After Christmas wrapped up and the decorations were put away, I knew that my house could use a good cleaning, but in light of my son's recent allergy diagnosis and lingering dog dander from a previous pet, I knew I needed to call in the the professionals. I've never had my house cleaned by anyone besides myself and a reluctant husband, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I couldn't have asked for a smoother process and a more thorough job. Queen of Maids made the booking process easy through their website and the email confirmations were helpful. When I needed to change the time of my appointment fairly last minute, they were responsive to emails and earned my trust. Let me tell you what a luxury it was to come home to and quite the best way to start off the new year. I can't wait to use them again.
