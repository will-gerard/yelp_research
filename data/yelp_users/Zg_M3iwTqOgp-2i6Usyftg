I've eaten at Cherryblossom a few times before writing an official review, and each time I was usually with a group of friends, and each time we've had fantastic service and fantastic food!  Unfortunately, as I walked in with my sister after an outing at the Science Museum, the food wasn't as delicious as I remembered it to be - maybe this happened to be the, "Cheerleader effect." In a group it's good - but get it alone, and it's not as good as you thought it was.  Our waitress was nice, but scarce after receiving our food, and our second refill. There was very little people inside the restaurant as we arrived around 2pm.  I got the Ten-don, which is the tempura fried shrimp and ricebowl, being the hungry monster that I am, I ate the whole thing! It was a good and simple dish :)  My sister got the Katsu Pork Curry, and I noticed the plate was a bowl, no longer a deep plate that they used to use in the past. She wasn't happy with this dish as we've had better at another local Japanese restaurant; the curry didn't taste very much like curry, the sauce was bland, and she noted the piece of pork was small compared to the price she paid.  We ended up leaving after slipping the payment into the folder and didn't bother sticking around to wait for her to pick up the money.  I think this will be our last time eating at Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe while in Phoenix :(

Growing up in Phoenix this was THE place to go to get wings! Before their redecorating back in 09' it was very "cozy" and very "loud" (I'm saddened to see it "toned down" after the redecoration) on the outside.  This is THE place to go for a great deal on wings. 12 for $5? 50 for $24? Hell yeah man! They deep-fry them perfectly - they're still juicy in the middle; the mild, medium, hot, suicide, teriyaki, bbq, honey hot, is really delicious. My family and I love mixing up the teriyaki and medium sauce to give it a great sweet/hot/tangy flavor.  When I moved to Tempe, I missed the place; and the other ones - Mill (even though they closed, I still tried them)? Scottsdale? Mesa? Uh, no. Nowhere NEAR as fantastic as compared to the first and original Long Wongs in Phoenix, AZ. I've even ate at the Long Wongs Bars and Grills - the prices were too much for me, 6 for $5? No thanks. I love it as they also take your food to your seats, but always remember to clean up after yourselves! The trash can is the huge Hippo statue by the door ;) The staff and owners are really awesome and sweet, I love playing Pinball and the old retro 80's arcade games while waiting for my food.  The second best Long Wongs I would have to give props to is the one on Indian School Rd - we found this other gem while the original Long Wongs was still remodeling (and they had given a list of other locations).

So we ended up here last night for my sisters 17th birthday. This was our first time here after another relative said that the Macaroni Grill was really great.  It was Friday night around 6pm we arrived, a huge long wait, so we knew we'd be waiting for about an hour for 7 people +1 baby (highchair). There were a ton of other large families inside waiting to escape the cold, so we decided to wait outside with the rest of the families since there was no more room inside to sit and wait (we had wished they had heating lamps outside but there wasn't). We didn't mind, were pretty optimistic people when it comes to a 1st time restaurant experience!  We ended up waiting for 1 1/2 hours to be seated. My other sister walked in to ask for the wait time and whoever she talked to said we were only waiting for about 1/2 an hour which was a lie. Others got called and we were basically the only large group left to be seated which we found deterring. We made it inside because it was becoming too cold, it was dead empty, there were also empty tables around, so we couldn't understand why the waiters couldn't push two tables together to make a big one for us.  After being seated at the table around 8pm (mind we arrived around 6pm), the waitress was nice but not very attentive. There was already the given gratuity tip because of our group of over 6 people, so we didn't know if she was just busy with other customers or just didn't care.  Things that were ordered: Carbonara & Ginger Soda (me), Penne Rustica & Coconut Italian Ice (birthday girl), Eggplant Quadtani (mother), Mom's Ricotta Meatballs & Spaghetti (brother), Farfalle w/chicken & garlic sauce (don't remember the name, other sister ordered this). Everyone else ordered sodas or coffee.  Wait time.. we waited almost an hour for our food, they kept loading us up on bread. We didn't order anything that would take that long, all pasta dishes, the restaurant was half empty and the cooks were still there so there was no shortage of staff.  Carbonara & Ginger Soda: Was pretty good, although I'm not sure I like the idea of a poached egg on top (I'm the old fashioned and like it mixed together - just cook it up a bit to make sure the egg isn't raw anymore ;). It needed some salt but the prosciutto made up for it so I avoided adding anymore. But without mixing the dish, the noodles and "sauce" it came with was bland. The Ginger Soda was... interesting. It was good, but you couldn't taste the ginger, mostly the cream, lemon and lime. It kinda tasted like a Fizzy Limeade with cream than a Ginger Soda.  Penne Rustica & Coconut Italian Ice: Birthday girl was upset it came with 3 small shrimps, overall she enjoyed it but wished there was more shrimp for the price you paid for. The Italian Ice was good, a lot of coconut flavoring, she ended up ordering two since she liked it so much.  Eggplant Quadtani: It was alright, nothing to write home about.  Mom's Ricotta Meatballs & Spaghetti: This arrived to my brother cold, we alerted a different waitress who took the dish back to be reheated. When our original waitress came back (after 30min of being MIA from giving us our drinks, another waiter gave us our food) she asked if everything was alright but didn't ask about the missing dish. We kept trying to find another waiter or waitress, but they had suddenly all disappeared - or they were conveniently ignoring our table. 15min later we caught our waitress again and said we were waiting for his dish to be reheated. The waitress apologized and found his dish, when she brought it back the pasta was hot but the meatballs were still cold. We were offered a new Spaghetti dish which we gladly accepted, but it was still charged to our bill while the other wasn't.  Farfalle w/chicken & garlic sauce: Was good, but it had a very raw garlic taste, she wasn't too thrilled over the dish.  When we were nearing 10pm we were ready to leave. It took the waitress almost half an hour to get back my friends credit card and receipts when the place had about 6 other tables for the night. Before we left, we finally let it slip that it was my sisters birthday (maybe if we let it slip earlier maybe we would've gotten better service? I think not...), and the waitress had a deadpan of, "Fml." on her face. The guy who sung the opera to her was pretty good though.  Overall, for the wait we had to endure, and pay a large bill with not even sub-par food, we would've gotten better customer service and food at Olive Garden or even Carraba's. I know we're not supposed to mention other food chains in our reviews on Yelp, but it has to be said. If Macaroni Grill doesn't step up their customer service and food staff, this location might as well close as their other location on Ray.

Stopped by today with my sis for some much needed wings and cheese (mozzarella) sticks!  It's a stand alone building which was awesome, parking was spacious, and they have a drive through! We parked and went inside though, clean place, big windows to look outside when eating, and a TV that was playing the game while we waited for our food. The cashier took our orders, although it was kind of hard to hear what he was saying (maybe he just didn't have his cup of joe yet...) but overall, the food was great like everyone has said before me!  When I'm around Mesa again, I'll deffinitly stop here to get my wing fix again!

My friend suggested Los Favoritos and since we were in the area, I was intrigued. Upon entering there, the place wasn't very busy, but I assume that most of their business happens after people get off of work since they're open until 12am.  They have many booths for you to sit at, and it's not cramped at all. It's a very open area with a high ceiling and light coming in from all sides from the large windows. Across the way sits Starbucks, so if you want a nice ritzy coffee to accompany your Mexican food, you can head over there for a sweet treat.  I ordered the Cheese Enchilada and Beef Taco combo, it took some time for our orders to come out (aside from us there, there were about two other people there, but they were already eating), after we got our orders, we picked up the red salsa and left.  The food, ehh... it was good, but it reminded me of the other Mexican food joints around here. The Beef Taco is shredded beef, which was good (to me). The cheesy enchilada was cheesy and yummy, but for the price that was paid I expected two enchilada's, not one. The rice was ok, nothing great, I've had my share of Mexican fried rice and haven't found one that I have yet to like (except my fathers). Refried beans were good, but tasted like they came from a can. But like I said before, it tasted like the other restaurants.  I would not mind eating here again, they have a variety of things to eat and try, so maybe next time I will try something else!

First time coming to Carrabas with the family, we were greeted at the door by a waiter and waitress (holding the doors open), we were seated immediately - given that it's Mother's Day and all!  Upon deciding our food, our waitress was really sweet and very helpful in explaining how Carrabas' menu was setup! After getting the Calamari and the Mozzarella sticks for our appetizers, we were blown away with how delicately the Calamari was seasoned and fried, and how the Mozzarella stickers were seasoned and in rectangles - different than your usual cylinder shaped sticks. Our food came hot and ready, I ordered the Seafood Cannelloni - hot and sooo delicious; worth the $13 I paid for it!  They also had a nifty give-away for Mother's Day - you received a $10 Gift Card (free after your meal) to use on your next visit because of the holiday! It was really sweet and nice of them to do this! My mother was really happy in the end and we will defiantly be coming back!!

My sister and I ate here during happy hour today (9/22/2014). Kona Grill has always looked busy whenever we went to Chandler Fashion - it was always packed inside and out (in the patio area). They have a huge aquarium near the hostess station and a small boothed seating area while you wait to be seated.  So, after wandering in for happy hour, we looked around for a host/hostess. None were to be found! We looked over at the sushi bar where there were a couple of sushi chef's there prepping or something, but I'm sure they saw us two waiting by the station to be seated. A waitress soon came by and asked if we were going to be seated inside for happy hour, or wanted to be outside in the patio area. We said inside and she promptly sat us at a booth. A few seconds later a waiter came by and asked us if we were there for happy hour, in which we replied with yes. He then stated that happy hour was only in the patio and that we had to move tables. Confused, my sister told him what the waitress had said, and he said that she was in the wrong and they don't seat happy hour customers inside.  So off to the patio we went, we were told that we would be brought menus again, we picked a random table and thought the waiter was following us with menus, but when we sat down, menus, and waiter/waitress, were nowhere to be found. As we sat awkwardly for about five minutes outside, our original waitress appeared! Handed us menu's and asked us what we would like to drink (water and a sprite). After she had left, my sister leaned over and said, "They forgot about us. The bartender saw and told someone inside that there was a table not being waited on." Thank you Mr. Bartender for dragging our waitress back to doing her job!  We ordered the BBQ Flatbread, Chicken and Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, and my sister got the Crunch Roll Sushi. The BBQ Flatbread is spicy, so watch out! The Lettuce Wraps were very good, they use butter lettuce for the leaves, and the peanut sauce that comes with it is also spicy and has a kick which leaves you craving for more. My sister was not impressed with the sushi, it was good, but nothing to really rave about. The food did take a while to get out, we only ordered three simple dishes, and they brought my sister tap water... so yeah, there's that to think about the next time you order water on a weekday.  By then more people had arrived to eat, and it started to pick up. We saw others seated around us, and other waters and waitresses bustling around us. Our waitress refilled our drinks and then disappeared! I saw her maybe one more time waiting on another table that was not far from us, they too were waiting for what seemed like a while like we did for service after they were seated.  And, well, it was time to pack up, pay the bill, and finish our shopping! But... our waitress was nowhere to be found, again! We managed to get a small to-go box from her before she mysteriously vanished within the semi-empty restaurant. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Ten minutes later my sister and I looked at each other and said, "Let's just go. We can't even pay for our food, so let's go." but my sister managed to flag down another waiter and asked him politely, "Excuse me, I'm sorry, I know you're not our waiter, but we've been waiting for our bill for the last ten minutes." (it was pretty obvious we were ready to leave, we even stacked the dishes out of boredom) and after asking us who our waitress was, that's when we then realized she never gave us her name (go figure). We had to say she was one of the brunettes - and there was another brunette waitress also working there. But it looked like the guy knew who we were talking about (our waitress had permanent b**** face on, so). He apologized, brought us our bill, and when we stuck the CC in it, our waitress appeared! Whisked the pay away, came back, mumbled, "Thank you for eating here, have a good day." and walked off. My sis and I shook our heads in laughing disbelief, we've never had such a bad wait times on such a slow day!  So the next time we're at Chandler Fashion, we're going to be avoiding this place, and not be recommending it to anyone we know. I think we were better off getting something in the food court.

We went here on Valentines Day for a girls night out (being single doesn't mean you have to be miserable!), it was my first time at a YC's! Another friend of mine went to the one on Elliot, and she raved about it to me. I completely forgot until we went here on the 14th!  We arrived before they closed, what's nice is that they let you eat your fill if you don't pull a dick move and arrive at 8:45pm to eat with a large group. I'm not a big fan of buffets, after visiting one with my family in California, I became completely discouraged with the rampant shouting kids, claustrophobic tables and chairs that made you turn sideways to walk down isle, and some of us ended up with food poisoning since the waiters weren't keeping the place clean - but YC's has given me a good outlook on family sit-down buffets. At least, arrive after 8pm so parents have to take the kids home for bed on a weekday haha!  After paying we walked down the line, a lot of people were piling it up, my friend helped me figure it out which was really simple. The girl at the cash register was nice also and helped with the instructions on how to get the food.  One thing I really loved about YC's was that above the area where they fry your food up, there is a huge chalkboard on all the different Asian sauce mixes you can have for your dish! I ended up making Curry-yaki, and it was REALLY good, it reminded me of eating in a Japanese food court while in California!  YC's is a clean place, not loud and obnoxious after 8pm on a weekday, and people are polite while you're waiting for your food in line. I want to try this place out again so you can count on me coming back!!!

Got here around 7pm, the cashier got to us fast, asked if we knew what to do, and we were on or way to snag some yummy Mongolion Grill food!!!  There wasn't a long wait in line to grab food, or a long wait for them to cook your food! The resturaunt is clean, and the interior is roomy and doesn't feel cramped. They have vanilla, chocolate, or the vanilla chocolate swirl froyo in a cup or cone included with your meal.  The on on McClintock can't compare, but they are usually backed up with families. Since this location is a little more "hidden" you can enjoy a quiet night with family or friends while you enjoy your meal :)

I've been here twice; the first time I was nervous since I've never been to this place (I mean, what person ISN'T nervous when going someplace new), but Renee was wonderful to talk and work with in getting anti-scratch and glare on my lenses!  The second time I had scratched my lovely new lenses, and Renee helped me out again when I called and asked about getting it fixed!! I love this place and highly recommend anyone to give them a visit if they can't afford the bells and whistles that other name-brand eyeglass companies try to sell you!

Finding [delicious] Japanese bakery goods fresh is hard in AZ - you either find it, or you don't, there's no mid-way point! A friend of mine brought me here, it was my first time and I was looking forwards to it!  Upon entering the cute little bakery, it had a very light atmosphere, they have classical music playing, three table sets you can sit at (although I was hoping you could also sit outside to enjoy eating the sweets and the weather) and in the back through a window where they place the finished orders through, you can see the Patisserie making sandwiches or new bakery items! It's really fun when you're waiting for your food! I really love their curry bread ("an-pan" [or "pan"] in Japanese), I had bought a Fraise and it was REALLY good - the cream was "heavy" but also light and sweet, the strawberries were sour, but they complimented the cream nicely along with the strawberry jam and shortcake at the bottom. When we went back the next day they didn't have it - so I'm assuming they keep a rotated bakery menu so you always have to go back to see what new pops up! (Which, in my opinion, is very smart!)  Personally, the price for their deserts are set just right because of how high quality they are. I am going back when I have the free time to go again since I still have to try more of their menu!!

This place is a serious joke of a "coffee house"!  We came here because my sister had a hair appointment at Altered Ego, the [very] popular hair salon next door. After reading the 5 star reviews, we thought this would be a nice place to hang out while waiting for the hairdresser (before and during my sisters salon visit).  The outside looks inviting, a glass door with Solo Café in bold white letters (and other various stickers on the door) and two small patio tables and chairs outside. With Altered Ego next door, we thought it would be equally bright and airy like the salon. At first I was reminded of the small boutiques in downtown San Luis Obispo, CA!  So, appearances really ARE deceiving!  We walked in around 12:35pm, and if it weren't for the 7, 5yr old Apple Laptops Apple logo illuminating the shop, you could have sworn you walked into a dirty-looking dungeon. It's filled with college kids abusing the free WiFi, the drinks are overpriced and customer service is seriously lacking. And I totally agree with what others have said about "Zombie Hipsters", if you need them, they're here.  The decor is pretty bad. It looks like they started with an India theme turned Bohemian, turned goth, and tried real hard to turn modern but failed miserably. Ambiance is not there whatsoever, when I walked in everyone in the place looked at me (silently judging, anyone?) then turned their attention back to their laptop screens. Since the place isn't lit very well (hence the 7 Apple icons lighting up the entire place like nightlights), it's like a shop that serves you great coffee while you can watch porn on your laptop and no one can see your face properly and recognize you (lol).  The tables and booths crowd the entire floor, there is a small common sitting area with a dingy looking couch and cushions, no one was sitting in it and it was obviously just taking up space. Standing around while waiting for the customer in front of us to order (who apparently couldn't make up her mind on WHAT to order), we ended up bumping into other customers who were getting up to talk to their friends, or other customers who entered and were waiting in line behind us. You're seriously bumping elbows here.  The woman at the cashier had the rudest attitude I've ever met at a coffee house! She had a bored look on her face that seriously said, "I don't f***ing want to be here right now." Their menu sits in the far back on the right hand wall, there are NO lights highlighting the menu or any of their teas (in which you'd think they'd be proud to show off since it looks like fresh homegrown and dried tea leaves). She didn't greet us when we walked up to order after the first customer, and just stared at us like she was staring at a wall.  We wanted Italian Sodas since it's a pretty warm day, and they sounded real nice to have. She blatantly said, "We don't have ANY Italian Soda today." like we were out of the loop and we should've obviously known there was no Soda water today! Wow, I was pretty shocked at her reply, and was pretty shocked when she looked over her shoulder at the Barista and said, "I've been turning away 20 customers because we don't have ANY soda water." and the guy shrugged, like he can do something about it? He's making the coffee's! It's a Saturday afternoon, and you don't even have the proper ingredients stocked and then in the middle of helping customers tell the Barista that you're out of said ingredient in front of everyone in the coffee house. When we asked what teas they had, she drawled out, "Whatever we have is on the wall." and we were seriously caught off guard, said an uncertain, "Oh... okay..." and ordered.  Sister ordered a White Chocolate Mocha, she liked it but wished there were more for the price she paid (I'm guessing whipped cream since she's a girly girl and likes those types of drinks). My mother ordered a Cranberry Breeze Iced Tea which was really good. But not even the good coffee and iced tea could make me give this place 2 stars.  I was turned off once the woman gave us each a surveying look. Didn't order anything and walked outside because of this place, I was trying really hard not to laugh in her face because of the sh*tastic service we were getting. The small coffee bar wasn't even cleaned or the trash thrown out.  I would seriously save my time and money and go to the coffee house on Southern and McClintock (across the plaza from Sunflower Market) for a better atmosphere, clean tables and chairs, and a more enjoyable staff than this place.

Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.  I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.  Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.  Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.  I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.  All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time.

This place is EXCELLENT. It's seriously buzzing, and the cooks and employees are always kept on their toes to provide excellent service and a clean place to eat; indoors and outdoors! They had heating lamps outside since it was chilly which was awesome!  The only thing I wish they had was a bigger inside, it was packed inside and it was hard to grab condiments (lettuce, salsas, guac, etc) without bumping into other people's elbows :(  Other than that, this is seriously a great place to get Mexican food that I've been to yet!!

This place was good, but not as great as others are making it out to be... I've had better in the West Valley, East Valley, and down south in Tucson. It wasn't very busy when we went, I mean we got our food pretty quick despite the amount of people and a rather large family that was there too.  The food was under seasoned, and the drink and condiment station was a huge mess. I ordered enchiladas as I opted out of the tamales, originally we had wanted to order the Menudo, but they only served it in the mornings of Saturday (we were here on Saturday night) so... hm. Not a fan.

This is my first time at not only Yogurtland, but this type of place where you get your own Yogurt from a machine! At first I was intimidated but my friend helped me through the process of creating my own frozen yogurt treat. The best way to not be shuffled along a line is to just go right for the flavor you want; why be held up behind a person who is getting Vanilla when Peanut Butter (my current favorite) is all the way near the end? Just go get it! Don't wait! But be polite if you're squeezing in between someone!!  The flavors rotate everyday - you never know what will pop up unless you go to the http://www.yogurt-land.com/ website to view all their flavors and hope they have the one you want to try when you arrive *lol*! The toppings at the end of the station usually change but not as much as the frozen yogurts! The staff is great to chat with, the atmosphere is great also - it's always busy with college kids and families, and I love it because they're open so late on the weekends! You can also eat outside which we love to do because we can be as loud as we want!  So if you're by ASU or in the Tempe area, you defiantly need to give this place a try if you're in the mood for frozen yogurt!

Panchero's Mexican Grill looked interesting to eat at, I love how they prepare their tortilla's in the big presser they have - but that's the only thing that impressed me; the tortilla's... Since they're freshly made, they're still yummy and "gooey" - The staff was really nice when we entered, and was attentive to what we wanted for our orders :)  I got a pretty basic burrito but was disappointed at the rice, the other two people in our party compared it to Uncle Ben's rice, the steak we got seemed "boiled", the medium salsa wasn't as spicy as I thought it was (but they do have a counter filled with different hot sauces; of course I grabbed the Tapatío), although the salsa was flavorful. My friends had ordered a chicken quesadilla - they were good but not great. It seemed they only had Montery Jack as their cheese. The prices were pretty decent, I think next time I will try something else though!

This place is fantastic! I walked in expecting to see stereotype Asian decor but I was blown away! It's modernized decor fit the food perfectly, they have free WiFi and these cool long tables and tall chairs that at first the tables just look long for decoration, but then I realized it has another use: catches your flicks of soup so it doesn't land on another person (LOL)!  Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself here; ordering was a bit intimidating, since it was my first time here. My friend was with me and walked me through it, it was a breeze! The guy who took our orders was nice and chatty, we sat, and our food came out fast - I was pretty impressed with the setup, really nice, modernized, and delicious.  The ramen is flavorful, the bean sprout crunchy, the carrots crunchy, the spinach delicious, and the noodles are al dente and then when they sit in the bowl at the bottom, it soaks up the broth and the flavors of whatever else you ordered as another topping! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

Nnnnooooo, my family ordered take-out from this place yesterday (12/24/2015). Aside from the place being empty, fam was still hopeful it would taste good.  We got the Ya Shan Beef, Orange Beef, and the House Chow Mein. We got 1 box of rice(???), Ya Shan Beef was way too watery and had no flavor, House Chow Mein had no flavor, and the Orange Beef was seriously over salted, and way overcooked, we ended up trying to mix it up with the Chow Mein to get past it!  The portions are small compared to other Asian restaurants we've eaten and had take-out from. For $27 tax included, we got 3 "Chinese take-out"-sized boxes and 1 "Chinese take-out"-sized box of rice :\ For that price we were better off going to our regular place we usually order Chinese at!  So yeah, not coming back here again

We ate here last Friday (6/6/14) with family and friends (6 of us in total). We were sat immediately when we entered. Since we wanted something quick, and "cheap" (lol, it's downtown Phoenix, nothing is "cheap" there!), this was the place we ended up at.  Inside they have high ceilings, and lamps that drop from them, the lamps were fun to look at and a great way to start a conversation. They have two large TV's on either side of the restaurant so you can watch the game at the bar or while eating. They also have an outdoor patio with misters if you want to eat outside.  The booths are made for large groups. Even small groups are grouped with other spots in the large booths, the only way to have an individual table is if you ate outside, or got a table for two along the wall. The Strand is almost a hole in the wall restaurant, it's thrown under Tilted Kilt, and sitting next to The Arrogant Butcher, so it's rather overlooked by a lot of foot traffic.  Their menu is large, everything from salads to pastas to pizzas and drinks thrown into the mix. Orders were: Chicken Alfredo, Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, Burger, Salmon Dish, Salad.  I tried some of the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, it's spicy but good at the same time, it came to us with the cheese still bubbling and piping hot. The Chicken Alfredo is a simple dish, nothing to write home about, but I wanted something simple that night! I stole some of my mother's Parmesan fries from her plate, they didn't have a Parmesan taste, but they were really crispy and tasted good when dipped in their basil vinaigrette dip they bring to you with some bread while you wait for your meal to cook up.  Our waitress was a doll, she kept our cups filled and made sure we had everything. We chatted with the manager afterwards for a little bit too, if I'm in need for some easy Italian food around the Convention Center again, I'll be stopping by here!

We stayed here the past weekend for a local event, the pros was that Glendale Glitters was going on and it was super easy to park the car in the lot and walk over to it (it's right across the street)!  It's centrally located, had great access to the GG event and has some small house cafe's around it - although we never got the chance to visit those since we were mostly there for business and not leisure :(  This motel bumps right up against the railroad tracks (the cinderblock wall does little to keep the noise down to a low). We kind of overlooked this since we're used to trains but the most busiest you will hear that train horn is around 8pm to 11pm and 6am to 8am. I slept like a log so I barely heard the train horn, but my other two business partners heard it clear as day and did not like it at all.  The doors, walls, and windows are thin. We could hear our neighbors through our [locked] connecting door between our rooms because they were being loud... and you can hear people outside the room run, talk, laugh, etc. My other partners mentioned that a fight had broken out (of course I slept through it) and was about to call the police until it died out... There was also a woman carrying a dog who would wander around in the parking lot for no reason. But some guests will stay up past 10pm, we heard children running around outside our door well until 11pm as well as other guests talking at the end of the hall.  Cable, WiFi (when not bogged down by other guests), hot/cold water, microwave, heater (we didn't use the AC haha) and mini fridge worked fine! Toilet/Shower area ran small, but the cleaning staff made our beds and cleaned up our room whenever we were out!  Our key cards only worked when we got them right from the front desk. On all 4 days we had to ask for new key cards because they didn't work when returning back to our room.  It's a pretty well-worn Motel 6, you do get what you paid for, the front desk was very nice to us though, and apologized with the key card mishaps.

Oh man..  Oh man...  OH MAN!  Insert Homer J. Simpson drooling .gif here pls.  I was with my sis whilst we fought against the pre-Christmas Rush War that was happening within the Chandler Fashion Mall parking lot, as we finally managed to exit the lot, our tummies rumbled loudly. We needed substance, substance that was deep fried, walked on two legs, and had two wings! Thank you Yelp App for showing what's around us, or else we'd be stuck at another fast food burger joint that we did not have a desire for.  So as we made our trip over, and getting slightly lost because GPS decided that the restaurant was right where a newly built school was, we found this small place, parked, and lumbered into ATL Wings!  As we walked up to the counter, staring at the menu above, the cashier said hello to us and asked if we've been there before. We admitted it was our first time there, and she gave us a sample of the Honey Habanero sauce - sweet with a kick - and I knew what I was going to get!  We ordered our wings, sis added the Cheese Fries, and we waited. We were pretty excited, this place had a ton of reviews, all around the 4 star mark! Our wait came to an end as the lady came out from the kitchen, wings piping hot, and fries sitting right next to them, drenched in a glorious thick yellow goo we've all known to love when melted, CHEESE!  Wasting no time, we sank our teeth into these glorious wings, we looked at each other and knew, this place was a keeper!! The wings have a great amount of meat on them, and are fried perfectly. They're tossed with just the right amount of sauce, nothing dripped and there was no pool of sauce left behind as we polished them off one by one. The Cheesy Fries we crunchy, yet still soft in the middle, they leave the skins on when frying them up, and they were just perfect! It reminded me of the fries you get at the State Fair, beautiful.  To end our wing feast, my sis ordered the Honey Biscuits, which are more like light puffy donuts (Beignets), drenched in honey, powdered with sugar, lightly crispy on the outside and soft and warm on in the inside. Argh! I'm drooling at the thought of them as I'm typing this review! The only thing missing was some jam on those bad boys, I wanted to order another round, but our bellies were already packed full of wings and cheese fries!  Next time we're over in the area, we're definitely coming back!!

Been meaning to try this place out since I moved to Tempe (like, what, over 8 years ago now? I literally live 5min away, I'm so bad lol! Not that I'm saying it's been here for 8yrs, just that I've been in this area for that long, seesh, don't review at 1:30am folks) and after meeting up with Joyce W., Brett B., and Linh L. for the Lunch Bunch, it could not have come at the perfect time!  Honestly, all the feelings about this place is all in Brett B. and Joyce W. reviews. This place is AH-MAY-ZING! Cody was such an awesome server, I enjoyed the Chicken Basil Crepe (savory) and the Lemon Crepe (sweet & sour - which I love these combos!) and a free Maya Tea (iced) with my first check-in! We all shared what was on our plates and everything was delicious - from the Salted Radishes with the Cultured Butter all the way to the Homemade Chocolate that you swirl up in their own homemade Caramel Sauce!  Good food, good friends, crisp and refreshing atmosphere - inside and out - it made my Friday brighter, and I went home with a full stomach and rosy cheeks from all the laughter and good times I had with the group and the Crepe Bar staff (they rock)!  Definitely coming back here to try the rest of the menu out, cannot wait till that next paycheck rolls in!

Eh, we came to this place when everything had closed last Saturday (6/7/2014). The lot was pretty bare on a Saturday night after 8pm, so we were kinda wary but we were also really hungry. It also looked like it was closed since the windows are heavily blacked out with curtains, we had to look for their Hours Sign and saw they were open till 2am.  The decor inside is nice but has a club feel to it, the bar was closed for a private party when we arrived. There is a live DJ, but I think he was busy DJ'ing for the private party (which kinda got annoying because there would be a boom of music that was hard on the ears then it'd get turned down real low... not sure if that was the DJ or the private party messing around with the music), and the main dining room where we were seated was pretty empty. We had a large group of 6, and were seated ASAP though! The lighting is really dim (but looking at photos it looks well-lit??), and small candles are placed in the center of each table for ambiance. Menus were kinda hard to read in the dim light so it took a bit to be able to read everything.  What confused me was the items listed on the menu. The place is Asian Fusion/Thai, but there were things merged with Indian, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese food too. I know it's "Asian Fusion" but... when the menu is half a sheet of paper, I would have expected more plate options with the listed cultures I mentioned previously. Has a really nice list of vegetarian items, but when you're Asian, your diet is practically vegetarian, haha!  So we ended up ordering almost half the menu since, being Asians, we always order in large amounts to share with everyone! We ordered:  Bacon wrapped lychee (those who ate it said they would have preferred a fresh lychee as opposed to a dried lychee), bacon wrapped okra (those who ate it said it was good), oden noodles with bean sauce (eh, staple Asian dish), korean bbq (still sizzling hot in the pan), shrimp curry (which was really runny, had no flavor, random pineapple in it? and the spicy heat overpowered the dish), flat rice noodles (weird gummy, chewy texture, this is supposed to be like the Korean rice noodles "topokki" but they're not supposed to be gummy or chewy), fried tofu in some sauce (I missed the name of it, but it's fried tofu, can't go wrong there!), potstickers (eh, you can't really screw up potsickers, they're a pretty simple and staple dish in any Asian restaurant), and the sugar cane pork (sugar cane absorbed all the liquid from the pork, so the meat was dry, and I felt like I should be eating it in wonton soup instead).  Everything was ehhh OK, the portions are really meant for 1 person, not to really share with a large group, but we wanted to try everything that sounded interesting to us! But really, the price we paid we honestly could have gone to an Asian restaurant and for the same price get huge heaps of food on plates to share.  Sochu House staff was really friendly, our waiter was attentive and gave us great explanation on things we were curious about, but other than that, this place wasn't really a home run for us and we probably won't be back. Sorry!

My sis wanted a cupcake after a day of shopping, and we've always seen Gigi's pink sign from the street when we passed by so we decided to swing in on our way home~  The guy behind the counter was super nice and helped us out since it was our first time here; he explained which cupcakes were Buttercream and Cream Cheese frosting along with their flavors and whatnot. I ended up getting the Lemonberry cupcake since I had been craving lemon things all day since it was so hot! My sis grabbed the White Midnight Chocolate cupcake, and Raspberry Chocolate.  Unfortunately, even though these cupcakes are cute and very neatly decorated and pretty in the window, they did not taste as good as they looked... The cake was dense, and the Buttercream and Cream Cheese frosting had so much sugar mixed into it, it just tasted like regular sugar frosting. My Lemonberry cupcake had more sugar than lemon flavor in it so :( The Midnight Chocolate, according to my sister, was not good to her, and the Raspberry Chocolate didn't have much a raspberry taste either. The frosting was hard on the outside like others have mentioned in their reviews, but I'm not sure if that's because we did go in around 4:30pm and they were closing in half an hour.. or what..  It was fun to try, buuut not for us.

It's Carl's Jr, and by far this is the most awesome one I've visited yet! They opened this new location earlier this year, and were handing out the free coupon books for their grand opening, of course my sis and I each got one!  The place is clean and well lit inside, the workers are fun to talk with, and they're pretty fast when getting your order out. The cooks in the back take great care in getting your food out, everything comes to us fresh, hot, and nicely made - not squished as I've seen at previous Carl's Jr around the Valley!

This Carl's Jr blows, we were there for Phoenix Comicon for all 4 days. We went to this Carl's Jr for two days because we were swamped and didn't want to waste too much time on getting full meals to go.  The workers there expect you to order the full meals so they don't have to hit multiple buttons when you just want the burger itself. The first time I ordered for me and my group of vendors, the chicken tenders came out dark brown, to the point where if you left it in the fryer any longer, they would have burned. My burgers bun came to me burnt on the inside, but everything else seemed fine, but then again I had ordered meals for the rest while I just got the burger itself.  The second day, I ordered a Western Burger without sauce (sis wanted it that way, I have no idea what she was thinking lol), it came to us without sauce but also no burger patty! They had also switched out the chicken tenders I had ordered for someone else with a regular $6 burger (I'm assuming). Luckily the vendors didn't care since they were really hungry and I didn't over-pay on anything since $6 burger is more expensive than the chicken tenders.  I honestly have no idea how they could screw up so badly on our orders two times on two different days. Both days they weren't busy, and had enough staff. The second day I think the manager was working (she was the only one wearing regular clothes, not the uniform), and they still managed to screw up our order.  So if anyone goes to this place, make sure you double check your order is right, I don't think they can handle huge orders or even the lunchtime rush correctly, and it's a huge shame because I really like Carl's Jr a lot, just not this location.

This was my first time eating at a Fractured Prune! We have one in Tempe, but we were in Glendale for Phoenix Comicon Fan Fest weekend, and needed a sugary, salty, or both(!) treat!  They were running a deal on a free Pig Pen donut on their Yelp App page, so I snagged that while my mom got a Key Lime and both were DELICIOUS.  Will I come back to a Fracture Prune Doughnut in the future? You bet your doughnuts I will! And afterwards you'll see me walking home to work off those lovely calories I just deliciously ingested!

I love Glacier Snow so much!! This is literally the best place I've been to to get snow! The different flavors and toppings are awesome, and I'm glad this one is only 15min away!

Man oh man, do I love Portillo's. Before they moved into the Tempe Marketplace location, their other restaurant was located in Scottsdale - a bit too far for me (even if I'm at the halfway point)!  There are also a couple of other hot dog eateries around Tempe, but for Portillo's it's located right outside of Tempe Marketplace, so I can get my shop on after eating a hot dog (and lose all those calories I just consumed haha)! I come here with my family and we usually just order their hot dogs, my sister has tried their burgers and salads, but she wasn't a big fan of them.  The decor is a throwback to the poodle skirt era (hello 1950's!). It's large inside, and can sit large groups of people within your party. They have booths as well as open seated tables, I like grabbing a booth because it just seems more fun and retro for some reason, but I also like grabbing a seat by the windows because it feels like you're in a cafe. The best way I can put it is if you've eaten at one of Disneyland's restaurants, you have that soft comfort murmur of people outside and around you which I really like. If you can brave the 110 heat, you can also sit outside in their patio which is equally as large. There are fans overhead and the area is covered by a ramada to add to ambiance of eating hot dogs and burgers in your patio (or your neighbors). Eating outside of Portillo's is really nice during our cool months though, it's very enjoyable!  When you go to order your food, staff will be there to ask if you've eaten there before, if you haven't they'll explain the menu to you. When you order they write everything on paper bags - this way they know what you ordered and you won't get mixed up orders when you receive your food in the bags! You have to be attentive when they call your order out, they will not deliver your food to your table, so we usually wait around the window for our food or sit in the booth waiting for our number to be called. Numbers are not called in order, it's whenever the food gets out, so if you're one of those people who gets angry that number 85 got called before your 55, take a chill pill, because your food is coming out, just gotta have some patience!  The staff also makes up rhymes when your number is called, it's awesome! So far I usually order the polish hot dog with American cheese - but I can eat their crinkle cut fries and cheese sauce all. Day.

First time having a smoothie bowl - and I shared it with my sis since I have some digestive issues when eating certain fruits. We got the ASU one, with blueberry/banana/strawberry/granola and let me just say... I just want to shove the granola in my gob with a smoothie on the side to wet it lmao!  It was pretty good, my only complaint was that it was hot and stuffy inside... like we we were going in to do some hot yoga... the floor was kinda sticky where we were at too so *shrugs* our smoothie bowl was good and the gals behind the counter were nice and helpful too :) wouldn't mind swinging around when I'm in Tempe Marketplace again, but I'd rather eat outside in the heat where there's misters so I don't have to bother with the inside...

Sis and I popped on in here since we wanted to check them out since she saw them on Yelp, and I saw the shop when grocery shopping next door!  We ordered a Creme Brulee, which we ate there, and it was delicious! The sugar on top was perfectly torched (torched? Is that the right word?! Crispy? ANYWAY!), hearing the spoon crack into the soft and silky custard underneath was satisfying to hear! It was the most light, smooth, and subtly sweet Creme Brulee I have had to date. A war was about to erupt between us since it was so good, next time we'll order our own!  We also got a Tres Leche and Lava Cake to go (we wanted to share these pieces of gold with the rest of the family at home!), the Tres Leche is very yummy, it has caramel drizzled on top, and the cake and whipped cream is amazing with the condensed milk drizzled around the cake itself! The Lava Cake itself looks amazing, we haven't had a chance to break into that yet but I'm pretty sure, judging by the other reviews and photos we've see on their Facebook and Yelp page, it's also going to taste amazing!!  Next time we're going to try their panini's - which sound amazing!
