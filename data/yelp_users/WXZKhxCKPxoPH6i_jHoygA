Great little mom & pop gyros place.  The portions are huge and the food is always tasty and fresh.  I am a creature of habit, so I always only order either the Gyros sandwich or Chicken Shawarma Sandwich.  Both are excellent!

This is hands down the best restaurant in Arizona!  The food is perfect!  This is a dining experience that no one should miss!

The service was painfully slow, all of the food was under-seasoned.  My Halibut was dry and tasteless and I am pretty sure that the feta on the roasted carrot side dish had turned sour.  If we weren't having such good conversation with the other couple that we were with, the whole dinner would have been an epic fail.

I love this place and the new owner is very friendly!  Great selection and competitive prices.  You should definitely make this your go to cigar shop!

Very friendly staff, clean and well kept restaurant.  The food was good.  I had the Gyros Plate with a Greek Salad on the side.  The plate was served with a humus, tsatsiki, warm pita and a plentiful helping of gyros meat.  The salad was fresh and the dressing was simple but good.  My only complaint was the olives used for a garnish were canned black olives.  They really should be using kalamata olives not these lame flavorless olives.  I wouldn't let that keep me from coming back.  The food definitely satisfied my cravings.

I bought a used pool table this weekend off of Craigslist I used Billiards 2U to move it to my house. I can't say enough good things about them. They showed up on time, were friendly, clean and professional. They probably could have convinced me that I needed new felt or bumpers for several hundred dollars more, but instead said I would get many more years out of what was already there. If you need to move a pool table, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this company!

I couldn't be happier to find this place.  Great food and the most friendly people.  Christian and his mother Tanya made me feel right at home from the moment I walked in.  This could be my new favorite local spot!
