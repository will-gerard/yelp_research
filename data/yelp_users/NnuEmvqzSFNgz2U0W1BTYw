My husband and I have eaten here a few times and food good, good  service but today had to write???as we were pulling into the parking lot this lady was turning into the parking lot and was slamming her steering wheel upset that we weren't moving fast enough for her!  As we parked we looked over at where she parked I her car...in the motorcycle area and nor even in one parking space but 2 and was in a mood wouldn't even look over at us. I then found out when we were eating she is the Owner ...thinking here we're spending money pulling into her establishment and...rude! We will take our Busn elsewhere.
