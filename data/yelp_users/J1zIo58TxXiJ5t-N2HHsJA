This is hands down my favorite antique shop. I've been to most of the shops in phoenix and this one always stands out to me. I always seem to find something that I have to have wether it be some old black and white photos or a bear rug! The staff is friendly and will help you find what your looking for if you require something specific. They will also call the booth owner if you would like to make an offer on a piece. Everything is reasonably priced for the most part and the content stays filtered. I mean I have nothing against people who collect toys and beetles memorabilia but I'm just glad that at this store I don't have to sift through it.  2 thumbs up for sure!

I love this store! I have been to most of the antique shops in Phoenix and out of all of them this place is my favorite. The best thing about it is that it is somewhat regulated as to what is sold there. No plastic 80's/90's toys, no Britney Spears doll, no Bud light super bowl poster. This is the way antique stores should run, keep the junk in the junk drawer.

Let me just throw this out there right now. Being that this is my first review I just want to let you know that I do not intend to score easy on restaurants, this just happens to be a favorite of mine. So here it goes....  Ever have a day that just seems gloomy, depressing, boring, unfulfilled. Well, the common cure I have found isn't at the pharmacist or the doctor. No, the cure I found happened to be just around the corner at a little pizzeria called, well, pizzeria. This magnificent little joint is attached to the hip of what is known as La Grande Orange grocer. I have to say nothing brings a smile to my face faster than fresh shrimp ceviche followed by sweet corn pizza with sourdough crust and a pitcher of house made white sangria. My wife and I frequent this establishment and have never once left with bad taste. Service has always been exceptional even when the place is slammed with customers. I warn you though, eat all you want but do save room for a slice of peanut butter pie.  I believe the only thing that I've ever had problems with is some of the rude customers, but it's typical behavior of the residents of the area.

Wow this place took a turn for the worse... And to think that this used to be my favorite vintage shop. Everything that made Qcumberz has been thrown out the window and replaced with crafty junk and useless items. No more are the hidden treasures, unique finds and fun atmosphere. I used to feel like I was on a farm fresh pick guaranteed to find a irresistible piece that I had to have. Now it's more like meh... I would describe the new Qcumberz as an expensive garage sale that has a lot of home brew arts and crafts.... then I would quickly recommend somewhere else.

I'm giving Bertha's a 5 star rating simply because I have yet to find a better Turkey sandwich. Toasted bread, real turkey, avocado, thick crunchy bacon, and pickled onions...ooohhhhhhhhhh the pickled onions, the perfect hint of sweetness to finish off an epic sandwich. Everything always tastes fresh and light. It's fairly safe to say that they know what they're doing when it comes to tasty food. My favorites are the  Roasted Turkey Salami, Pesto, and Goat Cheese Thai Chicken Wrap  And for the mornings the Breakfast Wrap

Disappointment. That is what I have to say about the Discount Tire on 18th St. and Camelback. This store seems to be filled with a bunch of immature tire slingers. I thought you were suppose to be professionals and not mess around. Last time I checked there was no tire in the engine compartment and my trunk carpet wasn't creased in half from the factory. Discount, if you are going to have glass windows looking into your service bays make sure that your technicians... scratch that...shop boys show some respect for the customers cars and the parts that belong to them. That means please don't act like your going to have a tossing match with the wheels of the car because they're so light and small. Also I do have to say that for having 2 people on one car with 15 inch wheels and still take so long from park is kind of pathetic. At least no one was sleeping out there, I mean at least technically...  Will I go back to this location, probably not. I would much rather take it to the dealer, pay more and at least get a free car wash out of it.

I just did the photography for Yelp's "Little Yelp of Horrors" halloween party last night at 12 West Main. The event turned out great! I don't think it would have been quite as fun anywhere else. The Staff at 12 West Main are kind, friendly, and super easy to work with. Coming from a photographers prospective 12 West Main is a great location for weddings and all sorts of special events. It's industrial chic design leaves the doors open for so many different options. This place has great texture with red brick walls and beautiful industrial concrete floors. A versatile venue offering excellent catering, full service wet bars and more, 12 West Main is the Bee's Knees!

Ok so, I'm not a crazy dessert person, but I love food. However when approached with tasty treats only to find out that they were Vegan, lets just say I was a bit skeptical. I mean I'm not Vegan, I'm not going to pretend that I understand Vegans either, I like meat and stuff that taste good. This of course is all coming from the random thought that everything Vegan is yuck. Trying Treehouse was like getting slapped in the face as a kid, being told not to make fun of the ginger, because well.. he can't help it. In other words all of my misconception of Vegans eating this gross alien food went straight out of the window. I mean damn you people actually do have taste buds. I've actually come to the conclusion that I like Treehouse's vegan peanut butter cookies better than regular ones. Not to mention the non-cheesecake, this one was a mountain for me let me tell you. Thinking gross gross gross, how can you have no dairy in CHEESECAKE!? Well as my other eye opening taste-bud-tacular experience, the non-cheesecake hit a home run by the first bite, second, third.... damn it I ate the whole thing. Anywho you get my point. As a non Vegan, meat eating, cheese loving, son of a bitch, I fully recommend you try Treehouse bakery, because damn that shit is good!

First off let me say that I LOVE JJ's, that's why it's terrible that I would have to give this location a 2 star. There's nothing wrong with the sandwiches, they're pretty much on par with all of the other locations. My problem is with the staff and atmosphere. Every time I have been in to this location the music is BLARING. It's hard enough with the open ceilings, the sound effects of a busy kitchen, customer chatter, the last thing needed is a pre-recorded concert at max volume. Not only is the music high but often times inappropriate for a business environment. Not that I wouldn't listen to such music, it's just that I don't think the 7 yr old in front of me should have to listen to explicit content while waiting for food. This isn't the only thing that's wrong with this location. The attitudes of the staff sometimes make it seem like they're doing you a favor for being there. Even the manager seems to think it's a joke. Immature employees throwing food around like a fish toss makes you kinda wonder if your food has hit the ground at one time. There's a lot more, and honestly i'm not sure why I go back, when it comes to JJ's this location is trash. Maybe I'll have better luck with the local Firehouse subs when it opens up. Lame sauce.

I don't write too many reviews on here, mainly because I'm lazy... However I have to write a review for The Stand because I believe people should know how good it is. (And selfishly I want them to succeed so I can keep eating there.)  Starting with the design, clean, modern, minimalistic. The same approach was taken with the menu. Small, clean, and to the point.  Pricing - VERY reasonable for what you get.    Tacos - So far I tried the short rib and the chicken. The short rib packs plenty of flavor and is very well balanced. The chicken was good for sure, I just feel like the short rib is where it's at. (A+ short rib) (B+ chicken) I may be bias on this one...  Burgers - Cheese or no cheese. Fancy toppings optional. I tried "The Standard" with cheese. Clean, simple, no bull shit all American burger. Topped with their signature "the stand sauce" reminds me of a homemade in n out burger. Tasty to the max. (A)  Fries - Handcut, Real potatoes fried golden and tossed with sea salt. Clean flavor with no greasy after taste. (A+)  Milkshake - Damn they're tasty. In fact, I will go on record saying it's the best I've ever had. I've tried the Banana and the Dulce de leche, both amazing and hand made. Bonus points to The Stand as well for being awesome and supplying a proper big ass straw for a thick shake. If nothing else it's worth the trip and soon to be long wait just for the shake.   Summary - The Stand is not revolutionizing the world in how crazy they can get with their menu by putting over thought shit on there. Instead they took good food and made it better. I can say that after being to most of the burger spots in Arcadia and the Biltmore area that The Stand is one of the best.   P.S. - to anyone who may question this review I want to make it clear that I am in no way affiliated with The Stand either personally or through business. I just happen to think it's really good.
