First time eating here after reading the reviews of other yelpers. I must say that I was pretty impressed with the dishes that came out to us. They did not disappoint! We ordered the prime rib steak dinner, and some sushi platters. Every bit of taste, and texture was spot on right to the last bite. I will definitely be back!

Ordered their orange chicken based on another yelpers review. I wasn't impressed. The orange chicken that came out was not the same orange chicken that I have  grown accustomed  to. It was sad, in the way that it was over cooked, and way too much flour was used. After taking the first bite, i had hope to have sunken my teeth into what was supposed to be chicken, what i got was just flour. I decided to open a couple more of these "orange chicken balls" up to see if the first was just a fluke. Nope. To my surprise, they were all just like that. What I got was orange flour balls instead of the orange chicken that i had been craving for. I would of been happier going to tsing tsao or golden valley just a couple more blocks down the road.
