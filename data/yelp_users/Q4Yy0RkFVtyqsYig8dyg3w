this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. I have no idea how the food is because there are 2 steps and no ramp.

There are 3 choices at ASU for game design. Which one you choose depends on why you want to study game design.  1. Polytechnic = Games are an engineering problem. If you are interested in the engineering of games - go there. The college of technology and innovation http://interactive.asu.edu/?q=hom  2. Tempe = Games for (Education, Medical, Legal etc) They are closely tied with the education department and the Games for Impact initiative. http://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/  3. West = Games as Art (Fine Art) If you want to explore games as a medium and art form this is where you want to go. You can either get a BA -http://newcollege.asu.edu/harcs/degrees/majors/interdisciplinary-arts-and-performance-program or a BS http://newcollege.asu.edu/mns/degrees/computing/applied-computing-program

I just spent 5 days at Mayo Clinic Hospital  being treated for food poisoning (E. coli and Campylobacter)  after eating here.   I am profoundly disappointed. I thought the food tasted wonderful and the service was great  - but they cant get food safety right. do not eat here unless your next stop is the hospital.
