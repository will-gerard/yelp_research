OK I cannot speak for all their food, but their Adam RIchmond Big Unit hot dog was the best hot dog I have EVER had. It is really that good. 100% beef, goodness.   Great place for a beer  before heading to Chase field too.

It is what it is... cheap rates, but you get what you pay for. When our family was displaced from our house for a few days was perfect for us, kitchen, cheap rates, but the smell in the hallways is not the best. Nothing a little Fabreeze and scented candle couldnt mask.

You want a great neighborhood bar with a bunch of locals and some pool tables... this is as good as it gets.  Try the hot wings, they are good and the beer is cold as advertised.

Two great things to try here are the Mushroom/Bacon/Cheese burger and the Western Chicken sandwich--add bacon.  The Chicken sandwich is my favorite.

I have been back a few times since my first review. The first time I must have had a bad day or the cook did. The pepperoni pizza here is the best in Chandler. Staff is very nice and efficient.

Food was alright. Typical sports bar food. Beer selection on tap is a little weak. But what the atmosphere here is great. I think part of that reason was the bartender Megan. Delightful young lady who was friendly, always smiling and knew half the people there. I'll be back for sure to try some more food. Had the chicken and bacon Saturday special. Was ok. I'd order it again.

I live less than a mile from here and took over a year to get here.  Never realized what a hidden gem it was.  if you like country dive bars this is for you.  Food is not great, but it's good.  It's the atmosphere that makes this place a winner.

You wan customer service? They go above and beyond. We started getting my young daughter flute lessons here and had them inspect her used flute. The person who did their repairs was out sick and they had someone else do repairs that was filling in. During her next lesson the teacher was not happy with the repairs and we had them loom at it again. They apologized, gave us a free loaner and made a lot more repairs and did not charge us. Really happy with their service and will be a long term customer.

Was an amazing experience. I had reserved the table through OpenTable and mentioned in there it was my anniversary. The service we got was amazing. They even brought out a little anniversary gift/desert for us. Took our picture and gave it to us. Was a great experience. The food was good, the service was good. I dont know why it took me so long to get in here and eat, but it wont be this long before our next trip.

Great food, incredible cupcakes and the owners and staff are a delight to deal with. Easy to see why they are considered the best cupcake in Chandler.

Updating my 18 month old post. So yes they have the best cupcakes in Chandler for sure. Probably be best in the whole Phoenix metro area. They are that good.  My kids love their cupcakes for their birthdays.  But now you need to add their chicken salad sandwich. Knowing how good that is, it takes it from a 4 star to a 5 star. I am fan!

About time. I cannot tell you how long I have been looking for a dry cleaners that is cheap, fast and does a good job. Know how all drycleaners have a sign that says in by 9 out by 5.. but yet every single one of them says will three days from now be ok?  Not this place. I brought in some slacks at 6pm and they were ready for pickyp by 4 the next day.  This place is fantastic and the people behind the counter are so nice and friendly. Have been to dozens of dry cleaners, but this is the first one I really liked that has reasonable pricing in the area.

Latitude Eight is one of my favorite lunch locations in Downtown Chandler. I most often have had the Ginger Chicken Stirfry, but have had 3-4 different lunches and have never had anything I would not order again.  Latidude has a great atmosphere and the staff is always friendly

The staff was great, from the owner Bruce meeting you at the door to the bartender Sharon the friendliness of the staff stuck out.   I had the T.T. Burger which had cheddar, sauteed onions and remoulade. The burger was excellent, and the coleslaw was great. I am not a slaw fan, but this slaw with Bruce's mom recipe  that included vinaigrette was wonderful. My only complaint may have been the fries were slightly overcooked for my taste, but I would go there again.

If you are into technology, startups or just self employed looking for ideas and sharing ideas it doesn't get better than this.  Stop on in, connect to the wi-fi and start sharing your ideas with others. Make sure you stop by with lunch in hand for the Wednesday for their brown bag sessions. Always a great way to hear what others are doing in the community.

I do not use it as much as I used to, but am trying to get back there more often of late.   Love working out of Gangplank. A bunch of great people collaborating and new ideas.  Im a real estate agent, not a programmer, but still love hanging out there because of the community feeling they provide.

First check in on 4sq every time you come. Penny beer every 5th trip. It's all about the naked grilled  wings. I get mine hot. Not a fan of the breaded wings, but naked with no breading are fantastic. Also say hi to Eva behind the bar. She's great at what she does.

I am not a sushi fan at all, but a friend introduced me to the "I hate Sushi" menu which had a lot to offer.  Misty was our server, she was very polite and professional. I had the Hawaii Burger with Bacon and a side of steamed veggies instead of fries. Veggies were fantastic and the burger, cooked M, tasted fantastic. My only issue keeping it from being a 5 star review is for the price the burger was kind of small and the bacon was about as thin as the check paper was. But overall tasted excellent and I would go again.

Hows that for bad? Im the 4th person to review and the 4th 1-star review they got. The staff is not helpful and the managers are even worse. I even tried to get help from their corporate office, but they don't care either.   If you are going to buy something here make sure you check prices. Chances are you can save 50% by buying from an online vendor.   My issue was not price relate, my issue was with a return. The way I look at it they cost me $75, but in the long run it is going to cost them a lot more because when i buy my son his first dirt bike this summer it WILL NOT be from here. Love my Suzuki's, just despise my local Suzuki dealer.

Hot dogs are very good. I think outside of Alice Cooperstown this is the best hot dog in the Phoenix area.   Up for a challenge? Try their Dawgfather challenge which is 5.5lbs of food. Not into self inflicted pain? Then just get one of their hot dogs, they are very good 1/4lb dogs. If you can eat it in 30 minutes, it's on the house!

Stay away from these crooked bums. Why 1 star, because they wont allow 0. So I bring my car in for 2 $61 Tires, told it will be 170 then show up and my bill is $233?  "broken lug nuts" really.. i did the brakes about 1 month ago and they were fine then. They they tried to upsell me on all fluids including the tranny fluid which was done about 10k miles ago and the coolant which was done about the same time.  It gets better...  Driving home I hear a loud bang. nothing after that so keep going. I get home and as IM pulling into my neighborhood starts to overheat. I get out pop hood and the radiator cap is 1/2 off. That was my blow, the radiator cap was not put on correctly. They are lucky I didnt blow my engine and get a free engine out of them. STAY AWAY from the crooks that work here.

This may be my new favorite place to eat in Chandler. If you are looking for a very good meal, this is the place to take that someone special.  We went on a Friday night around 8pm and sat on the back patio. I started with the cheese tray, had some fantastic cheeses I had never had before.  Then I had a cup of the tomato soup. My biggest mistake, getting a cup and not a bowl. So rich and creamy. was fantastic.  For dinner I had the pork and my wife had the grouper. Both of us were very happy with our choices.   If there was one disappointment it was the chocolate tort we shared for desert. I would not order that again, but the rest of the meal was so fantastic that I almost forgot we even had desert.   Great service too. I could not be happier, will be back.

#aroundchandler So I finally made it here. So much hype about this place. Now I don't consider myself your average wing eater. I eat a serious amount of buffalo wings. I even made it to state championship for a wing eating contest. The wings here are good. The wings them self are average, but the sauces are way above average.  I always judge wings based on the standard hot. The hot was fairly hot, but very tasty. I also tried the ATL rub. The flavor was fantastic. I'm not a cool aid drinker, I stay away from sugar. But the fact they had cool aid I thought was pretty cool.  I will be a regular here and will try all 18 flavors of wings!!   #chandleraz

Been to almost all the local coffee shops and this is still my favorite. My new favorite thing here now is the 32oz iced loose leaf tea. Even better when they leave the bag in!  Orange / cinnamon is probably my favorite, but I like to mix it up. Many great flavors. The coffee here great too. The only thing I wish they had more of are outlets. The table on the back right as you walk in, over by the bathrooms area, has an outlet. That is the only table that has one right there.

Live the 7 pepper steak salad. Has a good kick to it. Tomato basil soup is good too but has to many croutons.  Great for lunch if you are looking for a good quick lunch and not to many people. Good for meetings because it is usually fairly queit at lunch time. Not sure why.. just is.

Downtown Chandler has been lacking a true coffee shop for a long time. Finally it is here. I had a 16oz Latte which was very good. I have a coffee shop in N Chandler and now I have one when I'm downtown. Welcome to Chandler Peixoto

My first time here so I can't speak for everything but I got the 1/2 salad/soup lunch. Chicken Caesar and Cheddar Ale. The salad was very good, but the soup was awesome!  Staff was super friendly.  They have amazing selection of craft soda. I don't drink soda, but for soda lovers you will like it. Will be back on AM to try coffee. Great atmosphere.

I have been back here a few times for coffee and to work out of here. Yesterday I had lunch again. Honestly, I raved about it my first time, but the second time may have been better. The Cheddar ale soup is still amazing. We can add on the tri tips sandwhich as something that is worth making the trip for. Also I am not a desert person, I eat it maybe 1 time a year. Tried the blondie brownie... O...M...G... I mean that. WOW. Yea... it's that good. Also I should add the staff there is amazing. They are all so nice, help you make decisions, give advice, make sure everything is ok.. just over the top great service.
