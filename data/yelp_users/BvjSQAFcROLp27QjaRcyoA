Ew. Each bite was pure fatty nastiness.

Pharmacist is SO FUNNY! He always brightens my day and brings comedic relief to a dull task (picking up prescriptions).   I don't do much of my grocery shopping at Albertson's since I try and purchase mostly sustainable foods, but their french bread is DELICIOUS! I could seriously eat a whole loaf in one sitting. The management is accommodating. I did once get hit on and stalked throughout the store by one of their creepy bag people. I think he might have been a little "out there" though, so it was more humorous than anything.

No bueno. I'm not a fan of chains to begin with, so when my fiance told me he wanted to spend his birthday here I was less than thrilled with his decision. I had made a reservation for a surprise party and our hostess was less than secretive when I brought my fiance through the door. She just pointed and said "Yeah, they're in there" -thus giving away with the fact that others were waiting for him. We were then greeted by our server. The first thing out of his mouth was "You guys splitting checks?" We were. He then told us "K. Make sure to not move around the table then. You'll make it confusing for me". I started to feel guilty about sitting in his section. Like we had done something wrong. Anytime we asked him for anything he replied with an annoyed look on his face and said "Yeah, give me a minute". Over and over. He left the table before getting everyone's drink order, forgot things, and we had to one person's food through the manager. In short, he sucked.   Shotty service aside, the food was AWFUL also. I ordered the Steak Cortez and every bite was pure fatty nastiness. Won't be going back.

For a fast food chain known for it's homogeneous franchise structure, there couldn't be much more inconsistency in the customer service.  I've been a long time fan of Subway and live close to this location.  Unfortunately, they have repeatedly let me down.  The most recent offense - the dreaded curly long black hair that had to be pulled out of my mouth.  Needless to say, this ruined my appetite.  But...these things happen and as long as the restaurant makes up for it, I will typically let it slide.  So, I called the location and told them about my sandwich with a little something extra.  They said they'd call me back after speaking with the store manager.  I received a call several minutes later and was informed that I could bring in what I had left of the sandwich and they would remake or refund me for however much is left.  I ordered a footlong and discovered the hair in the last quarter of the sandwich, which meant only a partial reimbursement for a miserable experience.  I was infuriated and swore at the poor girl on the phone.  She passed the buck to her manager and said that he'd give me a call to discuss this further.  Yeah right....how about I just let the YELP* world decide on this poorly managed Subway's fate?

LOVE Bison Witches. The bread bowls are where it's at. My only complaint is that I get bored with their menu. I wish they would do a special from time to time.

I was just at Bison Witches last night and discovered that they had added a monthly sandwich to their menu. I now must bump them up to five stars for following through. AND $1 Shiner Hefs Tuesday nights for ASU students. LEGIT!

:( I really wanted to like this place. I thoroughly enjoyed the farm, but I will review it separately. We were greeted by a busy waiter who quickly pointed to self-serve drinks (coffee, tea, water and lemonade) and ran off. We helped ourselves to some coffee and lemonade before we received our menus which stated that each drink was $2.75. I ordered the white truffled scrambled egg skillet (white truffles are my fave). I did not detect one bit of truffle essence in this dish. My fiance ordered the Cowboy Breakfast. It was like watered down chili with and egg on top. No great. The concept is great, but the way in which the food is prepared is super disappointing.

Dive bar? I guess, but the food, drinks, service and atmosphere are top notch. We ordered their BBQ Bacon Burger, Green Chile Mac & Cheese and Grilled Wings. All were DELICIOUS!!!! Bonus: they have shuffle board and Big Buck Hunter. This bar is legit. I plan on becoming a regular.

Daily Dose is hands down my favorite restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. I began going there when it first opened for brunch and was highly impressed by the multiple options they have available for the ways in which you can order Eggs Benedict. You can get them with roasted red pepper, asparagus, chorizo or my personal favorite...thinly sliced prime rib. In addition, they give you the option to order them "DD style" in which they replace the  english muffin and hollandaise sauce with a biscuit and gravy.   After enjoying their brunch on multiple occasions, I became curious about their happy hour. Not only do they have the most convenient happy hour schedule (4-8pm!) but their menu options are amazing as well. Unlike their morning hours during which there tends to be quite a wait time for a table, there is always availability during dinner time and the atmosphere is very comfortable. I don't think I have ever had anything from Daily Dose that was not to like.  Their sangria is delicious also :)   Some of my  favorite menu items:   Butternut Squash Ravioli   Prime Rib Eggs Benedict   Tacos (any)  Veggie Dip  Chicken Nachos (their salsa is great)   Panko Crusted Calamari  Cilantro, Jalapeno & Edamame Hummus  Chocolate Cake MMMmmm!

Singh Farms is absolutely MAGICAL!!! Ken Singh is a brilliant man with years of wisdom to share with the farms visitors. Their produce and other goods are of excellent quality and the prepared treats offered Saturday mornings are phenomenal! I will be back this coming weekend. My first visit was refreshing and an inspiration. Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful, Jason even drew me a map to find the restroom. They truly go above and beyond. The ambiance is very welcoming.

Review of nail services:   PROS:  I need to get gel nails done right before leaving on vacation and they were able to accommodate last minute.   The atmosphere is new + trendy.   The nail techs are very nice.   CONS:  I was misquoted on price and ended up paying more than 2x what I had planned on.   The pedicure "chairs" are the equivalent of sitting in a lawn chair against the wall. It looks nice but it's very uncomfortable. I prefer the big ones that give you a massage.   I was a bit rushed when picking out my color, but that may have been because I booked a last minute appointment.    I would go there again if I had no other options. I am curious about their tanning accommodations and hair services.

I just finished the wild mushroom ragu stack with truffle oil and I am STILL licking my lips in an attempt to savor the flavor.  Possibly one of the tastiest meals of my life... I sh*t you not.  My friend who I was dining with shook the table and I panicked and grabbed my plate in fear of losing the few bites I still hadn't finished.   My friend had the avocado salad with seared tuna which was tasty as well, but we both agreed the ragu was the bombdizzle.  Our server had a bit of trouble steering me in the right direction when I was indecisive about whether I should order the truffle mac and cheese or the ragu. I felt as though if he just asked a few inquisitive questions about what exactly I was looking for he could have offered me better advice. Nevertheless, I was highly impressed with my decision.   Despite our server's inability to offer solid menu advice, he was just as yummy as the food and greeted us with a genuine smile. If I was single girl I would have liked to ordered him for dessert. I will be going back tomorrow!

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!!   My friend and I went there last night. She warned that the service wasn't great, but the food was. We were seated outside and I ordered a glass of chardonnay (the one and only on their menu). It tasted awful so I waited for our server to come back around and asked to have it traded out for a beer. He told me he needed to ask his manager first since they were having issues with people trading drinks out. I waited. He returned to tell me there was nothing he could do, I had to keep my wine, and that it was "store policy" that they could not take back alcoholic beverages. I asked to speak to the manager. She came out with an overbearing, on guard demeanor and asked what she could do. I let her know I wanted to trade out my drink and she told me "yeaaaa, we can't do that. Store policy" with a "yeah, sucks to be you" tone to her voice. I told her it was a ridiculous policy and that she needed to do something to correct the situation. She carried on to argue with me. When I stood my ground and stated I wanted to speak with the owner she told me "don't take that tone with me" as if I was a child. Finally, she sent out the assistant GM and he seemed displeased with her unprofessional behavior. He asked that we stay but at this point I was so shaky I just wanted to leave. He gave me his card and asked me to come back. The only person he demonstrated professionalism in this situation was Shaun, the assistant GM. The company needs to come in and give their employees extensive customer service training.   p.s.  "Manager" Woman who gave me attitude: If you ever read this, grow up and go look in the mirror. Your attempt at applying fashionable make-up failed miserably.

Manager did provide me with a $25 credit to make up for the experience. The second time around, the service was much better. Food wasn't bad either.
