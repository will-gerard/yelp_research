Will never return. Worst manicure ever, chipped the next day. My manicurist kept shooting snot rockets and picking her nose in the sink between clients. None of my nails were the same shape. My friend with me got a French gel manicure and her girl took over an hour and a half to do them, and they started chipping the next day! Never going back.

After my MANY over hyped and over paid nail services over the years from LA to Hong Kong, Bronze Boutique BY FAR has done the absolute best nails I have ever had! I wouldn't trust my nails for a photo shoot or my next music video to anyone else. Not only is the staff beautiful and friendly, they are extremely well trained and knowledgeable :) I've been to places not nearly as decorated in a sexy chic enviroment, and paid twice as much! Bottom line, great prices, does a great job, and the pretty people that roam the store don't hurt! Go to Bronze Boutique if yoh know what's good for you Scottsdale!

Worst theatre ever. No wonder they are willing to only charge $5 for a ticket. I don't know if we got a "bad theatre" but my fianc√© and I sat in OFFICE CHAIRS, yes non reclining, wheeling, no arm rest OFFICE CHAIRS! Oh and our "tables" or shall I say "linoleum office cabinets". What the heck?!? Oh and get this! The lights to illuminate your food aren't really blue, THEY ARE WHITE WITH BLUE PAINTERS TAPE OVER THEM! Most ghetto theatre I have ever been sat in. I'll never go back and hope I get a good theatre.
