I first discovered these grease monkeys on Car Talk's website when I wanted to take my Toyota Highlander in for service at a place other than the Toyota dealership. Precision Imports had rave reviews on both Yelp and Car Talk's websites, so I figured I could trust them.  I have gone in twice and both times they were extremely professional, polite and have fixed my car issues quickly at a reasonable price. They are a little out of my way, but I'll happily drive the extra miles since I fully trust them to give my car the best care.  Here's one example from over a year ago. I took my car into a Toyota dealership for a 30,000 mile check up and they came back with a quote of about $4000 to fix issues with my car that I didn't think even existed, plus my car was running fine! I ignored the Toyota dealership's suggestions. A few months later I drove to Utah, did some off roading and my check engine light came on a day later. I took my car into Precision Imports and they discovered that it was simply some minor alignment issues and fixed it for $45! I asked about the issues Toyota mentioned and they said they didn't find anything like that. Let's see, Toyota told me my car problems about 25,000 miles ago and my car is just fine (FYI: I have over 180,000 miles on my car).  Example two from last week. I took my car into Walmart for an oil change and to check out a slow leak in one of my tires back in February.  They say they can't find anything wrong with my tire and suggest I get a new one. I put off buying a new tire and stick with just filling it up with air about once a week.  My check engine light goes on again. I took it in to Precision Imports for my next oil change and to see if they find anything wrong with my tire. Of course they do. They found a four inch nail in the tire, patched it up and the slow leak is gone. Oh, they plugged in something that Walmart probably left unplugged too. $72 for an oil change, patched tire and to check out and fix the check engine light situation.  I don't know much about cars, but these guys...these are good guys.

I have 231 reviews so far and none for one of my all time favorite AZ restaurants? I have to rectify that now. If you love wine and bruschetta than this will be your own version of Heaven. Blasphemy? Then you've never been to Postino! Seriously, they have the best bruschetta you're likely to ever have in your entire life. My top four:   1) Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone 2) Brie & Apples with Fig Spread 3) Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese 4) Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes  Also worthy of mention are the amazing sandwiches. I highly recommend the Autostrada (Sopresatta, Italian ham, cappicola, mortadella, provolone, arugula and tomatoes with spicy pepper relish) and the Nine Iron (Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise). Fucking awesome.  As you'll read in most of the other reviews, Postino has a great Monday and Tuesday night special, a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board for only $20. But be warned, it'll be jam packed. Keep in mind they have two other locations as well. For you east valley residents there is a new Gilbert loction. If you are in downtown Phoenix or west valley, then the Central Avenue location a couple blocks north of Camelback will be more convenient.  With its outstanding food, decor, and ambiance, I'm going to give you a Paul V. guarantee that you will love Postino.

Every time I have come to Aunt Chilada's I've had a great time along with some delicious Mexican food. I've tried their fajitas, enchiladas, quesadilla, torta, taquitos, and even the fired ice cream (don't typically get dessert at Mexican restaurants) and all have been very good. For what it's worth, I once went with a friend who doesn't like Mexican and she said Aunt Chilada's had one of the best burgers she's ever had. I can't vouch for that though. I recently tried the El Pollo Fundito and it was awesome. Probably about 2000 calories, but awesome.  This place is huge! Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor patio is my favorite on a beautiful spring evening. Great happy hour. A perfect place for group events. Live music on Friday nights. Trivia on Wednesday nights. Bocce Ball outside. Friendly staff each and every visit. Nice view of Piestewa Peak!  I really don't get some of the negative reviews of this place. Each of my dozen or so visits to Aunt Chilada's have been very positive and I will continue to return.

This restaurant is 5 stars for the view alone (which is what everyone else has mentioned), but the food and service are excellent too. The other night my girlfriend and I went back for the first time since the amazing Yelp event earlier in the year. We started the night off with a drink at sunset on the outdoor patio, overlooking most of Phoenix. Then we headed inside for our dinner and the manager greeted us with a "Thank you for coming back to Different Pointe of View," which I thought was a nice touch. I assume he knew we were returning since I mentioned we had a card for a free bottle of sparkling wine when I made the reservations weeks before.   We were seated inside near the window and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Our bottle of Champagne was presented to us to start the night and we placed our food orders. We decided to split the Braised Duck Ravioli ($12) and the Pan Seared Diver Scallops ($15). There were two raviolis and two scallops per order and we felt both dishes great choices. The scallops were some of the best I have ever had.   For our main course we each ordered the Grilled Cedar River Filet Mignon ($38). The perfectly prepared tenderloin steak was accompanied with horseradish crust, Swiss chard, roasted fingerling potatoes, smoked apple wood bacon, chives, Crème Fraiche and port wine pomegranate reduction. No I didn't memorize all of that, of course I retyped it from the menu.  For dessert we split the Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Crème Brulee (all desserts $9). It was delicious, but rather small and didn't quite satisfy my sweet tooth. The buttercream blue cheese cookie and fresh strawberries were a nice addition, but even with those it was too small a dish.   Overall, I 100% recommend you stop in and have dinner and drinks at Different Pointe of View. It has been one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants for many years. It's a perfect place for locals and out of town visitors alike. My only recommendations for improvements would be to add a server or two to the outside patio bar area since it tends to be slow on busy evenings. Also, I think the names for some of their dishes are a bit much and could be shortened.

Don't fall for the old quarter super glued to the floor trick!  They got me and had a good laugh.  Good service though.  I'd recommend.

This is my Quiktrip. I'm the Duke, the business photo is mine, and this is their first review, so I'm the boss. Come on in and enjoy some inexpensive gas, coffee, snacks, and 5 Hour Energy drinks! Quiktrips are the best convenience store/gas station in the valley.

The gas prices always seem reasonable and lower on average here and they sell 2 Five Hour Energy black labels for $6.  I like the two 1 liter water bottles for $2 too.  What else can I say about a 7-11.  I just wanted 1st review credits. HA!

If you're a Packers fan then this is the bar for you on football Sundays! If you are not a Packers fan it's still a great bar any day. When I found this bar/restaurant for my cheesehead girlfriend a couple years ago, we were both surprised to discover what a fun atmosphere and delicious food it provided.   Pretty much every dish I've tried has been great. The prices are good and they offer many drink and food specials throughout the week. My top recommendation is the cheesesteak (and I'm from the Philly area). It is the best I've had in the Phoenix metro area and I've tried a number of places. Also surprising was the Mexican food here is good too and one of the nights they offer them at half off.  It's in a shitty part of town, but I'd say it is worth a visit if you are within a few miles.

The thin crust pizza with pepperoni, sausage and garlic is one of my favorite pies in all of Phoenix.  So good and so addicting!  I pretty much stick with that when eating at Fatso's.  I tried their wings and the Big Johnson specialty pizza.  Wasn't really a fan of either, but I'm telling you, you won't go wrong with a thin crust with pepperoni, sausage, and garlic pizza.  It's INSAAAAAAAAAAAANELY good!!!  Dip the sucker in some ranch, and you got yourself a deliciously, decadent and gluttonous meal. Damn, that's some good $#*%!

Very cool dive bar serving up some great burgers! I finally made it to the Original Wineburger after living in Phoenix for six years and I'm glad I did! Last night I ordered the burger and fries combo. I added on cheese, bacon, onions, ketchup, and mayo. The burger came out about five minutes later and was presented to me in all of its cheesy and greasy glory. I was immediately impressed and I can see myself returning soon. Next time I will add a fried egg to my burger. I dig any burger place that offers that option.  Sylvia was my friendly server behind the bar and informed me that Wineburger has been open since 1965 and are not affiliated with any other Wineburgers. I'm curious to find out the story about why that is. She also informed me that they have live open mic music on Wednesday nights. It may not make #1 on my list of best burgers in the Phoenix metro area, but it is up there and I definitely recommend The Original Wineburger.

Lenny is the man and his burgers are some of the best you'll find in the Valley! I first met Lenny and his family at the Burger Battle a couple months ago. After experiencing how great their burgers tasted and how nice the family was, my girlfriend and I decided we'll have to check out one of the actual restaurants in Phoenix. I am glad we did because it reminded me why we gave Lenny's Burger our vote for best at the Burger Battle!   My girlfriend and I both ordered the Ranch Bacon Cheeseburger and it was out of this world! Lenny came by to check and see how everything was and we informed him that everything was just as delicious as we remembered it from the contest. It was nice to get to talk to him about Lenny's Burger history in Phoenix too. The fries are awesome and I recommend trying one of their six dipping sauces. Everything is reasonably priced, the seating area is nicely designed and clean, and service was great! I'll definitely come back to Lenny's to satisfy my frequent burger cravings.

One of the best Spring Training sites, second only to Salt River Fields in my opinion. Scottsdale Stadium is home to the SF Giants and is the best location of all the stadiums. It has a great seating and lawn area. Post game day drinking is always in order when at this Old Town ball field. Food is good, great people watching, and oh yeah, the baseball games! Does it get any better than Scottsdale in March? I submit that it does not!   I'll have to be honest though, ever since Salt River Fields opened up in 2011, I haven't been to Scottsdale Stadium. Maybe it's just because it is closer, but I am digging on the vibe at SRF more these days. Still, you won't go wrong with picking a game at Scottsdale Stadium. Another added bonus about this place, they have the Fall League games here as well. Good place to see up and coming stars.

This Festival will get its fair share of hateful reviews, but you know what? I like it. Not an "I Like It and I Want To Go Every Year" kind of like, but more of an "I Like It and Would Go Every Other Year" kind of like. It is great for people watching so you really don't have to spend a ton of money to have a good time. It's $10 to get in and if you don't get wasted or pig out then you can get by with spending only $20 inside. Yes, almost all of the vendors are over priced and the food can be rather pedestrian (too many chain restaurants for my liking), but you can find a few tent gems that are offering good food at a reasonable price. Yesterday I got a big $6 BBQ plate, $2 for two tacos, a big order of stromboli for $5, $2 mac n' cheese, and a $6 16oz. Coors Light.  Don't worry, I spread that out over about 6 hours (with a midday break at Patties for a few beers).  One big improvement this year is doing away with the tickets and switching over to a debit card for all of your food and drink purchases. Much easier. One bummer, it is the same tents year after year. It makes it kinda boring.  Tips on making it better: Why not have a section for new restaurants at the Culinary Festival? Like a whole stretch of tents for all the first time restaurants appearing at the GAP. I don't know, I think this is a great idea if I may say so. And I know this sounds lame, but some of the prices at these tents are ridiculously high. Why set your prices so high at an event like this when you can possibly attract new customers to your actual restaurant. Seems like a bad business decision to me.    It will always crack me up when I see girls dressed in club attire and six inch high heels for this event. Why?!? You are walking around a food festival and there is no way you are comfortable in that shit! Hysterical. Please don't change, Scottsdale!

This is THE best place for late night eats in the Old Town area of Scottsdale. Forget that phony cheesesteak place up the road. Joe's is where it's at! They are a true NY style thin crust pizza. Very delicious and many options for slices late at night as the bars are letting out. The lady that runs the place during those late night hours isn't the friendliest, but I wouldn't be either when I'm trying to get drunk assholes in and out as quickly as possible. Great pizza, good scene, great...pizza.

Besides the original location in Brooklyn, this is the Grimaldi's location that started the love affair for me.  I'll never forget driving down Scottsdale Road in May 2006, days after I moved into town from Washington, DC and I saw the Grimaldi's sign.  I thought, "Could it be?  Could Grimaldi's from Brooklyn actually have opened up a new location?!?"  Sure enough, I learned that they sold the recipe to a company that is opening up franchises (something like that) of the pizzeria.  I was thrilled!  Tasted it and was even more thrilled to see it tasted so similar to the Brooklyn location.    I have been to four locations around the Valley and each one makes excellent thin crust coal burning oven pizza.  Totally top notch!  Best pizza in AZ hands down!    My favorite Grimaldi's pizza: Large with pepperoni, sausage, and basil (baked in).  Can't go wrong.  Also, their "small" salads are big enough to share.

This is no ordinary Denny's!  Whether it's the stereotypical drunk Scottsdale douches fighting in the restaurant or wasted skanks having diarrhea in the parking lot, this Denny's is guaranteed to entertain. I've witnessed some crazy and disturbing shit (literally) at this place while enjoying a Denny's Bacon Slam Burger and chocolate shake at 2am after a night out at the the Dogg or Ernie's. I'll only eat at this Denny's.  All other Denny's simply aren't worth it!

Without a doubt the best dentist I have ever been to.  I have been going to Dr Lachot since 2006 and I will never change my dentist.  First off, the dental assistants are great and always do a wonderful job cleaning my teeth.  They are friendly, professional, thorough and gental while cleaning.  The office itself is very beautiful and clean.  The walls and ceilings are painted beautifully.  They also offer a headset to listen to the TV they have in front of each chair while they work on your teeth if you are uncomfortable.  I actually look forward to my dentist visits here.  The technology they have for checking and cleaning your teeth is as modern and high tech as it gets.    Lastly, Dr Lachot is great.  Excellent at what he does and I can easily give him five stars for the work he and his staff do.  If your insurance covers their services you definitely should go there too!

I finally made it to The Chuck Box and I am very glad I did! Like other reviewers stated, the ordering/paying system is screwed up, but ultimately, I'm here for a delicious burger and fries! Make that a Double Big Burger with bacon and American cheese. It took a little while, but good things come to those who wait. And man, was it good. I'm ranking it at either second or third in my Best Burgers of Phoenix list. The Chuck Box grills their burgers over an open flame, giving it a great flavor.  I get people's issue with a fixin's bar, but when I was there it was in decent shape. I'm willing to forgo my slight germaphobia in order to get whatever I want, the way I want it, on my burger. Also, the midwesterner inside me loves the fact that they offer free ranch dressing for all your French fry dipping pleasure. (Please note: I'm not at all from the midwest)  I went with a friend after a day trip to Sedona for some hiking. We both heard great things and wanted to give it a try. After an impromptu decision to head directly to Chuck Box, we made a second impromptu decision to make it a Tempe burger tour and give Lobby's a try as well. Both were great, but I'm giving the nod to Chuck Box, while my friend voted for Lobby's.

What a pleasant surprise this hotel turned out to be! I'm anti-downtown Vegas and the only reason I went was for the Yelp event that night. I booked a room at this hotel since there was a special offer for Yelpers. Let me jump ahead a minute and say that our room exceeded expectations since it was spotless and recently remodeled. It seemed like we were the first ones to stay in this room it was so new and clean! That being said, the guy from that show Hotel Impossible would have a field day with the employees at the Fremont Hotel & Casino.  Upon arrival, our valet tells us he wishes he wasn't working today. Is that the kinda guy I wanna give my car to? Then there was the check in girl. She was pretty clueless and unable to answer a number of our questions. The bellhop was a little better, but also had an I-Wish-I-Wasn't-Here type of attitude.  Other than that, my time with the employees at this hotel was very limited and the four star rating is mainly for the very clean and modern room. I would recommend this hotel if stuck in the Fremont area.

Not much to say about this place that hasn't been said already from the looks of the hundreds of reviews.  I've tried all of their pizzas except the Marinara and Rosa.  All have been excellent, but wasn't such a fan of the Wiseguy.  Too much onion for me, but the fennel sausage is great.  The Biancoverde and the margherita with fennel sausage are my favorites.  Next time I'll be trying the Rosa for sure.  Some tips:  So of course you hear about the crazy long waits.  Make the most of your time if you have a three hour wait.  Go check out the Science Center's Body Worlds while you wait.  I think it's about $20 to get in, but it really is cool and kills a couple hours.  Then make your way back to Bar Bianco.  Get a bottle of wine and one of their appetizers (cheese dish is good, but small).  By the time you finish the bottle it's time to eat.  Also, I highly recommend going in the fall or spring on a really nice night so you can sit outside with your wine.  Enjoy!

I haven't been to the MGM since 2003 and after my recent trip to Vegas I can guarantee you it won't be another 9 years before I am back! I was so impressed with this hotel from check in to check out. I arrived at 10:30am on Saturday and was surprised to see our room was available for us even at that hour. We were told we would have a recently remodeled room too. Upon entering the room we inspected it for cleanliness and it was spotless.  We then headed down to the Grand Pool for the afternoon and had a great time. We were again impressed with the fact that we were allowed to bring in our own beer to the pool provided we use their cups. No problem. There were many pools and all were clean and offered a different vibe. Just so you know, don't expect the "lazy river" to be a lazy river you've probably experienced elsewhere. There are hardly any inner tubes in the river and it is entirely 20 somethings partying it up. I was hoping for a relaxing trip down the lazy river, but it was still very fun.   Thank you MGM Grand for a great experience and for treating us Yelpers so well! I will return for sure.

Absolutely love these burgers. Maybe my favorite burger of all time.  The first time I went I had the regular burger.  It was good, but wasn't blown away.  Then...I tried the Delux Burger.  Wow.  I'm talkin', "Holy Shit Wow!"  It's that good.  (Ok, so I used that expression in a previous review, but it applies here as well)   The meat is so fresh and so good.  The bun is great. The baby arugla is a nice touch, making it stand out from all other burgers.  Here's how the menu describes their burger...  "fresh ground, all natural, grain fed certified premium beef, maytag bleu cheese and gruyere cheese blend, caramelized onion with applewood smoked bacon mixture and baby arugula served on a hand crafted toasted demi-baguette. [lettuce wrap available]"  They recommend the burger prepared medium-rare and I agree.  Gotta try the fries with the aioli sauce.  I suggest dipping the burger in the aioli too!  I am starting to crave one now just writing this.

One of the best, if not the best pizza in all of Phoenix in my opinion.  It is very similar to the more famous Bianco style of pizza, however way less of  a wait.  Every pizza I've had from Cibo is excellent.  The decor and atmosphere is fantastic and perfect for a romantic date.    They have a great outdoor area and on a nice night when the weather is right, you can't ask for a more perfect/romantic setting.    Just so you know, if you are in the mood for some pizza for lunch, this isn't your place.  Pizza is only served at dinner and I think it's only sandwiches and salads for lunch.  I recommend it all though!

Had a New Years Eve dinner with my girlfriend last night and we had an excellent dinner. Started off with the lobster/crab cake and it was very delicious, definitely would get again.  For the main course I had the Filet Mignon which was delicious as well, but not the best steak I have ever had.  Our side dishes were the mac and cheese (phenomenal!), creamed spinach (excellent!), and potatoes au gratin (Sensational!)  After the meal we were so full we skipped dessert.  The decor is nice inside.  A little stuffy, but nice.  We had an 8:30pm reservation and when they called to confirm the registration they said it was 8pm (I know for sure it was set for 8:30pm).  The caller seemed a little surprised/annoyed to hear of the mistake, but stated she would make sure it worked at 8:30pm.  When we arrived at 8:30pm they had us wait until about 8:45pm.  Not really a big deal though.  Overall, I definitely recommend The Capital Grille!

Everyone loves LGO. Well, almost everyone. I see a few one and two star nuts in the mix.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix too, but I have to say, the pizza is more like 3 stars. It is good, but not great. Just not a big fan of their crust. Now, the burgers, decor, service and people watching are all awesome. Plus it is attached to the LGO grocery store which is great.  Last night I had their green chili burger for the first time and thought it was great. The beef was delicious and cooked to order, the roasted green chili tasted great, and even though it is borderline sacrilege, when at LGO, you gotta go with one of their massive English Muffins instead of a bun. I think it could be even better with melted American cheese, but the shredded cheddar is a nice alternative to the slice. The side of fries were awesome and they give you more than enough.  After dinner I suggest you go over to the grocery store area and try one of the delectable desserts. I'm a fan of the Tammie Coe Ooey Gooey cupcakes myself. Parking's a bitch, but you can understand why. It's a great place. Check 'em out. You'll probably like it a lot.

From what I can tell, I don't think Dick's wants your business. With no sign out front and as hard as it is to find, you have to be in the know to give the aptly titled Hideaway a try.  But search for it you must, for it is truly one of the best breakfasts I have ever had the pleasure of consuming!   I'm a huge fan of Mexican style breakfasts and the Huevos Rancheros are insane! Two eggs any style, served on a blue corn tortilla, smothered with green or red chile and cheese, served with potatoes and beans and it is enough for two people.  Just look at the pictures posted by the other Yelpers people.  You can tell just by looking at the photos that this place is going to be awesome.  Just go in and give this place a try already (if you can find it!).  How many more five star reviews do you need?!?

What a great place! Awesome food, drinks, patrons, and owners! One of the friendliest bars in Phoenix. Everything I've ordered from their menu has been excellent!   The Red Onion Lounge is a Packer bar and my girlfriend is a Wisconsin girl, so we started going here for the Packers games this past season. Have some great memories here in 2011 with the highlight being a Super Bowl victory!  This place is known for their Green Chili Bacon Cheeseburger.  Just got back from having one and I can see why.  Wow, that was a tasty burger.  Definitely one of the best burgers you'll find in Phoenix! Also great are their BLTs, Cheese Curds, Pulled Pork Sandwich, fries and the home made potato chips.  Looking forward to going back again to try more of the food.    The Red Onion also has three pool tables, dart boards, juke box, and karaoke Thursday through Sunday.  The owners, Mystic and RJ, are really friendly cool people.  Stop in, grab a drink, a green chili bacon burger, play some pool, sing a song, have a great time!

One of the only Chinese places I like in the valley. I always go with the #12 lunch combo, the chicken and broccoli. It is delicious and the spring rolls are great too. I highly recommend Siu Wok if you're looking for a Chinese fix during lunch.

A really great thrift store that sells some excellent stuff. Plus, Flo's on 7th is Florence Crittenton's store, so it's helping out a great cause.  Check this place out first before any other thrift store.  You can find better stuff here and at a good price.

Say what you will about this place, but overall, I dig it. I didn't appreciate it when I lived in Scottsdale, but as I have moved farther and farther away, I find myself wanting to go here more and more. There are many good restaurants, nightclubs, bars, hotels, stores, activities, and people watching. I guess it isn't for everyone since a lot of people talk shit and hate this place. I get it rest-of-Phoenix-metro-area, you don't like the people. WHAAAAAH! Shut up.  It's better in Scottsdale than most of the valley. Here are my top choices in Old Town in no particular order:  -Mastro's City Hall -The Lodge -Daily Dose -Civic Center -Scottsdale Stadium -Joe's NY Pizza -The Casablanca Lounge -Grimaldi's Pizza -Rusty Spur -AZ 88 -W -Fashion Square Mall -Culinary Dropout  I could list more, but you have Yelp at your disposal.  Use it! :-)

Peoria Sports Complex is home to the SD Padres and the Seattle Mariners. It is a very nice stadium in Arizona's collection of Spring Training venues. Nice layout, good area of town, and with lawn tickets at only $6 it's a deal that is hard to beat. Like most of the other stadiums, the parking is $5 and it is fairly easy to get into and park. I deduct a star because the lawn area in left field isn't too great since there isn't enough slope and can make it hard to see over the fence and other people's heads, plus there is a lack of shaded seats in the stands. Other than that, this is a Spring Training facility I definitely recommend. It is worth the trip from anywhere in the valley.  Tip: Not positive, but you may be able to park across the street in the huge shopping area with all of the restaurants.

Upon arriving at Phoenix Municipal Stadium I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this facility. It was easy to get to from the 202, easy parking ($5), and a nice view of the Papago Rocks over the left field wall. The one disappointment was there isn't any lawn seating.   Home to the Oakland A's, Phoenix Municipal Stadium will give you a chance to see Manny try and make a return to baseball before the rest of the country does during the regular season. Not a bad draw.

I'm sorry, but these four and five star reviews are a bit much for this place.  The cookies are good, but nothing earth shattering.  Plus, when you are charging almost $2 (ridiculous!) a cookie...they better be the best I've had, and they just aren't.    If Paradise Bakery charges almost $1.50 per cookie then I'd say these cookies should have a street value of about $1.  Sorry, but I'll take a Paradise Bakery Cookie over an Urban cookie any day.

Circle K? More like Circle Z. This place is essentially Zombieland so watch out for zombies approaching you while you pump gas. Seriously, I hate stopping at this place. Inconvenient set up for accessing gas pumps, plus the aforementioned zombies makes this place a no go.

I used to be anti-Cold Stone, but I've changed my stance since moving nearby and getting it way too often due to my girlfriend's cravings. Yeah, that's it, I'll blame her for our weekly visits. We started going to this location about a year ago and the trend always seemed to be pissed off, teenage high school girls with neck tattoos behind the counter hatefully making your ice cream. It was especially nice when they felt the need to complain about their miserable lives to the customers. But ya know, I learned something from one of them one day. It sounds to me it was the owner or manager of this location that was the bane of these poor girls' existence. So ya know what, I'm on their side now.   But that used to be the trend. Over the past few months there seems to be a happier group of girls working who don't have neck tattoos. They are more upbeat, positive, and don't complain. They make damn good Gotta Have It sized specialty ice cream bowls. Enjoy!

I don't see the need to ever go to this place unless you are flying in or out of the Deer Valley Airport and you just got off the longest flight in the history of flights and there was no food on board.  The buffet is just kinda gross.  They advertise a fish fry on Wednesdays and Fridays, but I don't see how they feel confident standing by their advertised fish fry.  It's just kinda gross.  The fried cod was too breaded and the fish didn't seem fresh or prepared right.  The lasagna was good, but not worth revisiting this place for.  I also sampled the shrimp cocktail (which was ok, but may have given me the shits), fried shrimp (bleh), fried chicken (ok), their soups (weren't very good), chocolate cake (crappy and stale tasting), rice pudding (barely ok),  and the table bread was fresh and nice (so stock up on that shit).  Oh, and not a fan of their salad bar either really.  Sorry Deer Valley Airport restaurant (although really I think you should be apologizing to me), but I'll never be coming back.

I'm writing this review mainly for the McDonald's inside (since it's a given any Walmart is one star).   This is easily the worst run McDonald's I have ever had the displeasure of going to. Whether it's stale over cooked food or making you wait an eternity to get your food, it sucks every time without fail.  This location is the closest to my home, so once in a while I get sucked in to try one of the Extra Value Meals.  They have gotten me for the last time. I refuse to eat here ever again.  Eh, I'll be better off anyway.  Also, Walmart's produce is the worst since it is awful organic produce.  Waste of money for an inferior product.

I've switched to Shane's as my local BBQ place after eating there couple times.  Their Smothered Pork sandwich is a definite must have.  It is slow-smoked, hand-chopped pork with Shane's secret sauce, piled high on a bun and topped off with their creamy coleslaw.  I always go to BBQ places thinking I will need a lot of extra BBQ sauce, but with this sandwich you really don't.  Very flavorful and very huge.    I recently went in with a coupon for a buy one sandwich get one free (with a purchase of a drink too) and I got two of the Smothered Pork sandwiches.  Had one for dinner, put the other one in a ziplock bag in the fridge.  It was perfect the next day for lunch and I didn't have to even reheat it.  Great deal, great food, I'll be back.

This place is a chain, so I'll keep this brief.  The burgers are just ok.  Nothing special and definitely don't come anywhere near my Best Burgers of Phoeinx list.    I had the Royal Burger or whatever it is called.  Look, it's the one with the egg on it ok?  Anyway, the egg is way too done.  I'd prefer over easy or medium at the most, but this sucker was way over hard.  Not a fan so I 86ed the thing.  Way too much mayo on it too.  The fries are decent, mozarella sticks too.  Nothing amazing here.  I did enjoy the chocolate shake though.  The two times I have been to this location the service has been pretty poor.  Nothing I'm in the mood to get into right now, but the hostess was lame and the waitress subpar.  Funny tip: when they ask if you've been to a Red Robin before.  Say no.  They all over react like it's the craziest thing that you've never been to a Red Robin before.  I don't see the big deal if you haven't and their reaction is annoying, but now that you know what they'll do it is fun to mess with them and see how they over react.  Want great burgers?  See my list of Phoenix's best burgers. Try one of those places and you won't be disappointed.

Ray's is the closest pizza place from my new home in north Phoenix and I dig it.  Their style of pizza reminds me of my neighborhood pizza place where I grew up in New Jersey.  I usually just go with a plain cheese pizza at Ray's and add on the spices, like black and red pepper, oregano, and garlic.  I usually go in for the two slices and a soda lunch special.  Ray's Pizza: It's cheesy, it's greasy, it's delicious.  Give it a try!

I am proud to give Dr Jones and the staff at Digestive Health Specialists their first Yelp review. I just can't believe they haven't had any other reviews yet. This office was FIVE STARS all the way! The front desk staff, the nurses, and Dr. Jones all made me feel at ease, answered all of my questions, were very understanding, and I couldn't be more pleased. I went in for a flexible sigmoidoscopy and a colonoscopy. Dr. Jones and the staff were a consummate professionals on each visit. I appreciated the preparation and post procedure phone calls. When I need another colonoscopy in five years I will be sure to come back to this office and I recommend you do the same!

If the Monaco Focaccia was a woman I'd leave my girlfriend, marry the Monaco and produce baby Monacos.  Best sports bar food in town.

This is by far the best sports bar food I've ever had.  Here's what I highly recommend:   -Cheeseburgers: however you want it, they are excellent. -The Monaco: one of the most popular items on the menu (just know though, these can be inconsistent.  Sometimes you get an amazing one, sometimes it is poor). -Golden Chicken Wings: They have the best wings in town I think and if you ask for them "golden" they are even better. -Chicken Strips tossed in wing sauce -Cookie Skillet for dessert.  Not the best I've ever had (Oragano's has a better one), but it is good and huge!  It's about twice the size of Oregano's. Great atmosphere and great place to get together with friends to watch the game.  The happy hour and reverse happy hour specials are very good for both food and drinks.  Here's another tip:  when they ask if you want fries or onion rings as a side, you can also do a 50/50 split.  Both the fries and onion rings are worth trying.

Know what sucks about this place?  As you sit here having a late night snack before stumbling back to your hotel room, you realize that there are about 10,000 better places in Vegas that you could be.    You came to Vegas for this?  Seriously?  Get the fuck outta here and hit the clubs!

This is the perfect place for a "staycation." Ugh, I hate that I just used that term, but it is the correct one to use.  Firesky is a beautiful resort, nice pool, service, rooms, and all.  Very nice firepits and free wine, beer and other drinks during happy hour.  I live in Phoenix, so it was a nice weekend away while still being near home. If I'm coming from out of town though I may want to stay somewhere a little more modern and swanky.  It's less than a $5 cab ride from Old Town Scottsdale, so in other words it's free. Are you a teacher? If so, check out their teacher discount offers. Pretty sweet deal.

Just moved to this neighborhood and Times Square Pizzeria is my favorite restaurant in the area so far.  My girlfriend and I went there the other night for dinner and we split a margherita pizza and the Pasta Giovanni (ordered it with angel hair instead of the penne).  We were very impressed with both dishes!  Two night later, I find myself getting some Pasta Giovanni as a to go order.  We also went here for breakfast about a month ago for our first visit.  Great breakfasts at a great price!    Based on the amazing aroma of this place when walking in you can tell it is going to be good food.  I highly recommend Times Square Neighborhood Italian Restaurant.  I'm sure to be back again and again.

I still prefer Zipps for the food, but Half Moon has very good bar food too. Burgers and wings are great (again, Zipps are better).   Half Moon is way better for watching a game though. Way better seating arrangement.   Go when it isn't busy and you can have one of the side rooms all to yourself, rearrange the furniture however you want and get the remote so you can put on whatever. I shouldn't be sharing this.  Nice outdoor seating with a fire pit for all you smokers.

If I'm driving through DeForest you can be sure to find me at Ehlenbach's! Sure it is a touristy cheese castle and you can probably get great cheese curds at a local grocery store in Anytown, Wisconsin, but I'm not from these parts and I love the cheese! I love their garlic and herb, cheddar, and marbled curds. Whenever I'm running low on cheese merchandise like hats made of cheese, cheese magnets, cheese souvenirs I know where I can stock up! They ship to anywhere in the country. They have a very photogenic store front too! After a long day of waterslides at Wisconsin Dells, make the drive back to Milwaukee a little better by stopping at Ehlenbach's Cheese Chalet!

The 51 is my favorite highway in Phoenix simply for the scenic views and convenience. The drive through the Phoenix Mountain Preserves is a nice change from the boring highway driving in this city. If you can, I'd avoid this highway Mon-Fri between 7am-8am (southbound) and 4:30pm-5:30pm (northbound). Those seem to be the worst times. Also, avoid the exit for the 101 west during the evening rush hour. It's a nightmare. My one and only goal in life is to be the Duke of the 51 Freeway.   PS-If you litter the highways or anywhere in AZ, I'll turn your ass in. Don't Trash AZ: 877-354-8837

Well, I don't think I'm "super cool" for liking this place, but I guess I am "totally down with the hole in the wall places in the hood." Just playing Samantha O. :)  Really though, I think Los Reyes de la Torta is fantastic! I went last week for the first time in about a year and I forgot how good it is. All I've had so far is the Torta Nortena (with the steak, not chicken) and the steak tacos. Both were incredible, especially the Torta Nortena, which has grilled steak, onion, jalapenos, melted cheese, chipotle, tomato, avocado, and chipotle mayo. It's huge and it's fucking awesome.   I haven't had a burrito here yet, but after seeing what the patrons at the next table had, it's on my to-do list. The burritos were about the size of my forearm and looked delicious. Los Reyes de la Torta may be famous for their King Torta seen on Man Vs Food, but to be honest I'd never get that one. It has way too many kinds of meat and it's total overkill. But hey that's me, maybe you'll like it. Eat this sandwich in under 15 minutes and it's free.  In case this video hasn't been posted already, check out the 2 minute clip of Man Vs Food at Los Reyes de la Torta here:  http://www.travelchannel.com/video/a-sandwich-fit-for-a-king-11276

"After a long battle with the desert, this ancient building still commands respect." That's the first line from the Casa Grande Ruins pamphlet and it pretty much nails it right on the head. This place is an excellent day trip from Phoenix and I'd consider it a must do if in the area. The ruins are four stories high, 60 feet long, and the circular holes in the walls align with the setting sun. The Hohokam knew the changing positions of celestial objects and that helped with planting and harvesting. Pretty sophisticated stuff for a culture that started about 2000 years ago. Or maybe it's not that sophisticated, I don't know. Either way, check out this National Monument. No hiking there, but it's very educational and if you are fascinated by ancient ruins you will love it.

Mastro's hardly needs another review since most people know this restaurant is five stars all the way. Last night my girlfriend and I spent our three year anniversary at the City Hall location. We sat in the bustling bar area with the band playing nearby. It was the perfect location for people watching and not too close to the band so we could hear each other.  I usually go to Mastro's Ocean Club about once a year and this was my first time to the City Hall location and I think I like this one better now.   We started with the calamari as an appetizer. It was deliciously breaded and came with an excellent dipping sauce. For the main course we shared the Chilean Sea Bass and a 12oz Filet Mignon. The Sea Bass melts in your mouth and the filet was cooked to medium rare perfection. Our side dishes were creamed spinach, gorgonzola macaroni and cheese, and scalloped potatoes. Each were phenomenal. Nothing wrong with this meal. Our $51 bottle of Charles Krup Cabernet was a great choice to accompany our meal. It reminded me of an even better J. Lohr.  I forgot I mentioned that we were celebrating an anniversary to the hostess when making the reservation about a month before. So when we were greeted with a chocolate cake at the end of our meal it was a very nice surprise. It was delicious and a perfect way to end an outstanding night. (check out the pic I posted)  For a more relaxed atmosphere, sit in the dinning room area. For a more fun and active nightlife type of scene, I recommend sitting in the bar area. There is also nice outdoor seating by a fireplace.

So I've gone here a few times in the past, but after my last experience...NEVER AGAIN!  What a jerk the owner is!  Since I would go in once in a while for the haddock and chips I figured I'd get their restaurants.com coupon where it is $10 off.  I go in with my girlfriend and show the coupon.  Immediately there is a problem.  I have used restaurant.com coupons dozens of times and there has never been an issue.  The manager talks to me and explains they don't allow the coupn on any items on the specials list and a bunch of other things they won't accept it on, limiting my selection to about three items.  None of which I like/want.  It doesn't say anything on the coupon about this and then the owner (the British dude) comes over and angrily expresses that they never wanted to be on that site and they are not honoring the coupon anymore.  I made the point in a calm manner that I've been a loyal customer and he says he doesn't care and won't accept the coupon.  Why not?  It is out there.  I purchased it.  Nothing on there says it is limited to certain items.  $10 is $10.  If he accepted it I would have spent plenty of money on that visit, plus future visits.  Never again will I give them my money.  I don't support jerks whose food is just average at best anyway.  Might be the only place to get haddock, but it isn't worth it.  PS-It isn't the only place to get Haddock in Phoenix.  Wanna know where?  Message me and I'll tell you.

Had a table for three at Brand on Saturday night during Yelp's Spring Break weekend and enjoyed an excellent meal and overall experience. We started off the evening at their lounge and enjoyed two for one drinks. The bartender was friendly and the atmosphere was just right. We were seated at our table by the casino floor which was the best seat in the house for people watching. Our waitress, Alexan, was friendly, attentive, and professional throughout our meal. I definitely recommend getting a table in her section.  We started off with some appetizers to split. We all enjoyed the wedge salad, tuna tartare, and a Hot Rocks (a large hot rock to prepare some thinly sliced sirloin at your table). All apps were awesome and I recommend each.  For our main course, my friend and I ordered the 12oz bone-in filet mignon, while my girlfriend had the Chilean Sea Bass. The filet was fantastic and prepared to medium rare perfection! I sampled some of the CSB and enjoyed that immensely as well. For side dishes, we split creamed spinach, asparagus, and macaroni and cheese. The spinach and mac & cheese were particularly out of this world and the asparagus was fresh and delicious, seasoned with some lemon.  We were pretty full after all of that, but some how found a way to muster up the strength for dessert. We decided on splitting the NY Cheesecake and Strawberry Alaskan (basically a strawberry shortcake with ice cream). Let me tell you something...these are enormous desserts! You don't need one per person. One should be enough for a table of 3 or 4 to split. The slice of cheesecake would still have been huge if they cut the sucker in half! Size aside, both desserts were delectable.  Overall, I think you can tell I was a fan of Brand and would recommend this steakhouse to anyone visiting Las Vegas.

Logan's food was surprisingly good.  I admit I wasn't expecting much when I went the first time, but my girlfriend and I went on a Monday night for their two meals for $15 deal (M, T, W only).  For that price you get two entrees with two sides each.  The deal and the food was better than Applebee's.  I recommend the steak or the tilapia.  The baked potato and vegetable skewers were very good sides too.  They have good bread while waiting for your meals.  For $5 more you get an appetizer and dessert to split too.  Again, a better deal than Applebee's.  They lose a star for subpar service.  Sorry guys.

All time favorite lunch spot!  Best cookies you'll find anywhere!  Also fantastic lunches, such as Chicken Walnut and Turkey Cranberry sandwiches.  The salads are excellent too.  I usually create my own, but all of their Signature Salads are delicious. Go here for lunch if you haven't yet, I am sure you'll be pleased.

Tonight was the first time my girlfriend and I ate here after living around the corner of the past 9+ months.  The sushi was very good and the service was very nice and accommodating.  We had the Spicy Dynamite, the JK Special, and the California Roll.  All were excellent and had a very nice presentation.  The egg roll appetizer was disappointing.  They were more like veggie spring rolls than egg rolls really, but I wouldn't rate a restaurant on just a few egg rolls.  My girlfriend and I will be back here for sure!

I have mixed feeling about the W Scottsdale. During the day the pool area is poorly run, but in the evenings the pool turns into a pretty fun nightlife spot.    Daytime: The pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the "worst and trashiest". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.  Nighttime: Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.  Rooms: I've been in a few rooms at this hotel. Each have been nice and clean, but pretty small.

My girlfriend and I celebrated her birthday party here after an incredibly fun daytime scavenger hunt that we designed around Old Town. We made The Lodge the final destination that our hunters had to discover by solving a word puzzle. The five teams figured it out and met us in the pool table room for a private party from 6pm to 8pm. The 20 guests were happy to arrive here for The Lodge's great happy hour which has some cheap beers and half off appetizers until 7pm everyday.   Our guests played pool, video games, and darts while enjoying their drinks and the appetizers we ordered for everyone. I heard the mac and cheese was a must have from fellow Yelper Kyle H and he was dead on. It just might be the best mac and cheese you'll ever have, especially if you add bacon to it. I'm already craving it again! We also ordered our party some chicken wings, chicken strips, cheese curds, and shredded beef nachos. All were crowd pleasers.  There is a nice outdoor patio where patrons can play bags (aka Cornhole). The staff was great too. Dave, the manager, helped me out with the reservation and all went smoothly. Our waiter, the guy with the beard, was very attentive, helpful and friendly. The Lodge has a very cool and relaxed atmosphere which is a nice change from some of the other uppity places in the area.

I finally got to give Daily Dose a try after a long night out in Old Town and it turned out to be just what the doctor ordered. We had a 30 minute wait for breakfast around 11am and it was well worth it. The free coffee they offer outside makes the wait a little more tolerable. When we finally got seated by the friendly host we enjoyed a nice outdoor patio hightop with a heat lamp keeping us warm. Everything on the breakfast/lunch menu sounded appetizing, but ultimately I went with the breakfast nachos. It was a pile of nachos with cheese, chorizo, scrambled eggs, and a side of sausage gravy. Not the healthiest of breakfasts, but a perfect hangover cure that tasted amazing. My girlfriend decided she was more in the lunch mood, so she opted for the Old Town Stack, which consists of shaved prime rib, swiss, horseradish mayonnaise & sweet onion slaw on a toasted pretzel sub roll. Also fantastic and I'd probably get it if I was here for lunch. She also went with the half regular and half sweet potato fries which got a thumbs up from us both. Check out the pics I posted to see what I'm talkin' about!  Overall, Daily Dose was a great food experience, except for the unbelievably obnoxious table of eight sitting nearby who laughed incredibly loud nonstop throughout the entire meal. Seriously, I've never seen or heard any table like it in my entire life. Such "rude and thoughtless little pigs." Everyone on that patio was annoyed with them. Not the restaurant's fault though I suppose.

If my memory serves me correct, this stadium has the same design as Scottsdale Stadium, it's just way WAY west. I was very pleased with this stadium and its surroundings. If I lived out there this would be my go-to Spring Training facility, but since I don't, I'll only go when one of the Dodgers gets me free tickets. Great place, one of the tops I've been to. Check it out!

When I first moved to Phoenix in 2006 I was so moved by the exemplary service and high quality of McDonald's food at this location that I wrote an email letting them know how I feel. I felt this was the best served, freshest tasting McDonald's food I had experienced and the staff was always great and professional. Because of my praising email, they mailed me two free extra value meal coupons. Very nice. All McDonald's should be like this one.   I recognize it is weird reviewing chains (especially a McDonald's), but this one I feel deserved it. Still don't like it? Tough.

I've been wanting to try the parlor for months and I finally got to on Friday for date night with my girlfriend.  I've heard so many good things about this place so I was expecting greatness, but worried I would be disappointed due to all the hype.  I was not disappointed.  I am going to rank The Parlor fourth on my favorite pizza places list in the Valley of the Sun, but I can see it possibly moving up a notch or two after more visits.  I'd like to give The Parlor 4.5 if I could.  I had a sausage pizza with garlic and basil.  My girlfriend had a pepperoni pizza with garlic and basil.  Both were outstanding.  The sauce was great and the cheddar and mozzarella mix was very nice.  Next time I think I'll get a pizza with pepperoni and sausage with garlic and basil.  Another nice thing, they don't charge for the fresh garlic and basil (or any other herbs), unlike some of my other favorite Phoenix pizza places.  The overall prices were very reasonable for a 12" pie.    I definitely plan on becoming a repeat customer of this fine establishment and it won't take me months to do so.

This past Saturday night was the pinnacle of my entire fine-dining life! I'm not joking and I'm not exaggerating, it was that damn good! Thanks to a Yelp event and Petite Maison's generosity, I was fortunate to win a 10 course meal with wine pairings for four people. I have to say, my hopes were very high and I went into the evening expecting to write a five star review. By the end of the night I was left wishing I could give a 10 star rating. Let's see if this review can do any justice to our night. Our reservation was for 7pm and I was accompanied by my fiancee and another couple.  First off, our waiter/sommelier was Dustin. He was an outstanding server and a friendly young man. Dustin was unbelievably informative on each and every dish and wine served. I highly recommend requesting him when you make a reservation. Dustin gave the background and history of each wine along with how you should drink the wine with the food.  We started the night with a Bordeaux Sauvignon Blanc to accompany our first two dishes: bread puffs and a chilled Sweet Corn Soup with Truffle Oil. The bread puffs were freshly baked and delicious, but the soup was especially phenomenal! A great way to start the night.  Next we had a Chardonnay to go along with a Beet, Radish and Multicolored Cauliflower Salad and then a caviar dish. The salad was light and delicious. The caviar was on top of a creamy scrambled egg with truffle I believe. By itself, the caviar was a bit too fishy for me, but when combined with the egg it was very good.   I appreciated this dish even though it wasn't my favorite since it was my first time trying caviar.  A Pinot Noir was the third wine and the first red of the evening. This wine was paired first with pan seared loup de mer, which literally means "wolf of the sea" in French. The fish was incredible! Definitely one of the highlights of the night! You may know it by its Italian name, branzino. We were then served an excellent soft shelled crab dish. It was fried to perfection and served atop a delectable sauce.  The fourth wine of the night blew us all away! We were served a wine by Domaine Faillenc Sainte Marie winery. It was made with a Cinsault grape (pronounced "sinso", or close to that) and it provided the most unique scents and tastes that any of us at the table had experienced. I'll never forget this wine and I am determined to find it somewhere. Thank you Dustin for exposing me to its greatness! My fellow Yelpers, you have to check it out. The Cinsault was paired with duck and lamb dishes. Both meats were out of this world and prepared perfectly, just like every other dish we experienced.  Lastly, the two dessert dishes were accompanied by a port. Not a big port guy, but I guess it's the wine to have when eating dessert. For a port I actually enjoyed this one. The first desert was a slice of baguette served with cheese and fruit. The second were mini chocolate doughnuts with a heavenly cream dipping sauce. Perfect ending to a perfect meal.  Each dish was spaced out perfectly from each other. I was shocked to discover that the Petite Maison culinary masterpiece took four hours. The time absolutely flew by. I ate every single bite and drank every single drop. Thank you Chef James Porter, Dustin, and Yelp for what was the most incredible and memorable dining experience of my life. Seriously, wow! Great food, great company, great memories. It's what life is all about.

After attending this year's burger battle and speaking with Lindsey F. about how great Lobby's burgers are, this place has been on my radar for a while now. I don't get to Tempe very often, but when I did, I was going to be sure to give Lobby's a try. I finally got there yesterday and Lindsey was true to her word, because they made a really tasty burger. Would I rank it #1 on my Best Burgers in Phoenix list? No, but it will certainly make the list!  I ordered a bacon cheese burger with cheddar. One thing that disappointed me was that they don't offer American cheese, but cheddar will do. The burger came out hot, cheesy, and smothered in their homemade sauce. It was very similar to In N' Out's style, but with a bigger burger (1/3lb). The burger was a perfect combination of salty and sweet.  They also offer a burger challenge for some crazy gluttonous patrons to try out. You have only 10 minutes to eat a nonuple cheeseburger and get your photo on their Wall of Fame. Otherwise, it'll set you back $30. I personally think 10 minutes is ridiculous. 15 minutes would be fair. All is all, forget the challenge and get yourself a normal cheeseburger. You'll be very satisfied!

Flatiron Mesa is one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area. Like other reviewers have stated, once you've gotten used to Squaw and Camelback, give this one a try.  It'll kick your ass.  It's about a 2600' climb in elevation, so you're doing more like 2.5 Camelbacks. You'll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really aren't switchbacks. I'd say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down.  It's inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee.  My one recommendation besides the obvious ones (being fit, pack food and water) is to bring some light gloves.  Since you're climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up.  Don't feed the wildlife.

Why did it take me so long to check this hike off my to-do list? This trail is amazing! I've been wanting to hike to a McDowell Mountain peak since I moved to Arizona and when I finally did it this past weekend I was not disappointed. Instead, I was blown away.  At times I felt like I was on a trail that was as good, if not better, than some of hikes I've done in National Parks. After completing this trail, I doubt I'll do Camelback or Squaw ever again. Why would I? This trail is cooler and less crowded.   The trail starts after a drive through a beautiful neighborhood of big homes and then a dirt road. (See directions below.) The hike itself is about 2.1 miles to Tom's Thumb. It is a strenuous, nearly 900 foot climb, up switchback after switchback. You're surrounded by massive scenic boulders throughout the hike to the top. When you get to the Tom's Thumb rock formation itself you will be greeted with an amazing view of the west side of the mountains and the city of Scottsdale down below. Lots of exploring can be done up top so give yourself some extra time.  Here are directions to the trailhead that I found from another website.  They directed me to the trailhead with no problems:  From the Phoenix area, take state HWY-101 North to the Pima Road exit. Drive north on Pima road and turn right onto Happy Valley road. From Happy Valley road, turn right onto Alameda Road (also signed as 115th street). Drive 0.5 miles and turn right onto 119th Way. Drive 0.4 miles and turn left onto Casitas Del Rio. Take this road 0.4 miles and take a left turn on Paraiso Drive. After about 0.1 miles on this road, it will turn to dirt.  The typical trailhead and parking to Tom's Thumb is closed. Follow the signs that point you in the direction for the temporary trailhead parking. From the above directions, continue 0.3 additional miles to an unnamed dirt road and turn right. Drive 0.4 miles to the primitive parking area.

Solid location. Most convenient for me so I'm here often. Always a smooth transaction. They have a drive through ATM and one at the door. I'll be back.   PS: Apparently they don't like 3 wolf moon t-shirts.  Don't care?  Didn't think so.

Holy shit fuck this place is amazing! Hands down, best mother fucking hotel I've ever stayed at!    Bars: Fucking beautiful!  Pools: Off the fucking hook!  Restaurants: Top fucking notch!  Rooms: Jesus fucking Christ they are impressive!  Sorry for the language, but this place is just that fucking great!

My mother and I were excited to spend our recent winnings on a great steak dinner and Vic & Anthony's turned out to be a major disappointment. After seeing the 4.5 star average on Yelp I was expecting greatness, however the food and service were mediocre/poor. I hate to give negative reviews, but this place deserved it in my mind. I hope my Yelp friends who gave this place 4 or 5 stars would crusify me.  My mother had the Tuna Tartar with avocado, citrus vinaigrette & chips. We both liked it, but it didn't blow us away. I ordered the Prime Ribeye with the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. My ribeye came out and we were told the side dishes were coming in "ten seconds".  A few minutes later our waitress came by to see how everything was and I informed her that I still haven't started to eat my steak since I am waiting for my sides. She assured me they will be out shortly. Seven minutes after my steak they finally came! Bullshit! I expect my sides to come out at the same time as my steak so I can enjoy them together. I think that is pretty standard and not an outlandish request. When they were brought to our table there was no apology for the delay. Unlike other steakhouses I have been to Vic & Anthony's didn't serve the first scoop of the side dish onto your plate. I know that makes me sound like some regal, high expectation asshole, but I'm sorry, that's one of the many things that makes the best steakhouses stand out (Mastro's for example). I wasn't crazy about the creamed spinach and the au gratin potatos were waaaaaaay to cheesy for my liking. The steak was not what I was hoping for.  Lastly, our waitress was inattentive, unfriendly, unapologetic, and I don't think smiled once throughout our meal. Maybe it was an off night, but when you are paying big bucks for a nice steak dinner there should be no off nights. I'll be back in downtown Las Vegas in two weeks and I will be sure to avoid Vic & Anthony's.

Convenient location off the 101 on Cave Creek.  It saved my ass today after being stuck in a half hour traffic jam.  Was about to run out of gas completely and I made it just in time and filled up with a solid 17.9 gallons. Priced the same as all the competitors in the area (at least today it was 6/11/11. Happy 98th birthday to my grandfather!).  There's also a McDonald's on the premises so that isn't a bad thing either.    They have a special going on now, 2 Five Hour Energy drinks for $5.

The Grind definitely is home to one of the top burgers in Phoenix with the Sweet and Spicy Burger.  If you're a fan of that combination and love burgers, then you will dig on it for sure.  I guess that is obvious though.    Every time I went to The Grind I sat at the bar and the bartenders are always friendly.  The decor is pretty cool, but they lose points for the massive Sheriff Joe photo.  Come on guys, get that shit down.  Also, is there a Governor Brewer photo up now too?  I sure hope not.  There are certainly better native Arizonians to have up in your establishment if you choose to put up oversized photos.  But hey, for you patrons like me, sit at the bar and then you don't have to lose your appetite having those freaks hovering over you.

I'm from DC and I've been enjoying Five Guys for about 8 years. I still think they are the best fast-food burgers in the business.

I lived in a two bedroom apartment on the third floor for 16 months and I have mostly very positive things to say about the Aspire apartment complex. When I moved in it was run by Trillium, but then was purchased by Weidner. Like any new company taking over an apartment complex, there was some transition time with hiccups, but once they got settled in and worked out their own kinks, they made Aspire one of the best apartment communities I have ever lived in.  First off, the gym is the best I've ever seen in any apartment complex. They have numerous weight machines, free weights, treadmills, stationary bikes, etc. They also have a spin room and aerobics room with P90X and spin classes. There's even a community masseuse available by appointment.  Aspire has two beautiful pools with hot tubs, fire pits, grills, and even a movie theater where you can watch Sunday football or bring in any DVD!   My apartment had a spacious main room, excellent for hosting guests/parties. A great kitchen with an island. My main issues with the apartment were the closet space and bedroom windows. There was no coat closet and the bedroom windows were small and high up, which didn't offer a very good view.   I would recommend young couples and families consider an apartment at Aspire since they offer a wide range of community events/gatherings. The only reason I gave four instead of five stars is because every apartment complex has their imperfections and Aspire is no different. Overall, I was very pleased with my time at Aspire and I think you will be too.

If In N Out and Five Guys burgers mated and created baby burgers, I bet they'd taste just like a Rocket Burger.  I'm so happy I randomly found this hidden Phoenix gem.  But I do have to give some thanks to Yelp for helping me decide where to go for lunch last month. Their burgers really are like a best of In n Out and Five Guys.  They use the thousand island dressing on the burgers like In N Out.  The cheese is a lot like Five Guys and the fries are similar too (Rocket's are better).  Great cheese curds.  Also, they are apparently known for their root beer selection.  I'm not a root beer guy, but they do have a very extensive collection.  So if you love root beer, this is definitely your place.  Overall, one of the best places for a burger in the valley for sure!  I'll be back again and again and again...

Rocket Burger is totally out of this world!  This place blasted into my universe about a year ago and I have been coming in for frequent landings ever since.  Rocket has arguably the best burger in Universe! I bet the astronauts on all of those Apollo missions and up on the space station wish they had it this good.    Steve and Denis, the owners, are both really nice guys. "Fresh is where it's at" at Rocket Burger and they have over 300 sodas in stock! But hey, don't take my word for it. Let's hear what the Steve and Denis have to say...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MqQQvX0Ock  Gotta love that commercial. I wish it played on local TV.   I'm telling you this place is seriously really great. I always go with a bacon double cheeseburger, with pickles, onions, jalapenos, and man oh man that Rocket Sauce. I think I could drink it! Good thing I don't though. Check out my picture from this place. I mean seriously, how good does that look?!? I also recommend getting a side of their ranch for your fries. I know, I'm sounding like a total health nut right now, but bear with me. I think this place would be a perfect candidate for Diners, Drive Ins, & Dives.  It's T minus 10 and counting until I get in my car and blast off to Rocket Burger and Subs. I'm sure the burger and fries will have another great landing in my belly.  Get Your Rocket On!

Shouldn't the food you name your restaurant after actually taste good?   Why people go here for wings instead if Zipps or Half Moon is beyond me.  Only good thing about this place is that they have all the games on TV. Otherwise, food sucks.

I've been coming to this location for the past three years and I have no complaints. Every time I come in for an eye exam and contacts the whole process runs smoothly and I have had no major issues. It's convenient and at a reasonable price I don't see why I'd go anywhere else. Not much to report here really other than after about four visits, this place is batting 1.000 (that's "they have been perfect" for the non-baseball fans out there).

I have been to Vegas over a dozen times now, starting in 2003, and I can say it has gotten better and better over the years.  If I was writing this review ten years ago, I'd probably give it 3 stars. But with the recent additions of The Cosmopolitan, Aria, Wynn, and the revamping of many old hotels, there are so many great options for food, fun, gambling, entertainment, and pools.    Even after eight years of avoiding Downtown Vegas, it too has gotten better over time.  It is definitely still cheaper and tackier than The Strip, but this is Vegas, so it all works.  Downtown has some remodeled hotels as well, so you can actually find some nice rooms there for a fraction of the Strip prices.  Give it a try.   My Top 3 Hotels: 1) The Cosmopolitan 2) The Wynn 3) The Bellagio  The Cosmopolitan is home to my favorite bars and restaurant.  For me, it doesn't get any better than Bond and The Chandelier bars or more delicious than Scarpetta.  Also, I'm not a guy who goes to clubs, but the Marquee Day Club is a great time.  These are all must dos when in Vegas.  Here's my overall list for Vegas: http://www.yelp.com/list/vegas-las-vegas-114

I don't see what the problem is with CityScape and why it is getting so many negative reviews. I like it hear and I have found myself at CityScape almost every trip I take to the downtown area. My top CityScape places:  Stand Up Live Copper Blues Five Guys Breakfast Club  I haven't tried Arrogant Butcher yet, but I want to. The only place I didn't like was Vitamin T. That place was gross and dirty, overpriced, bland food, and just a total bummer.   Also, the parking at CityScape is great. The prices are decent and the businesses will validate. It is close to US Airways Center and Chase Field. I'm done with Sliders as my pregame watering hole. Copper Blues is way way better for food and drinks!

This is the nearest Greek restaurant to my apartment and I couldn't be happier with it. My girlfriend (One Review Stephanie) and I often get take out from here when looking to satisfy our gyro cravings. I also recommend the falafel.  It is $2.50 for a side order of four, but they'll even do a half order for only $1.25. Good deal. The serving sizes are very big and the gyros are stuffed to the max with meat. I've tried many of the dishes there and have never been disappointed. It is definitely our go-to place for Greek eats! The Greek Pita also offers many American options as well.

Simply put, this is the best buffet you will find in Las Vegas or anywhere.  Each trip I made to pick items from the buffet I was continually amazed.  I thoroughly enjoyed the mac n' cheese bar, gnocchi, potatoes, crab legs, prime rib, chicken tikka masala, and the desserts.  The waitress was very attentive and helpful throughout our table's extended stay.  I'll definitely be back to Wicked Spoon during my next visit to Vegas, whether I'm staying at Cosmopolitan or not.

One of the coolest bars I've been to in Vegas or anywhere.  It is almost like a club right there on the casino level of the hotel.  Most people talk about The Chandelier when discussing Cosmopolitan bars, and it is extremely cool, but I think I prefer Bond.  There's so much constant stimulation going on, whether it's the lights, music, go-go dancers, or people watching.  The bar is especially stunning at night time when the lights are in full effect inside the bar.  Prices are a little steep, but this is Vegas and you're at the hottest new hotel on The Strip so what would you expect?   The Cosmopolitan is doing it right in every category of night life and entertainment.  Bond is a must visit while visiting Las Vegas Blvd.

This place is so money, and if you didn't know it, I'm talking about $15 million. That's the price tag for the chandelier that is surrounding you in the bar (at least that's what one of the Cosmopolitan employees told me). The Chandelier has been reviewed a lot and has a high star average for a good reason... it's probably the hottest bar in the hottest hotel in Vegas!  I recommend level 1.5. That's right 1.5. Grab a seat at one of the couches, order a drink from the snooty waitress whose shit clearly doesn't stink, sit back and people watch. The only other bar that can rival this one at the Cosmopolitan is Bond. Very different, but very worth checking out as well.  Chandelier and Bond are where it's at my Vegas party goers. Anyone offering another idea should be ostracized from your group.

"Excuse me, where's Vesper Bar?" I asked a Cosmopolitan Black Jack dealer.  "Go this way, pass all the good stuff and it'll be on your right," he accurately replied.   To save some time he should have just answered, "Who cares?"   I know this place gets a lot of high reviews, but come one, when you have the Chandelier and Bond bars in the vicinity, why would you bother with this one. I don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but every time I'm in here I'd rather be at Chandelier or Bond.  When I pass by and look at the Vesper patrons, I think, why aren't they at Chandelier or Bond...or even Book and Stage?!? Vesper is a nice place, don't get me wrong, but when I come to Vegas and the prices for a drink are all the same at each bar, I'm goin' to the one that wows me the most every time. My advice...step out of the elevator, make a right, pass by the Vesper and keep on walking!   Ok, one positive thing I will say about Vesper is that it can be a great place for people watching late at night. Ya know, the people who have spent the night in Vegas going somewhere more fun than Vesper and are now stumbling to the elevators on the final stretch back to their room.

As I mentioned in my review for the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, this pool is "Off the fucking hook"!    Total party pool so don't bring a book and expect to relax.  Wanna relax?  Go with the other lame-o's to the Boulevard or Bamboo pools.  The drinks and food are expensive, but what else would you expect at a Vegas pool?  I had the Lobster Club sandwich with fries.  Quite possibly the best club sandwich I ever had.  Hey, you replace the turkey and ham with lobster and some spicy sauce and how could it not be the best?  PS- The Boulevard and Bamboo pools are actually very cool and not full of "lame-o's", just a different, more chill scene than the Marquee.

Their lobster club just might be the greatest sandwich I've ever had. Seriously.  Every time I stay at Cosmopolitan I will be sure to stop by the Marquee Day Club for this sandwich.  The price is $22, but it is totally worth it and easy to split, so for $11 per person I see it as a good deal.  The sandwich comes with lobster, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo and comes with excellent seasoned fries.    The bartenders also make excellent mojitos and painkillers (piña colada)!  Be ready to spend your money if you are looking to drink and eat though.  Specialty drinks are $12-$14.  You're on vacation, why not?  Finish your meal, grab your drink and enjoy a party at the pool!  Get there early.  Hotel guests get in free before 2pm.  Grab a towel and put it somewhere on the side of the pool if you aren't planning to spend a small fortune for lounge chairs.

I'm from south NJ and what I miss the most is the great bread.  Jersey Mike's has the best bread over any other sandwich shops I've been to in Arizona and makes me feel like I am back east.  I recommend the white over the wheat personally.  I am a big fan of their hoagies and especially the roast beef and turkey sandwich with bacon.  Also their cheesesteak is very good.  I haven't had the tuna yet, but my friend has and he loved it.  Very delicious food here and I haven't been disappointed yet!

The not-so-secret Secret Pizza is a perfect place to grab a slice or two for lunch or late night. The lines can get long, so beware. This place is really effing good NY style pizza and it's located at the end of a hallway on the third floor near the pool tables. I've tried a variety of different topping slices here and each have been great.  Are you and your friends planning on getting four or more slices? I'd recommend ordering a whole pizza instead since it'll work out to be about the same price. I think our pepperoni and sausage pie was $24. Not bad really. You can play some pinball and other arcade games as you wait. Out of quarters? The people watching here is great too!

Went here when the Wicked Spoon buffet line was too long on Sunday morning and so glad I did.  This place had fantastic food and service was very good.  My girlfriend and I both had the Build Your Own Burgers.  I was still in the mood for breakfast so I had mine topped with bacon and an egg, as well as avocado and cheddar cheese.  I requested it medium rare and it was prepared perfectly.  My girlfriend had hers with mushroom, bacon and cheddar (she gives this place 4 out of 5 stars).  As our sides we tried the fries and tatter tots.  Both were great.  Ask for a side of their ranch too, outstanding!  I highly recommend going to The Henry over the Wicked Spoon since you will save time and money.  I'll definitely be back when visiting the Cosmopolitan.

Upper Crust is like Grimaldi's on steroids. The two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. Upper Crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which I am not crazy about. The wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey BBQ sauce. The meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but Stephanie H would disagree. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 7pm and on Wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine.   Overall, it is a very good pizza and I plan on returning. Next time I'll be giving that pizza cookie a try. I really liked Upper Crust, but Grimaldi's in Old Town is still my favorite for traditional NY style thin crust pizza.

I have eaten at Tacos Atoyac a half a dozen times and sampled much of the menu, but I always find myself going back to these three: 1) Fish Tacos 2) Shrimp Burrito 3) Crispy Quesidilla  Those three items make me a regular here. I have also tried the asada, pastor and chorizo tacos. They are small and cheap which is nice, but I don't love them since the soft tortillas are a little dry for my liking. That being said, the top three items I mentioned are 5 stars all the way and I am addicted to each of them!  It is nice that you get salsa and avocado sauce on the side for free.  I often find myself falling into a deep dark depression on Monday nights when I am getting a fish taco craving and I see they are closed as I drive by. Ugh, tonight may be one of those nights. :(

Of the seven Cactus League Spring Training facilities I have been to for a game, this is far and away the best one. It's not surprising it would be the best considering it is the newest and home to our Arizona Diamondbacks! Oh...and the Colorado Rockies. SRF has a great seating area, but I feel all the fun is had on the lawn. Maybe not the best view of the game, but you're not going to a Spring Training game to watch baseball anyway, are you? It's all about hanging with friends, having some beers and people watching. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge baseball fan, but I'm estimating the average over/under on pitches I watch at a Spring Training game to be around 20.  If you're going on a weekend, I recommend getting there a little early if you are with a big group so you have space to put down a blanket. Only a few going? You should be fine finding a spot around game time.   Big tip of the review: Go to Zipps on Via de Ventura and Hayden for pregame food and drinks and then take their shuttle over to the stadium.

Gotta love a place at any stadium across the country that charges only $1.50 for hotdogs, corn dogs, soda, and more.  The Value Menu is where it's at! Sure they are smaller, but get 2 hotdogs for $3.  Shit, get 3 hotdogs for $4.50! Still an amazing deal for a baseball game.

This is the newest Zipps in the valley and my favorite. The food is the most consistently delicious and I still stand by my previous statement that Zipps has the best bar food in the state!  Best wings, great burgers, awesome Monaco Facaccia. Great happy hour, reverse happy hour, and weekend specials. Fun atmosphere, bar games, and lots of TVs. I just named nine reasons why this place is great. I could go on.  Fantastic chicken strips, onion rings, and fries. They even have the best dipping sauces, like the ranch or the blue cheese or the jalapeno sauce. We're at twelve now. Want 15? Ok. The Zipparita, 32oz domestics on HH, and John Dalys. I like to give three examples at a time.  For example: Nice staff, reliable take out, convenient shuttle to games. 18. To be continued...

This is my new favorite place to go to at the new City Scape in downtown Phoenix. The food, drinks, music, and atmosphere are all great. Copper Blues is the perfect decision for pre-show drinks and dinner. The restaurant is attached to the Stand Up Live comedy club and this past weekend my girlfriend and I met up with another couple at the restaurant before seeing Stephen Rannazzisi.   For an appetizer we all really enjoyed the French Onion Dip with some BBQ potato chips, despite my girlfriend's hesitation to order this dish since it was "something you can easily pick up at the grocery store." For the main course three of us got the Copper Blues Burger, which has cheddar cheese, hickory bacon, roasted onions and tomato jam. Usually I'd do without the tomato jam, but I figured the hell with it and kept it on. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I have to say, I wasn't expecting it, but I was blown away by this burger and I'm definitely adding it to my list of best burgers in Phoenix. My friend's wife had the Caprese sandwich. Pretty standard, but it looked very good. All sandwiches came with a side of their house made BBQ chips, which we all ended up using to dip in the left over French Onion Dip.   For the beer aficionados there are over 60 beers on tap. Check out their extensive list here:  http://copperblueslive.com/page.cfm?id=1028  Me? I'll take a Coors Light.

Yelpers giving this place four or five stars are either seriously misguided, don't have refined pallets, or simply haven't tried Bianco or Cibo.  This place was over priced, had fairly poor service, and the pizza just wasn't that good.  I ordered the sausage pizza.  The sausage was pretty bland.  They also screwed up my order by adding onions when I didn't ask for them.  I've had my order messed up on pizzas before by having toppings left off, but never added on that I simply didn't order.  Found that strange.  I would have sent it back, but the waiter didn't check to see how everything was until about fifteen minutes after the food was brought to the table.  I'd give Humbe Pie 1.5 stars if I could, but rounded up since it is better than Dominos and Pizza Hut.  I went after buying the GroupOn coupon, but won't be returning.

I personally didn't make a habit of going to this place, but I can see how one could.  There are many delicious burger options in Phoenix and The Habit Burger Grill is worth mentioning on that list.  The burgers are tender and juicy, very delicious and cooked just right.  Delicious salty fries.  Service is fast and perfect for to go orders.  Upon my return to the Phoenix metro area, I will consider The Habit more often when I crave a burger...and that is pretty often.

The Casablanca is officially my new favorite place in Old Town Scottsdale!  Wanna know why?  Read more!  My girlfriend and I went here on the two week anniversary of The Casablanca's opening, a Saturday night at around 10pm.  Before sitting at a table, we toured the place to see where we wanted to sit.  The decor was beautiful and would have been happy anywhere.  The weather was perfect so we wanted to sit outside, but all of the tables were reserved.  Empty, but reserved.  We grabbed a booth inside while we waited for our friend's to arrive.  We were greeted by a friendly waitress who handed us our light up menus.  That's right, these menus had fancy LED lighting in them.  It was a very cool effect that I have never seen before and it made them easier to read in the dark booth.  So not only cool, by useful.  Our friend's joined us at our booth and were also intrigued by the menu lights.  I asked the waitress for a mixed drink recommendation and she went off on how great the Seasonal Buck tastes.  Another waiter came up and also stated how it was his favorite drink.  I figured it's a new place, that's their specialty drink, everyone is raving about it, I've never had it or heard of it, so why not.  A round of Seasonal Bucks please!  The waitress brought the four drinks out and they were in this cool as hell copper mug that we all wanted to steal.  (Don't worry Casablanca, we didn't).  Then we all tried the drink.  I'd say it was a unanimous decision that it was the best tasting mixed drink each of us has ever had.  I'd go back just for this drink.  Seriously.  We had to order another round.  More friends arrived and they informed us that they had a reserved table outside with drink service.  We joined them for some Red Bull and vodkas.  Comfortable seats, perfect weather, nice views of the streets below, more friendly wait staff.  I think the lounge is going to take off once more people hear of it.  The Casablanca will definitely be my go to place when looking for a fun night out in Old Town.  There are plenty of reasons to go, but if for no other reason, go to The Casablanca Lounge for the Seasonal Buck drink.  Damn, that's a tasty drink!  PS: Just found a YouTube video on how to make the Seasonal Buck: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz1Q-cLFDDw

This place probably isn't what you came to Cosmopolitan for, but I bet you'll find yourself in Vitals at some point during your trip. Wanna bring home a souvenir? Vitals sell a variety of Cosmopolitan/Las Vegas stuff.  Had a late night and you're stumbling back to your room? Grab a bottle of water and a snack to ease your hangover. Came down with an illness or forgot something in your bathroom bag? Vitals is stocked with medicine. Forgot pool supplies? Vitals has sunglasses and sunblock. Got lucky and need some protection? Vitals has condoms for ya. Didn't get lucky? Vitals has adult magazines too!  The prices may be more expensive than your local convenience store, but this is a hotel in Las Vegas. What did you expect? Just be thankful it is open 24/7.  Please gamble responsibly.

Alright Phoenix, it's time to stop losing your collective shit over Smashburger. I'll probably get crucified for saying this, but does anyone else out there feel like they're eating McDonalds when they're having a Smashburger?  Now don't get me wrong, McDonalds isn't quite as greasy or salty tasting as Smashburger, but the two still are very similar. Oh, except one thing, McDonalds fries are way better. Every time I've had fries from Smashblah they are over fried, making them too stiff and tasteless. Plus this place is way over priced. So I guess that's two differences.  Put it this way, if Delux or Rocket Burger were next door to Smashburger, then 10 times outta 10, I'm passing by Smashburger and going to the other places.  Now, if McDonalds was right next door to Smashburger...yeah, I'd probably still skip Smashburger and save my money.

I've lived just south of this shopping center for 9 months and have been a regular since day one. Whether I'm shopping at Walmart or eating at one of the many restaurants, I'll find myself at the Happy Valley Towne Center daily. Everyone talks about Norterra when I tell them where I live. Well, I think this place is better and more useful overall.  Best of Happy Valley Towne Center: 1) Ray's Pizza 2) The Greek Pita 3) Logan's Roadhouse 4) Jersey Mike's 5) Shane's Rib Shack 6) Cold Stone Creamery 7) Starbucks 8) Lowe's 9) Barne's and Noble 10) Sports Chalet  Worst of Happy Valley Towne Center: 1) The McDonalds inside of Walmart 2) Walmart 3) Olive Garden 4) Carl's Jr. 5) Applebee's 6) Red Robin 7) Panda Express 8) TGI Fridays 9) Super Cuts 10) Walmart  Who cares: 1) L & L BBQ 2) Bajio 3) Hall of Frames Eh, who cares about these.

Solid location. I recommend Nicky. She gets my haircut right every time. That's all I have to say really.

Unless I'm in Vegas, I don't do buffets. So you should take my 4 star review for a buffet like it's an 8 star review from someone who normally goes to buffets. Like I said, I don't do buffets outside of Vegas, but when another food obsessed friend who also doesn't eat at buffets begged and pleaded with me to check out Jasmine Tokyo, I knew something was up. I opened my Yelp app, read the many positive reviews, and saw they even had a Check-In offer for $5 off. Sold!  Jasmine Tokyo is located near Scottsdale Road and Shea, where the old Claim Jumper used to be. It's $20 for dinner and I believe $12 for lunch. The Asian calamari, walnut shrimp, stuffed shrimp, chicken skewers, and beef dishes were some of my favorites. They were all seriously awesome and I went back up to refill my plate at least twice. Also very good were the many varieties of sushi (they even offered sashimi!).   For desert they offered a variety of cakes, such as chocolate, german chocolate, cheesecake, and I think lemon. They also had vanilla, chocolate, and rice puddings. Cookies, fresh fruit, jello and more!  I chowed down at Jasmine Tokyo and I am looking forward to my next visit! I didn't get to try the crab legs, Mongolian stir fry, and some of the other beef and seafood options, but I feel I had my share and left very satisfied. Check it out, even if you are anti-buffet like me.

I recently received a Living Social deal to this place from my girlfriend. I'm a hard sell when it comes to a new barber shop. If I move to a new area and find a barber that I like, I'll stick with him/her until I move or they die. Add on the fact that Kenon R.'s recent review was less than flattering and I'm walking in a bit anxious.   Thanks to Kenon's review I also knew to check in first with the barber section and not the bar. The friendly girl behind the counter asked what beer I'd like and then introduced me to my barber, Alex. Alex was a friendly guy, very personable, upbeat, and it turned out I was very pleased with my haircut! What a relief! I usually just go with Great Clips, so when I got a straight razor shave on my neck and around my ears after my haircut I was pretty surprised. I dug that. Believe it or not, I think I'm sold on this place and I might come back. It is $20 for a haircut and $2 for a beer. Next time I'll just skip the beer and get the haircut. The beer is a nice touch, but not necessary. Maybe it was just what I needed on this first visit to take the edge off.  One last thing. Before I went I was always wondering if hair would end up in my beer. Well, they give you the beer with a shot glass on top so it covers the bottle neck, thus avoiding a hairy beer. Nice.

Nice, new and clean. I like this Circle K, but all Circle K's lose a star for overcharging for 5 Hour Energy drinks. Also, they charge 75 cents for air. I'd rather go to QT where the air is free.

During my great Phoenix booze search in the fall of  2012, I turned to my trusty Yelp friends on Talk and proposed the question: Where is the best place to go for a good selection of whiskeys at a decent price. I got many useful responses, but Marsella M. hit the nail right on the head when she suggested The Little Woody. I never heard of the place and it was close to my home so I was intrigued. I checked it out one night after work and had some trouble finding the place since there are no signs. I figured out where it was when I saw the neon owl in the window. As you walk up to the door you don't know what to expect and it feels like you are going into the back entrance of a restaurant. Upon opening the door though, you are immediately greeted by a cool relaxed lounge, perfectly decorated and welcoming.   This is an all around great bar and I might rank it as my favorite in Phoenix now. It has all the elements to make it a great place for a drink and some food. 1) It's hidden, so you have to be in the know to find it. 2) Great bartenders, drinks, and specials 3) Very cool and modern decor 4) There are two separate rooms, each with a different vibe. The main room with the bar has couches, a long high top, and booths. The back room has some great games, including skee ball, darts, foosball table, and I think a pinball machine. Great overall set up for whatever you're in the mood to do.  Also... Plenty of whiskey flights to choose from. On Mondays they get new drinks for the patrons to try out. Lots of Four Peaks beers. Their house special is called The Codger: $5 for a can of Old Style and a shot of Old Grand Dad.   This place had the Review of the Day yesterday on Yelp, so it seems the secret is out and I'm sure more and more people will start flocking to Phoenix's best secret bar.   Ya know what, this place stinks. Don't go here ever...unless you already do, then you can still go. Otherwise, it isn't worth your time. Seriously. Just go to Buffalo Wild Wings.

"Would you like some stamps or ice with that?"  With my Snickers bar? No thanks, they don't go well together. How about this, Circle K..."If I wanted stamps or ice I WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THEM!"  Ugh, I can't stand this Circle K. Always trying to up sell me on shit I don't need. It ain't that clean either. It's jam packed with the many farm and construction workers in the area so it is convenient for them. The location earns them a second star since there isn't much in the area. Also, Circle K fixed their overcharging for 5 Hour Energy drinks by offering a 2 for $5(reg) and 2 for $6 (extra strength) special. I don't know, probably still too much for them, but they help me get through the day.

I've been meaning to put this review up for a while to thank Big O Tires and Rob for a job well done. My experiences here have been more like Hillary's and not Tanya's. Rob is the man! A complete professional, very friendly and personable and makes you feel like your car is in good hands (which it is!).    Rob will make sure you are completely taken care of and make your car "right as rain". My girlfriend and I brought in our cars before a cross country road trip to get a good amount of work done. Big O was quick and we have no complaints about the quality of their work. I since have moved away from Arizona, but if and when I return in a couple years, I'll be sure to return to this Big O for my car maintenance needs.

I can now say I've tried veal testicles. Damn you AZ Taco Festival!   Overall, I dug the AZ Taco Festival now that it is in its new location by Salt River Fields. There were many taco booths, each selling street tacos for $2 (1 ticket). Some of the best were Distrito (pork), Four Seasons (pork), and Cottonwood (shrimp).  There were some other food options as well for your taco hating friends who were dragged to this event. But really, as the festival's slogan goes, "who doesn't love tacos?" There were non food tents too, selling jewelry and other junk you don't need. Lots of beer tents, a wedding, wrestling, go-cart racing and a play area for kids.  One tip for future Taco Fest goers: You might wanna go Saturday instead of Sunday. I noticed about a half dozen empty tents on Sunday that were apparently occupied the day before.  Great moment: Noticing the drunk guy from the Sandbar tent was taking part in the taco eating contest, predicting he would puke, and then seeing him so so on stage.  Boring Part of the Festival: The rest of the taco eating contest. Couldn't hear announcer and I was expecting to see these dudes going nuts eating as many tacos as they could. Instead it was something about spicy tacos I think. Contest started, they took their time eating, I was bored. Change this please.   Weakest aspect of the festival: El Hefe tent filling up as many beer cup as they can, to just have them sit there getting warm and then serving them. Weak! I had no problem returning my warm beer for a fresh cold pour.   It was nice meeting Yelp's new intern, Jenny R., at the Yelp booth! Special thanks to Yelp for the 50% off discount code on tickets!

This place deserves a five star review because the food was awesome and the waitress was very friendly. What more do you need really?  In our table for two, we both ordered the Country Fried Steak, eggs, potatoes, and pancakes.  A huge breakfast and all 4 parts of it were perfect.  They offered this monstrous meal for only $9.99.  Also, I love when diners do this, they left the big pot of coffee on the table for us to refill ourselves.  Very convenient.  If I find myself in this neighborhood around breakfast again, I will be sure to pop in.

This has to be my favorite Fry's that I have been to.  Located in the Kierland area, for the first three years I lived in Scottsdale this was my local grocery store and Wells Fargo Bank.  It is always clean, well organized and well stocked with whatever you need.  Displays are nice too.  Can't go wrong with Boar's Head at the deli (although, all Fry's carry Boar's Head).  This Fry's has also been convenient for me since there is a Wells Fargo in the store.  I miss this grocery store and I hope to move back to the Kierland area again some day.
