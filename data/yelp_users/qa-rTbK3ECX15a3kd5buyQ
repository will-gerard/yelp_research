There's Chicken Fried Steak, and then there's Texaz's Chicken Fried Steak.  The menu is small and consists mostly of meat and anything fried. Keep your cardiologist on speed dial if you come here often. The décor is quirky and fun. You could sit at every table in this restaurant and still not see everything they have to offer hanging on the walls.   The only dilemma I have when I come here is whether to order the Chicken Fried Steak or the Chicken Fried Chicken. Both equally delicious.  Both served with a heaping mound of mashed potatoes and gravy... oh the gravy... it is so delicious I could drink it with a straw.   The portion size here is HUGE. Do not try to eat everything they serve you; your stomach will likely implode.

I was recently in a fender bender with my car, and as I'm extremely picky about how my car looks, I wanted the job done right.  I took my car to USA Collision with high hopes and they definitely delivered!   The staff was very honest with me about the repairs. Being a woman, I appreciated the fact that I didn't feel taken advantage of.  I was very impressed with the quality of the repair and how USA Collision took my concerns to heart.  My car looks brand new, just like the day I got it! Hopefully I don't have anymore accidents, but if I do, I will surely be visiting USA Collision again!

As soon as I pull into the parking lot I want to sprint into the building and jot down my order as fast as possible. I know exactly what I want. A Surfer Roll. It's my favorite thing on their menu and the moment it hits my table I'm like a ninja with my chop sticks ready to eat. They do have a variety of other rolls, and I enjoy quite a few of them, but nothing compares to the Surfer Roll.  The service can be hit or miss and some of the prices are a smidge high, but overall definitely worth 4 stars!

If you're a part of my family you know that no holiday is complete without a Honey Baked Ham.  We came in here to purchase a ham for Easter and I was really surprised by everything they had to offer other than ham! All these delicious looking condiments and RUM CAKE!   It took us awhile because we had to look at everything they were selling. Eventually we picked out three different style condiments; Spicy Chipotle Mayo, Honey Mustard Mayo and Horseradish Sauce.   We arrived at the counter and asked the gentleman a couple questions about the ham we wanted to purchase. He said he was a new employee and would find out the answers for us. I really appreciate that he was willing to step away and help a customer other than just attend to the register.  He came back with the answers we needed and we decided to buy an 8 pounder.   As always the service we received was fantastic and the ham tastes delicious! I would like to come back here to try some of the sandwiches they have to offer, and buy a rum cake!

If you ever have a chocolate craving... See's is the place to go.  Every time I have been here I get a free chocolate! If that doesn't get you in the door, I don't know what will.   It always smells sweet and inviting. Everyone behind the counter is always smiling and helpful (I would probably be smiling too if I worked around chocolate all day). And the candies themselves are legendary... C'mon you all know the little white See's Chocolate boxes I'm talking about.    I love this little store and have for many years. Those chocolates are totally worth some extra calories!

I will never go anywhere else for my jewelry/diamond needs!  My husband purchased my engagement ring from Shane Co. more than 2 years ago. He was extremely impressed with their knowledge and value (trust me I know how hard it is to impress this man).  We returned later in the year to pick out a band that would match my engagement ring.  We found a few we liked but none of them matched my existing engagement ring the way we wanted. Shane Co. actually took a wedding band and modified it to meet our needs. Once the ring was modified it was PERFECT!   After our wedding we had a few days before leaving on our honeymoon. I took my engagement ring and wedding band in to be soldered. Once again I wanted to modify my band slightly so it would sit flush with my engagement right once it was soldered. After 3 days I picked up my ring. WOW! is an understatement!  I receive compliments all the time on how beautiful my ring is and I tell everyone I know who is looking at jewelry or thinking of proposing to go to Shane.   Even after having my ring for a few years now the warranty and customer service is flawless (just like their diamonds!).  I take it in to be cleaned and inspected every 6 months and it is always returned to me looking brand new.

Wow, holy curry explosion. I wouldn't say I'm a gyro expert but do enjoy eating them from time to time. This was my first experience with Gyros Express and I don't think I will be going back.  The price seemed a little high and although the gyro was full of meat, all I could taste was curry... and I like curry. Just not an entire spice rack full. Definitely not what I was hoping for.

As far as it goes, you can't find a better sushi "happy hour" in the valley. And by "happy hour" I mean almost all day every day (exception is Friday and Saturday 5:00 - 8:00 PM). Included in happy hour is a $5.00 Sake Bomb special. How can you beat that?! My husband and I can both get a drink, 2 rolls each and get out of there for $35.00. It is definitely our favorite cheap date place! Not only are the prices great, the food is awesome.   Due to the fact that this place has amazing food/prices/drinks/everything it can get super busy (it's not a very large restaurant) so you may want to call ahead if you are going with a group of 4+. They do have 2 large patio areas that are very pleasant to sit at when the weather is nice  Two thumbs up all around!

I know I'm not paying for 5 star service at a Taco Bell, but sheesh!   When we arrived, there were 2 other people in the entire place.  We stood near the registers ready to order but there was nobody there to help. After a minute or two, a man came to take our order.  He definitely loved his job... not.  After Mr. Ray of Sunshine took our order he forgot to give us our drink cups and walked away.  I volunteered to wait at the register to get the drink cups while the rest of the party I was with sat down.  The girl working the drive through window kept looking over and ignoring me as I stood there trying to get her attention.  She kept huffing and puffing and stomping around.  Finally after looking at me six times (yes I counted) she says "Ugh, did somebody help you?" I mentioned that we did not receive our drink cups.  So she stomped over and goes "here" and slams our drink cups on the counter.  Wow, sorry for making you take an extra 4 steps to help a customer when there is no one even in the drive through line!    After the drink cup fiasco, it took about 15 minutes to get our food.  Once again I know I'm not paying for 5 star service, but I could probably make the tacos I ordered faster in my own kitchen.  Especially when there are only 5 people in the whole restaurant.   We finally got our food and started eating. Then an employee still in uniform starts noisily talking on his cell phone behind the counter about how "I'm getting off work in about 10 minutes, blah blah blah, let's make our entire nights plans while being extremely rude to the customers".  Can't this conversation wait until you are off work?! This was highly unprofessional... and annoying.  Aside from the aggravating customer service, the restaurant was clean and my tacos turned out decent.   All in all, I would suggest using the drive though, at least then you have minimum contact with the extremely rude employees.  Or better yet, go to a different Taco Bell with pleasant employees.

The original George & Son's; oh I love you so much.  I can remember the first time my (now husband) took me on a date here. I even remember thinking to myself... If this guy ever breaks up with me I'm going to come back and eat here all the time. The food is THAT GOOD.  Over 4 years later and we even had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here.  My entire family dines here, and we refuse to go anywhere else for Asian/Chinese food.   I have tried numerous things on the menu and am never disappointed.  There is a scallop appetizer that will blow your mind. Seriously, so yummy.   All the entrees are a decent portion size. Honestly, I always tell myself that I will take half of it home, but I can never stop myself from eating everything in front of me.   The service is always kind and attentive. For the prices and quality/quantity of the food you will not find anything better!

I'm a native, and this is one of my guilty pleasures.   I've been going to The Horny Toad with my parents since I can remember. My mom and I stopped in for lunch and it wasn't very busy. Our server came right out and was very pleasant.   I don't think I've ever ordered anything here besides the deep fried zucchini and the fried chicken.  (Like I said one of my guilty pleasures)  The deep fried zucchini are delicious, but be careful, they can be super hot when they hit your plate.  The fried chicken on the menu is listed as "Our Famous Fried Chicken" "Plucked & Fresh NOT Frozen". They're not using that term lightly, it's definitely famous in my mind. Carve into that bird and the succulent juices start running down your knife. With your fist bite your whole mouth bursts with flavor.  I could almost eat the whole bird... seriously they serve you an entire chicken.  You can order the "half" option but you'll be disappointed without the left overs.  I don't think they've changed the recipe in 20 years and I'll be back for many more years to come.

Honestly, the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars was because the cheesecake was heavenly. Everything else was a disaster; and this place deserves 1 star.  To start off... we had a reservation for 7:30. The reservation was for 20 people. (Yes I know serving 20 people can be very difficult, but it can be done... Apparently this is not something that can be done at Maggiano's.)   When we arrived the hostesses needed an EXACT number of people who would be dining. That would be 20; hence the reservation for 20 people... This was about 10 minutes of pointless back and forth with the hostess and how many freaking chairs needed to be at the table. 20! SHEESH!   The next run around we got was that we were not allowed to be seated until all of the guests had arrived. After some of our guests arrived a few minutes later we were still all standing in the lobby. We were told our table would now be ready in 15 minutes. After 20 minutes of clogging up the front door and part of the bar area we walked up to the hostess and asked what the status was. Once again our table would be ready in 15 minutes. Another 20 minutes painfully ticked by. Oh did I mention we had a 3 month old and a toddler in the group? Anyone with a baby/toddler knows how great it can be waiting 45 minutes for a table. NOT!   50 minutes after our reservation had passed we were called up to be seated. Not one of the 3 hostesses apologized or even batted an eye that we had been standing there for 50 minutes?!?! ARE YOU FOR REAL!?  Once we were seated we were understandably STARVING. Two waiters appeared to take our drink order. The young lady who helped was pleasant and very hospitable, but the gentleman who served us was rude! RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! Like we did something wrong spending our money at this establishment.  We asked him if the toddler who was with us could get his water ASAP, as the long wait had been hard on him. He looked at us like we were from another planet. Not only did he not apologize for the wait he huffed and puffed and started stammering "YOU HAVE TO BEAR WITH US".   WE HAVE BEEN BEARING WITH YOU FOR AN HOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!   The rudeness continued throughout the entire meal.   After all of this, the food was mediocre. Nothing special. Bland.  We were never apologized to from any of the staff nor were we even offered a fee appetizer or drink for the wait.   If I ever return to this restaurant I can assure you it will be by force and not by choice. I can find good cheesecake at a lot of other restaurants that will be happy to take my money.

Whoever Jason is... he's doing something right.  I stop in here for lunch every now and then and always enjoy my meal. The variety available of soups/salads/sandwiches is sure to please any palate. The wait staff is always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is casual and the place is consistently clean!   I really enjoy the salad bar with its assortment of organics, veggies and dressings.  However, during the lunch rush it feels more like a pack of wolves on a 3 legged cat trying to push through the line. I'm a little ashamed to admit I've almost thrown elbows to go for the last little bit of bacon in the bottom of the bowl on occasion.  Once you stuff yourself with greens you can help yourself to a FREE ice cream cone on the way out the door. Yes, FREE! The ice cream cone puts Jason's near the top of my lunch list!

I don't go to Red Robin very often, but for a chain restaurant it's pretty good.  We sat in the bar for lunch. It wasn't too loud, the area was very clean and our server was very kind. We asked to get the bottomless fries ahead of our food so we could have something to munch on.  The fries and our food came out promptly. I got a burger and the hubbs got the fish and chips. My burger was pretty big and I ate all of it... even though I probably shouldn't have because I was stuffed afterwards! The bun got a little soggy towards the end, but that probably attributes more to my slow eating. The fish and chips were much better than I expected them to be... I think I will actually get those next time!  Red Robin! Yummmmmm

For those of you who have never been to Catch 22, their macaroni and cheese is a gift to mankind.   You can come here to watch the games, or for the Tuesday and Thursday night trivia, but really, you should be coming here for the Mac N Cheese.  It's cheesy, gooey, and delicious. It comes with mushrooms and bacon (those are in my top 10 favorite foods) and a side of garlic toast. YUM. I'm pretty sure our waitress caught me licking the plate... twice  They have a great happy hour menu and tremendous wings, with a choice of 14 different styles/sauces... and I don't even like wings!  The service is great whether you have a group of 4 or 14, and with a large group everyone will be entertained. There are pool tables and lots of TV's.  Another great reason to love Catch 22? They are involved with local sports and charities!  I know we'll be back, and I will read the entire menu so I can "try something new", but who am I kidding? I will be ordering the Mac N Cheese :)

If I had one meal left on this earth; I would come here. This is our fancy go-to spot for special occasions (anniversaries/birthdays) and we order the exact same food every time.  Let me break it down for you.  Always start with a martini. The martini's here are like Nectar of the Gods. And once you finish one martini, make sure you have another (and contemplate a driver to take you home).  If you're a raw oyster fan, don't let the MKT price scare you, these little babies are worth their weight in gold.  The cocktail sauce is the bomb, literally, use a whole spoon full of the horseradish and your mouth will be on fire. If you get heartburn later; it's totally worth it.   You don't need to look at the menu, just order the 12 oz. filet. Don't wimp out by ordering the 6 oz. When that sizzling hot plate of steak is presented, you can almost hear a choir of angels singing. I'm serious... listen for it.  This steak is so juicy and tender you could use a spork to eat it. Everytime I take a bite my husband looks at me like I'm crazy because there is a very audible MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmm.   When it comes to sides I only have 3 words.  Lobster. Mashed. Potatoes. I could literally dive into these and swim in the butter. When the waiter asks to spoon some onto my plate my only response is "Oh, hell yea"... while I try to keep the drooling to a minimum.   Don't forget your veggies! No steak is complete without a heaping side of sautéed mushrooms. Delivered IN THE PAN!   Complete your well rounded meal with a serving of butter cake. Seriously, like melt in your mouth sweetness of butter, brown sugar and everything else delicious that you could ever think of in a dessert. Bonus... it's served with an entire plate of whipped cream.  (I'm starting to drool again)  The wait staff always deserves 6 out of 5 starts. They go above and beyond the call of duty.  At this point you're so full you can't breathe and may require assistance (or a wheelbarrow) to get to your car, and your server may just be kind enough to help you with that too!

I love this location!  Not that I don't love every In-N-Out location!  The burger, shakes and fries never disappoint. The service is always with a smile; just going through the drive-through puts me in a better mood.  And I LOVE when there is a person standing outside to take my order instead of screaming into a microphone in a box. Yay!

We had never heard of Yen Sushi before some family members took us here for happy hour one evening.  Wow, what a hidden gem we were missing out on!    We probably ordered enough food for 10 people... and the 4 of us ate it all. It was all amazing. The presentation of the food really stood out to me. The Calamari Roll (my absolute favorite) even comes with a few fried calamari on the side! What a deal!   Inside it feels cozy and welcoming, and the staff was all extremely friendly.  I have a feeling Yen Sushi is going to become a regular place for us!

My husband and I have been eating at La Bocca for years. The food is incredible and that is the reason we keep coming back. I believe this place has really stepped it up in the service department.  We have had horrible service consistently but our most recent visit prompted me to write this review. Our servers name was Mckinley and he went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful dining experience. We will be requesting him as our server from now on.

For the price you can't beat it!  I hate spending upwards of $20.00 at a fancy car wash just to get in my vehicle and go "Ugh, they missed here, they didn't wipe down there... blah blah blah". For $5.00 I can get the exterior of my car washed and then vaccumm out the inside myself. Which makes me happy because then it is up to my vaccuuming standards!

I absolutely love these hiking trails.  If you're like me, I have a hard time getting motivated to exercise, but I love it here.  (It definitely helps that I can walk to any of the trails from my house.)  There are quite a few options and different difficulty levels.  During the cooler months the mountains will be full of people (Watch out for January 1st; everyone and their mother is there). The summer months can still be busy considering how hot it is. You just have to pick the trails that offer some shade, and when the sun isn't blasting you it makes for an enjoyable hike.  The parking isn't terrible, but I still prefer to walk to any of the trails. As always be careful when hiking, some of the trails will get a little slick after the rains.  I know I will continue to hike here as long as I can!

Don't let the look of this place fool you.   There are a few locations around the valley and they are all equally amazing.  Everything I have tried here completely knocks my socks off.  A few of my favorites include... The Red Curry, The Pan Fried Noodles (Gai Kua), and The Satay.   Dining in our taking out, they have some great lunch specials, and if you're in a hurry call ahead and pick up.  They always amaze me with how fast they can prepare the food!  The portions are large so left overs are pretty much a guarantee.   If you happen upon this place give it a chance, you won't be disappointed!

You will find me here almost every Monday during football season.  The happy hour menu can't be beat. I always order the onion rings and the nachos. For the price it's a steal! The nacho plate is HUGE and can easily be split between 2 people.   There are plenty of TV's and it's never too busy that you can't find a table to sit at in the bar.  The staff is always friendly and personable (it may help that I'm there every week).   Thank you Dillon's for always being my "go-to" bar!

When paying over $250.00 for a hotel room, I expect the sheets to feel more like soft cotton and not horrible sand paper. Our bed also seemed to have some sort of rubber/plastic sheet underneath... Not sure if there was a toddler sleeping in our bed the night before?   The towels were so rough I felt like I was drying my body off with a dried out animal hide. I consider these conditions unacceptable for a reputable establishment. I would never recommend staying in the hotel rooms after trying to sleep on that bed.   The only reason I give this place 2 stars was because the establishment seemed clean. Thank goodness for that.

My mother and I work very close to this Subway and are frequent customers. After my experience today I do not believe I will be going back to this location. When we entered the restaurant the man behind the counter was very cheerful and welcoming. My mother and I were the only customers in there and as I was deciding what to order 2 younger girls double parked in the very first parking spaces and walked in. Assuming they were customers I politely moved out of the way to let them go ahead of me. They were very loud and one of the girls actually ran right into me (not lightly I might add). With no apology or even acknowledgment that I was there she kept walking and entered the employee area. The other girl who had entered with her remained on the customer side of the restaurant. I continued to order my food, and had to keep repeating my order louder and louder because the girl who had plowed into me was so obnoxiously deafening. Then the obnoxious girl (who was completely ignoring my order) started serving her friend she had entered with. RUDE! This employee is a horrible representation of customer service!

Talk about "doing it with style"! iPic provides everything you could possibly need for a date night.   Walking into the theatre and knowing where my seats are makes life much easier... No fighting off people and running up the steps to get the last 2 seats together.   I'm pretty sure the chairs are more comfortable than my recliner at home; plus they come with your own pillow and neatly wrapped blanket to snuggle into.  The popcorn is served to you no questions asked and c'mon the drinks and food are divine! (Trust me - try the flatbread) I really love the fact that they incorporate local ingredients into their food as well.   Bargain hunters pay attention! Becoming a member is definitely worth it... Tuesday's become discount night, and if you make it in for happy hour they have $2.00 beers and $5.00 wine!   Don't feel like seeing a movie? Come in to watch football and the same happy hour applies with discounted wings!

We were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was!  Every time we have tried to come here there is a serious wait to get in. I would suggest making reservations. We finally decided to stick it out and wait because Popo's is so close to our house and we needed a good Mexican restaurant!  I'm so glad we did! My husband inhaled the chips and salsa; our poor waiter had to bring chip refills about 5 times. They were delicious! I ordered the combo plate with the Green Chicken Enchilada and Chicken Taco (with rice and beans). So much food for such a great price! And all so good! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I can't wait to go back and try something new... or I might have to order the same thing because it was amazing   We left with happy bellies and a happy wallet!

A friend of the family recommended this place so we decided to check it out.   When the 7 of us arrived the restaurant was almost entirely full (it's not very large in there; I would suggest making reservations for larger groups). They apologized and said they didn't have the space and there would be a wait.  Luckily, a table had just stood up to leave and they were able to push a couple tables together to accommodate us.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered five different kinds of pizza. Three of which I tried; "The Scientist", "Geppetto" and "Wood Roasted Mushroom". By far the Geppetto was my favorite. I also enjoyed the large fresh mushrooms on the Wood Roasted Mushroom Pizza. The crust was a little too burnt for my taste (I pulled the crust off to get ready for swim suit season anyway!) but otherwise the pizza was delicious. We had assumed we would take some left overs home but it was so good we ate everything that came of out their wood fire (which you can see from almost anywhere in the restaurant).  Overall it was very good and I think I will go back with just my husband to have an easy date night!

We used CC's Sweet Sensations for our wedding and grooms cake. WOW! 5 stars all around! Very professional, and great customer service. We did a cake tasting in their bakery and all of the samples were delicious. We had a hard time picking which flavors to choose.  We were so impressed with CC's that we hired them to do a chocolate fountain at our wedding as well. Their prices are unbeatable for the level of service you receive! I will recommend them to every bride I know!

I LOVE MY DENTIST! My husband and I both use West Valley Family Dental and love it! They have the friendliest staff that generally cares about your wellbeing. They offer teeth whitening at great prices and I love that they are open later so you can come in after work. Looking forward to coming here for many more years!

My mother recommended we go here for lunch one day... and I was pretty annoyed that we passed an In-N-Out to get here.  We walked in and the place was busy! The line moved fast and the service was extremely friendly. I couldn't believe the great prices and the side options. I went for the Mushroom Swiss Char and the Onion Rings with in-house made Ranch Dressing.   As soon as I sank my teeth into that burger I instantly forgot about In-N-Out. Great flavor, and the mushrooms were overflowing out the sides! YUM! The Onion Rings came out super-hot and were fresh and crunchy. The ranch dressing was pretty tasty too!   Next time I really want to try the Tempura Green Beans. Glad we have a great new burger place in the neighborhood!

My husband and I live on 55th avenue and Happy Valley. We used to drive all the way to the location on Via Linda just to eat here. I'm so excited they opened the new location in Deer Valley.  We frequently eat here and the food never disappoints. The prices are great for the quality and quantity of food. The calamari appetizer is one of our favorites.  We won't eat anywhere else when it comes to Asian food. We are definitely lifelong customers.

I love this place! The staff is always smiling and friendly (and they don't give you "the look" when you ask for "a little more mushrooms please?")  It probably helps that I'm picking out every single item for my personalized taste, but I always have a pleasant experience here! The fact that they serve beer and wine always a thumbs up too :)

These "build your own pizza" places are becoming some of my favorite places to go.  The space is small but laid out well and I enjoy the large patio seating they have. It gets pretty busy but the line moves quickly.    Make sure you read the menu, there are a few basic options for a cheaper price, or you can go for the make your own, load on as many toppings as you want awesome feast.   The ingredients tasted fresh and I really like the option of the wheat crust! I felt the sauce could have been a little more prominent, but overall a good pie!

Hooray for an organized used kids store!!! Finally!!!   Once Upon A Child... you understand me. I do not have time to plow through a jungle of toys and crap laying all over the floor. I have a screaming child in my arms!!!  This place is so organized and clean, I could kiss whoever accomplished this. The selection really is superb. I hate looking through used clothes covered in stains. Half the clothes I've found here still have the tags on them. WHAT A BARGAIN!!!!   I now come here for all my kid clothes/toy needs. I feel like I'm buying new off the shelf but don't have to pay the ridiculous prices.

I can't wait to go back here!  When we arrived there was a wait to get in, and I can understand why. The food is amazing! The décor is minimal but colorful. The place is a little loud, which I actually thought made it more fun.  The menu is large and everything looks delicious. I ended up ordering the Camelback Panini with broccoli cheese soup. WOW, the soup was heavenly and the Panini was grilled to perfection. I also go to sample an omelet, a pancake, a side of sausage and eggs benedict. Every bite was better than the last.  I plan on dining here as often as possible to try as much as the menu has to offer!

By far one of the best burgers in the area! I love that fact that Burger N Fries is all about natural food!!!  The prices are insanely low for the quality. The Mushroom Swiss is my absolute favorite burger and I can never decide between the Onion Rings and the French Friends because they are both divine!  The burgers aren't ginormous but are extremely filling. The side portions are very large and can easily be split between 2 people.   Seating is abundant and the outside patio is perfect in the cooler months. Burger N Fries is 5 stars all around in my book!

I take my Mexican food very seriously... and seriously, this is better than Chipotle.  IT'S. THAT. GOOD.  Oh heavenly burritos, I can hear you calling my name. Not sure what drugs they put in their sauce, but I'm addicted to it (Chipotle/cream/sauce? I don't care, its AMAZING). All the portions are large and filling, the people behind the counter are always helpful, and the place is clean.   The salsa bar provides a wide variety of flavors and spices. The menu has something for everyone, everything I have ordered has always been delicious.  Senor Taco, thank you for making my taste buds do a happy dance every time!

I am immediately falling in love with this place. I've attended 2 Prenatal Yoga classes and I'm completely hooked!  The classes are a great price compared to other prenatal yoga studios around town, and they offer Mommy and Me classes!  The store is quaint and offers an abundance of baby necessities!   Every single employee I have interacted with has been more than wonderful. I have recommended this studio to all my pregnant and new Mommy friends.  I am looking forward to continuing my yoga during and after my pregnancy with Modern Milk!

I have to update my review because this place has become so much more to me than a yoga studio.  This place is a sanctuary for all mothers. When my 5 week older daughter was having multiple problems with nursing and colic I came to see Stephanie (lactation consultant) who diagnosed her with a tongue tie. Stephanie provided multiple solutions and a pediatrician capable of providing the procedure to correct the tongue tie.  Since having the procedure, our daughter is a completely different baby, so much happier and not in pain.  I'm so thankful to have Modern Milk to bond with other Mothers and learn and grow with all our babies together.
