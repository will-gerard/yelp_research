So, I'd like to consider myself well versed in take-out Chinese food. I've tried so many places but I usually am pretty picky so I only stick to about two things: orange chicken and/or sweet an sour chicken(basic). When I try a new place, I have high hopes to get my socks blown off. Of course I always get a side of crab puffs because it's a must with Chinese. Anyway. Most places' orange chicken dishes don't ever surpass tasting like Panda Express (eek) and their sweet and sour chicken is typically super breaded with a pinch of chicken. And flavorless without sauce. Well let me tell you.....my socks have been blown!! Here the chicken was lightly breaded, and SEASONED. The crab puffs weren't fried to death, they were fried to perfection and not oily at all. Everything was superb. The lady that took my order over the phone was very sweet. She quoted me 45min for delivery and the guy got to me in 15-20. I think I have found my new favorite take out spot!

I could not catch a break for nail salons on Thursday 2/27/14. I went in here after a horrible experience with service at the My Nail Spa across the street. The service was great in the fact that they were all pretty pleasant. BUT I got a polish change and it literally looks like a 10yr old painted them. They're very lumpy and blotchy. I explained this to the tech that did them and she immediately told me they're fine. After sitting under the dryer a bit I told her again, yeah no they don't look good to me. And she said that it was because they were still wet....now I'm no nail tech, but I've been getting my nails done for YEARS and hearing that they look like crap because they're  wet was news to me. Mind you, it's now Friday and I'm certain they're dry and guess what? They still look like poo. I'm torn between going back and asking them to fix them, or just going to my normal spot and never trying out somewhere new. I'm sure they either won't fix them or they will talk about me the entire time. -.-

I have tried MANY Chinese take out places. And have yet to find one whom comes close to "NY style" until today. I order the shrimp lo mein and crab ragoons for delivery. The guy that took my order was a little stuffy at first and almost put me off ordering. But he turned out to be pretty helpful when i needed an opinion in portion size. Anyway, he quoted me 30 mins and the delivery guy was almost right on the dot! Now, the food.   Let's just say. I have always ordered crab ragoons and they are typically very basic. But I always order them just kind of out of habit. I just started assuming they all tasted like Panda Express ragoons. But holy cow. These ragoons were AMAZING! I had to stop myself from eating the whole bag of 8 in one sitting. And the shrimp lo mein? Cooked to flippin perfection! Usually I expect to have over cooked shrimp, but no it was literally perfect. And the price was very reasonable. I'm so glad I decided to give them a shot instead of going with the other place that's really close to me that has Panda Express-ish food. I will GLADLY order from here again!

I wish I could give this place a negative star rating. I walked in to get a polish change and to have one nail fixed as it had a tiny crack in it. I was told that I actually would need a fill because of the crack (not true) and that I could only get a gel fill. As the woman was talking all the employees that has nothing better to do came up. And said some crap in their language. I then told the woman politely never mind and left. After I got in my car I told myself, just get it done because I'm already here. Literally took me two minutes to go back into the place and the woman that I was initially talking to was outside on the phone and came up to me before I could walk back into the door and said we can't help you now. We have appointments.....! Are you kidding. Appointments with whom? All the crickets in there? Uhg I didn't even argue, just laughed and left. NEVER coming back here even if you paid me.

I thought this place was very good and considering we WERE going to go to the Persian Room, that's saying allot! There was only one waiter for the place and he was not the most pleasant, but he was quick responsive. Just wish he would have written the cost of the sodas on the tab. Nit-picking aside, this place was great, my boyfriend and i shared a combo plate and were both pretty full afterward. I would definitely go back.

Did not even get to place an order for delivery which they so proudly boast about. Due to them not having a driver up til later in the evening. How do you offer delivery but not have enough drivers???

We had the steak shish kabob and jofi rice. They dishes were really good and full a flavor! I was a little worried at first as we were the only people in the restaurant for a while. But it tries our to be a nice experience. The waitress was nice, and attentive. Not very talkative which is good and bad. If come back with another groupon.

So we came to this place because there were good reviews (3). But upon arrival we noticed the name was not Zaytoon but Greek Place & Fry. After some debate about that. We went in. It was clean. Only one guy that was incidentally the cashier and the cook. The service was fast considering there were only a couple other people trickling in. Now the food.......I ordered the lamb kabob. The only reason I wanted to come here mind you. And I could swear was beef. But the guy insisted that it was in fact what I ordered and paid extra for. Whatever. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and steak kabobs. Both meals very lemony and VERY tough/chewy. My bf looked like he was trying to bite through a shoe the way he was trying to tear apart the pieces. I was going to tell the guy, but I've come to the realization that complaining to them gets you no where. So I may as well try to inform the unsuspecting public! Long story short we won't be coming back here.

This is our second time at this location and the food has been bad both times. The service was nice. But the chicken sandwiches were SUPER dry. It's kind of amazing how a chicken place always has dry chicken. Time for a new location.

I have had some CRAZY experiences with nail salons lately in my search to find a new i. And by crazy I mean bad -.- so im always a little nervous when I go into a new place. But WOW! Jackie did my fill and she did such an amazing job. Everyone in the whole salon was really nice and didn't mind having conversation. So I think, I have finally found my new nail spot. I need a full set next, sooooo we'll see if the work is consistent. I'll update.

So when my boyfriend suggested this place for carry out tonight, I was a bit skeptical. Up to this point I hadn't had the best experiences with Chicago style pizza. The crust is always soggy and or it ends up having 0 flavor. But, he insisted and we picked up a sausage and pepperoni pie. I'm thinking, okay....It is undoubtedly going to be soggy because we have to drive about 10mins to get it to the house. Boy was I wrong!! The pizza turned out to be AMAZING. THE sauce was wonderfully seasoned and the crust? Crunchy and delicious. I would definitely drive back out to the sticks for some more of this crunchy, gooey goodness!!

Amazing food! The loaded tots are to die for. It's cool if you wanna go and watch a game or fight. TVS are literally covering every square inch of the walls. It is pretty loud in there, at least when we went. I know, i know its a sports bar. But it was super loud even with that considered. My bf and I had to yell to hear each other because the TVs were epically loud. Other than that though, the place was tasty and fun!

The service was fantastic and so was the food! We arrived 1 minute before they were supposed to be closing until dinner. We hadn't realized that they closed and then re-opened. Otherwise we wouldn't have shown up (we aren't THAT big of jerks :) ) But the nice woman waitress let us in and gave us superb service just as if we hadn't come in before closing (you know how some restaurants treat you around closing time) Reasonably priced, delicious food, and wonderful service. I would totally recommend them! Just note. They close from 3-5 on Saturdays.
