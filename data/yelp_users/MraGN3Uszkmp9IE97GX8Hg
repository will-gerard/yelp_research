Story of a Wood Fired Chicken  Once upon a warm, sunny March day, two ravenous monkeys entered the Jungle of Pita. The two monkeys were under the impression that this jungle only offered pita dishes, a notion that quickly proved to be a myth as each monkey ordered a wrap of sorts. As the two monkeys chowed down on their mediocre wraps, each caught a glimpse of a most uplifting . . . chicken. Yes, a chicken. A wonderfully massive Wood Fired Chicken, mounted upon a bed of mashed potatoes, floating by to another monkey's tree. Mouths sputtering water, the monkeys finished their meal and agreed to help themselves to this chicken next time.  Once upon another warm, sunny March day, the same two ravenous monkeys entered the Jungle of Pita and each ordered a fine-looking Wood Fired Chicken. Anticipation knocked on their trees as they waited. Finally, the chicken arrived. The monkeys ravaged each bite of their outstanding meal, which contained a blend of seasoned spinach, mashed potatoes, and juicy chicken - all soaked in a citrusy tomato sauce. Oh glorious day, that day they reveled in the glorious Wood Fired Chicken. Even though the portion was huge, each monkey licked their plate clean and swore they would return again for the Wood Fired Chicken, because that's where it's at in the Jungle of Pita.

Meh. This place needs love. Why did I let myself be swayed by the 4-star average? Why did I encourage my colleagues to join me in eating here? There was nowhere to sit comfortably. The "best seat in the house" is located next to a disturbingly noisy TV and radio. The Pad Thai is fine, except the chicken cleared my appetite. It had this gamey taste. I kept trying to disguise the flavor by continuously squeezing lime over the dish. You know, the people who work here seem very nice, and for their sake I hope they step it up a big fat notch. Noodle & Rice, it's time for an extreme makeover.

Meat Lover's Flat Bread: Juicy taste to be fed Like a fix from a med Satisfies my redhead.  Big-bite Waffle Fries: Side order I advise Getting it would be wise Top-notch fries? It complies.   Seasoned Shrimp Flat Bread: Burnt edges make it dead Lack of flavor that I dread Get the Lamb Chops instead.  Fat Burger is real nice: Seasoned well with lots of spice I would eat it trice times trice Def...a culinary vice.  Service is really slow: Inattention has to go Staff's distracted, you should know Needs to get a better flow.  Lamb Chops are the best: Chimichurri? I'm impressed. Super flavor, I attest. Tender goodness, I'm obsessed.

Welcome to Asian Island, home of some of the best Chinese take-out in Tucson--uh, I mean, home of some of the really good Chinese take-out in Phoenix. For SEVEN MONTHS, I have been deprived of fan-worthy Chinese food. Good grief. T-Town should come with a disclaimer: "The city of Tucson lacks 4 and 5-star Chinese restaurants." I've been hunting around for a while now, and then on my first attempt at Chinese in Phoenix, I experience a victory of sorts.  For Americanized Chinese food, this place is good. They have $8 dinner combos with a super-portioned dish, a spring roll, and two crab cakes.   I especially appreciate Asian Island's transparent kitchen wall, which allows guests to peek in while the cooks do their thang. So get on in there and watch how they fry all their shtuff.

Me: How long have you guys been open? Bartender: About... four hours.  Do you know how cool it is to go to a music venue on opening night? Very, very, cool. Why? Because everything is new. EVERYONE is new: guests, bartenders, bouncers and all. And the regulars? They don't exist yet.  Last night, I had the distinct pleasure of attending the Blind Pilot concert for Crescent Ballroom's opening night. The opener, Dan Mangan, can forever take pride in being the first band to play on their stage. Lucky dudes.  The venue itself has a neat layout. They have an outdoor patio with huge operable windows that open up into a hang out bar with comfy booths and tables. Just past this room, they have the main performance space, which has three levels of viewing: 1- for up close and personal: on-floor standing directly in front of the stage or seating off to the left 2- for non-dancers or folks who are tired of standing: bleacher seating at the back wall 3- for luxury drinking: on-floor tables or at-the-bar seating inside the performance space  The bartenders are kick ass and thoughtful. Kick ass because they provide quick and friendly service. Thoughtful because they provided me with a super tasty drink on the fly. It went like this...  Me: "What's your most citrusy drink?" Bartender: "Hm, I could do a citrusy rum or vodka." Me: "You decide." Bartender: "How about a fresh squeezed mango lemon drop, on the rocks?"  Citrus perfection.  The surreal-in-a-good-way lighting may or may not make you feel like you are traveling through time, just saying. The sound is pretty good. I like that the speakers hang from the ceiling. And when you're bladder needs a little break, check out the spotless bathrooms (or hopefully still spotless, since it was opening night and all).  To end the night, Blind Pilot performed their final song, "3 Rounds and a Sound," on the floor, unplugged, because "it's just that kind of venue." Such an intimate and cozy place. Do visit, especially since they have some good bands coming through soon. In fact, I will already be back next week to see the Blitzen Trapper and Dawes concert.

(conveyor belt of sushi rolling by)  LAS VEGAS ROLL:  Check. Me. Out. Baby. I'm tantalizing. I've got some BBQ eel, masago for real, and a cream cheese seal. Deep fried, hun. Find me on a purple plate. And. Don't be intimidated by my crab stick's weight. Pick, me, up, for my three dolla rate.  (more sushi rolling by)  TATUM ROLL:  Ooooh. Pick me! Pick me! I'm kinda sorta spicy. Try me and you will see. Crawfish. Crabstick. Avoca-DOH. I'm really super artsy. I'm really super pretty. I'm really super tasty. Try me if you're gutsy.  CATERPILLAR ROLL:  Fresh green, fresh green. I'm pretty much the queen. My sliced avocado is the best I've ever seen. Cute sauce, cute sauce. With colors like a boss. If you don't get me, it will be your loss.  (wasabi kicking in)  WASABI:  I. Am. Strong. I'll give you a high. A tingle in your nose then a tear in your eye. Sinuses, goodbye. By the end of your meal, I will hear you sigh.  (small bowls of ice cream appear)  ICE CREAM:  Heeeeey. Did someone my name? Say you saw I'm free and no charge you'll be to blame. Just be sure to eat me with no shame.  (check rolls in)  CHECK:  Best part is, that this new biz, is cheap for it's wiz. Eight dollars, Ms.
