Surprise for a city of 100,000 people has a lack of good restaurants.  Most of the decent ones are chain restaurants that are predictable but nothing great.  Chen Wok is an exception to the rule.  I have yet to be disappointed by a meal from them, whether it is dine-in or take-out.  The owner and his wife are usually there and greet customers like family.  Repeat customers will find that they are remembered.  If one has ordered the same thing twice, they can usually repeat the order from memory.  They do not own a steam table; every dish is cooked to order.  They are more than willing to make adjustments to fit your personal preferences.  I am a vegan; they will even leave out the egg in their soups so I can eat them.  I also love spicy food; I order the Ma-Po Bean Curd extra extra spicy (actually the way to word it is, "As Hot As Possible.") and have never been disappointed.  My wife orders Teriyaki Chicken but has a sensitive stomach, so they accommodate her by going light on the sauce.  Their menu is varied enough that my kids can order whatever strikes their fancy at the time.  Some of the pervious reviewers disparage Chen Wok for being small with "Costco Tables."  If one wants atmosphere, then go to P. F. Chang's and pay triple for half the food.  Chen Wok is fine example of the small independent American business.  They deserve your support and patronage a hell of a lot more than the McDiarrhea's in the parking lot.  I gave them 5 stars because of value and quality and taste.  I can live without the pretentious of atmosphere.

I have eaten here off and on over the years always with enough time elapsed that I forgot why I didn't return.  This time I know fully why I won't.  There is no vegetarian/vegan option among the spring rolls, STRIKE ONE.  Most of the entrees are made to order, so substitution of tofu for the meat takes care of vegan concerns.  I stressed I want the dish to be spicy hot 12 on scale 10, in other words Thai spicy.  Too many Sun City customers have made them timid, at best the dish was about a 7. STRIKE TWO. I asked for their spice rack/tray, I believe they needed to get it out of moth balls. Spice added after the fact is never as flavorful as spice added during cooking, STRIKE THREE.  Now with this posted, I knew why I don't return.

I have been going to Paradise for years, before becoming vegan and after.  We go at least once a week.  I enjoy the fact that unlike other Mongolian BBQ places, I can fully spice my stir-fry with all the hot spicy sauce I want prior/during cooking.  The other places don't want to go through the extra work to clean the grill for the next guest, at Paradise it is just done without complaint or comment.  Before cooking my stir-fry, the cooks know to clean the grill so no meat residue is left.  Now that I am a vegan, they know that for my first serving of stir-fry I need Tofu for my protein.  My one complaint, which is minor, is the extra $1.25 for the Tofu, when I'm not consuming anything with meat, either in the stir fry or from the buffet.  The selection of vegetables and meats are always fresh and appetizing.  My kids love making their own combinations.  They know my rule for them is, "Take all you want, but eat ALL you take."  My other complaint is about my fellow customers who have never quite grasped this concept, if they have heard about it in the first place.  Wasting food because you can will drive prices up for everyone.

I have never had any food here that wasn't a least very good and usually extra good.  This is Arizonan/Sonoran Mexican food at its best.  This is at both the old location and this seen and accessible location.  This new location is more user friendly and I don't feel like I'm in a speakeasy.  I saw a review where it was said everything here was just a variation on beef & chicken. well that is plain wrong.  The pork chili verde is the best in the northwest valley.  The menudo is rich and hearty.  The cheese crisps are great.  This is the only restaurant that offers fresh jalapeno or serrano chilies, not that canned or pickled junk.

The food has stayed consistently excellent.  Came in to have a holiday meal with my daughter and was greatly satisfied.
