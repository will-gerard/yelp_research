Rokerij has amazing food whether for breakfast, dinner or happy hour! I'm a fan of their brunch which is served on sizzling metal plates to ensure your food is hot and fresh. The only bad thing is their prices can be a little spendy  and I hate having to valet for breakfast! Try their crab tostadas or steak toasts, amazing!!

One of the few Chinese places I will frequent. Not only is the food great but the service is great, food comes out quickly as well. Try the tangerine chicken you won't regret it.

Service is decent but the one thing that never fails me is the orange blossom. There is no other hefewiezen that comes close! Hooray for orange blossom beer!

Service is always great and food is consistent. Huge fan of the fez burger or shrimp kisra!! The garlic aioli is out of this world.

For having to go to urgent care the place was enjoyable as possible. Everyone was extremely friendly and nice from the receptionist, m.a. to the doctor. They were able to fill my script on the spot which is a huge benefit!  Unrelated tho their services why in the world are people going to urgent care because of a cough, or congestion. Go see your d.o. to avoid exposure to those injured who need "urgent care".

I love this swanky restaurant. Their staff is friendly and it is conveniently located. My only complaining is that I am not the only one who knows, so there is often a lengthy wait. I am also not a fan of valet parking, but hey- the food is worth it! The food is amazing! I won't lie I crave their perfectly cooked fingerling potatoes with their house made aioli.  If the noise level bothers you request seating outside or on the second floor. Both are perfect areas for small parties!

Super disappointing, they won't take reservations and I wanted to make a reservation for 20 persons. I've been here many many times and love the food and drinks but would definitely not suggest it for large parties. I wouldn't have asked if I didn't think that the mixologists weren't amazing.   Big disappointment! May be back in the future for drinks, but for now I'll take my money elsewhere.

Central Phoenix wouldn't be the same without Obsecura at Rips!

I give Stingray two stars purely for the fact there food is cheap and edible during happy hour.  Service was bad (which seems to be the trend in their reviews) nothing special about their menu and very little to chose from. We were craving toro but they were out. I'd have to say their sushi was worse than RA. I'll most likely never go back unless with a group. Limited selection, poor service, long wait time and over priced drinks.  The end.

Great food! I NEVER eat a hot dog; however, I was pressured to try Short Leash and was not disappointed at all! I was not only able to to select special toppings, but could also select unique meat such as a duck dog, my combination was amazing, I will definitely try another.  Now we just need a cocktail menu!

Great modern fresh Thai food. They have done an awesome job remodeling and decorating the restaurant. I love the Sa Bai fried rice, but everything is good! :) Highly recommended by me.

This place definitely deserves 5 stars! It is conveniently located, open on weekends, and  all of the staff are friendly. I have to be honest I have always been skeptical of chiropractors and was hesitant to go, but had run out of options and my back has been throbbing for days. After going to Urgent Care, icing, pain pills and resting I decided to check it out for myself.   The doctor was kind, sympathetic and gentle with me. The doctor listened to me and did not rush me which I was unable to do. I was so embarrassed from crying from pain but he was professional and kind the whole time. I have not been able to walk in over 3 days from the intense back pain which I learned was from a slip disk. Two hours after coming home from my alignment I am able to sit and walk with much reduced pain. I cannot THANK him enough. Hours later I am already feeling better. I purchased a 1 month pass and will be back next week! I am so grateful for the help and support and will definitely make referrals.

There food was delicious, try the banana french toast with whiskey caramel. It seems as if they are still getting organized, I'd love to try it again in a few weeks. I had to wait for coffee in the coffee line, was told to wait in the brunch line, and then move back over to the coffee line... Overall food was great!
