Every single time I come in, the front desk representatives are always welcoming and nice. However, with every appointment I've made the massage therapists are always late and never make up for the time. Today, I came in and let the therapist named Nancy know I was feeling under the weather with allergies. She gave me a rude look and asked "so you're trying to get me sick?" I told her it was allergies due to the season and she asked, "are you sure it's just allergies?" Right then and there I told her I'll reschedule. I walked out, cancelled my appointment. Will be cancelling my membership with Massage Envy.

Quick and fast service! Quite salty though. You just need to make sure you stock up on the lime at their salsa bar.

Convenient and they open late! Employees had great service. Very polite and apologetic, which you don't see in a lot of fast food places. Plus they gave me a butt load of sauce. You can always appreciate extra sauce.
