I visited the new location on 16th St and Camelback and ordered the carne asada and al Pastor tacos.  The asada was truly tasteless and the lettuce so finely minced it seemed pre-chewed.  The al Pastor was slightly more flavorful when lots of salsa added.  The roasted jalape√±o was served ice cold.  Really terrible experience.

It was my first time here and I am not surprised at how much I love this place.  I sat at the bar and was very well taken care of by Tom who made sure I had everything I could need or want.  The butternut squash ravioli with brown butter, parmesan and crispy fried sage leaves was plate licking good.

What a great time tonight.  Amazing food, flamenco and incredible energy in this place tonight.  Paella was delicious and the entertainment was really special. Looking forward to another evening like this here again soon.
