I've shopped Sunny's for years for my personal  hair extensions & also for my salon. They've always been great at answering questions & making sure I have everything I need. My recent trip I was helped by a employee  (Ericka) who by far was the most helpful ever. She helped me with so much&was very humble & never pushy. Seriously best place in AZ for all hair accessories /extensions/wigs etc....

I love this place. CINDY does ny nails &is soooo sweet&caring.  She takes her time even when busy. I always come in with crazy ideas and she's done them great every single time. I'm a hairstylist so my hands are in water alot,  Cindy makes sure they won't lift because fungus is never fun lol she goes out of her way to make you happy. For instance I broke 2 nails working out so I went in to see Cindy to get them fixed (nail repair is $5 per nail) my nails are  pretty detailed with tons of gems & long , shaped like a coffin, so my repairs aren't that easy. Cindy first off told me to come in cuz I called first&they were closing in 10min. Then she spent 45min fixing the 2 broken ones matching them up perfectly & again covering them with the gems about 20 I'd say. Anyways she said no charge & told me she would see me for my fill. I was blown away so obviously I tipped her the $20 I was expecting to pay ($10 nail repair  $8tip) but her kindness got a $20. I'm in beauty industry & know it's ppl like her that stand out&above the rest. Thankyou Cindy your the best !!!

Got here at 3:40 just finished my car at 443pm little bit of a long wait but I don't mind as long as they do a good job. after bringing my car to cobblestone nearby who completely dinged and scratched my brand new car obviously going anywhere I'm nervous but they did a good job here my car was super dirty because I kept putting off the car wash because I was so nervous and I'm really picky especially about vacuuming I have 3 kids that should tell you why but they did an amazing job and the two guys that clean the car at the dry station really took their time. I bought three supreme car washes off coupon for $33 which is normally the price just for one so it was a great deal I'll be coming back and even after my coupons are up I'll still come back its two minutes away from my house. only thing I can say hopefully they hire more people because if they do that then there's nothing to complain about. And honestly when you go to car wash everybody should check the car before they leave there more than happy to fix whatever needs fixing but if you drive off and then complain then that's your bad.

I have been a loyal customer of Dutch Bros coffee for years and years so when the location on greenfield and southern opened I was so excited because it is literally 1 minute away from my house. I've never been happier with everything about this location.  The employees are so AMAZING AND WELCOMING. The  place is always busy &poppin, you can't help but leave with a smile on your face. And don't be afraid of the long lines,  they always have ppl out there taking orders from your car so when u get up there it's ready for you.  Love this place always have and hoping always will

So I've been here a total of 5 times. .all 4 times were awesome , I got same thing blended taro with boba & glaze donut. The 5th time (today) was HORRIBLE . I ordered an iced Thai tea with boba & glaze donut. The donut was ok, had a weird after taste like kind of sour BUT that could be from the DISGUSTING  Thai tea I could only take 1 drink out of. It was horrible & had a rotten taste to it. I would've gone back but I was in a huge hurry going to work & just figured either I never go back OR never order the Thai tea again!! Also it was a different person today usually a guy always helps me but today it was a woman. Mind you she was big & pregnant so maybe she wad having a off day lol I gave 4 stars for the 4 visits that were good

Found this place on yelp& so glad I did. They welcomed me & even let my son sample jellies before ordering incase he didn't like it. Only thing is I wish they offered a smaller size. They only offer 24oz ....I'll be back definitely. ..we'll just turn my son's drink  into 2 drinks to drink another day ;-)

I just went to the Panda Express on Southern and Stapley to get one of their boba teas it is 1015 in the morning and they are open & like coffee drinkers I like tea in in the morning. I went through the drive thru I placed my order went up to the window and was told none of their Teas are  brewed...... and that's it. They did not tell me how long it would be if I wanted to wait they didn't offer anything and I feel if you're open for business you need to have everything available or make up for it not just tell me sorry no teas are brewed and shut the window. If you're a business and you have open and close hours that means when your open you should have everything available and when you close it means you should close at the time that it says and not 20 minutes early. I am so bummed about this place because this is my third chance I've given it and each time was horrible the time before this one I had to give them my order literally 7 times in a row because she kept deleting it .
