I agree! Best sushi in town! Great place for a birthday dinner.  Let the wait staff know and they will take care of you.

Any of the pizzas are great! I love the bruschetta as an appetizer.  My wife even thinks that the dough may be better than Pizzeria Bianco.

This place knows how to compete with the Pizza big boys.  Next best thing to Pizzeria Bianco.  Fantastic crust, homemade ingredients, just all out great!! Bruschetta is amazing also.  I do recommend lunch though.  Dinner crowds can be very busy and forget about getting a table during an event in Glendale.

Worst customer service ever. Asked for a LARGE cup of ice and was given a medium. Asked again for a large and got some excuse about inventory and not being able to charge for water. Have never had good customer service here and food usually is cold or barely warm. Always disappointed and have given this location many tries to get it right.  Good thing there is a Starbucks very close to this location.  At least there they always give good customer service.

Paid for VIP wash, got very crappy wash. Half a** vacuum job followed by uncleared tires, uneven dash dressing, dust in corners of dash, and couldn't get a manager to respond for 15 minutes. At finishing area was refused a manager. Will not be back here again, ever.

Fat kid food heaven!  Best Philly Cheesesteak I have ever had.  Roll was incredibly soft.  Ice cream shakes are amazing.  Huge selection of ice cream.  Onion rings are amazing.  Only thing bad I can say is the restroom was mediocre clean at best.

After receiving several fliers on my door for Nick from New Image I decided to give them a call to see if they could come in close to where we needed to be for our backyard landscaping.  When I called I made it clear what I was looking for including a budget we needed to be near. I was told this was likely feasible and we scheduled an appointment for Nick to come out and measure our yard.  When he got to our home he proceeded to measure our yard and then asked only a few questions regarding what we wanted. I again mentioned our budget and clarified what we were looking for but also made it clear we were open to suggestions and changes if they helped us get to our budget. Nick left and I felt like he may have understood but honestly wasn't sure given the complete lack of real open interaction. I guess you could say questions were asked by Nick but the answers we gave him drifted in one ear and out the other,  leaving him with a dumbfounded look on his face. I tried to be hopeful that he'd pull through and provide us with quotes we could work with. I was wrong.  When we did receive the renderings back they weren't what we had described to him. Surprise surprise.  I then asked that he provide me with the quote and redo the rendering.  He eventually redid the rendering but never provided an updated quote other than a very generic,  hard to understand,  email of the difference in cost. The real disappointment in this process was the quote being more than double the budget we stated and were told could be close to. When I emailed Nick back to clarify again that we had a budget we thought we discussed Nick rudely replied that I was not the appropriate fit as a client for his business as opposed to actually providing me with a quote that fit in my budget and was near what we wanted. If what we were looking for was that far out of the budget,  why wasn't this communicated with us from the start. I'm obviously more than okay with this now,  given his reply, but find it hard to believe anybody would give a dime to this ignorant and unprofessional kid. The lack of communication and professionalism are something I have never dealt with from other landscape companies and I honestly expect his business to fail miserably if this is how he is going to treat potential clients. Unless you are wanting to be treated like crap I suggest not wasting your time even getting quotes from Nick and New Image landscape.

As the owner I would expect that you knew what your staff did. I did in fact receive a flier or else there is no way I would have called for a quote. Secondly,  unless you were present at our initial meeting than you would have no clue what was said. I clearly stated to Nick on more than one occasion what our budget was and made it clear,  or so I thought,  that we were flexible in this budget if he could get us close. He stated we would discuss areas we could do in phases if needed but that meeting our budget,  and I quote,  "no problem,  I see no reason we can't get close." As a prospective customer I take this as no issue getting to the budget or close to it,  not to be given a quote more than double our discussion and with zero help or further discussion on how to get close to the budget. I'm disgusted that you think you are politely declining to do business with me when zero REAL attempt was made to gain a customer.  What it really boils down to is Nick's inability to listen and focus on customer needs and his lack of desire to be helpful.  I made it clear from the beginning and still had to go back and request that he fix the rendering to reflect what I initially asked for but I bet you won't include those emails. You are far from the only landscape company in the valley and I could not be more happy with the way it ended because I can only imagine the hoops I would have had to jump through to get a job completed had I chosen to become your customers. PS- you may want to make sure New Image isn't really leaving fliers on doors without your knowledge.  Also,  don't you find it odd that nearly all of the concerns on Yelp involve Nick in some way?
