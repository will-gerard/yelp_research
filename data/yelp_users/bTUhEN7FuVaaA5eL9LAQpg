Modern with a country flare, San Tan Flat is a fun place to chill with close friends, roast marshmallows with the family or dance the night away with live tunes.  There are 3 bars, a room with some pool tables and a restaurant where you must try the filet.

Quite, comfortable atmosphere with a very friendly staff. Great place to get my creative work in when a change of scenery is needed. Bonus is both a front and back patio (for those non-summer days). Not a huge fan of the coffee, but overall a great experience. I'll be back.

Two stars only because the staff was friendly. My advice, do all you can to avoid Dr Frank Raia. Worst set of experiences I've had in the medical arena, and I've had a lot.   He denied getting records that were verified by more than one other office, and told me he could make recommendations because he didn't have the info. He didn't evaluate me instead spent 20-30 seconds evaluating me.   When he sent me for two tests and one was canceled, he said a follow up wasn't necessary. He is extremely inefficient and has absolutely no regard for his patients. I had to continue seeing him based on a recommendation from my lawyer for a personal injury case, otherwise I'd never have gone back. I could go on with more specifics, but I'll spare you. Take my advice an GO ELSEWHERE!
