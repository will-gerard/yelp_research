Excellent service! Hour and a half is the way to go! Ask for Rob. He always listens to my needs and gives me the massage suited for my situation.

Ice was choppy even after zamboni. No attendant on ice to referee reckless skaters or monitor bad falls. Kids coming out on ice in their tennis shoes. No rubber mats out, so if you brought your own skates you'd mess up the skating edge by walking on concrete. Employees seemed to be more into visiting with regulars. Session started 15 minutes late. I miss the ice rink at Metrocenter!

Everything was going great until they had the nerve to charge me for mayonnaise to put on my sandwich. My family of 5 will not be returning.

First year to get season passes for the family. Money well spent! If I had one complaint it would be the waves are too far apart.

Burgers are tastey! Don't bother with the Smash Fries. The concept is nice, but tossing something that's already been fried in olive oil is to much!

People from Chicago love this place! I am not from Chicago. I've tried a few things here since the restaurant opened. The Italian beef, imo, wasn't worth all the hype or wait. Hot dog was tasty, but how can you screw up a hot dog other than putting ketchup on it! This restaurant should be ashamed of itself for allowing their canned disgusting tamales to be served here, especially in AZ. Too crowded. Too pricey. Plenty of better restaurants in the area.

This place was delicious and different! Has vegan and vegetarian choices.  Loved the many different salsas from the salsa bar. Laid back atmosphere.  Friendly staff. Will definitely return!
