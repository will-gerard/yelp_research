Had a great day at the Zoo today!  I hadn't been there for a while and we decided to just go.  Weather was perfect (mid 70's) and it was during the middle of the week.  There were a few schools there on field trips but other than that, not many people which was great!  In all my years of going to the Zoo this is my first experience where all of the animals were out and about.  It was really great.

Great Service!!!  I needed some items printed for a baby shower so I emailed a pdf file to them.  When I arrived with my card stock they had my email opened and promptly printed the items while I shopped in the store for a few more things.  Printing was perfect and fast.  The customer service clerk Tina was so gracious on the phone and in person.  Thank You for making this very easy for me.

Seriously Danny's. I just left, you washed my car just fine but why in the world can you not open the back hatch and vacuum!  This is the second time it's happened. Shame on me for going back. I will be calling management to complain as well. This is crazy that you have to inspect everything before you leave.  I'd rather go to Francis and Sons on 7th St even though it takes twice as long. As least I know everything will be cleaned

As usual, Rokerij doesn't disappoint.  We had a party of 7 and sat in the cellar in one of the booths which fit us well.  We had a vegetarian in our group and with mostly meat and fish dishes served we were a little worried she wouldn't find much to suit her tastes. Steven our server was great and pointed out so many options to her. She left full, satisfied and can't wait to go back for more. Others in our group had Lamb, Pork and SeaBass.  As usual it was delicious and did not dissapoint!  The servings are large so expect you may go home with a to-go box.  Wine list is great but if you prefer a cocktail they really know how to make them. We love the Rokerij and will visit the cellar again as well as Richardsons patio once this summer heat goes away. Keep up the good work Rokerij.

Love this airport. It may not be the largest international airport but it sure does have a great selection of restaurants (inside and outside of security) and it is very easy to navigate.

Only had pie and the slices were amazing. The food looked and smelled pretty good too. They were super busy with a 50 minute wait. We got lucky and found two seats at the counter.  Service was good considering how busy they were.

Stopped by here yesterday for a fast lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the quick and friendly service and quality of food. We sat upstairs in the bar and I believe our servers name was Josh. I love Sangria and Kona makes theirs with Sake. I'm not a fan of Sake but this was really yummy!   We had the potstickers for an appetizer, my daughter had a sushi roll and I ordered the fish tacos with fried rice. The only hiccup to the whole meal was that the fried rice had cooked pineapple in it and I'm allergic to that. But, this was my mistake because I didn't read the description. Josh was very professional about it when I called him over to our table, taking it back to the kitchen and having them make it again without the pineapple.  So many things in the menu sound really good so I'll be back for sure!

Stopped in on a Wednesday morning for breakfast since we were guests in the Monte Carlo hotel.  We were seated instantly and there were only two other tables that were occupied in our section.  After being seated, we were never acknowledge or greeted by our server for about 10 minutes even though she and her assistant saw us. Not even offered a cup of coffee or water which I thought was very unusual for a coffee shop/cafe restaurant inside of a large hotel/casino.  Our server finally came over and took our order which was a typical and simple breakfast order.  We waited and waited for our food all while our server came by a couple times to tell us it was almost done and to refill our coffee.  A runner finally brought our meal out and mine was wrong so he took it back to be corrected and returned it very fast.   The food was good but it was ice cold and after waiting so long for it there was no way I was going to send it back.  By now, our section had started to fill up and I noticed how fast other orders were being taken and food being served.  All I can say was that it was like the minute we sat down we were totally invisible to our server and everyone else that worked there.  Again, the food was good (but cold) but the real problem here was the service. It was horrible and I won't be finding myself back in this restaurant if we return to the Monte Carlo again.   I also felt that it was a little on the expensive side for what you got.  Two typical eggs and meat meals, a side of oatmeal with coffee and with tip our bill was about $50.

Decided to go there last night so I went online to place our to-go order.  Soon discovered that you cannot order certain things online even though they are offered on the menu therefore I just called the restaurant and placed the order, to be picked up at 5:50pm.  The girl that took my order explained that they were still working through the online system and hopefully you will be able to order everything soon.  She read my order back to me and it was correct.  I arrived at 5:50 to pick up our order and the young man read everything back to me again, just as I had ordered it.  He told me that it would take about 5-10 minutes to put my order together.  Ok, I'm assuming they don't prepare the dishes until you arrive so that it will be nice and fresh.  I'm fine with that. About that same amount of time passed and they showed up with my bag of food.  As I was preparing to walk out the door, a server stopped me to tell me that we were missing our 6 rolls that had been ordered and it would be a few minutes because they have to be made from scratch.  A little confused now since they were in the order and everyone knew it but again, I sat and waited.  In about 5 minutes the young man brought me a tray with 3 rolls and said "here you go - have a nice evening".  I looked at him and said where are the other 3, I ordered 6?  A look of confusion came over his face, he went back to the young lady (who I assume was the mgr on duty), told her and she asked someone to make another order.  She came back to me, apologized and asked if there was anything else she could get for us, nope just the rolls was my answer.  This took about another 10 minutes.   Now, she did apologize for all the delays and gave me a gift card to use and the food was good.  Service was really poor.  I don't understand how two people can read your order off to you and then the kitchen can't get it made.  In my estimation, I must have waited until at least 6:15 until we received our full order of food.   I'm hoping they were just having a bad night but they do need to work some bugs out of their online ordering system.

This is our favorite theatre and the service had improved with age. Cinema Suites is the most comfortable with the larger chairs.  They have changed their menu and I really like it. So far we've had the pretzel bites, quinoa salad bowl, chopped salad bowl and the brussel sprouts appetizer, which in my opinion was to die for! Just wish they still had the veggie appetizer platter.

Quick, clean and friendly must be the motto of this company!  From my initial phone call with James to the delivery of the wood. We were scheduled for the Saturday after Christmas but they had a cancellation a few days before and got it delivered. Derrick arrived by himself, stacked a 1/2 cord of Oak and left no debris in the yard.  I would highly recommend this company for your next firewood purchase.

I have used this company several times since 2010 and they have been nothing but upstanding, prompt and completely professional.  We have Sub Zero's and Wolf appliances and this company happens to be a certified repair specialist for them.  When we went through a remodel in 2010 our electrician blew out some major fuses in our home which resulted in control panels and other parts being fried.  Tri City came out and worked with the electrician to replace and or repair the appliances.  They have come out several times since for annual maintenance and right now they are coming out to rebuild a cooling system in the beverage drawers.  The same repair specialist comes each time and he knows my appliances like they were his own.   I would recommend this company to everyone!

A few different areas to review here. We live in Phoenix and were running in the Phoenix Marathon and Half Marathon.  There were a total of 5 of us.  I had reserved two rooms, one with a king bed and the other with two beds.  I had confirmation #'s for both rooms and both rooms were in my name.  The day before our check-in I called the hotel to confirm and to ask them to put our friends name on the room that had the king bed in it because they were most likely to arrive before us and would like to check-in without me there.  As it turned out, we arrived together so we checked in together.  I was first and was given the king room.  When I advised the clerk that I had reserved the double room for me he looked for the other room and I could tell from the look on his face that there was a problem.  He took my piece of paper that had our confirmation #'s written on them into the back office where we could see everything play out on the video screen that was at the front desk.  Soon a man came out that must have been a manager - advising me that we were suppose to check in the day before for a 3 night stay and when we didn't they cancelled our room.  I told him that that was a mistake on their part because I had booked the rooms at the same time with everything being the same with the exception of the # of beds in the room.  He again told me that the room was cancelled and that they were full for the night and there was nothing he could do.  I was getting pretty angry now and told him that it was unacceptable especially since it was their mistake and he had better find me a room.  Believe it or not but he found me a room!  Then when we made a joke about how lucky we were to have him solve the situation, joking that did you have to throw someone out, he told us that it actually caused him a lot of work to find a room for us!  Really, it caused you a lot of work??  Your clerked messed up my reservation, it wasn't my fault and you are complaining to me that this caused you extra work??  The hotel was advertised with having a hot breakfast for the runners which it did not have.  They told us that we could have a danish and coffee.  We also had coffee in our room which was fine.  They advertised shuttles for the runners. Yes, this was available but we did not use this service.  Our room was old because the hotel was old.  The room was very clean but did have a smell to it.  I think the housekeeping staff does a fine job with what they have to work with.  Would I stay there again?  No

Stopped into Venues Cafe on a Friday afternoon to a have a cocktail before heading out after a day in the Carefree/Cave Creek area.  This is a very cute place tucked away with a nice wine list and full bar.  The restaurant/bar area is nicely laid out with a great atmosphere and very friendly staff.  The samplings of wine that we were provided with were almost as much as you'd get when you ordered a glass!  We did not have any food so I cannot comment on that but next time we are in the area we will stop in and spend a little bit more time and order some food.

We have been to ThirteeNorth a few times now and have wanted to wait until writing this review, just to make sure we were accurate.  Well, we were!  This place is just what the North Central area has needed for a very long time.  The food and service are exactly what you would expect from a restaurant.    You are greeted right when you walk through the front door (usually they open the door for you) and you are promptly given a table or a bar seat (if you are lucky enough to be there at the right time).  Your beverage order is taken immediately and the dinner and specials menu is to die for.  We have had the Steak Wrap; Delmonico Steak; Prime Rib Sandwich plus various appetizers and salads and all have been fabulous!  We are people that love to dine at the bar so that we can people watch and have conversations with others.  The bar staff are some of the best that we have seen in years.   The young lady with the long dark hair knows how to serve a drink.  She knows how to make whatever you want and always serves it with a smile on her face.  The owners are eager to learn what you like and don't like.  I believe that ThirteeNorth will be around the North Central area for quite some time and I am very happy about that.

I had been going to a couple different small fitness clubs in the past few years, one doing personal training with weights and the other doing the medicine ball routine. Both clubs went out of business and I was wondering what I was going to do. My daughter had started Pure Barre in Beverly Hills and loved it.  She called me and told me I should start because she thought that it was what I was looking for. She couldn't have been more right!  I have been going since April 2012 and I absolutely love it!  Every time I walk in the door I'm greeted with a smile- I love the owners and all the teachers. It's not like every other workout, they make you comfortable with what you can and can't do.  They are excellent at describing each technique and correcting you if you don't have the right pose.  They pay special attention to you to make sure that you don't hurt yourself.  In your first class you will be very confused as to what "tucking" is but by the third class you will know exactly what it is. The moves change up every so often to keep things fresh. The music is very motivating and you just lose yourself for a hour.  I walk out of the class exhausted but feeling so good.   You will see a difference in your body within 10 classes. It's a workout that you have to try! Trust me, you won't regret it.

We've been coming here every few months since it opened and each time we have left satisfied. We usually try to sit at the bar because typically service is better there. The times that we've had to sit at the tables it seems like the servers forget about you after your meal is served. But with saying that, we will return again.  Their craft beers are very good, food portions are on the larger side, especially if you get a hamburger!! If you leave hungry it's your own fault. Grilled chicken is amazing, roasted cauliflower, ahi....yum! They have a very small patio with 4 tables that fronts Dunlap. A nice little restaurant in North Central Phoenix that you should try.

Had some friends in town that were staying out by the stadium so it was my job to find a casual place for dinner on that side of town.  Went to Yelp to check out some restaurants and decided to give Whiskey Rose Bar & Grill a try based on the reviews and I liked their name!   Sure glad that we did.  We were seated right away, server came over immediately and took our drink and appetizer order.  She came back a couple times to take our food order but we were too busy chatting and hadn't looked at the menu.  Not a problem, she was very nice about it.   Finally ordered our food and it was very very good.  Large portions that most of us ended up taking home.  You will not go away hungry from this place.  BBQ was excellent and falling off the bone. Had a nice experience at Whiskey Rose and if I am ever on that side of town again we will be dining there.

We used this company for the past few years but this year we couldn't get them to provide us with a commitment for some firewood. I'd go someplace else.

Great happy hour prices for drinks and food items but if you want to sit at the bar, you will have a wait most of the times due to it's  popularity but it's worth it.  Love the trio of meatballs, salads and pizzas.  OMG, the sauce is so delicious!  Bar staff is very attentive and friendly.

What a great find!  This location has housed many many restaurants and I sure hope this one is very successful.  The menu is very simple with many types of items to choose from that should suit everyone's tastes.  Prices are very reasonable as well and although we did not partake in the happy hour it looks fabulous as well. There were three of us and we started with the fried green tomatoes which were lightly breaded and yummy!  Two had the fish special which was Ahi and it was huge and for only $18.  The other dish was the fish tacos which was on the appetizer side of the menu.  Two tacos loaded with blackened Ahi.  It was more than enough to fill you up. I made my reservation through the Yelp seat me service, received a confirmation instantly of the reservation and then about 15 minutes prior to the reservation I received a very simple text asking me to either confirm or cancel the reservation.   Our server was Jake.  He approached us right away with waters and took our drink orders then explained the specials.  He was within reach whenever we needed him but gave us our privacy. This is a location that is really good for either a before or after movie or just if you are dining out for the night.  I would highly recommend trying Ten out and we will be back for sure in the near future.   Good Job Ten!

I can't say enough about Doggy Daze!  All my dogs went to Sean's previous location and when I saw that he was opening a new location we were all so happy!  The dogs go in and are done within 2 hours. Very very clean store, great groomers and so friendly!  I can guarantee that your dogs will love getting their make overs done by Doggy Daze!!

I came here the first part of August and found some great bottoms and tops.  Store was very busy, tons of help and best of all they did a flash sale, 3 bottoms for $100!!   Today I came and it was horrible from beginning to end. To start, there was a football game but other than traffic I really didn't think parking would be an issue.  They tried to charge me $10 to park which I flat out refused to pay, even after I was told it could go towards my purchase. I parked for free.  Upon entering the store I was greeted and told where the sale items were. I went to the racks where the pants were. Not only were they very ugly (outlet store) they were all priced at $89 or more. Seriously not much less than going to the normal stores and getting great merchandise.  The help wasn't any better. In the back they were dancing and all the others were having private conversations.  Oh and did I mention that I was the only one in the store. It was pretty pitiful.  I'm not real sure if I'll ever be back.
