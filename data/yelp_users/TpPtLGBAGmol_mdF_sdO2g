I was fortunate enough to be invited to the Richard Petty Driving Experience about a month ago. It was the coolest thing I've ever done in Vegas and trust me I have seen allot of Vegas. I got to go about 140 mph on the track in the car by myself. This wasn't just a ride along deal, I got to drive the car following a professional driver. If you ever get the chance to do this you will remember it for the rest of your life!

The atmosphere here is awesome! Now don't expect a fine dining experience. You can expect full liters of beer, delicious wieners, German music, and a whole lotta lederhosen. This review may be a little bias due to me deep love for all things German. If you like German food and happen to be in Vegas stop by the Hofbrauhaus!

I will make this one short and sweet. This is the second chef Mina restaurant I have been to in the last month ( American Fish in Vegas). I would go back to any of his establishments in a heart beat.  We had two dozen oysters, duck fat french fries, foie gras sliders, duck fat fried chicken with truffle mac and cheese, bone in prime rib, creme brulee, and the cheesecake pistachio streusel. Ohhhhh my lord did I just say that! It ended up being top five meals of my life. So F-ing delicious I shed a tear just thinking of it. If you ever have the chance to try any of  Michael Mina's places don't even think twice about it, JUST DO IT!  Service= 5 stars,  Ambiance= 5 stars,  Food= OFF THE CHARTS!

If you have never eaten at a Brazilian churrascaria this place is a pretty good representation of one. Word to the wise...... get ready for a mass intake of meat products.   The menu here is non existent. You sit down, order some beverages, and get down and dirty. The salad bar here is definitely above par for the course (to all of you golfers: the salad bar just shot a 69 at Augusta). I think it had thirty five or so items to excite the palate. Now don't fill up with all of that rabbit food because the next stop is protein town, population you. In my mind I said "bring on the beef!" I think that message was picked up subliminally by every waiter in the joint. The moment I was done with my salad our table was surrounded by beautiful glistening beef, lamb, chicken, even a little pork. I made the fatal mistake of thinking I could  try a little of everything. At the end of the meal I was so overloaded with meat products I almost passed out at the table. The quality of the meat and flavors was top notch and highly recommended.  I guess I should also note the service was fantastic. All of the meats are made to order. The lamb was a little over done for my taste and they had a fresh skewer of rare meat out in a flash. All of the drinks were full and the house had a pretty good wine selection.

I cant believe this place is still open. the food was terrible. they do have a great beer selection but that's about it. Not even close to German food. Who ever is pickling the food over there deserves to be shot.
