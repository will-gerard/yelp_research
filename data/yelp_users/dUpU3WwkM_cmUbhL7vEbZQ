Service is beyond sub par.  Brunette waitress who appears to be pregnant acts like taking your order is inconvenient.  My food sat in the window while the cook rang the bell over and over and she walked up and yelled "how many times are you going to ring the bell".  Not surprisingly food was lukewarm but not poorly prepared.  Feel sorry for the kitchen since cold food and long waits clearly aren't their issue.  Several people in the bar were overserved to the point of a drunken stupor (illegal in Scottsdale).  Fight almost broke out between two men next to me.    Needs real management.  Likely a candidate for the show Bar Rescue.

I stopped coming here since the kitchen was under performing but thought I would  give it another try.  Menu has been updated and my burger was perfectly cooked, which hadn't happened before.  Might be new management or a new chef but they earned my business back

Food was fantastic,  service was excellent,  price was a good value.  Easy to spend money at Cityscape and get a lot less for your money than Strand.

There are so many places with great food in Scottsdale but few with the service that you get here.  Everyone treats you like a VIP

One of my favorite little places in Old Town.  They have a nice selection of craft beer with happy hour 7 days a week until 7.  Happy Hour menu includes a variety of foods including pizza and a great pasta dish for $10.  On the main menu, the vegetable risotto is perfectly prepped.   This location hasn't been successful in the past but on the strength of a good menu, Evo has broken that trend.

Well been here somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes sitting at the bar and no one has even said hi.  Good band playing earns it 1 star.  The rest is an incomplete

After a tough first try I gave this place another try.  Very happy I did.  Prices are very reasonable for South Scottsdale.  Breakfast served all day is a plus for me.   Still a great place to see live music.

Food was great.  Service was great.   My only concern was that the bar struggled making their signature drinks. Still, a great value in old town
