This place is quick and centrally located, but the food is pretty average. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's useful for when I'm in the area.

Maybe I ordered wrong but this was the blandest Thai food I've ever had. Mee krob was too sweet, tom ka gai was thin, and evil jungle princess was pretty one note. Ordered a 4 on a 5 point heat scale and could barely detect the spice. Added extra chile powder to try to zip up the flavor toward the end. That kind of helped, but not much. Every plate that I saw leave the kitchen appeared to be the same color! Service was okay, but there was only one person serving during the dinner rush. This place is adequate but not great.

Since this place is on so many "top ten" lists, I thought for sure that I was going to get a very expensive, maybe good experience. Very pleased to be wrong on that front! Staff was very helpful when explaining the menu and the items were all well prepared and extremely tasty. The standouts were the Raku's Tofu (get the full order--we got the half and ended up ordering it twice), the sashimi salad (very generous for the price), the duck with balsamic soy glaze, the enoki mushrooms with bacon and the asparagus okaki. We stuck mostly with the skewers and were surprisingly full given the small bites. And our check was not astronomical--a plus! This is now on our list of places to go in Vegas.

Love, love, love this place. Our cheese monger, France, was a delightful woman who was exceptionally helpful and guided us through a huge selection of cheeses. She was generous with samples and had an instinct about what we would like. I think we ended up buying all but two of her recommendations. She was also very thoughtful in packing the cheeses for travel to the US, which was also helpful for clearing customs. I will definitely return.

I can't believe I've never been here before. This will now be part of my routine when I travel to Chandler to stock up on supplies. Noodles had just the right amount of chew and were well seasoned. My favorite, though, was the spicy pig's ears: an old favorite that I haven't had in a long time. Lightly chewy and crispy at the same time, very thinly sliced, and nicely flavorful. Lunch and a show! Totally will be returning.

Happy hour deals are very good and service was delightful. Fried sausage ravioli are a must try!

Awful. Almost no cheese, and what was on it was barely covering the tip of the slice. Incredibly grumpy staff. I should have walked to another concourse but I didn't have much time. Concourse B1-14 is the orphan concourse now; so many better options for food in other concourses. Well, at least the slice was hot.

Decided to try again. I don't know why. Pizza is actually okay, but the service is so inadequate that can't endorse this place. The cashier didn't give correct change and simply can't be bothered with customers, and last time, I had no cheese on my pizza. Guess I'll go out of my way to Humble Pie next time.
