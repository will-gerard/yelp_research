What's a terrible experience I had at this location ! I had purchased a blower around 3 weeks ago and the thing just DIE on me, unfortunately I had to turned in my receipt to my corporate office so I didn't had it on me at this time, the manager on Duty was NOT helpful at all, he dint offer any other solutions to help my issue other then "sorry you have to pay the 18 dollars to get it diagnostic" now I paid for a product that it was defected and now I have to pay $18.00 to get it looks at?!!  I'm here EVERY SINGLE WEEK! But now I will drive myself out of the way to Lowes because the level of interaction and the dead personality of his gentleman made me feel like it was my fault that this particular piece of equipment failed.   So Home Depot you can keep your blower, and I won't return for a loooooong time and I know you guys have tons of customers and probably don't care. Maybe in the future when you can properly train your managment and teach them how to make customers feel valuable and important not just another transaction.    Good luck!

I'm not going to say that this was a horrible experience because it wasn't the actual manager was very very nice but she still wasn't able to helped me. I recently renewed my Geek squad thech support online but apparently that doesn't sync with all your purchases at the store. So I was forced to go look for a receipt at the house. And now that I have it I'm going to the Best Buy and Avondale. Because this is where I live. And even though arrowhead it's either my way I use to go there because they used to treat people right. And I know she was probably overwhelmed with all those customers on a Tuesday. But she could've take my computer in service it and give me the benefit of the doubt and charge me at pick up if I was in the wrong.  But she choosed not to. Oh well

Omg this was one of the worst experiences I ever had in a restaurant,  to start the lady at the front desk kept repeating her self that the restaurant was closing in 45 minutes , she turn around 2 Mexican families away, and then at 746 a White family shows up and guess what? They get an option of get there meals to go, unbelievable!  Its all about them apparently ...there is clear tables in the back of the restaurant but there are not longer available because is closing Time.  This manager in Duty is not in control,  the employees are... hahaha I'm a facility manager my self and this crew should be ashamed of there selfs .. one of the server's comes out and screams NO MoRE! ..I don't want nothing free I'm just gonna use my Christmas gift card and let my customers and friends know about the service on this place.
