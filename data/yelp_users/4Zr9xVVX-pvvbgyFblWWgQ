Just finished getting a haircut and shave for my wedding tomorrow by Izzy (I think that's his name). He did a fantastic job. The shave was amazing. I found my new barbershop!

The burgers we had were extremely bland, the grilled mushrooms on the burger were ice cold. The fries were decent. Will not be returning here. Very disappointed.
