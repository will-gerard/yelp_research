For long story short, skip to the bottom-  I love Einstein's. The variety of bagels and shmear are great. The customer service is always fast and they have you moving along. At this location, all the employees are friendly and are prompt to get things done for you except when you ask for coffee to be brewed..   I ordered a bagel and coffee to go around 8:05 am and got through the line and checked out at 8:08 am. Fast, right? There was no autumn brewed coffee out so I asked when it would be ready and they said shortly. So I decide to eat my bagel there and check back in around 8:20 and ask of they're even going to make any and he said he would go in the back and check. He didn't give me an update so... I wait.  I finished the other half of my bagel  and check back in around 8:30 and they said in a couple minutes. I know I shouldn't have wasted my time, but I was curious to if they actually meant a few minutes so, I waited. I did not see anything out by 8:40 so I said "fuck it", sucked it up and got Vanilla Hazelnut coffee and walked out..  Long story short, their Autumn brewed coffee is my favorite (you have no idea) and after asking 3 times for it and waiting 40 minutes and it still was not ready, it would be faster for you to buy the damn coffee grounds and brew it yourself at home or at the office. I know, it's just coffee, but lets be real.. It's disappointing to specifically go in for your favorite coffee and not even get it.

I like Harkins and it is my choice of theatre over others. The consistency of going makes it better. You know what to expect and it's the same every time.   The employees are generally nicer than other theaters I've noticed and the cine Capri is huge! Always enough seats.  The only bummer is that the food is shit and anything at the counter is three times the price of what it should be.   My advice: invest in the $5 cup, so every time for the year you come back, it's only $1.50 to fill up. & always bring your own candy!

Dr. Blythe is a great Dentist! Everyone who works in the office is so nice and give you ZERO attitude which is wonderful because I came from an office where the staff was so rude!

If I could pick ONE word to describe this location, it would be... GROSS. The store, the people who go there, the parking lot, the area, it is just all gross. I would advise everyone to go to the next better one on 101 and Chaparral.

Studio Movie Grill is a great concept.. It's dinner and a movie in one. Which is why my large family always comes here. Not to mention, always $6 groupons! The 10 people in my family can see a movie for $60 instead of $100 at Harkins or AMC.  The food is pretty good. I usually stick with the basic nachos, chicken strips, etc. but I'm sure the rest is good!  The only complaints that I have, is that I feel like it takes forever to get a refill on a drink. Food is hit or miss depending on how busy it is. One time it took 30 min for me to get popcorn and then 10 min to get grilled chicken strips. Like I said.. Hit or miss.  A lot of people don't like the servers walking through the isles constantly, but once you're actually engaged in the movie, you don't even notice. (I've also never had an isle seat where they walk up and down though.. That may be a distraction for some people).  The employees could work a little but more on their customer service.. I mean it's whatever since I'm there to watch a movie. But when you sound rude and miserable asking "who had the nachos?" You should probably get a new job. Something you enjoy!  And last, always go for the row with the lounge chairs and swivel table.. Much better than the office chairs in the other rows!
