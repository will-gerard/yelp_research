I can't say enough great things about Dr. Cohen! He truly saved me. He is my favorite doc.   I had an accident on my way to the conference. I was rushing because I am always totally over-committed and stabbed myself in my left eye with a round bristle brush. It hurt. Badly. I was and am mad at myself that I created this injury and tried to shake it off the best I could. Let me tell you that this has been a huge eye opening experience for me (pun intended again). I have to slow down.  The pain was terrible but in me fashion I pulled myself somewhat together and drove down to my conference. I made it through meeting each of the vendors while wearing sunglasses but I was determined to complete the day. I didn't realize until the next evening that I was in trouble. My left eye completely swollen and the pain unbearable I finally decided to call my new eye Dr. and ask for some help. It is one thing to be tough and it is another to be stupid. I was a little of both but luckily I had a great doc on the other end of the phone who was smart.  Thankfully, I had one appointment with my new eye Dr. Cohen a few weeks prior to this incident to check the overall health of my peepers. I hate doctors but after my last few weeks receiving care from Dr. Cohen from Doctor My Eyes, I think I can make an exception for him. Dr. Stephen Cohen answered a call from me on Sunday morning at 7AM! He talked me through a few options but after hearing the amount of pain I was having he offered to meet me at his office that day and take a closer look! I don't know many doctors would do that. I was desperate and thankful so I went and I am happy I did. Dr. Cohen found that I had scratched nearly 40% of the cornea on my left eye and couldn't believe that I was walking around like that for the past few days. He immediately suggested placing a "disk" in my eye to begin the healing process. I can't tell you the medical background of what the disk did but in laymen's terms the disk had stem cells on it and placed in my eye while working to rebuild the cornea cells of my scratch. The advancements in technology and medicine are incredible and when you have a Dr. like Dr. Cohen who cares and is totally up to date on all treatments in his field you can't ask for more.  The disk was in my eye for 4 days and the doc took it out on Wednesday with tweezers (ewwwwww). He said the scratch is nearly 100% healed but I still have blurry vision in that eye which can be corrected with prescription and he hopes over time. I need to get off this computer/my phone and work a system of being on for 20 minutes and off for 20 minutes to treat my eyes better and let them heal completely! This was not a joke and I am taking this as a warning from up above. I am very lucky and not taking this lightly. Thank you Dr. Stephen Cohen for helping me see so much more than with my two healthy eyes.  Anyone in the Phoenix area needing an eye Dr. - I can't recommend Dr. Cohen enough. Thank you to Doctor My Eyes/Stephen Cohen, O.D. for EVERYTHING! Truly grateful for you and don't know what I would have done without you. THANK YOU! And...now, per doctor's orders...getting off the computer.

Great spot! First time there last night as I am new to scottsdale by way of Los Angeles. Been to a lot of shows but the intimate setting of this room rocked! Great lineup and would go back for sure. Good drinks and super helpful staff. I am a comedic blogger and have dealt with my share of comedians and this venue was top notch bringing in some great talent. Go!

BOOOOO! They ruined my dogs hair. Scalped him and he wasn't even matted. So unhappy I cant even tell you. The first time I went there it wasn't bad but the second time I went - well, let me put it to you this way, someone thought my dog was a poodle and he is a havanese. He was so pissed off because he knew his hair looked horrible. They were NOT even close!!!!!!! Don't go here and it smells. Plus, it is expensive.

From sf to la and now to phoenix- this is the best training school for any dog ever. They treat every single dog that enters through the doors as their own. I can't say enough and they transformed my life with my dog to make him the most enjoyable family member I could ever hope for! Thank you for taking teddy brewski and making him the model dog citizen he is today!!!  Parnters and the staff, especially Leighton, Stephanie, Amy, and Kalina are part of Teddy Brewski and my fam now! I can always count on them! Thanks! WOOF

Food wasn't bad and wasn't great. Service was terrible. The waitress could have cared less about our table. She was so rude. I am so irritated that I am writing this true review from a table in the restaurant. I won't ever come back.

Walked into this eyeglass store that advertised for eye exams. I asked if there was a dr. there. The girl at the front said she couldn't remember if the dr was an ophthalmologist or an optometrist. She had to look at his degree hanging on the wall to tell me. Scary.  The store was little. You think she should know that. Right?? I also brought 4 pairs of glasses that needed new lenses- did she want the business .. No. Do people even work anymore? Wtf??? She let me leave without taking my number or any info. about switching the lenses.

Food is pretty good but the service is terrible. Fire the entire lunch crew except the kitchen. The two Chefs were the only people working in there today. Boo. Rude waitresses.

OMG! I can not say enough great things about Hypoxi and this location. Shawdi is awesome! She is has become a personal trainer, motivator and now a friend! She has given me my motivation back to get fit and toned. I am so happy that I saw the sign for this gym and for stopping in a few weeks ago. After just 5 sessions I am down 6 inches all over and in those very hard to burn fat spots aka tush, thighs, tummy, etc. Can't wait to see what another 6 sessions does for me! Being a blogger - it isn't hard for me to include Hypoxi as one of the main reasons I am happier, healthier and on the road to being fit once again. Thank you!!!!
