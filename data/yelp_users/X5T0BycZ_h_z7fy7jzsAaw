I think this place is OK. I believe most people who like it are new to vegitarian-vegan items.

If you have a plain pallet you will like this place otherwise don't waste your time. My wife enjoyed the drinks, but that is about it.

To get more detailed I would give it a 3.7. The highlight of this place are the drinks and desserts. The meals are above average but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be.

My son says the hot dogs are pretty good, but the service is not good at all.

Started off with tuna and calamari for appetizers. The tuna was ok, but the calamari  was amazing.  My wife had some peach mixed drink that she enjoyed. My highlight of the meal is actually the Mista salad. This salad was awesome. If you like goat cheese you have to try this salad. I had the Seafood Risotto which was a great dish.

This Chef is the real deal! There were four of us that went out and we all had different meals varying from fish, burger, pork chop, and chicken and we all loved our dishes.
