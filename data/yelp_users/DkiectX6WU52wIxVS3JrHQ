The bartenders are some of the most bitchy girls there are. But go on Monday for two for one burgers if you can handle the rude people working.

Great tasting food but probably some of the smallest portions I've had. Only worth it if nothing else is open when you're drunk.

This place is great. I just got my first order and the food is fantastic with a very welcoming owner. You might not notice it driving by but it's definitely worth finding.
