Some of the best Italian i've had in AZ. Love the bruschetta gorgonzola cheese with honey, the butternut squash ravioli, and the Orvieto Classico Malvasia wine.

Used Howard Air through Angie's List promotion. They came out, did an inspection, and came back to get my A.C. unit up to par even though it's 10 years past it's general life span. Explained to me everything that was wrong with it and were willing to fix the most important issues for a reasonable price.

Best tortillas in the state hands down. The usual for me is a bean n cheese burrito double wrapped. There salsa is also unique and delicious. Wouldn't mind if this place was opened later....

Will try not to eat here unless I am drunk. Greasiest tortillas I've ever eaten. The location off Guadalupe and Mcclintock is much tastier.

Great pizza, toppings, and wings. The price for the special (2 slices and a drink) has gone up which doesn't it make the stamp card worth while anymore, but I'm fine with water. The slices are large and two easily fill you up. Definitely my goto place since I am located in Tempe, as well as in my top 5 pizza places in the valley. They also have a food challenge here which entails eating a party pizza (5 slices each) with another patron. Some dudes supposedly took this down in 7 minutes, I don't believe it.

This place is my second favorite place to get pho in  Phoenix (Pho 68 being number 1). If you come here expect the broth to be oily, or as my girlfriend put it extremely buttery. I loved the broth because it was a drastic change from my usual place, and it was very tasty. They also have an array of international sodas which you should try, stay away from the egg york though.

Remember eating here a couple years ago and the pho was really bland. Even though it's the closest pho place to my house, I'd rather make the trip to Pho 68 or De Vangs.

Other than a couple waitresses with big jugs this place doesn't have much to offer. The food is bland and over priced. Only positive thing I can say is that that they warm up their muffins.

No wait, cheap prices, and excellent taste. The best hummus and falafel sandwhichs in town. Be sure you order the pita's hand made.

I usually go here about 1:45- 2:15 a.m. Fridays or Saturdays during the school year to watch people fight., the pizza tastes like cardboard, and the crust will cut the roof of your mouth. Also there ranch tastes weird...

You'll like this pizza if you like sweat sauce. You also have the options of going thin, thick, or gluten free. This along with Venezias, Joes, and le grande orange are my favorite in the valley.

Hands down the best place to get a burger in Tempe. This place pwns in and out and five guys. I usually get the big one, but have fucked around with the tijauno torpedo, as well as the great big one (too much meat for my taste). They also have great appetizers (mushrooms, and onion rings), but tend to avoid the fries. The wings here are unique, worth a try, but stick with the burgers.

Great red curry, pad thai, and rice. They can make it as spicy as you want, but you have to ask them to make it thai spicy to some degree.

I've been a regular here the past 3 years. Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation.

Best breakfast burritos hands down as well as tasty salsa to eat it with. I enjoy the egg, cheese, tomato, and union which you can substitute the flour tortilla for wheat.

Good: Waffle, Chilaquiles (mixture of tortillas, ranchero sauce, chicken, sour cream & cedar cheese topped w/ egg), house made granola, and Waffle Dogs. Also they made a mixture of maple syrup w/ Chalula to dip the waffle dog in which was surprisingly tasty. The chicken fried chicken with waffle hot sauce/syrup is worth a tasting, but Lola's is probably better. Definitely will go back.     Stray away from:  3 eggs w/ sirloin and caramelized onions   Only reason I am giving them 4 stars is that the meals are kind of heavy.

Trying to boost the reviews to this place. because this is by far one of the best pho places in the valley, that's if your looking for a clear broth with a little zip to it. i have been to a couple better pho places in Long Beach and New York, but for Arizona this one is the cream of the crop. The pho is tasty, the servers are friendly, and I enjoy the sometimes bizarre Vietnamese music videos that play in the back ground.

Went here a couple times: liked the homemade lemonade, chicken (the best fried chicken i've eaten in Az), catfish (never had eaten catfish this good anywhere), waffles (remind me of waffle house), corn bread, and mac n cheese. Didn't like the gizzards and gravy, but would go back to get the gizzards minus the gravy. Did I mention I am a fat fuck, oh yeah!

Split  a couple of dishes and dessert with my friend. First and foremost my favorite item was the pineapple fried rice (came with Chicken, Raisins, Nuts, Pineapple) which was made spicy, the combination of the spices and the pineapple makes me want to come here again. Also got a noodle dish called the pad key mew w/ tofu that was pretty good and spicy enough for my tasting, but my friend recommended to get it Thai Spicy if your into that. Finished up with sticky rice w/ mango and a Thai Iced Tea... Get there while you can.  Oh yeah and their music was killing it, Tracy Chapman, Shawn Colvin, Men at Work, some 90's shit.

Best tacos I've ever had. Ate the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco (pork shoulder taco) as well as the Baja Surf Dogfish Shark Taco. The pork shoulder was my favorite because of how well the marinations blended with the pork as well as the small hint of cinnamon... Fucked up good! Both tacos came with a plate of rice and beans.  As mentioned before the pork shoulder taco has cinnamon in it which my girlfriend is allergic to so she switched if for the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco. The carne asada was well done and you could taste the mesquite charcoal it was made on. The salsa bar is another reason why this restaurant is good, due to  how diverse it was. There were so many salsas that we couldn't test them all before the chips ran out; can't remember the names of all of them, but the peanut salsa was awesome.

Fully backing @welcomechickenanddonuts Just devoured the Lassi doughnut. I took my friend  yesterday, for her first time and made her buy me a couple doughnuts for later; thanks girl. The sweats aren't the only amazing thing this place offers; their fried chicken is the best, and they serve toddy. Sorry LoLo's there's a new #1 fried chicken place in the valley.

Great reliable bike shop located in Downtown Phoenix with a delectable coffee shop. Shop carries Giants, Felt, State and an array of other road, cyclocross, commuters/hybrids, and some independent high end stuff. The staff all rides, the turn over time on repairs is fast, and the work is done well. The coffee shop serves some of the best/strongest cold brew via ColdPress coffee. There's a group ride that leaves the shop every Sunday at 6:30 in the A.M.

Really good tacos, that were prepared quickly. Had the asada, carnitas, and chiwas tacos.  Demolished them all within a couple minutes. These reminded me of the street tacos I had in Baja. Salsa bar is on point as well. Will definitely be back.
