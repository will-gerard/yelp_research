Their OJ has the texture of milk. It is so strong I have to add ice to it. Hubby loves the coffee here. Everyone seems real sweet and happy. A bunch of hippies from the Bay Area.

The coffee is decent. We used to come here regularly. Then all of a sudden, it changed to closing at 3pm. Who does that?!

You will probably be fine as long as you can manage to stay away from the ice water, the edamame, and the fish.

Our regular place is Butters down the street. The wait was gonna be an hour today, so we yelped around and found this place.  Service was not professional but ok. The food was just disappointing. The eggs came out cold, waffle was tasteless. They forgot our bacon and we had to ask about it. We could not finish our food although were still hungry. Maybe we had high expectations from the extremely positive yelp reviews. This seems to be the worst breakfast place we've ever been to.
