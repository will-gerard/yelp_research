The bouncers and especially are rude with a power trip and can suck a DICK. They wouldn't allow my friend and i in the bar because we were wearing shorts on while other customers were wearing shorts. Such Liars! That place is overrated. Big douche bar! BITCH IT AINT VEGAS! !

Well this is thee best BBQ place in the greater phoenix area, without a doubt as you can see this place is 5 stars hands down from the moment you're greeted on the lot to walking in the door! Get there early before they open (10:15) or expect to stay in a very long line...but either way I promise you its well worth the wait!! I had The Jefe (hefā) - Chopped brisket sausage, pickles, slaw and house sauce and man oh man don't regret it for a second!!!
