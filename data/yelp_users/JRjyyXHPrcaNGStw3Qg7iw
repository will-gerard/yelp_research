Worst pizza both my husband and I felt sick after eating it!! All the toppings fell off and it arrived cold!  We called for them to come an pick it back up and the manager wanted to give us another crappy pizza!  Never order from them!!  Tasted rancid!!  I wish their were a negative rating. And by the way word of mouth is everything!

Carne Asada  tacos are beef marinated in soy sauce powder and brown sugar!  So if you like sweet meat it's great but if you think it's going to taste like traditional CA than you will be wrong!  The marinade was too strong and so sweet that it had turned!  It was at the alcohol sugar stage already!  But the AZ Rolls are always amazing!  Still having my husbands bday gathering here in a few weeks!!

Amazing once again!  We had the same thing like last time!  But it was soooo good!  For me it was the Southwest Eggs Benny and for Zinny the veggie omelet.  And I love their coffee too.  The thing is I love to go to a restaurant where you want to return to have your favorite or to try more of the menu!  Our waitress was super nice as well!!  Husband was happy too!!

Wow what big portions!  Yummy sides and broth!  It was fun to pick and choose and the employees were super nice!  The wait was a bit long but wasn't the cashiers fault her swiper was not working very well.  It was a nice dimmed room but music was kinda loud!  It's the kind of dish where even when your done it doesn't look like you even made a dent!  My husband lived in Japan and he was impressed!  Yeah another local fav!!  We can even ride our bikes it's so close!

So far we have been waiting for 20 minutes and when they brought out food it was my husbands and I am still waiting for mine. So I am sitting here watching him eat. Who does that?  We were asked twice our drink orders and when I was telling him my order he was tapping on the table. Are you serious??  So far they are not impressive

Yumm!  The flavors are rich and the presentation beautiful!  Humble ownership.   And now weekend lunch buffet!  We tried places near by featured on a popular food network show and was not impressed.. But Copper Kettle is a great relaxing neighborhood spot!  Bringing my husband next time!

Seriously disappointed!!  It took our waitress to even acknowledge us 20 minutes and then after 50 minutes we walked out!! We only had an hour for lunch and we had to rush to grab McDs to bring to eat at our desks!  Why did you spend the extra money for your patio and not in hiring better more attentive staff!  Bummer word of mouth is huge!!

So amazing. We got the Maya special but added mushrooms and had red sauce instead of olive oil. So yummy!  Def get the ricotta cheese because they flavor it!
