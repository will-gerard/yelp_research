Food has always been very tasty here. The mashed potatoes are unique and tasty and mostly all dishes I have had we're good. The one I recall being a bit less in quality were the steak nachos and not because it lacked flavor or quantity, just a bit of a grizzle problem on the steak.   The patio here is one of the best in my opinion. Cozy with a fireplace and lots of fun lights. Great for an afternoon with margaritas!  Oh if u are a chips and salsa lover it is very tasty (and somewhat spicy) here.   Only reason I gave it four stars vs five is that they have a lack of desire to run their air conditioning until it is absolutely necessary which can leave it a little warm for some inside.

The store screams of a home town feel, the people working there are usually very quick to offer help and guide you through the large variety of fresh meat cuts, some unique and others as you would expect from a butcher. Knowledgeable and helpful in selecting what to pick up.  There is also a bunch of variety packs you can pick which is a nice thing to have as it forces you to try to cook a sometimes new and interesting meat.  Biggest bonus for me was that they sold not just charcoal but the same charcoal I was planninG To make a separate stop to pick up from BBQ island inc so it was a one stop shopping experience so to speak.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent butcher looking for better than a grocery store can offer

I am limited as to what I have tried from here. I have had both the sugar free and regular iced chais and a large number of their iced teas. All of the drinks I have had we're fantastic and anytime I am in tempe marketplace it's a must stop for one of the above drinks.   Food wise I haven't really tried anything so cannot comment on the quality or flavor.  Atmosphere is fun. Inside is fine but the real good seats are out front near the fountain which makes for good people watching while finishing your drinks!

The taco was the size of my palm... For being $2.39 I expected much more in quantity and in all honesty, flavor.   The Carne asada burrito at $6 was also incredibly small in portion and although it had decent flavor the "spicy" version I ordered could maybe be considered spicy if it was your first introduction to spice but anyone wanting a bit of zing won't find it here.   The chips and salsa was ok. The chips were decent but very thin so they broke fairly easily. The salsa was their mild version and in my opinion tasted like they just pur√©ed tomatoes and that's about all.   It was my first experience here and after reading how it was the highest rated in the valley I guess my expectations were too high. They gave me several small containers of various salsas. One was orange - no flavor. One was green - sweet and had a decent flavor if this is your type of salsa preference. The 'guacamole' they gave looked like it had been dispensed out of a toothpaste tube and tasted average at very best.   The bottom line is the food was decent, not great. The prices were high in relation to quantity and flavor. If youre going to eat here go on the weekdays when the tacos are $1 not $2.39.   If you are like me and tend to visit places around the valley that have been raved about and set a decently high expectation u will be let down. If u eat here out of convenience because of proximity to campus it's decent.

Ordered 2 breakfast burritos -   One of them had ranchero sauce which taste basically like tomato paste - no flavor at all, no spice at all.   The other was ordered with green chile - equally lacking in flavor but better than the ranchero.   The green chile burrito was also ordered with avocado, a 2.50 cost, and there was no avocado present in the burrito at all.   Both burritos contained more black beans than any other ingredient - there were maybe 1-2 scrambled eggs in each burrito but how could you taste the egg when every bite contained mostly black beans?  Both burritos had hashed Browns in them, however, my definition of hash browns is crispy fried potato strings and these were virtually raw sliced potatoes with not a single bit of brown showing on them.   For my total cost being 16.50 for the green chile burrito and about 13 for the ranchero this is just a huge huge waste of time and money. I could have eaten at Chelsea's kitchen and had an amazing chilaquiles with breakfast mimosas for the same price and been far far happier.  Honestly this is the biggest most overhyped breakfast restaurant I've encountered with prices that are on par with a resort and food on par with a high school cafeteria.   Save your time and money and go elsewhere.
