Hadn't been here in years. Had dinner here today. Wow. I remember it was good, but not this good. Maybe it's because I'm no longer a highschool kid ordering the cheapest thing available.

I had the Red Curry with chicken. I asked for it to be very hot. It wasn't the hottest thai food I've had but, my wife thinks I'm nuts with as hot as I like it. However, they did give me a chili powder they make in house that brought it up to the proper notch that I like  Overall, the food was good and flavorful. Worth the trek through the construction.

Good food. Great alternative to Chipotle. Price vs portions are resonable.   Line was resonable, but I was in at a slower time.  Did ask the Manager about some of the reviews saying the lines are bad. They are aware of the issue and are looking to change some things.
