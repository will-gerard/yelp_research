Nice place to stop on your way into Phoenix.  It's welcoming beauty of Arizona as you walk through the gardens. Plenty of opportunity to learn and enjoy the scenary.    I took plenty of pictures and as I took in what Phoenix had to offer gained a better appreication for the cactus!

Clean and relaxing service.    The chairs are comfortable and the nail technicians are very precise on their pedicures and manicures.  They did a great job and reasonably priced.

Fashion and food in the same place. The area is nice clean and trendy with shops and restaurants.  A great place to stop if you need to burn some money and walk around!

What a shame the groupon was the only reason I give it a star to begin with.  The meal cost us nothing but the food was worth nothing to begin with.   There was no flavor to the sushi and the service was poor.

After reading some good reviews we decided to buy a groupon for this place while in town for a week.  Excited to have drinks and dinner we made our way over after shopping in Scottsdale.  At first since it was dark the streets seemed a bit sketchy but as soon as we walked in the place was magical.  There were lights strung across the courtyard and live music playing in the restaurant.  There was limited seating indoors but the weather was pleasant so we sat outside.  The service was a bit slow and the dim to no lighting made it hard to read the menu but once we were able to see what we were ordering I decided to have the Fuego Seafood Chile Relleno : a signature dish; scallop,shrimp, and Mahi Mahi stuffed in a jumbo Pasilla pepper with a panko crust and a lobster chile cream sauce.  The food made the extra star on the rating.  Amazing and fullfilling to the max! The Chile was full of flavor and the side dishes could have easily been a dish on their own! The corn bread puts any other corn bread to shame and the mashed potatoes were the perfect creamy and extra kick with cajun flavor.  I'm glad we had this groupon otherwise would never had made our way to this hidden gem.

My first air balloon ride and I did it just right and in style.  This about 2 hour ride was filled with breathtaking views and great narration by our 2 pilots.  Our group was fun and entertained by all the sights and talk in the air.   When we landed we were greeted with a champagne toast and beautiful picnic brunch.  We had chocolate croissants, quiche, apples and cheese and ever flowing mimosas.    It was the perfect ending to our great trip to Arizona.

Never ridden a horse in my life but Cowboy Way made it a great adventure!  The cowboys and cowgals were all very friendly and guided us down a safe and fun journey in the desert.   The tour was 3 hours and my horse "Grandma" was quite a sassy one! She took a while to liking me but once she knew I wasn't going anywhere she took me for a great ride!  It was a great way to celebrate my best friends birthday and a try something new!
