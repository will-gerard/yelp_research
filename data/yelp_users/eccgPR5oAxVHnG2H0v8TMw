I've been here probably 15 times. I usually order the beef udon dish. It's excellent! Their chicken parmesan is also so flavorful and impressive. The environment is quaint. Gives me a "hole in the wall" feel. This is my favorite noodle spot. Having been to Okinawa, Japan has made me kind of a noodle snob. However, Cherryblossom meets my craving :) YUM!

I used to come here once every few weeks back in 2010, and loved the orange chicken lunch. Came back today after relocating from east valley, same recipe, same amazing taste. The eggdrop soup is a cure for hangovers and colds. Love that stuff! This is my favorite little spot. That staff is always friendly. It was nice to see some familiar faces from 2010. Definitely coming back.

Do yourself a favor and try the salmon super food and the goat cheese baguette. Phenomenal roast chicken. This wine bar vibe is just what the doctor ordered. Graffiti mural upstairs. Very trendy, great food that's carefully prepared. Indulge!

The bartender David was exceptionally knowledgeable of the menu and catered to my taste with suggestions such as the albacore crunch roll and lobster dynamite. He paired my meal with a peach saketini which was delicious. The food came out promptly and was prepared beautifully. This place is really classy and inviting. It is somewhere I'll invite girls for a night out, or have an intimate dinner with my mate. Can't wait to to revisit.

I ordered the biscuits and gravy and an iced latte. The gravy was savory and the biscuits fresh and fluffy. The latte was perfectly flavored, not too sugary with the shot of flavor. We'll be coming here more often. Staff is incredibly friendly. I will be telling friends about this gold mine!

Stopped in for a beer and some pretzels. Their cheese is the bomb. Staff is friendly and attentive. Will be coming back. Try the old chub nitro if you're a Guinness lover, yum!

Please bring back the Scottsdale Burrito! The jive omelette was bland. Literally smothered it with hot sauce to finish. This is our favorite breakfast joint, but missing the old menu terribly.  UPDATE: got my Scottsdale burrito :)

Excellent market fish dish and chocolate raspberry torte. It's a must have menu everyone should check out. My foodie friends are going to flip over this place. Amazing!

The California omelette was huge, very filling. The hashbrowns were krispy and not smothered with butter.  Food took a little long to come out, but was definitely worth the wait. This is so close to us that we will be revisiting often.

Last pour is at 9:30 on a Friday. Listed open until 10 on a Friday, lamesauce. Fix your ad please, waste of travel time. This isn't a town with the population of 600...

The best udon noodles. I've been to Japan, and this place does an excellent job with presentation and preparation. Has a cool lounge vibe, excellent drink selection and its affordable. Trumps RA!

The ambiance was awesome! Had a couple tacos, baja and carnitas, excellent taste. The shrimp ceviche was citrus rich. Did a pitcher of their market beer. Dined on the patio, quick service.

Mr. Greenbaum is skilled in remote access solutions. I was having serious issues at work with an impossible deadline. I had 4 IT guys try to work things out, but none of them really knew how to get me the answers I needed. I'm happy to say Joseph saved the day within a few hours and walked me through, step by step, giving me not only a solution, but a method of helping others at my work having the same issues. In addition, I initially met him while he was a nightlife photographer. He produced very high quality photos of my friends and I. I recommend him for professional headshots, weddings and events.

Came here for breakfast. Ordered the bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. It was very disappointing. See photos for reference.

New management sadly does not mean new and improved. Brought the pup's out with us for some patio lounging. The waitress was not happy at all from the moment we arrived to the moment we paid and brought up our groupon deal. She told us we weren't allowed to have our dogs on our laps- when they were both laying patiently on the floor...not a good vibe. She never offered water for our pups, thankfully we had some. She didn't offer suggestions for the new menu items. When I asked for them her reply was "everything is good." There was only 4 other tables occupied while we were there including one right next to us on the patio. This table also agreed she was rude after her comment about the pups. Lack of customers could possibly be indicative that this restaurant isn't doing well since it changed owners. It took us 40 minutes to get our main entrees after we ordered (we only had 3 people ordering fajitas and pasta). Our glasses were refilled maybe twice. I'm sadly disappointed in this place. Also, management may want to consider new staff members as the one who served us was crass and gave the worst impression of this establishment. Working in the service industry myself, I don't know how this waitress thinks her attitude is acceptable when it directly affects her financial outcome. I would avoid this place if you can.
