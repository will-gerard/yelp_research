This place is overrated, sad to say. We have tried to get reservations here several times and each time is always a hassle and over the phone the staff always says the wait is at least an hour. We happened to get in for a party of 5 right away when we were in the area and were looking forward to finally trying the famous Cibo. The place is beautiful no doubt, atmosphere is 4 star but as far as the pizza goes you can get higher quality and price at The Parlor. We also had the calamari which was too tough and over cooked. The Parlors calamari was perfect and juicy. Our servers were also not friendly despite us only saying thank you whenever they stopped by our table. Of course, this was all just our one time experience but it did not leave a good impression.

Favorite restaurant. Wish I remembered the name of this awesome server there, but everyone is great that we have had. Food and drinks are awesome and they have great daily specials, happy hour throughout the week.

I have become a regular here when I decided to switch my business to local AZ, and have never looked back. Lola's on Roosevelt is by far my favorite cup of coffee in town. I am still exploring local coffee spots but Lola's is the best, always a quality drink and pastry! The coffee is strong and the flavor full. All of the baristas are great and just spending time in the atmosphere is great with something to work on, or a friend.

Happened to discover this salon close to my work and so glad I tried it! Walking in, it is a very pretty, nice, and clean salon. I was at first cautious since it is so hard to find a quality salon but I love how my nails came out by Ty. I got a gel fill. I was also very impressed with the wide selection of gel colors that they have. Many of the salons I have been to don't have much of a gel selection. Ty was quick and delivered a beautiful set! I will definitely be back!

Coffee is good, had an iced nonfat white mocha. Barista very nice, blonde lady. It was very quiet when I went in, around 7pm-9pm. I appreciate their hours, hard to get a local cup of coffee here after 7pm. My first choice is always Lola's but songbird offers a great alternative for after 7 :) will probably be back!

Favorite restaurant. Gilbert location was amazing as well, almost better experience than the central location but just about tied. Amazing drinks and food. Glad to see Mexican food modern and yet still a little traditionally represented. Experience is great at the bar or a table, from the first time they set the chips and salsa down!

First time there. Hadn't found a nail salon that I was too impressed with on yelp until Lish Salon! I went in for a full set, gel and it was $40 without tip, great deal I think. Kevin was my technitian he did a great job! Office assistant in the front also very nice and helpful wish I got her name! I will return!
