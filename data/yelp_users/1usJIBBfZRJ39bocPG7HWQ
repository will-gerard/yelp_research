ONO doesn't begin to cover how amazing this food is!  i grew up in Hawaii and, although NOTHING will ever stand up to the food on the island, this place comes pretty damn close as far as "plate lunch" goes.    the chicken katsu is good, the spam musubi (awesome snack when you're out surfing for the day...a personal fave) is wonderfully delicious...i LOVE the sauce they put under the spam...i'm thinking it's the katsu sauce, but i could be wrong.  my fave tho is the island curry chicken.  it has a kick, but it's freakin AWESOME!  the macaroni salad is to die for...my advice, if you're feeling naughty, skip the rice and ask for two scoops of the macaroni salad...totally worth the calories.  oh, more advice.  go for the mini meal.  it might sound small, but it is the PERFECT size!  just enough to fill you up!  mahalo to whatever lolo brought this grub out to all the haoles in phx!

Alright kids...here's the deal.  I'm a pretty big fan of Chipotle.  I grub on it in Tucson whenever I get the urge and this was my first shot at one in phx.  After watching one of my SGTs chow down on a burrito from "El Pollo Loco" I was JONESIN for a huge, badass burrito...gotta have me some Chipotle.  I just COULDN'T get it outta my head...  That's where I went wrong.  Sad to say, at this location, the burrito I received fell far short of my Chipotle Standard (oh yes, Ally has a Chipotle Standard...she is a silly monkey).  My rice was WAY undercooked, the guy behind the counter was rushing EVERYONE (update, dude, the line isn't that long...you can wait for ppl to tell the girl if they want rice on their burrito before you start the Inquisition focused on "sour cream?", "cheese?") and, although I know the portions are typically too large, my burrito was puny...puny, that is, by the Ally Chipotle Standard.    Most people would prolly see this as a blessing in disguise.  "Ally, your fat ass shouldn't be grubbin on a massive burrito"...I know, I say it to myself all the time.  But, here is the deal.  I LOVE my fat ass.  And my fat ass is a good American...I fucking paid for it, gimme what i WANT!  I had plans for the remains of the burrito I SHOULD have gotten.  I was gonna eat it til I got full and then sat around with the remains, watching Rome and slowly nibbling it into annihilation even tho I would be WAY too full after consuming it.  This was my plan.  Eh, I coulda even saved it for lunch if I had wanted...but who am I kidding...it's totally not as good the second day.  Point of the story, CHIPOTLE rocks, but this location...eh, not so much.

i love the army, but they make me wake up wicked early.  then i work, work, work and when lunch rolls around, me want tasty goodness FAST.  mamma mia's is the solution.  i got their 2 slice deal, mushrooms.  this cost me $4...that alone makes it rockstar, but you have to ask yourself...does it get any better?!  oh yes, it does!!!  the crust was crunchy, the cheese ooey-gooey and the mushrooms PLENTIFUL, which made me disgustingly happy.  i think pizza places never put enuf mushrooms...today, i met my match.  the joint is hoppin, but they still manage to get you out in about 10 minutes.  plus, you get to stare at frank sinatra while you wait (young, cute blue eyes, not the older, less attractive version) and listen to the tv blaring.  and if you are me, the QUEEN of movie trivia, you enjoy your wait as a time to school co-workers in "the Game" while you wait for your AWESOME slices.  moral of the story, go, young ones and enjoy.  the food is plentiful and cheap, atmosphere friendly but small.  its easy to miss...KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED!!!

let me set the scene for why i did NOT enjoy eating here.  up on mill ave for a nursing class on the weekend...with about 8 other girls...walked in after wandering aimlessly for the first 15 minutes of our 1 hour lunch break cuz we are all indecisive bitches...enter restaurant mexico.  we sat ourselves in the corner booth and almost walked right back out when we saw the sign that said "no split checks"...we prolly should have right then and there.  after being reassured that we would be able to pay separately, we decided to stay...then came the chips und salsa.  three chips in, i got a hair, A HAIR, in a chip.  ugh...way to start on the wrong goddamn foot.  took forever for our drinks to get there, food wasn't expensive, and was semi-tasty...i got the chicken taco & rice, it was good...except the BONE i got in my taco.  i was so super done with this place by the time we were ready to leave...but then we had to tackle the issue of trying to pay our ONE check w/ 9 cards...UGH.  overall, place wasn't half bad, it just got on my bad side with the hair/bone/check issues.  nothing worth writing home about and i would rather have wandered around longer...big, fat PASS on this one in the future.

imagine you have been on a long journey.  a LONG journey.  you have tromped down aisle after aisle, dodging children and carts, sidestepping around displays...you are tired.  exhausted...and hungry.  that trip through swedish furniture heaven has left you with a hunger you can't describe...but never fear...the ikea cafeteria is here!  the swedish meatball meal is fucking AWESOMENESS!  love, love, love it.  their potatoes rock, the lingonberry sauce is the shit and the gravy is seriously an orgasm in your mouth.  this meal is so good, i get it every time.  i munched on some of the salmon my hubby got...it was descent...but he made a mistake not getting the meatball goodness.  IF they have it, also try the lingonberry juice...the last two times i've gone, they didn't have it (sad, sad monkey), but when they do, i GULP that shit down!  it's badass.  i also dig the europe feel of the place...you clean up your own table, which i like.  5 stars for awesomeness-ness...especially cuz you get a workout right before you chow down.

When people talk about heaven on earth, be aware...they are discussing the Cornish Pasty Co.  This place is A-MA-ZING...oh yes, it must be sounded out.  I had friends in town from San Fransisco and they surfed Yelp to find a good place to eat in Phoenix...Cornish Pasty Co sounded awesome...and totally lived up to our expectations.  So much so that after eating there one night, we returned the night after for another round!  We sampled quite a few things from their menu...the Royale with Cheese was badass, the Chicken Alfredo pleasant, the Cajun wickedly delicious and spicy...and don't forget the Pilgrim, which is like having Thanksgiving bundled up and delivered to you in a wonderfully delicious pasty package.  AND the portions are big enough that you can eat half and be full, so the goodness can be enjoyed as a heated up lunch the next day!  BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!  We couldn't resist dessert...  Night One:  Banoffee Pie.  Thick layer of graham cracker, wickedly thick layer of RICH caramel, a spattering of banana slices and then fresh whipped cream.  FREAKIN AWESOME.  AND IT GETS EVEN BETTER!!!!  Night Two:  Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty.  Imagine amazing pastry smothered in chunky peanut butter, drizzled with raspberry jelly and encasing bananas...now top that with some more pastry, more jelly and whipped cream...not the sickening sweet shit that comes in cans...fresh, cool awesomeness disguised as a white blob.  THIS is the amazing Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty...God's gift to man.    My advice...SEEK OUT CORNISH PASTY CO, ALL YE FOOD LOVERS!!!  You will NOT be disappointed.

I was pretty pumped to check this place out...and was INCREDIBLY let down!  I'm up in Phoenix once a month with my National Guard unit and I love to try new places up here, so when one of my SGTs was headed to this place for lunch and invited me and another soldier along, we were in!  It sounded tasty and interesting...I'm always up for soup and sandwiches.  Looking at the menu, I was impressed.  Huge variety, interesting ingredients...sign me up.  We didn't have much time to decide and, as a perpetually indicicive individual, I decided to jump in and go for the first thing that sounded interesting/tasty.  Roasted sweet potato sandwich...AWESOME!  Here is where it starts to go downhill...after telling the girl behind the counter that it was my first time here and asking what I could get with my sandwich ("does it come with soup, chips, a drink?") I was told that I could have slaw or chips.  I went for a half sandwich and  the chips, even though my distaste for the available options was obvious.  THEN I asked for a cup of soup (cream of carrot...pretty tasty).  Does the girl behind the counter (who eventually turns out to be the manager) let me know that this place has a 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup combo?  Oh no!  She lets me pay more for something I didn't want in the first place...AFTER I asked if soup was an option as a side!  However, I did not discover this EGREGIOUS act until I witnessed the other soldier I had come with pay for her food and get this deal.  Let me say that I have worked in the food service industry and if I had heard a customer complaining as loudly as I was, I would have gotten my manager to have them fix the problem.  If I WAS the manager, I would have done something to make it right.  In this situation, nothing happened, even though the manager was RIGHT THERE.  And when I approached the counter to ASK for a manager, the MANAGER disappeared into the back, leaving me to question another employee.  Needless to say, I found the service deplorable and refuse to return to this establishment based soley up this fact.  The food?  Not good enough for how much I paid for it.  My sandwich was interesting, but not in the "MMM I can't get enough of this" kinda way.  I didn't finish it...too much "interesting" in one place.  The soup was pretty good.  The best part of my meal?  The cookie I paid $1.75 for...most expensive cookie I've ever had.  Overall rating..this meal was not worth the time, money or energy I spent ranting about it.

holla atcha baba ganoush!  omfg, LOVE this place.  i hadn't been before one of the soldiers i work with said she wanted some hummus & chicken.    "hummus?" says i.  "i shall venture out to retrieve this prize for you, if you will man my station for the duration of my investigation of this location."  anyway!  i went out to grab lunch for my co-workers in the lab.  as the reigning queen of indecision, i decided to get the mediterranean combo.  best decision of my LIFE...well...maybe weekend.  but STILL!  the baba ganoush is my new fave thing!  the hummus was AWEsome!  they gave me a whole pack o' pitas.  A PACK...they didn't even take them out of the bag.  HOLLA!  and i know this sounds weird, but the croquette things tasted like burritos i used to buy for like...a buck and microwave.  might sound gross, but in reality, i would eat those burritos everyday if they weren't disgustingly bad for me.  so BONUS!  i got hummus for another soldier, he LOVED it.  i heard that the gyro was to die for AND the hummus/chicken combo was DE-LI-CI-OUS.  gotta get it with the lime/cilantro hummus.  PLUS, i got all this for less than 40 bucks!  you'll see me here again, in a t-shirt that says "baba ganoush is my homie"

i had to take a crazy nursing class on mill ave two weekends in a row...i came, i saw, i wandered...i was somewhat disappointed...until i got to the tavern.  i was so impressed i came back two days in a row.  HOWEVER, wtf dude at the door?!  i was srsly INTERROGATED by this guy!  apparently i look nothing like my pic on my drivers license...i know, i know...i look like i'm still 16...but SRSLY?!  he asked my full name, date of birth and how old i was gonna be on my next birthday...then he carded my classmates who are in their 40s!!!  *sigh* apparently SOMEONE has trust issues...  anyway, day one, shared the appetizer sampler, which was tasty...the spinach artichoke dip was AWESOME.  day two, had the veggie wrap...super greasy, super cheesy, super packed with delicious veg...overall, super FREAKIN tasty!  wasn't too expensive, plus it's a great place to ppl watch if you sit on their patio.  got to see some srsly "cool kids"...yeah, it's hot to wear your pants around your knees, have holes in your ears big enuf to shove golf balls thru, ride your bike like a RETARD who tries to mow down pedestrians and...oh...yeah, be in your twenties and hang out with 14 year olds...yup...i'd do ya.

confession:  i have am srsly one of the more passive agressive ppl that i know.    sometimes it's problematic...an example of why this is a problem occurred while watching harry potter and the half blood prince at this theater.  the theater itself rates at about three stars...it's nothing special, charges  ridiculous amounts of money for popcorn and has only barely elevated "stadium" seating...but the service is great.  nice ppl, especially when they come in before the movie starts and give INSTRUCTIONS on how to be a POLITE movie-goer.  i'm sitting in the aisle that separates the "stadium seating" from the front, flat section.  it was the best seat available in a theater filled with obnoxious children and some crappy seating options.  i have had ppl walking past me, kicking my feet, shoving their strollers into me...i have a 3 year old sitting behind me, which is always a portent for trouble...i am not super happy at this point.  THEN, ppl wanna sit right next to me.  okay, i get it...i got a good seat and you wanna have one too.  check, i'm not greedy...have a seat.  quiet little old lady sits down.  THEN...THEY arrive.  (keep in mind that THEY arrived AFTER the "polite movie goer" speech.)  if i had known how THEY would be, i would have tripped THEM and repeatedly kicked THEM in the head while THEY were down, resulting in traumatic brain injuries and, hopefully, death.  or i would have just denied THEM the opportunity to sit next to me and ruin my entire harry potter experience.  THEY spoke in spanish to each other throughout the entire movie.    THEY had a phone which beeped obnoxiously every five minutes.  THEY brought in a plastic bag full of goodies.  these goodies include a super crinkly bag of chips, individually wrapped candies and cans (CANS!!!) of soda.  THEY got up repeatedly to walk to the bathroom, which meant that the plastic bag of goodies and beeping purse had to be transfered to and from the seat LOUDLY every time.  combine that with the GODDAMN, OBNOXIOUS, EVIL three year old behind me, constantly kicking the back of my chair and i wanted to punch someone in the FACE.  i was torn between THEM and the three year old.

My husband and I just got back from Berlin and on our way there, we had time to kill in Terminal 2 of the Sky Harbor.  THANK GOD we were in Terminal 2...with the badass Military & Veterans Hospitality Room!  My husband is Active Duty Army and I am in the National Guard, so this room was an option (sorry for you non-military types).  It's too easy...you sign in and they give you the tour.  There are couches, computers with internet, and a "library" where you can take books for your flight (you don't  even have to TRADE!).  There is also a room for "little kids" with toys and a TV,  a room for "big kids" with a TV, reclining seats and a dimmed setting.  Oh, and some tables to go along with the free grub and sodas..you got popcorn, gum..all kinds of nice little things.  The people here were friendly, the room is clean, cool and comfortable.  If you have a long lay over and are military, move yourself over to terminal 2 to hang out for a bit...they will be VERY happy to see you!

i was super impressed with this place.  never would have found it if a girlfriend who went to asu hadn't told me.  SO glad she did.  i got some awesome bbq chicken...i was tempted to get the bi bim bop, but i have korean roomies, so i had to try something i can't get in tucson.  i had the chicken which was TENDER and tasty.  the macaroni salad, which is the deciding factor on my ratings of plate lunch, was pretty damn ono!  i had the long rice, which was a lil bland, the cabbage, which was tasty and the cucumber kim chee, which is always a winner in my book.  the staff are wicked friendly and the food was SUPER tasty...next time i'm trying the garlic chicken.

mojo, you fro-yo mofo, i'd go homo for you-o!    i heart this place...especially cuz i get to SAMPLE!!!  i don't know why i even bought anything...i totally could have filled up on samples...i guess i couldn't have gotten the THIN MINT chunks tho!!!!  tried the pistachio (super sweet), mint (mint-TASTIC) and cappuccino (mmmmmmmmmm) w/ raspberries and thin mint chunks....SUPER TASTY...srsly, worth the money and it really wasn't THAT expensive.  ESPECIALLY cuz this fro-yo got me thru the rest of my day in my ridiculously long nursing class.    MOJO is the ROCKSTAR of the fro-yo world...i am now a mojo roadie!

dear toby, thanks for lunch.  love ya, man! ally  are you aware that as a member of the military, toby keith is willing to pay for my lunch at his restaurant?  heck yeah, my homie toby bought me a ROCKSTAR burger, fries and drink.  the whole meal was super tasty, simple but tasty...i got an assload of fries with my moist burger, toppings on the side.  i know it sounds silly, but toppings on the side makes me happy...it makes me feel like i am in control.  this pleases me.  i showed up here as the place opened, so my fellow soldiers and myself were seated quickly, brought our drinks (although, no sweet tea in a country singer's bar & grill?!  SRSLY?!  tsk tsk, toby), told about the free lunch deal and placed our orders.  food was out quick, no fuss and the waitress was on time with drink refills.  and although i'm not a huge fan of the outfits, my male companion was.  i mean, i don't particularly like to stuff my face while staring at borderline anorexic girls in cut off shorts so short they remind me of the sluts i hated in high school.  wear em if you are walking the streets, ladies, not if you are serving me my grub.

okay, okay, i admit it!  you got me!  i've been in az for a decade and have NEVER had a torta.  *hangs head in shame*  UNTIL THIS PLACE!  srsly, the asada torta is my new crack.  i am hooked on that shit like a fat kid on cupcakes.  big, gooey, chocolately, covered in sprinkles cupcakes.  you don't need the limes.  you don't need the uber-spicy green shit.  you just need The Torta.  it's soft, moist, got a lil kick and is PACKED with flavor.  honestly, you have to eat it to understand.  i got it two days in a row...that's how good it is.  yeah, now, after writing this, i think it's what i want for dinner.  fuck you, homemade chicken salad.  mama wants torta for dinner.

let me start by saying that two of my best friends (practically my sisters) are korean.  this means that i have a pretty high standard when it comes to korean fare.  i know that i can always count on some good grub when i stop in at thier house and, becuz of that, i have expectations when i walk into a "korean restaurant".  one of the officers that i work with said this place was great.  i'm thinkin the army didn't send him to korea.  i ordered the bi bim bop (to go...i hate eating in restaurants by myself) which is a personal fave and is different every place you go.  i have yet to find a place that does it better than my friend's oma, but this place wasn't even CLOSE to my standard.  first off, lemme say that i have never had bi bim bop served with an ASSLOAD of chopped lettuce and some other random green with a totally offputting taste (good for one bite, nauseating after that).  when i initially opened the container holding the bulk of my food i thought the girl had given me the wrong box...wtf, i didn't order a goddamn salad!  *sigh*  after pushing the masses of green shit aside i discovered my beef...what little of it there was to be found.  i felt like mrs. lovett on a quest to find some poor animals dying in the street to bulk up this meal(oh yeah...ally references musicals...get used to it).  it's kinda sad when you eat a big bowl of bi bim bop...of ANYTHING for that matter...and only end up with about five bites with meat.  it was almost like a scavenger hunt...which would be fun, if i wasn't hungry and craving the deliciousness of cow.  overall, my portion size was okay, once i threw out the green nonsense (it has no place being served with this meal) and mixed all of my shit MYSELF.  oh, and btw, korean resaurant, i know i'm white but that doesn't mean that i don't like kimchee...don't skimp on my sides, motherfuckers...it makes me cranky.  two stars for filling me up, even tho it was a total letdown.  *sigh*
