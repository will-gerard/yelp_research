the worse experience ever. we had a table for 10 and everything was wrong and a huge wait. we sat down with our drinks from the bar ordered more drinks and it took over 30 min to get the new ones only after going in twice to complain, the food was wrong the head of our party never even got her salad 2 hours later, they lied about the menu. the manager /owner would not even come talk to us. even after we asked multiple times to talk to him. we eventually walked out without paying and not one person said anything to us about it. the restaurant wasnt even busy.
