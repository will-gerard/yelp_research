The food here is great and the bread comes out as little squares of happiness. That is about it,   The staff seemed to be walking in a daze doing busy work. The place was VERY DEAD! There was about 5 waiters, a hostess a manager walking around and a full kitchen staff. They seemed busy but did not get anything done. It was pretty bad that they seemed like they were hiding any emotion and barely talked to each other. They displayed busy work at its finest.   There was a table of people behind us, and two other tables, and that was it. We were in there for almost 2 hours total. We spent most of the time watching the staff walking around from one end of the restaurant to the other with the same things in their hands appearing to look like defeated zombies.   Awesome food, and the bread was hot and fresh. But, the long time it took was unreal.

The store is very clean, and the staff is friendly. But this is the slowest moving Starbucks I have ever been to. Elect to wait around for at least 10 minutes with little to no line.

This is a modification of my original post. I came back here tonight against my will. BUT the staff and service did a total 180!!!   The waiter was very pleasant, I did not get my eye almost poked out and the staff seemed more engaged with the customers   Brandon was a rockstar and everything was perfect!!   Great job tonight!!    This would have been a 1 star but the main entry was pretty good. However the wait staff, and management needs some serious help.   We came to Outback to have a good family time, and the customer service blew that good time out of the water.   The waiter had a who cares attitude the whole time. I understand it was pretty busy when we got there, but there was absolutely no motivation, excitement, and seemed he did not care to even be there. I do not even remember him breaking a smile the entire time he talked to my table. The food was pretty good when we got it, and we had to wait around for another 10 more minutes for a kids bowl of mac n cheese...  When he is serving our plates, I had to move my head back to avoid his forearm in front of my face. Not even an excuse me, pardon me, or let me reach across. I am almost sniffing this dudes frickn armpit. I am starting to think that his important tasks in the back are clouding his better judgement for any kind of manners.   The waiter barely came around to check in or to see how things are going. I figured he had better things to do in the back, or must have been super exhausted from all of the people that were there.   With the food coming out late, a server that does not even smile, and barely checks up on his table. Things got funny when we try to order dessert!!  As we start talking about what is good on the desert menu, he is waving his arms and talking with a lot of animation. I get that, and do it myself at times. But if I have a pen in my hand... I will make sure that I am aware of where my hands are at to a customers face.   Then it gets better!!! I had to reach up to block the guy from getting carried away and poking my eye out. Then instead of saying sorry, or my bad, or anything else like that..... Instead the waiter gets pissed off about it, and acts like a total jerk. Oh and it gets better!!! When they came out with the shake I ordered, it was warm milk with a small scope of ice cream!! Seriously?   It gets better!!!!  I ask to speak with the manager, because I am thinking there is no point in talking to the waiter that is more interested in being in the back, and is acting like a total jerk at this point. When the manager comes over to our table she goes into full defense mode of her waiter, the staff for making my shake "the right way" because she saw them make it.   I am starting to wonder what they were doing in the back???? By this point I could care less what the manager had to say, or hearing her defend the waiter or the staff in the back... I seriously wonder what they were doing in the back!!   Then it gets even better, I told her that I did not want the shake, and it looked like milk with a scope of ice cream which is what it looked like. The whole table saw it, and we were all laughing because I must have upset him from not wanting my eye poked out?? She said she would take it off the bill (which we already paid for, so we were not expecting a free meal). Without us realizing it, the waiter double charged my order... I am seriously wondering what was taking up all of his time in the back??   I seriously doubt I will go back to this Outback. There is one off of the 17 that has better servers. Heck, even with my recent business trip to Pittsburgh the Outback over there was 5 stars all around. Don't waste your time with this Outback if you expect to have good customer service, and a manager that does not try to blow smoke up your backside because her employees are screwing up.

The staff is awesome, and you could not ask for friendlier people.   However, I have been coming to this place for about four years. The food quality has been steadily going down hill. The wings and portions are getting smaller and more expensive. The quality of the wings rates to barely edible.   This place needs to get another food vendor, because the quality is horrible. Then retrain the staff to get the order right. The last time I went there, the food was overcooked to the point the meat was dehydrated, greasy, and made my stomach sore for a few days.   The ambiance, and the staff are great. The management needs to get a better food vendor, and have his people step it up in the kitchen.

I came out here on a business trip from AZ. This is a great place, the staff was awesome, the food was prepared and brought out with perfection. As soon as I walked in the door I could tell this was a local family hang out. I seen a mix of all ages here.

This place was awesome. The staff was friendly and pleasant to talk to. Everything about this place  was on point!! We came out here from AZ, and got to sit by the window over looking the Pittsburgh skyline, and all of the snow on the ground (something not seen in Phoenix).

This is a great dive bar that is very laid back and easy going. The staff is great and the people are super friendly. The bar food is awesome and is priced really good. There are a couple of pool tables, video machines and dart boards. The music is at a level that is just right.

So I come here on the weekend to get an oil change and a car wash.. I have a new car and the guy was trying to upsell me on synthetic oil starting at $70.. So forget that, if I am going to pay that much I would rather go to the dealer.   It was convenient to have the gas pump ready before I get my car wash. The last I knew the attendants were supposed to pump. There were two guys standing there looking at each other, looked at me then just got a blank stare and did not do anything. Who cares, I pump my own gas. After pumping my own gas, I swear I was waiting around for about 10 minutes while the ONE guy working was done with another customer talking his ear off.   As I am reading these reviews, it is apparent there is a lack of fundamental leadership. Even if I am getting upsold by some HS kid, or they are trying to hustle for more car washes (repeat business). They could at least try to have some customer service skills, and teach their employees to take care of the customer.

This place does a great job for standard car washes and light cleaning. When it comes to up selling these guys are total jerks. But, if you want to see total unprofessional conduct, up sell hype, and people being total jerks. Come in with a ding or scratch or light crack, or blemish on your windshield. These people will turn into total a crazed meth head looking for a hit!! How many times does it take for them to walk away???? Who knows, you literally have to walk away and hear the hackling from some jerk demanding your insurance information and saying you will get a free car wash.  They do great work for car washes, but their up selling and unprofessionalism towards their customers is unreal.

I have been using this place for over a year. They are really fast, and most everything is done in house. There was a small hichup when they switched to the bar  code system, but everything has been great over all. I would recommend this place to anyone.

This place is pretty good, the coffee is good and it is a very laid back environment. I think they try to hard to make it a upscale / preppy place. The staff is very friendly.

Of course it is crowded on a Friday night. We sit at the bar instead of waiting 30+ minutes. The bar tender Jason was a rock star behind the bar. He was able to take orders, prepare drinks, answer staff and patrons questions without missing a beat. Awesome time and if you go to the bar ask for Jason.

I am not coming back to this place. I am a HUGE fan of Dunkin' Donuts, and have been for a very long time. But this place sucks! The donuts look like a crumbly mess, taste stale, and there is barely any chocolate on them.   I went there this morning, and they had my order 100% messed up. I got the wrong drink, which I can understand happens and I pointed it out. I get my box of donuts and drive home, it is the wrong order as well.   Don't waste your time with this place, the other negative reviews are 100% accurate and display a high level of a "who cares" attitude by the staff.

This place is a 5+ the concept is different and very unique. If someone says they have bad or stale donuts hen they are smoking something. If you want a donut with a twist then this is the place to go!!
