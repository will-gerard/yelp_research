I am an insurance agent, and I send ALL my glass repair/replacements to Desert Breeze Glass! I have never had an issue with them except POSITIVE ones!  When my clients contact me after their appointment and tell me how great and nice and prompt Desert Breeze Glass was, that's all I need to know to keep sending them all my work.

Went here today, I ordered TWO subs, they screwed up  4 times, so i walked out.  How do you screw up when you make it as i stand right there?  In your quest for speed, you get the orders wrong, slow your happy asses down and get the order CORRECT, thats not asking too much......

The waitress sucked. Very slow. Inattentive when they were slow. The food wasn't good. Strippers over fried. The manager was over and answered a question about the chicken and was rather arguementative and she literally said.... The place we get the chicken from sometimes sends wings out to us with feathers still on it. Just ruined our appetites.. 2 people left after eatting and their stomachs  were upset. Been to this location several  times. Never again

AWESOME job performed by PRK!  My truck wouldn't start...They had it towed in and discovered the fuel pump and module went out, generally, and easy fix, but they went the extra mile and discovered there was a bad wire that caused the module to burn out.....I highly doubt anyone else would have found the main issue, a bad wire....  These guys are the best!
