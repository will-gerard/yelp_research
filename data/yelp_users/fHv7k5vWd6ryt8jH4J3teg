I have heard a lot of great things about this place... I must say I was let down once I stopped in to visit. The music was really low and it really wasn't dim enough on the inside. It was like a Victoria Secret runway show gone horribly wrong. I witnessed a drunk stripper trip over her own feet twice and the second time took out a customer sitting in his chair. I couldn't tell if he was happy or upset about it??  I seriously thought I was at some autistic circus or something no joke!  It's cool that they serve unlimited popcorn, that was a new one for me for a strip club, or else I don't go to a lot of them. Haha  The drinks were a little over priced as well. I was told this was one of the better entertainment clubs in the valley. You can bet your bottom dollar, next time I see that person I am going to give them an ear full!   Sorry Bourbon Street... But I will probably never the visit you again in my life, no offense.

Wow!! Really?? Had to wait 6 hours to get checked into the emergency! This place is a joke! And when you ask how much longer it's going to be, all they respond with is, "You're next." last time I come to this hospital that's for sure.

One of my favorite places to eat here in the valley! Great tasting Mexican food! This place has a very homey authentic feel to it.   I used to come here once a week for my business meetings with Mona Vie. The place has a lot of room and is great for large parties. Our group of people always have a great time here. The staff are very friendly and pay close attention to your requests. I would definitely call for a reservation if you plan to have a group larger than 4 or 5 people. This place can getting a little busy during the usually dinner rush. Just a word of advise for you.    Last time I ate here I tried the chicken enchiladas they were amazing! I had a Margarita also very good.   I definitely recommend visiting this place if you're looking for a great Mexican food themed restaurant.

These guys are great! The store Manager Ty Craig is truly an asset that Discount tire could never afford the lose! They will bend over backward to take care of you here, and do more. Great location and the wait is never that long. Talk about a "well oiled" machine!!

Great Place to get out and let loose! I have only been here on a Wednesday night during their ladies night $0.25 bottle special. I have had a blast every time! It's an interesting mix between Country Music and Hip Hop.. Dance floor is right smack in the middle of the place, which it really cool. There are 5 bars you can order from and waitresses roaming around taking drink orders as well. This Place really knows how to pack a lot people in and keep it entertaining for everyone! I give this place 5 stars!!

This place has always been my favorite! I have been coming here on and off for the last 5 years! I really miss the original DJ that used to be here, he always made it fun! Really don't see some of the old faces that I used to anymore either... Guess times change and people move on..  I can respect the fact that this bar is able to heard a ton of people in on Wednesday nights for ladies night! I guess they can give thanks to reputation for that! I mean who would want to see groups of pretty cowgirls, while getting the opportunity to have a ice cold beer for only 50 cents??! Wednesdays is usually always a fantastic time here!!  Ok... Lets move on back to the DJ.. When you announce, "if you have a request let the DJ know." Make sure you play the damn song! I don't know how many times I have tried to help the DJ put some flare into is performance, and then they never follow through.. His loss not mine. No offense but I have been to more country bars then Miley Cyrus's father, and I have seen more a** than a toilet seat.. I think I know by now what would make the speakers go, "BOOM BOOM!"   FireBall lovers... On a good note.. Fireball shots are only $3 on Wednesdays night! More the reason to visit this place for Ladies night!   I didn't want it to come to this topic... But Fellas... If you're going to have a wet T-Shirt contest.. Make sure the ladies you select or shall I say sign up, are present able! I understand the demographic area is horrible but, please have some sort of criteria without sacrificing legalities of discrimination! Besides.. The Wet T-Shirst contest is getting old! Perhaps you should invest into a stripper pole, that retracts in the middle of the dance floor and have pole contest... Take my word for it you would have a niche on all these other country bars that are stealing not only your lighting but, also your thunder! Just food for thought really! Hint hint...  Other than that.. Keep up the good work! Really appreciate the friendly staff!   See you guys next time I see you! :)

I GOT MY TIE CUT HERE!!!  I really enjoy the idea of wearing a tie to this place just to have it cut off your neck! Me and a buddy of mine, paid this place a visit wearing our ties. Now going to lie.. I was a little nervous since I've never had someone cut a tie off me before. Very entertaining I have to say it was!  Whats crazy is... We are definitely not the first ones to get our ties cut. This place hangs all the ties they cut to the ceiling. They must have thousands or ties hanging from their ceiling. Amazing to see!  The food here is stupidly great! I ordered the rib eye steak medium. They cooked it to perfection! Probably one of the best tasting steaks I've ever had!  This place obviously has a great atmosphere, given the whole country bar vibe, and ties hanging from the ceilings. It's very big too. Lots of room for huge parties. The patio itself can entertain a couple hundred people.   If you have never visited this place for a nice meal... You better put it on your bucket list. Believe me... IT"S WORTH IT!!    DON'T FORGET TO WEAR A TIE!!!

I have been coming here for the last 11 years! You really cannot go wrong on the menu.   I usually order the baja chicken chimichanga. Very very delicious! And it also comes with rice and beans!  Speaking of Baja... The baja sauce they have here is epic!! I have been trying to recreate it at home and I've failed EVERY time! Ugh!! I usually get a side of this deliciousness of a sauce for dipping my chips in.  I really love the atmosphere at this location. Especially since they have a starry night room. Where they have installed fiber optics into the ceiling to give the appearance of stars above you! You really have to check this place out, just to experience it!  This place can get rather busy on the weekend nights, so I suggest getting there some what early, unless you don't mind a short wait.   Okay... Now on to my favorite topic for this restaurant... The Margaritas.. You have to try the ultimate margarita here at least once in your life! After putting about 4 of these puppies down, I feel like a million dollars!  I cannot wait to visit this place again for a good time, and great food!

I usually get my hair cut by my stylist lady who I have been going to the last 6 years.. She was unavailable so I decided to give this place a try. Christine cut my hair and did a fantastic job. She is very nice and extremely easy on the eyes! ;-) I will probably be paying her a visit again in the future!

Lots of fun for the whole family! This zoo is great! I didn't expect it to have as much as it did. I was more than amazed with the cool aquarium they have.  ' I brought my five year old daughter here, and she was extremely entertained with all that they had. She really liked the monkeys, and the sting ray's. Petting the baby sting rays was a big hit for her.   I liked to see the tigers, and lions the most. The turtles were really cool too.   We didn't try any of the food here this time cause we where in a little bit of a rush and it seem packed with a lot of people. I will have to plan on eating here next time I visit.   What a great experience for my daughter and I!

Love me some Red Lobster! I heard a rumor that Red Lobster will be shutting done across the valley. I can't understand why... This place is unlike any other.   Red Lobster had been the trademark for affordable seafood experience for as long as I can remember. I can't imagine not having them around anymore. Once I heard this horrific and frightening news, I decided to march on over to my local Red Lobster is get my fix of seafood craving while I still can. I forgot how much I adore this place so much I actually came twice in a row back to back nights, and ordered the same dish! Wowzers!!   I started out with some appetizers coconut shrimp and lobster stuffed mushrooms. These were a perfect start to a wonderful seafood experience.  The bread biscuits that come with your beverages are unbelievable! I couldn't stop hoovering them down, they are so good! HAHA...  For my main course I went with the Ultimate Feast. Which comes with delicious Shrimp scampi, a bundle of snow crab legs, a handful of fried shrimp, and an adequately sized lobster tail. My sides where mashed potatoes, and a side salad. Wow a lot of food for under $30!  After all this deliciousness I was fully satisfied and ready for bed. haha The waiter asked if dessert was on my mind, I said absolutely not!   Like I said... I was so happy to be here that I decided to visit again the very next day! Please don't close Red Lobsters!!

Well you would usually find me getting my hair done at sport clips, however I thought I would try something different. I was recommended by a friend to go to Amanda Banovac at pure elements and she is wonderful! Full of energy and very talented at what she does. I would recommend calling and scheduling an appointment because she books up fast. She really does help out the community by having people leave with a smile and regain confidence just by the fantastic work she does with hair! I will definitely be back no question about it!

Amazing talent! I have been hearing a lot about this hairstylist that works here. She does several of my acquaintances' hair. The crazy party is I meet someone everyday that either goes to her or knows someone that does!   So I decide to cheat on my usual spot sport clips and give Brittany Winman a shot.. The cool part is that I have been to the hair salon she works at in the past. Pure Elements so I was delighted to hear that she was located there.   Needless to say I was impressed not just by the skill set she possesses as a hairstylist, but also her character. What a rare and kind hearted human being! I can see why a lot of ladies and gentlemen flauk to her for hair essentials and necessities. She shared with me that she acquires 3-5 new clients a week. That's awesome if you think about it. If you decide to seek her services, an appointment is required for sure.     The salon is very high end and elegant. The atmosphere inside makes you feel the presence of royalty. They are a full service salon offering all services for hair, nails, makeup, and massage. If you have not already visited this place I absolutely insist that you put it on your bucket-list, and while you're there say hello to Brittany!

Buca di Beppo will fill you up!  I have always been a huge fan of Bucca. The atmosphere in these restaurants are very fun and support the theme they are trying to represent. I really love how they tour you through the kitchen on your first visit. Very classy and old school Italian vibe.  I can here with a friend for dinner. I remember I was starving when I arrived here, and couldn't wait to eat! The service here was outstanding! Our waiter Samantha took very great care of us, making sure we had full beverages and if we needed anything additional.   The menu has a fine selection of pastas, entrees, and great dessert dishes.  I ordered a pasta dish a la carte, I did the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. Also ordered the cheese bread with it. The Alfredo sauce was very delicious with a sweat flavor to it.   Next time I visit this place I am going to try their spaghetti dish, and also try a glass of their wines.   Such a great experience coming here, and I truly do recommend it!

Great Atmosphere here!  If you like fine dinning with your Mexican food, you'll love this place!  You'll be greeted by a host or hostess once you walk in. This place has a really nice theme and great style of culture.  You get chips and salsa once you are seated which is really cool. There is three different kinds of salsa with the chips. I really like the green colored one!   I ordered an ultimate margarita on the rock without salt... The Margaritas here are really good! After about three of the ultimate one, I started to feel really good! Have to love the liquid courage! HAHA  Off the menu you I ordered the mini chimis, the beef ones. The meet was very delicious, and the sides were very nicely arranged.   My overall experience here was really good! Next time I return here, I think I'll try the beergartita, and the enchiladas.

Holy cow these guys are more than great!!  So I have tried literally four different garage door company's in the past. I always seem to run into some kind of bad luck with these company's either they rip me off, do a half ass job, or just flat out not good at anything they do... Well maybe fith time is a charm... I was referred to Smokeys Garage Door repair, and I would just like to start off by thanking them for being patient with me!  These guys are truly amazing! They are too notch experts when it comes to repairing/ replacing garage doors. Just buy how knowledgable they came off gave my comfort and satisfaction that I was in not just good but great hands!  They were in and out with a job that would have taken any other competitor hours. Wow!! Still can't get over how professional they were with me through the whole process..  Thank you so much again Smokeys! I really love my new 8355 belt drive lift master!

Are you kidding me???!! The lady at the drive through here didn't want to hand me my drink until I handed her my card! HAHA really??!! My girlfriend was fumbling through her purse to find the debit card and I tried to reach for the drink she was handing me out of the drive through window and she immediately pulled the drink back and said, " um... How about you pay me first." Do I look that untrustworthy? Talk about making a customer feel low! I guess she thought I was going to drive off with a fountain drink and leave the rest of the order... What a joke!

What a great little dive bar!  This place is really cool for a small little dive bar. The staff here are awesome!   I love the atmosphere here. The place is located just north of bell rd on 28th ave.   The drinks are really cheap here, which is always a cool thing. haha I came here on a sunday afternoon to watch football. The place has plenty of televisions if you like watching sports. They also have pool tables and darts.   If you like Dive bard in the north phoenix area, you really need to check this place out!

Found my new hair cut spot!  I have always been a huge fan of the Sport Clips chain! However this location is remarkable! These ladies in here are absolutely wonderful!   The place is deigned with a cool layout that I havn't seen in a sport clips. I love the seating arrangement for those who are waiting to get serviced.   The wait is never really that longer here either, which is always a nice thing. I believe thats because they know how to schedule their staff.   I will be visiting this place again for sure in the next couple weeks!

Very cozy little wine bar!  The atmosphere here is very dimmed lighting with great live music. I came here with a group of friends, and had not idea it was here. Very cool vibe I got from being here. Everyone looked like they were having a blast. I espcially liked how it felt as if you were entering through a back door enterance, which was actually the front door.   The wine menu here is very good! Tried a couple cabs and we ordered the infamous "Chopped Salad" I need to get this off my chest right now and simply say, "HOLY S*** THAT SALAD WAS UNBELIEVABLE!" You must order this salad if you ever visit this place in the future.  Very very cool place, and I will be visiting again for the chopped salad for sure!

Great fun place to be!   The atmosphere here is awesome! very cool divey country western feel. I came here with some friends for drinks and country dancing. It's quite a drive when your coming from the west side of town. This place is located in the town of crave creek, which seems like it's in the middle of no where. ha ha   The place seem really big on the inside. The dance for was kind of small and I wish they had more restrooms.   We came here on a Saturday night, It was really busy, and lot of people were on the dance floor getting their two step on. They had a live band that sounds really good. Not much for drink speicals though. If you plan on drinking a lot you might want to plan on spending some extra mula.   Very fun place here, great from groups and events.

Great Experience!  I always have a great time when I go to a Diamond Backs game here.   This place is huge, and offers comfortable seating. They have restaurants and bars spread all around this place which is really nice!  I also like the fact that it doesn't take long to find a bathroom, and they are never over crowded.   What I really love about watching base ball here is that they are marquees all over the place that show statistics during the game! The main screen is huge and has a great picture.   I can't wait to go to another Diamond Backs game!!

If you like German Beer/ Food or even German culture, you have got to try this place out! Many people don't realize what this place is, or even that it is located in Las Vegas just off the strip.   I took my girlfriend here to experience some fun German music and culture. The steins of beer are where it's at! The Beer is imported straight from Germany and the food is absolutely amazing! I ordered the hefewiezen from munchen. It was delicious and it's served in a true stein! The food is pretty good, I ordered the bratwurst plate.   The entertainment here can get a little wild and crazy! haha which makes the whole experience worth it. I really like the beer stein holding challenges they do here. Pretty fun to watch.   We had a lot of fun here, and cannot wait to re-visit this place. I absilutely recommed this place if your visiting the Las Vegas area.

This place has a great feel once you first walk in their door. The fish tank is really cool too! The fish seem exotic or something? Really, really neat. The place is not very big in size, which gives it that intimate dive restaurant feel. The courtyard/ patio in the front would be great for a group if you looking for a little more room.  This place is right in the heart of old town Glendale. Parking was not an issue at all when I went for lunch time. I parked in the thrift store parking then walked over. Seemed like a few others were doing the same thing as I noticed pulling up to the restaurant.   Once I got sat I noticed the menu was mostly in Vietnamese and had English translation as well. I wasn't sure what to order, as it was my very first time being here, or even to a Vietnamese restaurant for that matter. The server recommended the Pho, and a eves dropping customer also insisted that I try the Pho.   So I ordered the Beef and Shrimp Pho, along with some fresh spring rolls and  a Coors Light to drink. The Spring rolls where very different than what I was used to. They were extremely fresh wrapped in a weird film like texture of some sort. It was very delicious! The dipping sauce that comes with the rolls is perfect for the rolls. They bring out all the add in for the pho before the bowl of broth arrives. The add in consist of mint, cilantro, lemon, jalapenos, and some type of sprout root. Once I tried the Pho, I was blown away by out great it all was! It was actually really exciting and fun eating Pho since it was my first time. I can now see why everyone keeps recommending the Pho here!  What a great experience! I cannot wait to return here again.

This place will always have a small place in my heart! I have been coming here for over 20 years, and they have been more consistant of that period of time than any place i know. Amazing!  I usually come up here a lot during football season to watch the games on Sunday. They have some pretty cool specials all day and have a ton of TVs throughout the place, which makes it way easier to stay caught up on the different games.   The food is actually really good here. I usually get the ground beef burrito enchilada styles with the sour cream, cheese, and guacamole on the I side. Can't go wrong with it. It's so damn delicious! The chips and salsa are addicting in so many ways. Haha if you like to drink alcohol they usually have specials on select draft beers, margaritas, and bloody Mary's.   I really so enjoy paying this place a visit even know it's usually a few time every year. But it's comforting to know that this place hasn't changed and it's remains amazingly consistent.

The bartender is a psychic!! Or perhaps I just come in here too often! haha  I usually come into this location on Tuesday nights after work for the wings special. They offer 60 cent wings (Bone-In or Boneless) on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I like this location a lot because it right on my way home from work. They are located just west of Dysart Rd on McDowell Rd. on the south side of McDowell Rd.   When I come in here I usually set at the bar. Gabe the bartender, is a pretty cool guy. We've had our conversations of humor and gossip.   When I come here I order the same thing every time. Which is a tall ice cold Coors Light draft with an order of 12 spicy garlic traditional (Bone-In) wings. The spicy garlic sauce is absolutely amazing! I also like the Buffalo rub as well, but usually stay consistent with getting the spicy garlic. I would also recommend the fried pickles here! Probably the best fried pickles I have ever had at a restaurant!  This place pretty big, and in the bar area they have a lot of TV's to watch fights and sporting events, which is always cool! I usually see kids here all the time, so I would assume its great for kids, and they offer kids their own menu to order from.   I am curious to see if these guys' business will be affected or not, with the new location opening up in the Westgate plaza.

Man... I can see why they call this place Heffer-Bay! Good God!! Well I did have a lot of fun and also paid a lot for drinks. I think this place would do a lot better if they got rid of the cover charge and had better drink specials. Come on guys you are not in Scottsdale. There is not reason to charge a cover, especially given the face the scenery is horrible and the ave age range is between 35-60. I felt as if they put the scraps of Blue Martini into a place like Chilie Bombers. I know where to suggest my grandmother to go to pick up on people her age. HORRIBLE!!!

This is my daily stop!  I really love this QT. These guys in my oppinon are the flag ship for all QT stores! They seem to have a well oiled machine here!   You never have to wait too long at all... Matter of fact I don't even think I ever had to wait in a line to check out here! They has some type of team-work system going that I have never seen at a convenient store!  As we all know pretty mush every QT is laied out the same for the most part. These guy stay up on making sure the hot food is well monitored. I have yet to see over cooked food on their hot food grill.   They are educated when it comes to prodect knowledge! Couple time I went to pay for something, not knowing I could get another item for a discounted price or even for free. WOW!!   I want these guys to be noticed for all the hard work they are doing here at this place!   GREAT JOB!!

Well I have always been a fan of Pei Wei chains... Except this location made me uneasy! My guest and I literally waited 29 minutes to receive out meals. The most annoying feeling in the world is waiting for your food when you're starving, while seeing other individuals who arrived/ ordered after you enjoy their meal first! When i complained to the staff asking them if they had lost my order. All they wanted to do was argue with me about how long I have been waiting! Guess they forgot to realize the receipt has the time of order on it! 29 MINUTES and 8 MINUTES is a big gap!! Ugh!!! I don't know about you but I am not a fan of eating while I am unhappy. I will NEVER come to this Pei Wei again!! I'll make sure at least 7 other people know about my experience here as well!

Geez talk about bad service! We took some ink cartridges back to recycle them and we were treated very horribly! Whydto they call the customer service station "customer service"?? They obviously don't live up to their title. I was starting to loose it when we were skipped in line and ignored, all because an employee didn't want to bother with taking a couple boxes of used ink cartridges. Sorry Staples... Office Max will now have my business!

This place is huge on the inside! I think they have just about everything you can think of in here! I only wish they had more stuff in english so I don't have to look like a chicken with his head cut off, running around the store looking for different things! Haha  I was pretty impressed with the variety of European foods. However customer service is just horrible at its best here!  To be perfectly honest I would much rather shop at Lee Lees than this place. At least at lee lees they actually try to help you by providing great customer service.   I am not quite sure if I'll be visiting this place again... I would rather order from the Mcdonald dollar menu than come back here! So I give this establishment 2 stars and nothing more!

They always seem to be out of everything that I need. I like you use the got to be glue hair gel and they never have it in stock. Also I was looking for mini travel size bottles for liquids and they have not had them in stock for a while. It's just frustrating to me, because this is walmart... That kind of stuff shouldn't happen. I would like to see more check out stations open up when 15-20 ppl and waiting in two lines.

This McDonalds is pretty great when I get hungry at Walmart. It's kind of weird when you order to go they give you the food you order in a plastic bag. They always seem to be out of products. They tells me someone is not preparing correctly. Failing to plan is planning to fail.

This wells Fargo is inside Frys Food store. If you want to wait forever in line, this would be your bank! They need to hire more tellers! And learn how to expedite their services.

This place is great!  The staff here is very nice and professional! They helped me pick my selection, my first time visiting here.   The food tastes absolutely amazing! I cannot believe the amount of selections they have on their menu. I tried the Orange flavored chicken entree and it was very delicious. The meal comes with quite a bit of food too!   This place is conveniently located on the south west corner of Brown Rd and Power Rd.   The atmosphere is some what contemporary, with a little oriental touch. I love it!  I cannot wait to come here again, I think I'll try the Mongolian Beef entree next time!

These guys make you feel extremely comfortable when purchasing a vehicle! Integrity and service are top notch. Kent was my salesman and he offered a plethora of product knowledge, and he was just an interested person all the way around! Inside they offer unlimited food and drinks at their food and beverage bar. While your vehicle is being delivered you can enjoy putt putt golf with their indoor putting green! If you're in the marked for a new vehicle, I encourage you to stop in and see Arrowhead Lexus! They have several dealerships across the valley.

I love this tanning salon! They have great beds and offer awesome products! I used the extreme bed which is a stand up bed and I can honestly say, "there is no bed that beats that one!" Some of my friends have tried their spray tanning and they really like the products they offer.

Probably the best tanning salon in the north valley!   I cannot express enough how awesome this place is! They have everything you need when it comes to getting your tan on all over one roof! They also have a hair salon inside as well. What a great idea. Get your tan and hair done in one location! Brilliant! Very sleek and hip atmosphere, they have all kinds of cool newer model beds. From stand up bass to lay down and even leg tanners! There extreme stand up bed is my favorite! All you really need is 5 minutes and your good to go with that one! I love it, like a fat kid loves cake!!  When it comes to general knowledge and safety using the UV beds Darrel and Diane really know their stuff. Every time I am in there. I see them expressing the urgency of how to safely tan to avoid injury or over exposure. After listening to them talking about the details of tanning and how it reacts to individuals differently, I see there really is a science to keeping a great time and healthy skin in the future. I will "piggy back my days" Darrel! Thanks for the cool helpful advice. I have noticed my tan getting better and my skin is starting to hold the moisture now!   If you are ever in the area, stop in the check this place out! You will be amazed! Say hello to Darrel and Diane while you're there!   Cheers!

Red Robin does not dazzle me... Service is always poor. Drink refills take a long time, and when you ask for fries to come out before your food the staff just seem very annoyed and when you finally get the fries there only a few in the basket. Trust me there are better places with better service.

If you really want quality service at an affordable price these guys are your go to people. Family owned and operated business here, where you can FEEL the integrity from the staff, and owners as they will bend over back wards to ensure you are not only well taken care of, but most importantly SAFE when putting you back on the road!   The knowledge they obtain about their product is quite impressive I might add. If you're looking for a great place to get your regular maintance done they do it all here! Oil Changes to suspensions work.   I recently brought my vehicle here for a alignment service and I was pleased after visiting two other alighnment shops someone actually got it right. Thank you guys for all your hard work. You are a true blessing to this community!

This place was pretty good! I like the concept of paying for your meal before you start piling on your selections. Make it convenient to leave right after you finish you meal.  The prices was pretty good, you have the option of selecting either a small or large which comes with a fountain drink.   The meats and other selections seemed very fresh and appetizing. I loved how the staff are willing to throw together a concoction of sauces and spices to add flavor to your dish!    All in all this was a fun experience and the food was very delicous! I would recommened this place.

What a joke!! If anyone ever asks me to attend this club again! I will kindly show you a sarcastic smile, while giving you the middle finger and walk away!! This place is like a crammed hallway! ALL DUDES!!! It seriously is a waste of time. You literally have to push yourself through a wall of people that are shoulder to shoulder to get anywhere! I am not even sure if the Fire Marshall would be pleased with the occupancy of the place. This place smells like Body Oder and Vomit. Both make sense giving the fact I seem someone blow chunks in a packed crowd! That was really the only entertainment I saw at this place!

Never really been a huge fan of Hell's Half Acre... Probably in my opinion it's just not the right fit for the west gate experience simply put. When I think of this place I think of Hot Topic in the mall. Very congested with all kinds of crap and Gothic! I expect individuals with pale make up and piercings to be lingering around this joint. The coolest part about this bar would have to be the free lance hot dog stand... I know.. Sad!

This place was not my favorite sushi spot to go to... It definitely was not what I was expecting at all when it comes to atmosphere and experience. I came here for the happy hour and was not impressed at all with the menu selection they offered for the happy hour. I was meeting a friend here, as we both were not this this place and wanted to give it a shot. To be honest I will probably never return. They didn't do anything wrong, I just did not feel what they offer here was what I was looking for. Lack of a better words I didn't feel my sushi spot needs were fulfilled in the slightest bit. I ended up going with a saki bomber to drinking, and a couple over priced rolls, which were the Philly Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll. Food was okay, but something was just off for me.

I really enjoy coming to this Harkins. The Park West plaza is nicely put together, what I mean by that is the parking and layout. Parking is never an issue for me here, and it's never over crowded.   This facility is relatively new, and the atmosphere/ design is really cool.  I guess really the main reason I come to this location, is the simple fact that it doesn't get too crowded.

This hooters is cool. Its upstairs on Mill Ave. I gotta say that I didn't see one non-attractive hooters girl there. I was very please with the scenery, and the prompt service i received. I can bet this Hooters location does extremely well. Good Works girls and guys!!

TRY THE MONKEY BALLS ROLL!!  This place is really good! They have a great happy hour menus for food and drinks!   The atmosphere is somewhat dark, yet appropriate for the culture they are trying to express. I came here is a friend, and we both thought the rolls on the happy hour menu were very reasonably priced.   I tried the Monkey Balls Roll. It was absolutely amazing! Its made with mushrooms and salmon and some other stuff then it's deep fried into a great deliciousness.  I also ordered a saki bomber, which was also on happy hour. All in all this place was actually pretty cool. I would like to come back here and grab the monkey balls off the happy hour menu!

Really like the Babbo chains a lot! Especially this location since its in my area. I have tried a couple dished at this restaurant. My favorite is the garlic chicken pasta for sure! I've also tried the cheese manicoti, which was very delicious as well. Tuesdays I used to come here for the spaghetti and meatball special. I am not sure if they still do that or not. However it used to be the highlight of my Tuesday nights.   The atmosphere is very settle and calm. It has a really nice authentic Italian feel to it. When you get seated they will bring out this amazing bread and vinegar/ old for dipping. I can't wait to visit this spot again for the garlic chicken pasta my fav!

Best Orange Chicken Ever!!!  Zushi has an amazing lunch menu, that offers many selections to choose from. They offer happy hour prices pretty much all day! That's something that you don't see all the time.   The place is pretty quite during lunch hours. So if you're looking for some peace and quite, or looking for a good spot for a business meeting this place would be good for you. They have a pretty large bar seating area with TV's to watch sports or what not. The lounge area is quite large also which offers more of the restaurant style seating.  I came here for lunch and ordered the Bento Box with Orange Chicken. Let me just say... Probably the best... No wait correction.... THE BEST Orange Chicken I have ever had in MY LIFE!! I could not believe the sensation my taste buds were going through! The texture, flavor, smell, and spice all joined together for an amazing delicious delight! To give you a better idea , and proof that I am not over exaggerating... I came here the very next day for lunch and order the very same thing! The Bento Box also comes with a side salad, rice (you get the choice to have fried rice for an extra cost), and an egg roll with delicious tangy sweet and sour sauce. Best part of all... It's only $6.95  This place is located on the south west corner of Power Rd. and McDowell Rd. in Mesa.   The staff here are very polite and professional. I spoke with Meng, who also served me. She was very knowledgeable when it came to explaining anything I didn't understand from the menu.   I think next time I visit here I will try to order something other than the amazing Orange Chicken. It's definitely going to be a challenge! Mongolian Beef may be my next venture!

Happy New Year!!! Goodbye 2013!!!  I came here for the last 30 minutes of 2013 to do a champagne toast with my date, brother, and friends. I am glad I made the trip to this very exquisite establishment. Very elegant and ritzy feel here. Now I see why Fleming's is held on such a high pedestal for so many. The place is amazing for the simple fact that you feel important and worthy while you're within their walls. Cool way to welcome the new year!  We did not have anything off the food menu. Only came to do a champagne toast and left once the ball dropped.  I cannot wait to come visit this fine dinning place again!

The Yard House is always a great spot to visit while in the Westgate Plaza. I am a big fan of the business and what they have to offer for service. I mean come on... How many place have you been to where they have more than 100 different beers on tap?!?! This place have amazing beers, that's a given! HAHA The food here is very very good. I can never get enough of this place.   The atmosphere is very up scale and trendy. The bar area has plenty of televisions if your looking to catch the game for a drink with some friends. The dinning area is dimmed in lighting with plenty of room for small or large groups, offering table or large booth seating.   Last time I came here is got the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter off the tap, and ordered some boneless wings off the appetizer menu. The wings were awesome! Great flavor with a moist textured chicken meat.   The bartender asked if I would like to sample some other beers on tap that I haven't tried. I asked him what is the most common one that other using want to sample.He mentioned that the raspberry framboise was the most common. It's higher then any other beer in alcohol content with a fruiting taste, served in a goblet glass. I did try it and it was very good. I will probably order it next time I stop in!  I have always had great experiences while eating or drinking at the Yard House.   FYI: You cannot get a yard of beer! I tried! HAHA

I like how professional he was throughout the whole process.   Gabe was very knowledgeable in the product and services the AAA car buying has to offer. Absolutely the best car buying experience I've ever had!  Thank you AAA!

GREAT HAPPY HOUR SPOT!!  I really love the atmosphere at this ahso. The layout is nice and open compared to other locations.   The happy hour menu is the main reason I visit this place so often. They have a great selection for both food and drinks.   The staff here is always super friendly and seem like they enjoy being there.   I really wish they didn't close so early during the week, sometimes i have to race here from work to get in before they close.

Man...Talk about great Management! While I sat at bar enjoying a couple beers. I noticed the manager walking around to make sure everyone was having a good time. That type of gesture just doesn't happen anymore with business. It's good to see!!  The atmosphere here is very entertaining. Plenty of LARGE flat screen TVs all around to watch. Music is very hip and up beat! They have a digital juke box, that allows you to select the music you want to play.   The food here is really good considering it's a sports bar. I recommend getting the sampler platter. Plenty of food for 3 or 4 people. You will be glad you tried it!  This location is very convenient right off the Hwy. 101 and Thunderbird Rd.

This staff here are great! You can't go wrong with the Barros lunch specials! I usually get a slice, a fountain drink, along with the salad bar all for under 5 dollars! If that's not a good lunch deal, then I don't know what is.   This place is conveniently located on the south east corner of reems and greenway rd    In the bribing pod Walmart parking lot. Parking is never an issue here. Like it is at most other Barros around lunch time. I really like how big it is inside also.   I finally found the courage to try their buffalo chicken pizza.. And man I need to tell you it was absolutely amazing! I am definitely get it again over my usual pepperoni slice! The salad bar here is also very good. They have a nice selection that is always well maintained and kept fresh. Like I said you get a good meal for under $5 I think that's pretty epic!   Keep up the great work guys and girls of Barros on reems and greenway!

Wow! I was in and out after transferring my title and renewing registration! Total of 13 minutes! Thought for a moment I was getting "Punked" or something. Haha seemed to good to be true.   Well it started off by my letting my work now that I had to run to the DMV and I would be returning in about a hour to a hour and a half. Just thought that was the norm for these types of places.   I pull up to the DMV next to the Sheriffs Office and realize the wait was absolutely re-donkulous! Out the damn door!! Are you serious!! Ugh!!  So I searched title places on yelp and would you know there was one literally right down the dang street from the DMV! I figured with a wait like this I had nothing to lose and everything to gain at this point.   I pull up to west valley motor vehicle and don't notice a line out the door! This is a great sign. I walk in there was one individual a head of me. I kid you not I was in and out of the place in less than 20 mins. Long story long... I return to work way earlier than I or anyone else for that matter expected! Put me in a good mood all day! Thank the heavens for West Valley Motor Vehicle!!

Great Property in the north west valley!  I visited this property last fall for a wedding. Black Stone is very high end and very beautiful! I really love the theme they are going for here.  The wedding event I attended was amazing! Black Stone really knows how to cater a large group. They have a large outdoor courtyard area with a nice bar where the reception took place. The whole set up was awesome! If you're looking to have a wedding event at black stone, you'll love it here.  I have had the opportunity to golf here a couple times. The course is one of the best I have seen in Arizona. Extremely well maintained and the staff are very welcoming and professional. If you have not had a change to golf at this exquisite course, you definitely need to put it on your bucket list!  I cannot wait to visit this place again!

Great Location! This place is very clean, and the staff is always on point! They seem to have it handled especially when they are busy during lunch hours. Lot of places to sit in this location, unlike some other chipotle resturants I have visited.

This place is great! After being out on the lake all day, what a great place to come and relax for some cocktails and appitizers!.   I absolutley love the atmosphere here! You can literally dock your boat right near the resturant eat then be on your marry way. They usually have a live band which seemed to be pretty good!   I ate the hot wings here. They weren't bad at all. Can't wait to come here again!

This place has outstanding hot dogs!   They are very proud to serve Vienna Beef as they have signage though out the place letting you know. The atmosphere is really neat. They have Chicago artifacts all over the place, the smell alone let's you know this place is authentic!   I wasn't feeling to terribly hungry, so I ordered the Jumbo Hot Dog and a medium drink. Very reasonably priced, and they do all the fixings for you, just like they would in Chicago at a hot dog stand. I had mustard, onions, cucumbers, pepper chines, salt, and pepper! Gosh...That was a delicious combination.   The Vienna Beef was amazingly moist with a great flavor! I can see why these guys are so proud to serve the Vienna Beef. Haha  I cannot wait to visit this spot again! I promised I would tell 7 people about how great my experience was here!

Nice apartments! Wish there was an easier way to get to them.  Also you cannot drink alcohol at the pool. That's a big deal for me, cause I enjoy sipping a cock tail by the pool every now and then.

This chipotle know what they're doing. They have a great team of staff here that keep the line flowing during the busy lunch hour rush. Parking is not the best attribute for this location however they compensate pretty well with it comes to communication and team work. I really had a wonderful experience while ordering and eating at this location! Awesome job guys and gals! Keep it up!

BEST SPOT ON THE LAS VEGAS STRIP!  This place is absolutely amazing! This is by far my favorite place on the strip now! There is so much to do and every thing inside is extremely well put together and beautiful!   We came here to celebrate my brothers bachelor party with a small group of us we had a kick ass time. The atmosphere here is very very awesome and up beat. There is so much going on every corner you turn. The right when you walk in had a lot of attention with sexy exotic dancers and flaring bartenders!   We started off getting some drinks at this crazy hyped up bar and we were all very entertained I am not going to lie. The staff really go out of their way to make sure you're not bored. haha  After our drinks we decided to hit the tables and test our luck with black jack. Seem like we all came away with something that night. Money that is. haha   There is so much going on there, We found ourselves wondering the strip and always ending back up at the Cosmopolitan. This place is great! No wonder why everyone likes it. Again... BEST SPOT ON THE STRIP!

I have been to a lot of Barros in the valley.. This location has their stuff together!   They also seem to keep up with the busy lunch rush, I have never had to wait for a pie to come out of the oven. I can usually get in and get a couple slices no hassle! No waiting!  The staff here are very upbeat and friendly. They greet you as a guest as if they were welcoming you into their personal home. It's a great thing to see and experience when it seems as if every staff member appreciates their position here.   PLENTY OF SEATING! Another frustrating down fall of other locations is either small location, and or not enough seating. Here that is not the case! This please is well put together and designed!  I am very happy this location is just Dow. The road from my work, and should like to see someone challenge my Dukedom here!!

I have live here since April 2010. My stay here has been great! I really don't think there are many luxury apartments better this these in the area. The square footage is large and the atmosphere is wonderful. Sitting at the main pool reminds you of a classy resort! Definitely worth your time if you're considering to live here.

Amazing!! Absolutely Amazing!!!  Probably the best Mexican food I have had in a long time! This place is right off Guadalupe and Higley, Which is south of the US 60.   I few colleges and I decided to give this place a try, because one of us found it on Google maps when we were searching for near by places to get lunch.   This building has a really cool theme and design. Right when I walked in a could tell it would be a great experience. The restaurant is pretty large on the inside with vaulted ceiling, and a nice layout.   During Lunch hours they offer a lunch menu, when I ordered from. I ordered a beef burrito with red enchilada sauce. The meal comes with rice and beans. The deal was prepared very well. The beef was very tender and juicy, The  service here was very good, and professional.  I think next time I come here I want to try the chicken burrito instead of the beef.

So I've been passing by this place for sometime now, and finally I've built up the courage to actually stop in and try it. Needless to say, I would like to know where I can sign up to be a regular here! This place, the staff, the food, and experience was absolutely amazing.   I came here for dinner to try the Pho since I've heard a lot of good things. I started by ordering a kilt lifter beer and the infamous spring rolls. These spring rolls were a huge hit for me! Extremely refreshing and the taste was more than imagined. The dipping sauce that come with the rolls had a peculiar taste that seemed to be addicting. I have to give two thumbs up for the spring rolls! I ordered the Surf and Turf pho (which is not on the menu) the waitress Faith told me about the hidden menu item, and it sounded perfect for what I was craving. Once I received the pho I had this sense of excitement and astonishment, by the preparation/ presentation of the whole course. (Laymans term: it looks cool and came with a lot of sides to customize the flavor. VERY FUN!) The broth had a great unique taste, which kept me in wonder how they did it! The Pho here is worthy for anyone to try. I would recommend it for sure!  Once I was finished with my pho. Faith(waitress) asked if I would like some coffee with liquor in it. It's sounded amazing when she described all the stuff they put in it. I told her" YES, I want one of those!!" Once I tasted this cup of coffee, I thought to myself..."does this place have anything that is bad about it? I can't seem to find it!" Long story short.. The coffee was brilliant! It's not on the menu and doesn't have a name yet. I told Faith, they should call it "Kung Pao Coffee" If you should choose to try this coffee. Ask Faith, Dallas recommends the Kung Pao coffee. She will know what your talking about. Haha    So obviously my experience is worth five stars.. Since this is my first visit here, I would like to witness the same kind of experience and customer service on my second visit for the fifth star to evaluate accuracy of it all.   I will be visiting you again Saigon Kitchen! Mark my words. Haha Great job!

Okay... I don't know if they realized that they're starting to lose money with their style of allowing people to select their own selections and portions, but I truly feel as if the bowl are getting smaller and smaller each time I come back to this establishment. What the HELL is going on Genghis??!! I am truly disappointed! :( you can't even pour your own sauces anymore. Now they have a attended grab your sauces for you. How very much frustrating! I have never felt so ripped off after spending $8.99 for a meal.   Let alone our waitress was not doing the place any justice for a decent review out of me.. I felt so rushed! It's the first time I got to experience the check coming out with the food, without asking for it. What kind of operation are they trying to run here now?!?!  Lord please make Genghis Grill go back to the way they used to do thins, so that way there, I can call it one of my favorite places to eat again!!

A friend brought me here for the first time. I was blown away when I took a bite out of my burger. I ordered their signature burger brûlée and wow!!!!! Probably one of the best burgers I've had in the valley.   The place is located in Paradise valley. The staff are great and very friendly.   I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious burger in the paradise valley area.

The check in coupon here is a scam! It's expired! WTF?!  First off I was not happy to see they have a check in coupon still advertised on yelp and not willing to honor it. It's not anyone's fault but the businesses that they are not clearly managing their yelp account properly. The coupon was for some complimentary fries with a purchase of an entree. I could careless about the fries, it's the point that I care about.   The service seem to be pretty good the staff is very up beat and friendly. The atmosphere here was really cool. We came during the football games on a Sunday, and man was there a lot of hype and energy there.   The food was pretty good, I ordered the wings with a kilt lifter beer. All in all I had a good time except for the whole not honoring the yelp check in coupon.

Good BBQ!!  I really like this place a lot! Couple reason why... The food first of all is outstanding!! I little bit on the pricey side, but I am always full when I leave this place! Second of all... They have complimentary pickles and soft service ice cream!!   The atmosphere here is really cool. A lot of the decor is of old vintage western types. The photos on the walls are clearly vintage western.   Right when you walk into this place your sense of smell is going to get the best of you... You will not be able to wait to order your food, with such a delicious sent attacking you!!  They just started doing this points program where you enter your phone number and for every dollar you spend you get a point. When you rack up 80 point you get a free meal. Kind of cool I think!  When I come here I usually get what they call the 2 meat plate... I get it with the spicy cheedar sausage and chopped beef brisket. You also get a choice of two sides. I like the baked-potatoe cassorole and the mac and cheese. The meal comes out to about $10.  I would really recommend the Spicy BBQ sauce they have! Very Good!!  I wish they had more locations throughout the valley :(

Amazing dancers here! Looking to learn salsa, tango, foxtrot, rumba, swing, etc... These folks know their stuff for sure!!  Me and my spouse were invited through a friend to attend one of Dance Doctors monthly dance parties they throw for their students. Talk about a very fun time. They had awesome music, fun, food, drinks, and ofcourse dancing all night long.   The studio set up is genius! Very very well thought out with decor. Everyonw is so friendly and dancing seems to bring them together for a fun and exciting time.   The owners of the studio are very talented and come highly recommened in the dance teaching industry. They've competed in many competitions, and have won several rewards.   If you're looking for a great place to take dance lessons of all kinds of styles this place is where you need to be.

This place used to be called "Bad Ass Coffee" I don't know about you... But it's still pretty bad ass to me! Haha   They even have a drive thru! Freaking Awesomeness!! I think it should be a law for all coffee spot to be required to have drive thru service. Haha (wishful thinking) on e serious note Sensational is one of my top three got to go to coffee spots out there. The service is undeniably excellent! They really do have a way to always make their customers feel good and smile. They have great coffee and food here, no question about it. There are so many options when it comes to making your cup of Joe here. Really makes it kind of cool and fun at the same time. I usually just get the green tea latte with extra espresso shots. Yum! The place in the inside is really comfortable and cozy, with a cool atmosphere.    If you haven't already had the opportunity to experience Sensational Coffee you need to get your butt down there and pay them a visit!

What a great place! Surprise definitely needed a place like this! My five year old daughter and I love to visit this place for some Gelati.   They are located next to Buffalo Wild Wings, and the place is not very big on the inside, but the product is absolutely amazing.  I ordered the Gelati which is custard at the bottom, homemade Italian ice cream, and more custard on top. I got the cookies and cream ice cream. It was very tasty!  I think next time I'll try the mango ice cream with vanilla custard. This place is awesome and I very much so recommend checking it out if you have not already!

I ordered the prime rob sliders and a 24 oz draft beer. The food was very filling and delicious. I would definitely recommend the prime rob sliders here!   The bar area looks really cool too and they have plenty of tv if you are looks for a great place to grab some drink and watch the game.   I will absolutely be a frequent visitor here. Great place. Great prices. Great food.

Pretty neat little country bar/ resurtant...  I stopped in here on a random Friday night. They had quite a few people here. The place smelled delicious like home made BBQ! It has a cool small town country bar feel, that I havn't felt since being back at my small home town.   There was a pretty decent sized dance floor with a live country band. Lots of people having tons of fun and country dancing!   I was also happy to hear that they were have great drink specials. $2 bottled beers. Awesome!   I will definitely be visiting this place again in the future! Lots of fun here!

This place is a joke! I went through Expedia.com to book my room here for the weekend. Everything went well, expect when I got a charge for smoking in a non-smoking room. I don't smoke, and I never have or will. They will not dispute the extra charge, and I still battling with them on this. I will take this up as high as I have to! DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET SCAMMED WITH THE CREDIT CARD YOU PUT ON FILE FOR THE ROOM!!!

I am excited that they finally brought BDubs to Westgate!!  Judging from the size and the placement of this location it will be very entertaining to have it in the westgate plaza! I am especially excited for this place opening up for football season!  They have a outside patio that looks like it would seat close to 100 people, which will be looking out to the courtyard of the kid splash fountain of the westgate plaza.  I am curious to see how parking is going to be with this place opening up, especially during a busy event weekend. Parking is already a major issue here. It's going to be very interesting to see!

This places is great for watching sports. Especially football! They have tons of televisions and several projector screens. I have been up here a few times for football Sunday, and a couple UFC fights. It's absolutely awesome here!  There staff are really friendly, and know their product well. I like how they have their names in the back of their shirts, for the simple fact that I can be horrible sometimes with names.   The menus is very impressive! They have tons of different genre of foods to choose from, most importantly they have a decent drink selection as well. Before we go there let's get back to the food menu... The wings are supposed to be pretty delicious here from what I know. They have about 21 different wing sauces to choose from. I really like the Spicy Garlic!   Tuesday nights they advertise "Wing Tuesday" where all day they have 60 cent wings. That's pretty cool!  If your looking for a cool, entertaining sports enthused atmosphere you need to stop by and check this place out in the West Gate Plaza!

Great new location on the SW corner of Power Road & McDowell Road!  The Owners Mikey and Amanda are very friendly, and are extremely knowledgable with answering any questions you might have regarding nutrition or supplementation.  They have a ton of supplements here.. Anything from multi-vitamins, to creatine, to fish oils, to Pre-workouts, to proteins! So much to choose from, its awesome!!  I was most interested in their shake menu.. I got one of their meal replacement shakes. It's really cool have it works! You select your base.. I chose almond milk.. Then you select your flavor.. I chose strawberry-banana. Then since I chose meal replacement shake to begin with additional ingredients are added, such as 50g of Protein, 49g of Carbs, and multi-vitamins. The shake was very tasty and filled me up!   I think next time I will try the "Stack" Flavor, which is... Base, 60g Protein, 100+ Carbs, 5g Creatine, 5g Glutamine, Peanut Butter, Oatmeal, Carb Powder  Make sure when you checkout, that you ask for a punch rewards card! After your 9th shake the next one is on the house!   This place is definitely going to be my go to spot for supplements and shakes!

Well this is probably the nicest Filibertos I have been to ever! The location is very clean and offers a lot of seating in the dinning area inside and outside. The menu are giant LCD screens, and you have great view of the cooking from the cook window.   I ordered the carne asada burrito meal, which came with rice and beans and a drink. The food was great!  I almost wanted to order another burrito to go for later, it was that good! The meal was very affordable.   I've always been very hesitant with these smaller Mexican food places. Some of them are very dirty and disgusting from what I've seen. This place would be at the opposite end of the spectrum for sure.

This place is perfect for the whole family!   The location used to be called a different name. The new and improved frozen yogurt joint is awesome! Very well organized and clean. There are also plenty of seating inside and outside. I know these yogurt places usually lack on the seating, however this one doesn't As I've notice.   They have many flavor selections of frozen yogurt. I really like the cooked marshmallow and the coffee flavors. Once you've selection your choice of yogurt there are a plethora of toppings to throw on. I mean they must have thought of everything for toppings! I put some white chocolate chips, mini Reese's pieces on mine. My 5 year old daughter went a little over board with the toppings. Haha clearly her eye were bigger than her stomach!   For three cups of frozen yogurt with many topping the tab was under $10 that's impressive in my book!   This place is definitely going to benefit from my repeat, repeat, repeat business. If you haven't had a chance to visit this place I highly recommend it! Bring the little ones too they will have a blast!

You have to take 45 mins out of your life and experience this if you're in Las Vegas!   A small group of us were in town for my brothers bachelor party and came across this awesome land mark on the strip. Are you KIDDING ME??? They actually have a ferris-wheel that has pods that hold 30-40 people with a open bar in each one??!! Wow! Who ever thought of this deserves a damn high fives and the fortune that they are making from it.   We booked our appointment to board our pod and it came to about $40 per person for about 7 of us. You are given tickets like you would if you were seeing a movies in a theater or something. We decided to venture around the strip since we had time before our appointed time to board the pod.   Once we arrived back and boarded the pod you are blown away with the size of it you can fit a lot of people in once of these pods and they have about 25 of them on this wheel. Amazing to see for your own eyes!!  The first thing I noticed was the open bar the was handing out drinks like they were going out of style. It was seriously like a mini club in this thing. It' took about 45 mins for the wheel to go completely around. However I was having so much fun I seemed like 5-10 mins haha.   What a great experience!

Great people here! I love getting my regular dental check ups and my cleanings done here. They really do go above and beyond when it comes to quality work. The hygienist here is awesome! She is extremely diligent and has a plethora of knowledge when it comes to helping keep the plaque and cavities away from your pearly white chompers.   I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great dental office!

This place is absolutely great! The beds are brand new, and it's nicely put together. I was blown away with how awesome the staff are here. Very informative about their beds and product, with top notch customer service! I am happy to say this is my new home when it comes to tanning, or purchasing tanning products.   If you have not already done so, you absolutely need to go in and check this place out! You'll be glad you did.

Great little spot I found in Chandler, that serves very delicious pho of many sorts. This place is located about a mile south of the 202 on Gilbert Rd. I really like the setting and atmosphere they are going for here. Very quiet and peacful place to just get away and relax. I ordered the combination pho without the tendon. It was really good! I loved the textures of the different meats, and the broth was very very good! I was very please with the pho here. I will definietly be back to get it again. I noticed they had a few verieties of vietmenese coffees here. I think I am going to try one next time I visit.

Okay I've probably been to this place three or four times in the last month! I have to say the Green Chili Burrito here is frick'n awesome! It's usually their special for Wednesday's but I usually get it any day. It really filling and has spectacular flavor.   The place is kind of small but in a way makes it seem really cool. I like their Guacamolé and Habanero sauces. Yum!!!  If your in the area and are craving some great Mexican food. You should check this place out! The lady at the register is really nice too! :)

These guys are fantastic! I have never had the experience of going to a barber before I started going to Barber E's Shop.   I visit these guys about every other week now to get my fade and beard trim.   That offer straight edge razor shaving with hot cream, it's a great experience you must try!   Love this place!

The WinCo just opened up in surprise off Bell Rd & Hwy 303. You can see the gigantic store on the west side of the 303 freeway.   This place is beyond awesome!!! Reminds me of a store like Costco or SAMs club only difference is that you do not need a membership at WinCo and they are open 24 hours!   I've never set foot into a WinCo until yesterday and my experience was fantastic! I really enjoyed the self serve for the nuts and other miscellaneous item that you pour into a bag. They have every kind of nut you can imagine!   The meat selection was very stellar and seemed to be very competitive with other places. They have so much to choose from when it comes to the Meat department.   When it comes to dairy or frozen food this place is the flagship for offering the most options available to you. Seriously if it wasn't such a hassle wheeling around two carts we'd probably have two full ones for sure! You can bet your bottom dollar that we did fill our one cart to the top and when it came down to finding out what the damage was... We realized we spent less than $100. Talk about a great feeling!   WinCo, I love you to the moon and back! And yes I'll be back tomorrow!!

Fantastic staff here!! Seems like to me the servers here are always hustling around, providing spectacular service! This location is actually pretty big on the inside. Has large seating sections on both the restaurant side and the bar side. It does have a small patio on the north side the the building also. Parking is never an issue here even when it's slammed. There's a extra huge lot north of the building.   My friends and I usually pick this place when we all meet up for happy hour. They have a great beer and wine selection. Also I've noticed they have a relatively wide variety of hard liquor here too.   I usually order beer from the tab here. My selection normally are with Coors Light or Kilt Lifter. My top favorites for sure! They have a pretty good happy hour menu list of item for either food or alcohol here too.   We had a party of 15 people here and the service did not skip a beat! It was awesome! We ordered the big 36 inch pizza they have here plus a ton of appetizers and drinks for the group. We absolutely destroyed the pizza! There was not a crumb left. The pizza was very awesome. It wasn't too greasy, and it had good flavor. I think it was the biggest pizza I've ever seen in my whole life! Haha I love the wings here too! I usually order the medium spice. You can't really go wrong there.   There are lots of flat screens hung all over the place. Makes it really cool/ convenient when you are here to catch the game or watch the fight. Pretty much any direction you that you are seated here, you have a few tv's in sight.   This place is 5 stars for me! I always have a great time when I am come here and always look forward to coming back.   If you looking for a great HAPPY HOUR spot, you should check it out.

This gym has everything you need! If your looking for a great place for the whole family they have it all here! I was blown away by the selection of machines and free weights they have here!   I was happy to see that that this place wasn't over crowed or had a bunch of sloozies walking around trying to find their Prince Charming. Seems like that is all you find at any other gym in surprise. Haha The atmosphere here is very cool. And it's seems to be a mature family oriented bunch, every time I stop in here.   I was very impressed with the modular pulley system they have here. I've never seen a three tower pulley, that could fit 12 individual people simultaneously. Way cool to see!   The layout of the fitness center is pretty neat too. I like how the cardio machines don't face directly at the free weight area like most gyms do. Keeps the awkward stair eliminated. Haha   The staff here are super friendly and actually seem like they love their jobs! The two owners Mike and Tammy are always there offer exceptional customer service to make sure your fitness experience is top notch! Truly awesome individuals, with hearts of gold!   The childcare is awesome! I take my 8 year old and 7 month old every time I stop in, and they both love it! They also offer kids fitness classes too, which I thought was really cool.   If you're looking for a great fitness center in the west valley, you definitely owe it to yourself to check this gym out!

The atmosphere here is absolutely awesome! You're always greeted by friendly energetic staff right when you walk in! The concept here is really fun. You walk in, order the artillery you'd like to use and the. You are seated in your section.   The booths/ bays here are a decent size that can fit a medium sized groups. If you come here as a couple or with an entire group, it's super fun either way. If you like arcade shooting virtual reality games like Area 51 or games like call of duty, you are going to love it here!   The weapons are loaded with CO2 cartridges that simulate a realistic recoil for the weapon. The servers will bring you more ammo as you run out to reload your weapons.   The food here is really really good! Just glancing at the menu, I wanted to try everything! We ordered the cheese and meat board and it was delicious. I would recommend it to anyone.   We really had a fantastic time here. It's just a great way to have some cocktails and fun with family/ and or friends. Like I said this place is great for groups.   What a great idea! I am so stoked that they put it in the Peoria area! P83 baby!!! Haha
