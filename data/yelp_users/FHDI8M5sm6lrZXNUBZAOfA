After 5 years in Phoenix and so much anticipation of trying Coronado Cafe, I was extremely underwhelmed. Nothing was bad. Nothing was stellar. I didn't hate my meal, but was more perplexed by raving reviews after such a mediocre experience.  We kicked off our dinner with the infamous crab cakes which were delicious no doubt. That's where the enthusiasm ended. Having enjoyed them so much I decided to order the crab soup of the day which had a tomato and vegetable base and threw in a half Greek salad for good measure. My other half got the cheese burger. The soup tasted old and had no special quality to it with mushy veggies and completely pulled apart crab strings that made this like a tortilla soup without the spice. The salad was served on basic yellow romaine with no distinguishing qualities that set it apart from Souper Salad or Olive Garden.  For $11, I can't say I was thrilled. My beau's burger charted the same on his satisfaction scale - nothing to write home about.  The people were very sweet and the ambiance was cozy, but the ambiance was also...quiet. Very quiet, like empty quiet.  Perhaps brunch is bustling on weekends and the different menu poses more potential. But we won't be back for dinner.

This place makes me want to wear a sunhat and walk around in khakis explaining the life cycle of a cactus (ok nothing makes me want to walk around in khakis, but it helps with emphasis). The layout is beautiful, the volunteers are friendly, and the setting is perfect to showcase desert beauty. Coming from the Midwest 2 years ago, I didn't realize how lovely succulents are.  Kermit wasn't lying, it ain't easy being green - especially in this hot box, we're more browns and grays. Yet the garden sets it up very well and makes the desert interesting with programs, events and ongoing education. I love how this place mixes nature and social life by hosting all types of events: music, Yelp parties, luminaries, etc.   This is a great place to go when you have visitors or when you don't have much on your agenda and want to avoid going stir-crazy. I'll admit I may have impulsively bought a discounted DBG membership on Groupon more for the IDEA of going here often, but it's worth it even for the few times you make it out in a year.

I dragged my newly motivated butt into a real running store for the first time now that I've admitted to being a committed runner. After having bought several pairs of "running" shoes solely because they were on clearance at the Nike outlet, I heard lovely and fantastical rumors about non-agressive running angels that would actually talk to me, watch me walk/run and recommend the perfect shoe.  The rumors are true. The people here are so incredibly nice. Not only did the salesperson patiently let me test out multiple pairs multiple times, but now I also know all about his personal running feats, his family, and got an invite to drop in on a running group (although they weren't trying to sell me a bunch of excess gear, they were trying to talk me into training for a 1/2 marathon). I ended up with a great pair of shoes (and thus much happier joints now that I have real shoes) and somehow a mini support network. Great, great place.

Sorry but no. I really wanted to like this place from the good reviews and because it's a stone's throw from my place. But I won't be returning.  Not sure if my experience was due to having the only male employee who rushed through my mani/pedi or if it's consistently like this. It was so busy on a Friday afternoon, I was sure people must be there for a reason. But my nails looked like absolute crap. The dude was very nice, but he painted all over my cuticles and the nail polish was probably 6 years old and chunky. That didn't seem to stop him as he globbered it all over my fingers.  I literally went home, took all the polish off and repainted it myself. Thanks for the trim and the footsoak, but I'll take my business elsewhere.

How have I not reiviewed LGO yet? How? I'm flabbergasted at the fact that I have not publicly declared my love for this gem of a neighborhood hangout. Here it is - my heart on my sleeve. Or my drool on my shirt  The atmosphere here is the closest vibe I've found to my Minneapolis roots. All kinds of strokes, all kinds of folks, and the underlying assumption that you already "know" everyone, including the people you haven't met. Every time I go, which is every other day, I sit next to some perfect stranger and feel like they're my next door neighbor. Funny cuz I actually did meet my next door neighbor at LGO the day after moving in across the street.  Fabulous vegan and veggie fare, enough on the menu to keep me interested for as regularly as I go. And the English Muffins. Oh the English Muffins. They are as big as my face and delicious enough to have their own Facebook page (Hello if the Cowboy Ciao Original Chopped Salad can have it's own FB page, so can these muffins!). Wine shop, colassal cookies, dog friendly and the best source for last-minute random gifts. That is one big ass orange.

Everything I want in a neighborhood joint to make me jealous of not actually living in the neighborhood. Lovely setting and layout, good mix of conventional dining getup with sofa/chair/couch/table combos interspersed, waiters with cool hats, and finger-lickin fancy fare. Not too fancy for these jeans, but fancy enough for my heels.   It takes a damn good Bruschetta to make me crack my vegan ways, but I confess my cheese-avoidance got lost between the brie and the apples and smothered with fig. For me the bread was just a tad too soft, but the wine was just right. Fantastic for a romantic date or group gathering - will be back soon!

Now that I actually do live in the hood, it's time to revise. What's up neighbor?! That's how I feel now when I stop by for a glass of vino. Maybe they don't know me that well, but they do seem to recognize my dog. She's actually why this place gets an extra star - super dog friendly patio. Bowl of water and constant affection from the staff every time my hound comes along. She's spoiled here and it make me happy.  Food is still fabulous and the wine...Oh the wine. How I crave that Garnacha when I'm anywhere else. There really is no time that's not good to be here, but I love lounging outside on week nights when it's not quite as busy. I always meet fun people here that are also soaking up the good vibes. I officially can never move away from Arcadia.

This has been on my "to try" list for ages. We live down the street, we need a watering hole, and most importantly one that allows dogs. We found it. I almost don't want to shout out the rave reviews too loudly because it's so cool and I don't want to attract any uncool-ness with rave reviews. But I do want to give props to a terrific establishment.  The interior is beautiful, I love the lofty feel over the bar. The crowd was a nice mix and good representation of our Arcadia hood. Not too rowdy, not too stiff. The ambiance was set up very well, with a little sports flair but casual dining as well away from TVs.  The waitstaff is attentive and genuine. The food was above-average pub fare with plenty of veg options for us meatless mongers. The only minus was that while the patio allows dogs, not ALL areas of the patio are dog friendly according to our host. So we had to sit away from the bulk of table and couldn't sit under the heaters (which also apparently couldn't be moved). It was 50* out and pretty chilly, so I'll plan for that next time.

What a relief. You know that feeling when you finally need a really important but common service, you don't have even a slight clue as to where to go, the options are overwhelming, and you really can't afford a "trial and error" that results in error? Tailors and dentists come to mind. Veterinarians also fall into this category for me.  My hound developed a large mass on her hind leg and from the first phone call to Blue Cross, I had a very reassuring feeling that she'd be in the right hands. Our first visit was a slam dunk - my hound warmed right up to Dr. Ryan who walked us thru our options in a very knowledgeable and comforting way. Three days later, we dropped her off, had it removed, and we are on our way to recovery.   Though the lump saga is far from over, I'm confident this is the best place to be dealing with it. The staff is friendly to both of us (owners need just as much TLC as pets in these situations), and the location is convenient. We'll be patrons/patients for a long time.

After living in Tempe for 2 years, I'm very grateful to be now living within 10 minutes of this Whole Foods. If I had to rank all WF in the valley, this wouldn't be at the tippy top, but it's a huge improvement from the Tempe store which would certainly be at the bottom. Way more local produce, much larger salad bar and prepared foods section, and more events.  People don't call it Whole Paycheck for nothing, but it's worth it to come mid-week when I couldn't make it to the farmers market and see some solid local options. I'm giddy when they have a huge selection from Sunizona Farms. Since it's also 10 minutes from Arcadia, I am one happy local girl.

Be sure to allow an absolute minimum of one hour for this store. Its treasures are sunken deep within the piles and piles of literature, media, and miscellaneous items that you may not need but will purchase because they are so freaking cheap. You may at some point end up on a stool somewhere with your morning coffee paging through a Swedish phrase book and finally look up to see the sun setting.   You can plop down in any corner of the store and page through an unlimited number of random books you'd never think you'd find interesting or that you maybe thought would be a lot cooler than they turn out to be and so will luckily never buy.  In many cases I find things that I may not read, but damn $2 sounded like a good idea when I was in the Half Price time-warp-induced stupor. Did I really think I'd read 100 Questions You Should Be Asking About Your Personal Finances? Well, another man's garbage is...another woman's coaster. Still a good deal!  The DVD collection is awesome as well and usually worth the patience of scanning through each shelf. $3 copy of Big Trouble in Little China. Enough said.  You probably won't get much compensation when you try to sell books back here, but you'd be getting rid of them anyway so you might as well reap the 50 cents and put it toward your next purchase. Wonderful place to kill an entire afternoon.

I'll admit I'm a little sad I don't get the "First to Review" badge and that last reviewer prompted or rather reminded me that I must give this place a stellar rating.  My fried got married here in November and the setting was absolutely gorgeous. Because the wedding was smaller in size, it took place in the courtyard by the fountain. We were surrounded by greenery, wood carvings and stone statues. It was very comfortable and felt completely secluded from the rest of Arizona. Who could tell that we were in the middle of a flat residential area? No one.  The bridesmaid room was adorable, and now I know how I want to style my house if I ever have one. The staff was very friendly and laid back. Though I haven't been to many weddings in the Valley, this is the best venue I could possibly recommend. It isn't cheap, but they do have several pricing options - this reception was at a differnt venue to avoid the setup/breakdown and table/linens rental costs.   All in all it was beautiful and perfect.

Eesh. I'm going to try to avoid this place. I'll admit it's not my style at all though it suits others just fine: not veg friendly, not energetic, not worth the money. I don't have to eat like a health nut to enjoy my food, but even their french fries suck. And that's my main criteria for judging mediocre venues with limited meatless fare. You could earn an entire star with good french fries despite a crappy atmostphere. Native New Yorker? Fail.  The other food I saw wandering around looked pretty, um, bad...from what I hear the pizza is especially unappetizing. The waitstaff was average and on the slow side. The beer selection is ok and I sat contently with my Stella. But overall this is not my scene.

I'm really glad North Scottsdale has a 4 Peaks location to keep it real. I tend to feel less and less compelled toward that area as it pops up with more commercial, crappy, generic restaurants, shopping centers and social hot (not) spots. I'm not big on the overall vibe up there for the most part, but I'm a softie for 4 Peaks. This location was equally as tasty and fun lovin as the Tempe joint but not as crowded. The food, the beer, the staff - all consistent with the original. I was really happy we found a spot to actually sit during a playoff game!  I'll be sure to ALWAYS suggest going here anytime I venture that-a-way. I'd take a microbrew and Thai Hummus over a Coors and nasty nachos anyday.

My Saturday morning almost always revolves around walking my pup over to Xtreme Bean for some hot tea and a brief chance to catch up on the news or page through some free AZ periodicals. The experience IS my "morning coffee" and I feel cranky without it.  The staff is hipster (whatever you take that to mean), the tea selection rocks, the food is tempting (meaning I don't usually go there hungry but I end up wanting a sandwich anyway), and they keep dog biscuits behind the counter. 1-2-3-4 stars. And though I am typically skeptical of all places with a drive thru, it is incredibly fast and convenient when you need a quick Xtreme fix. Kelly and Kona (the dog) approved.

I live here. Like I actually found an apartment in this neighborhood because I'm here so much. Between the selection, quality of food, and prices, this store is ideal for a health conscious individual who doesn't want to be economically punished for their decision to eat real food instead of crap.  The produce selection does not vary as much as you might expect seasonally, but the prices are always low and they always have great deals. They have a good organic section, but the non-organic produce isn't lacking in quality.  Their pantry/dry food items are a little pricier than a store like Frye's, but I trust their Sunflower brand - you can pronounce all of the ingredients. Their frozen section is also great with a lot of good organic picks. I probably shouldn't even start about the bulk section - because it's awesome and I could go on forever just about the nuts, munchies, and grains here. Their beer selection is one of the best as well with lots of small and funky breweries on the shelf.  Overall, if you need produce, this is the place without question. For other items, you could maybe find cheaper versions at other quality stores (aka Trader Joe's) if you're willing to make a few additional stops. But you'll generally find quality versions of everything you need here without grocery bill anxiety.

I may not have high standards, I may not frequent anything that resembles a SPA, but I have experienced the feeling that my cuticles are so outrageous that I don't even want to walk around barefoot in the privacy of my own home. With that said, I don't want or need to spend half my paycheck on nitty gritty footwork I'm not willing to tackle myself. For the price, this place was awesome.  For $20, I got a pedicure that blew my feet away. The ladies up to the task were wonderful and very friendly. They made great chit chat and exuded pure toenail talent at the same time. When they told me the price, I felt like I had to compensate with tip because the pedicure was so professional and satisfying. This would definitely be my "regular" pedi joint if I could ever sustainably afford the indulgence. I will absolutely come here again.

Eesh - I normally go to the gym in Tempe, so maybe that has spoiled me since it's brand new. This location looked big and drafty on the outside, and a little bit dumpy on the inside. I didn't really like how the cardio and weights were smushed together (I was staring at burly dudes pumping iron while doing an interval workout on the treadmill - not ideal) and the equipment was a old.  I went there to attend the Body Plus class and I really enjoyed the instructor. She a a great routine and was super buff which is good for inspiration. But the sound equipment was broken and the poor thing couldn't even play music during a fast pace weights class that relies on counting. According to another gym member, it had been broken for a few days. I'm no AV expert, but you've gotta have someone to fix or replace fuzzy speakers in less than 72 hours, no?   I'm glad I went to the class, but I'll just wait until 4:30 rolls around next time for the same class at my own gym.

Live music, laid back and - if you're lucky-  room to dance a bit by the band. Some nights it's jam packed and you can hardly get through the door, other nights it's nice to just sit and enjoy your beer. Sometimes it's a very entertaining show with bartender participation, other times is more mediocre. No matter how the place swings - on the busy side or more mellow - it's a fun time. I've only had basic beer and some well drinks here, but I like the beer selection. I was a little put off walking in there for a bachelorette party when we got dirty looks for being dressed up, but the staff was still nice to us (the patrons gave us the stink eye).  Love the bar stools with the big bums - they make for some good photo ops!

I have given this location it's fair share of chances. I have tried sticking up for it's many short comings in response to my husband's chagrin every time I suggest we stop by over the weekend. It is, after all, the closest Starbucks to our house and it seems silly to go out of our way for something so simple as coffee and a muffin. But I am done. I have a higher tolerance and greater patience threshold than your average customer, and it's been an entire year of coming here for my to issue a final evaluation. My thorough and articulate assessment in the end is...this place blows.  Amidst the many grievances I could cite, the one that bothers me most is that they seem to prioritize the drive-thru line over the in-store patrons with 3-4 people bumping into each other scrambling to fulfill orders. Meanwhile, there is one person at the register inside and one person at the espresso machine - regardless of the length of the line at the counter. While other locations seem to mirror this staffing allocation, this place for some reason cannot figure it out. This weekend, we placed our drink order, got our food (from the whole 3 breakfast options left) and waited another 10 minutes before asking whether our coffee was coming. The associate at the register then eloquently yelled to the drive-thru folks "Guys! I have drinks waiting here!" Oh good - so no one noticed the line of cups accumulating. That about captures this store in a nutshell.  While I despise reviews that account for one bad experience, this one was just the straw the broke the camel's back. That poor, un-caffeinated, drowsy camel who was just waiting for a cup of joe.

When people say there is nothing to do in Phoenix or that Scottsdale is comprised only of club-thumping Barbie's and Ken's, I like to take them here. See? This is where the "rest of us" go. You have to know where to go to even find the door, and once you're inside the dimly lit speakeasy, you've found the perfect escape from mainstream nightlife. Lovely for a date with your honey or with your BFF to catch up. Gazillions of choices for wine from places you've likely never heard of and some nosh to tide you over. Perfection!  Wines are obviously the show case here and are pretty well priced even by the glass.  I've had many hits and some misses, but that is to be expected when the wine list is the size of a bible (I actually trust the wine bible more for spiritual guidance). I love the inclusion of varietals outside your typical european/american selection, and they really have something for everyone. Even non-wine fans - although I trust them - can find a good cocktail from one of the talented bartenders. The food isn't really the main attraction, though we typically end up with a nosh. The hummus is quite bland, and the flatbreads are alright. But you CAN order a very special salad from Cowboy Ciao that I happened to be obsessed with, so I'm good!  I dig the live music most of the time, but be ready to pay a cover even if you're not there for the music. The venue is small, so the acoustics make for impossible conversation while the band is playing. There are some tables slightly further away where conversation is still plausible, though they are often reserved by larger parties. As such, seating can be really tight especially on weekend evenings, so drop in early if you want to sit in a chair! Weekdays are fun with a more intimate crowd. And let's face it, when it comes to drinking wine - I hardly discriminate between Tuesday and Friday.

The scene was absolutely lovely. Tall floor-to-ceiling windows, low lighting, a waiter willing to change up our shaky table, live jazz....I need not go on about the ambiance as it was wonderful. It was a little chilly in the restaurant, but a gentleman's jacket always does the trick.  On to the edibles: the wine selection is terrific and we both ended up with extremely fragrant reds that fit the mood perfectly. We started with the firecracker calamari - I don't care if you don't like seafood, order it. The sauce was unlike any sauce I've had with calamari and I would have eaten it by the spoonful if my lady-like conscience hadn't kicked in. I was so torn with the meatless fare because the options were so nice, but finally decided on the eggplant rolls. They however were extremely disappointing. For a place this pricey and exquisite on all levels, I would have expected perfectly cooked eggplant. But the under cooked aubergine was way too chewy and the sweet and sour sauce underwhelming. I anticipated a sauce as delicious as the appetizer, but instead got something that looked like it could easily have come from a bottle. Not impressed, but my significant other loved the short ribs.  Overall, the service, wine and setting were beautiful and I would return to try other vegetarian options, but that eggplant needs some work. Or it needs to come off the menu. Or I need to have a few more glasses of wine to care less.

Having only lived here since August '08, I wasn't one to go out and furnish my apartment in one day or even one weekend cuz it's not my style to come home to a completely ikea'd house - which is why I come here every couple of weeks.   I really like all the funky furniature and I have found lots of classic pieces for really decent prices. If you can go there semi-regularly you could score some major furniture finds (still regretting that I didn't buy this pair of red chairs cuz I'll never find those again!). There is course some junk thrown in the mix, but that is the appeal of consignment shopping. I really dig their decorative collection as well  - place settings, vases, platters, lamps, etc...  The staff has always been friendly and helpful versus the Scottsdale location in which I've never been greeted or spoken to, not that I expect a best friend out my shopping experience. Definitely worth a quick peruse if you're in the neighborhood, you never know what you'll find!

We have done a lot of staycations in Phoenix and Scottsdale, but Sanctuary by far exceeded any experiences we've had elsewhere. Granted it was for a 3 year anniversary and the vibes we had set a good platform for an awesome weekend, but the resort itself was perfect in so many ways. We were able to snag a room with a balcony and were welcomed with chocolate covered strawberries in celebration of the anniversary.   The rooms are so beautiful - I just wanted to jump on the bed, open and close all the doors and drawers and fill the bath tub up with hot water and fancy salts. How cool is that window between the bathroom and bedroom? Super cool. It's the small things. The staff was incredibly friendly, gracious and helpful at every turn which made our stay even more relaxing.  The pool was pretty stellar. Very fun chill on the patio outside Elements and enjoy a drink overlooking the pool, but it was even better to lounge in the sun during the day with a blood mary or strawberry basil lemonade. It wasn't too crowded which was nice and the service was prompt. The Sanctuary flip flops were pretty fun too. I feel like I'm still basking in Sanctuary glory even though it's been a week already since our stay. I will definitely recommend this to out of town guests looking for an indulgent splurge. Anniversary perfection.

I love when I'm so impressed by a non-food related business that I actually remember to write about it! The people that work here are 100% wonderful. Honest, straight forward and fast.  After my tune up at the Toyota dealership in Tempe resulting in a recommendation to get 2 tires replaced plus a dented wheel fixed, I said, "Thanks, I'll have it done somewhere else." Took it to Discount Tires who took one look and said, "You're wheel isn't damaged, we'll just do a balance adjustment." 35 minutes later I was on my way with two new tires and a much needed adjustment. Shakey steering wheel fixed and feelin good!  All I wanted was to leave feeling like I didn't get ripped off. Success.

This place was a shocker. I suppose by now I have a certain level of expectation from mid-continental sushi and I'm ok with the quality in AZ despite the distance from aquatic life (Tempe Town Lake doesn't count). While my bar here isn't high, this place wasn't on my list of places to check out. Sushi 101 was a very pleasant surprise. Their menu is diverse enough to appeal to those that like crap in their rolls i.e. cream cheese, those that like the classics, and those that are willing to explore some kind of happiness in between - me.  First of all, I was so impressed that they have more than 1 boring veggie roll. Who on earth offers 4 veggie rolls? This pleases me so. I was even more excited that one of them comes with jalapenos on top - yum! Secondly, the Sun Devil Roll is edible bliss and makes me wish I could carry around that spicy taste in my mouth for days.  I've only ordered take-out so I can't really speak to the atmosphere, but I love sushi so much that the environment I eat it in doesn't matter compared to the taste. The people that work there are pretty cool and it's about 2 miles away from home. Is this the BEST sushi in AZ? Is it the cheapest? No and no. But tasty and convenient enough to make the speed dial.

I am beginning to think that run-down strip malls equipped with weird comic stores and nail salons point to good food nearby. Blue Nile is tucked back in the corner of an old strip mall, but you can smell the spices a-stewing from a block away almost. The smell is very indicative of the food - standard, inexpensive, delicious Ethiopian cuisine, complex flavors, huge variety, vegan friendly (if not encouraging) and utensil-less.  The service was great and helpful, as I am usually indecisive when presented with so many tantalizing options. I highly recommend (as do employees) the vegan combo - you can try 5 dishes with all the bread you want! Yes please. If you're super hungry you may just need all that injera and more, because the portions of each dish are just a little small for a very hungry Joe. For me though, they were perfect.   I will admit, the temperature of my food was a little colder than I prefer, but I got over it. The price is nice and the food finger-lickin' good....really, don't use a fork. The experience is so much more without it.

I've been attending yoga classes here for a couple of months and have enjoyed it so much that I'm signing up for their yoga instructor certification program. SWIHA is both tranquil and positively energizing, warm and familial yet open to strangers. I had only really experienced yoga studios where fitness was the primary concern, but the feel here is more spiritual and health-oriented rather than just fitness. AND the price is right - some of the cheapest yoga and massage prices in the valley.  Coming here makes me want to quit my day job and be someone's life coach and make sacred music mixes.... not really, but it's definitely cool being in an education scene where people are learning about herbology and holistic healing. Hippie-esque? Defintely, but in a way that provides a good oasis from the bronzy, plastic kind seen elsewhere in surrounding areas. Lovely, lovely place.

Ode to my little vegan haven...you are the sweet escape from the strife and angst of eating out almost everywhere else other than my kitchen, a delicious relief from the menus that more resemble checklists of things I cannot/choose not to eat. I can at last read "chicken wings" and actually order them, extra sauce. I can drool at the thought of a po' boy sandwhich, spinach and artichoke dip, or spicy singapore noodles. I can wear a baseball cap, order chili fries and kick it with the home team. I can introduce you to all my beloved carnivores and listen to the "mmmmm"s without any questions as to why I choose to eat the way I do. ** Sigh **

I am finally compelled to write a review because I have frequented this establishment on more than a few occasions and for multiple purposes - hunger, thirst, and the need for a busy scene with a good dose of hipsters.   To eat: The food is ok, but I would never bring out-of-town guests here for dinner to impress. Would definitely recommend coming here after dinner or for a nice, fried drunken snack. To drink: The beer selection is decent, the wine isn't awesome but cheap, and the rest will get the job done if you are willing to wait at the bar.  Really, I come here for the scene. It's busy - lots of different people walking around. You can mingle with strangers or have a private conversation amidst the busy, drunken, smoky scene. Sitting outside makes it the great bar that it is, especially with the heaters on during the colder months. The waitstaff is super chill, considering the kind of banter and shenanigans they have to deal with. Overall, this is one of the cooler bars in Tempe and I'd go here over any Mill bar any day.

I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.  I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, "well we don't have anymore of that one."  Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back, but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. I'm over you being cooler than me, but I'm not over you having no soul.

There are way too many good places in the area to squander time and money at Bungalow and suffer crappy service to boot. I rarely doc a place for service, because I don't need to be swaddled in fine linen and cooed when I dine. However, there is a line. And when the food and drinks are sub-par, aloof personnel just doesn't cut it. Not my first visit, but this was likely the last.  My hubby and I prefer chilling at the bar rather than table service, so we grabbed a couple of stools and settled in on a slow Thursday night for a bite and a beer. The place - bar and table area - was pretty dead, yet it still took at least 5 minutes to grab the bartender. Ok fine, maybe they just wrapped up the dinner rush or something. We order beers and ask for a food menu, taking note of a particularly icy demeanor slapping menus in front of us. But again, not here to make a new friend, so it's cool. Then as we try to get her attention to order, she seems to be avoiding our area. As she makes her way around the bar, grabbing empty glasses and cleaning the counter tops, she is finally within earshot. So I meekly ask "could we order an entree as well?" to which she replies, "I'll be with you in just a minute" and proceeds to wipe down the counter and bus dishes. Is it just me or is there some kind of invisible line that invisible people are waiting it to grab a seat at the bar? I could understand clearing up as a priority when there are patrons waiting to sit and I'd happily exercise patience to allow other people an ejoyable sit, but by now it's 9pm....and it's really dead inside. So....ok we waited for her to finish cleaning. And then ordered.  According to my other half, the rubber chicken sandwich was passable only as a means to slicene hunger pangs. It left his tastbuds rather underwhelmed and waistline rather remorseful with an excess of bread. Has anyone noticed how strange it is for a bar of this size not to have any beer on tap? I've had a few other appetizers on previous visits, but nothing memorable. Again, I don't need a butler for a waiter or souffle as a starter, but I can get a beer and some fries at a whole lot of other places in Old Town from someone who is a little more welcoming of my patronage and cash.

I remember my very first hike up Camelback..."Um ok, how much farther?...Oh shit, THAT's the top?" How I have grown to love this mountain over the past 2 years. It is still challenging for me, but each hike gets easier and you can make it and down in about an hour or so if you're semi-athletic. While I am partial to Cholla Trail, my crazy boyfriend prefers Echo Canyon - he also runs to the top in about 20 minutes at 5pm in July, so I don't give his opinion much credit since it's based on fictitious super-human abilities.  It does get a little crowded in the morning on weekends and parking isn't stellar - in fact I usually get my first taste of being winded on the walk between the car and the start of the trail. If you don't want a fast hike, you won't mind all the people. Some don't have good hiker etiquette and you might find yourself face to boob with a silicone implant somewhere along the way. But it's just a hike and it is what you make it to be. Put your headphones on and enjoy the view. The breeze at the top is worth the energy and sweat to get there.

Fez is swell, juuuuust swell. I love taking out-of-towners here or chilling with my local peeps on a Friday night. It's an attractive space filled with all kinds of people. Very welcoming and posh without feeling uninviting. The kind of place you could wear that hat in the back of your closet that looked like a good idea in the store. Why not? Sure you can pull off a fedora here.  The veggie options are spectacular - though my one caveat is that you'll taste garlic in your mouth for DAYS after eating the hummus plate. Worth it. Wash it down with a damn good margarita and you'll be fine. Seriously, the margaritas are fabulosos. Happy hour and weekend specials are super cheap, and the service is incredibly friendly to boot. Alotta good goin on up in here.

I am a big fan of Carly's all around. I don't usually come here for the food, although I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. The vegan wrap was excellent as was the grilled cheese and the prices were fair. I'm confident that if I end up  here with the drunken munchies, I can at least score some damn good hummus.  The beer selection is wonderful (and fitting for the Roosevelt Hood)compared to many other places in Phoenix. Happy hour is a really great deal and I'm always pleased with the $4 house wine. Sometimes a little too pleased with it as one glass turns into 3 and somehow is capped off with a shot of Jameson. Oops, done that more than once.  I've done the dining side and the bar side, and I very much prefer the bar not because sitting at a table sucks (service is a touch slow), but because I really like planting myself on a stool and chatting with the staff  on slower nights- I think they're pretty cool.  If this place is cool enough for Annie of St. Vincent to chill before she goes on stage at Modified (I wasn't really stalking, just gawking at her coolness), it's ok in my book. Really, this is one of my favorite places here.

I have to say thar for someone who considers herself a foodie - I'm almost surprised by how high I'm rating a chain like this. Yet there is no denying that my experience has been nothing but positive here. Food, beer and staff have been terrific and consistent. Because we are football fan wannabe's without actually possessing the ability to watch a game at home, we like to roll over here for our sports fix. And there truly isn't a bad view in the house, though I've never strayed from the bar.  The beer selection is of course...impressive. I love trying new ones and the bartenders are very patient with doling out samples for an indecisive patron such as myself. On that thought - the bartenders are pretty awesome. Always friendly, always attentive and insightful on both beer and food. While we pretty much always order the same thing (deviled eggs and truffle fries anyone?), I've like most things I've tried on the menu. This is a great place to accommodate the meatless crowd (self included) and even those that live sans carne get cravings for buffalo wings - mission accomplished here! Thank goodness for Gardein.

Sometimes when I'm bored on a Saturday without much on the agenda, I'll head here just to browse. Sometimes when I can't think of what to get someone for Christmas, a birthday or a baby shower, I'll head here to get an idea for a creative gift. Sometimes when I'm at Trader Joe's or Wildflower for a snack and I've got a few extra minutes, I'll head here to walk it off while I digest.  There is something so cozy and familial about this store, it is truly a friendly neighborhood bookstore. They host so many authors, speakers, workshops and classes to get people involved in interesting subjects and social activities. They have a great collection of main stream and indie books mixed in with used books here and there. The employees are helpful and sweet.  What makes it great is that it's perfect for a special stop on your list of errands or just a browsing session if you're waiting for someone to meet you for lunch at Wildflower. It's a fun little corner on McClintock and Guadaloupe and one that I come back to almost every week!

I like. Atmosphere, food, employees, peeps, drinks, bathrooms I like. Parking, maybe not so much, but I'm over it. The sheer number of solid veggie options on the menu is enough for my vote of confidence. To also draft up a specialty cocktail menu that actually looks and tastes appealing to me is a rare and beautiful thing. Mmmm basil strawberry lemonade.  Fries, portobello sandwich, korma, hummus platter - all of them hit the spot for a Friday night sampling. Though it was a bit busy (which was to be expected on a Friday night) and the waitstaff was a little stretched, the experience was fabulous. Good vibes over in the bocce court and great vibes from the people. The kitty was quite the chair hog for such a small furball, but that cat owns the place and is damn cute. I wish I lived closer so I could make this my neighborhood joint.

Love at first sight. Lust at first bite. And now I'm drunk with a red curry pasty infatuation. I don't know how it could have taken me so long to eat here, I've been eyeing this place since I moved here 3 years ago. This is my jam. This is what I look for in an eatery. This is where I want to hide out, drink beers and chat with my tatoo artist about the next ink-scursion.  Small, narrow, dark, perfect level of noise, good music, cool waitstaff, fun kitchen peeps, inexpensive, and friggin delicious. At 9:30 pm there was a line of about 10 people waiting for tables. Yep the food is that good and the joint is that cool.  New mission: try every veggie pasty on the menu and all sweet pasties.

An evening out in Old Town is rarely complete without a post-dinner stroll to The Gelato Spot, and I can find absolutely no reason to subtract stars. The location is perfectly central, so it doesn't matter where you had dinner - this is always "on the way" home and always worth every bite.   Their gelato flavors are mostly standard, although the seasonal flavors and chef-inspired creations have been really impressive. Of course you'd expect a pumpkin gelato around the holidays, but it was so delicious I had a hard time keeping it to one scoop! I have yet to meet a flavor I dislike, but I don't anticipate that happening.  After all, you can sample as many choices as your sweeth tooth desires before committing to just one delicious flavor or combine for the perfect heavanly dessert (if you have room, which I never do). Even their coffee is exceptional and totally hits the spot on cooler winter nights.  The vibe is energetic and laid back at the same time: everyone is just coming here for that near coma-inducing sugary, creamy indulgence and in no rush to end a perfectly enjoyable night. It's incredible that as busy as it gets the staff can maintain so much patience and be so friendly while doling out countless samples. While I haven't tried anything from their lunch/dinner menu, their dessert/coffee/wine are plenty to keep this girl as a regular.

Four years ago, this review probably would have reiceved 4 fewer stars. To be fair, the actual indoor market didn't exist back then, but the "farmers market" was slim pickin's. My oh my how this gem has grown and matured into a downtown, local hotspot that I am happy to frequent twice a week!  The outdoor market on Wednesdays is small, although Food Truck Mania is pretty stellar with TONS of inexpensive meatless options. It's actually kind of nice when it's less crowded, but the produce choices are limited. On Saturdays, the produce is piled high for the most part (summer is ... well... summer) and the vendors are friendly and chatty. The number and variety of small businesses that have started to set up stands here are wonderful. Chocolate? Soap? Veggies? Check. Check. Check.  The indoor market is super cute and hip. Grocery options are limited and expensive, but they carry many of the products or food items you see at the outdoor market. The prepared food as far as breakfast/lunch/dinner goes is ok. I haven't been wowed by any sandwich or salad there yet, but I love the selection of local beer and wine. Hooray for such a hit downtown!

This place jets out some great vibes with its own semi-dive, pseudo punk hipster, quasi sports bar gig goin on. Anyone could fit in here and feel like the scene is just right for what you want. I was initially misled by their funky daily specials, thinking this place was more a fleshy, drunken, routy, sloppy cheap beer joint. Alas, the clouds have parted. I love the board games and have recently fallen in love with the shuffle board. Though the space between the pool tables and shuffle board is quite narrow, this makes for the creation of new friendships (or drunken aquaintences anyway).  The food is fine - I've only ordered food here once, but it was pretty good. My will power however is often stretched to the max around the popcorn after a few shots on Whiskey Makes you Frisky Fridays. This can be both good and bad depending on how much popcorn or maybe how much whiskey is involved...Either way, I will make a conscious effor to be regular here now.

There is nothing I don't like about St. Francis. It makes me feel good all over and is one of the only restaurants I'd actually refer to as sexy. A chic and cozy interior, fantastic music rotation and lovely beverage choices all of which provide for a dark and steamy evening out whether it's with the girls or on a date.  The food is quite something. As much as I restrain myself at the average eating establishment when it comes to bread, St. Francis is different. To not eat the bread and olive oil is to deny yourself a mouthful of fluffy pleasure only found on the other side of the Atlantic. The flatbreads are scrumptious and don't even get me started on those fingerling potatoes. They crunch to perfection and hardly need the dipping sauces that accompany.  To be honest, I've never been impressed with the service. But I'm still giving them 5 stars. Their happy hour is one of the best in Phoenix and they have enough going on for them that as long as the mediocre service isn't disrupting my enjoyment of a glass of wine, then we're good.

Nordstrom Cafe earns every single star. This is not your typical mall food, nor is it fast food. While the prices might be what you'd expect from Nordstrom, the food and service are so worth it. And there is something about nursing a glass of Malbec midday in a department store that feels extremely satisfying. Something like  "yes, my friend this is the good life. Shall we have a tipsy stroll around the mall then?"  I somehow always end up hungry around the late morning time frame when they still have so their breakfast/brunch special going and the omelets are always amazing. If I'm not catching their breakfast at the tail end, I go with one of their exquisite salads. A recent special was salmon cakes with spring greens which my hubby ordered and I got the grilled shrimp with corn and arugula. I'm starting to drool now just remembering it. Light, flavorful and not doused with a bottled dressing. Absolutely perfect.   The service is always extremely professional and they work very hard. There is really nothing about this cafe I don't like, except for maybe having to walk by the cute dresses to get there which usually ends in a purchase. *Sigh.*

I am one lucky hummus-sasbi-falafel-lovin' chica to be able to be about a 7 minute walk to Sahara. It's worth the venture from far away places to seek out this jewel. It would be worth the gas anyway because it's inexpensive and 100% delicious. The menu is standard middle eastern fare with great vegetarian choices, but all consistently tasty. Since I'm such a carb fiend, I'll mention that the pita and rice are perfect.  On top of serving up some super saucy dishes, the owner and family are SO incredibly nice and friendly. Your second trip there will feel like some rite of passage, because he'll recognize you and you'll feel like you're sitting at the family table. I'd probably feel like a bad person if I said the food didn't taste good because they are so nice. The comfortable setting, lovely staff and delicious food make this an altogether wholesome experience. Mmmmm.

Do I even need to write a review after all the raving comments here? Maybe not, but I feel like my dining experience will be complete when I officially give Roka Akor props for such a fantastic meal.   Lots of veggie options is a must for me, which is why I was so excited by their menu. While they only have one veggie roll - which is more delicious that any veggie roll I've ever eaten - they have so much more. From the burnt tomato salad to the butternut squash tempura....throw in a few broccolini and asparagus skewers and this veg head was in veg heaven. Beautiful presentation, beautiful flavors. I love the mesquite taste the food takes from the robata. My omnivore companions were drooling over their sushi and we were all floored by the rice hot pot. So many mushrooms!   The removal of one star was due to the unfavorable attitude of the hostess - Honey, I'm not here to spend $50 on a meal and dine in a way that is convenient for you. Thanks for finally giving in and seating us outside at 9pm when the weather was gorgeous. Why did we have to insist when the patio was still open and all the tables were set?  No matter - our experience with her was done in a jiffy. I think I'm still high on truffle oil and enokis or something, cuz I want to go again - like tonight.

This is an absolutely must in December.  We have gone every year for the past 4 years and it seems to improve each year. Though I wish they would bring some of the musicians back from previous years (more bluegrass!), changing it up keeps it interesting as well. The variety of music is fun and makes for a nice walk around the gardens.  Depending on the seasonal sculpture exhibit, the gardens are absolutely lovely at night. Some years have been fairly ordinary with the exhibit not really enhanging the experience. However this year is utterly stunning with Chihuly glass scattered throughout the gardens and even lit up! Truly beautiful and a perfect way to showcase desert landscape to visitors. Strolling around with your family clutching hot cocoa or cider (perhaps with some Jameson or Baileys) and listening to carolers or big band swing is a classic experience all Arizonans should have.   This is also one of the DBG's largest fundraisers, so it's important to show support for such a wonderful place in the middle of the city. It's doses of nature like this that keep me sane!

Enormous! Compared to the Chapparal Dog Park, this one is like a whole canine planation with dogs running around for acres on end. Ok maybe not that big, but really large with lots to sniff. Which is really what you care about when you have an ADD bloodhound with a hyperactive nose. The people there are usually really cool and you might even feel like a parent at a kid park socializing with the other mommies while they prance around and chase or hump each other. It's nice to have a human to chat with while your pup runs around.  There are a couple of strange peeps (more than avid dog lovers) here along you may run into the self-appointed dog-park police who will not hesitate to tell you to pick up your dog's crap or let you know that your dog is not playing nice, but pay no attention. There is no actual dog park po-po. On the whole, this a great place to let 'em loose for a while and wear them out.

Well since we come here every morning, might as well give this cute lil park some props! I love living in this neighborhood and having a safe, clean park definitely adds to it. It's a great place to bring my pup, even though she stays on the leash. There are usually other dogs to socialize with or families with curious kids dying to give her a good belly rub.  I do love that there are bags provided to clean up after dogs and I always see a couple of cleaning crew peeps here to spray down the sidewalks and playground. Good job Phoenix, keep it up!

Not my ball of seaweed. Yep, chain, went in with lowered expectations. Tried to adjust the bar accordingly knowing it wouldn't be as cheap as some of my favorites or as innovative as the more expensive places. But I still wanted a mediocre experience and a decent happy hour.  I was underwhelmed even for expecting mediocre. Though the ingredients themselves tasted ok, the sushi was not wrapped well. Falling apart at the touch, it left us with sloppy soy solution invaded by floating what-nots that spilled off the tops and insides of our rolls. Not to toot my horn, but I'm no chop-stick novice, this wasn't a lack of form on my part. Overkill on the mayo and underkill on the take-away impression.  Would I ever go back? Sure. If a coworker schedules a happy hour here, if an acquaintance to whom it would be inappropriate to warn against choosing such a place plans a birthday party here, I'll go.

A little underwhelmed, a little over stimulated, but I wouldn't fight my friends or refuse to show up if they planned a happy hour here. The identity crisis between sports bar and sushi bar was a little distracting to me - we sat outside where TVs were playing some sporting event, but inside seemed more like Feng Shui-ed. The restrooms were highly entertaining with remote controlled toilets and sensor activated zen inspiring pebble sinks; if I wasn't so hungry I probably would have spent more time in there playing with the gadgets.   We unfortunately had just missed happy hour, but I could see how the slashed prices may be somewhat redeeming. The menu had some pretty decent veg options. However, the tofu lettuce wraps had a sour funk that smelled like feet. They didn't taste much better either so I'd steer clear of those if I were ever to stumble on the occasion where I had no choice but to dine here. I'll admit the veggie roll was actually tasty, not enough to make me a loyal patron though.  I've had better food. I've had better atmosphere. I've spent less money on mediocre sushi. I left feeling satiated, but after trying to wash those lettuce wraps down with sake, I still had to brush the sour feet out of my mouth when I got home.

This is a very good trail for hikers of all levels, which is why we almost always take our out-of-town guests here rather than some other trails around town. Parking is easy (except perhaps for some very busy windows), no special equipment or even fancy shoes are really required, and the scene is a very good showcase of Arizona beauty. You can run it, walk it, or take it in at a leisurely pace.  While there are just a couple of steep sections mostly at the start, the climb isn't rough at all and the trail is very well established. It's fairly wide throughout, so it accommodates a couple of people in each direction. It is a "there and back" rather than a loop, which is actually nice for people who may not want to make the whole trek or for less active hikers that may tire more easily. While you may encounter some runnners, most people know proper trail etiquette (we all know there are some party poopers out there but they are few and far between).   The only feature I wish were different is the dog policy. With the popularity of the trail, I understand the restriction and it is easier to keep clean this way, but I do miss my four-legged friends. For being a quick drive from town, this is a terrific go-to hike.

I walked into Cafe Monarch and knew instantly how my dream kitchen would look, how my dream restaurant would be laid out and how my dream clientele would be. We had called in advance to see if Chris could prepare a vegan meal, a request he gladly obliged, and we were welcomed warmly in various ways: 1) A lovely greeting from Chris, excited to meet the vegan with additional questions about how food can be prepared, 2) prompt opening of our bottle of red to get us started, 3) a cozy seat by the fire outside while he prepared appetizers.  The food was fresh and delicious, though I think he may have been timid and slightly insecure about not being able to cover anything on my plate with cheese. After an hour long post-dinner chat about vegan cooking secrets, he was (dare I say) excited about the idea of trying something completely new in the kitchen. So regardless of the food, which sounds odd because that's the main component of many of our reviews here, his contagiously friendly personality, openness and fervor for food were worth many more stars than this rating system will allow. Bravo and I can't wait to go again.

Well it almost feels redundant at this point after 168 reviews posted for Sens, but for the love of sriracha this place was spectacular! Once I got over the drool from reading the menu and actually tried several of the vegetarian options, I started scheduling my next visit. Holy thai basil, the flavors were impressive. The taste was comforting and exotic at the same time and the dishes very visually pleasing.  The house infused vodkas and shochu are delicious. Paired with the swanky semi-punk vibe, you've got a nice cocktail to wash down that sesame tofu. I did take one star for the disappointing okra. Is that fair to take away a whole star for a vegetable nobody like anyway? I don't know. I love okra and I'm sad it wasn't given a fair presentation.   I'll definitely be bringing my out-of-towners here to show case the fancy food and funky atmosphere in Phoenix.

I'm not really a sandwich snob, maybe I'm a little bit of a bread snob. And I don't eat meat, so clearly there is a certain scope to my review that will not cover a wide array of their menu.  However, my review is not focused so much on their menu as it is on their ingredients. Reality check: I know it's a chain. I don't expect Simply Bread or McClendon carrots. But the disappointment is still high.  The sign is so pretty, their logo is pleasing. But I don't like the flashing of a "healthy eating" concept when your bread is made with high fructose corn syrup among other unpronounceable items and I am not so partial to soggy sandwiches that fall apart even though there isn't any sauce or cheese present (why exactly is every sandwich I've ordered so wet? do they dry the lettuce after washing it? do they wash the bread?) I haven't really encountered any nice people working here to make up for the lacking food at high prices. Not to mention I thought this location in particular was not well kept.  So why 2 stars? I don't know. My only 1 star review was REALLY bad. This wasn't quite as appalling so I've left it at 2. I wish we had Panera here. It's not perfect, but it's a step up.

When relocating from Arcadia to Scottsdale last year, the Green Belt was one of the only saving graces for me. It is a truly wonderful feature here that you don't find in most other parts of town and maintained with impeccable care to boot. It stretches through Scottsdale for miles and miles, lending well to dog walks, bike rides, leisurely jogs, picnics, you get the idea. Now that we live about a quarter mile from the paved pathway, the pups and I walk here just about every day and I couldn't be more grateful for the fresh air and greenery!   I take all of my visitors who believe Phoenix is a brown, flat desert on a jaunt through the park and will even consider setting up a bicycle rental next time so we can head to a few restaurants accessible from the pathway (i.e. The Vig McCormick Ranch, Pig & Pickle, Carlsbad Taverns, etc). This almost makes Scottsdale feel like a pedestrian commuter city :)

This is a wonderful place - great energy, constant support from the staff and other yogis, and inviting atmosphere. The only downfall is its location - since I know where it is, I don't mind it at all. But it did take me 15 minutes to find the first time I tried going. I wish it were a little more visible to peeps that don't know what they're missing!  I am becoming more and more of a regular here. I have enjoyed and been challenged by every class I've taken. Jim has a great attitude and is very encouraging about taking risks or just doing what's comfortable for you. All the instructors are really easy to talk to and guide some pretty stellar classes. I love both the Flow and Power classes. Yin-Yang was a nice surprise...I thought it would be too low-key for me but it was just right and Barb is a gem. One of these days I am actually going to take my lunch break at the studio and go to a Core Power Noon class.  Very affordable and awesome vibes. My confidence in my ability to hold inversion poses grows with every visit. Namaste.

You will fall in love, just like all of us do. Veteran or novice, you'll feel at home even if you don't know what you're getting into. Of all the studios I've practiced in for the past 7 years (which makes me a newbie at most studios), this is the first time I've felt I can truly check my self-conscious ego at the door. No mirrors, low lighting, lofty ceilings and a fabulous instructor.  Tish is so encouraging and enthusiastic that I finally have confidence to try poses I didn't think I could do and am comfortable enough to lay low when I'm feeling my limits. KJ pushed me to take some poses to the next level when I was admittedly a little too lazy to take it up a notch. The class sizes are typically perfect so that you get enough attention when you need it. It feels cozy and familial, I know that when I fall over mid-crow it won't get much notice.  I've finally sucked it up and bought 20 classes. And I'm asking for another package for Christmas!

Just the loveliest gem on a sunny Saturday morning. If you are planning to completely stock your kitchen with veggies and the like, you may want to plan your arrival right at 9:00am. It fills up fast with regulars, so many of the produce options go quickly. The choices in stock wax and wane depending on what's available for the picking, so if you don't find the variety you're looking for, maybe plan to split your time between here and another market. But come here for the experience. Come for the pastries, the coffee, for lunch, a bonfire and live music. This is truly a magical oasis humbly tucked beside the freeway, and a great way to enjoy the weekend.  The greens here are exceptional and usually plentiful. They often have staples like chard, kale or collards some variety of root veggies and lots of citrus. If you're early enough, you'll find carrots, radishes and tomatoes. When you're done shopping, plan to spend some time enjoying the lay of the land. Definitely check out the menu of the day - there is typically soup plus another good plate du jour like pizza or stuffed peppers. I usually come hungry! Be sure to keep an eye out for a lull in the crowd, as the lines get LONG for both coffee and food. Haven't tried the juice stand, but it does look refreshing in warmer months.   If you're into maintaining your own little garden, they also have herbs/plants, compost and mulch for purchase. While it might be slightly pricier than your national home store chain, this is "native" stuff, meaning it's fit for Arizona gardening - important if you actually want your plants to grow. While other formal farmers markets might have a more steady variety of choices, there is nothing like traipsing around the actual farm and getting away from the morning bustle.

I love street food, I love small portions, I love guacamole, I love refried beans - now that you know these things about me, now that I've revealed the Latina part of my soul that burns under this German facade, it's really not hard to see why this place would get 5 stars from this chica. They do all of the above perfectly. If you are looking for an enourmous, sloppy, flavorless burrito combo plate with a large diet coke, this is not your gig.   Looking back, I feel like they possibly took a long time to serve our food, but it's probably because I was sipping fizzy orange vodka that has tampered my memory, not to mention I wanted to nosh real bad. Our waiter was sweet and incredibly busy, so as long as my glass was full, I was feliz. Might have to hop the light rail for a verdura taco tonight, cuz I just can't get my veggies to taste like that at home.

Ring me out and hang me up to dry. That is the drenched sentiment walking out of class - through a set sequence and flow, you get in tune with your breath, ask your body to do what it needs to hit the reset button, and come out feeling like you've gone through a personal rinse cycle (mentally and physically). It's lovely, rejuvinating and best of all consistent - making it worth each and every sweaty minute.  I've been to a couple of different Sumits locations, but I  really like this space. It's a very large room with decent acoustics and pretty good airflow. When the room is 100 degrees with 60% humidity, those brief moments when the door opens mean a lot. Sure some people can tough it out and practice far away from them, but I've been practicing for 11 years and still rely on those gusty breezes to restore my focus in class. The only thing unreliable elememt is how often each teacher actually opens them - some do more than others.  The sequence is really well put together and the emphasis on only doing what your body needs on any given day is a reassuring message that circulates throughout class. If it's too much, there is no barrier in getting into child's pose for as long as you need it. Come Savasana, pretty much every thing in you has dripped out in sweat and it's probably the most peaceful 2 minutes you'll have in your day!

Underwhelmed. Perhaps it's my fault for having high expectations based on others' reviews and based on the veg friendly menu. Plus I had my heart set on adding another joint to my "dog friendly" collection of hang outs. But I left wishing for better food, better drinks and a smaller bill.  The hummus was dry and a bit chalky. The pita was stale. The white balsamic "vinaigrette" was viscous and had some seriously strong onion business going on. The fish and fries were decent - my dining companion admitted they were very well prepared albeit with maybe a pat or 2 of too much butter. The "seasoned vegetables" as listed on the menu was misleading - I took that to mean a plural variety of vegetables. But it meant a whole head of broccoli. Mmk. The cucumber martini was gross, that's as objective as I can put it. Sour? In a cucumber martini? I thought that might be a typo for Sake. But it turned out to be a good way to ruin 3 oz of vodka and a plump refreshing slice of cucumber.  The service was ok, the atmosphere was alright. But I didn't feel the food or drink were priced appropriately for the quality. The menu looks so lovely with all it's meatless fare and fresh sounding ingredients, but I felt a kind of emptiness after dining here. One that no french fry alone can fill.   Would I return? If it were not my decision, I would return to meet friends here or attend an event. And I will order something else on the menu with full hopes of a new and better impression. But the impression I got from this meal was "recession, I guess they must be feeling it in the kitchen too."

Magical, purely magical. Why would I even attempt to make pico de gallo myself anymore when I could buy a quart for all of $3? I wouldn't, and I won't ever again. One of the many staples I'll be picking up from this amazing wonderland going forward.  If you're even contemplating throwing a taco party, as I am want to do from time to time, just poke your head in here and you'll be convinced you should. From fresh tortillas, delicious ceviche and salsas galore, nearly everything is better than you could possibly get in any other store. The one exception I found is the guacamole - I'm not a fan, way too sour. But I won't hold it against them, as it's easy enough to make at home. We even tried out a few of the seasoned meats from the butcher and were not disappointed. Staples like hot sauce, spices and dried peppers are SO inexpensive here! And the selection...guh. So. Many. Choices.  While I've ventured into the bakery, it's not a feature I spend a lot of time on - tried the rolls for sliders, but they were a tad dry. Still functional, but not my favorite. The fish section was...interesting, also not something I'll probably spend money on at this particular venue. But the produce is fabulous if you need limes in bulk (margaritas!) and super huge avocados are always in season apparently. Pretty sure this place will be making it into my regular grocery rotation until this household is sick of tacos...aka, never.

Pour me a glass and bake me a pie, cuz I'm gonna be here for a while.  Though humble and almost unnoticeable on the outside, Parlour has a beautiful interior with great acoustics. Lots of bustling ambient noise to make you feel like you're part of a scene but spaced out enough that you don't have to listen to your neighbor's conversation. Relaxed enough that you can stay a while as well. They've done a terrific job with the design and decor, which contibutes to it's "chill" factor.  The food has always been excellent. Even without cheese, these pizzas are stellar. Anything with those roasted wild mushrooms piled on top is worth ordering. They once had a vegan appetizer special that was to die for and I've been waiting for it's reappearance. The wine and cocktails are very enjoyable - and I'm not a cocktail person. These bartenders know what they're doing.   That last star didn't quite make the cut because of the spotty service. Not terrible service, just somewhat inattentive and aloof, though I'm starting to think that's a trend in hip Phoenix restaurants. Overall, I love it here. For the price and the atmosphere, it's a terrific place to spend a few hours chatting up a storm.

Quit taking all my money. Seriously.  I have to budget now for these clothes, but wow are they worth it. Never have I been a brand-oriented person, and I really don't like paying retail price for anything. But for someone that practices yoga 6 days a week, these clothes are a must. They fit perfectly, don't bunch in weird places when you're upside down and (maybe least important but worth mentioning) they are super cute! Honestly the most sturdy, comfortable, built-for-women activewear out there.  Believe me, I've waivered and gone through the "I'm just gonna get the cheap leggings at Target" argument with myself. But imposter versions fade and rip after 2 months; it ends up costing the same. If you don't practice that often, maybe you don't need the investment. But if you're a regular yogi, shop here.

I wanted to like this place SO badly and throw it into my weekend morning routine. Cute (from the outside) local joint, dog friendly patio, about a mile's walk from my house, beer on tap...but it's just not working. At all. The 4 star-rating as averaged on Yelp was pretty misleading unfortunately.  The interior is a little dank, which is fine if you're not into atmosphere. Not that I think every coffee shop should scream corporate remodel, but there is a way to tastefully execute shabby-chic and then there is disheveled. It's kind of like the island of misfit coffee shop decor found its way here rather than a cute modgepodge of retro sweet consignment finds that could potentially make this look work. The furniature was definitely wobbly and the patio setup a little awkward. Nice to have water bowls for the pups though.  Design aside - the coffee was terrible. Just terrible. The brewed coffee tasted like hot water that happen to be brown. The "americano" was equally tasteless. After receiving the full bakery tour (including a detailed explanation of every item provided free of charge by the eager barista), I settled on the almond poppyseed muffin. Not bad - but pretty crumbly. The dogs liked it at least. My hubby's bagel sandwich looked like it was going to be our best bet. Le sigh. A quick lift of the top exposed what appeared to be rubber cheese - you know the kind. When I argued that perhaps they used quality sliced cheddar, my hubs replied "I made enough grilled cheese as a bachelor to know what a Kraft single tastes like." No rebuttal. And no returning.

How could a review of 5th and Wine have escaped me? We've been coming here pretty much since they opened and have enjoyed every visit. Given the prime location in the middle of Old Town, it is one of the only budget-friendly wine bars that still maintains a delicious menu, great choices for vino and a welcoming ambience.   Inside seating is very enjoyable with some nights of live music sprinkled throughout the week, but the patio is where I typically hunker down. The wine selection for happy hour is stellar and the noshes totally hit the spot. Fried pickles please! Oh, and and extra order of Mac N Cheese is usually on the dockett. The sheer number of vegetarian and fish choices is a relief compared to many of its similarly-priced Scottsdale peers, and how nice to be stumped by indecision! What I really love is that the patio accommodates groups very well and is dog-friendly, so I can let my hound dog chill here while I catch up with friends over vino.  Cherry on top? Service is super friendly. I don't think there is anything about this place I don't like. Well ok, there have been quite a few smooth jazz nights for my liking, but as I mentioned - I'm usually too busy chatting it up on the patio, so it hardly bothers me. I haven't been for brunch yet, but I will be soon!

I'm still feelin the love. A most wonderful combination found I today of simple delightful food, a laid back atmosphere, warm staff, dog-friendly accommodations, a vegan-friendly menu and... oh yeah... all day Monday Happy Hour.    Thank you TMI for the immediate bowl of water set down for my hound, the speedy $4 glass of red, and a yummy manageably-sized veg sandwich. I couldn't have asked for a better ending to this much dreaded Monday. It was lovely winding down and enjoying the sunset while other suckers waited in traffic.  I second Sarah G's enthusiasm for Sophie's salad sans mozzarella. Mmmm mmmm arthichoke. My next mission is the Cash Money sammie with house made cashew butter (wha?!) Cabernet jelly AND bananas. It's like Elvis met Sophia Lauren and decided to class it up. Soon will I be back to attempt such an adventure. Very soon.

I am typically wary of both Fox concepts and bigger chain establishments in Old Town, but there are a few I keep in my back pocket for fail-safe night out options. Culinary Dropout is one of them. The experience is always positive, the food is typically satisfactory and the drinks hit the spot.  The decor at this location is rustic, contemporary and lovely at the same time with a wide open space laced with wood accents. Live music is a nice touch and makes for a decent ambient sound when enjoying drinks with your party. I have really enjoyed the cocktails I've ordered here, which gives me confidence in their bartenders. Happy hour is great time to go with lower prices and decent options. Although I wasn't thrilled with the grill cheese sliders and their rubbery faux-american cheese aftertaste, but the salad of the day hit the spot. I've also had the burrata which was a true indulgence down to the last bite.  The staff has always been very friendly here whether it's behind the bar or table service. Even I have to admit this Fox concept is executed perfectly and is in my stand-by Old Town rotation.

Thank goodness there is a place like this as an alternative to some of the other nightlife in Scottsdale. Love the dark speakeasy feel and the decor - makes me feel like getting all dolled up to curl up in a booth with my honey. There is ususally a terrific vibe whether the place is tame during happy hour or packed on late nite weekends. It does get crowded most weekends after 10:30pm, so if you don't do crazy or loud, plan accordingly.  The food is decent. The fact that Happy Hour extends so late is a big bonus, but I wouldn't call the food extraordinary. The drinks are usuaslly lovely and they have some very talented, fun bartenders. Their mixed drinks are definitely pricey, so I usually stick to vino. But damn this place make me want bourbon, Mad Men style.

Can't come here for a quick stop. I'll get distracted, or rather attracted to some random section that has 10 different books I have to page through on the spot. I can't hold it against the place obviously, but I have a hard time controlling myself! So many books, so little cost. Not to mention a cozy, quiet atmosphere conducive to losing track of time.  Love the cooking and health/fitness sections. I'm never looking for anything in particular, but I always find something that I may or may never read. What does it matter when it's $5? Sure I'll become a master of my personal finances someday now that I have a book on it. I might also learn a thing or two about chakras. But I'll probably have read most of it in the store before I even buy it.   Sometimes I page through the old school cd's too - you never know when that Ace of Base album will spark some kind of early 90's craving in your heart. But isn't that the essence of this store? Do I NEED any of this? No, but it's an affordable pleasure. That's hard to find in this crappy economy; I indulge.

Loved every minute. That's not to say I could spend every minute of the day here, because it's a LOT to take in and at some point most of the music blurred together simply from my own exhaustion. Despite my own fatigue, the museum is a beautiful tribute to the diverse music of the globe.  The exhibits are exceptionally laid out. Before my adventure here I was advised to "not spend too much time in Africa" because there is so much more that follows and it may wear you out. I would heed that advise next time. I wouldn't skip any of it, but I'd juggle my time around a bit more instead of making my way thru each region in an organized manner.  I was so impressed with the footage and audio capabilities. It really allows the visitor to feel immersed in a sound, voice or image.Though I'm not much of a museum person, I will come again. This is a fabulous stop for out of town visitors and a great way to showcase the activies we have for everyone in the valley. Bravo. Encore.

After a couple of visits and a strong hope for the start of a loyalty punch card program since I plan on returning for breakfast every weekend, I feel I can confidently give PomCafe 5 stars. The food and atmosphere satisfy everything I look for in a cute, neighborhood cafe that is trying to promote not only health but the idea that health tastes GREAT.   The buckwheat english muffin has sent me on a frenzy to find a recipe and bake it myself at home because it was perfect for that lumberjack sammie. The raw collard wrap I had for lunch today was an unexpected slam dunk - hello almond cheese! And I second other reviewer's prop for the orange juice. I want to buy a juicer now.  Answer your temptation at the raw bakery, trust me. Though the only semblance the raw donuts have of a real one is the shape, they still taste delicious. Chocolate cherry "cheese" cake? One of my co-diners actually had dessert for breakfast because it was too hard to pass up.  So far I have found no reason to dock points. I will keep returning though with solid determination to get to the bottom of each plate in search of any hint of disappointment. I'm fairly certain I won't find it though.

It deeply saddens me to have to write a review like this for a restaurant that finally offers a menu from which I have choices. I am a vegan and self-professed health nut and was very much looking forward to trying absolutely everything on this menu. Now that I've tried a good chunk of it, my heart has drifted from the illusion that a swanky atmosphere and a menu dotted with "gf"s and "v"s will always be indicative of sheer, healthy brilliance. Nay.  My first visit was the height of the romance. I was so excited by the idea of choice that I tried as much as I could on a mildly empty stomach - the confetti veggies, salsa of the day, and mango avocado salad...at the time my enthusiasm tricked me into thinking it was all light and delicious, but as I walked away I had to be honest with myself. There was hardly anything on that confetti veggie salad, the salsa tasted like it came from a jar with some pineapple chunks thrown in, and they forgot to include the "Nourish Energy Mix" greens in my spicy mango avocado salad. This girl likes greens, what do I have to do to get a little leaf around here?  I was willing to clear the slate for my second visit. I wanted to try more items and have a better experience. This is a new joint and I am a new customer, I wanted to be a patron! Nay. To advertise that their bacon has no nitrates but then to use sulfured apricots in the quinoa salad - I don't know how to convey my confusion. The fruit salad looked like it came from the bottom of a bowl that had been sitting for 2 days - pink pineapple and brown kiwi. What really got to me was the "wild rice" - I'm from Minnesota, home of wild rice, and this is not wild rice. This is brown rice with a few wild grains studded throughout and it was so salty that it tasted like it came from a Rice a Roni box. I'm so sad that I wrote that, but it's true!  I'll sign off on a more positive note...the sweet potato fries were delicious and light. I have not tried the sandwiches or burgers yet, mostly because the portions looked huge. But I will probably come back to try one for the sake of having a complete experience. I wish for a better representation of what healthy cuisine has to offer - I know the spirit of Nourish is on the right track. I just hope the deliver catches up.

Someone once told me that if you're going to preface a sentence with "It goes without saying.." then you should probably say it. So despite the plethora of superstar reviews, I am going to chip in and echo the feedback this magnificent food truck deserves.   Meatless dogs should taste like, well... meaty dogs. Let's face it, real hot dogs have a je ne sais quoi about them because you pretty much don't know what is in them. While I can't speak to the quality of the real meat hot dogs which are probably higher quality that Oscar Meyer and likely consist of real meat, I can tell you that buying veggie dogs from the store will never suffice again. No it's not that the roll of mystery non-meat is a superb mockup of actual meat, it's the furnishings. Who the heck thought of delicately and lovingly wrapping this cylindrical American staple in a fabulously plush piece of exotic non-American naan? These guys.   As for the toppings, I am so indecisive about choosing among the incredibly delicious options that I typically just tell them to surprise me so long as it's not bacon. Blue cheese? Well usually I'm vegan, but for this...yes. Cabbage? Um yes. And whatever that is on that guy's hot dog before me, I want that too. I have never finished consuming one of these hot dogs wanting anything more from life at that moment. So while "it goes without saying," it's worth being said over and over. This is yum.

I've been coming here for the past couple of months - two thumbs up, supoprted by my glowing biceps and toned shoulders. Ok maybe I'm not THAT buff, but it's undeniable that I've seen physical change and improvement in my muscle tone. This workout is intense, challenging and completely addicting if you like to push yourself and don't mind dripping sweat for 60 minutes. Classes are pretty packed, but I don't mind. The music is loud and the pace is energetic.  I've been a yogi for 10 years and am an instructor, so I like the studio atmosphere, but I will echo the feedback from others that instructors won't go out of their way to make you feel welcome if they don't know you or provide personal attention. They are all very nice, but I've never been individually welcomed or made to feel like I'm part of their community. These are things I like from a yoga studio, so maybe it's a barre thing? Not sure, but ultimately I'm on my own journey to a buff bod and I don't need a lot of fluff along the way. I just need someone to yell at me and push me while looking effortless at performing the exercises that I'm pretty sure are going to kill me. When class is over, there is definitely a sense of accomplishment. Sometimes it doesn't sink In until 3 days later though when my muscles have recovered and can support the weight of my body again. Feels good!

Well the proof is in the pudding folks. By "pudding" of course I mean arms, abs and booty plus a whole lot of comments such as "so where did you get those pipes?" I have been to a few other barre studios with plenty of mixed feelings - some workouts too intense to focus on form, others not intense enough to feel like you're working. Pure Barre is the pefect balance between intensity and form and actually produces visible change in your body which is hard to argue with.   After the first couple of classes, I really questioned whether I could keep up with this as a regular exercise habit. So much burning going on! It also took me a bit to get used to what we were actually supposed to be working in some parts of the class. But the instructors are awesome, give verbal cues of where you should feel your muscles working, and provide plenty of adjustments to help you get there. I love the upbeat music, it provides for good distraction when you're holding on for dear life during those last few pulses. I also like that there is periodic stretching between muscle groups, it's a good reset before you go into the next ass kicking. It'd an addicting routine, really.   The price is certainly steeper than other alternatives out there, but considering how effective the workout is and how great the studio vibe is - to me, it's worth the cost if you want a seriously toned bod. Let's be real - you'll spend the same amount of money by the time you combine cheaper classes with supplement scams or a gym membership with a kale smoothie habit. Just get to barre already!

A place to enjoy - not necessarily a culinary shocker but certainly a spot to soak up the Phoenix scene. While I don't typically write reviews after one experience, I feel confident that my ensuing engagements here will be just a pleasant, flavorful, and fulfilling as my sole dining venture.  The setting is lovely, with a generous amount of patio space in addition to the nice layout inside. The community table is a fun spot to sit and cozy up to strangers, eavesdrop or tune others out and enjoy your own company. The waitstaff was nice - nothing out of the ordinary to add there. Though our waiter possibly needs some practice in socializing smoothly with others, I'm tolerant.   The food: very nice. I was not thrown off my chair by any crazy and spectacular flavors, but I really liked what I tasted. The portions were small, which I like because I'm small yet prone to finishing my plate regardless of size. The zucchini pancakes were my favorite, but I'm all about cakes no matter what's in em. The house wine was delicious and oh-so-well priced. Will be back for more, of this I'm sure.

Nom nom nom. In my belly. More Risotto Cakes please!  I'm very happy to have an Herb Box closer to my casa. I was delighted with my first visit to DC Ranch, but the drive is less and less likely to happen at $4 a guzzle. The Southbridge location did not disappoint. Our table on the patio facing the Waterfront was relaxing, beautiful, and perfect for a quiet Monday evening out. The interior was impressive and the bathrooms! A thorough review of the bathroom facilities is always an important part of my dining experience - these banos are sahweet!   Our server was one of the best I've ever had, and I come from a serving background. Very good knowledge and description of the food, perfect timing of table visits and a stellar attitude towards our preference for a snail paced meal.  The best part - those damn risotto cakes that I'm now dreaming about. We tried the pear and gorg pizza as well which was scrumptious and the market salad was so-so. I cannot wait to continue my way down the list of fresh and delicious items on the menu. Lovely, lovely place.

A group of 6 of us were drawn in to this tiny cafe by a road side sign on our drive through Cave Creek. We had been out the night before partaking in Wild West festivities, so crepes sounded like a glorious remedy for our post-bourbon bellies. While the shop is quaint and welcoming, "tiny" is not to be mistaken for an exaggeration. There are 2 or 3 two-person tables inside, and about 4 tables outside, 2 of which can seat a group of our size. With 1 server and 2 crepe griddles, they were not equipped to handle a full house.   The quality of food and beverage was fair. But not enough to forgive the inordinate amount of time spent waiting for it. A simple order for black coffee took more than 20 minutes to arrive, and one of our girls ordered coffee with cream and sugar - it came with the cream and sugar already mixed in. So I guess they have a telepathic barista. As we sipped our coffee, we started feeling more alive. And as we waited for our food...and waited...the coffeee turned our stomachs into grouchy mongers demanding some sort of caloric prey to slience the wrath of a hungry hangover. Yet nothing came. After another half hour, we saw the table next to us who arrived a few mintues prior to our party finally receive out crepes. Super - so with their 2 griddles, about 15-20 minutes later we finally saw and end to the misery.   The crepes were tasty, though some were quite burned on the edges. The filling was simple and hit the spot. The wait however was exceptional. Even the most luxurious meal on the laziest Sunday morning should not call for a near 90 minute wait from sitting at your table to eating your food. Despite a smiling apology, mere words didn't really heal the pain.   My overall takeaway: don't come hungry.

Having moved from a place that churns out Aveda stylists like popcorn out of a popper, I was hesitant to even find a stylist when I came to AZ. Aveda has a huge presence in Minneapolis, and even if you're faithful to one stylist, he or she can pretty much be replaced by another very talented Aveda clone. Not so much in AZ. After a couple of bad attempts to find a good stylist here, I decided my only option was to get my haircut when I went back to MN for a visit.   Until I came to the right stylist at Mood Swings. I tried a couple of people here that didn't work out so well, but when I found Amanda, my "do" was finally "done" right. She gets short hair, she doesn't waste a lot of time and the price isn't as outrageous as Aveda stylists up north. Not to mention she's fun! The other staff members are kind and gracious, making the whole end-to-end experience a good one. Finally I can get by without going to MN every 6 weeks.

Not that this place NEEDS another stellar review, but I'm going to give them one. While I've had my eyes set on this cute little patio for quite some time, I was finally able to enjoy the full experience with my mom last week. And it most certainly filled all of my expectations and then some.  The venue is impossibly cute. With an abundance of shade and draping ivy over the patio, outside is definitely the way to enjoy breakfast here. The inside was also quaint with plentiful seating options, so I'm sure as the season gets busy with good weather, an indoor table would hardly be disappointing. The menu has so many tempting options, the most difficult part of our meal was choosing what to eat. We both chose eggs for our "main" dish, but couldn't pass up the lemon bread pudding with blueberry sauce and creme fraiche. Holy. Mother. of Bread Pudding. I don't know the secret, but this is one of the best edible items my lips have every come across. We ended up taking our eggs to go after splitting the bread pudding because it was so filling AND it would have been a crime to leave one single crumb on the table. The egg dishes were a delightful lunch after our round of golf.  The service was awesome which made for a holistically pleasant breakfast. I can't wait to return for more bread pudding with a side of lunch next time.

Mine eyes hath seen the glory of this vegan bakery, It indulges my most tender taste buds decadently, If I lived a mile closer, I'd have a huge belly, My mouth is munching on!!!!!!  10 stars. I may have a small sense of patriotism towards the Green/Nami powerhouse being vegan, but there are no reasons to take away stars. More like lots of reasons to add stars. The interior at Nami is small, quaint and humble. It overflows with hipsters and yuppies alike not to mention hard rockers and tree huggers. Everyone who is anyone can find something delicious here regardless of the wear and tear of your converse shoes or how long you've been working on your sleeve. If you have the ability to raise a hand to your mouth carrying a donut, you'll leave happy.  We came for Sunday brunch and were filled with too many "mmmmm"s to count. The tofu scramble was perfection and those wings are seriously wing-ding-dang good. The bevvies are delicious and it's probably doesn't even need to be mentioned that the tsoynamis are the best and surest way to fight the 105 degrees outside. Can't wait to come back and get my birthday cupcake here.

The dilapitated carwash-turned-trattoria is a cute concept and was executed well. Almost feels "local" except for the fact that it's a Fox concept restaurant and carries the same inauthentic atmosphere as the rest. They did a very nice job reonvating this space and gave it some great curb appeal. But it lacks the true Arcadia genuineness present at it's neighbors' establishments. It's in the food, it's in the people. It's not in NoRTH.  My experiences have been mixed. The first visit was very nice - just there for some small bites and wine. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were incredibly friendly. Food was slightly above mediocre though incredibly salty and oily. Second visit - not so nice. Called ahead to see if they allowed dogs. The hostess put me on hold to confirm and came back with a yes. When we arrived, we were met with a "um, no." They (the manager) were a little (or a lot) snooty about it, so my third visit took a while to come around. Similar to the first with mediocre results.  The bar is beautious with friendly bartenders, so I haven't even bothered with waiting for a table. The front staff always seems a little annoyed that we're even walking in like "I guess we can be bothered to seat you" which is why we always just help ourselves to the bar. It's close to home with all day happy hour on Sundays (decent wine), so I'll probably be back eventually. But only if I'm eager to have one of those "stumble home in a wine stupor" nights.

I guess the little 'R' icon means I'm a regular here - well I am. Four visits in the last month is about as regular as it gets for me (two of them in the same weekend as requested by my out-of-town visitors). After running along the canal for months seeing the words "Friendly Dog Patio" painted near the back, it was only a matter of time before my pup and I dropped by. We're both big fans!  The wine and beer selections are terrific, and the meatless choices are abundant. Of the hummus, guac, yucca chips, flatbread, veggie burger, fries, arepas, and salads - I have yet to find something that hasn't been delicious. We're not talking epic creative fusion cuisine here, just above-average pub grub. The mixed drinks are okay, but most of them are on the sweet side which isn't my thang. Happy hour prices are spectacular and we've had some stellar service to boot (enough to make up for a couple of service hiccups).  That fifth star awaits the back patio being open during the week. It's glorious with a view facing Camelback Mountain and set under the canal. The front patio view is well...the parking lot. Since I will likely always be outside with my dog, I'd rather not butt up to a piping hot grill. But I will give bonus points for having dog treats and a canine watering station. Woof woof hooray!

This is the kind of shop I live and Yelp for. What brought me here was a hope that I could assemble some sort of local gift basket for my boss. What I found in addition to that was an amazing source of local staples I could at a very practical level come here for regularly. Eggs? Jerusalem Artichokes? Queen Creek olive oil in bulk?! Check! The price is a little higher than your average market, but to think that the moola is circulating back to Arizona businesses and growers is encouraging.   Not only are the goods impressive and delicious, but I love how ready they are to chat about wine, chocolate, their farmers, etc. I always want to pull up a chair, order a glass of wine from next door and act like I work there. The focus on Arizona wines has turned this skeptic into a believer by the way. I haven't tried their ready-made snacks or dishes, but they all look amazing (I still have my eyes on that egg salad). I can't wait until I run out of olive oil to return and find more goodies.

I am so happy Brat Haus has stuck around Old Town. Such a wonderful place with good eats, great beer and a phenomenal patio! We actually love it so much we had our engagement party out back in April.  I was fortunate enough to attend an yelp event here some time ago which was my first experience as they were trying to generate some traffic. For a place whose name suggests a very meat centric menu, I was impressed with their vegetarian options. Many events cater to carnivores, and while still fun, it was much more enjoyable to sample a larger variety of the menu. The French fries are delicious and it's totally acceptable if not encouraged to have fries and beer as a complete meal. The pretzels were kind of stale at first taste but I've ordered them since and they were much fresher and softer. The mustard options are plentiful! 6 mustard choices deserves it's own star.  The patio truly is one of my favorites in town. Lovely even in the summer (thanks some kind of futuristic uber fan) and provides plenty of entertainment. Our engagement party guests especially loved playing ping pong and tether ball. Our food included veggie sliders, meat sliders, and the kale salad. The veggie sliders were a little underwhelming as far as texture and flavor goes, but overall the food was great. The service is what really soared above expectations. They handled a group of 40 with so much attention and friendliness. I think I may just have my birthday party here as well!

One of my most notable New Year's resolutions is to become a local at Pig & Pickle. Given the unassuming location at Hayden & Thomas, you wouldn't expect much from a restaurant in those parts. Yet it's a hop, skip and a jump from our house and it doesn't involve going into Old Town. I couldn't be more delighted with how much this place actually rocks as a humble yet trendy gastropub with fantastic eats and tasty booze. There is more resemblance to a neighborhood, pacific northwest eatery here than your typical Scottsdale overpriced, politely mediocre restaurant - which is precisely the appeal. As such, I will be returning on my cruiser for happy hour as often as I can.  As a pescatarian, I wouldn't have though there would be many options on the menu at a pork joint, but alas P&P delivers! With plenty of satisfying veg and seafood choices, I have yet to meet something here that isn't delicious. On a dreary winter night, the squash soup and tots were just the ticket to warming up my frozen bones. The brussel sprouts are also to die for and could convert any cruciferous hater out there with that runny yolk pouring all over the golden and crispy deliciousness. I can't wait to try the shrimp and grits next time. It seems there is quite a rotation to the menu as well, which always keeps things interesting.  The cocktail and beer menus are just as impressive and satisfying as the food. While the Amish Mule was just a tad sweet for my liking, it was a refreshing pick. The Vesper knocked me on my bum for a while, so needless to say it was damn good. The bartenders are super friendly and laid back - I'll be hard pressed to sit at an actual table any time in the future. Plus, if I am to obtain my goal of becoming a local, a seat at the bar is essential. Looking forward to my next visit!

What a fabulous day. We arrived at the start to avoid parking chaos, long food lines and of course to get first dibs on the goodies. So much fun stuff! Terrific samples from Humble Pie, Postino, St. Francis, Pizza People and Green. It was like free lunch! Washed it down with a lovely taste of Souvia Tea while listening to live music in the sunshine. Terrific afternoon.  I came home with a whole boat load of soap from Strawberry Hedgehog, free samples for my pooch including about 6 packets of dog food and 9 different treats, plus many more coupons in the free tote to dole out during post-Fall Festival holiday shopping. This felt like such a warm and friendly community gathering. It's like Phoenix is bucking up and generating a real local scene! Love it and can't wait for next year's festival.

This place was a Godsend while we moved into our new home. With no way to prepare meals due to a kitchen project under way, we were in fairly constant need of a quick, light option for take out. Success at the ChopShop! It was such a relief to have something this close to home with healthy options and quick service.  The menu is versitile and allows for easy customizations. I've always ordered the salads, but I have yet to try one I don't like. The tofu isn't too bad, though it's a little on the squishy side rather than the crispy/firm side. The dressings are light and lovely to boot. The sandwiches are actually quite large. My hubby seemed to enjoy his sandwich with the only comment being the bread was a tad dry, but he really loves the chocoalte peanut butter shake with espresso. He rarely even orders a chewable meal from here anymore.  I haven't tried the breakfast options and while there aren't that many, they look delicious. Juice and drink options are great with a fabulous tea selections. When it's busy the take out orders have been a little slow, but that's to be expected. It appears dogs are welcome on the patio which is always a plus! Overall I strongly recommend this place for a quick and light bite that appeases any diet.

Wine on tap? I think that's an automatic 5 stars. Went to EVO for a mid-week happy hour and was not in the least disappointed. We sat at the bar for drinks and snacks and could not have been more content with the experience.  The happy hour menu is slightly short on the edible choices for a vegetarian, but they happily made the arancini with marinara instead of meat sauce and were totally cool with splitting a pizza half meat/half veg. Our bartender was so sweet and accommodating, we even got 2 rounds of pretty addicting ciabatta and olive oil as we wrapped up our second glass of beverages. I love that the red wine is served lightly chilled, just the way I like it!  Though in a rather inconspicuous location that has been somewhat of a revolving door for restaurants in the past year or so, I truly hope EVO breaks the streak and stays for good. The low-lighting, speakeasy atmosphere is romantic and laid back at the same time. The crowd is energizing without being invasive. And being only 2 miles away, I hope to become more of a regular before EVO becomes too trendy in Old Town :)

This is so my kind of place. I'm not even what you'd consider a "country girl" but the laid back, fun-loving scene with tasty beer, grub and music is totally my style. For some reason I've seem to be into taking my cowboy boots everywhere and have fallen in love with the western scene, so I like to drag my kicks out on the dance floor for some dancin. The live music is great and people are totally down to boogie. Not in the bump n gridn kinda way you see all over Old Town, but in the get your ugly funk on kinda way.  The food is definitely southwestern comfort food. Not a whole lot in the way of meatless fare, but I've only eaten here once. The deep fried grilled cheese was, well...exactly what you'd expect. Pretty good. Love me some shoestring fries and I could probably just have those for a whole meal. The jalapeno mac n cheese was surprisingly spicy in a good way. Beer and wine selections are both terrific. This spot is totally becoming a regular weekend hangout!

This small little green eatery is a great alternative to the many waist-unfriendly choices in the area. With a versatile menu open to customization, pretty much any eater could find something delicious here. It definitely has that "healthy" vibe that screams, "Stop here for a post-gym replenishment! If you weren't at the gym, at least put on some yoga pants!" which seems to deter some more traditional folks. But I hope it continues to attract a large dining crowd.  The food is simple and delicious. I've enjoyed a few of their salads, and I would definitely recommend requesting dressing on the side. I not only found them to be generously poured when added in advance, but they were a little sweet for my taste. My husband loves the quinoa bowls and finds them sufficient in actually squashing his appetite - a rare feat at most health-centric dining venues. He's also praised their smoothies, a treat I have yet to experience.  My only other concern and hesitation toward coming here more often is the time it takes from ordering to eating. It appears as though everything is mostly cooked in advance and ready for assembly, yet it took almost a half hour the last time we grabbed lunch on a Saturday. The menu may have a variety, but none of it is complicated. If they devise some sort of system to improve the wait time, the whole implication behind grabbing something to go (as the name suggests) will be much more true to form.

Scottsdale needed this place badly - or perhaps I needed this place badly since moving from Phoenix to Scottsdale! Little dose of hipster, lovely tastes for a foodie, laid back vibe, chill employees. These are the things you find all over CenPho, but a rare breed East of 68th street. I plan on spending many weekend afternoons here drinking day beers. The decor and open layout make for a very inviting atmosphere that begs for both happy hour banter and solo study time.   The menu is small and simple, but everything looks and sounds amazing. The kale salad was light and refreshing without being overly doused in dressing. I would however recommend more chickpeas as there were only about 10 in total. My hubs loved the hummus sandwich. It came with chips and slaw, and while I typically love vinegar based cabbage slaws like this, this one was average. We both indulged in the peanut butter cookies which definitely satisfied our sweet craving. I can't wait to try that cinnamon coffee cake with a big cup of coffee soon.   The beer. Whoa. What a selection! I enjoyed a Lil Sumpin' Wild on tap which never ceases to amaze my mouth. I hope they start a loyalty punch card soon or some kind of beer club, because I'd be all over that. They do have a couple of wines by the glass, so fear not - all are welcome, including canines. The patio is dog friendly, so we of course brought our pups who loved the attention. With such a terrific concept and execution overall, I have high hopes that this place will thrive and pull in a fun crowd!

The Valley has an abundance of pretty delicious pizza, so it's hard to stray from some of your current favorites to check out anything unfamiliar. But I am so incredibly glad to have met Pomo and its delicious pies from Napoli. Having spent quite a bit of time in Italy (mostly eating) and having never met a true Italian pizza in the US - this place has moved up several notches on my preferred pizza scale given its authenticity. My perfect pizza is one with perfectly, gently burnt crust and the perfect (aka light) amount of sauce to toppings ratio - one that begs for a glass of wine. Ecco-la.  The Scottsdale location is lovely.The inside looks delightful and inviting, though I've only enjoyed the patio which is also extremely pleasant. Excellent wine choices for the vino lovers and the menu has something delicious for anybody or any mood. The Mista salad was refreshing and simple (though a tad heavy on the dressing). Both the Bufala and Ortolana pizze were fantastic. We were lucky enough to enjoy Pomo's personal pizzas at the Italian Festival last weekend - a staff member told us the owner's mother made all the dough for the festival the night before. Sure enough she was rolling it out right there per order! Their ability to make a pie on the fly that was just as good as those served at the restaurant was very impressive.  Bravo Pomo. Bravissimo!

I really love this place, it's hard to know where to start in describing exactly why. The original location is super cool, but this spot takes the cake. Not to mention Old Town badly needs a laid-back hideout for those of us that don't jive comfortable with the normal Scottsdale crowds in the area (i.e. bros and blue hairs). They've done a phenomenal job turning this into a slightly hipster but not at all pretentious hangout. They even let me host a co-ed "baby shower" there without judging - and our waiter ROCKED.  First of all, the patio is fabulous when the weather is nice. They have misters of course for hotter days, and it's dog friendly. The inside has a super cool vibe with amazing wall paper and pictures of coal miners for a cool vintage touch (read the backstory re: pasties). The food is consistently excellent and extremely filling - an excellent reminder to keep up my fitness habit. The meatless menu is huge, though I always order the same thing (mmmm vegan Chicken Tikka Masala). I devoured their fries for the first time last weekend, they were spicy and delicious. The only thing I haven't completely demolished was the Strawberry Pavlova. There was nothing wrong with it at all, it just wasn't chocolate covered in more chocolate so... not really my thing. But fruit lovers would probably really like it. The beer selection is awesome with great local options, and while I haven't tried the cocktails, I've heard good things about those too.  Come here for dinner or just a drink, enjoy the patio or escape the heat inside at the bar - there's not a bad time to visit. This will definitely be on the regular rotation for the foreseeable future!

This. THIS. This is exactly what I've been looking for in a fitness studio. A challenging workout that changes every day, draws a great group of people, and feels welcome to absolutely anybody who is brave enough to walk through the door in voluntary acceptance of a veritable ass kicking. Nikki - you have made this place into something truly fabulous.  The workouts burn. And sometimes I feel like I'm gonna throw my heart up, just a little bit. And sometimes doing an exercise for a 4th round of a mere 30 second interval makes me want to throw my hands up and say "F*#@ it, I'll be fat." But that is oddly what is so addicting with each hour you spend here. It's challenging, but so fast-paced you don't have time to talk yourself out of squeezing out that extra rep. And you're not the only one turning red and puffing at the cheeks. Looking around the room - NO ONE can make this workout look easy or effortless. We all look like we've been passed through a washing machine. It's a group effort.  Though I also purchased the Groupon deal, I anticpate breezing through my 10 classes pretty quickly and defintely plan on being a full fledged member. When you're already a decently fit person, the marvel of being sore after every workout is priceless.

We have already been big fans of the burgers over at LGO, so it was no surprise to be impressed at Ingo with the same deliciousness. The set up is a little unusual with the order window towards the back of the venue, but I like the seating layout a lot. It's fun to sit outside and soak up some sun or lounge in the shade with a brew and some taters.  The food itself was fabulous. The crushed potatoes with labne were extremely tasty - even more so than I had imagined with the wonderfully distinct dip. I thought it was going to taste like any other sour cream or ranch dip, but it was something beautiful in its own right. I enjoyed the tuna burger - the burger itself was pretty good with plenty of avocado a soft spice. I added extra with their homemade fermented jalapeno sauce (totally awesome!). The buns were remarkable with just enough softness to not be mush when you bite. My companion tried the Ingo burger and reported the bun to be a slightly mushy with the saurkraut and mustard sauce dripping on it.  The service was friendly and timely. But the only reason I'm docking a star  is because they've removed the veggie burger. LGO's veggie burger has been my FAVORITE in the valley. I tried ordering it at LGO itself about a week prior to visiting Ingo and was told they no longer have it at the pizzeria, because it's on the Ingo menu. When I ask for it at Ingo, they've taken it off the menu... Do I want a rice bowl? F*&% no I don't want a rice bowl at a burger joint. Please bring my veggie back.

Paid a visit here after the JT concert on Friday night - best decision all weekend. Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.  The ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.  Our waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey.

This is by far my favorite Fox restaurant in terms of decor, menu and vibe. While it's certainly at a higher price point than some of the other concepts, most everything is executed well and seems *worth* the extra cost. Fabulous place to celebrate an occasion/holiday and feel like you're getting more of a casual splurge. The only criticism I'll agree with from the assessment of other reviewers is the incredibly slow service.   The interior is gorgeous, somehow making a nice open space feel cozy and chic at the same time. You have the option of camping out at the bar, relaxing on the adorable couches for more of a happy hour feel or sitting in the main dining area - all are full service. No matter where you sit though, I've found you'll be waiting a while. To be acknowledged, for your waters, your first drink order, any refills, etc. I don't know why such a great place with really nice staff has such. poor. timing. Our servers have always been friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu - it's not a personality issue. Are they just over capacity? Is there some kind of request-x-2-only refill policy on water? We've come here before and sat in the high-top area for 20 minutes before deciding to leave and dine elsewhere - which sucks because I know how great the food and cocktails are.  The food is ridiculously delicious. The warm kale dip is so garlicky good and don't miss out on the popovers. All of the seafood entrees are to die for (I'd choose this over Buck & Rider any day for the price) and that Croissant Bread Pudding is no joke. It's an absolute must regardless of how tight your pants feel after dinner. Wash it down with a cappuccino for a real indulgence. It's worth mentioning that the food itself is served up pretty quickly. I'd love to rate this as 5 stars, but slow service is just too consistent. And I LIKE long, drawn out meals where you're not pressured to leave. I LIKE servers who give you space without checking in every 5 minutes. But conscious, attentive yet considerate service is so different than elusive, hard-to-flag-down service. Sigh...I'll be back again and again, but not if those hunger pangs have already set in.

I would have liked to add this gastropub to our regular rotation given the proximity to our home, but it's not going to make the cut. We didn't experience anything supremely negative or offensive to provoke scathing feedback on food, service or atmosphere. Yet the asking price is just astounding given the quality of all three features.  First, service was very friendly. After some confusion with the hostesses about sitting at the community table, we opted to sit at the bar. The large table commonly referred to as a "community table" isn't actually a table they will seat multiple parties at - an odd policy. The bar inside was full, but the hostess reassured us that the patio was air-conditioned in the summer and very pleasant. So we obligingly headed outside very open minded about their ability to cool the space on a late afternoon in July. We quickly realized it's next to impossible to cool an outdoor patio in the Arizona summer, and, accepting own naiveté, we sat outside anyway. The bartender was very sweet.  While I perused the beer list, I kept squinting at the price thinking, "Is this for a pint? $7?" Compared to other venues who claim to have a diverse craft beer selection, these brews didn't resonate strongly with me. Settling for an API, I then chose the shrimp mac n cheese and a side of asparagus. Both were okay, but $11 for a tiny pot of mostly sauce and seriously overcooked noodles that fell apart at the touch of my fork? My husband really did not enjoy his burger which was sort of a mess, but the cheapest option amidst the entrees priced anywhere from $25-30. I started to get the feeling that we patrons are actually mini-tenants disguised as diners.   I understand that this remodel must have been expensive and the rent can't be cheap, but after paying $70 for 2 people, we did not walk away feeling even remotely satisfied. For the same price, you could have an exquisite meal at a gastropub in Old Town from a creative menu with stellar service (i.e. Citizen Public House style). For a much lower price, you could sit on an amazing patio and have decent food with a fun crowd (i.e. OHSO style). We won't risk another subprime experience at such an expense in the future.

It's taken me a few months to really assess my vote for Fit Republic - there is a lot to experience. From flow to hot yoga, HIIT to crossfit, barre to cycling, instructors with varying styles - I'm not one to make up my mind after one visit. I also won't claim to have loved every single class, but what stands out is how well the group fitness and gym experience are combined. I have a magnetically repelling reaction when it comes to conventional gyms, so the group class + locker room concept has a lot of appeal for me. I've also historically been noncommittal to one type of exercise, so the choice/variety factor at Fit Republic scores big points.  As to the actual classes offered, the variety and instructor experience is much better here than at a stereotypical gym. The instructors are thoughtful about their classes and well-trained in what they do. Every teacher/coach/instructor takes the time to introduce themselves to new comers and does a great job of be inclusive from the start. I myself mostly frequent hot vinyasa and crossfit. HIIT is fun, fast paced, and we'll say...humbling. If you think you're fit, this class will might make you question just how much. I've ultimately settled on crossfit as my main workout, because I love the class structure, team environment, and tangible results - whether it's physique or PR's.  The versatile schedule, well-maintained facility and affordable price really make the unlimited monthly membership worth it for me. They've done well to build a community rather than cater to cliques as many "studio" concepts tend to do. My one wish list item is that there be a solution around what really isn't an affordable drop-in fee for visitors that can't or have already taken advantage of the 5 day pass. We'd love to bring visitors here from out of town, especially as more people start to trickle in for the holidays. But at $25/class, it's a hard sell. Guest passes for 12-month contract members? Maybe some day! I'll drop that in the comment box on my way out next time.

The excitement to see a new Vig location THIS close to my house was nearly unbearable for the months of anticipation we had to bear before its opening. An interesting locale amidst a somewhat golf-centric, white-haired community, but I don't care how old you are if you like to party. This location is perhaps my least favorite of all 4 venues, but it is within biking distance and therefore still satisfactory by Vig standards.  The food is delicious and consistent with their other locations. The service at this particular shop is phenomenal. The bartenders are super cool as are the table servers. Service - good or bad - rarely makes or breaks my dining experience, but really good service stands out. The only major drawbacks are: 1) No corn hole/bacci ball....seriously? I didn't know it was possible to build a Vig without a signature bacci court, and I feel personally slighted by this oversight. 2) Acoustics in the bar area are terrible when the house is full. During happy hour on a busy night, it is 100% impossible to have a conversation that doesn't end in a hoarse throat. We've made the mistake (twice) of attempting a drink at 5pm on a Friday - just don't. It's crazy, packed, difficult to order and not worth the screaming match.  I still love you, Vig. And I will still come here lots and lots. Especially for half price bottles of wine on Sunday night!

As much as I would love to avoid hyperbolic syntax, this is THE best soft serve I've EVER had. I'm bummed we didn't join the loyalty program about 30 visits ago. We used to hit up a certain gelato...spot...(who shall remain nameless), but after hitting up some classic sweet, sweet soft serve, the cravings for this ice cream just don't stop when my sweet tooth strikes.   I love the adorable setup with the sidewalk window smooshed between 2 restaurants. My hubby and I love to take a stroll after dinner in Old Town and "end up" at Shakes n Cones (as if it just happened by chance) and then continue our stroll through the hood with ice cream in hand. Walking and consuming ice cream basically offset each other, right? That's what I'm telling my hips. The selections are quite simple - cone, cup or shake. Chocolate, vanilla or twist. Classic toppings/mix-ins, nothing complicated like you find in overstimulating fro-yo joints these days. Ready in a jiffy (or a little longer if there's a line). Sweet-as-can-be staff at a family-owned establishment. The fact that the ice cream is organic is a major plus. All the goodness lives here, all of it!  There is always room for ice cream. Wait, there is always room for THIS ice cream.

This is definitely my favorite place in Old Town to grab a cocktail and burrow for an evening of chatter with friends. While it may not be my favorite when it's super busy (i.e. post-10pm on a weekend) as drink times typically suffer quite a bit, it's almost always a perfect experience any other time. Food, beverages, atmosphere - the Beverly does them all well and consistently to boot.   We recently held a rather large party here last Saturday evening from about 7-9:30, and we were taken care of much better than I had anticipated for a group of our size. We were able to mix up bar with table service which helped, but our waitress was so on top of everything that it made for a completely seamless night. Outside of an event like this, I usually sit at the bar and their bartenders are always cool. The Ahi sliders and deviled eggs are my favorites, but I recently tried the mac n cheese which was amazing! The Brussel Sprouts weren't anything to write home about, a little greasy for my taste. I have historically loved the amazing cocktail list, but noticed it was pretty pared down on our last visit. That was somewhat disappointing, though our drinks were still very good.  The Beverly will definitely stay on the regular rotation, especially during the summer when tourists disappear and it's a little more manageable to enjoy such a cool *local* spot. But I hope all those amazing cocktails return! Or at least are available by special request :)

It had been an embarassingly long time since I had been to the dentist before taking a chance on Biltmore Dental Group. I didn't even like my dentist in MN before moving here but had to frequent the office quite a bit for some oral surgery in high school and college. That kind of killed the experience for me, so I neglected to find a dentist here.  Well I sucked it up and finally went. I'm so glad I found this place, and the fact that it's just over a half mile from my house is a plus. Everyone from the front desk to the dental hygenist, assistants and dentists are incredibly nice and friendly. They even remembered my on just my second visit.   So I guess the fact that I'm actually getting my teeth cleaned regularly is testament to my experience. The only reason I dropped the 4th star is because I'm still skeptical of all dentist offices and their drills.
