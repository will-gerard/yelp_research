Disgusting food, disgusting desserts.   It's all superficial here - everything looks good until you take a bite out of it. The pastas and noodles were overcooked and oversauced, the fried foods (you usually can't go wrong with those) were good until I bit into one that was all breading and oil, and the mac n' cheese didn't fail to disappoint.  The desserts were bitter or plain disgusting and the soft serve ice cream was icy and cheap tasting. The cookies, which looked really good - did not live up to their looks.  I do give Hometown Buffet two stars however, for their dinner rolls and mushrooms. THOSE, well... Those were pretty awesome.

It's your standard Red Robin.  Once again, I was with a large group of people (40 or so) and though we were first turned away from RR due to seating, they called us back to tell us that they had room for us. Kinda sorta nice.  The waiter for my table was impossibly nice and courteous (we definitely tipped well) and the food arrived pretty quickly. Again, standard RR. I had a salmon burger, and the only bad thing was that the salmon started to break apart half way through. Oh well.  It doesn't really deserve four stars, but it doesn't deserve three either. Ehh. 3.5, then.

I'm not one for motels, but this place makes me think otherwise. I stayed here for two nights with my dragon boat team for a race, and this place wasn't bad at all.  Small, it's true, and not that amazing on the inside, but it's clean, not smelly, and has everything you need for a short trip.   The bad: frolicking with a large group of Asian kids - yourself included - in the pool. Random old white men taking pictures of you and all that jazz from the third floor balcony... Staring, gawking...  I bet they're going to tell all of their friends that they went to China.  Anyways. Good place to stay!
