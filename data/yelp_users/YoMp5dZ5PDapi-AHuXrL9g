Absolutely love love love this place!!! The service here is awesome and the employees are VERY knowledgeable. Unlike when I go to petco or petsmart they give me a blank stare if you ask any question related to reptiles lol. It's a lil bit of a drive for us but worth every mile.  Our reptile family consists of a ball python, 2 bearded dragons and just recently added a sulcata!!! Can't wait to add more!!!

Had something shipped here a few weeks back the employee who took the info wrote a completely different address so our item was sent to the wrong location. I thought well I at least got insurance so if it's lost I can file a claim. Supposedly that's what we thought we did then after two weeks called to see what the claim status was and the person that looked into was saying we couldn't file a claim because we used ground shipping and that doesn't fall under their guaranteed shipping policy. At this point I'm very upset because of all the time wasted. The guy had the nerve to tell me I need to be patient and work with him.....really?!?! It's not like we shipped a 20-50 dollar item we shipped an item worth 700 dollars and I need to be patient?!?! Well thanks to whoever got a hold of our item because they did the good deed of shipping it to where it was suppose to go not because this store made an effort to fix the issue in a timely manner. They did refund us the shipping cost for the inconvenience which is the only reason they get 2 stars. Never again will I use the services of UPS for my shipping needs I will stick with fedex

My visit was a few weeks back and I forgot to write this review....went in to pick up my order and I only had a 100 dollar bill to pay the first employee told me they couldn't take such large bill but then James came and said he could brake it no problem. Also my order of wings never got done so he apologized and took them off my bill and got them done really quick. Great employee....happy he was able to help not sure what the outcome would have been if he wasn't

I have been coming here for about a year now. I do love the fact that they have a kids corner so my little one plays while we shop. I also do like that certain employees remember us and are very pleasant. There are however a few that probably could use some coaching with customer service. One cashier in particular I don't know her name but everytime I shop and I buy the usual bottle of wine I get asked for my ID before she even starts to ring anything up. I always have it ready because although I'm 27 I know I look young but the fact that she doesn't even start ringing up my items she is already asking for my ID. It's definitely not something I would consider to never shop there again but I just know who she is so I try to avoid her. Also they unfortunately don't carry the formula I have to buy so I'm forced to drive all the way to wal mart which is a bummer because I avoid wal mart as much as possible. Other than that I have no complains. The produce guys have been very helpful and the meat department are ALWAYS a pleasure.

I give this place 5 stars because I walked in during lunch hour hoping to get an easy to go order since I was in a hurry and although at first one of the waitresses said it was going to be a very long time she did go double check and the manager and a server came out and said they could do it in about 15 min. As I was standing there waiting I was definitely not ignored several servers passed by me and asked if I was being helped and the bartender even offered me something to drink while I wait. Kuddos to them for the effort and thank you for filling my order very quickly on such a busy hour.

If I could give this place more than 5 stars I definitely would the 5 stars just doesn't give this place justice......I'm VERY embarrassed to say but I came here ordering food and when I handed the gentleman Jon my card he told me it was declined. Me thinking how can it possibly have been declined I checked and unfortunately a recent reoccurring payment that wasn't suppose to go through when it did was showing up. They thankfully didn't start my whole order but only some of it. It wasn't for much and I left every other card at home because I didn't think anything of it. Well this gentleman took the change I had and gladly gave me what they already had prepared....again embarrassed because I had the money to pay but just didn't have it on me. I grabbed a credit card that I probably shouldn't have. Well he was AMAZING to cover what I was missing I insisted he didn't but he had no problem doing it....he even offered my whinning kids a drink. I'm not the type to take advantage of good people so I will be back to pay for the food I couldn't cover. This just couldn't go unoticed and I appreciate him very much!!!! Good people are still out there just don't forget them when they do a good deed ;)

A little goes a long way...went in here to drop off a package it wasn't taped up so the the nice gentleman said next time it needs to be taped shut otherwise it will be a dollar charge. I thought that was completely fair and couldn't thank him enough. I will from now on use this place for any of my shipping needs. It was just for a dollar but that just shows you the kind of business this place is and for him not to charge me my first time in was awesome

After a traumatic first hair cut for my 5 year old at another salon i did my research and decided to give this place a shot, since her hair is extremely curly thick I needed someone with experience. I must say I was definitley not dissapointed. Nikki did AMAZING!!! She knew exactly what to do with her and she even gave me a short lesson on what to do at home. She was very confident with my daughters hair and even had a great sense of humor that made my daughter feel comfortable with her. I personally dont have curly hair but it runs in my family and its really hard to find a hair place that really know what they are doing so I am highly recommending this place to anyone with curly hair.

I'm sorry but this place is a freaking joke. The only reason they have good reviews is because they push their customers to put a good review for them to get extra cash. My husband pawned my laptop and we only needed to do it for like 4 days. He gave me the slip so I can go get it. Well when I went to go get it out after the 4 days as promised they denied me. I had the slip and everything. The girl at the counter first off was eating hot cheetos licking her damn fingers after I gave her my slip. (Unprofessional) then she noticed it was my husband's name on the slip and said sorry but he needs to be the one here to get it out. I said to her that we are married and our last names are the same....her excuse was that she didn't know if we really were and she just couldn't.   At this point I'm pissed because not only do I have the pawn slip but I'm paying them for the amount requested with the finance charge.  I called my husband told him the situation and he said ask if they can call him on the number he left when he pawned it. I asked, and that little girl went and got another guy to come and ask me "how can I help you" really?!??! I'm sure your hot cheeto eating counter girl already told you.....anyways I told him...look...we need to get this laptop out and my husband said you can call him on the number he left as a contact number. He said sorry but unless you have a notarized letter from him there is nothing I can do.....I advised him that my husband would change his good review and all he said was....unfortunately that's out of my control.....we haven't had to pawn anything in 5 years!!! And for us to get this bad of an experience thank GOD we don't have to again and if we did believe me we will never do it again from here. The area in itself is scetchy so maybe I see why they are so quick to judge. The hot cheeto girl at the counter had the nerve to basically assume I'm lying when I told her the person who pawned my laptop is my husband, all she said was she didn't know if that is even true. I don't know what kind of people they deal with but honestly if your desperate for money just go somewhere else. If people find my review funny or non appreciated then please do yelp a favor and delete your yelp account or Google account for that matter.

I went in for a hair cut and i loved the way my haircut came out. I also was looking for an experienced hair stylist for my daughters hair because it is very spiral curled and it was her first haircut ever so her hair was also very long. She if 5 years old. I scheduled her for the next day since there wasnt a hair stylist available for her. The next day we came back turns out the hair stylist that we scheduled with just pretty much threw her to the side and had anyone else cut her hair. It happened to be my hairstylist from the previous day. She did a great job on my hair so i gave her the benefit of the doubt. My daughter sat in the chair for two hours getting her hair blow dryed before attempting to cut any hair. Of coarse she was getting tired and was crying and whinning and complaining at times i even admit a little over exaggerating. Well apparently what looked like the "owner" came over and rudely said to my husband and I that she needed to stop the torture for EVERYONE....i was appalled. The hair stylist immediately stopped blow drying her hair, i looked at her and said ok what are we gonna do now. She basically went to ask the owners permission to continue the haircut but she didnt even cut it the way we planned to. It ended up being a half- a** job. If your salon has an issue with cutting kids hair then dont allow your salon to schedule appointments for kids. For being an owner of a business you should treat ALL your paying customers with respect regardless of the situation had i known how poorly her customer service skills were i would have taken my money elsewhere. This salon is ANTI CHILDREN so dont even waste your time. P.S. found another salon a little bit more expensive for a kids haircut but AMAZING service....always true what they say you get what you pay for.

Sadly they have a usps service inside but don't bring your items here to ship if they aren't absolutely ready to go. I took a box in to ship out and I just needed to tape it shut and tape the shipping label to it and the guy said they don't do that. He told me I would have to buy my own tape. First off if you are a legitimate usps service you shouldn't charge your customers for tape. I told him I wasn't buying tape and I was just going to the actual post office and all he said was ok. Funny thing was that I came here to ship items before and the girl that helped me boxed them up and taped them. Hmm guess it depends who you get.

I give them 2 stars because I've bought things here with pretty decent prices. However the lack of customer service makes it feel really unpleasant to even be in there. I try to hurry in and hurry out. The times I have taken in items they don't really select much because they say they have to much of certain things but never have it in the sizes I'm looking for. They really don't give a lot either for items they buy. I was doing it because I have a growing baby and I thought I could buy here and re sale when I needed bigger sizes but truth is they won't even take back stuff they sold to you to begin with. I don't think this company really works to convenience you more like they just care about making money.

It's hard to find a Chinese restaurant that cooks the fried rice to my liking and this one topped the charts. I also ordered orange chicken and it was hands down the best orange chicken I have ever had!!!! Definitely recommend this place, can't wait till they start delivering might order more often

Finally tried this place and I must say the burritos were delicious....I am simple when it comes to burritos and prefer not a lot of toppings so this place is perfect for me!!! It is more of a grab and go place since not a lot of room but hopefully with such good business they have they decide to move to a bigger location. Highly recommend to anyone
