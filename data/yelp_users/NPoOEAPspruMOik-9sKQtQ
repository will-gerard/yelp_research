They should change the name of their water park from Oasis to Shit Creek. Or The Poop Deck. Or maybe Poo-nami. We stayed there last night and the water slides and lazy river were closed yesterday afternoon and again this morning. This same thing occurred when we stayed at the resort in July, 2009. I asked the employee at the entrance/exit if this was a common occurrence and she said, basically, yes. Today it was a "Code 2" which means poop in the pool. I complained that parents need to put their kids in swim diapers and she said that it was an ADULT that pooped in the pool the day before. AN ADULT! Disgusting.

Jake's been taking care of our cars for almost 7 years. He's very trustworthy and fair.

My friend has raved about this place for months, so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO. It was amazing! Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA., but around 400 miles closer. I also love the little grocery store. Very cute things to buy.

I've been using this jeweler for years, and he's great. I started going when my friend recommended him to me. He's been very accommodating and honest over the years.

Do not go to this car wash. I dropped my kids off at choir and thought I'd run in for a quick car wash. Oh no! They locked my keys in the car. I couldn't get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldn't get a signal. Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence. They didn't even comp the car wash!  If you go here, don't pay for your car wash until your car is done!

I've been a patient for years. Dr Huston is very good. Practice is well run and they don't bother you with all the shenanigans you find at some other places.

Delicious. My friend took me and I loved it. I had the albacore tuna and fruit cup.

Beautiful outdoor patio, shaded from the sun. Went here with 20 friends from work, and we had a great time. Ordered pizza and wedge salad. Both were DELISH. Servers were very attentive.
