Meatballs to die for! Granted I've only eaten here once, but I tasted quite a few items and all were top notch! Can't wait to come back here for a 2nd time.

This place is so overrated!!  I'm concerned that some are actually delusional enough to consume this food. Friends of mine raved about how delicious everything on this menu was, so I walked in with such high hopes, only to be compeltey let down. All was bland and needed salt, and flavor all together. If I could give a half star, I would.

Do yourself a favor and try the Rico burro.  Add a little bit of sour cream.....so delicious! Best Mexican food in town!

We decided to stop here after checking out the Grand Ave festival. We ordered the Carne asada taco plate long with the Loco elote.  The meat was tender and flaoverful, only.lacking some salt. Beans and rice were just okay. The corn was tasty and to the point.  All in all this place is worth trying if you're in the area.  I wouldn't  take a special trip out here just for the food.  Friendly staff is why I opted to give 4 stars instead of 3!
