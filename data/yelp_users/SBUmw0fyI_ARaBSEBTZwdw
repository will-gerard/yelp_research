We have been using Dugan Plumbing for all of our Plumbing needs at our Property Management company.  Geoff and his team are responsive, honest and do good work.   I highly recommend them to anyone.

Scott and his team are great!   We use them often for our clients who are looking for thorough and knowledgable home inspection services!   He is honest and very professional which is very important for Real Estate agents and home buyers looking for a home inspector!  I would highly recommend him to my clients and do!

So rude.   The girl at the front was literally rolling her eyes at me when I said what I had done before with my acrylics.   Truth be told they probably didn't understand our hasn't tried it before but being rude to a customer was unnecessary.

Great environment for kids.  Having owned a child care center in the past I can tell a well run school when I see  one.   Friendly staff,  clean rooms. Attentive teachers and staff.   Very nice place to leave my baby when going to work.    Would recommend to anyone.    My 2:year old has been going for several months now and loves it!

We had been using this company for quite a few jobs.  They had appointments to do jobs and the day of 2 jobs, they didn't complete them.  And said they wouldn't.  The service they did at a recent job a few weeks prior was horrendous, and I asked that in the future they tell us that they can't get the carpet cleaned rather then just do it and leave the carpet in unlivable condition.  It cost us money and then had to replace the carpet anyway.   No loyalty, no service.  The poor girl that answers the phone was shocked as well.   I have never seen a carpet company respond like this.

Love the wings, sandwiches and pizza.  Good family environment.    Love the garlic rotoli's and can't go wrong with the specialty drinks.    Blueberry smash tonight is hitting the spot!
