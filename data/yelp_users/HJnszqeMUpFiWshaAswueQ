Lately, I can't seem to get enough of South Asia in my belly. I have my Valley favorites (India Gate in Chandler and The Dhaba in Tempe), but I wanted to give a new joint a go. So I decided to try the rather palatial-looking India Delhi Palace in East Phoenix because I had heard good things about its lunch buffet.  Luckily, my foodie friends aren't liars.   I arrived shortly before the lunch rush. I was greeted promptly and politely. I then asked if the buffet had a large selection of vegetarian options, and he actually gave me a brief but thorough tour of the veggie offerings, which, much to my delight, comprised much of the buffet. I promptly filled my plate with aloo matar and daal maharani. But don't worry, omnivores; there were plenty of delicious-looking meat dishes on the slate as well.   The food was very tasty, but what makes this place stand up above other Indian buffets was the exceptional, attentive service. A team of servers worked to make sure I received fresh naan with my meal, my water glass was always filled and any questions I had were answered. I don't expect much in the way of help when it comes to buffets, so this was a pleasant surprise.   I will definitely be back one of these days to try something from the menu (bengan bhartha, I'm looking at you).

Love this place! I love it so much that I'm very surprised at the tepid reviews. A cozy Vietnamese deli with warm, fast and efficient counter service, this is exactly the kind of eatery I regularly seek out.   I tried the vegetable sandwich and the Vietnamese coffee. The sandwich, served on French bread, was topped with fresh veggies, including shredded carrots, cilantro and mint, and a sweet aioli spread. It was flavorful, fresh and filling. The coffee, mixed with condensed milk, was sweet, but not too sweet -- just the way I like it.  My only complaint: it's a bit on the high side for this type of fare. My meal came to $10; at Lee's, the tab would have been $7 tops. But this a nicer place than Lee's, where the service and atmosphere leave something to be desired.  I will be back. This place is a new favorite.

I've always been a big fan of Indian food, but as a newbie to the Valley, I wasn't quite sure where to get my vegetable korma fix. I mentioned this in passing to one of my coworkers, and he emphatically suggested India Gate, saying it was the best Indian food he has had in Valley, even after conducting a lengthy but informal taste test of the Valley's other Indian offerings. He then warned me that it would look like a hole-in-the-wall, with a secluded location within a Chandler shopping center.    So, when I had a particularly powerful hankering for Indian food one night, I decided to make the trip from north Tempe to west Chandler to check out this place once and for all.  And I wasn't disappointed. This is, indeed, a gem of a restaurant.  I decided on the bhindi masala, which is okra cooked with onions, tomatoes and spices. I am a big fan of okra, which, sadly, doesn't seem to make it onto many restaurant menus. My dish was incredibly flavorful and one of the most memorable of the year. I have since returned to try India Gate's malai kofta (vegetable dumplings in an incredible cheese sauce,  vegetable korma,  veggie fried rice, bengan bharta and samosas. Everything has proved to be delicious.  However, the restaurant is not without its drawbacks. The service I've received has been awkward at best, if not a touch rude. Also, many on the serving staff speak with thick Indian accents that I found hard to understand. Once, I even received the garlic naan instead of the plain naan because I couldn't understand my waiter when he was repeating my order back to me. For some, I realize that would be a pretty cool mistake, but garlic gives me heartburn surely invented by El Diablo himself. I would go here even more often if it weren't for the communication barrier.  Like my coworker, I highly recommend this place as one of the Valley's tastiest., even when considering the less than desirable service I've received there. It's a particularly great place for take-out; there's even a coupon for 15 percent off take-out orders on its website.

Green is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in the Valley. The ingenuity of offering comfort vegan food is matched by its excellent and delicious execution of the concept. Here you can find inventive takes on veghead staples such as salads and Thai-inspired noodle dishes to daring vegan versions of chili fries and hot wings (made from mushroom stems) that prove worthy rivals to the animal-involved originals. The bistro features a varied menu, bolstered by specials that change daily. Green also features a handful of prepackaged vegan specialty foods, including gelatin-free marshmallows.  Perhaps what I like best about Green is its hip, progressive vibe that has not fallen victim to the snotty hipster nonsense so prevalent in The Valley's "cool" restaurants. On the contrary, the staff at Green is always helpful and friendly.

Here's something I never expected to say since becoming a vegetarian: I can't get enough of Fatburger. My boyfriend, who is also a veghead, and I actively avoided this place until we found out last week that it serves a veggie burger. So, we put aside our judgment  and decided to try out the joint. And I'm so, so glad we did.   The veggie burger is made with a premium Boca patty that is thick, juicy and flavorful. Fatburger also features a variety of toppings and customizing items is pretty easy. This is important because I don't like when restaurants have rigid topping standards for their sandwiches (I'm looking at you, Burger King).  I suppose my only complaints are the long wait time and high prices for what I consider a fast food joint. But the food is notches above your typical drive-thru eatery, and the wait is worth it.

My husband and I were recently looking for flooring, so we went to ProSource for samples. We were quite impressed with the selection, as well as the friendly, knowledgeable service we received. We talked extensively with Vickie, who was quite helpful in helping us make a selection. We highly recommend ProSource as a flooring supplier.

Until recently, my husband and I came here on a weekly basis. Stingray offers a great happy hour and very decent sushi and drinks in a stylish restaurant within a mile of our apartment. But, we get mediocre to poor service about 70 percent of the time we go there. After an exceptionally bad and slow experience, my husband and I decided to look elsewhere to give regular business. I get the feeling we won't be missed. So long, Stingray.
