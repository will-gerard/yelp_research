Long lines before/after sporting events. Limited beer selection. Mediocre food. I wasn't impressed. I can't tell you how many times I thought it would be a good idea to stop in for a drink or snack while in the area, only to find out that a baseball or basketball game was scheduled down the street and the wait would be an hour or longer. Not worth the wait.

Worth driving through the barrio to get to. Their green chili burrito was very good. The dinning area is as sparse as it gets. White walls and basic chairs and tables. You don't go here for ambiance, you go for the food. You order from the counter and wait for your number to be called. Quite good.

Great taco shop!! Must get the tacos! Been back a few times and haven't found anything that I wouldn't order again. Great food, fair prices.

I go here for their chips and dips. Their green chili dip is out of this world amazing. I would order it by the gallon if I could. The taco salad is good, and comes with sour cream and guac, without being an additional charge. The enchiladas and flauta plates meet expectations. They serve a number of new mexican style hatch green chili plates. A favorite of mine. Avoid on Friday and Saturday nights, the line and wait is just ridiculous. It's not the best mexican restaurant I have ever been to, but few restaurants in the area have a variety of green chili dishes, let alone good ones. So for this, I give them 5 stars.

I can't say anything that hasn't been said already. Love this place. Personal favorites 8th street ale, and all of their IPA's. Chicken strips and nachos are some favorite menu items. Their dinner specials are always unique and are typically very good (even if they are occasionally overpriced for bar food). Best bar in town for hanging out with friends and downing a pint.

Was a regular here. Used to visit once a week. Now after two visits in a row of them 'losing' my order, I am considering going elsewhere. At the time I didn't have time to wait for a remake. They offered me brownies and chips as consolation. That just didn't reverse my frustration.   The sign on the wall says something like "quality takes time, it will be a miracle if you get your sandwich in less than 5 minutes". This is acurate. The sandwiches are good. Some unique combinations, combined with great herb garlic bread makes the sandwiches nearly worth the 8 bucks you are going to shell out. However, a Jimmy Johns opened a mile or two down the street. I get my food in 1 minute and haven't had an order "lost".   I would have given them 4 stars prior to the last two visits, but the continuous loss of my confidence and over priced food brings it down to a two. It will be some time before I make it back to cheba.

Good pizza, great steak sandwich, reasonable prices. Big pet peeve, charging for soda refills. Free refills are expected, and the norm at restaurants with soda fountains. Pisses me off when restaurants post the "$.50 for refill" sign on the fountain. Otherwise, they have limited seating, food is ordered at the counter, and their hours seem somewhat limited.

Very good! They offer 32 ounce draft beers, $1 off during happy hour, most are around 8 bucks. The pastys are awesome. Had the cajun chicken with ham, bacon, swiss, and chipotle sauce, it was great. The pesto chicken with mozzarella, mushrooms, and artichokes, with marinara on the side was solid as well. Will return again. Small seating area, groups of 4 would be the max I would recommend without split seating.

I can't believe I made it through ASU without discovering this gem of a restaurant. This place is amazing. Aside from not accepting plastic forms of payment (the only drawback), this place is now on my lunch rotation. On the first trip I tried the BBQ chicken and the crunchy chicken, both very good. Can't wait to go back for more. It has very limited seating so plan on taking your food to go or avoid the lunch time rush.

I am a fan of University Animal Hospital. I have taken my dog there a few times and have felt like she was getting top notch care. I don't know if their prices are reasonable or not, but I have been more than satisfied with their level of care.   My dog was sneaky and nosey enough to get into a bottle of medication in the house. I called UAH, they fit me in immediately and were up front, and clear about my options and cost. They helped me make an informed decision about the care I could afford. They spent a lot of time talking through our options and explaining the different treatments available. I never felt rushed. They even found a few ways to cut down on the cost of the treatment. I was very happy with the service. My puppy is healthy as ever, and that is in no small part due to the car at UAH.  The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because on a number of visits one of the ladies working the front desk was downright not friendly. Don't get me wrong, out of the 6 people working up front, she was the only one that didn't seem to care about her customer interactions. Everyone else was great, but she left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Yet I wouldn't hesitate to return. I would trust my dog with them everyday of the week.

The owner, and chef came out and talked about the menu. Sat with us for a few minutes after the meal to chat and see how we liked it. Very personable guy. Don't be thrown off by the deli style setting and informal dinning areas, the food is good, and the service is even better. It looked like some of the food was prepared earlier and set in the refrigerated display case. It didn't affect taste at all, it did help speed the prep time. Ultimately I would go back again. I was pleasantly surprised.

After my washer broke, and completely flooded my garage, I needed a repair company. I tried setting up an appointment through the manufacurer, but couldn't get an honest answer about price.I  was skeptical when searching for appliance repair companies locally as well. Reading google and yelp reviews was the only way to pre-screen the companies I was condsidering. Based on the good reviews on Yelp for Dino's, I decided to give them a try. They showed up exactly when they said they would. The tech was friendly, and knew what he was doing. He fixed the issue in a matter of minutes, and was on his way. He even showed me how to correct the problem if it happened again. I am 100% satisfied with the service and would call them again for any of my home appliance needs.

Good food! Have been searching for a reasonable Mexican restaurant in tempe for a while now. The first time I drove by I didn't stop because it didn't look like a sit down restaurant. After reading some yelp reviews I decides to give it a go. I am glad I did. It was priced very fairly. Their specials are awesomely priced, and very tastey.  Great rolled tacos with rice and beans. Pretty good salsa too. Little upset at the lack of free chips/salsa, but overall a dinner for two and chips was under $20. I'll take that any day of the week. I plan to return soon.

Quick service, reasonable prices, and great tacos. The three taco combo was great. I'd much rather visit this locally owned establishment than other chains. Good food, give it a try!

Absolutely loved it. Heard about lo-lo's from friends and decided to try it with my family. Had to wait an hour for a table for 7 on a sunday afternoon. I never wait that long for seating, but their reputation meant I was willing to wait it out. I am glad we did! Kool-aid was sugary and delicious. The "Stupid fries" were stupid good. Fried chicken was some of the best I had ever had. Combined with the great mac and cheese, and waffles it was a great meal. The waffles alone weren't amazing, but they were good, and the meal as a whole was very good. I would recommend avoiding large groups during peak rushes, due to limited space, there aren't many seating options for groups. Groups of 4 or less were able to be seated much faster. I will be going back again soon.

After a second visit, the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor. Quite a contrast to my first visit. Still enjoyed the meal, but wasn't as impressed with the chicken. I'll have to go back to see if it was a fluke.

Average sandwich place. Sub-par service. Why on earth would someone want to talk to a rude employee only to then wait 10 minutes for a sandwich. If you ask me there are far better options in town.

Great happy hour deals. $4.50 for a giant, nearly pitcher sized beer, solid appetizers, and good food. Lots of TV's, and a pool table or two. The only issue we had was the lack of table seating. For such a large building it seemed like there weren't that many tables. The bar takes up half of the floor space.

Stopped in for lunch. Had the dark mole shrimp tacos. Delicious, with a great salsa bar. I like the atmosphere of a small place with good tacos.

Disappointed is my one word attitude after visiting this pub. Out of four meals only one met expectations. The eggs were so undercooked the whites were more runny than the yokes. The red meats were cooked opposite our request. The "rare" steak was overcooked and tough as leather. The "medium" steak sandwich was still mooing. The server was awesome, but with completely disappointing food, and service alone does not make me want to return, and I won't. There are countless pubs in the area that I would pick over this one. They spent a lot of money on the decor, and none of it creating safe and appetizing food.

It took a few visits to find the ramen I liked best, but they are all good. Very sizable portions, and quick service. Employees are very friendly and I enjoy making regular trips.

I was looking for a new place to grab some food and was scrolling down the New Times "Best of List" and saw Maui Dog. I was instantly reminded of a visit to Kauai and the amazing Pukka Dog establishment. I checked their menu online and was sold.   The building is quaint and reminiscent of a hot dog shack in Hawaii. There is indoor and outdoor seating. A small TV and Wifi. The Hana dog was amazing: avocado, bacon, pico de gallo, cilantro, and added maui mustard. I can't wait to go back. Loved the fruit infused mustard and other tropical toppings.   The owner was the cashier and after we finished eating he sat down and chatted with us for a bit. It was our first time dining there, and he welcomed us, and we talked about Pukka dog and his inspiration for his island dogs. Very friendly and welcoming, and it added that extra element that is missing in so many restaurants.   All together it was a solid meal, reasonable prices, and awesome staff. 5 stars all the way. I can't wait to go back and try another dog.

I have visited twice. I loved it the first time. Second time was a disaster. Lunch time on a weekend, the place was slammed inside, but had plenty of space on the patio. After 45 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. I stopped the bus boy 3 times and asked for them to mention to the server we were ready to order drinks and food. I stopped two other servers who said we weren't in their area, and they would get the person who's zone we were in. She appeared once or twice, quickly running to other tables, while ignoring ours. I can't say I am interested in returning after wasting a trip. There appeared to be some sort of event that that bar was aware of, that they completely failed to adequately staff for (a mid day pub crawl type of thing). I watched a couple of other groups walk out as well. They lost a lot of business that day.
