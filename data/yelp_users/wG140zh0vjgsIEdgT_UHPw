My company utilizes Nibblers for corporate events.  They are definitely an office favorite, and are a pleasure to work with.  The food is always tasty and affordable, the delivery is always prompt, and the staff is always extremely helpful & courteous.  Today's St. Patrick's Day special was delicious!  Thanks, Nibblers!!

I tried Hillstone for the first time about 2 years ago, and I don't remember it being anything review-worthy.  I have dined 3 times in the past 2 months... I am a fan!  Making a reservation might be a smart choice, there was a 30 minute wait on a Tuesday evening.  (Good for them!)  Try the sushi!  You'll be pleasantly surprised!

Would absolutely recommend this dealership.  The service department is prompt, extremely knowledgeable and HONEST!  They actually talked me out of getting my brakes serviced, which, in my experience, is a rarity for any auto shop.  Chris Scherff in the sales department is a breeze to work with.  Will definitely be a repeat customer.

Unfortunately, the service department has taken a turn for the worst.  I rated this dealership 5 stars when I purchased my car.  You can see in my previous review, my former service advisor was prompt, helpful & honest.  He has since retired and apparently I was assigned George Gilbert as punishment.  Driving my car home one evening, the power steering on my CTS completely went out.  It was late, and I was close to home, so I drove home and parked it.  I had trusted this dealership with my car for service since purchase, so I planned to have it towed to Coulter in the morning.  When I got in the car the next morning, everything was fine.  Power steering intact, car seemed fine.  I called Coulter, made an appointment and drove my car down myself.  The next day, I was given a verbal repair quote of $4,800 to replace the rack & pinion unit, two motor mounts, and repair the steering gear & pump.  Without turning this into a novel, I was completely shocked by the amount, so I took the car to a family friend for a 2nd opinion.  He could not find anything wrong with the car.  Motor mounts were intact, steering pump had not "exploded" like George dramatically explained on the phone, and the rack & pinion unit did not need replacement.  I let the mechanic keep the car an extra day with the instructions to "drive it like he stole it" to see if he could get the power steering error message to show.  Meanwhile, I requested a written estimate from George over the phone.  He said he would email it to me.  One day went by... no email.  I emailed George and left a voicemail requesting the estimate again.  The next day, he emailed me a receipt for the cabin air filter I had replaced while they had my car.  Thanks, had that already.  I replied to his email requesting a specific written estimate for the $4,800 in repairs he had quoted me.  No response.  I requested the estimate again.  Three days later, he replied to me, "HAVE THEM TALK TO MARC TURNER ON THE DENT."  Not really sure what that even meant or had to do with anything I requested.  I got my car back from my mechanic, no repairs were needed.  My mechanic said there are some rumors circling about false motor mount replacements needed just to increase the revenue for the service department.  George still hasn't returned my email...

Casual atmosphere, upscale food.  Family-owned, with fresh, local ingredients.  Super friendly staff, remembers you after your first visit & will keep you coming back.  Fantastic happy hour specials, daily & weekly deals posted on their website.  The chef will make special accommodations for dietary concerns, or just a special request.  Great local spot!  Open for lunch, too!

Took another Yelper's advice & tried out Tuck Shop for date night. Absolutely LOVED it! Super trendy, very intimate spot with a unique menu. We shared each dish & still had leftovers to bring home! Definitely recommend making a reservation, seating is very limited.   We started with the Zucchini Planks. (I love anything zucchini!!) They were lightly breaded, flash fried to perfection with a lemon dipping aioli that was fantastic. We shared the Baby Lettuce Salad (sounds boring, but that goddess dressing - yum!!) For our entr√©e, we split the Chicken & Waffles with a small plate of Mac & Cheese. We were totally impressed with the meal. Three HUGE pieces of chicken that were golden fried served with fluffy waffle quarters & string beans. Definitely enough to share. And the Mac & Cheese? Topped with bacon & filled with gooey cheese sauce, it was heavenly.   Prices were on point, the whole meal with drinks for the two of us was under $55. We will definitely be back again... With the daily specials I can't wait to try what's next!

I've been a dedicated client of DermaHealth for almost 5 years & I won't trust anyone else with my skincare needs. I have never had a bad experience or been dissatisfied. The staff is always friendly, knowledgable, the facilities are super clean, and the service is always prompt. I've had girlfriends find Groupons elsewhere & ended up regretting it. Sign up for the Brilliant Distinctions program... It's like frequent flyer miles for Botox!

Hidden behind cement walls is a gem!  Speedy, courteous service tops off excellent menu choices.  The dark, candlelit atmosphere is perfect for a date night.   I'm a sucker for prosciutto, so I chose the pecorino tagliatelle.  It was excellent!   I will definitely be back!

Their selection of glitter gel polish is more than I've seen anywhere.  The gel pedicure lasts for 3 weeks, at least.  The staff is always courteous & helpful.  Have a glass of complimentary wine, relax & enjoy the music!

Best dental experience of my life to date.  A recent change in insurance providers at work left me searching for a new dentist.  Posh Dental was an amazing find!  Thanks, Yelp!  The staff was so kind & nurturing.  They provided a soothing paraffin wax treatment while I had my cleaning, such a fancy touch!  So happy with my new dentist!

Turned to Yelp for help on Super Bowl Sunday when the restaurant we went to was unexpectedly closed.  What a great accident!  Service was great, sushi was so fresh.  And they had a big screen TV with the game on, so the boyfriend was happy!  LOVED the squid salad.  Great variety for a very good price.  Will definitely be back!

My coworkers & I frequent this spot for lunch, they have really great lunch specials! Their bento boxes are only $11 & the super generous portions could easily be shared with a friend.   Last week we had a little "incident" with something ending up on the plate that shouldn't have been there. The manager's reaction absolutely blew me away. Most restaurants will give you an insincere "I'm sorry," but she went above & beyond to correct the mistake. Customer service at its finest!   The 4 star rating is only because of the slowness of the waitstaff. Lunch for most professionals is on a time schedule, and the waitstaff needs to accommodate that & pick up the pace!

Made the 45 minute haul down to Maricopa for a nice steak dinner with family that was in from out of town, one of which has visited this restaurant at least 10 times, and was praising the food the entire drive down.  I hadn't eaten anything all day & I was excited!    I immediately ordered a shrimp cocktail to accompany my whiskey cocktail.  The server couldn't comprehend this, he had to serve our drinks first and then come back to confirm I really wanted a shrimp cocktail as my appetizer.  For what is supposed to be an upscale steak house, the "jumbo" shrimp were embarrassing.  I'm pretty sure they came from the buffet next door.    We ordered the $99 steak for two, a 32 oz porterhouse cooked medium rare.  The steak comes with two sides, we chose mac & cheese, and mushrooms.  It also comes with soup or salad, we had one of each.  The salad was average, boyfriend enjoyed the soup.  The steak was extremely overcooked... it was late & by this time I was too tired to send it back and wait for another 32 ounces to be cooked properly.  The server seemed extremely overwhelmed, but the restaurant wasn't busy enough to justify that.    One of our guests had the lamb chops, they were cooked perfectly & absolutely delicious.  At $39, they were probably the smartest choice. The best part of my meal was the complimentary bread.   I'll be returning soon for an event at the casino, hopefully it's better the 2nd time around.

Stumbled on this place after taking the wrong exit off the 101.  The carne asada is amazing & the pricing is extremely fair.  Two tacos (full size, not street size), chips & salsa, and a beer for under $10!  I'll be frequenting here often.

I became an instant regular after my first visit.  20+ local & craft beers on tap, and some of the best pho I've ever had.  Has 2 huge TVs at the bar... I know where I'll be come football season!

I've been Anh's client for about 7 years now, and I wouldn't trust my nails to anyone else.  She & Chad are extremely knowledgable about nail trends, safety, and provide the utmost in customer care.  Walk-ins are welcomed, however, they are rare because they are usually booked with long-term standing clients.  Both Anh & Chad are so hospitable, I would recommend calling ahead to make an appointment so you can have their undivided attention.  As a self-proclaimed nail addict, I suggest the gel nails!  They're worth every penny!  Just ask, she'll tell you all about why they're better than acrylics.

HUGE fan of the Scottsdale location, came to check this one out since the wait on Sundays in Old Town is pretty long. (Obvi. The food is great.) I'm writing this review on my phone while we continue to wait for the check. Our waitress went missing a while ago... Not that she was around much to begin with. This was after the hostess forgot about us, even though we were in plain sight the whole time. Food is still good, same offerings as the Scottsdale location. I'd suffer the wait at Old Town for better service. Well... That's my review! Still no sign of the waitress or check.....

Can't believe they've been around since 2012 & I just found out about them!  Best service ever.  Minimal delivery time, prices are fair.  They carry anything you might need in a pinch.  Cigarettes, beer, condoms, toilet paper, feminine products.  OH - And yummy munchie food and pizza.  Delivery until 3AM on weekdays & 4AM on weekends.  I'm hooked!

I've only watched Hell's Kitchen a few times, but I'm pretty sure Gordon Ramsay would lose his mind & fire all the employees if he ever visited this location.  But then again, he's probably kicking back somewhere in South London drinking a pint collecting the royalties off this mess.  The staff was terrible, it took 15 minutes to get water I had asked for 3 times.  The shrimp cocktail was good, but it's Las Vegas & a shrimp cocktail.  The whole town pretty much has this dish nailed.  I'd suggest trying one of the other 647480 restaurants within walking distance.

All I can say is WOW. I haven't been this impressed by a restaurant in a long time. The menu is small, but quality makes up for quantity. We started with the ceviche, which was excellent. Fresh, tangy and on point. I had the short rib tacos & I'm still dreaming about them two weeks later. My date had the pork chop mol√© with house rice. Don't let the house rice scare you... chorizo & pineapple are a surprisingly tasty combination. OH - and they have a full bar! Appetizer, entr√©es & 3 beers was under $40. Mind = blown. Can't wait to go back!

Definitely one of the best places I've been in Vegas.  Super cool hidden spot.  TONS of craft beer on tap, and a handful of very impressive signature Bloody Mary's.  The Derby Breakfast Club Bloody Mary came with bacon and a pickled egg.  Took the edge off the hangover from the night before.  The decor is... interesting.  Very hipster.  My favorite was the horse painting on the patio.  Check it out!

New hotel, great service.  The rooms are nicely decorated, everything was new & clean.  The bed was SUPER comfortable.  One of the best I've ever slept on.  The Picnic pool area is on the 3rd floor, super sunny and catches a nice breeze to keep you cool.  Awesome cabanas with great live music.  Great room rates, and a nice change from staying on the strip.      They provide an in-room menu for the pizza place across the street, but they won't deliver at 3AM.  Or 4AM.  Trust me, I tried.  Also, the hotel front desk doesn't want to hear about how they won't deliver at 3AM or 4AM, respectfully.

Tried Door Dash for the first time with Turkdish.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed.  It was a little overpriced in general, and the portions were small.  The hummus came with one piece of pita bread.  I ordered an extra just in case & we still didn't have enough.  Probably will not try again.

All the same menu offerings as their Tempe and Scottsdale locations, with one big difference -- they serve beer!!  (and wine!) They offer a few different beers on tap, including some local breweries, and some bottle selections as well.

Such a pleasant surprise!  Looked on Yelp for a sushi bar in the area, and tried DOZO. Their extensive menu was so impressive!  They have so many rare fish you don't normally see on the menu.  Service was excellent!  I will definitely be back!

Had THE best experience with Bulwark! We were having issues with several bugs... Ants, roaches, and some mystery creepy crawlies! The employee when we called was extremely helpful & knew her stuff! She was able to get a tech dispatched the next day. James was very professional & knowledgeable when he came to the house. Will definitely recommend them to friends & family!

Was looking on Yelp for a sushi restaurant in my not usual neighborhood & saw a friend gave this a 5 star so I had to try it.  She was right!!  Worth more than a 5 star!!  Sushi selection was SO good, service was excellent!!  Casual, relaxed atmosphere.  She didn't say, but I'm pretty sure it was the owner who came out to check on us.  Very kind & welcoming.  Spicy edamame is the best in town according to the boyfriend... and he's an expert!  Can't wait to go back!!

I would say it's Chipotle on wheels, but I don't want to compare this AMAZING food truck to a restaurant that's associated with risks of food safety.  Wandering Donkey catered a wedding I attended last weekend & I was thoroughly impressed!  They handled the rush of the crowd with ease, the selections were amazing and SO tasty!  I chose the steak bowl with rice, black beans, and all the savory toppings.  Such a fun alternative to a traditional caterer!

Great delivery option from a local small business instead of your normal national pizza franchise chain. The chicken parmesan & the eggplant parmesan are always fantastic! Minestrone soup & a house salad add to the meal nicely.

Easily becoming our favorite work lunch spot! The menu is simple, but each choice is equally delicious. My fave is the Raspberry Chipotle Chicken Nachos. Each item is custom made to order, and the toppings are always fresh. The tables & restrooms are always clean, and the staff is super friendly. It's popular for a reason, so don't be surprised if there is a line. But the staff moves quickly & you'll be enjoying your meal before you even notice the wait in line!
