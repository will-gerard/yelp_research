This was the worst Panda Express I've ever had ! My sister warned me not to go here but me being the fat ass that I am, decided to go anyways. The fried rice wa clearly old or burned and the white rice was too clumpy to eat. They continue to mix old food with old food and had no fresh meat besides the orange chicken. And to top it off I PAID 8 dollars! Thumbs down, panda.

Overall, I get a great experience at any Dutch Bros in the valley. However, I come to this one every other day and I am always greeted on a first named basis and every single employee is friendly. EVERY SINGLE ONE. I love them all !

BEST PIZZA IN TEMPE ARIZONA!!!!! I have known the owner for about 3 years and they by far have the best pizza in the east valley. I'm from New Jersey, so I know good pizza. One slice of pizza equals a quarter of a whole pizza. and for UNDER 5 DOLLARS !!!!
