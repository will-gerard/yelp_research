Nothing too fancy or exciting. I ordered a torta and wasn't impressed the only positive was the chips and salsa other than that I would stay away.

I go to North Central Ave and Thomas and they have a great breakfast burrito.  I also like the freshness of the food and you can tell they use quality ingredients which comes out in the quality

Nothing too fancy as far as food. I share the shrimp fajatas not a bad portion but no flavor. I've had the burritos which are much better.

If you live in Surprise you know that there are not many good dining options.  Well this unique French place is top-notch, we have desert and the blueberry bread pudding was out of this world.  Will try entree's soon but great start

Yes I'm a fan. This is a hidden gem at the Palm's resort  Very laid back lounge/restaurant great California menu with sushi, steaks, salads and fish. Sushi was top notch. I ordered the ahi tuna for dinner which was just average but again the sushi was great!

yes big fan of Sam Fox and the Fox Restaurant brand.  Another truely unique concept and idea.  I don't care much for the overall decor but it's connect to the best mall in Arizona so the location is key.  I had the Kobe burger which was great enjoy.  Great service!

Great modern Mex food with a flare, flaming coffee was a great show and the tequila list is huge the table side guac is a must.

Another Sam Fox unique concept. Took some colleagues for lunch had the turkey pastrami on a pretzel bun tasted excellent. Great place for a lunch meeting in Downtown! @debbieporterfrc
