It's not everyday that the food looks better in person than it does in the picture. The staff was super friendly and attentive and the food was incredible. This place is a hidden gem and I will definitely return!!

Great service and great coffee! Went there at 7am and my party was the only one there but the staff was very attentive and friendly.

I can't really say much about this place. My friends and I sat down and weren't greeted for about 5 minutes. The food on the menu looked pretty good but I wouldn't know because we left due to the lack of service.

Greatest drink specials in all of central Scottsdale. All hail the Asian/Chuy's/San Felipe's/dive bar king!!!
