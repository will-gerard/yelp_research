01/31- Visited the community on a couple occasions and it appears to be modern and upscale.The community has state of the art equipment in the gym and has an amazing and colorful vibrant theme throughout the community. Definite place to consider when thinking about your next home!  05/25- After living here for 4 months I have come to find that my initial review was way off. Upon touring the community I was told my guests could park in unreserved spaces in the garage; after move in I was informed that all guests and visitors must park on the street or for an additional $45/month (roughly) we can get an unreserved space. Told that it's a standard in Scottsdale although both Optima's in Scottsdale which are much higher end offer guest parking in the garage for free. (Behind the secure gates but it's still in the garage) and Mark Taylor being built across the street from Skysong will offer guest parking within the gated community at no additional cost as it's a standard throughout all their communities - Also, it seems that the quality of workmanship that went into the building doesn't seem to be high quality. New neighbors are heard fighting (insulation sucks) although community claims it's foam insulated(highest quality insulation)   -My wood floors are a cheap laminate and the floor isn't even leveled.   *The maintenance team is however exemplary; extremely professional and nice great guys! Unfortunately I was "woo'ed" into Skysong and that's my fault.   If you have time to move I recommend waiting for Mark-Taylor across the street or a Camden Property. Both are established residential property companies managed by the owners as opposed to a community (like Skysong)which hired a management company to manage their day to day operations.   **Its important to understand that the information I provided is my feedback and is based off my experience. For basically $2k/month I expect an easier and more pleasant experience as well as a higher standard of living. I will be leaving at the end of my lease and not renewing**

This place continues to get worse, I don't even know where to start. I literally woke up at 3am Bc of screaming kids at the pool- do I have the energy to get up and complain? Yes! Do I? No! Why? Every other time it took at least an hour for it to stop, I'm assuming it wasn't even the security; rather it was the party animals probably just calling it a night.

Marilee and Patrick are redefining the moving experience. I reached out to Marilee 6 days before needing to move out of state (never recommended) and she was able to accommodate our move from Scottsdale to San Jose. It wasn't just the accommodation; it was their amazing empathy, friendliness, and genuine honesty and concern that make them amazing individuals who run an HONEST, REPUTABLE, and PREDICTABLE business. Dose Moving is the elite of the elite and I would never use anyone else! Think that was it- NO! They managed to go from door to door (have everything delivered) in a matter of 48 hours (they could have done 24 hours if I was able to make it) it's incredible- the movers got to my new home before I even could! Please save yourself the headache of dealing with the stereotypical movers who price rape you when it's too late and use DOSE Moving! They tell you how it is and set the right expectation from the very beginning! Great experience compared to any industry and any service I ever received!
