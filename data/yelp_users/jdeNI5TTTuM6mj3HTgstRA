I think I got lost and ended up in "Soft Rock Lounge".  Sure, the manufactured decorations are sleek, and the furniture is comfortable, but what do you really have to look forward to? A weak beer selection with the bar running out of the crafts? $14 burgers that don't look interesting? I guess it's cool to come here to say you've gone to one, but everyone I know says it's the worst they've been to in the US. I have nothing to compare it to just yet, but I should have listened.   Two stars because they have a groovy sound system and seem to support local artists. But I get that at a lot of places with good food/drink and no bums lurking outside the front door.

A cool place where thousands of basketball fans can gather, watch the game, and leave without flooding local traffic for miles like Westgate does. Came here trashed for a Suns/Lakers game, and was happy the seats in row 14 didn't completely suck for someone with super long legs like myself.  I don't know much about arena management, but with zero hassle, US Airways is doing it right. A lucky win and rowdy crowds make it comfortable enough to watch my favorite team and enjoy every minute!  Protip: Parking is easy if you just stop a half mile (northwest) away.

So good, I'll eat on a patio when it's 35 degrees out.   Gone are the days of diners as restaurants with incredibly greasy food and questionable cleanliness. The future of diners is here, with its eclectic flavors that appeal to carnivores and vegans alike. You're going to find the dish for you here, I guarantee it.   There's a small trailer with indoor bar seating. Good luck getting in there, as the space is obviously limited. For everyone else, you're gonna walk up to a window and swiftly have your order placed. They take cash and credit, as long as you're not too much of a "baller" carrying above $20 bills. I think some RoRo newcomers might have trouble with that. ;-)   A little birdie on my shoulder told me to keep it simple and go with, well, the Little Birdie. With simply fried chicken and cheddar on a biscuit, it's great to test the waters and see how welcome really shines. My chicken was perfect! I would seem it took a little dip in buttermilk before being introduced to a tasty batter. I can really tell these cooks know their chicken. The biscuit was amazing as well--I'd go as far as to say it's the best I've had on this side of the Mississippi. My vegetarian dining companion went with the jackfruit fries. I'd only had the fruit once before, and I'm not an expert on preparation, but I will say it was definitely tasty and a great meat substitute.   Everything was washed down with a pint of PBR, but if you want something a little fancier, there are a few craft beers, and a generous cocktail list. For a very small price, I walked away happy and eager to return!

Now that they have more reasonable hours, I popped in for a quick dinner I won't soon be forgetting. Seriously...this is one of the few spots on Central not open late!  I made it at 7-ish, not realizing they closed at 8. I didn't want to be THAT GUY, but staff was definitely still eager to serve a first timer. We kicked off supper with bread and olive oil. Theirs was the best olive oil I've enjoyed on this side of the Atlantic. Delicious, even if the thick, fresh bread was a tad sweet for my taste.   In mere minutes, I was delightfully presented with the "Sonny Boy", a simple pizza with soppressata + kalamata, or in painfully layman terms, pepperoni and olive. I usually hate olives, even kalamata, but these were good. There are limits to any desirable quality in a pizza. We don't want it to be too salty, and surprisingly this was not. We don't want the sauce, crust, or any singular element to overpower another aspect, and for the most part, it was all well balanced. I was able to appreciate it all.   My only criticism is the cheese itself, which would be refreshing in a caprese or on a white pie, but was just not BOLD enough. It was too milky. Too fatty, even. After doing the most extensive research that has ever gone into a review, perhaps this is from using a more local product rather than the rare Mozarella Di Bufala variety that's hard to get your hands on, but has an unforgettable taste.   It was so, so close to perfection. Or perhaps I've got some leveling up to do before reaching the status of a true cheese aficionado. Feel free to give your input.   Overall, this is very VERY good pizza, decent bread, and great service. As they closed, they even gave us a complementary loaf to-go.  I was honestly hoping to just grab a sandwich, which I will return to do on the rare occasion I'm not on Central for the nightlife. I wish I could give a 4.5, but since they were nice, a full 5 stars it is. That's what being nice gets ya. =)   PS--I still can't believe my Yelp friends bragged about waiting in line for 3 hours to get a Bianco pie back in the day. Dummies.

For reasons unknown, I have a bias against English food. So when the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen were a bit unappealing, I knew this place was authentic.   This place looks a bit old, but not trashy. When I ordered my Jameson and ginger ale, being asked if I'd like it in a pint glass made my day. This bar is awesome. There's a nice selection of beers for a reasonable $5 a pint. I had some Ace Pear, but there were tons of ales I'd never heard of to choose from. I'll be back for those.  There are plenty of activities to keep busy while getting trashed here. I've never seen so much room in a bar devoted to dartboards. It was right in the corner with ample throwing room, and I loved it! There are also a couple billiards tables, some light gun arcade game (Try it after a few--don't shoot the cows!) and even some patrons sitting at poker tables.   I'm definitely coming back here to play darts and watch rugby. Maybe I'll even try their fish and chips. I wonder though...do Brits really hang out here?

The bacon and blue cheese fondue burger with parmesan garlic fries is my favorite burger/fries combo anywhere. Ever. Without rival. I find a few of the mainstay brews to be rather pedestrian (I'm looking at you, Light Rail Cream Ale), but their strong ales are great to drink with such a hearty meal. If there's a cask IPA, you NEED to go for it!  Service is still awesome, and there are two separate rooms to dine in, as well as a patio. I prefer chilling at the second bar while watching some sports.   Their happy hour is still legit, and IIRC still all-day Sunday. $4 pints is OK with me for local crafts, and while I still am not a fan of every appetizer they have, they've definitely improved while staying at a very low price. Definitely a great supper spot for me, and sometimes I have so much fun I catch a mighty buzz from day drinking. While I wish that Uwe guy would bust out with more imperial reds and coffee stouts more often, Sun Up definitely has what it takes to keep me coming back.

Groovy concept, flawless service, nice variety, really cool drinks.  Get the plum soda. It's a small glass of some plum wine that'll knock your socks off, with a splash of club soda, and an "ume", some sort of small Eastern plum at the bottom. There are tons of sake based beverages, beer mixed with grapefruit juice or calpico (google it, n00bs), and some cool non-alcoholic beverages.  Then, there's the sushi. More than reasonable pricing for the location and decor. I was feeling awfully Arizonan that day, so I ordered the "baja norte" just to be brave and try a fun, albeit bastardization of sushi. Spicy yellowtail was actually spicy! Yay! It was just a *little* too salty, however. It was still a steal, and there are still a couple dozen other options if you're pretentious about experimental rolls like yours truly.  Apparently there's a ton of stuff here I need to try, and fortunately I can do just that without breaking the bank! Take a little detour from the light rail area and give Cherry Blossom a chance.

Blues? LOL I came here to check out some rock. This is an intimate venue, in which you can expect to be fully enveloped by sound. There's no room to really move around, as the stage was clearly designed for more chill shows. Learn to look cool like yours truly by sipping a PBR and standing around looking at your shoes the whole time.  In between sets, grab a drink from the bar. Prices are very reasonable for a music venue, but the beer on tap is WAY too warm. Seriously, they should adjust that. You can also recover your hearing on the spacious patio, just beware the perpetual cloud of smoke.   Overall, I like this place. I'd come back. It's got character.

The type of dive bar that existed before your favorite little microwinery. If you like places like these, we'd probably be good friends. There's a couple dozen different dinner options for $6-7 bucks each, and while the beef may not be grass-fed or the presentation remotely nice, it's good hangover protection.   You can even make half orders of any appetizer for $3.25 if you're watching your portions. Nifty, right? Restaurants are never that flexible and inexpensive.   The draft beers are scarce, but at least they had Sierra Nevada Torpedo, one of my faves. I'll come back when I'm not trying to get some Untappd badges.   tl;dr It's simple. It's a dive. It's good. Go.

Easily one of the best day drinking spots in the valley, especially to watch a game. First of all, the appetizers are just crazy cheap during happy hour, and it way generous portions at that. $3.75 for a plate of decent calamari? Sweet. The same price for a generous portion of hummus and pita? Score! Wash it down with the nice tap selection...they have some four peaks brews, and of course a modest liquor selection that covers he basics.  You can bet on horse races if you have any idea what you're doing. Or you can grab a table and yell at the TV as loud as you want. People here are nice enough to be chill about it. The staff is both kind and prompt. I like.

The employees are great! Everyone is so friendly and seems to genuinely enjoy being there, probably because of the reasonable prices, quality products, and quintessential kitsch. I can find everything I need, and then some.   They've got the best, most unique junk food ever. Cookie butter, anyone?   Their wine selection is on fleek.   They're like a luxury grocer that doesn't make you feel like you're in a luxury grocer, because they are so cool.

I don't think there's much to Zen 32 besides looking trendy.  Something seemed strange about the place when I walked in, and after reading other reviews it's been pointed out--the waitresses are wearing Chinese attire with Mandarin collars. I won't hold the lack of authenticity against them. Also, the music is soft and the seating kind of cramped, making for an awkward dining experience.  I'll get the good thing out of the way--the reverse happy hour. The hot ginger sake was overpowering, but for $1 there's no way I can complain. Also, they had a few basic rolls for $3, and that's not too bad.   Everything else sucks! The specialty rolls are all stuffed with krab, so what hope do you have of ever getting quality sushi? My tootsie roll was garbage, I couldn't taste anything beside the krab inside. The caterpillar roll looked nice, but I could only taste krab and eel sauce. Even the rainbow roll looked promising, and THAT was drenched in sriracha.   I also had some of this teriyaki chicken entree, and it was rough and a bit dry. The edamame had way too much salt, and I began noticing a pattern to this place. Take crap and season it as much as you can.  I'd like to give this place a second chance for a cheap date or something, but I'm still a little angry at this place (and their sketchy waitress!), for being the first to make me tired of sushi. A friend bought me this meal and I still regret it. It's that bad.

It took me a bit of traveling before I really started to appreciate this airport. Here are the finer aspects that set Sky Harbor apart from most travel hubs.  +Local dining. You get a real feel for the area's cuisine. Not just with the authentic Mexican or delicious Tex Mex options, but with local pizza, and stuff like La Grande Orange. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sea of Sbarro's/McDonald's/Starbucks and other chains as my only options.   +It's near the center of the city. Most airports are at least a half hour drive outside of any significant neighborhood. That means when your destination is Phoenix, it's very easy to get around. There are even very affordable shuttle services to take you to Flagstaff/Tucson.   +No matter where your gate is, you will have adequate seating, places to charge your phone, and places to shop.   Of course, not everything is peachy keen.   -I have had longer waits for security and baggage claim here than any other airport I've been to.   -WiFi blows, but to be fair it blows at a lot of airports.   Overall, the worst part about being here is the need to have some patience for getting through luggage and security. Other than that, it's a nice place!

Even though I grew up in Arizona, I never really cared for Mexican pastries.   I've changed my mind.   Empanada de calabaza? It's like October in my mouth, and I love it.   Cochitos? I'm usually not a fan, but these were good.   Conchas? Very fresh, but I'm not going crazy over them. It's worth a try from someone who is a better judge than myself.  I don't know the names of everything, I just know that the morsels covered in pink sugar were my favorite. They can be ordered in miniature sizes for a very sharable box of treats. This is legit.

Good enough to justify driving way out to Dullsville, AZ to find some great deals. I hate shopping, but O@A has me dropping not-so-big $ toward entire new wardrobes.  They've got racks on racks at Rack Room Shoes, where all the BOGO 1/2 off deals on brands like Timberland and Kenneth Cole take men's footwear excitement to new heights. That is, if you don't get distracted chuckling at all the old guys who think Crocs are cool.  I went to Van Heusen to dress it up, where there were some insane deals perfect for me. Stylish jackets to fit this lanky 6'4" gentleman for only $70. Unreal! Clearance on slacks, ties, and shirts so inexpensive I don't want to shop anywhere else for my business professional needs.   After that, I got sporty at the Nike store. all the gear you could ask for at reduced prices, and I can't spend too much time there without starting a sneaker collection. The selections were awesome!   Keep in mind not *every* store here will rock your socks off. The Vans store blows. The food court is not that good compared to other malls...well except maybe that BBQ place. Hey--a man's gotta refuel in between mass shopping.  Overall, this is THE outlet in the valley. If you thought Tanger was cool, step your game up and make the trip to Anthem.

If "dive bar" were in the dictionary, it would have a picture of Jupe's. This place feels like the middle of nowhere, in a strip mall far removed from anything noteworthy whatsoever. This appears to be the only attraction with a one-mile radius, and something about that inspires patrons to get really really trashed.   They've got a kinda sorta punk rock thing going on.   They keep their liquor bottles (like Jager) IN THE FREEZER. It's like being at a house party! 4/5 would come back.

One of the only pizza places I get really excited to visit. It has a lot of Italian-American food...calzones, lasagna, strombolis, and they're all freaking delicious.  My favorite is the mouthwatering double-deckeroni pizza. Double pepperoni, a spicy pizza sauce, and an awesome cheese blend that sends my taste buds straight to heaven, arteries be damned. For the purists out there: Yes, we know it's not *really* Chicago style, but who cares when it's this tasty? You can always get the thin crust.  They also have an extensive beer selection. They boast 110 brews, and you can take a "world tour" of beer. Basically, you can record every drink you order on a membership card, and when that's done, you get your very own witty one-liner on a plaque in the waiting area. Really cool concept, but I offer some criticisms--too many of the beers are stuff we've already had. Do I really have to drink one more of the same domestic drafts to make it? What a chore. There's another list for the various martinis they have, but unfortunately those are hit or miss.  This is a great place to stuff your face, get a nice buzz, and watch the game. Shout out to the waitress that introduced me to Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. She gave this review just enough of a boost to give it four stars.

"NO CLUB COLORS"  Signs like this on the front door prove that where Peoria and Glendale meet is the real hood of the valley. If I weren't a sucker for a little danger to spice things up, I might have said "lol no", turned around, and trotted back to some Scottsdale dive with a bathroom butler who will wipe my ass for me.   I never go to Scottsdale, but I assume that's what happens there, right?  Glad I didn't. This place has a decent beer selection, and an insanely good happy hour. $1.75 domestic drafts until 6:30? No. Freaking. Way. No wonder their most boisterous patron was a blatant alcoholic.   Bastard spilled ice cold Budweiser on my TOMS!   But I can overlook that. The pool tables are relatively new. The sound system was totally kickin', even though those damned internet jukeboxes are a dollar a song! I'm certain I'll come back, but not before contemplating the important questions.   Hmm...another brew, or a couple of tunes? Decisions, decisions...

Big middle finger goes out to Panda right now, Japan is my new "Express" for a quick Asian food fix. You should already know better than to get sushi from these types of places, so if you insist, just get something deep fried and smothered in eel sauce. Yes, it's an abomination to real sushi, but it's pretty darn tasty.  The bowls here are cheap, and come out so fast you just KNOW it wasn't made fresh. The spicy terriyaki chicken bowl was so scrumptious that I didn't care. And for a total of around $7, I inhaled it, washed down with a bottle of Ramune soda. Delicious.

I hope they don't take it personally, but this place blows. I appreciated the pool tables and the couple of games lined up against the wall, but when I just came from a place not too far that has twice as many (and more space, too!) I just couldn't be impressed.  But let's get down to business.  The bar was terrible. The selection was sparse, and disorganized. I saw a flask (What's a flask doing on a bar counter?) of Smirnoff next to a small bottle of jager, with a bottle of pinnacle butterscotch vodka on the top and center. That's just tacky.   I was stuck on the butterscotch vodka for some reason, and when I asked what a good mixer may be, I was met with a clueless shrug and impatient stare. Yes, I know I can be clueless at times, but I feel the mark of any bartender worth their salt is the ability to be engaging, and have no shortage of ideas for curious clientele. It's how you retain customers and make your establishment a more exciting place to be.   The patio is also awkward. The outdoor bar stools face a grill, but when no one is grilling you have only a wall and an empty elbow of a strip mall to look at. Booooring.  So when my buddy ordered a nice little well drink, it came out pretty pricey for a desolate Monday night. I don't expect classy or popular bars to have reverse happy hours, but there are way too many dives that will give the same thing for less in a more awesome place, it feels like a waste of time.  I tried to think of reasons to bump this place up to two stars. Apparently they are very active during the day, where whatever few patrons they have are excited for barbecue and cheap beer during the afternoon happy hour. But cheap food/beer during the day is easy as hell to find, and exists in much cooler places than next to a grocery store, and is served by much less apathetic staff.  I don't *hate* you, Swizzle Stick, there are just way better places to spend time and money.

On week nights, 5030 has ONE DOLLAR DRINKS.  I can't emphasize that enough. It's the "power hour", sun-thurs from 10-midnight. One dollar well drinks and domestic bottles. I hope I have your attention now.  If money is not an object for you, then rest assured! I gave this place four stars for more reasons than that. It's got pool tables, a few games, and tons of seating. There are even some comfy booths in the corner and an auspicious dancing pole for ladies who've imbibed just the right amount.  Both bartenders that have served me here are already some of my favorites. They know what they are doing, and have no shortage of suggestions for what to drink or how to drink it, a quality that I feel is the mark of a successful server. They had a friendly and sociable aura about them, something I'm not used to seeing in dives around here.  The liquor selection is top notch. Every tequila, whiskey, and vodka I could ask for in a bar are in no shortage here. They even had some liquors I'm not used to seeing--I tried my first shot of AGWA and loved it!   Next time, I'll be back for that special they have on pitchers of Leinenkugel. This bar has everything I like (good heavens, KILTLIFTER's on tap, too!) and I can't wait to bring tons of friends. Just so you know, there is no kitchen and no patio, but you can overlook that. 5030 just took some business away from its competitors.

I've been here like a zillion times! Not just because it's the best Silver Q location, but because it's been a consistently good experience for the better half of a decade that I've popped in. Seriously, I was such a regular that this is where you would assume you could find me if I didn't pick up my flip phone. Yeah, me and the Q go way back like that.   Anyway, I hadn't stopped by for like a year, probably the longest I've gone without a check in, just to see if it was good as always. It was better.   -The clientele aren't a bunch of rambunctious 18-20 year olds anymore. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I just don't wanna feel like an old man. :-p  -The three projections on the wall next to each other are freaking awesome. Rumor has it that these can be utilized for gaming, which would only further confirm the score I'm giving it.   -The hookahs are way better than they used to be. The owner makes them correctly, arguably better than anyone I've encountered in the valley. And I've been to a LOT of these. :-o  I could go on, but this somehow manages to be a BETTER establishment than what I remember. Play some pool, watch the game, have some Starbuzz or something. No regrets.

Tony's is the bar the northwest valley needs right now, and the bar it deserves. $2 Sierra Nevada IPA? $3 Stella? Is this real life?   Lots of pool tables, darts, some arcade games, and ample seating. Also the youngest crowd I've seen in any watering hole lining 59th avenue. And like yours truly, they're into the day drinking! My only regret is not discovering this place sooner.

Had enough beer to think this was one of those hip, retro bars.  Platinum blonde indie girl spinning old-school gangster rap from 20 years ago...IRONICALLY. It's cool because you're superficial and don't expect her to play that.   Bunch of guys repping Extreme Sports fashion like Monster Energy caps with their Ed Hardy shirts...IRONICALLY. It's cool because no one seriously wears that anymore, and it's a great throwback to simpler times.   Not much for pastafarianism, I tried chilling out with my modern, 2010s clothes and music taste. Didn't fit in. But fear not! Chilly Bombers has some redeeming aesthetics. Like...the pretty lights (so bright!). Or the huge (and unfortunately vacant) dance floor.   When I closed my eyes just long enough to stop the spinning, I envisioned how much cooler this bar could be if it tried to be a little more dive-y, and a little less of a refuge for people too broke or afraid of Hurricane Bay*.   *I can't believe I just used HB as a favorable alternative to something.

This is an above average sports bar that should be on the agenda of anyone who lives in surrounding neighborhoods.   The seating is expansive! Plenty of seats at the bar for when you're out with a few bros, and the patio was able to accommodate a large outing of a couple dozen people.   The beer selection is surprisingly great. They've got dozens of taps, and a few of them, such my Elysian Space Dust IPA, are examples of good lesser-known brews you don't run into every day.   I really only tried some apps like mozzarella sticks or quesadillas, and they were OK. The menu is huge, so you'll find something that doesn't disappoint.   I'd come out here to watch sports, get my beer snobbery on, or even play Cards Against Humanity. Nice job on giving me something fun to do in the north valley.

It's a sports bar that's also an amazing place for pan pizza. The happy hour apps are delicious, but I don't even care because I like their deep dish too much to get anything else. What really shines here is the bar seating that's separate from everything. Here, you'll find dozens of beers on tap. Not just the domestic swill, but really good stuff like Goose Island. On Sunday nights, they have some insane special with like $3 pints for anything. ANYTHING.  And even though it's a family restaurant, I almost never see kids running around! Scores highly on atmosphere, especially when I'm watching baseball (Go Brewers!). I still prefer it to certain other pizza parlors that have opened further down Bell Road.

For some reason, sushi brings out the snob in Americans. Unfortunately, it has been less of an opportunity to dine on high quality uncooked seafood, and more of a showcasing of who can look trendiest or appear to have the best taste.  When I'm done making fun of newbies who prefer California rolls, and tired of gaudy decorations, I need a place that gets down to business. A place where you can chill out and and stuff some salmon in peace.  Tokyo Lobby is that place.  The traditional rolls are always tasty, and I don't recall any individual item being more than about $10. What really shines here are the specialty rolls. I tried the 'Orgasm' and the flavor blew my mind. I really wanted the Sex on the Beach, but to my dismay the chef was out of the bananas for the tempura. Curses, but you knew I'd be back anyway!  My only problem is that I feel the eel sauce is too sweet...reminded me of an allspice flavor as opposed to the more savory sauces I've sampled elsewhere. Also, the seating is a bit crowded and they're closed on Sunday! That alone has lost them several visits from me. STILL WORTH IT.  Next time you're on Bell Road craving sushi, visit Tokyo Lobby and get a quality product without seeing swarms of snobs. You'll thank me later.

This "Mexican" dining experience is the least authentic I've ever had.  The crispy chicken flautas tasted like convenience store 'taquitos'.  Their quesadillas had great tortillas that were admittedly tasty, but the cheese was questionable. Other Yelpers have pointed out it tastes like Velveeeta, which I'm not down for in a sit-down establishment like this.  The chimichanga is the worst I've ever had. The beans are too sweet, and don't even taste like they should be used for Mexican food. I tried to douse a portion with the habanero sauce at the table, but that was even sweeter. It was...gross, to sum it up in nice terms.  Don't get me wrong, I don't HATE this place, it's just really lame food for such a great location, decor, and the friendly staff. The tequila menu is pretty legit, so I might swing by again while I'm shopping.

This is the only indoor mall worth visiting in the West Valley.   Food court is above average. Gotta love having choices like Johnny Rockets and Orange Julius.  Getting my shop on here isn't half bad. When I'm not stuck in ties and slacks, I know I can visit spots like Aeropostale or Pac Sun and dress it down on the cheap. If you're looking for electronics, they've got that, too, with a massive Apple Store, as well as Radio Shack.   So if you want a clean, convenient shopping experience, make this your stop. Except for Sundays...ugh...the parking lot is horrendous.

Typical suburbanite "Mexican" food with no fresh ingredients. If you're looking for something like Macayo's, but less tasty, this is your spot. It was very crowded today, which was a good sign. I saw tons of seniors here (that makes sense, given the name), and it's because they have a huge senior menu for them. They come from a time where food was not nearly this fake, so I refuse to believe they actually think this is good stuff.  Let's get the good stuff out of the way--the bar. $3 margaritas made with 1800 tequila? Perfectly blended in a 12 oz.. cup? Yes, please! It's awesome seeing a happy hour on Sunday afternoon, so this was a pleasant surprise. They also had the "cerveza rita", served in a goblet with a coronita (7 oz. corona bottle) stuck in it. Outside of the blended drinks, it looked like nothing special. You're out of your mind if you think I'm paying $17 for a bottle of Sutter Homes. Most of their wine list is the swill I'd use for wine pong, but that's another story.  The chips and salsa were decent. The hot stuff is one of the better salsas I've had in the valley, perhaps it was made with smoked poblano? I want to buy a bottle for myself. The seven layer dip was tolerable since I was so hungry. refried beans, ground beef, sliced green chili, sour cream, guac, and of course, cheese sauce. Perhaps the seventh layer was the suspicious film on the dip when it was brought to our table. Questionable.  My entree arrived, and I was disappointed just by looking at it. Why did the beans already look dry? Perhaps they were overcooked? It was as if they were sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time. The rice was decent, but also dry. My fajita chicken chimi looked a bit...narrow, and the tortilla didn't look properly fried. I freaking love chimichungas, so I had to dig in post haste!   Most disappointing chimi I've ever had. Once during finals week, I was so busy that I bought some fajita chicken in a bag, complete with the fake grill marks. I recognized the taste right away, and proceeded to dissect my meal. There were cubes and 'strips' of chicken...and eureka! The fake grill marks. At home, this is tolerable in a pinch. For $11 at arrowhead? This is a piece of shit!  If you EVER see me check in here, it's for the tapas and margaritas during happy hour. I'll be sitting at the swank bar, flirting with some octogenarian's daughter who came here against her will. Outside of that, Abuelo's ain't up to snuff  Bar-3.5 Food-1

Hey, wait a second. Since when are pizza parlors this cool? Not only are they a sit down restaurant and delivery spot during the day, they turn into a dive bar at night. Can't say I've seen much of that! And the beers are as cheap as they get. $2 pints of Killian's Red? So awesome that my liver just flinched.  The pizza is just alright. Sweet sauces can be awesome, but only if you have the right crust and cheese to balance that out. On top of that, I know a meaty pizza can get greasy, but Pullano's is excessively so. In hindsight, the $13 for the 16" really wasn't worth it, but maybe if you wait for some of the specials they have on Wednesday, you can sample a cheaper one for yourself. The menu is VERY expansive, too, which tells me you're pretty much gonna get more of the same as far as quality.  3 as a pizza place, but a solid 5 as a dive.

Reading your reviews, I expected a smelly, run-down dive that was all sorts of crazy. I saw nothing of the sort. It looked pretty clean for a dive, had some awesome seating, and a decent tap selection. It's such a small bar, but they do a great job of utilizing that space. The crowd is pretty cool, too. If only it weren't so inaccessible, right in the middle of an ugly part of town, with very little parking. I won't count the horrors of CenPho against it.  Chug some PBR and wait for all the hipsters to migrate from Trunk Space.

This venue is so small, poorly ventilated, and just plain seedy to put it nicely, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. The Trunk Space has blown my mind with music I doubt I'd stumble upon any place else.  Think of the strangest musical act you've ever seen, and Trunk Space would book them. In between sets, feel free to grab a drink at their espresso bar. They also have some pretty unique soft drinks, like "Leninade", or Ginger Beer.  At some times it also acts as an art gallery. Hell, I've even seen improv comedy. Truly worth a shot no matter what you're in the mood for.  Some argue that this place attracts too many 'x', where 'x' is a group they just can't coexist with for a two hour show (usually teenagers and hipsters). Those are the only people not welcome at the Trunk Space. The rest of us will have a blast!

Carne asada is alright, but you've gotta put more effort into your food than handfuls of shredded cheese on most menu items. On my second visit, I opted for the green chile burrito...the tortilla was nothing special, and the chile was bland. You call THAT a green sauce?  As the green, gravy like mixture spilled everywhere, I tried to enjoy it with some tortilla chips. Their chips aren't anything special either. I like the salsa bar and the atmosphere, but when it comes to a quick Mexican dining experience, I know you can do tons better. I don't hate this place, but the bar is set higher in the desert.

Low, red lights paired with even lower ceilings give Char's an intimate, romantic atmosphere unparallelled anywhere in the valley. Vibes are sultry, and the crowd seemed to all be paired up. It's so hot, I think there's a 99% chance of getting laid after a night here.   When my friends told me I have what it takes to become a "one percenter", this is NOT what I had in mind.  It's cool though to come with your friends. This is high-quality entertainment. Where else are you gonna catch a couple hours of soul and R&B covers in a town like this? For the low, low $6 cover, we were grooving to everything from The Temptations to Blackstreet. Legit. I got there around 11:00, so expect standing room only. You'll be lucky to sit at the bar.   The booze selection is reasonable, they've got all the basics, and it's very fair compared to your average music venue. I mean, come on...a cab sauv for six bucks? Yesssss. I felt like a boss still in my work clothes, clutching my glass as though I'm appreciative of the subtleties of flavor while I'm already buzzed, while looking on as most other patrons were looking fancy themselves. This has class. I like.   The only thing that might catch you off guard is closing time of 1am. If you don't know it in advance, you'll be disappointed when you get cut off before you

I thought I'd never be caught dead here! Me, stuck in a line outside a booming club at 1AM. Why is it so packed this hour?   Oh yeah, because it's apparently the biggest gay bar in town! It was literally at maximum capacity, but the hour or so I spent inside was a good time. I've never been to one of these before, but I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the atmosphere was. Bouncers who aren't dicks. People who actually just want to converse. Lots of couples. Tons of straight women taking refuge from creepers. Guys grabbing my butt! (guess that comes with the territory)   But between the fog machine, happy people, and ridiculously low ATM fees, I wouldn't mind coming back here with my friends. Even if there are wangs on the TV screen. Weird.

I like the six pool tables in the back of the room. You probably won't have to wait if you wanna play! Yes, the jukebox is legit as well...it's got a lot of the more underground, independent rock and rap. And the sound system does every track justice.   Drink prices are meh...for a grimy place with more rugged patrons, I'm used to seeing a bit lower. Draft beer selection is less appealing than I'm used to in this neck of the woods. Having one unique brew just doesn't cut it these days!   Another weird thing about the layout is that there's not really a place to sit besides the bar or next to the billiards. A lack of tables to socialize with your friends tells me it might not be THE best place for groups, since you'll all just stand around awkwardly. Maybe it deserves another chance during peak hours. Maybe I'm just missing something really cool about this place. For now, it doesn't seem to do anything better than other bars in the area, and that really lowers the return factor for me.

Laundry hasn't been this easy since my mom did it all.   I have very few items that need dry cleaning, so it's rare I visit these types of places. I really just need something easy and reliable, and this is it!   Open at 7am, and if you drop your stuff off by 9, it's ready at 4, so I don't have to play guessing games like I have before with other cleaners.   The service is incredibly fast, with staff available to help immediately, all for the low price of $2.75 per garment! I am pleased with the quality of work done as well. Regal has made a regular out of me.

Spectrum...Chris Town...which is it? Either way, calling it a "mall" is really an insult to malls. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that the strip mall, which includes a sporting goods store and a Petsmart, is part of this place.  The interior is small, like depressingly small. Is this really the go-to place for people living in the crappier part of downtown to shop? I feel sorry for them. There's a BBB Fashion if you're into overpriced urban clothing that won't last. There are also an assortment of booths that change every time I walk in.  Personally, I still go out of my way for one thing: The Costco. Because I don't have a minivan full of kids to feed, having a membership is pointless for me. But damn, am I addicted to their cafeteria food. What makes this one different is the dining area is open to the public, meaning yours truly can be spotted here stuffing his face with pizza, churros, and chicken bakes. That's why it earns a second star.

I've never had the idea to pour wine on my burgers while I cook them. That's just plain weird, but obviously these guys are on to something with a simple menu that works. Bacon and blue cheese are the best burger toppings ever, and I pity the fool who puts on garbage like *cringe* a fried egg. I didn't order sides like fries, because those are the emptiest calories ever, and opted for something healthier...a $4 gin & grapefruit.   Gotta get all my food groups in when I can.   The alcohol selection is better than I expected. You can choose your spirit and your juice (but really my drink is the way to go), or some decent crafts, featuring lesser-known breweries like Montana's Big Sky.   While you're at it, watch some baseball. Apparently this is also a Vikings bar during football season. There are more seats and a pool table in the back, but I'm not sure when that half is opened up. I'll come back on a weekend and get that figured out for you, but until then, don't pass this place up!

Whataburger was the go-to, All-American spot before In-N-Out came to Arizona. I really don't see them around any more, but to run into one that's open 24 hours was refreshing.  It's super clean  Everyone is polite  The food is above average for the industry.   Get the patty melt.   Whoever manages this location is doing a great job. I usually say "meh, it's just fast food" when it comes to Yelp reviews, but if you're on the freeway late at night and want a quick bite, go here.

Smells like an Asian grocery store in here! Feels good man. Check out the fish tanks in the back--I like to know my seafood was freshly beheaded mere minutes before landing on my plate.  So far, I've sampled the dim sum. Pork shu mai all day--it's legit! Perfectly marinated pork AND heavily spiced shrimp...when I return, I'll try my best to try something different. Like chicken feet.  This is really what authentic Chinese looks like, and I'm happy to have found it. I'll be back for more treats from the Far East...and the full bar!

I made a really big mistake thinking laser tag is something just for kids. For $10, you get 20 minutes of light exercise--and time to mimic funny laser sound effects while you snipe away at unsuspecting competitors. Ours was a 24-player free-for-all with no little runs to worry about, I walked briskly (running is not allowed, and for good reason!) with my gaudy gear and blasted away.   At the end of each match, score cards are given out to show who you've hit the hardest...and who deserves revenge! I want to bring my team here as often as possible, since it's a good, clean way for everyone to have a good time.   Protips  -Don't stand in one spot -Repeatedly shoot people who don't move -The second floor is for pros -Don't wear anything that will glow in black light  Have a blast! After you're done, cool down with some air hockey or Dance Dance Revolution.

It's 3am on a Wednesday morning, and you can't walk straight. With a stomach that's only known a liquid diet for the last six hours, you tell your DD this will be much better than Jack in the Box. The night's been full of questionable decisions...one more couldn't hurt, right?  La Salsita has a nice array of different meats and veggies all ready to be loaded into a tortilla. If you want something quick like a burrito, it's like Chipotle for people who aren't afraid of Mexicans.

Desert Sky seeks to fill the demands of its Maryvale customers, but ends up sucking anyway. Don't get me wrong, I like some aspects of this mall...like how so many businesses are independently owned. Virtually everything in the food court is one-of-a-kind. Even the McDonald's has been ousted. Bravo.   That being said, just because it's independent doesn't mean it won't blow. You'll find tons of cheap crap on "sale", but you're really overpaying for clothes that won't last. In between stores, you'll encounter some of the most aggressive salespeople in any mall ever. In most shopping centers, they can afford to be reasonable and soft with their approach. Here, there is no way to escape them without being a jerk.  The anchor stores suck so bad. Except Burlington Coat Factory, which is always awesome. La Curacao is basically a Spanish Best Buy--except worse--with even higher markups and some credit practices that raise an eyebrow. Sears is the worst Sears I've ever set foot into. Good luck finding any decent selection of clothing or electronics.   Full disclosure: I've held several jobs throughout this mall as a teenager. But that was five years ago...long enough to Yelp about it, right?

It's a basic bar.   There's nothing exceptional to drink here, just the same old domestics on tap. Liquor selection had nothing noteworthy either.   You could play a game of pool or darts, but it was quite crowded on a Saturday night, so you couldn't really enjoy it. There was standing room only, no patio, and a low quality sound system.   They don't even do tabs here. They will charge your card 20 or 40 dollars at a time, and just give you the difference in cash. That is just bizarre...at best. Just make it cash only.   Booze was cheap, and bartenders and security were very nice, however, so I guess I can give it two stars.

They have the best sesame chicken I've ever had. Yeah, there's tons of other good stuff, like the Mongolian beef or vegetable lo mein, but I keep coming back for the same thing almost every time. Prices are reasonable; you can get a meal for 2 for like $8. Is it in a crappy part of town? Oh heavens yes. But that's how you know it's legit. Don't wuss out, go out of your way to try a tasty, local restaurant.  Service is really nice, and they get your order out with haste. I just wish they'd bring back the 80s arcade machines in the dining area.

I have fond memories of coming here after school to indulge in the rare daytime meal that didn't taste vaguely of styrofoam. A few years and a few dozen burrito joints later, I've discovered this place kinda blows.   I don't want to make any accusations, but if you told me the sour cream was cut with that "sour topping" bullshit, I wouldn't be surprised.   Their guacamole is watery.   Their salsas are not spicy or flavorful. They don't add much to the meal.   At least they didn't screw up the carne asada. I love when it's got that grilled or skillet fried flavor, because it's kinda lame when it comes straight from just a pot. It's a small family-owned place that's got an expansive menu. There are only like 8 chairs inside. I'll try them again for old-times sake, but there's certainly not a rush.

I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.  They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line.   Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.  Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.  I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.

Legit Chinese food in the west valley.   Most definitely above average, as they bring a unique style to some of their dishes. They understand you can make good Chinese without deep frying everything in tons of batter and putting tons of sugar in. My sesame chicken and fried rice were surprisingly light and savory. More importantly, I didn't feel like passing out for like 12 hours after finishing it. The honey walnut shrimp (the proper name of which escapes me) was freaking delicious.  Of course, they seem to have less common items as well. Their special when I was there was a flounder in black bean sauce dish. Not something I've seen before, so I may have to give it a try! The menu really is pretty expansive with lots of the classics, as well as affordable lunch specials.  Other nifty aspects of Wong's are the really cool interior. It looks so fancy you'll feel the need to tuck in your shirt! Lots of room, and it's great for big groups. They're Yelp friendly as well, and serve up a groovy check-in deal. This is good stuff, and I'm happy to see something like it in the Avondale area.

I always had a bias against O'Brien's as the *other* bar on 35th & Northern. Now that it's the only one, and some buddies of mine were playing a show, I finally caved and checked it out. Did not regret.  It's a pretty roomy bar that fits tons of people. I liked the enclosed smoking patio, since my friends didn't have to leave to light up.   The drink specials are groovy. $1 lands you some cheap beer (PBR, I believe) and for $3.50 you'd get a frosty mug of Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss. I can drink that for days! There are tons of cheap shots listed above the bar, and I'll get around to trying them all.  The only downsides were slow service (this place seemed understaffed) and no stage for bands. They just clear some stuff out of the way, and people there to listen to music find themselves bumping into people sitting down watching the game. Feels awkward and disorganized.  But if you get drunk enough, will that really matter?

I've never been here, but my coworkers keep bringing this stuff into the office. It's great stuff! The cookies aren't too soft or too hard, and packed with flavor. The brownies...oh my, they're the best brownies I've ever had! They're so dense and full of cocoa, and the frosting on top augments the flavor without adding too much sugar.  And that's what I like about this place the most...I love baked goods, but a lot of them are too sweet for my taste. Baker Wee seems to focus on a quality product that tastes just as delicious as it looks.

This is the first place I'd ever tried sushi. Yum. It's not THE BEST, but it's serviceable.   So why five stars, you ask?   Because they've got more. Tons more. This is the only restaurant in existence where I can enjoy good sushi AND good pizza at the same time.   And then there's the happy hour. I haven't taken advantage of it yet because I never go to a mall to drink, but if I decided to get buzzed before I shop or go to a movie, this will be perfect. The upper level is also great for people watching!

Lights are flashing. Metal is blaring. Shots are pouring. Lanes are full.   And it's only Wednesday night. Sure last call for drinks comes at 11:15, but you want to save your 3AM binges for at least Thursday. Bowling is optional to have a great time here, and the drink selection is a cut above your average AMF bowling alley. If you like to get liquored up and hurl heavy objects, you've found paradise.

No matter how snobby you think old-town Scottsdale socialites can be, the truth is they like to get hammered and stuff their faces just like us real human beings. In the indiscriminate hours of 2-4 am, you can dine by the slice, or if you gotta have it fresh like yours truly then reject the premade meal and get yours made-to-order.  $20 for an 18" with two toppings is a bit pricey by some standards, but after shooting Patron all night like a rich bitch I could overlook it. They're busting out the dough and making my pie FRESH in the middle of the night, so tip them well. Crust is legit, cheese is REAL, stringy mozzarella. Staff is kind and quick; the manager keeps the young guys running around, working hard. This pizza is quality hangover protection.

More like "Cougar Ranch", am I right?  I have a habit of barhopping on Saturday nights, but this place has what I need to keep me tipsy and entertained. Started off by checking out the live music. People were being lame and just standing there watching the stage, so I sat back and enjoyed the scenery. Spacious room.  Make a pit stop at the outside bar. Have a seat, get some fresh air, let your ears recover, and mingle. Women over the age of 30 aren't exactly my type, but there are for sure some cute ones. Find some, and take them upstairs.  Upstairs is pretty fun. I'm not much of a club guy, but I can acknowledge when it's done correctly. There's a bass-dropping, light-flashing, ass-shaking dance floor, complete with another bar and some dancers on poles.   No question that your $5 cover is worth this 3-course party. Make this your next Old Town destination.

First of all, I'm really impressed how Zipp's manages to be so close to typical Scottsdale clubs, yet doesn't endure a smidgen of pretentious clientele. This is a place for large groups to chug beer, watch sports highlights, and if brave enough, chomp on greasy bar food.   $8 for a freaking pitcher of Ranger IPA made me a happy camper. That's all I really need! I can have one of those and call it a night. But you know me, I like to party.   Prices on shots like Fireball and Jager were also very reasonable. This is such a great place to be social; I like watching the occasional early walk of shame around 1:30 from the patio while I chat it up with friends.   Apps were interesting...I tried some sort of roast beef spring roll, but it wasn't my cup of tea. No matter what, the food is inexpensive, and the kitchen is open late. Men, if you don't want to deal with an army of bros and cheap cologne, come here. Ladies, if you don't feel like 5 inch heels and pushup bras, stop by. This place is fun.

It looked just kitschy enough to be an above-average brew, but fell flat on all levels. I ordered an iced soy latte...and, well, I'm not entirely sure they know what a latte is. I was expecting a couple shots of espresso with some soy milk (and okay, a dash of flavored syrup) thrown in.   I ended up with a gigantic, tasteless mess. Couldn't decipher whatever flavor it was supposed to be. It was like watered-down coffee thinned out even more by my beloved dairy substitute. This is what happens when you focus on quantity over quality...you get a 20+ oz. cup of very forgettable coffee-flavored water. I'd prefer my caffeine come in more...uh, concentrated packages if it's going to be so disappointing.    At least there appears to be a variety of hot sandwiches made-to-order. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and hope they deliver on that, because this road doesn't seem to favorable to the early birds of Tempe campus. Please practice hard at being good baristas, I don't want to see you lose every customer to the Memorial Union!

The Good  Service was impeccable. You get your ID checked in the middle of the day, so you know they're serious about a dining experience for grown-ups only. Waitress took my order right away. Food was fresh and ready at my table incredibly fast. Unlike their Scottsdale location, my fries weren't tough and my bread didn't seem stale. They are efficient and stylish.  The Bad  Criticism still stands regarding a very unadventurous menu. It's for the most part very generic bar fare that has no go-to dish that screams "wow, we're unique!" You could at least have something that rotates like your brews do. Talking up beer pairings doesn't make up for that. Also, parking blows, but why are you driving here anyway?   I know I sound really critical, but that's because I don't want the face of a local brewery to be some stick-in-the-mud on a culinary level. I don't necessarily get excited about this place, but service and atmosphere were outstanding, so my rating has to reflect such great management.

Love it or hate it, anyone who enjoys long nights in Tempe will eventually end up here from time to time.  I can only describe my feelings for this product with an analogy. I don't like cheap beers like Keystone or Natty Ice, but sometimes the situation calls for it and, well,  it gets me drunk. If you asked me how much I liked it, I'd reply "not at all", but if you put one in my face at the right time, you bet I'm gonna chug it.  After a night of that, my friends and I would probably take a bunch of wadded up ones and spend them here. Obviously, they provide a necessary service--late night, cheap pizza for the drunk and stoned urban youths of Arizona State. For that, I'll be nice about the varying levels of disappointment I've been served here and hope they at least improve the crust.  Seriously, I've had crackers with more flavor.

No cover to get in, and I get to shoot respectable liquors like Red Stag for $1 each?   Is this real life?  Vine is probably the most inexpensive, happening place you can spend a Monday night. And it's not just for college kids--I see a mix of people hanging out to sip on drinks and watching football in the evening. Later at night, there's live music and a patio with a passable social scene. There's a good bar menu, and while there are only two bartenders--they're rather efficient.   I understand not everything likes to get crazy so early in the week, but at this dive, the Tuesday morning after is worth it.

I've got plenty of hookah lounges to browse in the West valley, so when I venture out of my way to Red Sea, you KNOW it has to be for a good reason. They're such a minimalist lounge--couches, pillows, tables, small speakers. No fancy lighting, no Arabic TV...this is indeed a place to chill out.  They have an impressive shisha selection, with all brands from Al-Waha to Fumari. They take an interesting approach to hookah preparation, too. Instead of aluminum foil, there's a hard metal screen. Instead of wood charcoals or Japanese coals, there are instant lights. Don't get me wrong, I think instant lights are freaking disgusting, but Red Sea is the only place that can use them effectively. Major props.  Having visited for the first time under new ownership, I tried my best to troll some of the staff. They did a great job justifying their pricing ($2 cover for everyone, hookahs are slightly cheaper). And when we had a frank discussion about places to puff shisha around the valley, I noticed they were well-traveled. And no matter how much I encouraged them, they refused to badmouth the competition! Still, it was fun to try. :-p  That elusive 5th star, however, may be out of reach. A bad pairing to your quality product, your atmosphere is, well...rather boring. Do something about it.   Oh, and bring back that canopy in the corner. I'll be back to check on things.

I like the cozy, home-style atmosphere. I like the cashier's charming, inviting attitude. I like the options for toppings. I like the dessert selection. I like your prices.  But I just can't get into your pizza. Maybe it's my fault for ordering by the slice, and not a whole pie. I'm not expecting the freshest product, but I think mine was reheated more than once. Even individual servings shouldn't have rock-hard crust or visibly burnt edges. I understand that this place has a lot of heart, and for that I'm sure I'll give it another try for something beyond pizza, which I am a snob about. Had it been in pristine condition, IDK what about it would jump out. For now, it's a mystery why my friends are giving it nothing but 4+ stars.

What I remember the most from this visit is the patio bar serving me the weakest long island ever.  And the girls they hire as eye candy in front of windows who can't dance.  And all the ghetto people this bar attracts.   I guess the whole 2-for-1 drinks for ladies' night was cool, and the dance floor did seem pretty large. But there are too many places on this road that do it better, with better crowds. Meh.

WARNING: Cash or GTFO  The Chuck Box feels like a place where a bunch of gruff guys just decided to start a simple, no-frills cookout cafe from their backyard. I want to complain about the long, disorganized lines in which you place orders 8 spots from the grill by yelling what you want...but it seems to work. No one's order gets messed up.   The burgers are legit...nice quality, lean beef that you get to watch sizzle on the flame. Don't order yours well-done, or the staff will roll their eyes, and people like me will give you dirty looks for holding up the line. I got the Tijuana torpedo, which is just pepper jack and green chile. Even though the bun is a simple, wimpy sesame, it still holds up to be a nice meal. Fries aren't shabby, either. I'd like the burger to get seasoned just a tad bit, but then again there's a couple dozen condiments for you to choose from.  The menu is simple, affordable, and filling. You can grab a table and a beer and catch some sports. It's just an old-fashioned establishment that deserves to survive the gentrification of pretentious local-this and organic-that eateries.

Sometimes I just wanna sit on the patio with my friends and not worry about having to chase down a server or bartender to get a brew. Casey Moore's fills that void in my nightlife, I had to put *zero* effort into getting a pint. They even patiently made obnoxious, complex drink orders without showing the slightest signs of irritation.   This is what a perfect staff looks like. IDK about the food (not important) or like the restroom (size of a closet), but it gets 5 stars so that other bars' staff can perhaps down a black velvet while they take notes.

A nice, chill pizza parlor I like to watch games in. $2.50 domestic pints at all times isn't too shabby, but it's the food here that I enjoy most. Every time I order something, it's so hot I have to let it cool down. Part of me wonders if even a minute goes by between the pizza leaving the oven, and it arriving at my table.   The lunch special is also decent. I can get two big slices of cheese (the crust isn't too thin or too thick--it's just right!), a couple breadsticks, and a drink for $5. When I'm in the area and have an hour to spare, this is my happy place.

In 5 minutes, I found a badass blazer for 5 bucks. Browsing around a bit, I spied tons of potential outfits for that old-school look you just can't put together from other secondhand clothiers. Every rack is full of potential. You just need a good eye and a touch of luck to find something with that "WOW!" factor.  They accept cards, and the staff all seem to enjoy this place. Play some 90s arcade games, and grab some vintage garb of your own. You'll walk away looking like one sexy anachronism.

Spoiler Alert: This place makes Filibertos look like Taco Bell.  In the West Valley, a name like "Polibertos" doesn't stand out. There are dozens of little taco shops out here, you can't drive more than a mile without seeing one. But this place is anything but generic. In fact, it's AMAZING!  Everything you order here is bigger than you expect for the low prices. If you get anything besides a simple taco or burrito, use the buddy system because you'll NEED help finishing the majority of meals on their menu.   My favorite dish on the menu is the carne asada fries. The meat is thoroughly seasoned, and the whole dish is smothered in guacamole and sour cream. I was excited to see the cook throwing on two freaking handfuls of shredded cheddar to make it all oh-so perfect. It's $8, making it one of the most expensive eats they have, but it takes TWO people to finish it, unless you're Adam Richmond or something.   The place is always sparkling clean, it doesn't look shady, and the service is kind and quick. After I order, my food is usually out by the time I finish a game on the Ms. Pacman machine in the corner.  Best of all, the lobby (and drive thru!) is open 24 hours. So whether you're craving some chorizo for breakfast, or looking for a nice rich meal after a round of late night drinking, this is going to be your new spot. I extend my apologies to the countless competitors in the west valley--they've been outclassed.

Every Lenny's in the valley different. So if you like some of the others nearby with retro decor, or a good menu, you'll be sorely disappointed here.   First of all, the burgers themselves are pretty lame. It looks as though there's a variety, but they're mostly all the same, just with different sauces. I don't like traditional burgers, I like them to be a bit more creative: ex REAL cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, onion rings. None of that here, just cold toppings (including sauce), cold American cheese, cold bun...I've never had a good one here, and the fries taste as though they're cooked in old oil. Way too salty.   Literally the only two things I like to get are the BLT, which is miraculously executed well, and the banana cinnamon shake, which is admittedly my favorite shake anywhere, ever. If you're willing to drop a few more bucks, go elsewhere before it's too late.

Noooooo I'm tired of all these boring neighborhood bars in Glendale. You can afford to add something other than budmillercoors on tap. Do something cool. Step into the 2010s. Like, *at least* Four Peaks could be useful here. I feel the same way about going to Hooper's as I would going on a date with someone who starts their day with a PSL and a Meghan Trainor album. Basic as fuck, I want no part of it.   Bartender was nice, but I don't trust anyone at a place like this to mix more than two ingredients. So I went with something simple--Red Stag and coke. The coke was flat. Whatever, let's check out what's going on with the jukebox...which was apparently not connecting with the internet. OK OK, it was becoming comically bad. At least it's got a patio, even if it is incredibly narrow.   Overall, this is the kind of bar you only go to for convenience and not because it's cool. The west valley overall is raising the bar for a good dive, and I hope Hooper's can recognize that and catch up. Two stars for being clean, polite, and having a respectable liquor selection, but there ain't much else.

"In honor of Colorado and Washington, the fourth quarter special will be liquid marijuana for $4.20"   I picked the right place to watch the super bowl.   This bar is off the beaten path. You can drive up and down Glendale all day and not notice it unless you're using a GPS. Once you get there, you'll see it's HUGE! And retro. Like, my dad probably came here at my age. It's that old.   The decor is legit, with so much sports memorabilia you look through. They have decades old helmets from seemingly every college team in the game. There's a baseball room as well. This place almost doubles as a museum!  All the drinks are cheap, and there's a full menu of just about anything you could want. It's nothing gourmet, just old-fashioned bar food. TVs aren't the best quality, but they are everywhere, so you can watch whatever you want. Glendale gets pretty boring, so I'm really glad to find this place to break the monotony.

In a land where I can get a burrito just a hop, skip, and a jump from any corner, I don't understand how this place still exists. It's a little hut that looks pretty run down, but I never judge a book by its cover when I eat, so that doesn't bother me. I went through the drive through, and was greeted with only silence.   When my friend and I turned the corner to leave, we noticed that the place was not closed (Come on, this was like 4 PM), and that the staff was having a conversation. Much to my chagrin, my friend used his persistence to force an answer at the window. Met with obvious displeasure, it was clear they had better things to do than serve us. We ordered some simple carne asada burritos, went home, and I prepared to have a nice lunch.  I received nothing of the sort. I don't demand that my asada be grilled, but when it's stewed, it better be stewed in some amazing spices. This certainly was not. Every other bite greeted me with either gristle or chunks of fat. It was all bland, and their watered-down salsas did nothing to alleviate the torture I put my taste buds through.   Terrible service, terrible food. Never again.

Made it too late for the dinner, but at prime time for the party!  Came here with a charming paisita for a night out in a new place. All the music was in Spanish, and I can get down on some Norteno when I'm downing $4 pints of Pacifico or Negra Modelo. The margaritas were pre-made, but totally worth it, on the rocks OR frozen.  The bartenders rocked, and were more than happy to concoct "something girly" to sip on. Also, personable, as was everyone else--not one patron was having a bad time. Dance floor was PACKED. But then a lit up corner in the back with some billiards if that's your style.  Will definitely be back for the food, but for a night club, La Perla was a small culture shock for me, but still kicked all sorts of ass.

I appreciate the charm of local diners, but with my picky palate, it's going to take more than the minimalist, dive-y approach to win this stomach over. Service is brisk and polite, with a waitress ready to top off your coffee before you can muster your last gulp. Food comes quickly, with a smile, as you gaze onto the barren, yet bustling intersection of 59th & Northern. It's almost like having breakfast in someone's home, and in my head I imagined some charming, old time music that would be fitting for Parsons' antiquated coziness.   In my head, the record skipped once I saw the food. Something so simple as a BLT should never ever be a problem, but they managed to thoroughly burn my bacon, leaving it almost blackened and rock hard. As I bit into it desperately, water from freshly washed lettuce trickled on to my plate.   But with hunger as the best spice, I did not give up so easily as I sampled my friend's chili cheese omelet. Just canned chili on eggs, with not the slightest pretense of effort. No signature touch. No sort of unique taste to call their own. I'm not asking for anything gourmet, but merely just a step above something I would neglectfully concoct in my own kitchen while struggling with a hangover. I like simple diner food. I don't like diner food that refuses to try.

You can either pay $8 at Panda Express for the same old BS, or you can go out of your way to a place like Big Heng and get a crab puff (and oh, their crab puffs are amazing), an egg roll (hell, all their appetizers are freaking good), chicken chow mein, fried shrimp, AND sweet and sour pork. All on one plate. I DARE you to finish a full meal here, because *I* can't, and I'm pretty good at eating.  You will never hear me say Big Heng has the highest quality entrees, but you will hear me say it's good enough, and they give you so much, with a smile, that it's worth it every time.  Seriously, just look at their menu and tell me you can't find something you like.  Thank me later.  PS-If you dine in, get the plum wine!

A dive located awkwardly behind McDonald's, Enoch's is a cozy little place to have a few. The selection was a bit limited, I don't think the bartender knew any of the mixed drinks advertised at the table, and a near-senior crowd will try their darned hardest at karaoke.  As for bar appetizers, I saw lots of microwaved popcorn. Strange. I ordered a beer (thank you for freezing your mugs!), sat down, and had a long pondering about how to describe this bar.  It's like a small get together at a friend of a friend's house. The people are very nice, but it's boring and they're in no hurry to get to know you. Meh.

This is a dive I can see myself frequenting. The crowd it attracts is above average for the region; the guys put my billiards skill to shame, and the women are under 40. Thursday nights are karaoke, and I was told there's a Nintendo Wii available, probably for people like me that don't want to get embarrassed at pool.  The appetizers are cheap and creative. How many dives serve breakfast junk food, like french toast sticks, or sausage wrapped in a blueberry pancake? A friend and I split the fried cheesecake bites, and they were comparable to the kind of junk food you can find at the fair. Yum.  The prices on booze are cheap, too. $2 vodka u-call-its on Sunday night. $3.25 for your choice of some interesting bottles, including Heineken dark lager (I didn't even know this existed) and Wyder's Pear Cider, which I was more than happy to down.  A nice perk I observed was a room full of six packs in the corner. Apparently, it's to buy yourself some beers to take home when you're not ready for the night to end. Cheap junk food, cheap booze, and good people. What else do you want from a dive?

Ever feel like people are dummies for NOT consulting Yelp? I often get into tiffs with my friends about which restaurants NOT to go to. I saw the sparse, lackluster views (especially from Iain B!) and said "I think this is a bad idea. Are you SURE?"...damn it, they just had to be.  This food is just as boring as the neighborhood. It looked well-kept enough, but was uncomfortably quiet. The menu was expansive, but I remained healthily skeptical about what and what not to order. While we waited, we were greeted with water and hot tea...  "Sun Devil" chicken/pork/beef sounded tasty, but I knew to call bullshit when it said "extremely spicy". So I settled for my staple at new Chinese restaurants: Lemon chicken. Why such an overdone dish? Because it tells me if they know how to make a chicken breast, the easiest meat to prepare, and they know how to make a sauce. They failed on both counts.  Sure, the chicken was cooked properly, but there was no detectable flavor in the meat itself OR the batter. It was sitting in a pool of a lemon syrup that didn't suit it at all. No hint of fresh lemons anywhere; it tasted like one half of a lemon meringue pie. It was WAY too sweet. My friend's Sun Devil pork came out, and I declined to try it. It was essentially chopped pork with plentiful diced jalapenos. What a snooze.   Chang Lee is full of mediocre, uninspiring food that lacks quality, is overpriced, and no sides other than a smidgen of white rice (No wontons? Egg rolls, even!?). I really don't have a reason to return.

I heard this is a recruiting station for those homely American Apparel models. I heard they charge a cover if you don't bring a Mac.  All clientele jokes aside, this really is a place where an average Joe like myself can grab, well, an above-average cup of Joe. And more. This place has some apparently good eats, baked goods (some of which are vegan!), amazing teas, and a groovy beer selection.  I opted for an "Earl Greyer", because good black tea owns. This stuff was dank! The barista took the tiny pouch out of a can, and I could smell the bergamot from pretty far away. "Let it steep" he said, giving me about five minutes to scour Lux for this review. Here are some observations:  -I have excellent vision, but the menus printed on two windows were admittedly a pain to read. Sure you don't want to have some in print?  -The area to order and the area to wait seemed to be the same place. There is no clear line, but more of an amorphous bunch of people eager for service.  -The layout appears to encourage openness. Too bad most people are too busy typing away to enjoy what could really be a bustling social scene. Come on, there's amazing goodies, great music (I swear I heard some Band of Horses), and a bar. Live it up a little people!  -While the cooks were having a great time, I don't think my barista cracked a smile at any point. You have a great job. Enjoy it!   Overall, I just have some minor beef with Lux's interior. A haphazard design that can easily confuse newcomers appears to be an avenue of pretentiousness rather than a chance to showcase aesthetics.   But I'll stop nitpicking, I like this place a lot. Can't wait to try more!

It's hard to be a record store when most of us can just download what we want with a credit card and a few swipes on our smartphone. This is why Zia's newest location brings more cool merch than ever.   Used DVDs: Around $4 each, and a very good selection of movies you might have missed 5-10 years ago.   Video Games: For classic and current consoles. The selection *is* a bit weak for PS3, however, but you might find great deals on the used selection.   Vinyl: Very large aisle. I totally approve.   Misc: Customizable T-Shirts pressed in-store!? Oh gosh, I can't wait to come back and use it. Looks awesome!  Okay, the music selection isn't that shabby. I can't think of any bands that I wasn't able to find. They even had more obscure indie bands like Winter Gloves. I fully trust they know what they're doing.   Of course, expect the usual awkward security experience...bags get handed to you at the door, and some 140-lb kid in an oversized security outfit will glare everyone down.

The ability to get mediocre Chinese AND Mexican food at the same time amounts to a whole experience much greater than the sum of its parts. Never has foreign cuisine been bastardized so effectively...but it works.  Think of it as a Panda Express and Taco Bell sharing the same building, only they're totally down to mix up items. You want machaca over fried rice? Sure. Terriyaki chicken quesadilla? Not even a problem. The goal is to satisfy both cravings for $10, and I don't think that can be done anywhere else.   I prefer to uh...keep my food separated, with a rice bowl and a small quesadilla. "You could have saved money by making it a combo!" they said as my food was brought. Too bad no one pointed that out as I handed in the multiple choice test that was my order. I came here to eat, not to fill out paperwork!  Diners rave about the Jade Chicken, and I don't think it's half bad. It's taste is vaguely orange and is a tad on the oily side, and looks and tastes like sweet and sour cut with buffalo sauce...which is weird, but works. Top it off with a bite-sized cheese crisp, a cookie, and perhaps even a reasonably-priced craft beer!   On your way out, feel free to grab one of the mock Chinese T-Shirts...it's politically correct, but when the rest of the decor looks decades old, I at least appreciate the antiquity of the establishment as a whole. It excels in nothing. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Each item alone is just a-ok. It's the sheer variety and speed of service that forces me to rate it so highly with an extra star.

So back in the 19th century, a bunch of Catholic dudes were the OG hipsters, all up in SE Asia's business (before America made it cool) to establish "French Indochina". They said something along the lines of "This Viet food is delicious, but it'd go better inside le baguette!"   And here we are in the year 2015, where I can order delicious banh mi, that is, some decent bread with fresh pickled onions/carrots and a little grilled pork. If one would like to be an absolute wuss, they can go with some European cold-cut sandwich with ham or something. I enjoyed my #5 even if at times I thought I was biting into just bread. For less than $8, I washed it down with a very refreshing avocado smoothie. Next time, I've gotta try the sugar cane juice! Or all the groovy baked goods they've got in the little shop by the register.   Imperialism never tasted so good.   PS-Cash or GTFO

**tl;dr--they make a great burger, but that's probably about it. **  At this point, it really goes without saying that the FEZ Burger is one of the best you can find in this town. If FEZ were just a burger place, I'd end my review with five stars and tell them to just take my money when lunch time rolls around. At $11, and $14 with fries (since when are fries a premium, and not the default side dish?) it's pricey, but you are getting good quality.  But FEZ is more than just a burger joint, and the further it strays from what it does right, the more disappointment I was afflicted with. "New American" as it's often called, is a genre of food that borrows a foreign cuisine and makes it friendly to your unadventurous palates. Here, the motif is northern Africa, where you can sample the flavors of "kisra" and harissa.   The "super spicy" hummus looked course enough to warrant high expectations. It just *looks* so fresh and house-made that I couldn't wait to dig in. I know spice gets toned down for American food, but I really expected it to mean more than mild flavoring and tons of salt. The herbs in the flatbread were not compatible with the hummus in any way, but generous slices of cucumber somehow saved it from being a total disaster.  My honeydew margarita tasted like...well, a regular margarita. I'm not so sure they remembered to add anything to it. It was just alright. I understand they specialize in martinis, but that doesn't mean you get to slack on the rest!  Sweet potato fries were overrated! Half way through, I noticed the faint crunch from the tons of added sugar that was just dumped on. It was definitely overkill, and the sweet dipping sauce didn't help. I will not order these again.  Atmosphere was vaguely modern, but still bland. If you want to boast music as part of it, stop blasting radio-safe hits from 15 years ago and get with a cool, up-to-date playlist. Service felt rushed, but I'd rather have it be swift than slow. Management does well, but a kitchen that tries to do too much leaves much to be desired.

Three words: Legit Irish pub.  None of this nonsense where they place Guinness ads everywhere and make vague references to Dublin on some sign. But a great bar, with a wall of whiskey and the best British beers. Seriously, almost every whiskey I can think of is on their shelf, and all YOU have to do is decide if you're hardcore enough for straight shots or car bombs. With a coke, you say? Wuss.  Anyways, I saw some people ordering food (I was just here to drink) and it looked pretty good. I'll be back!

Unique, QUALITY eats at reasonable prices, along with good staff and a great bar.  I was immediately drawn to the shelf of wine bottles at the bar. Tons of stuff I haven't seen in other surrounding establishments, available by the glass. Since I was feeling like a wuss, I ordered the sangria. Turned out ordering a sangria is pretty manly, as this packed a wallop. I had to sip on it with the amazing snack I had...apples, heated brie, walnuts, raisins, all on some toasty bread I'm too gauche to spell correctly. Ooh! Let's not forget the sweet onion relish. It was a little bit cumbersome trying to eat a stack of these ingredients, but it was totally worth it when all the flavors came together.  This is like the third or fourth time I've been here. All others were during First Friday, and it had a dive bar feel then. I like.

No freaking clue why Zuma was so packed on a Tuesday when so many superior bars were open, but maybe they're just doing something right.  Or maybe the loudest bar wins Mill Ave? Super loud music doesn't bother me, but this was Front-row-at-a-rock-concert loud. Seriously, like I-have-to-yell-in-the-bartender's-ear loud. A notch below that is where you want to be, thank you.  So anyway, you know the bartenders are no good when you order 3 of the same drink, and they all have drastically different amounts of liquor in them. Get that shit on point. Also, why do you have the Guinness tap up, only to pop open a CAN when I order one? GTFO with that.   The layout isn't crowd-friendly, and I saw quite a significantly older men cruising around trying too hard to fit in. I'm not your "bro" and I call it "increased efficiency", not "double fisting". Nothing about Zuma strikes me as special...well except for whoever does their marketing. They totally deserve a raise for making such a mediocre spot so popular.

It had been a while since I'd visited a REAL bakery, so this seemed like a prime choice for First Friday. The pastries were simply beautiful, although most of them looked too sweet for my taste. Cupcakes like red velvet smothered in buttercream? I can't handle that, but you'll probably love it. I opted for a simple blueberry-sour cream muffin, and one of MJs cookies. At $1 each, and $3.25 per cupcake, make sure your sweet tooth doesn't drain your wallet. Part of me wants to complain about the price ($12 for a dozen tiny cookies just doesn't fly!), it WAS the best cookie I've had in years.   I'll be back to try some of their fresh loafs of bread. They also make some deli sandwiches. Those seem like they'll be high quality, and a better value.

I love when I get brave enough to try new cuisines, and then they turn out amazing. Little Saigon, a little house I've overlooked for years, delivers in flavor, value, and probably nutrition.   The vegetables are that good.   I started off with my very first banh xeo, a crunchy crepe filled with bean sprouts and some shrimp. Unlike French crepes that you can simply dig into, this dish will crumble as soon as you touch it. Use it as filling for a lettuce wrap, and if you're quirky like myself, enjoy the liberal portions of fresh mint and carrots that come along with it. It's still weird to me, but I'd eat it again.   My main course was some beef over bok choi, which was prepared perfectly. I have never had bok choi this tasty, and I'd definitely recommend it. I think it's the number 57, which shows you how many options they have.   For dessert, I went with a taro boba. It was way sweeter than I'm used to...but hey, it's a dessert, so what could I expect? Overall, I was satisfied with a very affordable meal in a clean, stylish environment. I would totes come back.

Coolest place I've ever stumbled into. In less than five minutes, I had a beer in hand and was fist pumping to a Queen sing-a-long with a rowdy crowd. There was ample room to sit or stand, and I'm convinced Big Bang is a great bar for any audience.  I would take a date here. I would take my parents here. I would take the guys here. I would even go here for a company/team meeting.  Someone who doesn't drink would even have fun. Anyone between the ages of 21 and 100 needs to get underground for guaranteed good times!

So far, I can only review the bar for this place, but that's all one needs to be sold on Haus Murphy's. Virtually anything and everything I could think of was stocked in the dense cabinets, and the tap selection was amazing. Amazing, I tell you! Now, I've never had German beer, but my Dunkel Optimiser hit the spot and packed quite a punch. Would drink again, especially since you can get it as a 32. oz. Are you up to that challenge?  Of course, the overall atmosphere also rocks. I've walked by here a million times and seen the live polka and such. Consider this a place a glimpse of a culture you won't see too often around these parts. Can't wait to tell you about the food!

In my opinion, it needs to be a bit more lively. Still though, this does everything you'd expect for a historic district. You'll find what is perhaps the highest quality AND quantity of antiques on one block. Housed in buildings that have stood much longer than you or I. In what has only recently become a booming metropolis, what is old is certainly rare.   It has some decent dining options. I feel the Subway is out of place, and needs to GTFO, but you've got one of the best pizza places in the state (La Piazza), one of the only places for German (Haus Murphy's), as well as a Lenny's. Let's not forget La Perla, which moonlights as a fun Latin nightclub. For coffee, you've got above average cafes in Mighty Cup and A Shot of Java, where you can catch tons of live, local music.   Bars do leave much to be desired, however. Perhaps they're discouraged by the local police precinct, but I think it could really shine if hip new locales like OTG Wine & Beer were open later. In the future, I think we'll see even better dining and drinking options, but for now this place is like an Oasis in a portion of desert with very few attractions. If only it were as good year round as it is in winter.

If you've been shopping somewhere like Bath and Body Works, you need to wake up and smell the roses. Lush is without a doubt THE best store for lotion, soap, and well, cosmetics.  It's winter and my hands are dry? They have something for that. It's summer and I'm feeling a little icky? There's tons of stuff for that, too.  This place smells like heaven, and I think every employee is high from the flower fumes, because they have more energy than a toddler with a sippy cup of Red Bull. Most of the products are completely natural, with tons of vegan options. I find something useful EVERY time I visit!  Even the most macho gentlemen should feel no shame shopping here. Ladies love a man with good skin!

Oh my, what a depressing experience.  First of all, even a year ago I would have given this place 3 stars. I'm not one of you jaded Yelpers that is reluctant to venture northwest of Scottsdale & Camelback, and unlike most people who reviews malls in the west side, don't crap my pants when I see a few kids with their pants sagging. Get some culture.  Anyways, this was a depressing experience. I just wanted to get a pair of jeans, but there was nothing good in either of the two stores that sold them--American Eagle and Aeropostale had no good deals. Every shopping experience was a pain, including:  -Hot Topic not carrying the one album I'd actually buy from a Hot Topic  -Silver Effects being a ripoff. $21 for earrings that I can buy for much, much cheaper. It's buy one get one half off, but the next size of them (gauges) were $17 *each*, and the sales rep admitted that it made the deal pointless. She was pretty cool, but obviously didn't care about her job.  -The Sprint store is not full service, just sales. That's to be expected in a mall, I guess.  I'm just really irked because everything about this place was frustrating and depressing. It's so bad that literally half the stores and kiosks are closed. It's so bad that those teenage thug wannabes don't even try to sell their CDs, and no one waits at the transit station because few buses run through.  Even the food court was half empty, with the only place open being ran by some stoned-looking teenagers who weren't even trying. While eating, I spied the CCTV display in the food court. Classy.   I'll stop ranting. This place is dead. It has potential though--Lombardo's gelato is back, and if it's the same stuff as always, it's the best gelato I've had in town. Hopefully it can be saved by businesses looking for a cheap startup.

tl;dr--This is the natural progression of shopping and nightlife when you're too old to dress like/sleep with ASU undergrads on Mill. It's the poor man's Los Angeles with a wild wild west flair. It's where you go to flex (that means show off), and the hotspot for the most extravagant nightlife you'll find in the state. Have fun.

One of the best places to spend a summer night in Arizona.  Not the biggest beer selection I've seen, but for a such a small, independent place I'm absolutely impressed. Even more so when everything is bottled and not on tap. There's everything from Framboise Lambic if you're a girly girl to Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA if you're a masochist (kidding, I know some of you beer "experts" love the stuff).  On the opposite side of the bar, I was treated to some generous beer tasting that expanded my horizons. The people running this bar are kind and unassuming, even though the art/craft beer/music gives them a license to be pretentious. The live bands are a treat, and something I look forward to on my next visit, something Lost Leaf has undoubtedly earned.

4 years and 60+ visits later, it's time to rave about this place a little more. It gets five stars. It is easily one of the best bars in Phoenix, and the best example of how to make the most of a very small space.   The setup itself is totally legit...a few tables in front of a bar in the corner, a stage, and an awesome little patio nestled in between the old house and Jobot.   The beer selection is on point, and has improved over the years in two aspects: Rotating seasonal brews, and the installment of local brews on draft. My go-to is the Lumberyard Red, but unlike my 21-year-old self I freaking love the IPAs, and they usually have them. The wine selection is also small, but good. Get the Malbec...or the sake. It's like $15 (for the bottle! Wow! I'd pay more!) and by far the best way to get sloshed. In style.   If you're being cheap--or just want something light to cap a night of binging--there's always $2 PBR. Groovy.   It's about more than just drinking, of course. They make an effort to have at least one live set EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. That cannot be beat. Jam out while you check out the local art for sale.   In the end, I've gotta say this is tied for my favorite bar around. I have never had a bad time here, and if you're not sure where to go, The Lost Leaf is a sure bet.

More underwhelming sushi from the west valley. I have friends that swear this place has some of the best, and I'm just not seeing it. Nothing on the specialty roll menu was special.   Unagi nigiri-surprisingly scorching when it arrived. It also tasted off, like it was old and reheated.   The '21 roll'-Standard tempura with eel sauce and spicy mayo that you can find anywhere. It has four or five different fish in it, but it's not like they really shine. Admittedly tasty.  007 roll-Avocado and shrimp on top, spicy krab filler. Nothing mind blowing. Very watery for a roll of its kind. Questionable.  Takamatsu charges decent sushi prices while delivering sushi that just ain't up to snuff. I promised myself not to review this place until I tried the Korean BBQ side that most people come for, but I can't wait that long. Friends don't let friends eat bad sushi.

This is easily some of the worst service I've received. Anywhere. Ever. I didn't even come here to eat, I just came for a little get-together that involved a group of 15-20 people, a karaoke room, and lots of sake bombs.   Okay, maybe just A sake bomb. Mostly because it took forever to talk to anyone! There is a bar area that's separate from restaurant seating, but even though there was certainly the demand for a bartender, there was no one designated to take care of a counter with tons of traffic. In between serving tables, someone would come by really fast and take an order. It took nearly 40 minutes and several attempts to get someone's attention to be served.   If I weren't there with really cool people, I would just rage quit, leave, and never come to this establishment again.   After my order was placed, they fumbled around catering to the karaoke rooms, which understandably had priority, even at my expense. They ran out of the beer they'd normally use. They ran out of glasses and had to wash more. These poor young women were really busting their butts, and they were really nice. I don't blame them, they definitely needed one more person, and management that knows how to direct what were obviously some first-timers to the restaurant/bar industry.   My sake bomb was great considering it was only $5. It was huge! Came with a 20 oz. bottle. The karaoke room was fun. I've never been to one before, but if they're all like that...flashing lights, no noise pollution, and ample seating...then I've gotta check out some more.   What's also cool is that they serve food really late. Like, you can order til like 1:30, which seems unheard of for an authentic Korean establishment.   It seems like there are definitely some growing pains here. People definitely love this place, but staff have WAY too much trouble keeping up. Virtually all the credit for enjoying my time here can be attributed to my pals. I will be back some time in a smaller group, but I'll wait a little while for them to figure out what they're doing.

You know you're broke when you even think about eating this. Marinara sauce tastes like it's cut with salsa, and the pizza crust tastes like it was brushed in margarine. Questionable all around, but it's even CHEAPER than Little Caesar's, so do you really have a right to complain?

Eh...screw this place. Anyone who shops at Gamestop knows they suck, with the way they constantly pester you for subscriptions and (usually) charge ridiculous amounts for used or old games. Overall, the franchise gets 3 stars from me overall, but this one gets less for crappy customer service.  I had finally found a certain used game I was looking for, and when I had a chance to sit down and play it, it would not work. They have a seven day return policy, and on the seventh day I was able to show up and address the issue.  They didn't have any more copies of the same game (which they would normally switch out--no questions asked), and would not let me exchange it for the same game on another system, even though the 360 version costs LESS. What kind of store won't let you exchange for a cheaper product?  In any case, I found myself at an impasse with someone clueless in regard to customer service. I was told to make a stop at their next store a few miles away, but it just wasn't worth it. I don't think I'll be shopping at this location anymore.

I never remember Costco having this awesome of an alcohol selection. All the other stuff is as awesome as you'll find in any other location, but you should know me well enough to see which direction this review is headed in.   If I'm throwing a party where quantity is more important than quality, they've got me covered. My jaw freaking dropped at the sight of 6 bottles of Beringer for $18. I was in disbelief at the low, low prices for handles of typical party swill like Fireball. As I stood there in amazement, the representative was eager to watch me toss boxes of goods into the cart.   Only regret was having jager as bulk only. $90 for six bottles and an ice chest. That's an awesome deal, but I'm not crashing an ASU party, so that's overdoing it. Even for me.

Just when I thought I was sick of pizza, I ended up at Barro's. I've never seen such a squadron of youngsters so friendly and helpful. When they say "20 minutes", my pizza's ready in 15. These kids are on the ball.  The crust? Not too thin, not too thick. Just right. Tasty. Soft. Sauce? Great! Not too thin, just the right amount, not too salty or tangy. Great cheese, generous toppings. My mouth is watering. So many specialties I have to try...I wonder about that kona pizza with terryaki sauce, chicken, and pineapple. Sounds yummy.  It's also nice that they're always doing some sort of fundraiser in there; they really enjoy giving to the community. This is not your average parlor.

Hey look, it's a hotel near the I-17 with friendly customer service, and no tweekers or prostitutes. Ya don't see that every day. Lovely place to crash with friends when you're too wobbly to drive home. Good value, spacious, clean rooms, above average breakfast. Would recommend.

PROTIP: Never talk down to customers, you don't know if they Yelp. =)  Recently, a friend and I made a stop here to purchase a modest amount of alcohol. Business as usual--until we were forced to wait at checkout for about five minutes. After losing my patience, I observed what was happening. The cashier had taken our IDs to two other clerks, who inspected them thoroughly. Keep in mind that my card is genuine, valid, and with a small amount of wear. The lamination is intact, and all information is legible.  It is good enough for dozens of bars, liquor stores (including chains such as Total Wine), and every other grocery store I have been to...so why such scrutiny now? Our clueless clerk, who seemed just a bit too eager and upbeat to address or inconvenience, was more than happy to answer with a smile.  "Okay, we were concerned about these IDs being fake", she explained, citing an incident from earlier that day. "We had to decide whether or not to accept these". Her concern felt rather malevolent. As she reluctantly allowed me to finish my transaction, she had some final words as I took my receipt.  "ESPECIALLY yours. We almost denied it. You really need a new one."  Had I not been with friends and had places to be, I would have asked to speak with a manager about such disappointing customer service. Clearly, they were the mistaken ones in regard to the validity of my ID. Would it not make sense to...apologize for being wrong and holding me up? At the very least, she could have briefly explained their policy on verifying age. Otherwise, it feels very accusatory and arbitrary. Minus one star for the hold up, one for having a meager selection compared to other Fry's, and minus infinity stars for condescending clerks that try to lecture me. I'll try my best to avoid this location.

Rosati's is the closest I can get to authentic Chicago pizza, so with locations disappearing left and right I didn't mind going out of my way to stop here. It was under new management, and staffed by some teenagers. The server was new, and it was quite possibly her first job ever, so I'll try my best to be forgiving!  "We're just really backed up, yours will be ready soon!"  Having like two take out orders and one other table isn't THAT bad. My apps took almost as long as the pizza to come out. Over 20 minutes for mozzarella sticks? Get real! I got the deep dish to go, and was sorely disappointed to see the bottom was burned.   I would totally give this place another chance, but not until they get a real manager who gets it together! The young staff totally has the personality and talent for customer service, and I hope that soon this location can shine. Seriously, I don't want any more of these shutting down.

Picture your average ----berto's but with a beer and a salsa bar.  No scratch that, at least those places put some effort into your food. Got the biggest burrito they had "huge burrito? Buritto Tote? Something like that. Just barely warm. Adobado had decent flavoring but was masked by ample lettuce and cold, shredded cheddar. Recommended red salsa tasted like paprika and liquid smoke.  They have some groovy options here, no doubt. Their tortillas are obviously above average, but what goes inside of them is disappointing. If you have the patience to find out what does and doesn't work in lieu of a dozen options nearby, get at me and I'll reconsider.

Everyone in AZ has been to Filiberto's, and if you've expanded your horizons you'll realize it's nothing special.   But who cares? This is Sun Devil turf. You're drunk, and there's a pretty cool crowd of fellow youngsters looking to scarf down some cheap food and pass out. Socialize while you wait a half hour for your order. When you feel like crap in the morning, just chalk it up to the four loko and forget about indulging in this embarrassment to Mexican food.  Two stars because those poor guys work so hard. Not that this review matters--they'll get plenty of business.

Not really a seafood kind of guy. I'm on the record saying once you cook seafood, it's ruined!  I'll shut up now, thanks to Las Islas.   First of all, I must say the prices are VERY affordable. $3 beers and full plates that will leave you stuffed for as low as 8 bucks.   My chimi was gargantuan and very enjoyable...there's no way I could finish this whole thing AND all the sides it came with. I love the beans!  The ceviche tostadas were sweeter than I expected, but they were LOADED and pretty good.   I had bite of my friend's fish, featured in my photos. Very savory, tons of garlic, thoroughly delicious.   The atmosphere is also very good. There's a sort of a lounge in the back with the pool table, and lots of live music. You will feel welcomed and you will have fun, especially if you are hanging out with paisas. B-)   I don't have seafood cravings often, but this is a good place to satisfy them. Just keep in mind that if you don't like seafood, it's cool that there's plenty of stuff without it. What's not cool, however, is that it's all prepped in the same place, and your meal is probably going to taste fishy no matter what. Although I enjoyed my chimi, it was very obviously fried in the same oil as everything else! Minus one star! But other than that, this place is solid.

Place your order, take a nap, and prepare to be underwhelmed. Chicago Gyros is what happens when you value quantity over quality.   The menu is huge. That's totally cool when you're generally using the same ingredients again and again. But wait--they're getting a bit too ambitious. Greek burgers with feta and hummus? Philly cheese steaks? Please, you're trying too hard! Naturally I ordered the gyro, because there's no hope for you if you mess that up.  The wait times are looooong. It's not like I had my stopwatch with me, but this is definitely more time than one should wait for simple Greek food. It hovered around 20 minutes. And we (total of 3) were the only ones there. Don't get me wrong--I'm not too impatient when I'm dining somewhere for the first time. I like to assume someone's in the back eagerly carving the roast to impress a new customer. Call me spoiled.   When I received the gyro, it was STUFFED. No way was I going to finish that AND the fries (which weren't good). But the meat was just mediocre. It was the most bland gyro I've had, as if the filling were carved in advance and cooked through some unorthodox method. Or maybe the seasoning is just off. I left stuffed, but couldn't shake the feeling that I wasted calories. I only get 3,000 a day! I have to spend them wisely!  If it comes between Chicago Gyros and more mainstream options for fast-casual dining, I'd give it a second chance. But if it's between this and other Greek kitchen, I wouldn't give other places a second thought.

Why do so many people think this is a good franchise? These are the most bland, disappointing burgers I've ever had from any chain. Let me document the three tries I've given it.  Strike 1-Burger with Swiss cheese, cheddar cheese, sauteed mushrooms and bacon. Sounds like an amazing burger, but it was just bland and greasy.  Strike 2-Bleu Ribbon burger with onion straws, blue cheese, and steak sauce. I didn't know anything with blue cheese on it could still be so boring. Yawn.  Strike 3-A vegetarian quesadilla and guacamole bacon burger. The quesadilla looked awesome, stuffed with mushrooms and whatnot, but I had to dip it in guac to give my tastebuds the slightest hint of satisfaction. They should stop using cheap, mild cheese and maybe actually season the stuff instead of giving your 4 different toppings for it. Also, the burger sucked. It doesn't matter if it says "Oregano seasoned patty" or "cayenne" or whatever--they all taste the same. Not to mention telling the waitress "well done" and getting meat with plenty of pink.  I want to give you 1 star so bad, but you try to be good, especially with the vegetarian substitutions available. I hope your patrons wake up and realize there are exponentially better burgers in several locations within walking distance.

tl;dr--Management sucks at event planning, and hires police to enforce store policies, which were only reiterated correctly if store policy is "f*** you".  This is a review of this particular store's ability to function during Black Frid...er...Thanksgiving, a.k.a. the worst shopping experience I've ever seen, even compared to other Black Friday madness.   Okay, so doors are open all day, but no one is allowed to have anything discounted until 6pm, in which sales are conducted in intervals of two hours. This is obviously bullshit, but it's not unique to this store, so I'm not giving them one star for that.   Fine print on ads reads that tickets may be given out in advance to shoppers who get there early to wait. However, this is at the management's discretion, and staff wouldn't disclose whether or not they'd participate. Additionally, they pick and choose which items to give out tickets for. This is dumb.   So here's what really grinds my gears:  -The Black Friday map was inaccurate. While it says "laptops here", only half of them were in that actual location. The other half were on the other side of the store, with no way to figure it out without stumbling upon it.   -Police were getting aggressive with shoppers, blatantly misinterpreting store policy. "If you don't have a ticket, you can't get this item! Leave!" They straight up yelled at someone to get away for no reason, even though there were coupons shoppers could pick up to pay for their item now and have it shipped later. I cannot stress enough how terrible it is to be intimidated by law enforcement for doing nothing wrong.   -When picking up a voucher, shoppers have to pay for the item at the cashier, and have it shipped later. That's awesome for people who don't like to literally camp in parking lots. However, management CHOSE to open up ONLY TWO registers for these vouchers, forcing what looked like 80% of the traffic into two lines that easily took 90 minutes. My friends took their vouchers to a different location to avoid this crap.   This used to be my go-to spot for busy holiday shopping. It felt like a location not a lot of people went to for more expensive items. NEVER. AGAIN.

Are you not entertained? This is pretty much a playground for adults.   No way you can come here and not find something you like. Yeah, I get it, there are tons of chain restaurants...but come on, when have you been so picky that you can't eat wings...or Yard House...or Tex-Mex.   Actually, scratch that, don't get any of the Tex-Mex available here. In fact, don't eat ANYWHERE that doubles as a club late at night. But do drink in those places. Go barhopping because you can find any liquor, any beer, or any genre of music.   Most places here don't stick out to me. On their own, only 2-3 establishments break the four-star barrier. However, all the options transform into a giant gathering area greater than the sum of its parts.   Oh, and there's the sports teams and the movie theater. This rivals Bell Road for coolest place in the West Valley, and makes a good reprieve from other nightlife hotspots like Scottsdale and Roosevelt.

Oi! Dust off your leather jackets, find some boots or chucks, and grab a Rancid T-Shirt, because this dive bar is punk!  Well, not *that* punk. I'll settle down now. Rogue west is a cozy little place with style. Everything is black and red and awesome. Lord knows why some 1970s porn was on the screen, but at least it made for good conversation.  The bartender is laid back and friendly, and the drinks are a reasonable price. I'm bumping this place up to four stars because it's also a music venue of sorts. Jager and mosh pits, anyone?

The Mighty Cup: Making 'old town' Glendale less boring one open mic night at a time. I've always enjoyed seeing some acoustic, or even stand up comedy while I sip on a late-night latte.  The coffee itself is decent, and the motif here is--you guessed it, a "mighty" sized beverage to keep you buzzed all night. There's a wide variety, and you can compliment your drink with a small menu of cakes, pastries, or hot sandwiches.  The look of the place is...well, antique. It's an old house. Nothing fancy. Everything artsy. If you're trying to rebel against mainstream coffee, this is a great place to start.

Koi is decent sushi with a bit of variety, and something I enjoy often.  Just don't go to this location! There's a mandatory gratuity, so the staff loves to be slow, and rude. Good luck on getting your drinks refilled, or even seeing that snappy old lady in a kimono crack a smile!  I cannot emphasize enough that everyone who works here is a ****ing jerk. They seem to get away with it because there aren't really any other sushi bars in the area. I don't care that I have to travel almost ten miles to eat at another Koi, I'm never going to this place again!  And neither should you.

Lenny's is a great regional chain you should consider in lieu of places like Five Guys and Smashburger. Fries are thick-cut with seasoned salt, beer-battered onion rings are perfect, and the 50s music in this location might drive you crazy.   Every Lenny's seems to be a little bit different, but they all do the same things well. I love the banana shakes, and the BLT sandwiches. Here, it's a ranch BLT with sourdough. It sounds like messing with perfection but is worth a try.   You can get a burger on just about every block in this town. Why not show a little love for your home by keeping it local?

If I had to choose between sex and another visit to Yucca Tap, women everywhere would be bracing themselves for disappointment.  While many bars aim to boast the LARGEST beer selection, Yucca keeps it cool, with a nice ratio of staples like PBR and Red Stripe for $3 to obscure drafts for as low as $6. Many of them come in 10-12 oz. glasses, and that's so they don't completely kick your ass. I had:  Deschutes Hop Henge Experimental IPA (8.5% ABV) Mission Shipwrecked Double IPA (9.3%) And some other ale from Goose Island Brewery I was too buzzed to bother noting details on.   Also, the liquor selection. Just do it.  You don't even have to drink to enjoy this place. There's a good bar menu, a Foosball table, pool, some casino game I don't recognize, and A WHOLE OTHER BAR FOR MORE LIQUOR AND LIVE MUSIC. And they don't even charge a cover.  Just writing this review makes me wanna race out there right now, and it takes a lot to get this excited about a dive.

Just about everything I want in a sports bar!  -A VERY comfortable viewing experience.   -Ample seating  -Big patio  -Good bar food. The wings are legit. Awesome, even. I tried the nuclear sauce. It kept my friend writhing in agony for a minute, but I thought they were delicious. Tastes like a hotter sriracha.   -Awesome mixed drinks at reasonable prices. And the bartenders, who are great at their jobs, really seem to enjoy using their creativity.   -The beer selection had a couple of unique choices in the seasonal New Belgium collaboration, but was otherwise mediocre.   I'd come back here to eat, drink, and watch the game. Even when there's not a game going on, people can chillax and socialize as if it's just a pub. That right there elevates this into five star territory.   Staff and atmosphere make a huge difference!

The old, historic street of Glendale has better eats than you might think.  I've been here twice, and both times was treated to some of the highest quality ingredients I've had on this side of town. Only complaint is that the darn pizza falls apart while you're eating. But who cares when it's so good, you're licking your plate? If you're every passing through, you won't regret stopping here. Not the best value out there, but it's worth a shot!

Without a doubt the best food you'll find in Tempe Marketplace. The decor is creative, emulating everything that comes to mind when you think of enjoying BBQ on a patio in the South.  Nothing about the prices here are outrageous, and the portions...they're freaking huge! Being not much of a red meat eater, I ordered a simple grilled chicken sandwich. I couldn't finish it; there were two whole chicken breats, a mountain of *amazing* fries, and a fat slice of watermelon. Got it with a jar of sweet tea (perfect tea, by the way!) and a Maker's Mark mint julep that knocked me out of my chair. I also sampled some fried green tomatoes when were decent, and even  rib, which was the best I've had in the restaurant.  There are some poor reviews for this place, so let me preempt some complaints many of you would have while reading this review.  "But Taric! The service was slow!"  Even though it was busy, the server made my family and I feel comfortable and important. This is a large restaurant in the middle of a crowded urban center, they do their best and you should be patient.  "But Taric...this isn't AUTHENTIC!"  In a land of nothing but Chipotle this and somethingbertos, this is as close as you're gonna get, and they do a damned good job!  Quite frankly, this is the best BBQ I've had besides family cookouts. Ignore the yuppies giving it two stars and try it anyway...you won't regret it!

On an arid Arizona day, nothing sounds more refreshing than an icy margarita. You may be lured in with the tropical atmosphere. You may succumb to the charming (yet repetitive music). The decor is the best to offer.  Let me spare you the disappointment and say don't eat here for lunch or dinner. Just about everything you can order here makes it taste like the poor man's red lobster, and is even more expensive. Get the bang for your buck and avoid ordering anything but the generous portion of nachos (only above average dish as far as taste and value), and the perfect margarita (only drink guaranteed to NOT be short-poured).  If you visit Westgate on a Saturday night, you may be tempted to visit again. They book some live bands who do some pretty good covers. Speaking of covers, there isn't one to get in!  Don't worry, you'll pay handsomely for that at the bar. Six dollars for a 20 oz. Coors Light? Jolly rancher shots that are 50% cranberry juice? All from bartenders who spend more time tossing around bottles of bottom-shelf swill than actually learning how to make a drink. If you're already a bit buzzed, and want some good live music with a nice crowd, this will be an ok way to end your Saturday night. Unless you talk to security...they're jerks.  1/5 as a restaurant, 3/5 as a bar/club.

My search for *the* Irish pub may have ended here! To sum it up in one word, I could only describe RT O'Sullivan's as "legit".   First of all, the happy hour is amazing. Dollar off the reasonably priced drinks, and half-off appetizers. The fried zucchini was succulent, and didn't amount to discs of greasy mush like it does at most bars. The wings were tasty, and the menu is so expensive, you bet I'll be coming back.  Beer selection was nice. Kiltlifter, Guinness, and Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat are all I need.  The cocktails are where it's at. There's a huge menu of hot drinks, shots, blended drinks, and of course, anything iced. My Alligator Tail (Jager+Midori) was ridiculously strong and could have been mixed better, but then again I'm never one to complain about there being too much Jager in anything--it's impossible.   The chocolate banana martini was one of the tastiest drinks ever, and the mint chocolate chip shake (I can't even remember what kind of alcohol was in here at this point) was an incredibly refreshing desert.  I will be back here to dine, and stuff my face. I don't think anyone can go wrong here, it's that good.

Bold statement: This is the best bar in Westgate!  Some of you might not think that's saying much, but Hell's Half is a bar everyone needs to check out. It is the happy medium between those who want a nice gritty dive to get hammered in, and those who wanna dance and flirt.  The drinks are strong. The drinks are cheap! My favorite special is the "deer and a beer". For $7 I got a shot of Cazadores Reposado tequila and a pint of Bud Light. If you're a lily liver, you can substitute that.  And who could forget about the music selection? They play rap, country, emo, and blues. 10/10 playlist, and I love the music videos on behind the stripper poles.  Basically, Hell's Half Acre is Westgate's very own douchebag filter. You get nothing but fun crowds and good times. Come here with a good attitude, and I guarantee you'll leave with good stories to tell!

I have to go a bit further out of my way to reach this Total Wine, but it's worth it every time.  Bevmo says "Oh this summer beer isn't in season yet." Total Wine says "Of course, we even have it in the fridge."   Bevmo makes you carry a stupid rewards card that gives you 5% off a purchase after spending $250. Total Wine doesn't believe in stupid crap like that, their prices are good up front.   I really end up getting lost in the beer aisle, not knowing what to do. Saying I look like a kid in a candy store is an understatement, I'm like a kid who has discovered some cross between Disneyworld and Neverland. All my beverage snob dreams (er...my liver's worst nightmares) come true in Total Wine. Would recommend for liquor, too. If you can't find it here, what you're looking for probably sucks.

This is the poor man's Ah-So, so if you've been to that place, you can totally understand and stop reading now.  For those of you that make it a habit to eat good sushi, I don't know if this place will satisfy you. The interior is beautiful, and you'll see a hostess or two sporting kimonos. You have a choice of sitting at a table and ordering some grilled food (the price goes all the way up to $40 steak), or sitting at the sushi bar, which is what I came for.  It wasn't bad at all, 3-stars worthy, but like everything else, the price was a little bit up there. Poor Tolleson/Avondale residents...it's like they don't have a better place to go.

To my knowledge, this is the only reason to step within 500 meters of Metro Center. It's got nightly specials on food and drink...and even if you're not going for happy hour, the $10 burgers are much better than I'd expect from a dimly-lit dive. It's better than you'll find in a lot of sit down restaurants!   The beer selection is legit, with staples like Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA, Magners, and of course Guinness on tap. Makes me a happy camper.   Only issues are that it never seems to get crazy, and that it's a (yuck) Jets bar.

Tasty Asian cuisine, in the middle of no where? Yes!  I frequent the tiny village of Youngtown, and to my dismay I can never find a good place for lunch. That's all changed now. T & J is a quiet, unassuming little restaurant with tons of options. I found the quiet, pentatonic music awkward, but it seemed to fade as I browsed through their menu with excitement.  Before they even hand it to you, there's pictures on the wall of every dish. So, so many options. Roast duck? Chicken prepared in every way imaginable? And just look at those prices! So I ordered some honey chicken for lunch (so much food for so cheap) and it was of decent quality. It came with a crab wonton and an egg roll.  The reason I'm bumping this place up to four stars is because it has a small bar in the back. Most places like this only serve Tsingtao and maybe some cheap wine. They had some tasty liquors, and even a small specialty drink menu. Including a saketini. Those are my weakness! Time to knock back a few in dullsville.

Finally, I catch this place while it's still open! Admit it, fellow Yelpers, you, too have arrived here too late at some point.  It was definitely worth going out of my way. The place was even tinier than it looked from the outside. I had my choice between cramped seating in a tiny room, and the patio with a sun that is way too hot for November.  At the risk of encountering the usual CenPho crackheads wandering the area (and I did, mind you), I waited outside for my glorious kickass burger. Hatch chilies, chiptole may, jalapenos, guacamole, and bacon. Tasty! I thought hatch chilies were supposed to be hot, but they were a welcome addition regardless of heat. The bacon is questionable. I don't know if crushing the bacon into what is almost a paste is preferable to just frying the strips.   Also, the bun was pretty damned soggy. Not upset about it, as most buns can't hold the amount of awesomeness in this sandwich. Maybe...toast them? Get something better? Maybe I'm being picky.  Some people complain about it being cash only, but you don't walk into a psychedelic-themed establishment without carrying some form of green. n00bs.   Regardless of minor flaws, I am amazed by the price. $5-$7 for a burger combo of higher quality than any fast food place? Let's replace every McDonald's with one of these.

When it's a Tuesday night, and Cadillac Ranch is in dive-bar mode, I like it a lot. Chill music, nice patio, great specials on beer. Since the bar was outdoors, my pals didn't have wander off to have a smoke.  Weeknight specials are awesome. $3 pints of some good stuff like Mission Blonde Ale. I can relax here, and the interior looks so nice I'll definitely come back during peak hours. I'm a fan.

You're getting old. Your college days are over, and you have a crippling fear of "douchebags" or lightly dressed women who remind you how much weight you've gained since graduation. You tiptoe through the mainstay restaurants like Rula Bula while avoiding Sun Devils at every cost. Then you post unflattering reviews on Yelp while secretly knowing you've enjoyed every trip.  Mill Ave falls somewhere in between posh outdoor strip mall that tickles every fancy to unnavigable, clogged road, full of drunkards and the cops who babysit them. Either way, I'll be having a blast. Think to yourself: Where else in this town could you stumble out of the bar at 2AM, find yourself in a hookah bar until 4AM, then grab some cheap eats and chat until 6AM, when the booze starts flowing again. It's a cycle that can last as long as your wallet or organs do.  Seriously though, there's no place I'd rather be taking a stroll in the middle of the night. Paired with all the epic times I've had here with or without getting hammered, I'm afraid this is as good as it gets in these parts.

My greatest regret about Suite 301 is not checking it out on my first dozen benders through Mill Ave. Make sure you obey their silly dress code, or you're at least charming enough to be overlooked, and make your way up the staircase. Take note of the intervals between steps.  You'll probably have trouble walking back down.   My pals had no trouble dancing the night away. I'm more of a let's-get-drunk-and-observe-people kind of nerd, so naturally I went to the bar first. $5 pints are a steal when it's Saturday night and you can drink New Belgium Somersault like water. I didn't get mixed drinks, because fuck the mixed drinks when you've got this tap selection at this price in this cool of a club.   Several pints deep, I wandered away to the patio. Not bad at all--you get another bar, groovy furniture, and an amazing view. Hell, you can light one up if you fancy a smoke. Suite 301 combines my desire for nice crowds, good drinks, atmosphere, and friendly staff. I like.

Dick Jokes + Piano = Class  Such is the equation that makes Shout House so cool. Granted, I'm a good 10 years too young to hang out here. The cover of Vanilla Ice was foreign to me, and I didn't know the lyrics to the Duck Tales theme song well enough to sing along. But still, people were getting mighty drunk (on a Wednesday!) and still having fun.   On Wednesday nights, I randomly came in, and after a couple beers found out the glory of cheap well drinks until 10pm. The bartender is a champ; mine were poured perfectly. Me and my friend just perched up on the balcony, watching shenanigans ensue below. People sure know how to party.   The Yelp special for burger + beer seems pretty cool, and this is totally a place I wouldn't mind eating. If you didn't bring your "No Fear" tee shirt or five inch heels to Westgate, this is the place for you.

How I adore Maizie's...this is what CenPho is all about!  You have a nice interior that makes this nerd feel hip, and when weather permits a freakin' sweet patio for me to watch light rails drive back in forth without a care in the world.  You have a great selection. Gourmet hamburgers...epic salads...even pizzas! My mood for food can change on a whim...and you've got a lot covered, using great ingredients.   Even when I'm feeling cheap, you're not beyond my grasp. Your happy hour is amazing, and because of it I'll never ever go back to the Applebee's down the street. $3 beers and wines? $5 apps? Delicious, like the $4 burgers on Monday that are simple, but oh-so good. I thoroughly enjoyed the Hoegaarden on tap, and your selection of chardonnay. $12 for a bottle? Yes, yes, yes.  Service was also swift, and everyone was nice. And me and my lady friend agree: You have really cute staff!   Good eats, good view, great menu. 5 stars.

Now THIS is a grill. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the charcoal and feel a bit of heat in your face. When I saw the fire raging in the small kitchen, I knew I was in for a treat. I've ordered a couple of items from here. A simple asada burrito, and a pork  quesadilla. Neither of them disappointed.  Once I bit into my food, I was overwhelmed (in a good way) by the flavor. Well seasoned...smoky...cooked just right. They really know what they're doing.  There's also a small beer selection. 7 oz. Bud light or Coronitas, with 12. Tecate/Tecate Light. But if you go through what I imagine to be a hassle to obtain a license, why not expand on that selection a bit?  I will be back to try the lengua, and the tacos pastor. The menu is small, but what they do, they do right. If you want BBQ from someone who does it better than you can, drop by here.

I can't find a better Mexican grill anywhere. I'm addicted to their pastor, asada, and quesadillas. Their service has improved, so it's only a few minutes for my meal on even the most crowded days. And the prices are modest for the quality of your meal. Next time you're in the west valley and want Mexican, come HERE. If you had another place in mind, I doubt it's as good!

Great location and great decoration, but 'meh' sushi is Kabuki's specialty.  I'll give credit where credit is due and say their Samurai saketini was amazing, and one of the best drinks I've ever had. Too bad their sushi couldn't match such quality.   The Aladdin roll just just meh. They were wrapped with the seaweed on the outside, which I would not have minded had the entire thing not unraveled when I picked it up. Never needed a spoon to finish my sushi before! The albacore it contained was nothing to write home about, and the shrimp tempura was boring and bland.  The Lotus roll seems to be everyone's favorite, but I don't get it. Crayfish is ok I guess, but it's out of place when you just put it on top of a crappy California roll.  If you put Kabuki on Bell road to compete with REAL sushi places (like Tokyo Lobby), it would go out of business in weeks. It's in a posh spot, and looks nice, so it's great for rookies who nosh on store bought imitation crab. The happy hour looks like a value that's actually worth trying this place again, but unless I'm in the right place at the right time, I have a myriad of better places to bust out the chopsticks.

I went about trying that happy hour I mentioned a while back. The prices were happy for Westgate, I suppose, but still about the same as many other sushi bars throughout the valley.  That awesome saketini I raved about last time? It no longer exists! I tried to fill that gap with the cucumber Tokyo mojito and the lychee lime martini, but they just can't compare to my first love. Don't get me wrong, I'll knock back plenty of those perfectly balanced mojitos. But the martini? I appreciate using lychee in drinks, but the bitterness of the shochu vodka makes it a drink I'll only enjoy because of the lychee pulp. At $5.50 each, don't think your hour will be happy if you and a buddy have too many.  The sesame chicken was good after the first few bites, but just too darn greasy for me. Tough to finish. The rolls available are all below par, and that rose roll was disgusting! I know spicy tuna isn't the best sushi filling, but not only did it suck, the way it was just slathered on made me roll my eyes.  Along with that mojito (I'm guilty of craving one), the nigiri is some of the better stuff I had. The albacore was neat and delicious--but at $3 a pop (Okay...$2.95), I don't think it provides the push to boost this place into 3-star territory.  I'll inevitably be back with people that don't know any better, or just love Westgate in general. And I'll keep checking in. Don't let it go to your head!

Sand between my toes...tents with TVs...I don't care if it's by heavy traffic near the 101, this place knows how to deliver in the atmosphere department.  At night, Sandbar is a dance club. Not my type of scene, but despite the narrow space, this place gets packed. Yes, there will be some cute airheads. Pop your collar and walk right in!  During the day is when this place really shines. The $2 beers from 3-7 every day, along with the $5 appetizers is just great. Between slamming some Dos Equis, my friends and I enjoyed some miniature chimis and some tasty calamari. Their appetizers come out so fast, I almost had to question if they were made in advance. They were far too hot for that!  There are some entrees on the menu, but I'm sure they're on part with Chili's or a similar restaurant chain. Nothing about the food is fancy, but it won't be gross, either. This is as close to the beach as you're gonna get in this Phoenix.

30 seconds in this posh place, and I was already excited. They had a coffee bar, the most awesome assortment of bottled beverages I've seen in ANY hookah bar, and the atmosphere--oh my, is it lavish.  It was a trap!   $15 for a one hose hookah ties the priciest I've ever paid. Wait, what's that? It's $20 just because it's a Saturday night? Now you're pushing it. Well, at least I can split the cost with my friends. Four people to a hookah will be alright, I suppose. A cover charge, you say? Five dollars for each of my friends who didn't order a hookah? Alright, now we're up to $35 for four of us to share a one hose.  But the nickel-and-diming doesn't end there. You'll also be required to purchase a drink. No hard feelings about the drink itself--the introduction to sparkling Voss ($4) was welcome. But to pay for that after the cover...isn't that a little extreme for a hookah bar?  After shelling out what felt like a ripoff, I was still ready to have my mind blown by this place. Too bad I didn't even get to sit on the second floor! I asked, and received no reason why it couldn't be done when my party was the only one in the building. If you ever have the misfortune of coming here, you'll see why that's a big deal--the second floor is the coolest little balcony you'll ever see at at a hookah bar.  So I finally get the hookah. It looked like an expensive piece, but I was displeased to see instant light coals (low quality) sitting on top. I huffed and I puffed, but could barely muster one iota of smoke. After sucking ash, I complained to the waitress, who was almost clueless about what to do.  15 minutes later, I got my hookah back. It smoked alright...too bad they used the cheapest shisha. Why charge so much when you use such a low quality product?   I can barely even call Harem a hookah bar. I think that's just a front. It's a place to sip coffee and Voss in style, that just happens to serve subpar hookahs on the side. It's the most expensive place of its kind, yet has the worst quality I have ever encountered. One star is too much, and I may never go again...unless they let me smoke on the second floor.

This is a dive I don't mind stumbling into. Behind the run-down exterior is a dark, smoky room full of NASCAR ads and drink specials. $2.50 Coors and Coors Light bottles at all times...in fact, I think every domestic bottle is. My co-worker and I got some rum and cokes ($2.75) and they knocked us off our feet. With only a shot left in her bottle, the bartender approached me mid-drink and said "Well I can't waste this..." I like their style. There were some bottles of less popular liquors on sale, including a liter of Lunazul Blanco for $10. That's probably a steal, but honestly, do you think I can be trusted with that much tequila?  No ATM, cash only. Snacks are limited. This bar defines "dive".

This review might be a bit unique, since I came here not to watch a program, but a private event in which I was part of one! In show business, the slightest misstep can be an embarrassing eyesore, and I have to say that the staff here was more efficient and helpful than those running behind the curtains at any auditorium I've seen. My mic was hot when and only when I needed it to be, transitions between lighting were flawless, and as a result, the attention of the audience was unwavering.   When you're rubbing elbows with the valley's premier philanthropists and politicians, only the best will do!   And this is Yelp, so of course you wanna hear about the food, right? Before shuffling to the extravagant encore room, I only had time to peck at my exquisite entree of steak, a chicken cutlet, flavorful mash, and the most amazing grilled carrots and squash I could hope for. Yum. Service was top-notch, which an abundance of bussers swiftly meeting every demand between brief intermissions.  The tapas, however, were legendary. Bacon-wrapped tilapia and scrumptious pork empanadas were simply out of this world, with stunning presentation to match. Guests enjoyed these in the atmosphere, washing them down with a variety of libations from the swank bar.   On an avenue of strip malls with an auspicious lack of culture, ABT is an oasis for fine arts, or more appropriately, the finer things in life itself. Whether it's an amazing show full of talent, or a private event, I would recommend this to anyone with the class to appreciate the good life. It's as good as it gets!

If it can be done to Guinness, Lis Doon Varna is doing it. I loved the Irish Car Bombs. They used their homemade whiskey-based cream liquor for them, and it was amazing.  I get annoyed by the generic Irish pubs on every other corner, sporting nothing but a shamrock here and a Guinness ad there, but the decor at Lis Doon is refreshing. I'll update my review when I come back for the food...but don't let me have too many pints. Guinness and Cider is addictive.

THIS is what passes for gourmet pizza in Glendale? I think not. You're kidding me. Grimaldi's is a sweet looking place in the desolate Park West. The decorations are great, and there is plenty of Sinatra playing to further the illusion of class, but once you sit down and look at the menu, the disappointment starts flying at you.  Appetizers? I think not, unless you're feeling like salad. There is salad, pizza, and wine. Also, a full bar, with beer. Not that having a simple menu is bad, it's just that when pizza is all you make, I expect mind blowing pizza. This falls flat on all levels.  The crust I'll admit was decent. Just the right amount of flavor and charring. You're getting that right. But the tomato sauce? Nothing special. Do they buy it from Safeway? The cheese? Just alright for a gourmet pizza, and certainly not enough of it. As far as toppings go, I don't like the idea of needing to order extra cheese just to have my pizza covered. Also, I feel every gourmet pizza joint of this magnitude should have proscuitto as an option. 'Ham' just isn't cutting it.  Don't fret, the white pizza was okay. It used just the right amount of garlic, and had a fair balance. It was a bit on the bland side, and I would definitely have olives on that if I ever came back.  But please, Grimaldi's, spare us all your pretentiousness. No matter how many decorations (your plastic hostesses included) you put up, or how much backstory you have about NYC, you define mediocre. Don't offer me some BS wine pairing with your pizza, the only pairing it deserves is a mug of Budweiser and a Yankee's game. It's just not quality stuff. Some poor chump is going to waste $40 on a pizza and some $5 BevMo wine thinking he's dining on something amazing. Meanwhile, I'll be enjoying my meal at a place like Piazza Al Forno. Take notes.

Not sure how I didn't have a review up already...this Yard House was my very first bar when I turned 21!  Totally worth it. First of all, the beer selection is MASSIVE. You will find something you undoubtedly like. Ditch the domestics and shoot for a rare brew you're not gonna find anywhere else on tap. This is absolutely the most extensive draught selection in the West Valley, with everything from the sharp Green Flash IPA to the sweet Blanche de Bruxelles.   Need some food to soak that up? Don't worry, the menu has got ya covered. Especially during happy hour. This place has one of the best app menus you'll find. The wings have just the right amount of heat. The pizzas are a steal--I recommend the Thai BBQ Chicken. For my vegetarians in the house, there are some options for you, too, whether it's mock-meat or straight up mushrooms and veggies.   A small criticism I have would be the entrees, which never quite seem to hit the spot. Like the seemingly unseasoned burgers. I can't really endorse the several choices I've made outside of the app menu (well, besides their famous mac 'n' cheese). This place masters bar food, but can't seem to tackle the sit-down restaurant realm.   Overall, I'd recommend this place for a date, or to chill out with some beer snobs and have a quick nosh. Patio seating is a blast!

This place is so hidden, I forget where it is. And I *live* in the area. That means more top-notch, delicious coffee. In solitude. Mine...all mine!   (cue evil laughter)   But because Historic Glendale is often forgotten about in between its many festivals, A Shot of Java really is a good spot to grab a quality caffeinated beverage in peace. I prefer a good soy mocha, but they've got great lattes, an incredibly tasty roast, and even some of the more hard-to-find coffee preparations--very particular purists can even get a pour over.   It's stylish, but in a cute, old-school, small-town way. Hipsters beware, this isn't for you.   When weather permits, do have a seat outside. Especially when there's music. It's so exclusive!  Read some of the magazines or literature they've got lying around if you come alone.  Most importantly of all, check out the art! Glendale's got it going on too, ya know?

Between items that taste vaguely Asian and prices that can easily stack up, Sens is essentially an upscale Panda Express.  I'll give them points for concept, though. Basically, you and your pals want Asian food, but can't decide what kind. Thai? Chinese? It's whatever, you can get them both here. Portions are small, as everything is a well-presented appetizer meant for sharing. Between $5 and $11 a pop for these snacks, you'll find yourself spending way more than you would if you just ate an entree at a real restaurant.. Beyond that, items are pretty bland, and they really rely on sauces to come alive. I couldn't taste a hint of goat cheese in the wontons, and the Thai chicken lollipops were bland. They had to be drenched in wasabi or chili sauce.  I then realized I noticed a pattern. Bland fare that caters to a mainstream crowd who actually hasn't sampled Asian snacks. I will admit that it looks awesome. I'll admit that it tastes good, but then again tasting good doesn't mean it's authentic or worth it. Maybe I'll be back to try more items, in hopes that I'm all wrong. In the meantime, this Yelper has been jaded by similar (yet superior) places in Southern California. If you're a hipster who's ideal destination is around Roosevelt, then welcome home.

Way out west, we're saturated with hit-or-miss little Mexican spots. Paquime is definitely a hit, specializing in sandwiches and desserts.   So many kinds of desserts.   First, I'd tried the chocolate chip ice cream. The consistency and richness of it lets you immediately know it's the real deal, and will be totally satisfying. I also tried the nuez or "nut" ice cream...I think it was pecan? I'm not sure. Could not be any more vague...it tasted to me like pancake syrup ice cream, which I didn't like, but my breakfast-loving dining companion fell in love with.   After a few minutes, my quesadilla was ready (ha! I didn't even get a torta!). Instead of having precooked steak like a lot of the competition, it looked and tasted like it was made fresh to order. It was complete with tomato and avocado slices. I must admit it was a little skimpy--I ended up tasting everything *but* the cheese every other bite...but it was still tasting great, even if a bit on the small side.   I'll update you when I actually try the main attraction here, a torta with fries. But until then just know that you're getting some good quality stuff for the price, and that even if you're just feeling pastries or ice cream, Paquime is still worth dropping by.

Can't I just show you some pictures of Hanny's, give it six stars, and call it a day?   No? I have to be more descriptive in reviews? Fine.  This place rocks. Shut up and sit down at the bar. Order anything. You'll learn pretty fast. You can't go wrong with the Caiprinaha. I can't pronounce (or spell) it either, but they'll be more than happy to give you an intro to this high-octane Brazilian cocktail. Yes, it's $10 but you don't even know what cachaca is so pipe down and enjoy it. If you're a wuss like me, just stir it up with your nifty stick of rock candy until you can handle it. All cocktails are pricey, but most of them use high-end ingredients. All made by knowledgeable bartenders.  If you want dinner, just go with something that has prosciutto on it. I had it on my pizza and lemme tell you--you can't go wrong with this. If you dine at the right time, you can expect a DJ on the second floor.  But whatever you do, use the restrooms. USE THE RESTROOMS. Tell me you're not amused. I'll try not to ruin the surprise.  Overall, I've only been here a handful of times, but I don't think I could ever get tired of it. Here are some tiny nit-picky criticisms I have:  -It was totally cooler when the bathrooms didn't have labels on them. I think there were more mirrors (oops! spoiler alert!) too. I totally understand why it would need the slight adjustment, and it's still great for conversation.  -Several cocktails stood out because they used Bacardi Rum. At the risk of sounding like a snob, that discouraged me from trying the rum-based beverages.  -Your staff looks a tad worn out and a bit short. When I get carded twice to order a drink, I can tell that a lack of communication may spill into other tasks around the establishment.   -WHEN IS THE BAR ON THE SECOND FLOOR OPEN!? IT'S AMAZING.  I'll shut my trap. Just go here, you won't regret it.

It's the Spectrum Mall of outdoor shopping centers. Like someone saw Anthem Outlets, Tempe Marketplace, and Westgate, wanted something similar, and gave up less than halfway through. There are only like 2-3 decent places to go to, and nothing else. And one of those places is a chain restaurant (Kona Grill). The decor is terrible. The design encourages driving through it when it should be nice, round walkable space. The entire street is colorless and unattractive.   This is a perfect example of why so many people say Phoenix has no character or sense of taste. This is just a structure erected as quick as possible to capture all the income being spent outside the surrounding neighborhoods, and I hope it becomes a worthwhile destination someday. I won't keep my fingers crossed.

Bigger and more comfortable than the downtown location, IMO. This is THE place to watch basketball, and an absolutely amazing sound system to keep you in the game whether you're inside or on the patio. Draft selection is decent, and there are some unassuming cocktails for under $10. The app menu is also very affordable, even when it's not happy hour. Service was also spiffy, and our waitress was always great at making rounds even though it was a full house. I can't not recommend this to my friends.

Whoa! No one told me this was a GAY bar!   Security put on a grumpy face: "No, this is NOT--we're just in downtown Phoenix"  You lie. It's a Sunday night and there's a DJ playing house mixes of 80's pop, mostly Bee Gees. The interior design is perfect. TOO perfect. Many of the guys here, upon a second glance, are not actually guys.  There were some chairs and couches surrounding the stylish dance floor, but instead we went straight for the bar, and ordered those fancy white rabbit martinis. I'm slightly impressed with the taste, but more impressed by the sheer speed and precision of the bartenders. They are definitely up there among the best I've encountered. There is an extensive menu of local brews, if you fancy Arizonan beer.  If you need to step out for some fresh air, there's a simple staircase out back, where you can admire the exposed brick on your way down to a very minimalist 'patio'. I must say, the staff AND patrons here were insanely nice. Like...too-nice-to-be-Phoenix nice. Sidebar wasn't exactly my preferred nightlife demographic, but if my friends bring me back I'll have no complaints.

I know they're trained to say "aloha!" when I walk in, but it always feels sincere. When I'm done being all giddy about treatment as a valued customer, I usually order the white chocolate mocha. Maui has the best! There are a few hot and cold items here for ya, and a lot of awesome smoothies. Sizes are medium, large, and tiki. Tiki is a bit pricey, but comes in an enormous cup you get to keep.  My knowledge of Hawaii is very limited, but if I wanted to expand on that, there are plenty of surf/culture magazines scattered about the table. I just end up sniffing all the beans between every sip. The brews are that good!

After the holiday season and all its lights are gone, I start to worry a bit that Historic Downtown Glendale--my stomping grounds--will start to get a little bit dull. Fortunately, the fun wasn't finished yet. With Valentine's Day around the corner, everyone is thinking about chocolate...and Glendale has delivered! This is a large weekend festival dedicated to the cocoa you crave, and much more.   Basically, there are dozens of booths, many of which selling chocolatey snacks. Lots of fudge, chocolate popcorn, chocolate-covered fruit, etc. The absolute star is San Francisco Chocolate and its massive tent, serving up huge $5 slices of frozen cheesecake dipped in melted chocolate. I got mine dark, and couldn't even finish such a huge portion! Gosh, this really, totally, absolutely hits the spot.   But I wasn't done. There was the turtle popcorn from another booth, covered in melted chocolate and pecans. There was also some real food, and a lot of what I'd call "fair food".  I was practically in a coma by the end of it.   I think there are a few legitimate criticisms of this festival. It really comes down to the same two companies dominating the scene every year, and they mostly serve the same thing. That's no fun. Fortunately, there were a lot of cool, smaller booths I didn't recognize. Another is overall cleanliness. There were bees everywhere! They were attacking all the sugary snacks! This doesn't bother me, but it will probably bother you. Finally, there's a lot of stuff that isn't chocolate. I saw, for example, gourmet $22 dollar freaking salad dressing. Really? Is this the time?   But overall, I'm going to go to this whenever I can, and I can find something new I like every year. I'm a fan, and would recommend this to anyone with a sweet tooth.

OK, you know that when minivans from Maryvale labeled "West Side Cab" in olde English font are circling City North at 2am, you're in for a treat. Goodness gracious, a large portion of clientele are coming from the other side of town (I thought it was just me) on a *Thursday* night just to get down on some Latin music that this is indeed the real deal.   Yes, the band was amazing. Quality live music, not just your average cover band. It was incredibly loud as well, and I mean that in a good way. It felt like I was in an actual show, not a bar. It was PACKED, but seating wasn't too tough to find because everyone was dancing. My only problem is that said seating was right in front of the stage, so it was kinda hard to talk to anyone. I just kept slamming my reasonably priced Bombay Sapphire & Tonics from your very polite bartenders until I felt ready to get up.   I hate clubs, but I like this place. Kudos. By 1AM, the DJ was spinning some quality tunes, and some total strangers were trying to dance on me. My date got pissed off, but it was totally worth, and if any employees are reading this, know I owe you a hi five.   Overall, this is quite possibly the wildest place outside of Mill you could spend a random Thursday. I like. My only concern was that so much of the seating further away from the stage was unused, even when there was clearly a demand for it. There were no signs indicating it was VIP or anything, it was just reserved for what I presume to be the quiet, daytime restaurant hours. I'll be back to check out that cocktail menu sometime (I glimpsed the prices...you've got a LOT to live up to), but just know that at the very least I have to give my endorsement for Blue Martini's nightlife experience.

Their drive-thru is soooo slooooow, but if you walk right up, you'll get your coffee a lot faster! The quality of this establishment is above what you'll find out of most others. They actually know how to pull some espresso to keep it smooth, and the cocomo (coconut mocha) is a good go-to summer beverage. Only $4 is a steal for the size and quality you're receiving.   Not to mention the employee I assume was the manager was incredibly cool and nice! Everyone felt welcome! It's not perfect, but it definitely deserves your business...just endure the heat for 5 minutes and park.

Introducing the attitude of an Irish pub with the atmosphere of a nice lounge.  Classy. Or as classy as I can be when I'm pretty buzzed* and yelling at the Giants/49ers game. I wasn't going for either team, so I just laughed at everyone else getting fired up.   *But not buzzed enough to ignore some of the cooler features, like the projector showing games on the opposite side of the bar, the cool modern sink in the restroom, the extensive liquor selection, or the freaking delicious chocolate cake I had with my IPA. Staff was very personable...in overtime, they were right there watching the game with us, in suspense. Fun times. It's a really nice bar, and I'll be back for actual food.

Disclaimer: I knew nothing about Filipino food outside of adobo and lumpia before coming here. I'm a total noob.   But I know what I like, and I like Halo-Halo Kitchen. There are really several types of foods here:   The stews: Some, like pork adobo or menudo are more familiar. I had the chicken pastel, with potatoes and carrots simmered in a savory coconut milk mixture. It was alright. Just be sure to watch out for bones! Getting a little sharp piece out of nowhere was a surprise, but it's all good. Then there's my favorite--beef kare kare. Beef in a peanut butter sauce, with a very strong little side of salted shrimp paste to top it off with. I like both flavors individually, but can't say I agree with them going together! All this with two generous mounds of rice for $7.00 is INSANELY good.   Oh, and there was the dinuguan as well, or pork roasted in garlic and blood. Yes, it sounds weird! But it's not that bad. don't be a wuss ;-)  There are breakfast plates (read: silog menu), that have various grilled meats with rice and egg. Served all day! :-D  There's the deep-fried Filipino junk food like lumpia, which were alright. I'll for sure come back for the sisig fries!  Then there's the American menu if you wanna be basic AF  Save room for desert. The Halo-Halo is intimidating and probably has a billion grams of sugar, but I'm down.   Service is very friendly, but it's got the super local, laid back vibe to it in which employees are talking among themselves, on their phones, or watching TV while they serve you. Some people are irked by it, but I feel like I'm eating at someone's house. Groovy.   Other oddities include the really cool bar that appears absolutely STOCKED. My pal tells me it's so that customers can party hard on karaoke nights. This place has just about everything you could ask for!

This was a sight for sore eyes on Sunday morning. I had a long Saturday night, so a gently-lit room with soft music was the perfect place to get my brunch on. The long line was discouraging, but the staff was speedy, and the ordering process was highly efficient. Take a number, and they'll find you.  No more than five minutes later, my order arrived with a smile. It was the advertised lunch item, the "BBLT". I thought the extra 'B' stood for the balsamic vinaigrette that ruined robust, locally-grown tomatoes, and I was wrong. It was emphasis on the supposedly generous portion of average bacon in the sandwich. In that aspect, it was mediocre.  To make matters worse, the mayo on the sandwich was...very acidic, to say the least. Wedged between what I believe to be lackluster sourdough, this sandwich tasted way too tart. I don't even like their bread, I can say with confidence it ain't up to snuff after visiting some REAL bakeries in this town.  So after looking at the menu online, I see they enjoy taking a simple breakfast/lunch food and spicing it up a little...they shouldn't try so hard. My stomach churns at the thought of them messing up the paninis. Maybe I'll be back to try a breakfast panini, as they were pretty cheap (chicken sausage and apple? Hmm...)  Basically, there are some decent items to be had here, I'm sure. But...can you find a better brunch or sandwich for around $10? If you're on Yelp, you already should have. The food is 'meh', but at least the service is great. And that black currant tea. I want a tank to myself.

Overall, this is a decent place for inexpensive Japanese food, but you'll have to endure questionable service and a landmine of unsavory rolls on the menu on your way to a satisfying dinner. Also, show up early. If you wanna eat at 9, be there before 8. It gets PACKED. They close at 10.   I arrived around 8:30 and was understandably told to wait. At about 9 I was seated, and we ordered appetizers. The entire time, I was gawking at the menu like "OMG I can order like 3 different things this is so cheap". I ordered the terriyaki chicken as an app. It was freaking delicious, and came out in less than 10 minutes. My dining companion and I ordered 3 rolls between us. They are, on average, about $7 each for some decent stuff.   Only problem is that it took a bit over half an hour to arrive! WTF?   The hana roll was beautiful and tasty, with the multiple varieties of fish. Unfortunately, they fell apart rather easily, even for something so large it was cumbersome to enjoy with chopsticks. I still approve. The tootsie roll was not exactly what I was expecting. Didn't realize that all the contents would be cooked, and thought it was weird that there were tempura batter bits mixed throughout the rice. As for the tropicana roll, mango and salmon sounded lovely, but I didn't realize there would be excessive globs of mayonnaise on top of it.   I feel as though the menu does not accurately describe what you're signing up for, and that can result in disappointment.   In the end, I barely had time to take a couple of bites before a server dropped off a check. They were adamant about getting us out ASAP despite being patient with them. It's hard to knock a sushi place that's offering such great deals, but it really pushes my limits of how much questionable service I can put up with before I ding you. I really want to drop this to a 3, but I just can't. You were too easy on my wallet.

Even if you're turned off by trendy sushi bars, Moira is worth a try. The menu is quite large and diverse, with some choices that are generally hit or miss.   The Geisha roll looked promising (lotus root? yum!), but I was so overwhelmed by the cream cheese I couldn't taste what looked to be a promising experience.  The Sakura roll really hit the spot. I have a weakness for unagi, and it did well with the snow crab and maguro. Also, the eel sauce had a nice kick to it, and is now my favorite. Some argue these rolls cost just a tad too much, but once you remember the quality of ingredients going in to every bite, I'd say it's just right.  But this sushi alone is far from mindblowing. If the review ended here, it would be a 3.5 rounded down to a solid 3 stars. Moira goes the extra mile by providing an exotic selection of cocktails and beers. There are a dozen or so lagers and stouts from the far east. I ordered the Singha Thai lager, and my comrades had some pretty interesting stouts from Japan. Most sushi bars will only carry Kirin Ichiban, Sapporo, and maybe Tsingtao, so the diversity is welcome. Also, the cocktails are worth a try. The list seemed to have run of the mill drinks, with a few exotic looking options. I can only compare it to Kabuki's drink menu, only with what I assume to be higher quality.  I'll be back for the happy hour, or to be more specific, the REVERSE Happy Hour featured here on Friday nights. It looks very promising, and I hope this place keeps living up to my four star endorsement.

They aren't even called "Dolce Yogurt" any more, just "Dolce Water" because they only have Thrifty Ice Cream, smoothies, boba, and of course water & ice. I'd come in the other day for a good taro, but in embarrassment, the owner informed me that he was currently out. I would have forgiven this, but I then looked into my review from nearly five years ago...one of my first...and remembered that haphazardly running out of ingredients for things is a problem the owner has consistently had from the beginning.   Look, I'm sure this is a good place to get water. BFD, you can find that anywhere. I just know that when I have a sweet tooth, it's time to cross this place off my list and look elsewhere in Peoria. :-(

Something about watching a long line meander up a staircase into a room hidden from street view makes Vintage look much cooler than what it actually is. Sure, you might have caught a free admission + shot promo, but more often than not you'll just be paying a cover for:  -Drinks smaller, weaker, and more expensive than comparable establishments on the same road. This isn't just one Yelper's opinion, pretty much every other review points this out. Looks like they've earned the bad rep.  -Virtually no tap selection. Not that that's mandatory, but it sure does help when everyone else does it.  -Lame crowd. Not as much debauchery as you'll be guaranteed to find nearby. No one stays here; people just kind of warm up for a minute and take off to their next destination. I'm totally guilty of that.  -Lame patio. Virtually nonexistent.  It's not that you can't have a good time at Vintage. I really like their dance floor, and the bartenders are full of smiles. If this bar were in a different area, it would probably get 3 stars. I just can't in good Yelp conscience hype a place that's been consistently mediocre.

I've been to lots of clubs in Phoenix, but the only club I talk about lately is the duck club from The Parlor. Tomato jam interests your taste buds with the duck/bacon combo and aioli (okay...fancy mayo). I'd also recommend the Parmesan fries, which aren't the best by any means but still gosh darn addictive.   What I think shines here is obviously the pizza. I don't think the crust is as thoroughly cooked or tough enough to remind me of my favorite neapolitan pizzas, but when a pie topped gorgonzola and prosciutto runs at $9, I'll gladly accept it as an affordable, quasi-gourmet lunch. Wash it down with one of their groovy cocktails like "The Gentleman", with its cigar-infused bitters that taste like you're killing two vices at once.   Decor and staff are also nice. I'd recommend the dimly-lit booths for a date. I'd recommend the expansive menu for foodies. I'd recommend you get the hell over here soon--some selections are seasonal, after all.

There's an old idiom that reads "One's eyes are bigger than one's stomach". Whoever said that obviously ate at Lin's.   I find the decoration to be tacky, but I must admit this is the largest buffet I've seen in years. Three rows of hot food...a row of desserts, fruit, and salad. But there's more. A sushi counter and a Mongolian grill!  I'm going to be honest and say I haven't tried everything here. That would take at least 3 more trips. But I take note of the selection. It has every dish you'd expect at a place like this and more. Enchiladas, crawfish (seriously, WTF? And I mean that in a good way), or a pile of cooked mushrooms I wish I had room for. I wanted to devour everything here. Also, there's a full bottle of Sriacha at every table. What more could you ask for?  Quite frankly, I can't readily name a Chinese buffet that's better than Lin's. It was so close to getting five stars, but it activated a couple of my pet peeves. I don't like condescending signs that read something along the lines of  "Rules: Finish your food!" When my kung pao chicken was half peanuts, you're damn skippy I didn't clean my plate. Also, I hate not being able to get my own drink. It was 90 degrees out and of course I was going to be plenty thirsty. To be fair, service was fast, asking me if I needed anything every 5 minutes.  All of that said, I don't think this place is worth that fifth star. I just have a hunch there's a better buffet in the valley. Fellow Yelpers--help me find it!

DB never disappoints, but this is the BEST location in town, because not once have I ever had to put up with insane lines at all. Doesn't matter if it's 9am or noon or 9pm--they always have it together.   The more coffee I drink, the less I appreciate iced/blended espresso beverages. I usually just add a touch of soy milk and sugar. But not here! IDGAF how many calories it has, the Cocomo (chocolate and coconut syrups) is amazing, and if you give me one, it will be demolished in seconds.   Give it a try.

I'm a total noob when it comes to grocery shopping. I'm the kind of basic bro who still shops at a place like Fry's or Safeway most of the time. This alternative...or dare I say "specialty" store is pretty fresh.   First of all, the produce is definitely top notch. I have a juicer collecting dust, and am inspired to make it work overtime on the vast veggie selection they've got. It's all clean, well-organized, and at very competitive prices.   The sandwich counter is something most of my friends rave about, and I totally see why. $4 gets you a very solid lunch, complete with your choice of toppings. Pile on bacon or whatever for a bit extra. I had the peppered turkey and cheddar, and enjoyed every bite. Bread was great, and none of the ingredients tasted cheap. I washed it down with a mint soda, one of many unique, eclectic drink selections available.   With the exception of the cured meats near the sandwich counter, this place clearly specializes in more of a hipster diet of prepared vegetarian/vegan goods, gluten free carbs, and kombucha. I imagine your ideal trip to Sprouts should include a foray through the fresh veggies, some frozen organic meals for later, and a sandwich for now. It's small, but it's got the essentials.

First of all, let me apologize to the authors of half these reviews for actually thinking McFadden's primary function was a restaurant. That's just what they do to get by during the day, and you're damned right they are far from the best at it. Where this place shines is as a bar.  As a bar, this place is pretty two faced. It has an amazing happy hour. I've waltzed in with a few friends and received great service, from bartenders who gave great recommendations and were generally very amiable. It felt like one of those warm, 'hole-in-the-wall' bars where you could just chill and have a great time.  McFadden's does have a wild side. Late at night it is a full blown club. Lots of security is there to check the line at the door. Scantily-clad women (hoes) are paid to dance with their ass cheeks out on the bar, or pump you a draft from a keg. Not my scene, but if it's yours then you'll love it. It has a way of being a little bit skanky, but not sleazy or full of creeps.  As for the security, they (especially the head of it) are really cool guys. Don't throw a hissy fit when they ask you to take of your hat/sunglasses, and you'll be just fine. Overall this is a good place I enjoy chilling in when I have money to burn.

If you like candy/novelty stores, and you also like showing your friends how much cooler you are than the rest of them, Smeeks is gonna be heaven for you.  Call me a snob, but they just don't make American chocolate like they used to. Grab a CANADIAN Kit Kat, along with some other chocolate bars from our neighbors to the north. Aerated candy bars need to be the next craze here. As for other candies, take a look at all of the retro stuff. Nothing but old school sweets.  You can even wash that down with a refreshing drink. I got the lemonade...or, the Le-MAINE-ade, sweetened with pure maple syrup.  If you want shiny toys for a kid, you can find perfect gifts here. Give 'em something like a kaleidoscope. Little ones still think those are cool, right?   One funny observation: All the mustaches. :-p

Let's be real. You're only here because   -You don't really have options late at night in Terminal 3, but you NEED tequila.  -You're not from the southwest, so this is the best Mexican food you're gonna have.  Beer prices are off the charts, even compared to many other airports, AND the selection blows. I get margaritas because I feel less bad paying around $10 for those, and they're at least decent.   Even the chips and salsa are lame...you don't get enough salsa and the chips are ice cold. I've endured the tacos as well and weren't impressed.   The options are WAY cooler in other parts of the airport. I swear, Phoenix has better than this to offer.

This is my JOINT!  To be BLUNT, they have some of the best subs.  Cheba Hut is BLAZING a tasty trail for other sandwich shops to follow...ok, ok I'll PIPE down and leave the bud puns to the masters. This place is pretty darn good, and about the same price as Quizzno's, or whatever bland sandwich chain you've been wasting your time at.  The menu is expansive, and the motif is that every item must be named after a strain of weed. My personal favorite is the white widow (chicken, bacon, mushroom, spicy ranch) and it hits the spot every time. There's also a large VEGETARIAN selection (I recommend magic mushroom) for all those true hippies out there.  Even their fountain drinks impressed me. Come on, Watermelon/Grape/Cherry Kool-Aids as fountain drinks? Maybe I don't get out enough, but that is a rarity to come across.  This place has the best atmosphere, friendliest staff, and tastiest ingredients. If only they baked bread on site...it would then get an unwavering 5 stars.

If I had a dime (hehe...) for every time I wanted delicious Cheba Hut, but was too lazy to get it...well...I forgot where I was going with that. My point is that they deliver, and within a wide radius at that. Hopefully, it's in that groovy microbus.   They also cater, which is nice because let's face it--guys like me can probably eat a whole tray. I'll have them bring a platter or five to my workplace, and hopefully they can throw in some Bob Marley posters and glow in the dark stickers. Okay, I'll settle for another 4/20 frisbee.  In any case, any minor complaint I had about this place is either improved or easily forgotten. I could be vegetarian and just sustain myself with your magic mushroom subs every day. Oh, the alfalfa sprouts...someone just got the munchies.

A close contender for my favorite Mexican food.  It's not the most flavorful I've had, but it makes up for that in freshness. Besides, who needs their freshly grilled asada loaded up with salt? Get the California burrito and their cantaloupe agua fresca...you won't regret it.  If you're feeling brave, get one of those awesome looking seafood dishes on the menu. It almost seems to be their specialty. Come here on Friday/Saturday when the lobby is open 24 hours, and if weather permits, enjoy your time on the comfy patio adjacent to busy 59th avenue traffic. Sounds tacky, but you'll like it.  I think I'll be grabbing a midnight snack.

Once again, my quest to steer clear from corporate or chain coffee has led me to a pleasant surprise!  This place isn't nearly as hipster as I expected. In fact, it was calm, mostly quiet, relaxing, friendly, and most of all inviting, which is kind of the exact opposite of a hipster coffee shop (I still love you Lux don't worry). It was a bright and airy late morning, with a jubilant gentleman playing acoustic guitar.   I ordered a cold brew, which was delicious. Their pastries are good, too. The vegan brownie was light and tasty, and my friend totally loved her scone. We'll be back to try some more of the fuller breakfasts.   Apparently, they've got some craft draughts in the afternoon, so I can see this as a place to have a quick pint on a warm afternoon. It's a bit small, but with great atmosphere, kind staff, and good products, so I'll certainly return!

Came here because everyone knows the unassuming spots in strip malls are where it's at. Was not disappointed.   I don't even like egg flower soup, but I like theirs.   They recognize that Ceylon tea is for casuals, and serve Oolong instead. Legit.   The $9 combination plate it was included in was too much food for the price, but still didn't suck. Orange chicken was full of garlic and just the right amount of spicy. Sesame chicken was also great. Crab puffs are above average. The miniature fried shrimp are also a nice touch. There's no way you can finish this in one sitting!   Only regret is that it's way too greasy. When you deep-fry something, you've gotta at least attempt to get some of that extra oil out! I forgive you though, Cafe China. While I might pursue some other options, like coconut curry, I have a new go-to place for Chinese in the northwest valley.

I'm already a huge fan of Total Wine, and this is better and even more expansive than the other location I frequent, by Arrowhead Mall. If you can't find what you're looking for, it's probably because you're in the wrong aisle. They've got almost everything I could ask for. What they don't have, they'll try to help you find, or at least let you know when they'll get it in.  The store manager (Andrew) is a boss. He takes time to help customers, even though he probably has more important things to do. He has great recommendations for beer and wine as well.   I don't always splurge on high-end adult beverages, but when I do, I'll do it here more often.

Don't get me wrong, the prices are great, and I'm sure you'll find something you like...it's just that I've never seen food replicated so many times under so many different names.   The sesame, orange, and honey chicken all taste almost exactly the same. So do the...like, three varieties of terriyaki chicken. One time, I'd shown up, and there were items that didn't even have descriptions. I just tried to guess based on appearance.   It's also severely bland, for the most part. I feel as though every single item could benefit from a clove of garlic or something. That being said, it's super cheap to-go, very clean, and if you fancy dining in, the interior is actually quite nice. I don't really wanna endorse uncreative Chinese food, but who am I kidding? I'll probably come back when I'm feeling super lazy.

I've never been so intrigued and cheered up by a store before.    This place is so...miscellaneous, so I'll try to break it down.  Candy: A wall of Haribo products that I didn't even know existed, a long with a boatload of other sweets that I haven't seen since childhood. Major nostalgia points.  Toys: A variety of faux fireworks, like 'snakes', sparklers, or those things that pop when you slam them on the sidewalk. Nothing mind blowing except the selection and arrangement, which gives you strong impulses to purchase them all and go on a rampage of immaturity.  Books: Made me LOL more than anything else. My buddy picked up Postsecret for only $12, and as I perused the books, one stood out. It was by some author by "Mr. Pottymouth" and had some crude drawing on the cover with contents that may or may not be appropriate for a Yelp review.  Records: A decent selection of 70s and 80s music. I picked up a Rick James vinyl for $2. It said "special prize inside!" and when I poured out the contents there was a condom. Queue immediate laughter.  One day, I'm going on a shopping spree to recreate a long summer day of my childhood. There will be lots of little knicknacks flying around and popping in every direction, while my parents listen to music from the days they were allegedly cool. Another Yelper described this place as a "yard sale"...I wish yard sales could be this awesome!

I don't have a mohawk, or a shirt that says "The Smiths" or "The Clash", so I can only fit in Rips' social scene with my awkward attempts at charming wit.  When I heard the band jamming inside, and saw the dance floor packed, I was delighted to cough up the $5 cover. I saw the great selection at the bar, and guzzled some woodchuck winter cider while my pal grabbed some well-made cocktails. The wait wasn't long, and the staff was personable.   The bottled beer selection also rocks. I got the Red Hook IPA, and before I knew it I had a mighty buzz, with many strangers striking up conversations. The atmosphere here is friendly, and this is coming from a Yelper  who usually sits in a corner surrounded by empty PBR cans.   I just can't get the hang of that stupid game they have on the patio! If you try it and win, tell me your secret!  Oh, and one more thing: I kept hearing about "Obscura", which sounds like something so awesome that it's too cool for me to understand without checking it out. I'll be back.

This is blowing away other neighborhood bars in the area. Even though there are decent dives in the north valley, they are plagued by one of two problems: Either it's an old farts bar with cheap drinks, or it's young and hip with prices through the roof.  At O2 Lounge, you get the best of everything. There's a jukebox with a seemingly limitless selection to complement the badass sound system. There's plenty of room to dance, and even a stage for a live act.  The bar itself is also very aesthetic and the prices were more than reasonable for the size and the strength of what I got.  I know this place is out of the way, but if you wanna have fun without an abundance of douchebags and bankrupting prices, make this your next stop.

You know Happy Valley is a boring road when a Mellow Mushroom is the most happening spot for food AND drink. Good thing they take advantage of it!  So there's a bigger bar here than I've seen at other locations, and a respectable patio to match. Even if you don't come here for the delicious varieties of pizza, it's almost got a dive bar atmosphere...with a couple dozen rotating tap selections with some really awesome beers like Magic Hat. Also, they've got some insane deals on cocktails...like the "Irish Trashcan" which is pretty much an AMF with a little can of red bull opened up and dunked in your glass.   People are seriously getting their drink on here like it's the Mill Ave location. I love it!

My favorite Mediterranean lunch spot! For no more than $8, I get a huge, flavorful gyro (or chicken shawerma), my choice of rice, salad, or fries, and a fountain drink. I can never finish a whole meal, and every bite is delicious. You can tell the owner really cares--he makes sure you're enjoying your meal, and even chats up some sports since ESPN is ALWAYS on.  They throw the gyro meat on the grill after it's carved, and this makes a world of difference. I'm spoiled now, and feel like most gyros at a casual place are very lazily made. The salad is loaded with feta and some other toppings...if only they'd ease up on the vinegar a bit. The texture of the fries tells me they're made from fresh cut potatoes, and they taste loaded with garlic and some other spices. I like them with tzatziki, which they do very well.  Hell, I've even tried the lentil soup. And I hate lentils! It was yummy. I've been to a lot of casual Greek places for gyros, and they don't measure up to Babylon. Sure, it has some minor flaws, but I can overlook that when the food is this good.

Look, I know what (not) to expect from what is actually a Motel 6. The rooms themselves are so-so for the price range, but the service is TERRIBLE.  I booked my stay online, and it was a WASTE OF TIME. The first receptionist (albeit a sweetheart) was absolutely clueless that such a process even existed. Ignoring the small deposit, with the summary of the remaining balance listed in the online confirmation I had her read, she had no record of any reservation made. Despite being charged a small portion of the night's charges already, my remaining balance was ignored, and I was charged the full amount.  "You don't need to make reservations; we're pretty much NEVER full", she said. This is important.  My room was a bit lacking in basic bathroom supplies, so when I returned to the lobby late that night I was blown off by the second receptionist. "We don't keep any of that here", she said sternly, moving on to the next task*. EVERY hotel and motel I have ever been to (read my reviews, I go to a lot) keeps items in or near the lobby. This is unacceptable, even for this chain.  Oh, and by "next task", I mean telling two gentlemen there were no rooms available whatsoever, despite the fact there were still openings online and the previous staff member acknowledged the facility was no where near capacity.   So basically, there is complete ignorance of the online booking function, an absolute disregard for basic hospitality, and at worst, the unethical practice of straight up lying to potential customers to deny service. Never coming back.

There's a full-sized sand volleyball court, half a basketball court, and some huge tin trash cans to play a larger-than-life game of beer pong.   The outdoor seating is just that HUGE.   Indoor is comfy, too, with a killer sound system and nice A/C. Bartenders are way nice. Shots and mixed drinks were all like $5.   Yes, it's in the middle of nowhere, but this bar kicks ass. Drive the extra 10-15 minutes from Westgate and have a blast.

In the West valley? Craving a burger? Smashburger is your only option!  I had never heard of the place, but after driving past it a dozen times, I went with my gut feeling and checked it out.  The small, simple menu contains no bad options. There are a few specialty burgers, which you can get as a 1/2 pound, a 1/3 pound, or a chicken sandwich. You can also choose your own fries, bun, cheese, and other toppings (fried egg, anyone?).  Like anyone else who lets their stomach do the thinking, I ordered a half pound Arizona burger with Smash fries. After a few minutes waiting in a cozy building with friendly staff, my meal had arrived.   The next 30 minutes are a blur.  Habanero pepper jack...chipotle bun...amazing guacamole and onions on a perfectly cooked and seasoned burger? Amazing! On paper, having rosemary garlic fries (and a touch of olive oil) with this does not compute, but you'll forget about that when you're shoving it down your face. This was one mesmerizing meal.  If you choke from eating too fast (I don't blame you, you won't be able to focus on anything but your burger), then order one of the beers they have...a limited selection from nearby breweries like Four Peaks and Sierra Nevada.  Someone is bound to argue with me giving this place five stars, but unless they can find me a better burger around here (NOT the Red Robin or Island across the street. Amateurs!), I refuse to go any lower.

Me, reviewing a Subway? Weird, I know. I wouldn't do so unless it was either amazing (not gonna happen) or something bothered me.  Every other time I come here, they're out of something I want. Oh, there's a special on meatball subs? They're out of that. I want a bread besides white or wheat? Usually gone. Do I just have bad luck?   This place is clean, but I don't like some of the workers (pay attention to me, old guy!) and I don't like the management. Not that I met them, but...  ...I get coupons mailed to me. This, I believe is the closest Subway. Why, then, do you not accept coupons? Are you that ghetto? I guess this is the Maryvale area. I'll probably be back out of sheer convenience in my commute, but I sure do have an axe to grind with your service. There are too many of your generic shops out here. You are extraneous.

If Rosati's delivered to my house, it would be the only pizza I'd ordered. It's amazing. The thin crust itself is above average and always tasty, but the chicago style is nothing short of amazing. All of their options look tantalizing. The 'double dough' (whatever that is), or the stuffed crust, which just two layers of dough with a sheet of cheese in between.  Speaking of cheese, they use great mozzarella. And they don't skimp on it, either. The sauce is robust, and I am often pleased at finding chunks of delicious tomatoes throughout. I honestly can't think of anything I'd change about this pie.   But that's not all. There are many items on this menu, almost TOO many. You can order sandwiches, calamari, and even *gasp* ribs. Seriously. There needs to be a sixth star for such overkill.  I know Yelpers in Phoenix are all about the thin crust gourmet, but if you're in the mood for something that sticks to your ribs, make Rosati's your next stop. You'll have no regrets.  Take the Taric Challenge™ and finish half a large Chicago in one day. It's a lot harder than it sounds.

Filiberto's in disguise!  Alright, slightly more generic than Filibertos. The shrimp tostada was too sweet (yeah...sweet!?) for me, like some sort of cheap ceviche loaded on to a corn tortilla. Silly me wasn't expecting it to be a cold meal, but whatever, that's my mistake. Also, the carne asada fries are made with crinkle fries that are salted before everything else gets thrown on. It's gross, and their asada tastes like day-old steak soaked in brine.  I've gotta learn how to starve before going on these drunk Mexican food binges. Or just give my leftovers to Cornell.

I usually wouldn't write a review about fried chicken chain restaurants, but they're ROTD worthy so maybe this is relevant. I'm usually under the impression that this is better than the other two large chains, but this particular location leaves me inclined to change my mind. Maybe their heat lamps are busted or something, because my food was not far beyond room temperature as well as dried out, with seasoning dumped on indiscriminately.   I don't even have high expectations for a place like this, but it manages to give me the impression that no one there really gives a shit, and they coast on the franchise name alone. I will eat literally anything on this intersection except for this particular restaurant.

Finally made that trip on a Saturday night. It was disappointing! When I heard the music blaring, and saw security at the door, I was getting a little hyped. I was patted down! I hate that, not because it is uncomfortable, but because it tells me that this establishment serves thugs, and is ready for trouble. At least they weren't dicks about it.  So I walk in, and what do I see? Two girls dancing, surrounded by a bunch of bald guys with neck tats. It was weak. The entire seating area in the back was empty, no one was even playing billiards. Meanwhile, security was pacing around with angry faces and earpieces, as if they actually had shit to deal with.  I stayed long enough to finish my Jack and coke, and I bounced out. "Where are you going???", the bartender called out, sounding disappointed. "Sammy's".   Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Exit 7. Their staff is nice, and the interior is awesome compared to most dives. There is just a lot of potential I don't think they're using. I hope it becomes a more happening place, or they won't last long!

My Evo has gone through some substantial abuse, so I finally made it here to get a screen fixed. Most of the staff was friendly, upbeat, and helpful, but my downtrodden helper was irritating me with her apathy. I have insurance, and went in with a broken screen. My phone was still fully functional, so a simple replacement would have been nice.  But apparently, that's just too much to ask for. They didn't have replacement screens for one of their most popular phone models, so I was told to just pay the $100 deductible and get something refurbished. I did so, disdainfully.  As they were repairing it, I had to ask--was there another way? I was informed that I would have to call another Sprint store and inquire whether or not they had one. As a customer service representative, she should be letting me know up front what my options are, not forcing me to dig for simple answers. She never cracked a smile, did not make me feel like a valued customer, and overall just did not demonstrate the level of knowledge one would expect a Sprint employee to have. That being said, my refurbished phone already has issues--as if it weren't bad enough having to sync my social media accounts all over again.  If I had had one of the more confident reps, this could have scored a 3. If you're a Sprint customer, you may want to select a different location for your needs.

With all of the nice lighting and the music blaring, this seems like a cool enough place to chill and smoke. The list of flavors is tremendous, and the place is always crowded. This shows all the signs of a place to become a regular.  The pieces themselves are pretty nice, and they use wood-fired coals (great!). Too bad the coals are way too huge and they will always, ALWAYS burn your bowl. Like, they know how to prepare a good hookah, and mix the right flavors, but 20 minutes into it it will always scorch. I partially blame cheap shisha (Note to hookah bars: Al Fahker or Deja Vu should be your standard shishas), but a skilled nargile craftsman will know how to keep it smooth from start to finish.  Oh, and that music gets downright BLARING some times. Having to yell to the person next to you isn't fun. I'd forgive it if the environment was fun, but it's not. There are many individual seats instead of couches, and stuff is often spread apart creating an experience less social than it should be.  The clientele also looks like a bunch of faux-gangster douchebags, but I can't fault Casablanca for that. It's not a BAD place by any means, but for $15 a hookah there are better places you can go.

IDK why more people don't shop at this location. I found better deals here than I do at local outlets. I had to abruptly leave the store before stocking up on some awesome styles that were less than $40. If I'm not careful, I might just spend an hour here and buy something for every outfit. This store is definitely overlooked, and it's my new go-to spot for casual/athletic shoes.

This is salty junk food heaven. I'm still not a big fan of hot dogs in general, but anyone should try dogs like the Sonoran, with the guacamole and crushed potato chips (queso flavored!) There are also small orders of fries, ranging from carne asada to one that I swear was smothered in like 3 different kinds of peppered mayonnaise (jalapeno, chipotle, etc.)   This is overkill.   This is too much, even for me.   It's only like $3-4 per item.    You might as well go, if you've got the calories to spare.

There are tons of locations throughout the valley, but to me, this is THE Long Wong's. Prices are substantially lower than other LW, and there's live music and a full bar. Wings or GTFO, order hot for some of the best you'll find anywhere.   Did I mention this is really cheap yet good bar food? Additionally, the establishment is dark, and can either be social or intimate. Tons of character. I love the graffiti in the restroom. Would recommend for anyone who loves Tempe, but needs a break from Mill.

Talk about a quality product. I used to think Ocean Blue was bland, but now I appreciate their flavor that's lighter and less sweet than most frozen yogurt. This is because they're using better ingredients, most notably they do not use high fructose corn syrup. Win.  Cheesecake? Great. Banana? A bit on the icy side, but I couldn't get enough. Coconut? To die for! On the rare occasion I have a sweet tooth, I'll indulge myself here. They have this awesome promo that gives you free yogurt if you get your cup at an exact weight. I'll be more than happy to try that out.  Pros -Great ingredients -Assortment of flavors  Cons -???

Back when Westgate was new and exciting, this place was a cozy cocktail lounge. Unfortunately, it was hijacked by Calico, who attempts to turn this into a nightclub with Latin flair. It fails miserably.  Came here twice--once on a busy night, and once on a slow night.  On the busy night, the narrow walkway and dance floor made it pretty hard to move around. I would normally not complain about a place like this being packed, but it was just not meant to be this kind of club. It's just an uncomfortable place to be.  Gave it another try on a slow night, only to be greeted with my worst nightmare. They were OUT OF JAGERMEISTER. Under no circumstance should that ever happen, especially in a bar of this magnitude.  Not coming here again unless I'm involved with that 'VIP special' they copied McFadden's with. By the way, EVERYONE GETS THOSE. Doesn't make them 'winners' or this place special.

The first movie I ever remember seeing was here, back in 1992. On and off through my life, I've dropped into this theater, and I've watched new releases no fewer than 100 times.   It's a huge lot where you park, turn on a radio, and watch a movie outdoors. The sound quality is not as good as it could be, but you're getting a double feature for around 7 bucks, so stop whining.  Bring a beer. Have a smoke. Cuddle up in blankets, when weather permits. If you're anything like me, you'll be too busy stargazing to remember what the movie was about. Oh, and here are some protips:  -Drive slowly: Lots of kids! Did I mention the playground for them? -Snack bar is glorious!  -Tuesdays are extra cheap -This place is ***CASH ONLY***  There are a few flaws, but you try maintaining an outdoor lot this huge. I've been here way too many times to give it less than a perfect score: it's awesome.  Take your kids. Take a date. Take your friends.  Just get over here!

Truly the best brulee I've had on this side of the Atlantic. Fairly priced, and really convenient containers, so I could put a lid on it and save my cup of deliciousness for later...not that it's destined to last I appreciate the use of all natural, local ingredients, and that when you get almond, it's going to taste like it packs lots delicious almonds. Likewise for orange. Don't get sea salt caramel.   There's about a 30-second delay between the sugar being melting under a blowtorch and melting in my mouth. How cool is that?

Is there much to say about this place people don't already know?  Yes, as much as a dollar a doughnut is pretty steep, but who can complain when you see them coming fresh off the conveyor belt? I don't think anything compares to watching the glaze harden between your fingers as you take the first bite.  WTF about that kids meal though. Two doughnuts and a bottle of sugary milk? You want your kid to bounce off the walls all week? Anyways, good product, good location. I'm a fan!

It's not quite a pan pizza or deep dish, but Vinny's is a pie with sturdy crust. It has to be, to support all the goodness that gets tossed on it. I had tried their Sicilian pizza...and it's not something you wanna have before a date. Whole cloves of garlic were baked into the toppings. There were also thick, generous slices of tomato, pepperoni, sausage, and olive. The cheese was quality stuff, and I didn't take a bite out of my meal that I didn't enjoy.  Two slices of a large and I was done. This is real food coma material!

As the flashy stage suggests, this is more of a music venue than a dive bar itself. When I'm just coming here to knock back a bottle of cider, it's alright, but when there's an act on, they do a great job of letting everyone have fun!  It's really loud, too, just how I like it. With the gnarly decorations, reasonable covers, and knowledgeable bartenders, I look forward to coming here for local shows!

At first glance, this looks like another dreary outdoor shopping space that no one but tourists actually shop in (ex: City North). But what always sets this apart to me is both accessibility and coolness. You've got bowling, clubbing, live music, cocktails, and comedy all in one spot. Amazing. Lovely. It's right off the light rail as well.   Best of all, there are a lot of nifty temporary events. Is it cold outside? Cool, there's a skating rink. Is there an event in town like Comic-con or the Super Bowl? No prob, there will be some nifty party to mingle at/get wasted/be seen. While I think there's room for it to be more vibrant when it comes to nightlife (ex: Westgate), it makes up for that with uniqueness, so I'm a fan.

When they shy away from shots, I always tell my friends that it doesn't matter how they feel about tequila. It's just something you have to learn how to do as part of a successful, complete life. But with Canteen in the mix, even the wussiest drinkers can find something that works for them.  Step your game up and get some MEZCAL. It's not sold at many bars, and my Del Maguey Crema had a sweet, smoky burn on the way down. Yum. I'll be back for the margaritas, and maybe even lunch some time. If Canteen were any more legit, you'd find a worm at the bottom of your glass.

Before and after pounding obscure craft beers next door, JoBot is always a good idea. The soy mocha is one of the best in the business. More importantly their menu doesn't mess around when it comes to grabbing some late night eats. I recommend the BLT, with its lemon zest cream cheese, but more importantly, the salad that comes with it. Or the vegan salad. Or the crepes. Or the tacos.   Just order anything. It's all good.   So just a recap, this is why I'm giving Jobot 5 stars:   +Open late +Awesome patio +Quick service +Good value on quality food and joe

Came here for what I can best describe as a disappointing, boring lunch. There aren't many hot items to choose from, and like many other buffets, have several varieties of chicken/shrimp that all taste the same. It's pretty bland and unimaginative.   Well, except for the sushi, I suppose. They churn out California rolls very fast, so kudos.   I know that any AYCE place demands the diner lower their standards for quality of a meal, but this falls even below that...often, items are overcooked and dry.   The worst part was that I apparently came within an hour of dinnertime...which is like 3pm, I guess. About 15 minutes into my stay, many items disappeared, replaced with new food that said "dinner only". Some of these, like bacon-wrapped shrimp, were clearly premium items. Others seemed quite arbitrary. A new flavor of the exact same item, for example, could be restricted. Strange.   It was also a hassle getting refills. Staff constantly circles tables, but ignores empty drinks until you explicitly say, in a kind manner, "WTF are you blind?" They're really just there to police staff and charge extra if you grab a dinner item, not all of which were explicitly marked. I understand the model they're trying to pursue, but it's unwelcoming to basically have someone follow you around and watch you eat.   So the service blows, as does the food. The only part I enjoyed was the soft serve frozen yogurt at the end. I probably won't come back.

My inner nerd has been UNLEASHED! Utilizing last weekend wisely, I spent my day here for a video game tournament. A portion of the store is dedicated to getting together and playing XBOX 360 with the best of basement dwellers around the valley. But that's just a fraction of what goes on.  Even though I'm not into comics, I could see Gotham pulling me into them. So many Marvel and DC classics...I started actually wondered if Captain America would survive the war, or how Superman would fend off enemies without his powers.  If you're a dork about Eastern entertainment, they've gotcha covered on Japanese video games, action figures, and Japanimation. In fact, they had an impressive library of soundtracks from various animes at deep discounts.  Don't start thinking I'm a huge dork, because you don't have to be to love this place! Nourish your inner nerd...and order something from the coffee bar inside while you're at it.

"Wow, this is better than Chipotle!" my friend said, before I had the urge to deliver a swift kick to her face.  "That's not saying much at all!" I replied in disgust. There is NOTHING I can compare this to. Basically, it's 'Creole' food wrapped in a tortilla, or made in a quesadilla, or in a bowl by itself. I thought the idea of chicken + andouille sausage in a wrap wouldn't work, but I was proven wrong bite after bite. I haven't bought from a food truck in years, and I think I'm gonna follow this one around for a while.   5 stars because it's better than I expected, and there's nothing I would change. Delicious!

I had a friend from Hawaii who said this was "a lot like home", so skeptical me decided to give it a try. Keep in mind that I have little to no idea of what constitutes Hawaiian food, but I know what I like.  And I like Leo's, if ya don't get me anything with spam. The BBQ chicken sandwich (yeah, I wasn't feeling adventurous) was a little sloppy but way good. I like how their sandwiches have generous cucumber slices rather than pickle, and a bit of this sweet, creamy slaw. The chicken katsu was also delicious, and they have some amazing sauces to go with it.  You can also choose between a fountain drinks or some awesome nectar they have in the fridge. Prices are VERY affordable, as this will cost you marginally more than a fast food meal, but you get way better stuff.  If you're like me and you don't know crap about food from this region, I can't think of a better place to get acquainted.

Tacos Atoyac reinforces my belief that the more expensive your Mexican food is, and the fancier the establishment appears, the worse it's probably going to be. I mean, EVERYONE knows that the *good* stuff lies in plain, secluded little strip malls that are easily overlooked.   Just pop in and get whatever you want. I am convinced Atoyac can do no wrong. I ordered a simple pastor burrito. Carne asada is easy to do, but the arduous process of choosing a marinade that's just-right is in my opinion the litmus test for whether or not a restaurant is legit. Part of me wanted to say it's too sweet, but as it disappeared fast, I realized it's unique, but really hits the spot.   Sevice was fast, and all meals come with grilled onions and a grilled serrano, which is just the right amount of heat for me, and definitely too much for most people who will read this. Be careful, and have some delicious horchata ready just in case.

Used a Yelp Deal for the first time here. Sweet!  Every few steps on Roosevelt lead to good times, but Filmbar sets new standards for a more groovy nighttime experience. The tap selection, while small, excels in the taste factor. Pear cider? Four Peaks Peach? At $5 a pint, I can have a real good time. Wine connoisseurs will also be catered to.  The lights are low, the lounge is comfy, and the DJs are fantastic. They are heavy with the foreign house mixes, and you should be prepared to dance in a warm, intimate setting. Looks like a good place to just chill OR take a date. Oh, and it's an indie movie theater, too. Can we give it six stars for that?  Also, this is reason #200 the world is a more interesting place if you take time to view it through a Yelp monocle.

5 stars for making an epic mocha. As other Yelpers have pointed out, the espresso used is much less acidic than what gets pulled at most coffee shops. Additionally, I had flavorful, chocolatey goodness instead of a mouthful of half and half or whole milk. You get a great view of the light rail, the option of a groovy patio to chill on, and some paintings to admire. The theme appears to be positive body image, which I find to be totally rad.   Tasty. Artsy. And don't forget the tantalizing snacks. People in this part of town look so busy chasing cabs and buses in their suits. They should probably chill the freak out and stop at One sometime.

I came expecting a casual, moderately entertaining experience, and left still laughing, a little buzzed, and definitely impressed. It was certainly memorable.  This place is pretty classy, with the majority of patrons (including me) putting effort into looking sharp. You'll need to bring your A-Game to blend in. Oh, and it helps if you're really social. The seating is...uh...intimate. Like, REALLY close. You'll have to consciously keep your elbows away from the patrons seated inches away.   The two-drink minimum doesn't bother me because let's face it, who WOULDN'T wanna knock back a couple in here? What blows, of course, is how overpriced they are. I mean, come on, my "Strong Island" was the night's "special", and was a mediocre cocktail for $15. Fortunately, that special came with a glass to keep. Okay, nifty.   The show was great, and the quality of service contributed to this greatly. Our waitress never got in the way or caused us to miss a joke. She was a little overwhelmed and slow in the beginning, but afterwards it was smooth sailing. We tipped her big. Toward the end, they had some sort of two-for-one shot special that turned sour when I realized the bartenders absolutely suck.   No seriously, HIRE BETTER BARTENDERS. They are TERRIBLE.   Stick to the beer and wine. Yes, you are going to spend a ton of money here, but that can be said about every venue ever, so I won't ding them for more than one star. This is the most legit place for comedy in the valley.

Are you not entertained? This is a great crowd, and a fun place to hang out. I've gone a couple of times during the amazing live band karaoke. When I brought my friend along to jump on the mic singing CeeLo Green (all songs uncensored, because this is for fucking grown ups!), the audience went wild and he disappeared to presumably walk around giving everyone hi-fives.   This is a good beer bar, in which you'll pay reasonable prices from the draught selection. It's an eclectic mix of brews that will please lovers of any genre, whether it's a hefe or a porter. The porters and IPAs are awesome here. Just be wary of ordering something a bit off the beaten path. My Dogfish Head 90 Minute seemed more than a bit flat.   The outside bar is where I prefer to sit, even if it's exposed to the brutal Phoenician summer nights. The inside is always packed...absolutely full when I enter, and it's not really clear how to maneuver myself to order a beer on the inside. Especially with live drums going on full blast and almost nonstop behind the taps. Awkward.  Overall, I'll be back many times to say "cheers!" and laugh with my pals. It's easily the most fun I've had in Cityscape.

We all know you're going to HATE paying this place a visit, but it's a matter of how painful it is compared to the others. Here, the seating is sparse, but they get you in and out pretty quick. I had a new license in 90 minutes. Other places may take FOUR HOURS for the same.   It was super cool that everyone was nice, and none of the staff looked ready to go postal. Even the people were pleasant and patient. Don't get me wrong, I refuse to say any aspect of this place is enjoyable...but you can do worse. Lots worse.

Respectable southwestern restaurant by day, intimate indie venue by night. Crescent is the spot for shows too big for a cramped little shack like Trunk Space, but too small for one of those uncontrollable, rowdy venues like Marquee.   I came here early for a Cold War Kids show and hit the bar. If anyone has ever done some drinking at a concert, you'll appreciate prices here. $5 for a 12 oz craft beer is more than fair, I've paid tons more for a Bud freaking Light elsewhere. I indulged in the $2 "Mystery Shot". No regrets, I think it ended up being some sweet, flavored vodka. Just note that even *after* taking it, the bartenders are still in the dark about what it is. Just prepare for something different in case it's something crazy like pepper SoCo!  Anyways, the sound is top notch, it attracts a good crowd, and I have zero complaints whatsoever about my experience. You hear that, Crescent? You're PERFECT. Don't. Change. Anything.

Simply surreal.   The natural beauty of the mountainous, desert landscape juxtaposed with flawless old western decor meshed to create a setting that looked straight from television or the silver screen. The multiple fire pits, as well as the stage with the very entertaining musical cowboy was too legit. It was too pristine and well-executed to actually be just an ordinary day at Last Drop. I admired this very much to and from the bar indoors.   Inside, the theme carries on quite superbly, even with the narrow little bar in the corner. This is where the magic happens. I opened my evening with the house Cabernet as I perused the app menu. It was worth every penny for the $6 glass, and I would have easily paid more in a place like this. Me and my dining buddy went for the groovy "trio" special, in which we enjoy three miniature sets of appetizers to get a feel for what this place is all about. We enjoyed:   Cheese croquettes: Nice and dry when I expected them to be greasy. Flavorful. The sauce they were immersed in was delicious, and if you gave me a large plate of these and a bottle of wine, I would be a happy camper.   Stuffed peppers: I found the goat cheese rather mild, and the prosciutto surprisingly too faint to contrast well with the sweetness of the pepper, but it was still refreshing. Almost palate cleansing.   Duck confit empanadas: I usually don't enjoy duck, and because I find them adorable, I'm partial to poultry alternatives. All of that has changed thanks to these morsels, which I will undoubtedly order on my next visit.   Despite being obviously prepared in advance (they come out FAST!), I had zero doubts of the quality of ingredients. I am fully confident in their kitchen, and can't wait to try some entrees.   I concluded my short visit with a concoction of mango syrup, mescal, and Fresno peppers. It was sweet, spicy, and smoky. I loved it. "Don't get attached" they warned, as the drink selection is liable to change quite often. While I may not be able to order that again, I will certainly return for many more suppers.

The building may not be as expansive as other locations, but staff certainly utilizes what little they have effectively. It's highly navigable, and there are some steals to be had on lesser known wines. We're talking BIG bottles for little prices.   Of course, when I fancied myself a nice port for an upcoming dinner party, staff was eager to help. The gentleman's name was Scott, if I recall correctly, and he spent time going over many choices with me. There were tons and tons of VERY pricey selections to be had, but since I'm a newbie, he sold me on the Montonico, which all my friends loved. Customer service like his can't be beat.   I wasn't counting or anything, but I felt as though this place has more wines than other locations, but as a result, fewer beers. The liquor setup was grand, as well. Especially the little room dedicated to mostly gift sets. I have lots of friends who like to collect cups from various brands, so I'll be back to spend significant dough on these. Groovy.   I'm beginning to notice each Total Wine location can be quite distinct with their strengths and weaknesses. I disliked the lack of beer import selections here (maybe I'm looking in the wrong place?) but it is still very much worth the trip.

Barney's Boathouse was just a blur to me. After taking advantage of amazing deals on their beers (Even the cute, 10 oz. 50 cent beers), I marched my way up the stairs...  ...and then some more stairs...  And on the third floor is a really chill patio. I freaking love upstairs patios, and this one delivers. Huge, intense heat lamps mean you should have no worries about the weather. I totally can't remember my bartender's name, but she was cool, and the $2 jello shots in syringes were the best decision I made that night.   What a nice Thursday night getaway! Also appears to be a prime spot for day drinking, too.

Sometimes the beer is so amazing, you've gotta get it from the source. At Phoenix Ale, the suds are so good it's worth going out of your way for a couple of pints. After braving what felt like the longest walk ever from the light rail (don't drink and drive!), I found myself in an airy dining room with plenty of options on the board. In addition to Phoenix Ale options, they had rare draughts from other local breweries like Sonoran's Pink Peppercorn & Fennel Saison. Stuff you're unlikely to find anywhere else. All for $6 a glass, which is lovely!  There's a small sandwich menu, rare beers, and plenty of space. This is definitely a notch better than other small breweries in town.

I never felt like I was eating anything here that was obviously old or artificial. Get any chicken dish, they're all high quality.   Get the sushi as well. Nine out of ten times I'll have sushi at buffets, but Mandarin really churns out the California rolls fast and with relatively high quality stuff. Yes, I just said "quality" and "California rolls" in the same sentence.   There are like at least a dozen different items I'll eat from here, and when I'm done I'll say dessert is also totally worth it. And it's not even that expensive!

A big slice of the great outdoors, sandwiched between suburbia and the local college! Bring kids, bring family, bring a large group of athletic friends. Saguaro is where FUN happens.  -A dog park with lots of running room  -Lots of places to play sports, including at least two soccer fields  -A vast playground for kids  -Several sand volleyball courts  -A huge, I mean HUGE area to barbecue.   -Citrus grove to gawk at historical sites or chill out under some very old orange trees.  -A cactus garden. I don't understand the significance of this, it's just a peaceful, special place to me.  Yes, I too miss the abundance of peacocks. They do still pay a visit from time to time! I usually don't go to parks as a form of entertainment, but when I do, Saguaro never lets me down.

I don't have particularly high standards for Chinese take out, but Yan's is noticeably a cut above pretty much everywhere else in the area. I went with my go-to dish, sesame chicken, and something about it tasted just so...REAL. Yeah, that's the best word. Like the chicken was bought fresh from a local store and not frozen forever. And the sauce is was lightly coated in tasted like actual honey...not a bunch of cheap sugar.   Their vegetable medley is also quite tasty. Portions are realistic for one person to consume, and not for 2-3 people like their cheaper competition. I plan on coming back. Often.

"Let's get our drink on in Old Towne Glendale!"  -No one, ever  That is, until this little gem came around. Taking a stroll between novelty stores and a pretty cool library, keep your eyes peeled for a little entrance reading "OTG". You've now stumbled in the best bar you're gonna find for several miles in any direction.  Expect tasty taps and an expansive wine selection. They've even got some 'draft' wine from from little barrels. You know you don't get that often! I took a seat and had a Kona Koko Brown, but if you want something local, they've got ya covered, even if it's in one of the dozens of bottled selections to choose from.   My only complaints are that tables were too close together, making it cramped. And that the lights are waaaaaay too bright. Like, seriously, it's 9:30pm, and it's so bright I feel like I'm in some office. Tone it down.   Because it closes early, and is pretty quiet, I'm gonna go ahead and designate this as a great day drinking destination. Just make sure you have a DD...there is a giant police station just a stone's throw away!

Since reopening last fall, OTG has made so many adjustments that anyone who discovered it in 2013 needs to become reacquainted. Pronto. As for all you newcomers, remember that the end of Glendale Glitters doesn't mean the end of fun in the Historic District. Authenticity is scarce around here. Enjoy the oasis of culture while you have a drink, eh?  I've gotta say I've only enjoyed a glass of wine here just once in the last few visits. It's just not at the forefront of the product any more. Now, the beer is more prevalent with the tap selections doubled to twelve (all rare finds!) and the bottle selection is one of the best in town. Seriously, for about $3-$6 a pop, you can find some really good stuff without the drive over to Total Wine. Emphasis on quirky flavors not usually seen at other trendy bars. Kudos for standing out.   Other expansion to things OTG does well is the food menu, upgraded and imported from the Inn next door. Nosh on bruschetta, chow down on a small cheese plate, or go all out on a panini. You can't go wrong, it's respectable food at very competitive prices.   As if I didn't already have you hooked, they cell cigars, and if you wanna be a manly man, you can have a puff out on the beautiful patio. I cannot tell you how aesthetically pleasing it is to chill out between all the plants and the trickling fountain on a fair winter night. Bring friends...relax. This is a slice of the good life at a modest price, all with some of the best service around. It's a real contender for my favorite (and most frequented) bar in the valley.

Without the neon cartoon bird decorating the front window, you'd never find this place while driving. I stepped in to be greeted with dim, red light, freezing A/C, and Miike Snow blaring from the ceiling, and then I knew this would be a sweet spot.   Okay, yes, it's a little hipster with the faux old-fashioned themes to their cocktails. They love their whiskeys, and it shows when everyone orders a Manhattan with garnished with a lone, giant ice cube. You could feel thrifty and order the "Codger" as well, with a shot of who-knows-what and a can of Old Style for $5. The beer selection features quality IPAs, such as Modus Hoperandi from Ska Brewing.   The bartenders have a bias toward bitter. I heart bitter, but I don't like whiskey. I saw a bit of tequila there too, but their selection doesn't appear too eclectic.   In the back is a narrow room with shuffleboard, foosball...and even ski-ball! Oh gosh, I love that, even though after a few my balls might derail and ricochet elsewhere. :-x  Overall, this place is stylish, comfortable, and has a good selection. I especially like the huge, communal table in the center that looks like it would be perfect for beer pong.   If they don't let me play, it's still cool. I'm gonna bring some friends here.

I think it's weird that boba is starting to take off in Arizona. When I'm in SoCal, it's everywhere, but here, it's until recently been a rarity in Phoenix. I'm very happy to be able to grab some in Arrowhead mall, along with coffee that's pretty good, or some assorted baked goods. You can even pick up coupons for Macy's!

WE'RE GONNA BE ON FOOD NETWORK  That's great...let's see...whatcha got here that's good?  [WHATEVER YOU'RE ABOUT TO ORDER] IS THE BEST  (Answer was different for my friend who ordered before me)  Okay, okay...catfish po' boy sounds good. And the catfish looked great, topped with red cabbage...but the taste was bland, bland, bland. No attempts made to season the batter it's fried in. Just covered with a mix of what could easily be mistaken as sweet mayo and some toned-down sriracha. The fries were way greasy and totally unsalted. I think it's totally groovy to get catfish on-the-go, but opportunity to add some kick to the lunch was totally squandered. Would pass over this food truck for one in this category that actually tries, like Jamburrito.   DON'T FORGET WE'RE GONNA BE ON FOOD NETWORK  *facepalm*...they're so annoying, too. -_-

The posters lining the walls talking about how good this place is are mostly from the last decade, because all the cool new burger place are better without question. So what if the fries come in portions you struggle to finish on your own? They're not that good. There aren't many cool toppings to choose from. Ooh, American cheese...I'm enthralled...not.   The burger is just ok. Not seasoned, buns aren't really toasted...just really low-effort. I would compare the quality to that of a place with a drive-thru, but a meal costs nearly what you'd pay at a sit-down restaurant. This chain is overrated.

Came here on a Saturday night at 1am. Music wasn't that loud, and the seats were 90% empty.   Waaaay back in my early Yelp days, I had reviewed this establishment under previous ownership. In a past life, this bar would have been PACKED, and had a really cool clientele. Sure, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is still cool, but the crowd had been reduced to a row of lonely looking women just pecking away at their phones waiting for something to happen that never does.  The net cafe around the corner seemed to house more excitement. Daddy O's was THAT boring.

Every bite of Lombardo's Gelato fills me with the kind of satisfaction one gets from listening to an amazing artist before they hit the big time. I've been treating myself to it for years, at whatever mall they pop up in, and it's better than more popular, hip places like The Gelato Spot. My favorite is the cantaloupe. Just BURSTING with flavor, with an amazing texture. None of that artificial crap. I'm thoroughly convinced that they'll some day set up shop in a more...affluent establishment, then the Yelp community will discover how amazing it is; boosting their popularity among people who can appreciate a relatively rare frozen confection.  Put some of this gelato in front of me, and I'm gonna get a brain freeze. It's so good I can't restrain myself!

Didn't even bother getting fry bread, because mobile chimis are the food of the future. Perfectly deep fried, with great chicken, and really tasty beans. $7 for a level of quality I only see in Tex-Mex restaurants. IDK what kind of beans they use, but they're awesome too, as is their salsa. I also love the use of mixed greens instead of lettuce. The combination of above average Mexican food and fry bread in one stop makes Emerson a food truck you shouldn't overlook.

New ownership, new review!  I always liked Cheers, so when I saw it undergoing renovation this summer, I was a bit hyped. New interior does not disappoint! Great lighting system. Nice TVs everywhere. Lots and lots of comfortable seating. Whoever designed it has the aesthetics on point.  The music also rocks. They play everything! And the sound system had an upgrade--you can NEVER have enough bass.  But I know you know you come here for more than sleek looks and cool sound. You wanna know about the drinks. On Tuesdays, specials include $4 Jager bombs and $2 PBR Tall cans. It doesn't get any better than that. There's also a little food menu, but I'll get back to ya when I try that.   Staff was very friendly and down-to-earth. I can tell they genuinely enjoy what they do, and that feeds into a fun environment. Cheers has all the foundations of a successful mainstay in the west valley. Like any new establishment, they'll have a little market research and fine tuning before they develop a solid identity, but it still works smoother than any other new bar I've been to. For now--it's all looking up!

Heavy on the seafood, not so heavy on the wallet. They have beer and sake! I'm already impressed. Vegetarians, prepare to hate me forever. I had:  Bacon-wrapped shrimp: I was skeptical at first, but this was good stuff! Tray after tray...piping hot...this seemed to be a real hit with customers.  Orange chicken: Good, and had so much of a kick to it I thought it was supposed to be General Tso's! Whatever it was, I'd eat more.  Honey chicken: Tasted great, but I have no clue why it was so oily. Watch out!  Mushrooms: They look better than they taste.  Coconut shrimp: Just regular shrimp in a delicious coconut sauce. Can't get enough!  If you raised your kids to be pussies who can't handle food that's different, you can grab them taquitos and pizza. There's something for everyone.  There's also a Mongolian grill, which you should try, and some pre-made sushi, which look good but should never be tried at any buffet. Just stuff your face with delicious chicken and fish, and wash it down with some Tsingtao and Sho Chiku Bai when you're thirsty. Buffet is only like $9, not including tip. WORTH IT. So while it's not by any means the best Chinese buffet I've checked out, you are for sure getting a good value. I'm a fan.

You DO realize the entire premise of this place is to feed your drunk ass at 2AM? I mean, not to discredit the culinary expertise of Paisan's--we just know intoxicated pedestrians lured by the wafting aroma of a pizza parlor are a major revenue source for them. Maybe I'm just the first to expose that fact in Yelp form?  I don't think you realize how much effort it takes for me to appreciate the spice of their slices after umpteen jagerbombs. Sober Taric fears what toppings like buffalo chicken might taste like to fully functional taste buds. See? It's TAILORED to drunk palates.  I also appreciate any establishment that allows creativity from employees. When you say "Hey...our dudes just invented this pizza, wanna give it a try?" I'm game every time. And it was delicious.  The coolest part might have been the cashier yelling out to me from half a block down the road, just to let me know I forget my iced tea. I sure as hell needed that, so much appreciated.   I'm sure they have other great options like calzones and stuff, but honestly, I'll never be around to see their day operations. After last call there's no telling where I might end up. But when last call is on Mill Ave, I'm not gonna lie--this ain't half bad.

It's like having a midnight snack at a friend's house, if your friend's house was a sleepless commune. Spots to grab a bite after the bars close continue to come and go on this road, but Aside of Heart has all the requisites to set up shop on this road.  [x]Paintings [x]Indie playlist [x]Vegan/gluten-free options [x]Total hip(ster | pie) vibe   Okay, AoH, you've passed the "totally belongs on Roosevelt" test. But can you serve a quality product? Apparently so, even though you might just improvise everything. The hours are unclear, even though they're "usually open until 3am". Fine, make it up as you go along. You may be out of ingredients for tons of stuff, but you'll think of something, like pineapple dateorade. It's delicious, so just take my money through your square app and make whatever you want. This is not a place for the picky.  I could have ended my review there, but I've gotta tell you about the backyard! They're rebuilding a stage, and there's tons of painting. Maybe I'll catch some live sets next time I check it out. A very eccentric employee named 'Angel' was tirelessly brushing away in the middle of the night. Whether it's serving up healthy food late into the night, or adding some color to this dreary desert landscape, it looks like this place just made downtown a little bit cooler.

I must say I will never enjoy Russell Stover or See's or Cerreta's again. W Xocolatl has introduced to me the BEST chocolate I have savored this side of the Mississippi. Only they use stunning presentation that makes these morsels ALMOST too neat to eat. Only they employ superb quality and unique flavors that keep me up at night pondering my favorite. Perhaps it was the white chocolate with a banana-almond praline? Nonono, it's the Cinnamon Spice with Thai chili flakes. Okay, definitely that, but the new summer collection has Earl Grey, rum, lavender, or scotch infused confections too good to pass up. You won't even need to try more than a couple varieties to realize why I've given it five stars.   If you can't make it to their location, they're distributing to some coffee shops in the north valley, but hopefully they can expand in every direction once they get settled in. I need my fix.

It was a little easy to overlook, but distinctly classy, even compared to the rest of CityScape's watering holes. We stepped in and waited...and waited...staff looked at us and kept walking, as if we weren't hip enough to breathe the air in such an establishment.   Don't make eye contact with customers who have just entered and then walk away. That's customer service you should have picked up at whatever previous jobs allowed you to land here.   "Maybe it's closing", I muttered, looking at the hours posted on Yelp. "They're still douchebags here."  Just before we were about to leave, your mustachioed mixologist from Michoacan swooped in to completely redeem this trendy bar. I am a gin man, not a whiskey guy, so I was totally lost regarding what to order. Good thing this is a bartender I can trust, I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of the "Ours is the fury" (strange name) that he recommended for my sweet tooth. I would have certainly tried more, but be careful! These are strong! It was a Monday night, and I had stuff to do in the morning.  But I'll be back, and I'm going to try several styles of whiskey. And recommend this place to my more manly, whiskey-loving friends. I find myself going out for a cocktail quite often nowadays. Between quality liquor and woody, classy decor, Blue hound totally deserves to see more of my business.  Oh, and there's food, too. I'll update you when I give that a try as well.

I don't get all the hype!  The toppings selection was OK, but missing some of my faves like white chocolate chips.   The flavors weren't too sweet, which I appreciate, but also bland AF. The only difference between cake batter and cheesecake was that cheesecake was over-the-top sour. The hazelnut 'gelato' (how does this qualify as gelato?) had the most mild hazelnut flavor I've tasted in anything, ever. It was also severely lacking in fruity flavors, which is a bummer.  It looks cool though, and the chiptune playlist is charming. I'll return at some point and hopefully there will be a lot of rotation in their soft serve. I wasn't appalled or anything, but for now it's probably my least favorite froyo in the valley.

Everyone (including me) is reviewing the food, but you also have to take into account that the other half of the building is a small nightclub. With live music. I was confused when I rolled up, like "what's up with all these ladies in heels? It's just a restaurant?" Anyway, the paisa in your life will be happy with the tunes here. I just personally don't like the gigantic police presence. No, seriously...they're everywhere. In front of every entrance and chilling out in an SUV at the edge of the parking lot, actively looking for someone to arrest.   Not a good feeling when you're just trying to grab a late-night bite. Not that the food was good anyway...as other reviews have pointed out, the carne asada can definitely taste old. We all know what something is like when it's sat in your fridge for a couple of days before reheating. I think it's gross to put up with that at a restaurant. Yuck.

I've passed the neon sign like a million times, assuming this was just some quiet little jazz house. I was wrong. It's a booming, hip, jazz house, and I'm a dummy for not checking it out sooner.   I was totally buzzed on a First Friday, the place was packed, and we were all bobbing our heads to this really groovy band called "The Stakes". Yeah, that's a plug for a band I've barely discovered, but they kick ass. The acoustics in this venue were divine. Loud, but not overpowering with some crappy PA system (like certain small venues on Indian School). Cool and comfortable, and no one has to leave all sweaty (Like a certain small venue near Grand).   I had tons of fun. I'll come back with my friends. The BYOB thing sounds weird, but I can deal. Just don't look at me weird if I waltz in with a case of PBR. Kidding. Kind of.   Get cultured. Go to The Nash.

As a microbrew enthusiast, nothing quenches my thirst like a beer I've never heard of. Angel's Trumpet has tons of those, and one would be wise to follow their Facebook and keep watch for elusive elixirs like Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA.   Initially, I wasn't impressed with seeing Crispin, Rogue, and Deschutes, but my bartender was able to find the right pint for me. It was categorized as a "Sahti", and it is was freaking delicious.   The food here looks like common grub anyone can enjoy (pizza, burgers, etc.) but with an emphasis on finer ingredients. My friend ordered the pop tart, and it looked tons more fancy than your average breakfast snack!  The atmosphere is calm, everything is super clean, and there's a great patio. This is a place to have a nice sit-down dinner, or socialize in a quiet, almost classy environment. I'll be back to try some dinner, and I'll keep my eyes out on the taps!

You are now aware that Zookz makes uncrustables for grown-ups. And while you can't get a PB&J, they are delicious.   I must have stumbled upon a meeting of sorts during my first visit to Zookz. About six workers stopped, looked my way, and greeted me with huge smiles. I can tell when someone is faking it, and these grins sure were genuine!  I wanted the very best they had to offer, so without hesitation I went for their most popular lunch--turkey, bacon, avocado, and sweet mustard. It came with a tiny, but scrumptious side salad of kale, craisins, and walnuts. Delightful! Some say these are small, but this is a right-size lunch at a good price. Totally snagged a little jug of apple juice with my sandwich and dropped less than $9 for a satisfying meal.   A fair criticism to ding a star for is that it's not as flavorful as the ingredients would suggest. Rather than an eclectic sandwich, it almost tastes like the best grilled cheese you've had in your life. I would use less cheese and probably go for something sharper, just to let everything else shine.   Whoever writes the menu has some creativity and a keen palate for mixing flavors. If you're around CenPho and seeking a tasty, casual lunch, don't pass this place up!

There are several tiers of pizza in this town. You've got your gourmet, "Neapolitan" pizza to get snobby over. You've got your really good pizza parlors to sit down and gain a couple of pounds. And then you've got your cheap, greasy pizza to feed broke college study groups, cure hangovers, or just be a plain fatty.   Fox's Pizza belongs to that third group, and does it well. I like how this place is super-clean, and how they start rolling out the dough for my order right away. Tasty. Fresh. Cheap. How can I not like it?

Here's the Fox business model:  1-Cease distribution of coupons for several months 2-Post flyer inside offering something closer to a reasonable price than a special deal 3-Deny customers the price on the window, saying "Oh, that's only if you have a coupon"  So I can confirm it's definitely not worth the prices they normally charge. Specialties cost as much as what you can get at a place like Barro's or Old Chicago...but not half as good. All that aside, I'll go to a place that actually charges the prices they advertise.

It's basically Yard House without the extensive tap selection. If you're checking out this review on-the-go, this sums it up and you can stop reading here.   /review   But if you have the time for some context, then much obliged! I remember the old Bar Louie well. It's where Calico Jack's in Westgate currently resides. At the time, I'd just turned 21 and thought martinis were the key to adulthood. I have to keep reminding myself that these, and not beers, are Bar Louie's specialty.   Which would work if there were more than a handful of them. And a few selections are eclectic and high quality, it's just that if you ever get the chance to see a real cocktail bar like Hanny's, you know having a few doesn't cut it.  It might be above-average for a chain, but the target audience still thinks slamming Absolut from fancy glasses makes them cool.  Anyways, I really want to rip on this place about beer. It's late Tuesday night, and no happy hour? That alone I could forgive, but $7 for LOCAL crafts...in 14 oz. glasses? Pints or GTFO. So now that you're losing to surrounding bars on selection AND value, let's talk about the atmosphere.   Pick better live music. The description on Yelp says the music is "background", but these horrific covers of songs of alternative we're supposed to love were near rock-concert loud in a mostly empty lobby. No one likes having to yell when it's not even poppin'.   If I go again, I'll try some grub and see if there's something from the spacious ambiance I've overlooked. But in value, selection, and atmosphere Bar Louie left me wanting a little bit more than it should.

Phoenix is lowkey one of the best places In America for good pizza. I've already got a half-dozen exceptional, go-to places throughout the valley, and every time I think the market might be saturated, I make my way into a new parlor that shows me we've still got ground to cover. A lot of the time, when I am going to enjoy a gourmet pizza, I want something that's 'super duper Italian' with imported everything, and crust made with Old World secrets.   Federal Pizza isn't trying to be like that. It's going its own way, and doing a fantastic job.   Ingredients are unique, and to an extent locally sourced. My friend and I split the Manifesto, with generous portions of Schreiner's sausage as well as goat cheese. On the side, we had polenta sticks. I thought these were strange, but with the dipping sauce they came with, I couldn't stop reaching for them! I must also note these pizzas are deceptively heavy, so splitting a pie and an app with a friend is not only reasonable, but surprisingly affordable.  You will be amazed at how low your bill will be as you leave satisfied.   You will be enchanted by the swift, friendly service.   And if you're like me, you're going to leave a little extra happy after seeing the small but legit beer selection.   tl;dr If you like pizza, get in here ASAP.

They were doing flavored crust before it was cool, and it's amazing.. Yeah, it's a chain pizzeria, but it's a lesser-known variety, so I've gotta tell the world! It's a lot better, IMO, than the big 3 delivery parlors. $10 gets you a generous large pie for those days you're just feeling real lazy. :-p

I am both amazed and impressed by the ability of the southwest valley to adapt to an expanding Latino market. Gone are the rotating clothing stores from throughout the years like Steve & Barry's that could never make it. Here to stay is this amalgamation of various small business crammed into a small space. It's good for the little guy as well as the mall as a whole.   You can get a bunch of clothes...most of which weren't extraordinary, or my style, but they're there. Statistically, someone on my friends list reading this HAS to be a paisa. Or in need of an inexpensive suit, at least.  There are other various services like phone cards, notaries, etc.   What really shines for me is the entirely separate food court, complete with a fruit stand in which I can buy a whole coconut, or some other, awesome, prepackaged fruit.   America has a lot of swap meets, but I feel as though this is the most true street market experience I've had on this side of the Atlantic. Many of you are going to make the mistake of overlooking this. It revitalizes a market that's had some bad luck, and is a real diamond in the rough that can be the west valley. I'd come back.

This park makes me want to be a skater. There's just so many wide open sidewalks that go on for several hundred feet.  This park is rather large. There are so many grassy fields I could use with my friends for a pickup game of flag football or soccer. My only problem is that many of them are not so level, which can take a bit away from your fun.   Regardless, if you're into any sort of hobby that merely requires lots of open space, I totally recommend this. There's ample parking on at least two sides of this recreational facility, and it's pretty new, so all the equipment is nice. I'm yet to see many people here, really, which means I can go for a nice jog in peace. I hope my review doesn't lead to Dust Devil getting overcrowded! :-x

I get it! You're supposed to get buzzed at Westgate, then come here and feel like every store is a good idea. Genius!  This is a less cool version of the outlets in Anthem.  Did you know Tanger is an outlet chain? Like, the deals you're finding are totally orchestrated nationwide? In normal outlets, businesses sell directly to consumers, which is where the groovy deals come from. In Tanger, you're dealing with a big, corporate middleman. No wonder it's lame.  Not saying you won't find something you like...it's just less likely here than the real deal.

Not your average sub shop!  This is the real deal, because it's not often you find a quality product at reasonable prices. Come with an appetite as well--these subs are nine inches, MINIMUM! That's a lot of bread, I know, but the bread is tasty and simple. No parmesan/oregano/12-grain gimmicks here.   I went with the Grilled Italian, and for as simple as it was I am still surprised at how good it was. Salami so robust I can taste the kick of black pepper throughout my meal. Sauteed onions and a little tomato to make it complete. Good subs don't even need cheese. Very few ingredients, but give them 10 minutes, and they'll make it well. I will definitely be back soon to try several other varieties.

In mere seconds, an excited teenager with a huge smile darted out of the shade to take our orders on an iPhone. Ooh, I guess Square isn't just for tiny businesses nowadays. Neat.  The drive-thru here (I usually don't use them) is the fastest I've seen in any Dutch Bros location. It was so quick, our order was ready when we arrived at the window, and we didn't have time to tell the other employee just how good our days really were! I mean...not that she sounded sincere or anything. Clearly, there's a Dutch Bros script they have to follow.   I bet if she had a cocomo as delicious as mine, she'd cheer right up. =)

It's awkward reviewing this because I know GCT is a franchise with multiple trucks that probably have some variations in menus. All I know is that this particular one in Phoenix is definitely a disappointment. Some older people I know dislike food trucks, despite all the gourmet establishments rolling around town. This is not an example of a truck you'd want to use to change that perception, but rather one that reinforces the dated notion that they all serve low-quality fast food.   $10 got me a grilled cheese with BBQ pulled pork, tots, parmesan ranch, and a can of pop.   Bread-Plain ol' grocery store bread. Small slices = small sandwich  Cheese-Tasted like store brand "sharp" cheddar. could barely taste it with other ingredients.  Pork-Meat was cooked correctly, but this was waaaay too sweet. Instead of a nice vinegar/BBQ flavor, it's like they just dumped some cheap sauce in and let it soak for a while. I definitely didn't like it.   Tots-plain, but at least done correctly  Parmesan ranch-Just plain ol' Heinz ranch with some dried cheese tossed in. Disappointing.  pop-Just plain Pepsi products   Overall, this is the quality of a high school lunch, not something professionally made for adult consumption. Never eat here if you have another choice.

This is waaaay out of the way compared to all the other cool Central Phoenix hotspots, but well worth it. Having finally decided to visit what is comparatively middle-of-nowhere, I have no regrets! Upon entering, the lavish Christmas decorations caught me off guard, and it was so fancy I thought I might be a bit too casual.   I took a few steps forward, and realized this place is casual...and rad! With the benches in the dining area, the stacks of crates in an open kitchen, and the unpolished, paper menus, this place was reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. That is, If my high school served beer.   The brews were clearly unique. Brown IPA? Strong, bitter blonde ale? In the age of craft beer that tries to make a name for itself, North Mountain is attempting to corner each and every niche ignored by big names like San Tan and Four Peaks. Will it work? Only time will tell.   The menu is pretty eclectic, but I tried a miniature pizza because I'm not as adventurous with food as I am with alcohol. Did not disappoint. All of my beers kicked my ass, especially the Belgian Trippel, which save for a haunting, slightly sour note, tasted very authentic (Trust me, I've been to Belgium).   So in the end, North Mountain seeks to do everything that no one else will, and for very good prices. Service was excellent, and it was a pleasure meeting the owner as well as his niece who served us. I wish nothing but success for this up-and-coming business. If they can start looking as professional as other breweries, and offer more than a handful of beers at a time, they'll totally get my elusive fifth star!

This is the type of sushi establishment that's more of a place to see and be seen than to enjoy a quality meal. That's why all the effort goes into a posh-looking bar. That's why the sushi has funny names (lol Pokemon Roll so kawaii) more memorable than quality.   Against my better judgment, I decided to go with a simple, tempura roll. The Vegas. It was executed quite poorly, as it was almost flavorless (how do you manage that when it has unagi?), and very gummy, indicating it was...uh...undercooked. Portion size was also questionable for the price, which would never bother me if the quality was at least average. I can legitimately say it's the worst Vegas roll I've ever had. I have had better sushi on several college campuses.   Next are the uninspired cocktails. Shiso leaf left untouched is a cool marketing tool to make a cocktail sound vaguely eastern, but it's neither flavorful nor aromatic enough when chilled to be anything more than an unfamiliar garnish in an otherwise forgettable libation. Only the "City Escape" stands out. Everything else is just a shot, some fruit juice, and some muddled "seasonal" fruit. How special can these drinks be if ingredients are strikingly interchangeable? Where is the cucumber? Lychee? I am disappointed. Oh, and the happy hour is pretty lame. IIRC, there's no reverse HH, something I'm more than happy to find down the road at 11pm.   A sushi bar that messes up sushi is already looking at 2-star territory. Atmosphere is nice and trendy, but that's negated by below average value. I'm still open to giving it another try someday, so I won't go any lower.

Come for the spacious, hip decor. Stay for the insanely inexpensive afternoon deals.   This would probably be a good place to grab a sandwich, salad, and a cup of coffee, but since they've got a bar and some cocktails, you know I'll never get around to the normal, healthy options. Nah, I'm gonna stick to the cool $5 items on the happy hour. Like the Lee Trevino, fulfilling my cravings for both spice and elderflower. Tastes amazing, and quite frankly, I'd pay tons more. Best enjoyed with other small bites.   If I ever make it early enough, I'll tell you about the bagels. =)

Another example of the fun and dynamic bars that keep Mill Ave a prime nightlife destination.   This place is cool! Like, hella cool! I can not think of a bad time to show up, as it will be awesome either way.   During they day, they've got an amazing happy hour from 3-9. This includes the basics, like incredibly inexpensive Bud Light drafts. But also some better beers, mixed beverages, and some appetizers for no more than $6. These are all steals.   They have other specials late at night as well, making it a very attractive option compared to the competition.   There's a typical sports bar area with plenty of TVs. A couple of these tables have old-school gaming consoles. I would be more than happy to lose friends over a game of Mario Kart 64. =)   Down the hallway, there's a row of arcade games, most of which are free. Nothing too unique in selection, but all classics. And they're not all basketball games, either. You can shoot some hoops, too! You know the arcade game I'm talking about, right?   Further down the hall is ample seating, so you can spend plenty of time socializing as opposed to just playing games. I've slept on Gringo Star for far too long, and look forward to seeing it at its most lively.

I HATE dancing.   The dance floor here is so amazing, I was drawn toward it. It was so dark...with colors flying everywhere. Extremely loud music. Perfect for trance. People were getting down!  I'm kinda lame though, so I went out to the patio and kicked it on the awesome furniture, drinking very reasonably priced beverages. I only recently learned that this (and everything on Melrose) are bars for LGBT, and wouldn't have even noticed if it weren't pointed out to me by my friend, who was literally nudging me toward the DJ.   If you like loud, dark places, go here. Definitely. Atmosphere is off the charts.

This was my introduction to pho, and I ordered to-go. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING. Fortunately, I made it through with the help of a friend, and had a delicious, affordable lunch.  So there's bean sprouts, rice noodles, thinly sliced steak, but of course you've got over a dozen configurations. All ingredients were fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed stirring them into the broth, which I assume was scalding enough to do serious damage if mishandled.   They paired well with a refreshing cabbage spring roll, made complete with thin slivers of pork sausage. I have never heard of sausage in Vietnamese food, but still, I'd definitely eat again. I loved the chili sauce it came with, and my only complaint was my broth not having enough of a kick.   Still, though, I'd totally come back and try all the things...but I'll dine in so that I can have my meal assembled by the pros.

Good cafe. Good baked goods. Great cheese shop. Fantastic wine store!   Although more reminiscent of my strolls through New Orleans than Paris, French Grocery is a solid destination for fulfilling some of the finer, rarer cravings I've had.  Perhaps it's the chicory-infused coffee that feels reminiscent of my visits to NOLA's iconic Cafe du Monde. This spice, the taste of which I'd compare to anise or licorice, has roots in the 19th century. During coffee shortages, most notably in the civil war, it would be used to stretch the supplies. The trend stuck, and even today this particular type of blend persists in the area. On my next visit, I'll pair it with their famous beignets!   The sweets are legit. I have only had a couple of the tarts so far, but they were delicious and affordable. For more savory baked goods, you can't go wrong with a ham and cheese croissant for breakfast It's surprisingly light, and you'll enjoy every bite. Since they open at 7am, it's a nice, peaceful spot to drop by during your morning commute!  Other noteworthy products include a small, but fancy cheese selection. The largest selection of all, of course, is the wine. I have only perused it, but look forward to indulging.   French Grocery isn't French enough to please those missing ventures across the Atlantic. Ironically, it's not even resembling a grocery. Still, it remains a solid spot for any time of day. Dine in, and grab some goodies to go.

Came in wanting a quick burrito, but left feeling like a total glutton and loving it. Kissi is a lovely, unassuming, and inexpensive spot that's the real deal and then some. All that and a bag of chips. Not just a Mexican spot, but...a sushi place!?  Yes. Absolutely. Mexican sushi is a cool new trend that bastardizes Japanese food even better than America does, often incorporating ingredients like grilled chicken and carne asada into a tempura roll. Some are a bit more traditional. My dining companion and I had a pastor burrito and the Ruby Roll, with cream cheese, crab, and shrimp tempura.   The burrito: I really prefer al pastor to lean on the sweet side, but I can admit that it was made pretty well here despite being salty. Some restaurants pair theirs with roasted onions and peppers, but Kissi stuck with beans (very good frijoles that don't overwhelm or act as cheap filler) and guac, which was surprisingly good. They warned me the salsas I chose (get the freaking tomatillo) were spicy, and it was no lie. I could barely handle them, and I can probably take more spice than you. Tread lightly.   The sushi: OMG OMG OMG I don't care if it was basically a dressed up California roll, this is an experience you NEED to have. Each piece was HUGE. Like, too big for anyone to handle in one bite, and meant to be consumed with a fork. There are ten for $10 and I would struggle to finish it. I am an eel sauce fiend, so it was great being handed my own bottle of the stuff as well as spicy mayo and soy sauce to use at my disposal. Gosh I hate having to ask for extra everywhere else! Average sushi invites you to show restraint, admire beauty, and enjoy the atmosphere. This sushi leads you to believe all aesthetics are lies, and true happiness is a big appetite...as well as finishing the side of crab by scooping it with tortilla chips and smothering it in your seemingly infinite supply of Japanese condiments.   Don't you dare judge me, I'm gonna go back and do this again like 20 times.   Can you tell I really enjoyed this place?

There seems to be a curse on whichever establishment opens up in this old house, but Melt is a parlor that needs to stay. I have my booze, coffee, and food options already taken care of on this road, so an ice cream shoppe is refreshing!  Tried the watermelon and cucumber sorbets. None of that fake crap like high fructose corn syrup or artificial flavor...it was all so fresh, you'd think they farmed the fruit that day. The price is reasonable, the quality outstanding, and you get to snack on a fortune cookie at the end. I have no regrets.

Oh yes, I love everything sake and this is the only place I've seen that devotes time and space to the very fun and versatile rice wine. In all sorts of flavors for just $2.50. Or in a saketini (OMG I LOVE THOSE) and a similarly astonishing low price.   I came during the freak winter storm we had in April, which might explain why it was empty on a Saturday night, with the DJ repping Virgin Islands and bumping some great dance tunes. It's in a strip mall, but easily feels as though it could be a packed little night club when the elements are more favorable.   Lights are low, seating is sparse...after the first 15 people or so, I'd imagine it'd be standing room only, with no patio. There are also a couple of TVs and a couple of pool tables if you want to treat this as a generic sports bar. I wish they'd toss the one in the back in favor of more couch seating and just make it a lounge.   I feel like if you put this bar in a different part of town, there'd be a line out the door, but no one ever thinks "let's go to 59th ave & Peoria!" when they wanna turn up, so it's a total mystery when the best time to stumble in is. The aesthetics are much more urban than what you'd expect as well, betraying its vanilla surroundings.   While it doesn't utilize limited space as well as it could, I genuinely believe this is a gem in the rough, which I'll certainly return to. My greatest concern is that people won't realize how cool SO is until it's too late. :-o

Came here the Sunday night before President's Day looking to party hard, and only Whiskey Rose could deliver. It's very minimalistic with the decorations, staff wasn't a bunch of jerks (like they would be at almost any other bar in this plaza), and people love to have a good time. Here's everything I like:  -Amazing karaoke. I had to turn around and second guess that a real person was singing Miranda Lambert, and it was not just a recording. We're talking talent that's almost an American Idol level. Wow. They didn't just do country...some guy was screaming into the mic on an emo track and patrons thought it was groovy. I like. I like a lot.   -Hard liquor. Hard liquor everywhere. This is the kind of place where manly men can show off and shoot "moonshine" all night. It didn't even break the bank. 3 beers and a Jack & Coke was less than $20 before tip.  -Space. Lots and lots of space to sit or stand. Patio was tiny, but if you need fresh air, it's not like it's far out of your way.   Not to say this place was perfect. This is the only bar in Westgate that does not carry beers on tap. Whichever beers that have in stock is also not made clear, and you won't really be able to ask over the blaring music, so just get a Budweiser or something. And finally, they were pretty gosh darn slow, as if the workers still didn't know where everything was. Is it that new? In any case, I had a good time and would love bringing back some friends. The competition to other country-influenced bars is very welcome.

Harumi is exactly what sushi should be.   It's fast, yet high quality. Doesn't matter much what color the rice is, it has great consistency that doesn't take away from the quality of their rolls. Their fish is great as well. Very nice tuna. I am still blown away by how it was ready within 10 minutes of ordering, or how during the day you can just grab some to-go.   It is inexpensive. Rolls start at $7, and perhaps the best deal is the $15 mini roll combo that nets you 15 morsels that aren't significantly smaller than other dishes and can easily feed two people. All in a setting that's casual, but still very comfortable.   If you're ready to sacrifice a bit of sushi bar showmanship of larger establishments, Harumi is *the* place to go for a tasty dinner.

It's no secret this is one of the most luxurious, aesthetic spots in town. To stay here you're definitely, as the millennials say, "baller". And that's why this is the only place that has, without complaint, charmed $14 out of me for a cocktail. It took seemingly forever to make! I didn't recognize the brands of booze used! But it was pretty, tasted good, and made by really chill staff who made certain I'll go out of my way to come back.   Rumor has it this place is way more affordable than you thought it was. Just peep the HH. Want to impress someone? Look no further.

I spent my Friday evening getting sloshed in a grocery store's pub.   No, this isn't my half-assed audition to write for VICE Munchies, but rather my reflection on the surprise when I discovered one could plan meals in lieu of binge drinking/eating at restaurants, only to end up doing the same in-store. I need an adult. Twenty Highland, with its conspicuously local name, seeks to quickly make you forget that you are indeed what's a makeshift chain restaurant enjoying Whole Foods cuisine.   Of course, I use the word "enjoying" loosely. I have literally never shopped at WF before, so this won't be a biased review. This place blows.   From the moment we walked in, we were told to seat ourselves, and that someone would be right with us. That individual didn't relay this message when he left to what I assume was the hot foods area. As a result, we spent 15 minutes awkwardly watching other groups greeted by employee #2. We were not paid attention to until after retrieving menus for ourselves. Because we first-time diners didn't know exactly what we wanted right away, I just grabbed a beer, while our "just a minute" turned into another awkward 20+ minutes of waiting for a waiter again.   Between the lack of spacial awareness, and embarrassingly poor time management, I get the vibe that these guys are just regular grocery store deli employees with no real service experience. It shows. Clumsy and slow, this endeavor works about as smoothly as that time McDonald's thought they could churn out competent baristas.   OK, let's talk about the food! $10 goes rather far here, as it can get you a local beer (that's like a $5 value!) a heaping order of fries, and for right now, a burger. Not just any ordinary burger, but the "Better Burger". It gets its name from being cut with mushrooms, which reduces caloric intake while being better for the environment. I like burgers, and I like mushroom burgers, so of course I had to give it a shot. It was bland, bland, bland. High quality provolone, but garlic aioli was nonexistent, and probably forgotten altogether. Burger was equally tasteless, but what's more offensive was the very mushy texture that tasted faintly of meat with tasteless filler. If soylent green were real, I'd imagine this is what it would taste like.   Portobello fries had a nice texture, but were completely worthless without the generous serving of mushroom dipping sauce.   My dining companion appreciated the quality of sushi, but notes that a 4 pieces per order, she'd rather pay more and get more. She also said it was cut awkwardly and difficult to eat, a sentiment echoed in the 2-star review from our glorious community manager.  The cocktails seem good, just know that they're not made with spirits so you're paying like $7 for spruced up wine and beer.   The atmosphere is kind of awkward. Either you're watching ESPN, which is totally cool, or staring out into the aisles and registers making accidental eye contact with all the ripped customers from the adjacent LA fitness who are in better shape than you in part because they're not eating a gigantic burger...not that I'm feeling insecure or anything!  Overall, the saving grace is that food here is inexpensive...but even then there's no incentive to order it here when there's already a hot foods section of the store. And if you're going to have a quick pint, is this seriously going to be your go-to spot? I think that if you're a big WF shopper to begin with, this is a really cool addition to pregame with a pint.   Otherwise, why are you here? Go to a real bar and grill.

It's a tricky location to find, or find parking in, but once I was there, I admired the atmosphere and let the waiter talk up the product since it was my first visit.   "Would you like to try a pizza starting with our vegan crust..."  My vegetarian dining companion salivated.  "...and topped off with our mozzarella blend and [a couple meat items]?"  At this point, I was confused by the angle of this place, and how this dinner was going to turn out. If you're not vegan, you don't care that the crust is. If you are, why are you advertising toppings made from animals first? Fortunately, reading the menu unveiled all the cool options and substitutions and whatnot. You can try pizzas that are 100% vegan. You can also load yours up with meat, with traditional choices like the "testosteroni".   At my most hungry, I am not an adventurous diner, so I ordered that. But first, my monkey bread appetizer. The bread itself is good, and the garlic superb. They could tone down the butter a bit, though. There shouldn't be a pool of it at the bottom of the basket. Overkill.  As for the pizzas, they're about $10 and 10 inches. The crust? Amazing. Great stuff. The sauce? forgettable. The mozzarella, and whatever it's blended with was also bland. The parmesan shaker had to come to the rescue! The toppings were also pretty lame, leaving me to wonder if they just scrape the toppings off a frozen pizza and put them on a really awesome crust.   The bar here is okay. I like to see some of the lesser-known tap selections, like Raj. My cucumber rickey was disappointing. I expect a rickey to pack a punch while at the same time being light and refreshing. Theirs was packed with way too much syrup, and I struggled to finish it. If you're familiar with my reviews, you know most drinks don't scare me away!  I can understand why this product was successful in the mobile food business. If I were out at First Friday, or some bar, I'd gladly pay to have their personal pie on the go. But when I'm sitting down in a stylish establishment, I expect a little better than what is obviously fast food quality. We could just as easily go to Hanny's or The Parlor for a pizza/cocktail combo at a similar price range. Maybe if I tried more exotic toppings I'd have liked it better. Maybe I should try their variety of food besides pizza. Maybe I'll give this place another try, but not before exploring the tons of other new spots in central Phoenix.

They've got good specials now and then, but it's really forgettable. Pizzas are way too salty, toppings are barely there, and the standard dough is practically thin crust, meaning you aren't getting much food while paying $13 for a large with 3 toppings. It's not that I would reject this if someone gave it to me, it's just that for the same price, I can indulge myself in way better products around the valley and feel way more satisfied after a couple slices. Maybe it has staying power because there are barely any independent pizza joints around here?

I'm all about finding deals on obscure craft beers, so when I can get the good stuff at $3 a bottle any day before 8pm, I'm in a happy place. Yes, this is seriously in the running for best drink special in town. Of course, I've still got some reservations.  If you've got claustrophobia (before you ask, I don't), avoid this place at all costs. It has less walking space than your average hotel room. Sitting in front of the beer list makes it a pain to read. You will oddly position yourself out of the way every time someone needs to use the restroom in the corner.   That being said, I'm not about to hate on this establishment because it's the tiniest bar I've ever set foot in. There are some gems to be found, and a great owner who knows his stuff about beer. I thought it was so considerate when he tried to warn/lecture this expert about how a beer would taste. The enthusiasm is cloying to a snob like yours truly, but it lets me know I can bring amateurs here, and they won't order a brew they'll hate.   My yelper pal, Ryan W., knows tons more about wine than me and swears this place is legit. Something about 2009 and fires in northern California lending to the price and exquisite taste of his most prized selections. Mad street cred.   As for snacks, there's the whole local sausage plate as well as some nice brownies. Yelpers who check in the first time can nab a sweet treat on the house! What a great business strategy.   As far as the social scene, be prepared to talk with strangers. It's got that real neighborhood feel to it. Maybe you can challenge someone to a game of Connect Four!   In a bustling urban center with no shortage of craft beer watering holes, this is another posh place to enjoy a diverse selection of beer/wine at a competitively low price. To me, it's a formidable option to pregame your night in CenPho, but not by any means the bar I'd consider THE destination. You'll never be able to bring a group, but you'll be able to share time with a best friend or two. If you're in the area, don't hesitate giving this place a try!

After the first hundred times childhood Taric was chastised at family dinners for "leaving meat on the bone", adult Taric swore to only eat the best boneless chicken he could find. No matter where you take me, I will literally never eat whole chicken, the way nature intended. I am a tender connoisseur.   So I finally made it to this chain that sprouted up out of nowhere, and I was pleasantly surprised! Prices were reasonable, and service was fast, Here's what's up:   Chicken: tastes like high quality meat, as opposed to thawed out or otherwise old. A notch above other chains.   Fries: The freaking best, I'm already hooked.   Texas Toast: I don't think it's that awesome compared to other toasts I've had,  but it's better than biscuits at a lot of other places.   Sauce: sweet AND salty so it'll be addictive. It's just science.   Another bonus is that this is slightly cheaper than other places. I think the massive 6-strip meal for about $9 after tax is legit, and easily split between two normal people.   Only complaint is it needs a bit more spice. Just a little kick of some pepper.

La Santisima, known in a past life as La Condesa, makes some of the best...THE BEST burritos and salsas in the valley. It looks like fast casual food, but it's a sit down restaurant that costs less than competitors while offering way higher quality eats.   Like the 15+ varieties of salsa, ranging from a spicy, smoky chipotle to a light, creamy cilantro. Your food is going to take forever, so you might as well enjoy as many as you can. They all come across as very fresh--none of that canned crap.   My burrito, the Gaucho, was up there with the best I've had. And I've had a LOT of burros. The grilled white cheese, rich steak that had a faint wine flavor, cucumbers, and some peppers. Amazing. Great! The portion was huge as well, and I could barely finish it. I have a HUGE appetite.   The coolest part was that it was only around $9. That's somewhere between fast-casual and sit-down prices, but with better quality than virtually any Mexican restaurant. For about another $4 you can add some awesome aguas frescas like the horchata, complete with a touch of strawberry. I actually don't like that type of fruit infusion in something I expect to be straight up rice and cinnamon, but I can appreciate the quality ingredients.   I'm sold on this place, and I definitely recommend you should go, but that doesn't mean I'm going to overlook a few flaws that irk me. The first is that I'm not sure the furniture is either comfortable, tasteful, or clean. The high wooden tables are much obliged for taller patrons like myself, but they were sticky...despite being actively cleaned as we walked in. Gross. The seats are shoddy as well. The airbrush-on-canvas Frida Kahlo paired with the "no no THIS IS HOW MEXICAN FOOD IS DONE WE USE PROPER NAMES" motif on the menu give this a unique, yet eyeroll-worthy vibe I can best describe as try-hard and totally hipster.   Service is questionable as well. Although I appreciate that everyone who is not American actually takes their time at restaurants, I don't find anything particularly complex that warrants 20+ minutes for a burrito, and tacos/beans/rice for my dining partner. This is on top of the 10+ minutes it took to get a menu. We actually had to get up and grab them ourselves! They were not really paying attention.   Oh yeah, and then there's the warm tap water. Gross.   Anyway, Santisima comes across as a place with great cooks that don't know how to run a restaurant. I can't say I enjoyed any aspect of dining in besides salsa sampling, and so I've gotta deduct points even though that was a 5-star burrito. Fortunately, you can avoid these issues by just ordering something to go, which is probably what I'll gladly do when I undoubtedly return.

Glitters is proof that people share many traits with species such as moths or crows--you put a bunch of shiny lights somewhere, and we'll come flocking without a game plan. I mean, just what is there to do here? It's not like the Historic District of Glendale is the most happening place.   Mostly, it'll just be a bunch of kids walking around. If you take anyone under the age of 12 here, they'll have a blast. I know I did when I was a little one. While there are many attractions for them, it's a bit lacking for the adult crowd. Yeah, it's a little romantic in the sense that for a brief moment, you feel as though you're in an actual winter wonderland. Other than that, it's the same vendors that show up for every Glendale event.  On the last day, the hot air balloon show is amazing, however. Go there. Every year. This isn't necessarily a festival for me, but I have to bump it from 3 to 4 stars because of what a nice gig it can be for a young family. That, and all the restaurants and bars extend their hours. You know how I feel about that. ;-)

So let's get this straight. $8 gets me premium ingredients tossed onto fresh dough and at my table in 5 minutes? You've gotta be kidding me. Sounds too good to be true.   But Za is just what you're looking for if you want a unique, filling meal with limited time. I tried the "Angry Bird", complete with gorgonzola, an interesting BBQ marinara, and marinated chicken. I have no regrets. If you're vegetarian, vegan, or even gluten free, they've got ya covered. Portions are generous as well.   If you're expecting some of the fancy, neapolitan stuff from Pomo or Cibo, you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for a fast lunch with above-average ingredients, this is amazing. Once I compare it to other, less adventurous pizza parlors, I've got no choice but to give it a 5/5. I'd totally come back.

Good Mexican food for people who like mediocre Mexican food.   This place smells so freaking good! Like, for once, I've stumbled in a place that was both hip AND authentic AND tastes great. It's small and humble, with prices on par with Chipotle, so I expect something great.   I went with a green chili (pork) burrito with black beans. I can say that while the beans & rice are good, the main attraction falls flat. It's not spicy. It's barely flavorful! what a letdown. I found myself dousing it with the green habanero sauce featured at the table.   Oh yeah, don't expect any sort of complimentary salsa bar. Salsa (and chips) will cost you a bit extra, and if you're going to shell out the $3, you might as well just drop the same amount for a better burrito + chips + salsa combo at a place like La Santisima...or even Qdoba. This is me dropping stars because of superior, accessible places in the same area at the same price point.   At the end, I washed it all down with a freshly-made horchata...but halfway through, I was dealing with coarse granules of sugar! Gross!   I'm in no hurry to come back.

They consistently make pretty gosh darn good coffee.   Whether it's been a mocha, americano, or the cold brew I had today, it's always been top notch, and without complaints. Their roasts are bold, and somehow, a bit spicy. I love that.   If you're not stopping by for a quick cup, have some crepes for breakfast. Their savory crepes like chipotle are good, so I'm excited to try the desert variety. Next on my list of things to try: fried ice cream. Having a little independent coffee shop in a suburban sea of chains is such a treat!

tl;dr It tries really hard to be a restaurant that's taken seriously AND a sports bar where you can let loose, and ends up being below average in every category except square footage. No, the beer doesn't make up for it.  Oh, are you about to read the entire review? I like you.   I can't quite put my finger on why the northwest valley is prone to having less than mediocre nightlife. It feels like everything cultured, classy, and crazy ventured off to Roosevelt, Scottsdale, and Mill, respectively. All of those areas have reputations, and the Arrowhead area is just a wasteland of chained restaurants, young parents trying settle down and put their ASU days behind them, and simple, blue collar workers who don't wanna live further south cause...ya know...  But what we really want to explore here is whether this fresh, new bar, which has been flaunted on local news can be a watering hole that hangs with the concepts it shares similarities with, such as Angel's Trumpet, Yard House, or Mellow Mushroom. So we'll look at beer, food, and environment.   The beer selection, which is supposed to be the main attraction here, is really a huge disappointment. Okay, they've got the basic Bud/Miller/Coors. Then the local brews from Four Peaks that pretty much everyone else does. I'm happy to see San Tan this far west, but that's nothing to write home about. Then we've got Widmer, Deschutes, and Leinenkugel...hey, wait a second. Did management pull the inspiration for this beer selection from an aisle in Safeway?  Here's some advice. Rotate in more brews like Green Flash IPA, which is well-known to beer snobs, yet accessible to everyone else. All but maybe 5-6 really popped out to me as something I don't see everywhere else. Another option is to get lesser-known brews from really popular breweries. The only example I see of this is the Deschutes Red Chair (which I had), which you can't get just anywhere. Even local brews like Raj and Sex Panther are hard-to-find compared to their more mainstream siblings.   Finally, the pricing of the beer doesn't make sense. Heineken and Newcastle are by no means "Super Premium" brews that warrant charging a buck more than almost everything else. I LOL'd hard, and it shows someone upstairs doesn't know what they're doing.  Okay, I need to talk about something more positive: The layout. Everything is new and shiny. There's a pool table and a giant couch, room to socialize that you wouldn't expect from a restaurant like this. That sets it apart a little bit from the restaurants that boast dozens of taps, but are sitting and bar room only. Pretty cool.   I admittedly haven't tried much of the food, especially when they messed up pretzel sticks of all things. It's a simple bread with an "IPA cheese sauce". Bread had WAY too much salt, with only a hint of flavor. the sauce itself had a curdled texture, indicating it was prepared incorrectly and at too high a temperature. It should have paired well with my smooth IPA, but was disappointing. I scanned the menu for other options, but it all looked generic...well, except for a buffalo chicken quesadilla. Sounds good, but I wasn't trusting their culinary expertise enough at the moment.   Finally, I've gotta have a few quick remarks about value. Prices are average. The happy hour looks legit, but 11pm is kinda sorta late for a Sun-Thurs reverse HH. When it starts at 10 everywhere else, that hour could be the difference in getting the business of someone partying early in the work week.   Overall, there are some positive things to say about Draft House, but besides the vast space, everything is average at best. If I want to try new beers, there are better places to do so down the road. If I want to shoot pool and watch sports, I can get that elsewhere on Bell. As for food? You picked the wrong street to open up shop on if you can't cook. I'll give it another try eventually, but I'm in no hurry.

It looks really neat. Has attentive service. A cocktail menu, even.   But I'm not that excited.   This is pretty basic as far as Chinese restaurants go around here. Either get a combination plate that's like 80% noodles, or enjoy the worthwhile entrees a la carte, with relatively pricey sides. I also believe they choose to make their sauces as safe and bland as possible. Hot mustard that isn't hot. Sauces that would normally use garlic, chili, onions, etc. are rather plain. My sesame chicken looked very presentable, but was just fried chicken on a bed of honey syrup. The fried rice was quite boring as well.   It's by the 101 and open on major holidays like Christmas, so I'd probably try it once more in a pinch.

Is there some sort of secret war to see who can serve the largest burritos in the valley? If so, Vaquerros just dropped a huge bomb on the competition. I was straight INTIMIDATED by my burrito. I questioned now only WHY someone felt the need to make them so huge, but HOW it was able to cost significantly less than the competition.   They prepare their meat a little differently. It seemed to be tenderized and rather finely chopped. It was marinated in...well, I can't put my finger on it. But the meat, pico, and guac inside seemed to pack quite a bit of lime. The salsa was bold, and I appreciated it not seeming to have any salt at all. Look, it was like 2am when I went here so I can't recall all the details. Just know this tastes different than all our local chains, and is well worth the change of pace.

I can't believe I'm giving a Filiberto's five stars. Yes...this is real life. And this is seriously the best location.   The lobby is open until 3am on weekends. Nothing extraordinary for this type of food, but they take VERY good care of the interior. Most of the lights are off, so it looks quite dim. Coupled with the soft music, it's like a scene out of some stoner romance film.   The employees are nice, and they care a lot more than anyone at any late-night Mexican place I've seen. They don't just yell out your order, they bring it over to you and present it with pride, as if you were at a *real* restaurant.   "And for you, sir, the carne asada quesadilla".  They actually take time (it was like a 10-minute wait) to season everything to perfection. Nothing about my meal looked rushed or sloppy, which happens at literally every other location.  Classy AF. If I'm around Indian School after last call, and I'm faded, you best believe I'm dropping by here.

If you're feeling a little hungry, drop in for some carne asada tacos. Reasonably priced, and a-ok in my book, even if I have to douse them with a little more salsa than usual.   If you're wanting a solid meal, go for one of their specialty burritos. It has like 4 different kinds of meat in it. A little on the salty side for me, but I was so satisfied with the beefy, porky goodness that I had to swear off flesh for a couple days after so I could recover from my meat hangover.   And if you're feeling real hungry...like Harold-and-Kumar-when-they-finally-get-to-White-Castle hungry, then go for one of the fries. I am convinced that no human being should attempt to try the chicken bacon fries alone. It's a MONSTROSITY. You'll WANT to finish them, but won't get through more than 1/3 on a good day.  It's a notch above the drive-thru places on every corner, but costs the same.

I didn't come here to eat, but to drink.   The Local is hip!  You get carafes of water with your order...whether you ask for it or not.   This place is stylish.   The music is great and just the right volume to enjoy it while you socialize. It's way aesthetic, and a good place to spend a night on the patio with your friends...and maybe even people-watch on a First Friday.   Most importantly, the staff, including the guy at the door are freaking nice. I will return.

This review is brought to you by Andrew C's Brews Cruise UYE! Don't hesitate to join up once a month in some day drinking with your fellow yelpers.   Anyway, Dubina is a pretty gosh darn good brewery that I'm elated to have in Glendale. Bell Road is absolutely full of drinking and dining options, so if a local business can last this long, that should be your first sign it's legit.   The beer is good, and of course this is what matters most. The IPA packed many hops, but not *too* many. It was floral as well. The pilsner didn't quite have that 'bite' to it--the carbonation on it and all their beers is very fine--but I enjoyed the relatively mild taste. They make great sours as well, with some refreshing fruit flavors. I feel their beers are above average, and they deserve much praise for creating a foundation of conventional, go-to brews that can please anyone.   Not to say everything they have is ordinary. There was a smoky, savory beer on the menu. I did not try it, as I don't care for those, but rumor on the block is that it tastes like a smoked sausage. Strange, but commendable. If you're feeling brave, it's not like you'll be blowing a lot of money trying new things. The pints I had were five bucks each, which is certainly less than what you'll usually encounter at similar establishments.   Another cool thing here is a modest food menu of wings, brats, and burgers. These weren't extraordinary, as they are obviously mass-produced, store-bought ingredients. But that doesn't mean they aren't decent. The burgers are large and kinda tasty. Fries are loaded with garlic salt and will leave you thirsty. Do try their hop sauce as well. It's all rather inexpensive as well.   Overall, I find Dubina to be a pretty cool destination I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. That being said, it is unusually rough around the edges for a place that's been open for about 2 years. It looks brand new. Decoration is sloppy and incomplete. Menu could probably use some more signature items than just slathering ordinary food in their very own sauce. I hope that in the future, this place finds the inspiration to achieve its full potential. I will see what the future holds as I periodically cheers to good beer and a great staff.

My coworkers are always bringing Daily Donuts to work, so naturally I had to see what it's all about. I hate heavy donuts, but I also hate the flavored air called "Krispy Kreme". These are in between, and large enough to feel satisfying after just one. They also understand how to properly apply icing, as nothing was too sweet.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that this breakfast snack takes a delicate balance of ingredients to remain delicious, and whoever prepares these definitely knows what they're doing. It's my second favorite shop in town for these, I'm a fan.

A solid spot for Mexican that's a cut above many other restaurants. When you walk in, you see an open, modest kitchen and a plain seating area. You're not here for the scenery, you're here to shove some tacos in your face!  Here's what I tried:   Horchata: Not often I see little cubes of cantaloupe and pecans in this beverage. Very sweet and enjoyable, but I'm accustomed to a bit more of a kick in mine...like nutmeg or something. I was also disappointed that while the menu said "aguas", this is the only one they have. No melon, pineapple, tamarind, or hibiscus tea. Bummer. At least it was only $1.80  Fish tacos: batter was pretty bland, and the smidgen chipotle mayo didn't help much. My dining companion actually added salt to this! Definitely needed to get bailed out by the grilled onions to taste complete.  Burro al pastor: A tad bit on the sweet side for me, but the grilled serranos sure did make this good. It was a solid, heavy burrito that was more filling than it looked.   Overall, this is a very inexpensive place with tons of options. I'll be back to try something new like the carne asada and chorizo burrito, or maybe see what their quesadillas are all about. I like my Mexican to have a little more of a kick, but the sides and salsa can remedy that. I'd definitely go here over the --bertos in the area.

Sweet! I can now get my Barro's fix closer to home. I'm sure most of you already recognize this as THE best local pizza chain we've got in Phoenix, and the thick, flavorful crust as well as awesome toppings are delicious for lunch or dinner.   Came here for a nice lunch special...two people dining in with two slices and a small drink each came out to just a bit under $10. That's less than you'll probably spend at any of the other options in this plaza. I'd tried the special "hot wing" variety with chicken and buffalo sauce and it was tasty! Just make sure the pre-made pizzas aren't getting too cold. Pizza should always be a hot lunch!  There are also tons of seats here, and the place is VERY clean. I look forward to coming back. =)

It's not often that I go to shows featuring well-known artists. Venues tend to be stuffy, overpriced, full of rude staff, and with drink prices off the freaking charts. It's usually much more of a hassle than it's worth just trying to have fun for three hours.   Fortunately, Club Red made my night much more enjoyable.   Pros:   -Great parking. Don't complain about the location, they need all this space!  -Drink prices are fair. $6 cans of average craft beer like Sierra Nevada, $5 PBR tallboys...you could do MUCH worse.  -Staff is nice. Security was always polite when needing to bust through some crowds to grab some idiot. They also didn't even bother interrupting anyone's good time to catch the 100+ stoners in the audience. I have never had someone be cordial to me while running a metal detector over me. Everyone is chill except the guy checking tickets at the door, who really seems to hate his life.   Cons:   -Poor design: Venue itself is linear, and all around poorly designed. As others have said, the sound quality leaves much to be desired. The sound/light controls are in the middle of the floor, instead of the back...because there's no room for it in the back. If you need to leave the building, or even just go to the restroom, the doorways are WAY, WAY too freaking narrow.   -Ventilation: Holy shit guys, I don't have anything against smokers, but there was a cloud billowing out the back door once the show was over. It was way stuffy in there as well.   Overall, I feel as though this is a less-than-ideal space with stellar staff who make the most of it. The booze didn't break the bank, and no one was a dick to me for the entire night, so I'm willing to forgive a lot. I wouldn't hesitate to return.

Other local treasures such as San Tan and Four Peaks existed well before I was 21, so this felt like getting to witness the birth of a brewery for the first time. After a couple pints, I've got to make a bold prediction.  I drank Freak'N beer before it was cool.   It's so good, there's no way it WON'T gain popularity. The "American Wit" is a very accessible brew. It's hoppy enough to attract IPA lovers, but still fragrant, sweet, and refreshing enough to level up drinkers who usually stick to hefeweizens.   And then there's the brown ale. It is THE BEST brown I have EVER had. Lots of beers boast chocolate flavors, but this is the first time I've tasted a real, distinct cocoa flavor. And it doesn't even overpower the rest of the ingredients.  The Belgian pale ale tastes as if they had taken an authentic brew like Corsendonk Trippel, and threw tons of hops in there. It's heavier and more bitter than a real Belgian, creating a unique flavor that's worth giving a try.   A really cool part involved getting the tour of the brewery itself. Never had I learned so much about the science behind beer in one sitting. I was disappointed to hear about how the FDA gives small breweries such a hard time! I'll never get political in reviews...just as long as some obscure rules stay far, far away from my ability to have a cold one. =)  Of course, not everything here is perfect. The IPA was sold out, and I'm assuming that's because it's so good. The cream ale was too watery for my liking. I get that it's 3% ABV, or as I like to say, "Utah beer", but the flavor was still wimpy. There were issues with the brand new taps, limiting the selection of to-go pints in a convenient Freak'N growler. But then I remember this isn't a *true* bar. It's actually a tasting room. If sales are favorable through the next couple of years, this family-run operation will expand.   I wish them nothing but the best, and I'll be back to try the brews I missed!

It's a vast, inexpensive selection of pretty much every and any Mexican junk food I can think of. Chamoyadas. Elotes...in a cup. Raspados. Other stuff I can't pronounce. Best of all, it ranges from like $2.50-$6 and it's all really fast. Empty calories...covered in chili...never tasted so good.   Raspado was legit, but so was my blended coffee. Even though I HATE anything that mixes caramel and coffee, this was...well, surprisingly good. And cheap. They've also got a small dining room that's great for kids, with all the toys strewn about. This is a great place to buy them a pinata for a party, as well.   And like everything else around here, you can buy phone cards and I think money orders, and other stuff I don't use or know much about. There's not much reason to be in this plaza, but if you are, don't hesitate to drop by.

Remember that feeling you'd get when you could step into a Central Phoenix bar your friends hadn't heard of yet? Remember how cool it felt to have a pint in a hip place that's NOT surrounded by luxury condos? If so, you're like me and already feeling nostalgic for late 2000s, when the middle of town was quirky, kitsch, and best of all--accessible.   That magic isn't dead yet. You can recreate it at ThirdSpace.   Begin at the stylish bar, with its groovy menu and its local, affordable draught selection. Wander into several incorporated businesses of your choice. Want to grab yourself a nice curio? You don't even know what that is, but I promise it's cool. There's also a tattoo parlor, barber, and...coffee? Yes, coffee. Why leave?   It's like Desoto Market for people who don't want to ruin Phoenix   It's like piece of Roosevelt Row that didn't sell out.   It's everything you want...you just have to brave the wrong side of the tracks. Totally worth.

Mucho Macho Sucko.   This trendy taco shop doesn't try too hard to feel authentic, nor does it insult your intelligence by pretending to be trendy and upscale while charging 2x what anyone with a triple-digit IQ would pay for a taco. It's got a real stoner, SoCal vibe to it, as though it were partially modeled after Wahoo's.   I will be straightforward and join the other 20 or so negative reviews that indicate this place has a major seasoning issue. For real, the carne asada here is some of the most flavorless I've had anywhere, ever. I decided on the "macho burrito", what I assume to be their signature item. It had asada, tater tots, green chili, and...mayonnaise. Texture was definitely interesting, but literally the only source of flavor was the chili, which was severely lacking. Let's save the mayo for seafood tacos next time. :-/   As for the shrimp tacos, they were well-dressed with some refreshing toppings, but the shrimp tasted as though there was zero effort put into them. Like...you could at least cook this with some pepper, please.   On the bright side, the horchata was great! 5/5, would drink again.   What troubles me most is how the owner has such a cult following. Despite jeopardizing one of the most critically acclaimed lunch spots on Yelp, absolutely failing to fill the shoes of Gallo Blanco and, when left to his own devices, squanders his alleged talent on tired themes suited for tourist beaches, he is somehow the most well-known purveyor of Mexican food in Phoenix.  It's not fair.   That being said, I won't totally disregard returning to this place, as they've got some unique items. Ideally, I'd love to have flavorful Mexican and American favorites in the same place. Unfortunately, Mucho Macho messed up some of the fundamentals, and I'm not so sure it should have come as a surprise.

Check my pulse! Between the old-school playlist and equally old-school consoles, I may have just died and gone to Gen X heaven.   The Pig's Meow is a sort of 'barcade', where you play video games while you drink. I say "sort of" because unlike true barcades, the games aren't quite the main attraction. You can enjoy some stuff like Nintendo or Atari from your table, sit at the spacious bar and chat, or go to the game room in the back, with an additional Nintendo juxtaposed with very some surreal hands-on games and old (but clean) furniture. But like its predecessor The Whining Pig, having some suds and talking with friends and neighborhood regulars alike is the main attraction.  I can most accurately describe the beer selection is exclusive and high end, almost more so than any beer-heavy bar than I've been to. That's quite a few. Even when the breweries are more well-known (ex: Green Flash), the brews listed from them are new or rare releases (ex: Passion Fruit Kicker). They've even got a list of the extensive 750ml bottles, corked and seemingly all limited edition.   And like its sister bar, Pig's Meow has some cheap eats. Like *really* cheap eats. We're talking grilled cheese...or even ramen, of all things. When my date was totally starving, it was splendidly polite of your bartender to prepare some Maruchan even after your 'kitchen' was closed. Keep in mind the locally-made sweets as well, and it's a welcome diversion.   And while there is much to come here for, there's a bit to figure out. The game room, which has fewer video games than the room housing the bar, is truly kitsch, but at the same time oddly configured. There are board games, but a lack of flat surfaces on which to set them. I was rather dismayed by the thought of where a glass should be placed. I'd feel rather bad placing them on a vintage table game, but I would feel absolutely mortified setting it on the floor. Your layout encourages us to resort to this, and there are some exposed surge protectors about just begging to have beer spilled on them. Coincidentally, the smell of smoke and fear of electrical fire cut short our visit, leaving us to abandon the round we'd just paid for as firefighters marched in. I would hope these two problems are unrelated.   Additionally, consumers should beware of beer prices that are a bit steep. Even the more common selections are easily running a buck or two more than you'll find them for anywhere else. It is as close to being objectively overpriced as I can assert in a review. Your acceptance of these prices, however, will reflect your beer philosophy. If to you, beer is a more casual alternative to wine and liquor--something you will drink volumes of to get turnt--this will leave you frustrated as you fork over $8 a pint. I feel you, and will at some point toast you with one of their $3 PBRs. If you believe beer deserves every bit of prestige normally reserved for more boozy beverages, think less of people for drinking said PBRs, have ever used the word "terroir" without irony when talking about beer, and like me, have an Untappd archive in the triple digits, this is going to be awesome. You, my friend, will be in hoppy hipster heaven. Both crowds should feel free to take advantage of the generous Happy Hour. For two or three hours each day, you'll have no reason to complain about anything here.   Overall, this is a pretty good, premium beer and wine bar (yes! They have wine! I almost forgot!) everyone and anyone should be able to indulge in. With bars that are a bit far apart, and no light rail for miles, Arcadia has never really been a place to hit up when going crazy all night. But if/when that happens, this is a place I won't forget!

Let's talk about the food.   The menu is just straight up American. No, not that nebulous American (New) stuff I see popping up. We're talking great for sandwiches, pizzas, flatbreads (I love when a restaurant can differentiate between the two), and salads. I stuffed my face with a lot of stuff here, so let's talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly.   The good: The pizzas are on point. Sure, the pesto gets a bit sloppy, but tastes great. And the tomato bacon variety is top notch, especially because they appear to be one of the few restaurants out there that actually puts effort into serving good bacon. I was very happy with that selection. Pair it with a salad. Doesn't matter which one, they're all really freaking good.  You know what else is cool? The huge to-go section, like a grocery store deli. If you can't sit down for lunch, you can just grab it off the shelf. There's a huge beverage selection as well. It almost makes downtown feel as though it's not a food desert. Prices are totally reasonable, and if their hot dishes are any indication, the quality makes Paradise Bakery look like Subway.   The bad: Flatbreads are kinda lame. Salmon and capers make for a snoozefest with nothing else to really let it shine. The chicken variety tastes like someone really wanted to make a chicken salad sandwich and gave up half way through. I wouldn't go for these.   the ugly: Nope, there is none. The worst I can say about The Corner is that only the majority of what they serve is good. Don't expect anything adventurous for your palate here, but rather the classics done correctly, and you'll leave satisfied. If I'm ever in the area for lunch, this is on the top of my list.

Look, let's not lie to ourselves...a good, hefty quesadilla is a hearty meal that'll put you into a food coma. Queso Good allows you to eat this on the go, but be forewarned...it gets messy! There are about 10 varieties to choose from, but know they all have one thing in common. They're HUGE. This could be two separate meals, but anything is single-serving if you're hungry enough! ;-)  I opted for the "pork-a-dilla", stuffed with guacamole, roasted pork, a touch of sour cream, and chorizo. While the tortilla was much too buttery for me, I immediately gorged on the gigantic meal, with the messy contents spilling out into my little basket. Fortunately, they give you a side of tortilla chips to scoop up every bit of goodness. Be sure to pour some of their tasty green salsa over that.  Some say "you are what you eat", and I definitely felt like a pig after this meal. I'm not proud of myself--it was probably like a million calories. But I DID feel satisfied for the low, low price of about $8.50, and that's why I'm a fan.

Every college student's paradise. Not a college student? Fine, but you'll still love this place. Star is by far the best liquor store I've ever seen. It's not that big, but every square inch is packed with what you need to get the party started.  One wall is lined with craft beer. You can pick up a six pack of well known microbrews and local beers. There are also individual bottles of Rogue, and some other stuff that'll knock you off your feet.  There's an extensive liquor selection, too. Everything I could ask for, and lots I've never even heard of is behind the counter, and at very competitive prices when compared to larger chains like BevMo and Total Wine.   Speaking of wine, Star has a nice rack. I didn't bother to check them (sadly, no one besides myself enjoys wine at parties), but I did take note of the sake lined up on top. There were even some sake bomb kits! Amazing.  I also love the freezer dedicated to munchies (like...every brand of frozen pizza), and the separate freezer just for Jagermeister!  Telling you any more about this place would require me to put my liver in harm's way. It fears this store.

I have no clue how so many restaurants can fail in a spot with so much traffic. Perhaps Paz's predecessors had proven too pretentious to last in what I feel is one of the few safe havens of downtown...a down-to-earth place that stands opposed to pricier options that take themselves too seriously.   Basically, the concept is to grab cheap grub and get liquored up while you socialize with fellow twentysomethings. It's fun. There's so much space outside for ping pong...and I'm not sure what else, but it reminds me of a recreation center from my childhood.   And that's why I rate it so highly. I actually believe the quality of the atmosphere eclipses the food. It's not that I dislike or anything. The carne asada was cooked correctly. The pork belly was by no means greasy. In fact, it was nicely crisped, and the texture was perfect. My problem is that they don't season the meat. Ideally, it should be able to stand on its own, and juxtapose with other ingredients. In this instance, Paz relies on the toppings alone to let the dish shine. The relish on my taco was admittedly tasty. But in the burrito (you can order tortas as burritos. Cool, right?) I was sometimes met with only the flavor of unseasoned steak and unseasoned avocado. Like the forgettable queso, it was alleviated by the salsa, which is admittedly better than almost any Tex Mex spot I've been to.   As for the drinks, they look interesting, and I'm sure somebody somewhere will stop taking advantage of the $3 margaritas to get them. Like the food, you will have minor complaints, and then realize you're paying a ridiculously low price and decide it wasn't so bad at all after you left satisfied.   There's still definitely room for improvement here at Paz. The building feels empty, with lots of underutilized space.  And with throngs of patrons walking around and socializing both indoors and outdoors, it feels too casual to be this sit-down, full-service establishment. It's OK to concede this is fast casual food, and treat it more like a bar. Your menu is totally small enough, and it makes the canned refried beans more forgivable. I'm sure they'll figure it out, but for now, I can dig this. 3.5 stars, rounded up for style points.

I keep giving Paz more chances, but it's the same story every time. The food is really mediocre, and only carries substantial flavor when doused in salsa or cheese. They still think ingredients like plain, canned beans are acceptable in a city with extraordinary burritos on every corner. There are a couple of decent tacos, but that's it.   All of their tequila-based drinks taste the same. One Love margarita tastes like a frozen house margarita. Agave bramble tastes like...well a few blackberries in a house margarita. I can only drink the groovy, $3 margaritas so many times before I go nuts from the monotony! I'd switch it up with beer if their beer selection weren't so boring.   By the way, good luck getting drinks if there's a show. You really think two bartenders can handle all the people outside? Get freaking real.   Can we all just admit that Paz is by no means a good restaurant? We're only coming here for the events, right? Never do I ever say "Hey Paz sounds great for food right now!" It's more like "oh, x artsy event is utilizing this space, may as well kill two birds with one stone". RoRo is short on patio space, so everyone flocks here for the atmosphere and large group seating, and that's cool. It is certainly aesthetic, but everything on the block is.   There are better places for bargain cocktails.   You (will) know in your heart the food leaves you unsatisfied.   If there's something quirky going on here, I'm still down. I can keep my cool here with my friends for a couple hours. Then it's off to a place that doesn't squander so much potential.

There are tons and tons of sports bars in the northwest valley, so it's important that each one does something to stand out. Came here Saturday night excited to try something new. I feel that several years ago, this area would be bustling with twentysomethings from ASU West, but it's died down quite a bit.   Where'd everyone go?  It was 11pm, but there was no music, and almost no one but a group of hicks who treated the bartender as if they'd never interacted with a woman before in their lives. Was annoying to hear nothing but sexist banter, so I tuned them out while she served up items from the modest draft selection, ranging from about $2-$4 .50(plus tax). The patio is very minimal, and not exactly ideal for fostering a social environment because it's so small. But at least my friends won't have to awkwardly stand in front of the building to light up a stogie.   This seems to be everyone's day drinking spot. There are a LOT of TVs, all conveniently placed. During the day, they've got quite a menu as well, but I won't hold my breath when a very rough looking gentleman described it as being "ok food if you're drunk, maybe". I'm also reading something about a kids' menu, and I'm not excited about the idea of little runts hanging around while I try to catch the game. It'll get a second chance when I meet up with a bunch of friends, but I don't really think this is a place I could have fun. At least drinks are cheap, and the bartender I had was very gosh darn cool.

Summary: In a plaza that has seen much better establishments fail, it is a cosmic injustice that a bar & grill like this can exist for so long.   As the rest of the far west continues to develop their own unique options, some argue Park(e) West is struggling to maintain relevancy. Establishments from several years ago have already packed their bags. And while it's fortunate other restaurateurs are attempting to upcycle these spaces into something more worthwhile, I'm afraid this could join the long list of failed projects.   Cabin used to be Sandbar. They kept the outdoor bar and the large patio, but traded the sand for more wooden fixtures. Beyond that, literally nothing else was invested in atmosphere.That's not something I'll get riled up over, but I just have to point out that not trying is really a reoccurring theme here.   The menu doesn't really excite me. They boast "whiskey & grill" in the name, but if it weren't for their website, I'd never known they had an expansive whiskey selection. There were no advertisements for it, and I hadn't seen it on a physical menu. In fact, options for their signature drinks or craft beer bottles were never visible to me. That is a problem.   As for food, the menu seems to be really big on a variety of tacos and steaks. I went with a classic pub favorite--the calamari. The familiar chili sauce it came with indicates the menu does borrow from its predecessor. But...this was the worst calamari I'd had--they looked and tasted like just plain fish sticks TBH. I couldn't even finish half, and after sampling it themselves, my friends were in no hurry to indulge either. Yikes! When incredibly simple dishes are terrible, what confidence can you have for the product of actual creativity in the kitchen?  There are plenty of decent dining options nearby, and I wasn't really going there for the food, so this isn't even what gets me the most. The service here is just absolutely flat out terrible. Despite having several tables reserved for about 20 people, any servers were done for the night well over an hour before the kitchen closed. This led to quite a few of us waiting around awkwardly and empty handed, never being asked so much as what we wanted to drink. I had to request a menu.  After spending a few more hours here between my visits, I see why it's all moving so slow. Despite dozens of customers, Cabin tries its hardest to rely on one bartender doing all the work. The barbacks don't ease the workload by handling the simple tasks, like fetching beers or cleaning up. So...what are they doing? They chill out and play beer pong with security and customers for most of their shift. I am not the first reviewer to notice this. And don't get me wrong, I appreciate a laid-back work environment, and I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but management at some point needs to understand that it can *not* come at the expense of the customer experience. Even worse, it looks terrible to have the women (which AFAIK all their bartenders are) busting their asses while the guys literally play around through their entire shift. Slobs.   In the end, the only bright spot here was the bartender during my first visit in early May. Despite being inundated with work, she was positive the entire time, looked like she cared, and wasn't being a jerk--all while having the misfortune of working on her birthday. She's too good for this place. I hope she reads this review, realizes this is a sinking ship, and gets out before it's too late.   I have absolutely no reason to return.

Oh heavens! You're sporting a "Got Vokda?" slogan. You market yourself as a Polish restaurant, yes, but before that a craft cocktail bar specializing in vodka.   You use Sobieski in the majority of your cocktails. What the actual heck? Nothing small-batch. Not even something a little upscale. You use vodka that would only even pass as mid-shelf at a freaking Wal-Mart, but charge the same prices as places like Blue Hound or the rest of this city's premier watering holes.  My "Napolean Complex" tasted like rubbing alcohol. The alleged absinthe was not noticeable. It was icky all the way down. The "Cactus Milk" I tried tasted like someone panicked about not being able to fill the glass with ingredients that mattered, and topped it off with way too much soda water. It was diluted. If you're gonna take forever to get these drinks to us, make them with care! Or at least, better ingredients.  On the way out, we learned they don't take AMEX. Yes, in the 2010s. In a neighborhood in which we can be chauffeured about using smartphones, and bars are still unable to take certain cards. How gauche.   So yeah, this place is aesthetic. It looks and feels cooler than it actually is. The workers appear sharp. That's nice. I didn't try the pierogies, and perhaps I missed out. There are plenty of other Polish restaurants I can enjoy these in. As a bar, this messes up on a very fundamental level. If I'm going to splurge on my drinks, I'd be better served virtually anywhere else within a two-mile radius, so this will go in the books as a rare one-star review.

I've never been to one of these cool conveyor belt places before. With a clientele that clearly overlapped with Golden Corral's, and patrons cycling out almost as fast as the food, I was skeptical. Once I was seated, I was hesitant to grab anything. The concept was so new to me! There were so many choices, I had an overload.   I think this is a very good format for those wanting to try a vast variety of sushi and a well-balanced meal. Start out with a seaweed salad for $1.75, move on to a few 3-4 piece rolls of decent quality for $3.25 each (look out for good specials on nigiri!), and finish off the night with something like a generous piece of cheesecake for another $2.25. You'll be more than satisfied for around 20 bucks.   I think this is also a good format if you wanna be a n00b and gorge yourself on the oversupply of California roll variations for just over 2 bucks a pop. Just go nuts, you'll be up to your eyeballs in surimi and spicy mayo in no time. I think too many of the rolls are essentially the same.   What I don't think this is good for is for anyone looking for heaping portions of good quality sushi. For the price of 2-3 premium plates, you could just go to a traditional sushi bar and get something better. I'd say that's about the limitation of this place.   Overall, this is a fast and fun dinner option for casual customers. It's a great option to dine on cheap rolls. It's not-so-good for those with really high standards (for either quality or creativity). Just...do it the way I do it and you'll be happy.

Venturing out to Goodyear can be a bit daunting. It's a long drive. Everything is soooo far apart! Oregano's might be the best restaurant out here, so it's no wonder it was impossible to get into on a Sunday afternoon.   We started out with a wait of about 20 minutes. OMG the wait is killer when there's nothing nearby to wait in, but between the nice weather and host handing out pizza samples, it was still alright.   Finally made it in, and I must say I liked it! The view from the inside was very nice. They have so many staff members that I never felt like I was forgotten about. My pizza was made very skillfully, and fortunately didn't even take a whole 45 minutes. I thought this would be a pretty weak location, but it ended up proving more desirable than my usual in CenPho. Would recommend...I mean, if you actually have to be out here for some reason.

Goodness gracious! Although I could eat many slices every day, I have to admit that Phoenix is becoming saturated with all these PIZZA NAPOLETANA places vying for the attention of a small foodie population. But while most of these joints are locales to see and be seen, Forno 301 simply cares about loving life and making good food.   The menu is VERY simple. You've got your choice between red and white wine, like 3 different cocktails, and very few varieties of pizza. I guess it's more easily understood as the In 'n' Out model, where by limiting choices you can really excel at a few things.   So I sipped on a very reasonably priced aperol, gin, and grapefruit mix (I love bitter! Legit!) and watched them place an order in the oven. The owners are very talkative, and come off as some of the most genuinely kind individuals I've ever seen run a restaurant. I wonder how they ended up here, of all places?   When our pizza arrived, I was excited, but had reservations. Quite frankly, I can describe it most accurately as "Just one notch below the top pizzas in the valley, but at a significantly lower price that makes the compromise easy to swallow". I mean, the sausage was amazing, but whyyyy are the mushrooms canned? The sauce also seems canned, albeit the best canned sauce money can buy. The mozzarella tasted pretty good, but had a texture suspiciously on the waxy side. I am by no means saying I didn't enjoy my meal, but that you should lower your expectations from mind-blowing to above-average before you come here. Instead of a 5-star pizza at a 5-star price, it's a 4-star pizza at a 3-star price. It works.   "Every time you come, I will teach you a new word in Italian" said the tall gentleman with a thick accent as I prepared to leave. And even though word he taught me (Quick! What's Italian for "Good bye"?) is already forgotten, the pizza was not...guess I'll have an excuse to come back, and hopefully try a variety of pie even better than what I had before.

I'm gonna jump on the hype train and say this place is hella fun, and serves a quality product at prices that will make your eyes widen in disbelief. Like seriously, you can knock down some beers, and especially mixed beverages without a dent in your wallet.   The seating is almost exclusively long tables, with comfy booths lining one wall. When weather permits, the outdoor canopy is pretty neat, especially since all the couches are new.   They pride themselves in a full menu as well, and while yours truly hasn't had it yet, I've noticed they do appear to partake in Taco Tuesday, where you can get your hands on some hard-shelled snacks. Overall, I like it a lot...it's a dive that doesn't realize it's a dive. My only concern is the bit of an identity crisis it's having. The sound system is weak, it's too brightly lit, and there's virtually no standing room, so it feels like a straight up restaurant despite the jukebox and billiard tables. As a result, The Glass House comes across as a place I really can't recommend for spending an entire weekend night, but rather as a welcome destination for knocking a couple back after work.

This review is gonna be really long, so the short version is this: There's rad music, groovy games, a kitchen, and a baller cocktail menu. If you're browsing the mobile app and you're nearby, you need to drop in. Like, now.   Still with me? OK, here are the details...  There is no place in Phoenix I will defend as much as Valley Bar. Seriously, it's my litmus test for whether or not I'm going to like your reviews--give this gem less than five stars, and I'll take everything you write with a grain of salt.   It's just that good.  It's an eclectic establishment with the quintessential Phoenix vibe--artsy and unassuming, attracting clientele from gruff hipsters looking for indie shows, to the all dolled-up in five inch heels treating this like a club, to businessmen and politicians coming in wearing full suits.  I met Congressman Ruben Gallego while drinking a Kate + Ruben. He didn't seem amused when I said "Hey there's a drink named after you amirite?"   On another evening, I shook hands with mayor Greg Stanton while drinking a Stanton. Groovy, right?   I keep ordering my favorite cocktail--The McCain--but the old 'Maverick' is yet to show up! Bummer, but at least I can revel in the sweet, smoky, spicy goodness of mezcal, citrus, and a mouthwatering bite from an ancho chili liquor. At $8 a pop, these craft cocktails really are a steal, and the Rose Room, the lounge they're served in, is so comfortable and dimly lit you'll feel you've stumbled into a much more expensive environment.  If you're hungry, take advantage of the kitchen run by Short Leash hot dogs, and have a seat in one of the booths. Like every other table here, it's illuminated by real candles, lending an intimate feel. We haven't invented a love potion quite yet, but let me tell you right now that having a chat and playing one of their many board games over a glass of wine will certainly suffice. Just down the hall will be a cool game room with pool tables, ski-ball, and a couple of awesome arcade games.   It's important to remember that above all, this is a music venue! Emphasis on medium-sized indie shows, but they have stellar DJ sets. My favorite is Blunt Club, the hip hop night that brings the best Thursday night fun I've had in the valley. Some of the local bands are especially great, and tons of fun.   This is up there with my favorite spots in Phoenix, but of course there will be some growing pains. This place is just so gosh darn popular, it's near impossible to get in during prime time. I have waited 20 minutes for this, something I won't do for any other establishment. It can get terribly busy on Saturday--I've heard of hour-long lines close to midnight! Be prepared for standing room only! Also, keep in mind some shows/sets that used to be free now carry a charge, and this will be the rare time I hope entry gets more expensive so as to thin down the line a bit.   I can easily spend several hours here without getting bored. It's fun, affordable, hip...I just do not have enough good words.   GET IN

It's a Dutch Bros clone.  It is sooooo a DB clone.   But when it's got a decent product, and even more accessible hours, is that honestly a bad thing?  I mean sure, the baristas haven't yet quite nailed the matching brand of over-the-top enthusiasm, but they try! They're cool. And the beverages they've made for me so far haven't been half bad, especially with the 'white coffee' that kept me up for hours.   (I thought it was unique to this place, but it turns out DB did that first as well)  I really set low expectations, and they delivered. I trust this place to get a good, sugary mixed beverage or an OK black coffee in a grab-and-go location. Sure, I think it's weird that they copied everything except combinations of flavored syrups in signature beverages. I think they should continue to develop themselves and create something no one else in the area has. It's a large suburbia with virtually no competition from other independent operations, so please take risks! Add something a little out of the ordinary to such a boring corner!   Until then, it might sound like I dislike this place, but I know I can trust them to make me good drinks. And that's what matters most! Support small businesses and make this your spot in the northwest valley. =)

It's really just the most basic venue I've seen for years in this town. Sound system is average. Drink selection and prices are average. It's very small, narrow, and flat, so if you're not super tall like yours truly, it's highly likely you'll have a tough time viewing the action.  Shows appear to be booked sparsely, and are just affordable, local acts. I like those, and will probably be forced back from time to time to see one. I guess my biggest problem is that this place has no personality, no character, no SOUL. Just an air conditioned room with canned beer. Easily forgettable, and I can find what Rebel offers in way cooler corners of the valley.

I love gin! But I had never heard of or seen Hendrick's before, so it was exciting to have a little tasting party centered around it.   After sitting through a 20-minute lecture on the history of the product, and how it's made (everyone was gradually buzzing off the complimentary gin & tonics at the beginning), we received step-by-step instructions on how to make a couple of basic cocktails. I totally loved the cucumber lemonade, and I suppose the blueberry variant was refreshing as well.   By the end of it all, @MixMasterMark (pretty cool brand ambassador) could barely keep our boozed-up crowd under control while explaining the group project: The punch bowl!  In the end, we found ourselves enjoying our creations at the bar of The Gladly. It all felt a little hurried, but this is still a good event that had me sold on a product.

This bar is really bare-bones, but it has the fundamentals of a nice little dance club. Great lights, a couple cool tables, and the space for the DJ is top notch. The sound is kickin', and dancing is mandatory.   It's a bar for ladies who like ladies, and some of my friends had a good time. Everyone was so nice, and I was glad to meet new people.   Drink selection is small, but reasonably priced. Owner was chilling in the back checking things out, and I could tell she cared about making sure everyone was having fun. This is a great example of an overlooked local business filling a cool niche. It wasn't as packed as the neighboring bar for the boys, but I hope some day soon it will be. There's room for it to grow and improve, but it's still fun.

Checked out Happy Hour (4-6) during their soft opening, and they didn't let me down!  Okra brings a unique atmosphere to the midtown area with a combination of Southern comfort food, twists on Italian favorites, and a down-to-earth atmosphere that juxtaposes high quality ingredients with inviting hospitality. They could serve these craft cocktails and eclectic eats in an exclusive, dimly-lit lounge, but instead make it accessible, with its hard rock and sports.   This could be a surprisingly good place to watch college football, just as long as they're not big on the SEC!  I indulged more in the safer side of the respectable cocktail menu. With prices as low as $6 a pop for some of these, it's an hour happier than most. Sazerac was on point. The milk punch was unique and refreshing, although it left me wanting for a little more depth beyond the delicious cognac. I cannot recall the tequila-based treat I enjoyed from the more premium concoctions, but it certainly left a great first impression.  The couple of appetizers I had were cool. This is the only place I've seen this side of the Mississippi rocking fried chicken skins. The honey hot sauce coating them is grand! I tried one of their focaccias, which are really pizzas, and while the ingredients were good, there was a bit of a flavor mismatch. Sweet and salty doesn't work with everything! Additionally, I couldn't imagine ever paying full price for these, as they're up to $14, which would certainly get you something bigger and better elsewhere. No worries, however, as there are lots and lots of options I am sure could please anyone.  I'll be back with a bigger appetite, and some cautious optimism for some twists on classic dishes. Until then, this definitely has my endorsement for a solid day drinking spot.

If you just wanted to show up and pay full price for a couple of food trucks, this event was a-ok and not much of a hassle at all. If you made it here as a Yelp Elite, it was questionable, but bearable after a few free craft brews. I don't even wanna think about suckers who actually purchased the "foodie pass", because they were absolutely ripped off beyond belief.   After taking weeks to have our attendance confirmed, and after leaving us waiting almost an hour by the amphitheater, it was finally time to meet *the* Aspen D. and get started. He's a very charismatic event coordinator who I must extend my sympathies toward before I indulge in the bulk of this review.   It's gonna get ugly.   OK, so let's get past the part where you took forever to confirm our attendance. Let's get past the part where we stood near the amphitheater unsure of ourselves. From the get-go, I was worried our event would be a total disaster! Here are a few warnings we were given:  -Some vendors who previously agreed to participating would be stubborn about giving out samples, but we should flex our elite status to convince them otherwise.   -Some vendors were frustrated from the previous day, and we should expect a level of hostility toward participants not there ordering full entrees.  -To utilize our express/VIP access, we had to simply cut lines and assert we were judges in need of immediate service.   First of all, middle fingers to Raging Cajun BBQ for conveniently "running out" of samples within one hour, despite having plenty of product left. They tried to tell us they weren't participating to begin with, and were the first of many to back out. Absolute liars who are unlikely to see my business in the future.  I also dislike anyone who gave out tiny, weak samples. Customers paid up to $28 for 10 samples + a water or can of soda. That's about $2.50 each, but many of these were one-bite samples on toothpicks. They were mostly the size and quality of a free sample at Costco, and that's being generous. The organizers owe an apology to anyone who paid top dollar to eat like 1/8th of a sausage after waiting in line for 15 minutes. By the way, the drinks constantly ran out, and were never cold.  The "sample village" was bogus as well. HOW DARE YOU inflate the number of vendors we could vote for by having your own people in there handing out store-bought desserts and lunch meat? You didn't even try to hide the boxes!   You oversold the express passes by so much, that many trucks had an express line only. Either I was pissing off actual paying customers by cutting in front of them in the name of Yelp, or was told too bad, so sad, because almost everyone shelled out a few extra bucks for them. BTW it appears only those who purchased tickets from Groupon got actual VIP wristbands.  At the end of the day, the best things I can say about this festival are that vendors were physically present, and that I paid a grand total of $0 to essentially get my drink on and have half a lunch. In the future, please make sure the businesses you're promoting for don't hate you and actively undermine both the value and usefulness of tickets, which were a complete ripoff you should be apologizing for.  I'd be open to going again if you don't oversell VIP passes, which ended up being a ripoff, so that it's not so difficult doing what you sent me here to do. I gave up before using all my tickets. If you made sure there was some standard for samples. If you don't augment vendor count with your own store-bought merchandise.  I had an OK time, but after seeing how many paying customers were screwed, anything short of two stars implies I endorse this level of BS. I do not.

It's a nice concept, even if it's still a little rough around the edges. Hold my nostalgia goggles, I'm about to go in on this one.   Welcome to downtown's first true 'BarCade'! Where getting sloshed takes a bit of a backseat to getting down on groovy games with your friends. It has 40 games in total, mostly fighting and beat-em'-ups, but with a sports game or two as well. Dimly lit, it's got a DJ spinning a balanced rap/indie mix over a great sound system.  I can tell you guys know what's up when it comes to game selection. My favorites include TMNT: Turtles in Time, The Simpsons, Street Fighter II, Street Fighter III Third Strike (RARE! Good job!), and NBA Jam, in which I will absolutely destroy any and all challengers reading this review. Good thing everyone is up for a round; the clientele is nothing short of stellar. Everyone is young and chill. I feel like nerd royalty.   So even though it's small, I must say that as an arcade Cobra is definitely awesome for me. But on the bar side of things, there's much to be desired. Traffic is a bit awkward at times. People were trying to dance, or just mingle in large groups, but the space between machines and the bar isn't a dance floor, it's a walkway! Bummer, but I can't blame them for needing some type of space to get down, and they just might venture next door to get it.   Restrooms are awesome, don't change them.   Seating is a giant pain and a huge fail. There are some stools in the corner, and there are *supposed* to be seats at the bar. But those were all dragged to the machines to use as stands for drinks. The makeshift stands intended for our use feel as though they could topple at any moment. So not only will you stand the entire time (I'm not gonna die or anything, just letting you know), you will be in constant fear of your drink getting knocked over. What, am I supposed to chug in between games?   Furthermore, your bar staff acts like a bunch of amateurs. Although the beer selection is decent and reasonably priced, I can count on one hand places I have had worse cocktails. You tried to be ambitious and trendy, and it hasn't worked yet! My "Dirk the Daring" tasted like mostly vodka with a mild chili syrup. There was not any sort of juice, nor was there a garnish, so I'm not sure where or what the "citrus" was supposed to be. My friend's "Crazy Kong" was more drinkable, but nearly indistinguishable from a whiskey-ginger. Cool banana slice though.  Anyways, my drink was put on the incorrect tab. Your staff looked confused and ready to drop dead from exhaustion by a quarter to one. I struggle to recall seeing a team of bartenders look more stressed! Yes, yes, you are new and there are going to be kinks. These are more than kinks. Please fix them, because I want the moneymaker of your business to run smoothly, and for your facility to prosper.   Overall, I'm excited to bring many, many friends here. I can't wait to drink, kick your ass in a few games, step outside for a food truck, then come back to drink and mingle and kick more ass. Despite its flaws, Cobra is hella fun, and that absolutely outweighs its growing pains.   GET IN.

After battling with loads of picky yelpers, Cobra just leveled up from pretty nifty barcade to premiere night life spot you MUST check out. It's hot stuff. Like, so great you will often be frustrated by your inability to get in.   The concept on the inside is fully realized with original artwork covering everything. Games have their own custom styles added.The lights above the bar are just mesmerizing. It is simply pretty to look at from top to bottom.   The game selection is even better as they expand their collection. Everything from sports to RPGs (think Gauntlet) to side scrollers to even some shooting games. Fighting game selection is superb with Marvel vs Capcom 2, Tekken Tag Tournament and more. It's the best of the 90s, even some early 00s stuff is in there so everyone can find something to play.   ***Be forewarned games are no longer free. I don't have a problem with this, but it is a giant pain in the rear end fighting through a crowd to get tokens, or making sure you've got enough small bills to last a couple hours. Maybe just revert to 'free' games and charge a cover? IDK the solution, but it kinda sours the pace of play, which is the only complaint I have about this place.***  Anyway, the drinks have vastly improved. The beer selection is bringing in more hard-to-find specimens, and the cocktails are good as well. They're not trying to be super fancy, craft cocktails with rare ingredients and double digit prices, but rather common stuff mixed well that'll keep ya partying all night. Be prepared to dance!  And speaking of partying, their DJs are all legit, and their calendar is STACKED with events. Theme nights galore. It's a nerd's absolute dream. It's a fun place by default, and these all put it over the top.   They even know how to be awesome during the day. About every other Sunday, they have some sort of tournament for a particular game, where old-school aficionados can win a little something something. Or you can just chill out and enjoy the bright, airy atmosphere and play some console games at the bar.   There is literally not a bad time to show up here. It is impossible to not have a good time here, either. Easily some of the best nightlife in the valley.

I have literally never gambled anywhere before coming here, but I know what I like, and I've got mixed feelings about this establishment. Yes, I understand the city of Glendale is a party pooper who would rather not allow this place to exist, and as a result, it's been hit hard by the fun police. No booze yet...but it's a stone's throw from two large plazas that have an abundance of it. Security is lazy AF and I'm sure no one would care to stop you from bringing a flask.   It's essentially a giant room filled with slot machines, extremely questionable characters, and unavoidable secondhand from indoor smoking. But it's a no-pressure environment. Where I can get in and out whenever I feel like it. Free valet, but you can park yourself. No entry fee. I don't have to go to the outskirts of town. I appreciate these little things. While I feel as though it's great for entry-level individuals like myself, it's really too bare-bones to plan your night around it. This will never be much more than a quick excursion. I'm sure I'll be back, but can I really spend more than an hour in front of haze and flashing lights?

The surface of Phoenix right now is burning hot, crowded, and worst of all, too mainstream. So figuratively, and literally, a friend and I decided to go underground and explore a little-known watering hole worthy of all the rage.  From the outside, it bears similarity to that *other* bar in an alley with red light marking its presence. The exteriors are so identical newcomers, who would be delighted in either locale, could easily confuse them.   But Melinda's is distinguished by its identity as a speakeasy. The location isn't loudly advertised. The hours are incredibly limited. There is no consistent menu. And the bar itself is hidden...well hidden. The doorman will be happen to acquaint you with the establishment, warning there are no beers, no wines, and that this is a cash only establishment.  So after a trek downstairs, we found ourselves in a long, narrow hallway adorned with classy furniture, and illuminated with red light as faint as the soft music setting the mood. It's great for group seating, where crews of 4-6 people could easily make themselves comfortable in several spots throughout the room. Other than that, you'll be standing, which is a-ok. Everyone who sets foot here feels like they're in on some secret. Like they belong to a clandestine group of mixologist appreciation. And when everyone feels a common trait--that they recognize they too enjoy drinking off the beaten path--they're more likely to interact. You will meet new faces here and you will share laughs between sips of some of the finest concoctions the valley has to offer.   The small, rotating menu is top notch, and I must assert made with what seem to be high quality ingredients. My first mix, of which I forget the name, featured Gin (do I taste Hendrick's, good sir?) and chartreuse. Incredible and refreshing.   The bar here is very minimalist. It would appear much of the ingredients are prepared in advance upstairs (in the hotel), and simply brought in for the finishing touches. There's little effort on part of the bartenders in front of you, and those who consider flair as integral to experiencing craft cocktails may find themselves dissuaded. I myself was initially turned off by the idea of paying $13 bucks for these, but I changed my tune because of how exceptional they are, and how nice the final presentation actually is. The glassware is the best I've had anywhere--it's so heavy and intricate it makes one feel as though they've arrived at a formal event. Great, fresh garnishes as well remind you this is not a place for scrubs.  My second cocktail, the Strawberry Shrub, is my new favorite, and one that I hope returns. Made with white rum, strawberry puree, and other items I cannot recall, it tasted so *fresh* and so...*real* I can't wait to have it again! Complex, not too sweet, and with the subtle burn of fine liquors is exactly what I want, and they deliver.   Sorely missed will be the drink I didn't get to in time. The "restart", a blend of Patron XO and cold-brew coffee. I have no regrets, as the young ladies across the hall who complained about "coming down" needed it much more than I. But our coffee shortage portended a precipitous decline in the rest of the menu! A couple more of our beloved selections vanished shortly thereafter. It was no later than 12:30. Too early, right? I mean, certainly, they're obligated to replenish and keep the night going!   With a shrug and a smile, the bartender says "Well...when they're gone, they're gone!" The smug bastard. Oh, the nerve! But of course, he can get away with this. He SHOULD be so blasé, as this is a true speakeasy. An easily overlooked space well utilized, secretive, shady, and with inconsistent hours. For all I know, it functions less than ten hours a week. But while it's open...WOW, it's so sweet.   Still unready for my night to end, I climbed the cold, metal stairs back up to the surface. Passing the new groups of friends that emerged. Passing the ladies in heels needing help back up. Stepping over the ladies voraciously making out for a Snapchat clip and a small audience. Everyone was having a blast. Perhaps, too much so. But that's what going underground will do to you. Don't count on Melinda's to function as the be-all, end-all locale to spend your whole night in. Like all great things in life, it is evanescent. It will end too soon. Still, I cannot recommend enough that you drop by, that you too learn it's one of the finer things in life, and you will pursue such outstanding beverages with as much fervor as I.

Asian Garden is a real groovy concept. The most common dishes are ordered cafeteria-style. They're already made and ready to go, at the low low price of $7.50 for a whopping 3-entree plate.   I wasn't in the hurry, and I was there rather late, my dining companion and I ordered some stuff to go. First, of course was my usual sesame chicken, which they loaded up with garlic! Over 12 hours later, I still am glad I don't have a date today. :-p   The vegetarian, or even vegan options are where I think this place shines. The #44 (some type of flat noodles with vegetables) was delicious, and perhaps next time I'll ask for it spicy. My vegetarian dining companion was delighted to see vegetarian egg rolls, as virtually every other place puts some type of meat in theirs.   Service was courteous, and the manager was very delighted to show us some unique recommendations. I'm coming back for sure.   PS--if you live nearby, they deliver!

What's better than trying a new restaurant? Trying it with your fellow esteemed yelpers! Supper at Sauce was a wonderful treat that reinforces the obvious--it's sweet to be elite!  If you weren't here, be jealous, as our CM Hailey organized yet another stellar summer event.   We started off with some great bruschetta. I was partial to the variety with goat cheese, but the caprese and meatball apps were some great hits.   Then, there was so much salad I don't think we were capable of going through it all! The variety with blue cheese and chicken was delicious. I wanted to try the others, but I had to save room for the main course.   The pizza was pretty good. The lasagna pizza was...unique, which I enjoyed, but where it really shined was the variety with fontina. It's one of the best cheese pizzas I've had in the valley.   For dessert, we shared a 'pizzookie' (cookie prepared in a small pizza dish) while the raffle winners were announced. I was so delighted to get my very own Yelp swag bag!   I had tons of fun laughing with familiar yelpers, and even had the surprise of seeing familiar faces only known through talk. My only regret is that I didn't stop and meet more of you...but there's always next time, right? =)
