We heard a lot about this place and were excited to try it but once we were there we couldn't wait to leave. I don't like very spicy food and everything on the menu had a chili pepper next to the name. There were maybe two items without the chili pepper. We ordered anyway because my boyfriend loves spicy food and we were already seated. My blue corn? tamale was inedible, my rice was a mix of newly cooked and old, dry, hard rice as is they scraped it off an old pan and mixed it in with the new. The carne adovada was nondescript. We left most of our food on our plates and still left with heartburn from the overbearing spice.

Great deals on taco Tuesday. Tacos were tasty.   But all you really need to know is this: They mix lettuce into their guac to make it fill up the cup it's served in.   I was appalled.

get the butchers plate? I want to say thats what its called, I dont think its on the menu. but its a platter of all sorts of yummy things that they are serving that day like meats and cheeses and olives and spreads.  they also dont have sangria on their menu but they'll make it for you and its pretty tasty.   most importantly though is order a side of olive oil with whatever you get (for pizza crust, bread, etc.) Its literally heaven-sent. I would bathe in it.

Great beer selection.. Awesome patio. The portabello mushroom sandwich was fantastic. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good beer and a casual place to hang out. Food menu isn't extensive but it's all delicious!
