I have been going to this place for years and it is now my go-to neighborhood bar.  Food is great, they have free poker and Casey is the best karoake host!  Staff is very friendly and they have darts, pool and a internet jukebox.   If you go, look for the good-looking guy at the bar and say, "Hi."

This place is a joke...I own an auto repair shop and used these guys for the first time.  Never again!  I'm still redoing stuff that they did.  Had them rebuild a 1997 Ford Explorer 4.0.  They didnt time the camshaft properly on the passenger side cylinder head so I had to take it apart and redo it.  Back in my shop for an upper oilpan leak that they also screwed up.  When I called them on it, it was "bring them the engine" (Not happening) or tow the truck back at my expense.  Seriously...F them and never again!

There Once Was a Bar Named "The Tav"... Positioned On 19th Ave... I Thought It Said "Tay"... But Went Anyway... And Really Was Glad That I Had!
