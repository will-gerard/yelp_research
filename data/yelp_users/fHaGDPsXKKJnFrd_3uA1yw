Stumbled upon this place by accident. Not a coffee drinker but their selection of iced teas was great and really enjoyed the one I chose. Great ambience and fun hangout. It's cold inside so bring a jacket. Also, how do I say this nicely...it needs a good cleaning and organization. It is kinda dumpy looking and in this day and age...that is just as important as the quality of the product you sell. It's everything one loves about a coffee shop but this one needs some investment in refreshed remodeling soon.

Nothing more painful than trying to find a car mechanic you can trust. I've been coming to Oasis for about 3 years now and each time I've taken my car in for service, they have done a thorough job at informing me of my car's necessary repairs, but also telling me what can wait and what is more urgent. I like that approach and have never felt I've been taken advantage of. The prices have always been fair and thoroughly explained. Happy to recommend this place.

After about 6 visits, I wanted to take the time to review this place. Every time I have been in, the experience has been stellar. The staff has always been friendly. This place has been packed with a line outside the door but I still feel they took the time to listen to my other and made it as best as if it were their first order of the day. In addition to great service, the pizza is amazing. The toppings for the pizza are so fresh. The pizza has always come out perfect. A nice thin crisp but not crunchy crust. You can taste the fire roasted flavor in every bite. And for the fifth star I'm giving them, the price. It's a very reasonable $7 for a pizza. I have brought several friends and family members for a meal and every experience has been awesome. I love having a great place to recommend to people. Keep up the great work and high quality Fired Pie!!!

I have to give Burger 21 only two stars for a couple of reasons. First, service. Despite there being at least 15 staff members, service was slow. My friends order came out 11 minutes before mine did. The owner clearly saw that we had been waiting a while for the second burger, but he just asked a staff member to check on it rather than find out himself. It wasn't busy as we went around 1:30 pm. Second reason I am disappointed was I ordered my burger without cheese. When my order finally came out, it was clear they scraped off the cheese. I could still see melted cheese on it that had been wiped off. It could have been they reused the same bun and toppings and made a new burger patty, hence the long wait...but either way there was cheese on part of it, then wiped off. I did inform the owner who apologized and gave me a $5 off coupon for my next visit. For a burger that was $8 without fries, this was somewhat insulting especially after he informed me the cook made a new burger. Either I was lying or he was. They offered to make me a new one but I wasn't wanting to wait another 15 minutes. After all was said and done, I ate less than about half the burger as it was very soggy and I was ready to just leave. The $5 coupon isn't enough incentive to get me to try it again. That's a shame as I was hoping it would be a great neighborhood joint like Fired Pie next door is.
