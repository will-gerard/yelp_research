Yuck! The chips were okay. Some of them were straight white. Im not sure if they're not cooked or what but they were chewy and not good. The salsa was alright too. Not bad. I ordered a beef tostada and a beef taco. I took one bite of the tostada and couldn't take another. So gross. The beans were nasty. Not the refried beans im used to. I could have bought a can of Rosarita and been better off. Also, Idk what it was but something on there was really mushy. Almost a fish consistency actually. I was grossed out. The taco was OKAY...but I had about two bites of that as well...I thought I was getting ground beef but it was shredded. I gave the plate back and they didn't charge me for it. I also tried the chicken in my boyfriends enchilada and that was disgusting as well. I wanted to spit it out but i just dealt with it. He didn't like anything on his plate but the chicken inside of the enchilada. Sauce was gross, etc. I'm not going to come back. Super friendly staff though!! Great service and if you like mariachi bands they're live every Friday night.

I got a gel manicure here and It looked great the first day. 3 days later my pointer finger began chipping. One day after that my thumb began chipping. I went in the next day to get them fixed. Two days after that my other pointer finger began chipping and so did middle finger. These nails did not even last a week ....and they were $25! I won't be coming back. I don't have time to keep getting my nails fixed. I had to wait an hour and a half to be seen for a 5-10 min process...the pedicure i got there has lasted though...no complaints there

I wish I would have read the reviews before coming here. What everyone else said is true. There are scam artisits who work here. Here's my story:   I needed a new wheel bearing for my tire (just one) and an alignment. I had been to a couple different places and gotten quotes and most places seemed to price match and make it cheaper for me. Big O Tires gave me the best deal at $243 for both services, all taxes included. John gave me an ASU discount even though I told him I didn't go there because he was really trying to be competitive so I appreciated that. I went in the same day that I called over the phone for a quote (last Friday) and waited about 2 and a half hours for my service to be done. It was almost 6 o clock at this point and John comes out to tell me that he can't finish the work. He can't get the wheel bearing separated from the hub so he needs to replace the entire hub. WTF were you doing for 2 1/2 hours then??  He asks if he can keep my car overnight and finish it on Saturday. I said no because I have work so we arrange for me to come in on Monday.  John told me that he would not charge anything for the hub being replaced and I would still pay the same price he quoted me before. So I said okay it's only two days I'll just wait...Over the weekend the wheel bearing became TWICE AS LOUD as it ever was. I thought my tire was going to fall off. I was really scared at this point because I'm pregnant and would not want to get into a car accident. I called John on Saturday and told him that my tire was making crazy loud noises, worse than ever before. I asked if everything was okay and did he put my bearing back on right because it sounds terrible. He said that he "messed up" the bearing when he was trying to get it off and that's why it sounds worse. So I was driving on a doubly F'ed up wheel bearing now. Which is dangerous and can really mess up my two week old tires. I brushed this off because in two short days I was getting all new parts anyway.   Monday comes around and I take my car in again and wait another 2 1/2 hours. I was across the street at Applebee's when John called me to tell me my car was ready. He also said he was going to have no charge me an extra $177 for parts and labor for the hub assembly. He said today he still had a hard time separating it from the wheel bearing and so he needed another part for it and he had to charge me labor for that. REAL CONVENIENT that he tells me once I have to come to pay right??  Well I yelled at him for wasting my time on Friday and for not giving me an advance notice of the charges. I told him I was NOT paying the extra fee he mentioned because on Friday he told me this service would not cost me any money. He tried to haggle with me saying okay fine I'll pay the parts, you just pay  the labor, fair enough? I said hell no you lied to me. I told him I was not paying any more than the $243 he quoted me. So then he said okay, well with taxes and everything it comes to $265. I said uhhhh NO it doesn't I specifically asked you over the phone what the out the door price would be. I would never have come to this place if I knew it was going to be more money and that I had to come in TWICE just to be disrespected and treated like I'm an F'in idiot. He  tried to pull a fast one and  it did  not work. He's lucky I only yelled at him over the phone from Applebee's. DO NOT GO HERE.

AJ  was my awesome server when I came in for lunch around 1:30. He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I'll come back just because I received such great service from him.   Wings and slice lunch special was on point too. Love their pizza

Breakfast over at 11. I ordered the chimi lunch special. I liked it! The salsa bar is plentiful and tasty. I liked them on the chips and chimis. Cheap. I paid like $6 for the chimi special (no drink though). Would probably come again. Better than Brush fire Tacos on thunderbird.

I'm sitting here stuffing my face with the rolled tacos supreme. Why didn't anyone think of this sooner? They are really really good. I was over at the dealership and looked on Yelp to find somewhere to pick up some food. I saw that this place only had 4 reviews, and Filibertos had 23. I think Fili's is...meh so I tried here instead. I was hoping for a drive thru, and got one. Can't rate it any higher because this is the only menu item I've tried. Very delicious though!

This place sucked. Ordered the family meal for delivery. Got the orange chicken, Hunan beef, and chicken chow mien. The orange chicken was the worst I've ever had. Not crispy or breaded. Just soggy. Really, all of it sucked except the rice. But I ate it. Egg rolls were okay and the crab puffs were great but tiny. I won't order again. I only did because there was a flyer on our door. Great price for the meal tho.

I would come here again for sure! I had an enchilada and a taco and both were really good. I went here based on other peoples reviews and I was very happy. Awesome horchata as well ! :)

I don't understand all of the hype. I had lamb vindaloo and it was meh. Just meat and potatoes. I might be willing to go back and try something different, because 800 Yelp reviewers can't all be wrong. But if I went here without seeing the awesome reviews, I would probably never return. I was expecting something spectacular and was disappointed. The service was also extremely slow. The waitress barely came around and that always makes the experience suck.

Fish tacos were awesome. The refried beans were bland and kinda gross. The rice was decent. I'll come back again but I won't order beans.

I've only ordered one thing on the menu...and that's the House Style frittata. It's amazing. That's why I kept ordering it. I've also had the Breakfast Buzz shake minus the peanut butter and that was also great.   One thing that's weird about the drive thru is that they walk up to you and ask what you want. Like, before you've seen a menu. Idk what i want yet dude ! If you ask, they give you a menu, but I just think that that's weird. There's probably a small percentage of people who know what they want before looking at a menu. So give me one first, then ask later...anyway not a big deal.

Open until 8pm during the week. The hours up top are incorrect.   First time here and I order the salmon melt on ciabatta white. It was freakin awesome. Even better with Tapatio on it. Will return for sure. It had avocado, Cajun sauce, lettuce, tomato, and really good salmon. I got It without raw onions.

Not your regular sandwich place. Last time i was here the cashier recommended I try the Cajun crab cake, and I opted for the salmon instead. This time I took her up on it and OMG. It to die for. I really didn't expect for a crab cake sandwich to be good. And when the lady was making it i was regretting it lol. But I'm glad I stuck it out.   The Caribbean spice smoothie also sounds weird but is really really good ! I'm so glad they don't have unoriginal flavors of anything here.  Even the potato salad was better than most.

I live about 20 minutes away from this location in Peoria, but I don't mind the drive because Adrianna always takes care of me. She's constantly being sweet and friendly, and I like a bartender who I can conversate  with.   For example, I was with a friend at the bar when we both had to go to the bathroom. I walked away quickly and when I returned she had my purse behind the bar. She made my friend give it to her so she could watch it while we were away! How sweet.

Suuuuper slow service. Bruschetta was good, but it took 34 min. Yes I timed it. I looked at the time stamp from my bar receipt. ..disappointed.  Got a slice too even though it looked old. Asked the server how old and he said a couple hours but it tasted days old. QT has better pizza. And it took about 6 min to get a slice after I asked the waiter who was standing right at the thing with all of the slices in it..for real we were right there.    It took 1 full hour for me by myself to get everything and go. And I ate everything in 5 min or less !  I hate writing bad reviews, but wow. Come on guys !   2 stars instead of 1 because the bruschetta was good.

Great gyros and an awesome philly cheesesteak. I don't really like white cheese, but that was my only choice for this sandwich, and it was so good ! It was an American Swiss and it blended well with the flavors of the sandwich. Will order again

I expected this to be a nice sit down place, but it was more or less fast Italian food. I ordered the small pasta and meatballs only to find out there was only ONE meatball..that kinda sucks. The one meatball wasn't that good anyway so maybe it was for the best. It came with free bread that is hard as a rock. When you order take out they give you a free drink while you're waiting. I didn't wait long, under 10 minutes. There was nothing too terrible about the pasta, but it was nothing special. I probably could've made it better though. I should've gone to Olive Garden across the street.

I had the #1 which is a Lamb Gyro. The lamb was seasoned so deliciously! Seriously, it was really good. Most Greek places I've been to are a disappointment, so I never really consider them as a choice for dining out. However, I was in the area and decided to stop in. This place has probably the best Gyros I've ever had. Only 4 stars since I've only tried one thing on the menu. Ill be back since I live just next door though!

Since my first review I've had the lamb gyro like 3 more times (at least), plus the chicken gyro. I like the lamb better. I've also had the Greek fries a couple times and those are pretty good too. This last visit I tried the Italian beef combo and it was also pretty dang good! I haven't had anything bad yet so I'm updating to 5 stars.

Ordered a Calzone Special. It has mushrooms, peppers, pepperoni, sausage and cheese. Hope I didn't leave anything out. It was really good! I live in Peoria so I probably won't be back for that reason, but if I was close by I'd definitely stop in to try the rest of their menu.

Please don't live here. It's march 14th and it's 90 degrees. It will be ninety degrees for at least another week. I'm 7 1/2 months pregnant and I can't stand it. The office staff did not inform me when I signed the lease that I would not be able to control the temperature. The A/C doesn't run until April 1st. It's actually a swamp cooler so half the year it's cold, and half the time it's heat.The office, however has A/C...but all of us suffer. I live on the second floor and it is sooo hot. During the "winter" time (no such thing in Arizona), they turn off the air and put on the heater. I felt it was way premature because I could not sleep at night. Even with a fan. It's just hot! I mean, does 60 degrees really call for a heater?! I agree with another review on here that everything is made of cheap materials. Everything falls apart around here. I can barely change the temperature in the shower bc the temp gauge is so old school and really hard to move. I had them come out and replace it but to no avail. I'm dying to move out. For what we pay it's NOT worth it. There are so many places I've found since moving in that are way bigger and cheaper too. The plus side of the one bedrooms here are that the room is huge. But who cares when you cant sleep at night!!! One last note, the storage in the kitchen sucks. I have no pantry and the only cabinet I have is triangle shaped. It's really annoying to store food in there because of the shape....just don't move in. Google this place and look up reviews. You will find many more way worse than this....

I always come here when I don't feel like cooking and I want something healthy for my 2 year old. The past few times I've come I've gotten the black bean or salmon burger. The cilantro jalapeno hummus is amazing. I love this place!

I had the delicious chicken club avocado meal. I like how the options for sides aren't just chips, but potato salad, macaroni salad and grapes too! My sandwich was wonderful. I would give them 5 stars but I've only had one thing off the menu so far so who knows. I got a side of their house dressing to dip my sandwich in. Really good.

I came back to this place because the food was awesome, but I was really off put by the rude a** older lady with the glasses who worked the register this time. I came up, ordered, she asked me if it's for here or to go. I said for here. Then she said ma'am I don't have time for this we have a line. Is this for here or to go? I said I said it's for here. And I'm really confused by what you're talking about. She pointed to a no cell phone sign and said she's just not wanting to step on anybody's toes. I said okay (WTF?!?!).   I answered her question immediately and didn't understand why she needed to be rude. Yes I glanced down at my phone, but after I answered her. So why are you talking to me like a child? F off.

I had the taco combo platter. It includes 3 tacos, rice, beans, and a "salad" (lettuce). I chose carne asada for the meat. Everything was delicious. I loved the horchata as well. I would definitely come here again to taste something else. You know a Mexican restaurant is good when their beans are good! The beans were awesome.

I saw Shannan for my first time at this place. I dont typically get waxed for facial hair, but I decided to give it a try instead of threading. She was sweet, and did a great job. This location is far from home for me, but if I'm in the area again I'll see Shannan because she made me feel really comfortable.

I haven't been to WingStop that many times before so I didn't expect customer service from a small wing joint. I was pleasantly surprised :) I like that even a fast food chain can have friendly people. My boyfriend walked up to the counter and asked for a box and the guy told him he'd wrap up our stuff for us. So my boyfriend then brought the tray up to the counter and he took our food and brought it back neatly boxed and bagged. I also went up to the counter and was greeted by a nice guy who asked if I needed a refill and filled my cup. It's the little things that make an establishment worthwhile to visit. You just don't have that at McDonald's. Service was a little slow. I personally don't think their wings are anything to rave about, but ill come back soon for sure because I was treated nicely.  Thanks WingStop!

The ribs fell off the bone they were so tender and juicy. I almost ordered wings but the manager said that everyone comes for the ribs. Glad I got them. Service is super friendly,  the manager put cartoons  on the TV for my toddler and was really attentive. If I'm on this side of town again I'll definitely come back.

First time here and I ordered the Ackee Strudel, and the Conch Fritters for an appetizer, and the jerk fish tacos for the main entree. I've never had Jamaican food before so I was surprised at the flavors used, but that's a good thing!  I'll be back to try out more of the menu for sure.   I also grabbed a Pineapple and Pineapple Ginger soda. Both were really good ! Not much carbonation, but lots of flavor and sugar lol.

Awesome place. I want to try everything on the menu. I got the crab avocado sandwich and the honey chipotle salad. Salad was meh, but the sandwich was BOMB! All meals come with a chocolate dipped strawberry and bread.   Cool atmosphere. I like how they let you sample soups as you're waiting. I tried the chicken enchilada chili soup which was DELISH! I might get that next time instead of a salad. The desserts looked TO DIE FOR, but I was too full to order anything. I will definitely come back. I hope they build one closer to my home.

MaGyver and Tayvon were what made this visit 5 stars. I came in at about 7 pm to get a new car charger for my Galaxy s6. MacGyver initially  answered the phone when i called and told me the price and that they were open until 8 pm. So I came right in..I was informed that I can return the product within 14 days  (if I remember correctly), and I have a 1 year warranty on the charger. Both of them were so friendly, personable, and professional, it blew me away. Normally at this time of night, employees are bored and ready to go home, and you can tell in the way they treat you. Not them ! They convinced me to switch back  t mobile, and with service like this, I'd be stupid not to. Once I get my Sprint situation figured out, I'll come in and make sure I get those two commission! Thanks guys!

I love finding healthier options to eat, but I was disappointed at the menu choices. It's mostly salads, and I wasn't in the mood for that and everything else was just kinda boring sounding. I ordered the Annie Oakley panini and it was okay. Seriously nothing special. The wraps didn't sound very appetizing either. Maybe I'll come back when I'm in the mood for a salad?
