After eating here I was actually pissed off that I didn't know about it before. The portions of sashimi are amazingly large. That doesn't mean crap if the quality is not there, but fortunately for Sakana, it's there. They even have house specials (like salmon smoked on the premises). AWESOME! My only complaint is the lack of fresh wasabi (they have pickled or the powdered stuff).   For the area, this should be 5 stars. I just can't compare it to Kiji in SF or Blue Ribbon in NYC, which are my 5 star benchmarks.

My parents and I had a last minute change of plans on Christmas Day so we drove around looking for a place to eat dinner.  Luckily, we came across Zinc and they had an available table for us.  With the very small exception of my oyster appetizer coming extremely late, the service was perfect.  My mom enjoyed her swordfish, while my father and I both ordered the tenderloin topped with fois gras.  My favorite part of the dinner was the wine, which was very reasonably priced.  I selected a 2005 Chateau Gloria which drank beautifully at its youthful age.  The crowd can get a bit loud, but then again, it's a bistro and this was Christmas.  I can't wait to go back, drink more wine and enjoy more wonderful food.

Perfect haircuts and great service.  Have not done a massage yet, but really want to soon.  $45 for men's cut is not that pricey to me either.  They have a rewards program that lets you earn free services.  Also, on Wednesdays, you get a $5 starbucks card with your haircut.

I felt like agent Cooper in Twin Peaks as I sat down to sample several slices of pie in one sitting.  I'm twitching as I write this... drooling over the memory of each slice and how amazingly good it tasted.  The blueberry crumb, the peach, the Jack Daniel's pecan.  I left with a whole apple crumb, which later on became 1/3 of an apple crumb pie before nights end.  As their website states, worth the drive from anywhere.... it is.

I love this place.  It's far from my home, but close to my brother's so whenever I visit him, I need to get some pizza and wings.  Large cheese pizza and 20 wings runs you $19.99.  Can't beat that for what you get.  The wings are exactly how I like them... crispy and Frank's hot sauce on them.  Pizza can get a bit card-boardy but I love the sauce and cheese.  It reminds me of the Pizza Den in NJ.

Went back for the sixth time and it's still one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  Of course, I left the gift card my brother gave me for xmas at home, but oh well, another excuse to go back again.  This was my first hot stone massage at the Fairmont and it was one of the best.  The services are all great, but what I love is the complete experience.  Booking one service gets you access to the entire gym and spa for the day.  Take advantage of it and get there hours before your service.  I like to work out for 1-2hrs, then soak in the waterfall hot tub.  Head up to the roof to the pool and chill in a cabana that can be closed (encompassing two lounge chairs) for some privacy, or just swim and relax.  I was told they are building a nice bar (complete with alcohol) this summer, which will be a nice treat.    The men's facility is amazing.  There's a eucalyptus inhalation room, jacuzzi, and Swiss shower, plus plenty of regular showers, shaving areas, and great apples and beverages.  After cleaning up, I get my services, then shower again and hang out by the pool for a bit longer.    My only dissatisfaction is the food.  Don't bother getting it from the spa, it's terrible.  I've tried it twice and it failed to please both times.  That being said, be sure to ask for the specials when you book because there are always deals going on.  Also, sign up for the President's club when you arrive (it's free and you get 10% off future services).

Outstanding in almost every way.  The menu changes daily, although about half the dishes remain for more than a week.  Two quick and easy points: 1. The attached wine store is great.  Respectable selection, a bit higher than total wine or bev mo, but the corkage is less if you buy next door so go ahead and save the time. 2. Prixe Fixe options are 3 or 4 course.  Get the 4, the portions are small for America, but right in line with what a good dining experience should be, and that's variety.  Who wants to stuff themselves with 20oz of the same cut of steak?  Fat Southerners do...   I began my meal with breaded sweetbreads.  They were fantastic... perfectly cooked and just the right amount to satisfy an early bite.  The next course was roasted golden beets with spinach and duck confit.  Awesome.  Great flavors.  My main course was a local ribeye which came out closer to medium than my ordered med-rare.  The cut was about 5oz in my opinion, but again, perfect to me.  The seasoning throughout the dinner was spot on... I mean perfect.  The final course was called "death by elvis" and was a chocolate, peanut butter, banana cheesecake topped with candied bacon.  NOTHING can describe the bliss here...  Lastly, in my opinion, very few restaurants cook well enough to bring a prized bottle of wine to for a special occasion.  Although I adore great wine, I hate it when the wine becomes the star of the evening, and not the food.  This is one place that makes the cut for those of you who have a great bottle and want impeccable food to pair it with.  Enjoy!

Jim Breuer.... JIM BREUER!  Holy crap, I'm glad our table was near the exit to the bathroom because I nearly pissed my pants twice from laughter.  Anyway, onto the place itself. This is one of the best comedy clubs I have ever been in.  Tables were crowded as you could expect, but still a great view from anywhere on the floor.  There's no pillars in the way or other obstructions.  We were near the back of the first floor, which was still close enough to easily see Jim's facial expressions.  There is a two item minimum per person, which can be food or drinks.  No one ate any food (we saw the 10pm show) but the drinks came out quickly and beers were ice cold.  This place is also easy to get to and there is a sushi restaurant with $5 sake bombs for happy hour... and I'm not just talking about half a beer and a shot of sake.  These $5 drinks consist of a LARGE Japanese beer and a half pitcher of sake.  You can probably make 3-4 bombs out of this.  I can't remember the name of the place, but it's right downstairs from the club in the same strip mall.

You people are f-ing nuts.  This place could not be more Americanized and could not taste more like cafeteria food.  It looks like most reviewers gave stars for how cheap the food is.  "half off drinks!" wow, that helps me figure out if this place serves good food or not.  Is Greek beer supposed to be warm and flat as well?  Service was terrible.  Food came out very fast, but it was cold which led me to believe it was sitting there, prepared ahead of time.  Ugh.

There's nothing better for me in Las Vegas than making enough money to pay for my food and wine habit.  I hit on the Kentucky derby and playing poker made me a grip as well so my buddy and I headed over to grab some bait.    We sat at the sushi bar and I ordered a nice Junmai Daigingo bottle of sake that was reasonably priced around $100 for a 700ml.  I scribbled a bunch of marks on the sushi menu and handed it to the chef.  "You order too much!" he replied.  I gave him my biggest smile and rebuttled, "We're professionals..." to him.  He smiled and began to cut the toro sashimi, uni sashimi, maguro, sake, hamachi, ikura, shiro maguro, and a couple of rolls that my buddy ordered.  The fish was remarkable.  I was a bit bummed that they did not have any monkfish liver on (or off) the menu.  Love that stuff and it's just rare to find it.  We ordered twice more before calling it a night.  I rolled myself out of there, happily drunk off sake and feeling the buzz of good happy fish in my stomach.  I'd go back in a heartbeat.

Great pizza but not something I would need to wait hours for.  We had a fun day drinking wine while we waited but I think most of this hype was Oprah driven.  I might say that it is slightly better than Grimaldi's, but it is nothing like pizza in Rome or Naples.  I think like a lot of things, it's the local ingredients that work so well in certain places (like bagels in NY, etc...)  I still think it's a fun experience and I'm happy this exists in Arizona.

A friend of mine, who has lived here over 20yrs with his family, constantly badgered me to get to this place.  Finally, I had a weekend without travel or other plans and I gave in to the drive to Mesa for what was supposed to be awesome food.    THIS FOOD GOES TO 11....  As I have grown older, I seem to be sweating more when I eat hot foods.  The salsa alone made me ask the waiter for a kitchen towel.  Both the red and green salsas packed a great bunch of heat, but not the crappy "burn the crap out of your mouth" type of heat.  It was a slow, mellow burn, with FLAVOR!  I knew I was in for a great meal.  I had to order a red chili tamale, and a carne adovada burro.  The chunks of roasted pork reminded me of the best osobucco I had ever cooked.  I cleared the plate and ever since I left the restaurant, I have this yearning to return.  I'm obsessed now... dreaming of when I can go back and eat more.

There is still better "purist" sushi out there, but for creativity, Nobu is still at the top of the list.  I enjoyed an arrangement of raw shellfish centered around a solid brick of Himilayan rock salt.  The instructions were to place the fish on the salt for a couple of seconds, then remove and eat.  I have seen this on Iron Chef, and the result was quite tasty.  Uni was nice, o-toro was very high quality but the winner of the evening was the yellowtail collar, which I am not sure was on the menu.  The collar is just fantastically flavorful.  I did not see the bill (it was a business dinner) but I assume it was a bit over the top.  Nonetheless, I love being able to stumble out of Nobu and head to the Hard Rock bar to drink more.

Solid food, and a really fun waiter made my experience at Bartolotta a great one. This food did not blow me away, but it made me very happy. We began by sharing a bunch of apps. The duck liver pate with white truffles was tasty, as was the beef tar tare (not particularly memorable, but not bad). The menu is all about the fresh fish, which is presented to you ala Morton's steak cart... it's rolled over on a bed of ice. They charge by the gram. Come on... we're in America here, at least put friggin ounces on the menu. I have no idea what 300grams of fish looks like, and I'm not an idiot, I just never measure my cuts of protein in grams. Anyway, as I typically do in places where everything looks amazing, I let the chef select what to cook for me, which ended up being snapper in a wine broth with tomatoes and artichokes. It was light, simple, delicate, and just what I wanted. I would not bust my butt to come back or to bring a friend here, there's just too many outstanding places in Vegas that charge $50-60 a plate to go to before here.

Just spent my first time at a poker table here in Vegas.  $1 small blinds and $3 big blinds.  Seemed harmless enough.  With my buddy Bates who aced MIT in 3yrs but has social issues (most genious types do).  He and I bought in for $200 each and had two hours before our reservations at the Voodoo Steakhouse in the Rio (where we're staying).  Somehow or another, and don't call it beginner luck because I know the rules of poker, I end up $500 on the positive side of things.  At this point I walk away.  $500 is enough on the first night.  Bates on the other hand is up about $1000.  I go to the room to watch some hockey and wait another half hour before our dinner reservations.   I come back to the table to find  Bates stacked with the "great wall of $5 chips"... I'm talking about $2500 worth of $5 chips.  I beg him to leave but he's bombed and continues to blurt out loud, "these people suck at poker and I'm gonna take all of their money".  Which he probably would have, but he got so drunk he did not know what he was doing.  I watched him place $100 bets without ever looking at his hand.  Anyway, I could not get him away so I left and spent my first dinner in Vegas alone.  I could care less.   Which gets me to the point: I sat down and ordered Kobe carpaccio as a starter, plus a martini with blue cheese olives.  It was served with roasted golden beets and a very fine goat cheese rolled in lavender pollen.  Friggin awesome.  For the main course, I had a kobe ribeye (austrailian) that was brilliantly served with a veal shank bone roasted so the marrow ended up crispy on top.  This was truly a religious experience, topping the kobe ribeye with marrow.  Wine, you ask?  I kept it on the downlow... a 1991 DRC Richeborg did just well.  Just kidding... they had that on the menu for $15,000.  Hahahaha...   I went with a 2001 Gaja Brunello for $250.  All in all, I spent $450 of my winnings on an amazing dinner.    BTW - security just dropped off Bates.  They found him passed out on the 5th floor.  He's sound asleep.  I went back to the poker room and the guys at the table said he gave every $ back over time.  Sucks to be him.  I tried at least 5 times to get him to leave.  Oh well.   Good times in Vegas!

My first introduction to Michael Mina was at Aqua in San Francisco right around the turn of the century. It was eye opening (and stomach satiating) to be introduced to such simple yet amazing food. The deconstructed tuna tar tare mixed in front of you... the lobster pot pie carefully removed from the inverted crust topping and placed on your plate in the shape of a lobster... it was all new and amazing to me.   Now, Mina (with the help of Andre Agassi's bankroll) is spreading his awesomeness around the country with establishments such as Bourbon Steak, Nobhill Tavern, Stripsteak and his signature Michael Mina found in the old Aqua location in the Bellagio hotel.   Remnants of Aqua are still there... the lobster pot pie and the tar tare, but I went all fois while there. The seared scallops topped with fois gras were simply decadent. The texture and cooking temperature just blew my palate. They were paired with a little bit of citrus, vanilla, and a parsnip puree. I followed that with more fois... this time on top of a fillet (not my usual cut, but the fois was sure to add a layer of fatty type richness). The beef was served on top of a potato pancake, then topped with a nice slice of fois gras and had a perigourdine sauce drizzled over top.   My meal ended with an outstanding trio of cheeses with some atypical accompaniments like tiny marinated mushrooms and jellied pomegranate. All in all, Mina continues to please with impeccable service and remarkable food.

I try and I try and I try to like this place but the only thing Fleming's does consistently is let me down!  Simply said... our shrimp appetizers came out sans deveining.  Yes, the digestive track of the shrimp were right there for us to see.  Next, my veal chop came out raw.  RAW!  Cold and uncooked in the center.  I sent it back twice, and finally just gave up.  Amateur hour again.  To their defense, I had an amazing steak at the Dayton, Ohio location.  But at least four other locations have let me down.  Sigh...

Wow!  WOW!  I would have never expected to find this kind of quality here in AZ.  My mother is Italian and I am from Jersey and I won't ever say that these meatballs taste like hers, but damn, they are pretty good.  The bread is awesome as well.  Totally reminds me of being back home.  My friends ordered salads and they cleaned their plates.  I love the owner as well.  He personally thanks everyone for coming in and he shook my hand.  I can't wait to go back and try the eggplant parm.

My friend and I decided to go cougar hunting last Tuesday and I knew this place would not let us down.  I have not eaten here yet, but I will try it soon, when the time is right.  I've eaten at Mastro's steakhouse, which is excellent so I assume this place does not let down.  After two $18 martinis (yes... $18 friggin dollars, but you get the shaker which is good for two pours (the second being a bit more watered down)) the bar started to get friendlier.  We were surrounded by what looked like several baseball players' ex-wives.... 50-somethings with tons of right hand bling, and leathery skin, but done up well and with the correct level of inebriation, pretty doable :) The ambiance is best in class, and the wait staff was attentive and friendly.  I'll never be a fan of the 1000 degree plate (cook the food in the kitchen, not in front of me or I'd be at Benihana) but the seafood looked stunning.  Great place for a business dinner as well. I was bothered when the valet moved my Dodge rental car out of the way for a Ferrari F360 but you can't win them all.

Fantastic meal last weekend... only exceeded by the service.  Our server, Lloyd, was put to the test with a table full of highly inebriated and hungry folks, and he passed with flying colors (or maybe it was the fireworks going on outside the restaurant).  Our food was stunning, even though I was served the smallest kumumoto oysters I've ever seen.  Three of us had fish and the other three had steaks.  Everyone was highly pleased with their meal, but again, Lloyd stole the show with amazing service, a great sense of humor, and attention to detail.  The six of us managed to get out of there for $600 before the tip, which I think is not too shabby given the $40-$50+ per entree cost.  The Dungeness crab appetizer was one of my highlights and my blackened Florida grouper was absolutely perfectly cooked to medium.  I highly recommend this place for a special meal or for any celebration.

Very good margaritas (although tough to discern quality after your first one is down the hatch) and pretty nice guacamole... sorry, but I make it better. The first time I went to this place, I felt it was an amazing experience, and by far the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had, followed by one of the best carne asada plates I have ever had as well. So I recommend it for a business outing, which gets everyone excited. Drinks are fine, orders are taken and the guacamole begins to get prepared table side. As soon as we begin to dive into the guac, the soup arrives. One of our guests was in the restroom, and his soup was served while he was away. BAD, BAD waiter. Hot, cold, warm dish... whatever, you do not serve an empty seat.   While enjoying our soup, entrees come out and were placed right next to our arms on sizzling hot plates. No one was even half way through their soup. I was furious and felt obligated to quickly shovel my soup so I could bring the dinner plate to my front and eat.   Our waiter came over to clear the soup bowls and asked how dinner was and if he could bring anything. "How about desert right now" I remarked, and unfortunately, he did not get the sarcasm.   Food = 4 stars  Service = 0 stars

I've been living here over a year now and really love the neighborhood.  Although it's secluded from any nightlife (I prefer that at my age) it still has a nice vibe by the pool in the summer.  The townhouse that I have is very quiet, spacious, and keeps in heat in the winter and air in the summer.  The staff is friendly and responds quickly if you need them.  Only once have I heard some tool come home with his/her stereo blasting from the car, but for the most part, the tenants are typically working adults or married young couples.  There is plenty nearby, like two AJ's, CVS, Basha's, Valero (yay! American gas!) and quick access to the 101.  Although not cheap, I prefer the atmosphere and peace you can find here.

I love living near this place.  I'm a big fan of tapas and have tasted nearly everything on the menu, as well as brunch (which is AMAZING).  A couple of items not to miss are the octopus, the fried anchovies, and the brussles sprouts.  David is also great with his wine selection.  Be sure to ask him for help if you don't know your Spanish varietals.  Don't miss this place if you are in the mood for great food and wonderful decor.  The place is hoppin as well later at night.

Had a wonderful lunch. Fish was very fresh, the service was friendly and attentive, and the prices were on par with what you would expect.   There was a miserable wretched lady next to us wearing sunglasses inside throughout her entire lunch and she complained about EVERYTHING! She was yelling at the sushi chef and demeaning him because he didn't understand the fish names in Japanese (I believe he was Hispanic, what do you want?!?!). We were in shock watching this.   She finally went to the manager and complained several times. The manager had to take the poor chef to the back and reprimand him and give the wench a free lunch. My friends and I felt that this wasn't the first time this lady got a free lunch. The reason I brought this up is to stress how well the place handled a horrible customer. It's tough to keep your cool, but the chef did his job well and the manager got her out of the place quickly.   I'd go back any time.

Quite possibly one of the best restaurants in the US.  This was easily one of the best dining experiences of my life.  We sat down and received an overview of the extensive wine list (handily kept on an ipad) and were presented with the four story wine cellar managed by "wine angels" who fly up and down to retrieve your selected bottle(s).  It's stunning.  First, don't listen to folks who "dropped in" and sat at the bar.  This place deserves the respect of making a reservation and sitting down for the experience.  Get the tasting menu.  It was $85 per person, and had four double courses, each playing off their own theme.  For instance, course one was "foie gras" and had a hot and cold prep.  Very non-traditional preps as well, not just seared and terrine.    Let me back up though... our REAL first course was the foie gras chicken and waffles.  Are you kidding me?  I prefer not to swear in reviews, but WOW, this was f-ing amazing.  Perfectly seared foie over crispy chicken skin, a waffle, and dark meat bits of succulent chicken.  I could have just ordered three more portions of this with a bottle of sauternes and been happy as hell.  Anyway, after the chicken and waffles came the first foie course, which was amazing.  The second course was a play on squash, the third was a play on "cheek".  On one side, we hade grade A5 kobe beef cheeks with some tenderloin and on the other side we had cod cheeks.  Remarkable.  The final course was a play on peaches.  A perfect ending.    Wine pairing was $55 in addition to the $85 tasting fee.  You will not leave hungry, and the wines were truly paired very well.  I've been to Vegas over 50 times and always wanted to eat here.  Now it will be on my list each time I go.

Oysters were amazing.  Nice selection and they had both Kumamoto and Beau Solieil on the menu.  That being said, unless you can't shuck them properly or get old oysters, it's not right to judge a place on the oysters alone.  My fish came extremely undercooked.  This would be fine if I ordered Ahi, but for a fatty cut of Vietnamese Cobia, undercooking is a sin and left the fish rubbery and cold.  Unfortunately, after eating a couple of bites my appetite was gone and I didn't bother to send it back.  I'll pass on a return visit.

Sorry, after 4 days of horrid food poisoning I need to drop them to 1 star... or actually no stars.  I'm confident it was the improperly prepared Cobia that left me hunkered down in the bathroom for nearly a week.  I suggest they stick to fish that is easy to prepare and turns quickly... salmon, tuna, etc...

I wish I could slam down 5 stars, and some day I may, but for now, I have to ding them for overcooking my $45 steak.  In the tradition that Ruth's Chris started, Mastro's brings out your steak on a 1000 degre plate (or something like that).  All that does, other than provide sizzle when the steak is delivered, is continue to cook your steak until a mid-rare ends up mid-well.  Too bad because the flavor was great.  We began our night at the bar, which was extremely slow, given the fact that it was not even busy.  We sat down and our server was very good at trying to upsell everything.  We had the seafood tower since there were five of us, and it was pretty good.  Their lobster mashed potatoes are a must have.  The wine list is priced very high.  Most bottles are a minimum of 3x retail.  I miss California and corkage.  I have excellent bottles in my collection and would gladly pay $20-30 to bring them to a restaurant.  The 2003 Margaux ran $3,600 a bottle, and it released around $899.  That's crazy to me.  Overall, I think I would go back and give them another shot, but I can't say this is the best steakhouse I've been to.

Simply one of the best dinners I have ever had.  First, don't skip the bar... not for the decor, but for the home made cheese straws that are baked each day.  They are friggin great.  The meal began with some shared appetizers; baby arugula salad, home made salumi plate with proscuitto made by Mario's father, and calamari.  All were delicious.  My boss and I split the bone-in ribeye for two which was carved tableside.  This steak was dry aged 6 weeks and cooked to perfection (slightly under medium rare, but not rare).  My only complaint was the lack of values on the wine list.  Seriously Mario, you place hundreds of Italian wines on the menu, and only a handful are under $100 a bottle?  These obscure libations are more respectable when guests can afford more than one bottle.  I ordered a L'Adventure from Paso Robles for $80 which drank well.

As stated in previous reviews, I've been a Michael Mina fan since the beginning in SF.  Bourbon Steak is one of his newer establishments, bankrolled by Agassi, and specializes in more American style dishes than his signature "trio" style of preparation.    We had fois gras sliders, Mina's signature tuna tare tar, and plenty of steak (poached in butter, then grilled to perfection).  Sides were truffled mac and cheese, asparagus and white cheddar potatoes.  All very good, but not outstanding.    What was outstanding was the 18yr old Macallan butterscotch sauce for the beignets.  No joke... serve that stuff on a woman.  Forget the beignets... just give me that butterscotch and some privacy with a lady.  That alone is 6 stars.  All you haters out there are just upset you didn't think of that first.  And yes... my "to go" bag had plenty of butterscotch.

Solid.  Tons of flavorful meat and very good tatziki sauce adorn a nice fresh, warm pita.  A gyro with fries and fountain drink runs $7.25 and it's worth every penny.

In three days, I ate Japanese A5 Kobe at three different restaurants, each prepared a different way.  While no particular one was better than the other, I was amazed at Yellowtail's preparation and dipping sauce.  When the plate hit the table, we looked like gremlins after midnight, devouring each piece like it was the last piece in existence.    Rewind to us waiting for our table and them trying to place us facing the smoky and noisy casino. No... $100 later and we're on the outdoor balcony facing the famous bellagio fountains.  That's more like it.    We ordered uni and we were presented with a small portion of nigiri.  After describing that we literally wanted a "pile of uni" on a plate, the waiter quickly returned with exactly that.  We scarved that down with smiles until more sushi came out.  I would say the fish was wonderful, fresh, and paced well.    It's not cheap, but it's great if you are in the mood to splurge or if you won some $ at the tables and have extra cash to throw around.  Enjoy!

I really can't get enough of this place.  For anyone who understands true Italian food, this is a must try.  I always enjoy their fish.  Perfectly prepared and always served up with delicious vegetables.  In my opinion, this place is a bargain given the entrees are all in the $20-30 range.  Pasta is even less than that.  They also have a decent Italian wine offering with most glasses in the $8-10 range and bottles below $40.  I've always found the food fresh, the service pleasant and the atmosphere lively.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, LARGER portions?  Go to Golden Corral if you want to stuff your face.

Outstanding sushi.  Off the hook bathrooms... I had a great buzz from the cold sake and beer I drank, but oh my, the crooked doorways and slanted walls get you spinning!    The uni was some of the best I have ever had, the toro was top notch, and my only complaint was the lack of fresh wasabi.  Come on sushi places... quit it with the play-dough powder mix and get the fresh stuff... charge $2 if you need to, we'll pay for it.

I booked a 90 minute hot lava rock massage and really had a wonderful experience.  From the moment you enter the spa, you feel relaxed.  Juliana did a great job on my back, which was just tense from 6 weeks of travel, and the soft Hawaiian music in the background, and sounds of the sea had me waking myself up from drifting into a slight snore.  I liked the availability of a shower and nice products to use after you were done.  The rates are affordable and the service is professional.

Sorry, but I brought in two very nice pairs of shoes for a little stretching and conditioning and a week later when I went to pick them up, nothing had been done.  The owner swore that he stretched them, but they feel no different.  My shoe trees were missing as well, and he conveniently found them in another customer's box... neither pair were conditioned, in fact they looked dirtier than before.  I plan to bring them back to see if they can be "stretched" again and will gladly follow up with another review.

Took another week to stretch them more.  After pointing to the exact pain spot twice, the shoes are now stretched in the wrong area.  I'm talking about LV and Prada loafers ruined.  As nice as the owner seems to be, he did not get the job done correctly.

Great service, good bagels... East Coast style and sometimes warm.  Although today for the fist time, I was thoroughly pissed off.  I ordered an egg bagel toasted with lox, tomato and cream cheese.  I got to work, ready to dig in, and found an untoasted bagel, with just lox on it...  no cream cheese, no tomato.  Argh!!!

Stopped in to get a new iPad and was promptly greeted (even though the store was swamped).  Apple has nailed customer service.  Their employees are well educated, friendly, and not pushy when it comes to warranties and accessories.  In less than 10 minutes, I had my iPad in hand, and my "genius" offered me a tutorial if I wanted one.  Even cooler was the gadget he used to run my card.  When I was ready for my purchase, we walked to an available computer, entered some info and he scanned the box with his handheld gadget, which also ran my credit card.  He asked me if I wanted to get a print out of the receipt or just get it via e-mail (which is what I chose to do).  Awesome.  BTW - iPad is fun as hell and great if you travel.  There's also a free Yelp app.  Woohoo!

Finally a burger joint that makes good on their promise of a Kobe burger. I loved the ordering process where you add what you want each step of the way. My burger came out perfectly done and with the exact toppings I asked for (unlike Lush) The sweet potato fries were crispy and hot. Service was friendly and not pretentious at all. To make things even better, they have an amazing selection of micro brews on tap. Goose Island's Matilda? Wow! Definitely going back here.

Paid $18.52 for a Kobe burger, sweet potato fries and iced tea.  Burger came out well done versus my medium temperature order.  I ate it anyway and it was mediocre.  Right next door, you can get a larger Kobe burger with much better flavor at AJ's for $9.  Save time and money and go there.

Gave them another shot and went in with an open mind.  Unfortunately, the only improvement has been with the service, which is very friendly.  We arrived before the lunch rush and I ordered their lunch special which was a burger, fries and soda.  I ordered a medium burger with cheddar cheese and no onions.  Twenty minutes later, I got a well done burger with onions and swiss cheese.  My fries were soggy but the iced tea I ordered was nice a cold!  Sorry, just can't deal with something that is so simple to do.  I mean, millions of us can do burgers and fries in the backyard perfectly...

Wow, servers were a bunch of stuck up b's in corset's... that's original. Didn't eat, but wanted to check out the crowd on a Friday night.  Bleh... typical NoSco crowd of gym jockeys in Affliction shirts two sizes too small... late 40's women with enough botox to look early 40's and a few lost 20 somethings stretching to pay $12 for a drink.  The cover band made it an easy decision to bail and salvage the night at Eddy V's with some great oysters and live jazz from actual musicians.

Had a fantastic massage with Liz.  She knew all the muscle structure and pressure points.  Though not the fanciest of places, it's perfect if you just need to get a massage.  If you want to be pampered and get the spa feel, this may not be your place.  For me, my back hurt from sleeping crooked and I left feeling much better.

Absolute rubbish and RUDE service by the day time waitress.  Greasy fries that were "hand cut" and very slow service resulted in a nearly 2hr lunch that left none of us satisfied.  Don't waste your time, the Tilted Kilt is in the same parking lot and offers far better food (I can't believe I said that) and far friendlier service.

Amazing quality and very good service.  I was just upset at the typical Las Vegas pricing (up to $10 EACH piece of nigiri and that's not Toro...) but it's Vegas, so suck it up.  The house junmai ginjo sake is great for $60 a bottle.  Very floral and dry and perfect with sashimi.  The fresh Aji (they bring out the whole fish on the plate and then deep fry the carcass when you are done with the raw flesh) is a must get.  I was also a bit upset at the amount of items that were not available on the menu.  They were out of 4 or 5 things we wanted.  Other than that, the gorgeous Cosmopolitan hotel houses some amazing restaurants from NY and this one does not disappoint.  Just bring some serious cash if you are hungry.

*Reviewing cocktails only*  I have not eaten here yet but if the cocktail quality is met or surpassed by the food, this is a huge winner.  The bartenders know their stuff and they use amazing ingredients like the antique formula vermouth (this stuff is $30 a bottle!) and luxardo cherries ($20 a jar).  My test is always to order a mescal drink and let the bartender make up what he/she wants with it.  I've had several of them and they've all been on par with some of the best cocktail places in SF, NY and Chicago.  My only small ding is the prices are high for Scottsdale.  SF has an average of $10 a cocktail at a respectable place... maybe $12.  I've paid $13.50+ at CPH.  Not a huge deal, but you get what you pay for here.

Fantastic experience.  Our journey began with white fish carpaccio, which was topped with marinated green onions, yuzu, and a tasty broth.  It was delicate and very flavorful.  The next course was three different preparations... one poached shrimp with the head fried, a kumumoto oyster (only one unfortunately), and tuna taretar.  All three were very tasty.  Our third course was A5 kobe beef served raw in front of a hot plate where you grilled it yourself to your liking.  A side of house made steak sauce and some himilayan salt was presented to enhance the flavor.  I preferred only the salt after grilling.  The fourth course was six pieces of nigiri including three rare fishes from Japan that I had never had raw, and a very nice piece of oh-toro to finish off the meal.  Finally, they brought a custard desert with fresh fruit which was a great way to finish the meal.  We each had a half bottle of booze (sake for me and reisling for the lady).  The bill with tip was slightly under $300 so be prepared to spend.  That being said, if you found A5 kobe at any restaurant it would run $25-30 an ounce and the portions here were about 4-5oz so I felt it was well worth the price.

Sorry, we've managed to break every button on your shirt again. I explained before dropping off that the buttons are special (Thomas Pink $250 shirt) and they still busted them all off. When will someone open a "no button breaking" dry cleaner???

Awesome burger.  I had one in Ohio about two years ago and loved it.  For only being open two days, this place was humming and the staff had their business down.  My order came out perfect and quick.  The AZ burger was awesome.  Not too spicy, but very good balanced flavor with each bite.  The smash sweet potato fries were just delicious.  Tossed in salt, olive oil and rosemary, still crunchy, and nice and sweet.  I'm glad we have one close to work now!

Horrible experience.  After drinking for two hours at HiFi, we ordered the same exact round of drinks across the street at Bottled Blonde.  The round more than DOUBLED in cost.  Our $14 shots were $35.  The bartender called us liars when we brought it up.  He said "I work over at HiFi sometimes and we charge more than that" then he walked away from us.  We hunted down the manager, who was far more polite and he explained they had a formula for their pricing based on the bottle price (which was $70 at total wine).  So our two shots cost the same as a bottle.  The manager brought us a different shot to make up for the bartender's bad service.  Unfortunately, I will not go back.
