I can honestly say that every TV, DVD player and audio equipment comes from BEST DEAL in TOWN.  They truly are the BEST Deal but even better they are such a great group of guys. So friendly and helpful in everyway.

I was a regular at the original NY54 and was super excited to hear about the restaurant.  I brought the family on opening day...the atmosphere was great...the people were so friendly and attentive...and the food was fabulous.

While the work out is decent and the intent good and the people nice...the administrative side is a nightmare.  I signed up under High pressure and attended two classes. After the second class I decided that it was not for me due to the enormous class size and the difficulty getting times I needed.  They seemed more interested in membership numbers than actually service quality of the people already signed. up. I told the girl up front after that I need to cancel as it was not for me.  She was so frazzled and told me that she would take care of it.  NOW months later afteer no contact they put my account in collections.  When I call NO ONE WILL HELP ME.  Ridiculous!!!  So for the service reason I can not Recommend this studio.  BEWARE

I have tried many dry cleaners over the years and nothing compares to these guys.  They are polite, efficient and have the best customer service. Door to door service has been great for me. And the cleaning...is perfect!  Thanks Lapels!
