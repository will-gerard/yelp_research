just an FYI -- this dump is now closed. yelp should update this or delete the account in general. the new owners drove this place straight into the ground.  Once this place became Blitz Sports Bar & Grill it was a lost cause. The new owner cared more about turning it into his version of Twin Peaks than the actual patrons or sports. The food quality was beyond disgusting. The bathrooms were so gross I had to leave and walk across the street so I could feel safe. There were flies EVERYWHERE in the restaurant... super safe for food. NOT.  This place was amazing when it was Upper Deck! People loved it and they had a huge MSU & U of A following. Now it has chains on the doors and is pitch black inside. So sad.

Wow! This place is quite a steal for the $$!  Pros: Affordable, efficient service, decent variety, they serve alcohol, there are televisions... usually displaying sports of some sort, VERY clean, well lit, friendly staff, speedy service, great 1st date spot  Cons: Not a great place for groups as their largest table is a 4 top, they take reservations but can't actually guarantee a table due to their walk in volume, language barrier between patrons and staff  The food quality is decent. I'm a huge fan of sushi and this is not the absolute best quality but it is definitely not the worst either. I frequent Teharu 2 - 3 times a week because it is so affordable! :) I love to come here to grab a quick bite. You can seriously eat 2 rolls in 15 minutes max. If you want something that isn't on the belt, or listed on the menu they are happy to create what you want. Parking can be a nightmare as this is a really busy area, located conveniently next to the 101.   If you're looking for some affordable sushi and quick, speedy service... Teharu is your spot! Enjoy!!
