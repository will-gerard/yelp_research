Enjoyed dinner here last night.  Service was great, food spectacular, no room to improve my experience.  I ravaged the delmonico and my wife loved the cilantro chicken.  Martinis were also very good.  Shared my comments with manager Corey.

My wife and visited Four peaks for dinner this past Saturday on a date night and it was out of this world.   The food was amazing the server was attentive without being annoying and the beer was perfect.  I tried the flight and really liked the hop knot and the 8th ST.  (Kiltlifter is already in my beer hall of fame club). My only complaint, open a resteraunt on the west side and save me from Rock Bottom and Gordon Biersch.

My wife and I visited this store while celebrating Valentines Day and received a one hour tarot card and numerology reading.  It was extremely entertaining and it gave my wife and I plenty to talk about the rest of the night and even in the weeks after.  I have already recommended this location to my friends looking for a fun way to spend an evening with their spouses.   The staff was very friendly and willing to explain this world to my wife and I since we are, at best, novices.

Food is great.  Portions are modest and flavor is spot on.  Take out and dine both offer great experiences.  I will agree that the dining in experience is a little quiet, no music no TV's.  This part though I have decided I like.  The staff are very, very friendly.  This resteraunt has become my chinese resteraunt of choice over Changs.  Food is equal if not better, Wait Staff is Friendlier, Price point is unbeatable.    This location will only get better as it ages.

Great Service!  Jill always takes care of me!  The food is great, excellent atmosphere and happy hour is a great value.   This place is clean, well managed, and always welcoming... This is a must for west valley dining...

Met some clients here for a meeting and really enjoyed this place. Had a sandwich and the tea both were really good.

Alright,  back again.    Haven't visited since 2013.   This delightful English cafe sticks out amongst the breakfast choices across the entire northwest valley like the positive version of a sore thumb.    Around these parts there are 5 or so breakfast spots offering dissapointingly similar fare amidst a backdrop of barely consistent quasi-good table service. To prove that more culture and better food is desperately needed here, people stand around waiting an hour sometimes for a table at these tired,  dried up, cliche diners only to be served yesterday's specials,  at tomorrow's prices. During there wait the guests can be overheard discussing the good old days of breakfast buffets and church specials mostly unaware that downtown and in the east valley breakfast has been taken hostage by a growing amount of young, hip eateries offering delicious food. Those in the know from the west valley wake up early, strap their kids into their car seats with their sunglasses on to drive East. East into the sunrise and away from this grey, oppressive landscape up to 20 miles just to no longer be the victim of the West side breakfast blues  Alas,  Rayners to the rescue!   With their inventive menu, mom and pop service,  and delicious drink offerings this place is like the creative,  artistic sibling to the surrounding resteraunts that everyone in the family knows will move to New York and be really famous someday.    My sandwich had egg,  bacon and almonds.  It was slap your momma good.  My girl ate a bagel with a kaleidoscope of jalape√±o lime jelly sausage goodness while we both shared a black raspberry lavender iced tea.   Seriously considering deleting this post because I don't want the word to get out and have to deal with the lines as the rest of you cardboard eaters finally get hip to the idea that you deserve better.

This place is delicious and clean.    The staff is friendly and the kitchen is a quasi open concept  which makes it easy to see how clean it is,  and the cleanliness of the employees.    The salsa,  on point.  The rice and beans delicious and they are priced at lunch to complete with anyberto's. (Note the staff at bertos are usually unfriendly and from a cleanliness standpoint, they remind me more of a murder scene than a resteraunt.)    Got the lunch special, large portions with a drink under 8 bucks.   I will definitely be back.

Just so disappointing. Came in under the power of a Groupon for take out.    Ordered mini chimis. Soggy. Sitting on a bed of slimy old iceberg lettuce.   Ordered macho nachos, guacamole was brown.  Literally just scraped it out and threw it away.    Ordered dulce chimi, soggy relatively unimaginative and tasteless with caramel sauce one one side of chimis with cream cheese on the other.   The other reviews are really positive here,  but trying to reuse old guacamole and old lettuce along with the presence of a Groupon indicate doom maybe eminent.    Today's performance only helps.  I won't be back soon.

Food, on point.  Dirty pig sandwich was extremely well done.  Avacado and creamy horseradish shows menu designed with thoughtful intent.  In fact,  the food is the single reason I will be back.    Beer menu,  slightly above par for similar venues in west valley.  Increased taps and better selection of true local craft news l brews would change things dramatically.    Ambience,  nice blend of neighborhood bar meets comfy lounge.    Service left much to be desired.  Bartender (female) working twice as hard as wait staff (also female) who were slow and moved without urgency.  Coaching needed here from management.    This place has alot of potential.  I will be back to try more from the menu.    This place has big potential, excited to try again.    Note: you lost a star for the service.

Food was good,  gnats flying around and dead all over booth connection to wall and the fact they went 1 for 3 of the beers I wanted to try earned them a penalty of -3 stars.   Need to be better managed better.
