I have been going to Dr. Longwill's office since I was in middle school...I am now in my 30s!  There is NO ONE ELSE I will go to, except Dr. Longwill and his staff, until he retires.  I've told Dr. Longwill that he better have a plan for me once he retires :).  Sara at the front desk is wonderful, Judy - one of the hygenists - is superb, and the other hygenests - who I know, but don't see as often - are amazing, as well.  Dr's assistant, Chris, is so gentle and sweet.  Dr. makes the experience of going to the dentist one that I actually do NOT dread, and I know he will take perfect care of me each and every time.  He's got great stories and will make you smile!

This place is yumm-o!  Totally vegan with very tasty meat alternatives.  I see that a few people said that it's "greasy" and "fattening."  Well, it depends on what you order, first of all.  Also, vegans never said that they don't have fattening foods sometimes.  This restaurant would be considered a TREAT (kinda like when non-vegans go to Red Robin or a steakhouse as a treat).  The food is priced right, tastes great, and it's a cool way to get your friends to try vegan stuff the non-scary way :).   Try the crab puffs, no harm chicken parm, mushroom with mock chx and veggie bowl, and the oatmeal cream pies...those are all my favs!

Fair, honest, straight-forward, best prices, won't suggest something you don't need...that's all you really need to know, but...  I have been going to AZ Auto Doctor since I started driving in 1995.  This place is the best shop, hands down. I recommend them to my friends all the time. I have tried other places such as dealerships and "quick lube" type places, but I have been ripped off or drive away feeling unsafe.    I go the location in South Scottsdale off of McDowell and Hayden; this location moved from Butherus in North Scottsdale. Eddie owns the Scottsdale location and is top-notch...has worked on my car since I started going there.  Mark is the front desk, first face/voice you see/hear...is a straight-shooter, knows his stuff, funny, and won't up sell...EVER!

I'm disappointed in the poor reviewers' comments, as those people are obviously not understanding what kind of place Noble Beast is, and the purpose of it.  This is not Petsmart, which is exactly why we SHOULD be going to this store.  Helping a locally owned store that sells high quality, natural products is a GOOD thing!  Of course, they won't have the selection you get at a chain store, so you can't expect to come in for "specific" items (per review from yelp reviewer M E.), but you come to this store for the quality, friendly/helpful staff, and local connections they have.  If you call ahead, sometimes they can order things for you and let you know when the items arrive.  I called to see if they would even return an opened bag of expensive dog food, and they said YES!  They donate to local shelters, which is such a great thing.  The staff is SO friendly AND knowledgable...not rude at all, ever (per review from yelp reviewer Calder C) !  I've met at least 3 different people that work there, now - all passionate animal loving people. And, they have samples, which I love, too.  I highly recommend this place to those of you "green," local friendly, natural food goers.

Just went to this theater last night, and it was great!  Started with friendly staff...every one of them! (not common these days)  Went to get a popcorn, and the nice girl suggested...."why don't you press your button at your seat and someone will come serve you!  Take advantage of the service!"  We went to our seat and after we pressed the service button, someone came within a few minutes.  There was a full menu at our fingertips...including alcohol and specialty coffees.  Our seats were comfortable, leather (or pleather), roomy, we could stretch out our legs without touching the chairs in front of us, we had 3 cup holders between the both of us, and the seats leaned back.  Not a bad seat in the theater...we got to pick our seats BEFORE we went into the movie on a touch screen computer/pad.    I'm really impressed with the prices, too, because for just $2 more than a regular, cramped, loud, teenager-infested movie theater, we felt like we were getting First Class treatment, all night!  The snack, food and drink prices are typical for a movie theater; but not more than it would be elsewhere.  Pretzel was about $4.50 and Hummus was about $6.50 for example.    I'm sad to read Ruth Ann's review because it sounds like an isolated incident, and it also sounds like they did a lot to take care of the issues she had...an experience can't be absolutely perfect.  In my case, there was a little bit of stickiness near my cup holder, but that's not something that will bring my experience down an entire star or 3!   Go to this theater!  It's really a great night out! (As long as you like the movie you pick, which we did :)

Brian was an awesome host!  Seriously, the most fun I've had in awhile (and I'm not really a big drinker).  Perfect for a fun evening or afternoon, bar hopping the bars in Downtown Scottsdale.  Super fun!  Do it!

Went to watch the UFC fight at the Arizona Room last night with my family and we all enjoyed the food, the comfortable seating, the nice staff (manager checked on us two times) and the prices were Great for the taste and portion sizing.  Can't complain about yummy quesadillas and nachos for about $6 each.  Burgers were great, too (my aunt and uncle said so).  We ordered the sopapillas for dessert (just ok) and the churros with ice cream (ok also).  Great place to watch sports on a big screen and eat and great food for a great value.

First time here.  Kinda dead for a Saturday night. Came for TVs to watch football. Called before we came to see if there was happy hour...'yes, until seven.'  Got here and NO happy hour :-(.  Great bar area for watching football. They were out of potatoes! At an Irish bar!  Weird.  Ruben sandwich was ok, not enough meat. I had yummy pretzels with cheese sauce and mustard.  Caesar salad was bland, not enough dressing, and like, five, croutons.  I would probably just go somewhere else if I had a choice...nothing special.
