Phenomenal... that is all that needs to be said about Temaris and the deliciousness that they serve up. From their traditional food menu to their ridiculously awesome sushi - we love this place.

I absolutely love this dentist and the entire staff. Dr John Bigler is an incredible family dentist and he also does orthodontics. He has kept my family of 7's teeth looking nice and white and has done full ortho on me and 2 of my kids thus far. I would recommend them to anyone!

Bean and cheese with sauce and large strips has been my staple there now for over 30 years! Nothing more I can say than an absolutely PHENOMENAL Mexican food joint with incredible history and delicious food.

I am shocked at the stars and previous reviews that have been left about this office. I have loved Impressions Dental. The office staff are amazing and knowledgeable and Dr Baker is about as nice and as good of a dentist as there is. I would recommend this dental office to family, friends, or just anyone that is looking for a new dental experience. Most definitely 5 stars in my book!

Two strikes and you are out!!! Audi Chandler's service department has twice now misdiagnosed my vehicle. The first time this happened I was leaking coolant and was told that my current expansion tank / reservoir was the cause of the leak. It was recommended that I replace the expansion tank. I took the recommendations of the Audi certified mechanics and had them do this work. After the work was completed, I drove off of the lot, got home, and noticed that I still had a coolant leak. I took my car back in only to discover that it was a lower hose that was leaking the coolant. I complained to the service manager. Since I had paid for the wrong work to be done, I was offered a deal...pay for the parts and the labor would be free. I did just that. Sure enough, no more coolant leak. Fast forward now 5 months later, low and behold, I am leaking coolant again. Since the work that was performed on my car was under warranty, I took my car to Audi Chandler to have them check to see if the work they had done was the cause of the coolant leak. I was informed by them that in fact it was not any of the work that they had done, but was a new leak in the oil cooler hoses. They quoted me roughly $1000 dollars to have the work done for the hoses and a new oil cooler (they gave me some definition as to why I would need a new oil cooler, all lies by the way) plus labor. I told them thanks but no thanks and they still charged me $100 for this diagnoses. Again, diagnoses was WRONG! I had a mechanic take a look at my car for a second opinion and low and behold the reason for my coolant leak was a $9 hose that I purchased and replaced myself from my local Auto Parts store. The only time I would use this dealership for service would be if my car was still under warranty and the work / service would be covered under that. Do not use this dealerships service department. They are incompetent and just plain wrong in their diagnosis.

Look - it's obvious that going to the doctor usually happens when something is wrong or someone is sick - so to say that my family and I love going to see Dr Herrera and staff would be a misguided statement. However, in the circumstance when a Doctor is needed, Dr Herrera is spot on phenomenal at what he does and how he greets, treats, and makes you feel as one of his patients. If you need a new doctor or are unhappy with the one you go to, come to Complete Care Medicine and you will be taken care of.

Great experience here. Knowledgable therapists and friendly staff all around. I would suggest / refer them to anyone with a need for physical therapy.

So, long story short, I bought a couple of Nest thermostats and tried to install them...the Nest site said, easy installation, sure, easy if your instructions were better. Anyway, I evidently blew a fuse in my furnace so there was no power to the thermostats. I was told to call a Nest Pro installation company and I knew who I was going to call - Wolff Mechanical.   Called them yesterday and their technician showed up today right within the timeframe of the appointment set. He came in, saw the problem, fixed it within just a few minutes and had my A/C and Heating system up and running all while being controlled by my new Nest Thermostats.   To make things even better, since I bought 2, the Wolff Mechanical employee that scheduled my appointment with me over the phone said that the cost would most likely be $89 per thermostat and whatever else was needed to be done to get them working, she did state however that this would be determined by the technician. Technician Brian got done with the job and only charged me for 1 because he said that is all that was needed. Love it when a company is honest.  I will be using Wolff Mechanical in the future for all of my A/C and Heating needs and I would suggest that anyone else do the same.

Mark (the owner) is the man! We had GCS come and clean our carpets in November of 2014. By mid December we were noticing horrible looking stains and spots in the entry to all rooms. I called GCS and told them about this. Without hesitation Mark came and re-treated all of those areas. Come to find out it was from the company that had previously cleaned my carpets, not going to mention who that was (Chem Dry). We will most definitely be using GCS in the future due to this incredible display of customer service and satisfaction, oh, and the fact that our carpets look awesome. Thanks GCS and thanks Mark!
