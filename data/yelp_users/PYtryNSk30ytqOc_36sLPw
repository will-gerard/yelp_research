Talk about an amazing experience...First off the office is well decorated and clean...the staff pleasant and helpful...Rene the hygenist is caring and gentle.  Dr. Keith is really personable and excellent at what he does.  They don't do extra work that doesn't need to be done, they are very honest.  The office takes many kinds of insurance and they are great with kids too!

The very best dealership to buy a car!  I despise purchasing cars!  So when recently I needed to purchase one i wasn't too excited.  I started by test driving cars at different places and narrowed it down to the super awesome VW Tiguan.  Next, I went a bit crazy emailing all of the VW places searching for the Tiguan I wanted and the best price!  Hands down...Camelback was the best as far as knowledge of product.  Polite yet friendly salespeople.  Nice facility and then throw all that out the door price!   They also had the best deal and the best services that came with it!  It really was a pleasant experience.  I dealt with Antoine.  He was amazing.  He offered to bring the contract and the car to my office to get things done because I was busy!  He made things really easy too!   He is even providing me with  a huge bow for it!  The fact that Antoine and Greg are pretty easy on the eyes made this a nice experience as well!;)

The sales people were great when I was laying the cash down to buy...but forget it on the service end...they get one more chance and I will go else where...it's disappointing because anywhere can be nice when you are ready to spend money and I really expected more from the service than rude service agents...and also the work was not even completed...they let the car sit there half the day and I picked it up and nothing was done to it...they were rude about it...I don't know if I am used to BMW service quality or what...but I am disappointed with this low level of service and customer service standards.

I feel sad to write this...but Vincent needs to improve things or his place will be only a past memory.  I'm ok with that based on the dinner I had there recently. The restaurant was packed...but with people who had Groupons...I only wish I had because my dinner would not have been 177.00.  Too much for a weak and sad plate of out of date food. We had the Foi Gras, small portion and so/so:(...Duck chimichangas they were decent. The wild boar was a tiny serving...we were fine with that because it was tough and difficult to chew.  It was accompanied with a hospital style vegetable medly of green beans with carrot shreds and minute white rice.  We also had trout..it was covered in a heavy white sauce (French) and had the same veg medly and white rice...seriously like the hospital food...or a big banquet service.  It was edible...but not great...We each had a glass of wine.  No dessert for us...it was hot in there and the arches and decor reminded me of a taco bell.  I wouldn't even go back if it was a free meal:(

Finding a Family Doctor can be difficult and I have been having a rough time doing so since my former Doctor retired recently.  The requirements I had were... 1.  MD 2.  Office with one or two doctors...I hate when there are a bunch of people in the waiting room( especially gross sick ones ugh!). 3.  Friendly, staff that actually returns calls! 4.  Doctor that doesn't make you feel rushed and listens to your issues! 5.  Easy to access, not in a big building that is hard to park in. 6.  Available appointments.  Dr. Riley is all these things and more.  I'm  really happy with the ease and the great medical care.  His nurses are good with needles as well.  I had to get my blood taken and a few shots and she performed like a pro with confidence!  So, if you are in need of a new Doctor I highly recommend Dr. Riley.  I think they also take most insurances as well!

I just had a fantastic bean and cheese burrito.  The tortilla was so fresh and tasty.  The beans were creamy and well spiced.  There was the perfect amount of cheese.  The meal was fast was well priced and the staff was friendly.  The atmosphere was pleasant and clean.  Great place!!!

It's a bit expensive ...but nice.  They keep the place clean and up to date.  The equipment  is the latest and the greatest available.  There is a lot you can do  swim, work out, play squash, tennis and there are loads of classes to take.  I like the zumba and the yoga...the food is nice and so is the pool.  There are always good looking people and it is pretty busy.  Overall one of the best places around to belong!

These donuts are the best ever!   I don't care if they shorten my life 5 minutes...it's worth it!  You can taste every light and creamy, fluffy layer when you bite down into a chocolate long john...with just the right amount of delightful chocolate on top!   Try a buttermilk bar...crispy on the outside lite and tasty in the middle...there are no better in this town!  O boy do I want one right now!

Super fresh, cheap price, high quality, big portions...these things don't usually go together...but they do at Sakana.  This is a nice little local joint that is busy, so you know the sushi is fresh out of the ocean.  They have an excellent lunch special where it is around 12 dollars and you get salad and about 10 big pieces of sushi...pretty amazing!  Also, if you don't dig sushi they have great bento boxes that have really great salmon and chicken.  Check this place out you will be pleased!

I was excited to go here because of all of the great things I have heard about Lamar...but I was disappointed :(  It all started with a pushy tour of the place and I wasn't impressed because it felt a bit dirty and old.  Then the next scary thing was a very crooked eyebrow wax that looked really strange...followed by an even worse massage.  I would be willing to try it again because so many people love this place but I just haven't been brave enough!

I love this place!  My favorite girls are Kim and Min.  They do a spectacular job.  Always spotless...and consistant!  These girls are friendly, painless and give a great foot massage.  If you like a flower painted and an impeccible French mani or pedi this is your place!!!

I love this place!  If you want to buzz in and shoot a few rounds of ammo and get in and out rapidly or stay a while this is the spot!  It's always busy but never too crowed to get in.  They have expert and helpful staff.  It always feels safe as they keep a close eye on people who don't know what they are doing or if you look crazy:)  Try it out...I enjoy it so much I became a member...it's the only way to go!

Everything here rocks!  Excellent java...iced or hot and they will give you a roader...I had eggs over medium...cooked perfect with a nice buttery taste, a crazy great piece of grilled turkey...IDK what it was but so darn tasty, fresh fruit and the cranberry toast...oooo I want it now!!! My mates had choc chip pancakes and they were tasty, fluffy and so yummy!  The home fries were awesome as well...this was a fantabulous foodtastic time!

I love this place!  They have great sales on super fabulous awesome steaks!  I bought some Ribeyes that were seriously much better than AJ's and 75% less!  The chicken is organic and seriously it does taste better...and it was super reasonable as well.  The market has great vegies and odd stuff that is difficult to find other places.  The help is really helpful and friendly.  All in all it's a great experience!

High Tea...this is one of the best in the valley!  The beautiful environment, piano playing, and exquisite service is topped by no other place.  The chairs are so comfortable and the china so fine.  We started with high quality Darjeling tea followed by an array of tea sandwiches including egg salad, cucumber cream cheese, smoked salmon and a few others.  You can eat as many as you want!  The next course was two scones a plain and a cranberry served with delightful lemon curd, fresh strawberry jam  and my favorite clotted cream that was whipped!  The last course is the desserts.  Mini chocolate cake, raspberry cake,  lemon dessert,  chocolate covered strawberries and shortbread!  It's a nice place for a birthday they sing and make a big deal with extra dessert...  We left full and pleased!

I really love this place and could eat here every other day!  The chicken tacos crispy are my favorite.  The meat is so tender and flavorful and the cheese is fresh, fluffy and not too salty.  Also, the green corn tamales are better than any I've had.  Always fresh and light and simply outrageous!  The bean and cheese burrito is crazy good too.  The tortillas are the most delightful around.  Very inexpensive and it is locally owned.  The same staff has been there for years and always is friendly and remembers me and that is a nice thing!

We really wanted some indian food...so we went to Jewel of the Crown for take out.  It was Saturday night and there were about 20 people dining so we felt like at lease some people were eating there.  We ordered shish kabob...it ended up being dried up and spiced oddly...we could not stomach eating it.  The vegie korma was ok but had huge...not bite size vegies in it.  Like really large carrot pieces and like whole quarters of potato.  The Chicken tiki masala was pretty good the chicken was tender and the sauce was pretty nice.  The rice and nan were fine.    I guess we were expecting something really great and it was so so...next time we will try a different place until we find an Indian place that is better:(

Iv'e been going to Don and Charlies for years and it is always consistently been quite good.  Last night I had the baby back ribs.  I order them well done and they are moist yet crispy.  The sauce is a little sweet and a little spicy.  Coleslaw creamy style and the twice baked are home runs!  Don't forget to ask for the chopped liver and rye bread, it is the best I've had.  The chicken snitzle is a good option if you want to try something new.  If you get take out check your bags...things seem to get left off.

Like the quaint atmosphere really cute!  Out door seating that is nice during the cooler times of year.  I eat here often and everything is a hit!  If you just want some tacos theirs are an A plus...the meat juicy and tender in the chicken tacos and the chili relleno  is the best around.  The chips are so fresh...and the salsa is spicy but not too hot.  A nice place for a date ...have a margarita, enjoy a great dinner and then walk around the galleries...a night to remember!

Delicious Chicken Parm...we mostly get it for take out.  The piece of chicken is huge, moist and amazing.  It comes with a big side of pasta, an amazing cesaer salad and bread.  They deliver as well..so if you don't even want to get up off the couch...this is one excellent call.  If you want to eat in...if you a girl...go in looking great because all of the waiters are really good looking with very in shape bodies...it is eye candy for you and tummy filling great too!

Best take out or eat in sushi!  Josh and Jesus'  make the most amazing, freshest and fastest to order sushi around!  The sushi is well priced for the volume.  They have everything you would want to order available.   We love the spicy tuna rolls, edamame and hot green tea.  Tip large these guys deserve it!

It's a simple...but dirty, cheap pleasure...a bean burrito at taco bell!  Inexpensive, always the same since I was a kid, always fresh,hot and delicious in its own sick way.  I'm not embarrassed to admit this...but don't hold it against me:)  Whenever I want to do a little sneaky binge look for my car here...don't forget to order the mini churros...not a good date food;0

I recently called there to speak to a salesperson so I could look at a Jeep Patriot and a Liberty.  I told the salesperson I would be there in one hour and gave him my name and phone number.  We arrived on time and asked for the salesperson who had been standing around with the others in front.  It took him 20 minutes to find the car and then he told me it needed gas!  I told both him and his sales manager...what have you been standing around "scratching your ......and now you are wasting my time?  I know that's terrible...but I was irritated at how lame they were.  So after we test drove the cars I asked them to email me some prices on 3 cars and I was interested in purchasing one of them within the week.  They never did!  I'm not sure why they wouldn't take us seriously as we drove up in a BMW x5...?  Then two days later the guy calls me and says...um call us if you are interested in a test drive...what the heck!    These guys are a combo of lazy and a bit dumb...I guess maybe I can get a good deal out of them if I can ever get them to give me information!  I say skip it and let the Darwinian Theory work and they will starve!

How they make those meatless chocolate chip cookies will always amaze me!!!   Well maybe I came in with high expectations and that led to disappointment...But seriously if I want meatballs...I shouldn't be a vegetarian...so why would I want "mock balls"...they were strange...I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth...The gratin dip was this liquidy green goo to be eaten with corn chips...disgusting...crab puffs...who needs pho-crab...how about a pizza that has fake cheese on it?  It was so doughy and odd...kinda like something at a school cafeteria...how is this so natural and green...fake things that are supposed to be like the real thing...how about just some great tasting food that doesn't include animal products?  Believe me no animals were harmed in creating this meal...unless someone brings home a doggy bag for Rover!!!  Ugh...I'm still feeling green from this meal!  This is a slap in the face to vegans...vegan food should be tasty and fresh...not contrived!  It's time to shine the light on this "Emperor's Clothes"!   I like the idea of a vegan restaurant...but I prefer the idea of great tasting food!

Sauce is a great Quick Serve place.  I had the Chix Caesar Salad it was large and filling and quite good.  The sangria is nice as well...I like the koolaid touch around the edge of the glass.  My man had the bruchetta caprese style and it was awesome...the tomatoes were perfectly ripe and the mozzarella was fresh and creamy.  The bread was a really crusty yet fluffy yet able to hold up to the mix piece of wonder...we found out they get it from LaBrea.  If you want a great quick lunch or dinner check it out...we look forward to trying the pizza and pasta next time!

Always super hot, tasty, fresh and cheesy!  They deliver in my area as well and it's a nice change up from pizza!...this is the real thing...they have the "wiz" if that is how you prefer it!  It's a bit of a dive, so don't let that scare you...the place has been around for a while.  The fries and sweet tater fries are some of the best around!  Open 24 hours as well is another bonus for those late night munchies...I think I'll head there now!

Fun store to go to...they do this hand treatment that is amazing!  it's a must go to...they rub your hands with scrub, lotion and oils leaving them feeling simply amazing.  They also have a yummy lip treatment that leaves your lips feeling smooth and very kissable.  Prices are reasonable and I usually leave with some kind of body lotion, lip treatment or scrub...and smelling real great!   Check it out!

Super fresh...super fun and super fantastic!  We ate there tonite and the sushi was really delish!  We had the spyder roll which is one of the best that I've had around.  Also, the spicy tuna is great...it has a sauce on it that puts it over the top!  The portions are large which...I love!  They have a happy hour that makes it much more affordable...try the rainbow roll for desert!  Ladies you will really love it!

I feel sad to say this...because I know it is locally owned by a small family...but yucko!  I went there to lunch hesitantly, but my friend wanted to go there.    The place felt old and dirty, too big for too few people and too quiet.  I had the egg salad sandwich.  It was bland and boring and served between two slices of stale white bread.  My friend got a chicken salad and I could tell it was disgusting...she barely made her way through it.  The ice tea was ok....but it was really disappointing and I fear it is on it's last leg unless some changes are made:(

If you love hair bows and have been having to make them or order them over the net...you've met your match!  Bows in every size, shape, color and style...it's the bow mecca!  If you have little girls or if you are a big girl who loves to do fun hair styles with bows Basically bows is a must see! They aren't too expensive but if you go crazy it can add up!

The best Green pork chile stew in town!  The pork is tender and succulent, the dish is spicy, but not too spicy...and there is no better around.  The corn bread is fantastic as well!  I simply adore the chocolate chip cookies!  I love both these items and even though I've been here multiple times I haven't tried anything else because of my love affair with these items!  The atmosphere is charming and really comfortable.  If Aaron the owner is there he is really nice and friendly.  Get there soon!

I hope my trainer doesn't see this...But I love sprinkles and I love all of the flavors that they have especially the dark chocolate and the red velvet.  I love them with a big glass of ice cold whole milk!  My dog even enjoys the pup cakes...twitter with them and get the password of the day and get a free one!  I love this place!

Humble Pie really shouldn't be Humble any more...this place is awesome now!    House made Burrata...house made mozzerella...fabulous meatballs, tasty sauce on the pizzas, wild mushroom mix...the pizza, caprese are both amazing...great service and speedy for take out.  We tried the wings and they are so so...but everything else was extraordinary.    Don't hesitate this place has been remarkable the 3 times I have visited recently!

Mrs. Paul's...look out!  This place is disgusting!  I couldn't even taste the fish...and then again maybe that was fortunate.  The Trout Almondine that was said to be fresh had large pieces of almonds, lots of breading and soaked in butter.  There were carrots and green beans on the side similar to the ones you get in a frozen dinner.  The Dover sole was so breaded it should have been called "chicken fried sole"...we could barely choke it down.  What we did manage to swallow left us feeling sick and nautious.  It was almost what you would expect from a hospital cafeteria!  It was mostly people 70 plus...do people lose their taste buds when they get older?!?  We saw several people with really tacky toupes too!  This place isn't inexpensive...I just don't get it!  I can only say don't waste your calories, time or money all that you can never get back:)

... it's one of the best spas I have ventured to in the world!  Beautiful, serene, peaceful and with intent.  This is like a tribute to the finest in spa land.  From arrival to departure every detail is well thoughtout all leading to the perfect experience.  The massage I had was unbeatable.  The sheets on the table were the silkiest and I look forward to purchasing some. The warming pads were so cozy. The hour and a half was spectacular.  I felt like a new girl...my body was renewed.   Best experience and massage I have had!     Pool side was enjoyable and lunch was so tasty.  I can't wait to come back!   Spend your money here it is well worth every bit of it!!!

I sure hope my trainer Bill Crawford at Basic Training doesn't follow my reviews!  I know I shouldn't be eating Bundt  Cakes but I don't care!  These cakes are so moist and scrumptious there is nothing like them!  I recently had the blueberry one and it was really tasty.  My favorite is red velvet it is rich and has cream cheesy icing on top. Seriously, if you need to impress, thank or present someone with the best cake ever...this is the place!   I wish I had a wedge now!

This was a flat tire for me too.:(  It seemed like it would be a great idea but the service was less then hospitable, the food was portioned for a small mouse...and it was boring and literally thrown on a plate.  If this place wants to be a player it needs to get something better to wash down the wine with!

TWinkle Tan Rocks!  I look super tan and super awesome!  It takes 20 minutes and it lasts 10 solid days...so for a special event or just anytime you want to look sun kissed with out the sun burn...try this place.  I've tried other fake bakes that don't last or are uneven.  This tan isn't stinky either.  Bree the owner really cares and does a fabulous job.

I've been on a real bender lately...and this Fried Chicken was worth it!...I got the Betty Boop which is a huge fried chicken breast with a super fresh and tasty waffle...the chicken was juicy, moist and perfectly fried!  I smothered my waffle in the butter and syrup and need I say more...this was paradise!  I complimented my meal with a super sized mason jar of red koolaid and it was the perfect thing to wash this meal down with!  You have to get the Red Velvet cake it's a must have!!! This is a super fun place to go!

OMG OMG OMG...This was some seriously good grub!  We had a party of 30 tonight on the patio and the staff was amazing.  They were helpful setting up the party and sosososo accommodating.  The chef actually called to apologize that they couldn't make something.  We ordered several kinds of Bruchetta...the Apple and Brie with Fig Jam was KILLER, the traditional tomato and basil one was so tasty it was like it was just out of the garden, there was a steak with horseradish sauce that was out of this world.  We also had calamari fried, wings and hummus which were all top notch.  Where they get their bread...I need to know!  There were so many excellent wines to choose from, the water was even good as well and was served in a quaint old fashioned milk bottle.  On the patio there was a musician who played a guitar and sang who is worth going back for alone!  The place is well appointed has cool art, comfy seating  and nice bathrooms too...  I can not say enough...you must go to 5th and Wine!

You have to visit this store!  If you love original products that are useful and beautiful check it out!  I recently purchased a back pack from here and took it all over Canada...hiking, biking, fishing and kayaking and it was a champion!  The compartments were great so I could protect my wallet in a crowd...there is a nice water bottle holder as well.  Most of all I can wash it and it is just like new!

Hurry and get there soon before it closes...if you want to waste a meal there...terrible, disgusting...it's like a school lunch one of the kids said...Taco Bell is much better...it's like airplane food another diner said...We had a steak arachera taco plate, enchiladas, taquitos and a bean burrito...the stale chips were an omen and I almost wanted to walk out then!  The food tasted bad like really crumby old leftovers.  The sauce on the enchiladas was like spaghetti sauce...IDK  if they just don't know what good food is...or they don't care!   Yuck, gross...puke!  Don't go and waste time or money at this poor excuse for a restaurant!  I feel bad for tourists who innocently wander in expecting a good meal and end up with this pile of slop!

Had some killer sushi for lunch at Stingray today!  The Crunchy Spicy Tuna Sushi is totally different than any where I have experienced it.  A well seasoned really combined tuna mixture sits atop a crispy rice rectangular tasty amazing thing!  You must order this...very special.  The Spyder Roll was super fresh and a nice big portion.  Shrimp Tempera Roll was delicious as well.  The atmosphere was fun and the service was speedy and friendly.  There were so many choices that sounded fabulous on the menu and we look forward to going there and experiencing many more items!

Sunrise Trail is really fabulous.  Not too crowded...not too out of the way.  The trail to hike is Lost Dog Trail or the the one near it.  It is beautiful, steep and a great workout.   The trail on 136th is like walking in a huge wash for miles and miles and then you hit the boulders and the rocks that you must scale...it gets difficult...I don't suggest that one.  I bring my dog Biggins...I pick up his poo...a lot of people don't and that part was disappointing...so if you bring your pup bring a bag and be willing to carry it back down ...please:)

We have been here about 10 times since it opened and usually it ranks as one of the best burgers in town!  We love the Kobe burger medium rare with a side of zuc fries.  The burger has a home made bun that is delicious...mushrooms and cheddar.  It is well seasoned and juicy...I'm talking double napkin!  Also, they have a Buffalo Chix sandwich that is one of the best.  The Chicken is juicy yet crispy on the outside...it is spicy so you need the ranch!  They will serve things protein style which is nice.  If you have room get the Kit Kat shake...they will split it if need be!  I left a star off because we went today and it wasn't nearly as good so I hope it was only a fluke!

Check this out!  We had lunch there last week...I wasn't sure because it seemed like a small place and wasn't always crowed...but I sure was wrong...the place became packed 15 minutes after we got there!  We had the Bree and Chicken Crepe and it was savory and tasty also the French Favorite which had Ham and Swiss and a fried egg on top...cooked perfectly!  We shared a dessert crepe with Nutella and banana and it was a home run!!!

We were excited to try this place as we have been hearing alot about it.  Lee's smells like a hospital and it's a bit of a turn-off to the appetite.  We tried to get past it and try a sample...the girl gave us barely a speck of ice cream and the bit we got tasted stale and freezer burned.  The girl kept saying you want some ice cream with alcohol? Come on we are adults it's not some big deal to get alcohol...ugh we left ...I give the place only a few months:(

Have you ever been excited because you want something to be great...and then it's...very disappointing:(  This is how the story went at Vatra!  It's almost like the owner is a home cook trying to go "pro".  We went for lunch and all signs started well...we were greeted upon entering the place, it was clean and nicely designed and decorated.  The menu had many items that were appealing.  The waitress took our order and the ice tea was well brewed and fresh, some absolutely freshly baked bread with some designer butter came out and we were thinking things were going well...until the steak chimichurri arrived!  What cut of meat it was ...i have no idea but it was under seasoned, undercooked and super chewy!  The chimichurri sauce lacked any flavor and this plate had some boring flavorless potato wedges.  Paella...I have no idea why they think this is anything like Paella...it was 6 pieces of overcooked seafood on a bed of dry yellow rice.  How the chef could taste this and think wow this is great is beyond me.   The deserts were boring and we were afraid to order them and have more mediocre fare.  I fear that there is no hope for Vatra and it is going to go down in flames.

Pretty enjoyable...especially for food court fare.  I enjoyed a little cheese burger all of the way...some well done fries and a drink from their super cool soda machine.  I like that they have vinegar for the fries...nice touch!  The burger was hot and fresh.  Very organized as well and speedy.  I say check it out...a good time and good value!

Chip and Ruby's is such a cute place!  It has ice cream cone chairs and fun games to play!  The staff was so nice to accommodate my daughter's birthday party of 25 people dropping by...they had balloons and made a special huge sunday with candles and even lead the singing...  Now let's get down to business...:)  The ice cream rocks!  The scooped ice cream is all fresh and home made and really natural and delicious.  It is served in really cool cone cup dishes...and although I'm not a quantity food person...I was glad the portions are large!  They have custard there and I'm looking forward to coming back soon and trying it!

Great meal there Saturday nite!  Our Waitress Allison was friendly, knowledgable and excellent at her job!  The environment was fun, nicely designed and comfortable.    The wine list was complete with many offerings and I liked how Allison had both myself and my hubby taste it before pouring it!  There were so many delicious sounding choice that it was difficult to choose...but we ordered the Shep's Pie and the Pork Confiet....both were fabulous, filling and unique!  We saved room for dessert and we loved the bread pudding and pecan fig pie...the coffee rocked as well!  Make sure you have a reservation the place was packed...and deserves to be!

This place is my new favorite...everything on the menu is really delicious!  I keep going back and trying different things and continue to be happy.  The food is kind of traditional but very high quality...no funny meat here...The short rib panang Neur...is my favorite as is the port shoulder!  I love the sticky rice!!! I only wish there was an Indian restaurant with these standards in our town:(

For a quick serve place this place is 5 stars!!!  Speedy, fresh and different! The un sandwich is wrapped in lettuce and is a fun change!  The chips are crunchy and mighty flavorful.  Even the drinks are special...the ice is really fine ...so the drink is like a slushy...also...drum roll ...they deliver!  This one is near my office...but a girl can dream that one will open by her home one day:)

Is it illegal to have good Chinese good in Arizona?  We went tonight having high hopes of having high quality, fresh Chinese food and we were sorely disappointed.:(  We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the order...we were going to give them a pass for that...but on the flavor issue...there are no excuses...  The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless.  The sauce that went with them could not revive them.  The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heat...Viagra needed:(!  The Mongolian Beef was so salty it tasted processed.  The snap peas were stringy and overcooked.  The General Chow's Chicken...it tasted old like it was off an all you can eat buffet.  Honestly...Panda Express is better...as least you know what to expect in a mall food court.  It wasn't cheap...and I'm not a food volume person but the portions were small...I was fine with it because who would want more of this plate of shame!  I hope they can get there act together...but I fear the owner may be in over his head...  Isn't there a Chinese Chef in town who needs  a job!

If I could turn back time and not have gone to La Petite France Bistro...I would.  It was terrible.  From the slow service to the iced tea that wasn't ice tea...and the waiter not even noticing no one at our table drank it...to the sick feeling I had after the meal:( The smoked salmon crepes were not edible.  They were salty and sickly fishy.  We hid them under the blob of lettuce they call a salad.  We also got their version of a pizza...it was at least palatable...but not worth bringing the left overs home.  Also, we had a Quiche Lorraine.  I felt like I was eating hospital food.  Again, we could eat it but it wasn't very good.  We wanted dessert...but I was scared to try anything further.    We had just had two great crepe experiences while traveling in San Fran and were looking forward to this.  I'm sorry to write this review as I think it is a individual owner trying to make a go of things...but I think this place needs to revamp before it becomes a casuality.  I only think it is fair to warn others so no one else wastes time, money and calories on this joint.

This was our second trip here.  The first one was rather good...the second one...ugh...I am not going back.   We ordered the gnochi...which we were then told they were out of or maybe we had the menu from another night?  We heard other tables with the same issue... saying...mmm why didn't you tell me before.  And frankly...everyone was ordering that because the other items sounded mediocre.  We started with the Foi Gras...it was thinly sliced and over done and seriously a portion that would be perfect for the miniture museum...no thanks...  Next, how about a Burrata Caprese with...a beautiful combo of mealy or unripe tomatoes...I wouldn't serve them in my own home...either run to the store...crazy chef...or take it off the menu.  The Burrata was slimey and sour and the pesto was liquified...gag me.  The Chianti was good but after one glass...they had run out...  The Mushroom Polenta was nice and enjoyable.  The Papradelle was terrible...we saw plates of it heading back to the dish washer quite full...I hope they get the hint.  It was a conglomeration of flavors all mashed together forming an unpleasant taste and texture...  The Beet Salad was fine not bad...not good.  I can only comment that I value every moment of my life too much to have meals that are just so so like this.  The wait staff was awkward, clumsy and just not well trained...  We got out without dessert  and didn't want to risk another moment or calorie at this restaurant...I can only think that the chef has surely gone crazy to think people will  return for this lack luster experience.
