I have not only experienced defective and faulty dental services from Dr. Price, but as a patient I was met with nasty and rude customer service from her staff and therefore this yelp review is warranted. Around 2010 I started seeing Dr. Price. I was told almost instantly that I needed a crown replacement. I went ahead with it, but afterwards the tooth she replaced was in pain and it felt as if the crown didn't fit properly.  Dr. Price replaced the new crown and it solved the problem; I was happy with this outcome.  A few years later I was told that another tooth needed a crown.  The same thing happened, the tooth felt like it was not fitting properly, I was in pain and could not chew normally on the tooth. I expressed my concern and told the hygienist that I thought it was a similar situation as to what happened before. This time, without looking at it first or even trying to adjust it, I was referred to go see a specialist (of her choosing) to discuss a root canal. I had no previous problems with this tooth and again had experienced this once before with a similar procedure she had performed.  I expressed my displeasure with this solution.  There was no root canal needed.  In the meantime, I was on vacation in NYC and the crown fell completely off; it was only one year old. I had to take an entire day of my vacation to get the tooth re-cemented. Not to mention the whole day before I was in pain due to tooth sensitivity.  Once I returned home I had another dentist xray and examine the tooth.  It was determined that the fit was not ideal and that it was leaking, thus causing a bad taste in my mouth as well as the sensitivity.  Because it has been under 5 years since this crown has been placed, my insurance company will not pay for a replacement.  I have written three formal letters to Dr. Price since September of 2014 requesting a refund on this tooth so that I may have it replaced.  I have received not so much as a phone call from them. When I called last week I was told by the receptionist that this more or less was my fault and should I take formal action against them, "not to worry, they have good records". That sounds like a threat to me. All I want is a new tooth so that I can eat without being in pain for the first time in three years. However, I am not comfortable seeing this dentist anymore.

I saw Dr. Romine's office for a few years for acne maintenance. Eventually I decided to see one of her aestheticians for a light chemical peel.  This light peel ended up scabbing over most of my face mainly on the sides near my cheeks. I went back to  them after it started to get more severe and was told by Dr. Romine that I was actually lucky because I was getting the result of a more aggressive, more expensive peel. What I wasn't given was the proper instruction and/or topical treatment for this type of peel which has subsequently left me with the darkening and scarring of my face. I went back 6 or so months later with these same concerns and was told that I have a skin condition and that it was not caused by the peel. However, I know that it was.  Seeing as this is a dermatology office, I felt confident getting this type of procedure.  I understand that sometimes things don't go as planned, but not taking accountability for these things is a different story.  Maybe I could have taken some sort of legal action, which I did not,  but would like others to be aware before deciding to get a treatment like this from them.

I love Salon D'Shayn. I have been going to the Old Town location for years as a waxing client of D'Lisa. I will never go anywhere else for a wax because D'Lisa is the best so I continued to drive to Scottsdale. Now that the Phoenix location is open I am going to see her there and I LOVE it! The place is beautiful and to top it off, I can now get my nails done there as well. They have the best selection of gellish colors and foils. Dawnisha is an awesome nail tech. Vanessa is an amazing stylist and if you are a man, check out Brit the Barber!  They have an amazing team at Salon D'Shayn Phoenix!
