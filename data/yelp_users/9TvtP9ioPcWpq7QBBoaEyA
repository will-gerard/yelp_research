I would rate this store 0 stars if it were an option. Came in to purchase a new phone and waiting about 45 minutes to even be talked to about my options (already a poor start). When I finally received service, the gentleman was extremely confused about trade in and had to find somebody else to help him (seems like poor training to me). Then I waited for him to set up my new phone, handed him my credit card and was told I needed a different card because the card I gave him (with my matched ID) didn't match the address on the account. I told him that the account is in somebody else's name and I could give him my proper billing information. He told me "No, we're getting ready to close" so I asked to talk to a manager and he told me "My manager can't help you". Glad I didn't give them my phone because I will now be switching phone providers all thanks to this store!

The food is good but that's about the only thing this streets of NY has going for them. Not only am I disappointed in the constant late deliveries and my food being right only half the time but I recently had time to speak to the general manager who is equally disappointed. I told him that the wrong order was no problem and I'm over it and instead of apologizing, he went on to tell me about how I should have ordered my item differently. Next time I'll just order my pizza at NYPD - but thanks anyway!

What a terrible experience this was. None of the lights in the parking were on although it's dark outside. Furthermore they have two cashiers working so a trip to the store that should have taken 5 minutes took 15 because of the line. Cashier was snotty on top of that. Never again!

We are forever customers of AG! Their wine selection is spectacular and always a perfect match for their fantastic filet. Try the calamari as a starter, you won't regret it!! Yum!

This was our first time here and it was WONDERFUL! Service was great and every staff member was incredibly friendly. We got the chicken fried steak, country Benedict, and French toast and all three of us left full and happy! Even after we finished and we were just chatting, the server came back to check on us regularly, refill coffee, etc. 5 stars without a doubt!

Delicious! Onion rings and fries were both perfect! We also had a BLT which was so yummy. Will be back!

We are so very impressed with Yellowtail and already can't wait to come back! Service was, however, EXTREMELY slow. We waited over 5 minutes for drinks and over 10 minutes just for our check. We were also told we couldn't get the happy hour price because our server rang in a large sake to share instead of two small, which was disappointing. We got another tables sushi order and the server never came to tell us or apologize. I'm under the impression our server was very new.. Therefore we aren't giving up because of the service flaws. Excellent food!!

This is a new find for us and after a few visits I'm definitely impressed. The food is stellar and the service is always good. The Louie roll is my new favorite! The only reason for not giving this place 4 stars is the price of sake bombs during happy hour. You can get a sake bomb for half the price with sushi that is just as good about a mile away. Otherwise, phenomenal restaurant!

This place is garbage. I live right around the corner and have given them countless tries but it is constant disappointment. The last two times I went, I didn't receive the towel or air freshener that is advertised with the $9 wash. If you are lucky enough to have an employee standing there to guide you on the tracks, don't count on them actually paying attention to whether or not your wheels will hit the metal. Their vacuums rarely work. In addition, tonight they decided they wanted to go home early so even though their hours show open until 6pm, they took all of their vacuums apart at 520. Your money is better spent at one of the other 900 car washes in the valley.

Really disappointed with the changes in this restaurant. This place used to be a go to and unfortunately after my last experience I can't see myself going back. We ordered a flatbread, burger, and pasta. The burger was the only item that had any kind of seasoning. The rest was just so bland. The fries that came with the burger were wonderful!  The biggest issue for us was really the service. Between the fact that the server forgot half the things we asked for and her constant rolling her eyes. She was just plain rude and took almost 20-30 minutes to get anything you asked for (refill, the check, etc). Such a bummer that such a wonderful restaurant is now so lame
