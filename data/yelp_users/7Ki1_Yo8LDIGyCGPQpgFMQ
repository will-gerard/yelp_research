I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest, so I'm really picky about Asian food.  Wild Thaiger is fantastic, mostly authentic, Thai food.  For the less adventurous, the pad thai is delicious and unlike what you get at most Thai restaurants in the valley.  For those with a more adventurous palate, the Pad Cha seafood dish is spectacular.  Be careful if you order Thai hot..they mean business here.  The desserts are also fantastic.  For the best service, check it out for lunch on a weekday.  Service can be a little slow for dinner, but still good.

I've been coming to Rainbow for years.  They do a good job cleaning my stuff, and they are reasonably priced.  The staff is friendly and I've never had a problem getting any issues I have resolved with them.

The staff and service at Runner's Den can't be beat.  Every time I have gone into this place, the staff is incredibly knowledgeable about the products they sell.  Last night, one guy gave me a detailed comparison between different types of cushioning in two pairs of shoes I was thinking about buying.  You just can't get that kind of info from big box stores.  They also look at your feet, your running gate, etc. to make sure that you're getting the right kind of shoe for your running abilities.  You pay a little extra, and the selection can be somewhat limited, but it's well worth it for the service Runner's Den offers.

As many of you know, it ain't easy getting good Chinese food in Phoenix.  Super Dragon is really one of the only places that does it right for my taste.  The employees are very friendly and provide excellent service.  The food is always good, and it comes out fast.  I haven't ordered take-out from them, but I have some friends who have and they say it's quick and efficient.  They have a pretty good list for their inexpensive lunch menu.  The dinner offerings are more extensive, and offer a good selection--especially if you like family-style dining.

Beautiful city park right in the middle of this desert metropolis.  Tons of awesome trails for running and hiking.  Very friendly for cyclists too.  The San Juan road is closed to motorized vehicles, which is great for cyclists.  Also, they do Silent Sundays, where the whole park is closed to motorized vehicles.  The views from the summit can't be beat!

I had an iPhone with a manufacturer defect--a common one--so I made an appointment at 7pm earlier this week.  I got to the store, which was completely chaotic, went to the genius bar and tried to get the attention of someone.  That took about 10 minutes.  Once I did get the attention of one of the employees, they told me to go check in with another employee across the store.  Sigh.  So I go and check in with that employee, who tells me to go stand by a table so that someone else will be able to come find me and help.  As I'm standing by the table, the store manager comes by and tells me the name of the genius who is going to help me.  Of course, that genius winds up getting too busy with another customer, so some other dude comes over to "help" me.  I have now been waiting for a half hour.  I show him the problem with my phone.  He asks me if my phone is more than a year old.  I tell him I'm not sure.  He looks up my serial number, and in 15 seconds determines that I am just shy of 2 months out of warranty.  He then tells me to buy a new iPhone at full price.  No discussion was held regarding the possibility of fixing my phone.  No suggestions were made about the implications of device protection insurance.  I walked out of the store fuming.  ...and I went to the Verizon store across the street.  They promptly informed me that my phone was covered under the insurance I had with them, and that they would happily send me a new iPhone at no cost right away.  Problem solved.  It's a cold day in Hell when you can get better service from Verizon than from Apple.  Guess it's going to snow in Phoenix pretty soon.

Went to Cafe Lalibela for the first time today for lunch.  The lunch special was very reasonably priced, and offered a taste of several Ethiopian dishes.  Very tasty food at a good price? Yes please.  I'll be coming back for more very soon!

Only recently getting into the Arizona sports scene.  I've been here for a few Coyote's games this season.  Love this place!  I wish there was a little more variety in the concessions, but that's my only gripe.  The way that it's situated in Westgate is awesome.

Every time I go to Vegas, I do my best to get out of the airport as quickly as possible.  And for good reason (other than my overwhelming desire to go gamble away my life savings).  There is NOTHING to do in this airport other than play slot machines and catch flights.  There are no good restaurants; nowhere to comfortably sit and enjoy and adult beverage; no good shops.  One time I got trapped in McCarran for over 5 hours during a monsoon storm.  I wanted to gouge my eyes out I was so bored.  I get it--the powers that be want you to go to the Strip and spend your money as fast as possible.  But God help you if you get stuck there like I did.

Friendly, fun, hip environment with good food and tasty drinks.  Good drink specials daily.  I've been coming to Fez for a couple years now, and I'll say the only thing that is consistently lacking is the service.  While servers generally get your order right, it can be painfully slow at times.  This is more of a dinner spot for me.  For lunch? I just don't have time for that.

Copper Star is far and away my favorite local coffee shop.  It's everything that I want in a local coffee shop.  The staff are super friendly and have a fun quirky artsy hipster vibe.  Yes, that's one specific vibe.  The owner, Bill, is often there and is a super friendly local guy.    The coffee is really good.  Both the brewed coffee and the espresso beverages are very smooth.  The coffee they serve is not roasted to death, so it isn't nearly as bitter or biting as the coffee served at a certain multinational coffee mega corporation we all know.    The pastries and cakes are out of this world.  They bake them in an open kitchen that you can see as you order.  I have never been disappointed by a single baked item I've purchased here.  There is sometimes live music.  The crowd is friendly and local.  Free WiFi.  Great spot to sit and read, socialize with friends, or go for a first meeting.  Can't get enough of it.

Wag N Wash is my go-to place for specialty pet items.  They have a great selection of high quality pet foods, treats, toys, and accessories.  They've even got a bakery for pet treats.  I take my dog here regularly for grooming as well.  The employees are really friendly and you can tell they genuinely enjoy animals.

This place is so awesome that I literally can't stand to see movies at any other theater now.  I feel like I'm in international first class when I sit in the higher end "Cinema Suites."  I feel like I'm in my living room recliner with a server when I'm in the "Fork and Screen."  So basically, it's awesome.  Most comfortable theater in the Valley hands down.  The food and drinks are pretty good, and not insanely expensive either.  I can't stop going back.

Hazelwoods is a great neighborhood sports bar.  The staff is very friendly.   So is the crowd of Arcadians that come here.  Big beer and drink specials every night.  The nachos are tasty.  Check out the Team Trivia a few nights a week.

I eat Thai 3 or 4 days a week.  I generally spend at least one of those days at Thai Basil.  It's a really great spot for a quick lunch because they are FAST.  There's a good selection of lunch special items.  All the food is fresh, hot, and tasty.  The appetizer salad that they serve has a dressing that makes my life worth living.

I really like Maizie's.  I make my way there at least once a month for lunch or brunch.  Weekends have fun drink specials on make your own Mimosas and the like.  The staff are always very friendly and helpful.  The food is always good.  The Chioptle aioli is all I want on my french fries ever.  Also, they have a nice dog friendly patio.  They'll even give your dog water and treats--really great people!

Occasionally I get a craving for ice cream.  Occasionally.  And Pink Spot is a great local place in my neighborhood.  The staff are extremely friendly and let you sample pretty much anything you want.  It has a coffee-shop/cafe type of feel, and serves ice cream.  Awesome.  They also have a really interesting selection of flavors.  They usually do a special flavor (not sure if they do that weekly or monthly), and sometimes they're pretty far out.  One time I had lobster ice cream.  No joke.  Gotta love the quirkiness.

America's Taco Shop knows how to make some darn good carne asada. You can't go wrong here if you order anything with carne asada. They recently started offering chicken too. The bean and cheese burrito is delicious if you're looking for a meatless option. Daily specials, reasonable prices, and a good happy hour. My only complaint is that the tortilla chips aren't very good--often taste a little stale. If you get them, make sure to get the spicy salsa. It's not that spicy and it's a big improvement over the regular salsa. The "cochata"--coffee + Horchata--is awesome!

I love Tempe Beach Park.  They host a wide range of events throughout the year.  From triathlons to salsa festivals, this is a great spot.  It's also convenient and close to the light rail for those beer festivals.

Caveat: I didn't get my hair cut here.  I was with my buddy who was getting ready for his wedding and the people at Floyd's were helping him get all gussied up.  But I would definitely get my hair cut here.  The stylists were all really friendly.  The decor and music selection was awesome.  I wish it was closer to where I live.

Love this hidden little local bar.  Really great selection of beers and specialty cocktails.  Interesting mix of sophisticated clientele.  If you're looking to get a little dressed up to go out, you won't feel out of place here at all.  They play funky old scifi movies on the TVs and feature some cool work by local artists.  They make a very tasty Moscow Mule.  Or, if you're feeling crazy, they serve Absinthe with fire.

This Scottsdale location of the national chain does not disappoint.  The entire dining experience is very upscale.  The vast array of meats are all very well prepared by their excellently trained staff.  Each of the servers in the restaurant are able to help you, so service is always very fast and top-notch.  Who doesn't love a prix fixe menu of delectable meats?  The salad bar is also outstanding.  They make a mean caipirinha too.

I'm a huge fan of Upward Projects restaurants/concepts.  This is my local Postino, and I've been coming here since it opened a couple years ago.  The crowd is a good mix of Central Phoenicians--ranging from the young and hip, to the middle aged and upscale.  The staff and service are great.  Knowledgeable about the wines they serve, and excited about the menu items.  Check it out on Mon or Tues after 8pm for the $20 bottle and board special.

I eat here at least once a week.  It is delicious, and cheap.  You can't beat a lunch for under $5.  The spring rolls and the #12 beef pho are good if you're looking for a basic meal.  The cafe sua da is delicious, but you have to be patient for the coffee to drip down.  If you're looking to test your manliness, challenge yourself with #54.

I had a great experience at this store earlier this week.  I had an iPhone with a manufacturer defect.  I took it to the Apple store first--big mistake.  Apple made me wait for a half hour (even though I had a scheduled appointment).  They took a 15 second look at my phone, determined that I was 2 months outside of the warranty, and told me to buy a new iPhone at full price.  Not.  Cool.  Enraged, I went to this Verizon store across the street from Chandler Mall.  The sales staff was very helpful and respectful of my frustration with my device.  They took a quick look at my plan, saw that I had device protection (who knew? Guess I should read my bill more carefully!)  They got a new replacement phone mailed to me within two days.  Completely painless.  I thought it would be a cold day in Hell before I got better service from Verizon than from Apple, but I'm very happy I was wrong.

This place is pretty much everything I'm looking for from a Starbucks.  Good, standard drinks.  Very friendly staff who remember my name and my order.  Always clean and definitely one of the busier Starbucks locations in the Valley.  Parking in the relatively small attached lot can be tricky at times because they share it w/ a Pei Wei and Sidebar.

Another hit for the Upward Projects people.  Friendly staff, delicious menu, great space...this place has it all.  The patio is beautiful for warm AZ nights, and it's dog friendly too.  Check out the pretzel fondue, and the Joe's church potatoes.  Bloody Mary bar for weekend brunch is pretty great too.  Plus, it's next to Churn for your sweet tooth.

I love the Crescent Ballroom.  It's a very small venue where you can have the chance to see some really amazing artists.  I have been to 4 concerts there this year, and every one was fantastic.  I love that they have a bar inside the concert area.  The attached restaurant is also delicious.  You will recognize the food from Gallo Blanco, which is one of my personal favorites in Phoenix.  The happy hour specials are pretty good.  I also had the chance to check out a free flamenco performance there this past Saturday.  It was so cool!  They perform weekly, and I highly recommend checking it out.

Mediocre food. The beer selection is somewhat extensive, but odd. On my last trip, it took, I kid you not, 30 minutes to get a server to come and take a drink order. There were approximately 50 customers in the place at the time, ie NOT busy at all. Two servers came and helped tables on either side of our group, but both completely ignored the table of thirsty people. Then, one came up with an order for another table, asked if it was for us (there was NOTHING on our table, not even water or silverware). When we told her it wasn't our order, she walked away with a puzzled look on her face. Didn't even bother to ask if we had been helped or wanted something. You're right, we could have walked up to the bar and asked for drinks, but at this point the service was so ridiculously bad that it was comical to watch it unfold naturally. The only reason they don't get 1 star is because they have bowls and water for dogs on the patio. At least they get to drink, even if you don't.  Gotta give them props for that.

I took about a 7 month hiatus from OHSO.  I was dragged back kicking and screaming for a friend's birthday this last Friday.    They have a happy hour which apparently ends at 6pm.  Fine.  We got there around 6:05 and ordered a few pitchers of beer.  I will continue to give them praise for their beer selection.  My beer was very tasty.  Our server came by and asked us if we'd like any appetizers to start with.  I had seen on the happy hour menu that they serve a pretzel cheese fondue type thing. During happy hour (which ends at 6), this app is like $3 or something.  It is now 6:13pm.  I ask if I can have the pretzel cheese fondue thingy....aaaannnd....wait for it...wait for it....our server says NO!   I, of course, assume that there is some sort of miscommunication on my part.  I tell her that I fully recognize that I cannot have the pretzel fondue thingy for the $3 happy hour price.  It's 6:13 after all, and the happy hour ends at 6.  So I ask again.  AGAIN SHE SAYS NO!    Undeterred and extremely desirous of the pretzel fondue thingy, I say, Look, I know I can't get it for $3.  Can't I pay you some exorbitant price and get it?  AGAIN SHE SAYS NO!!!  She says the pretzel fondue thingy is ONLY AVAILABLE DURING HAPPY HOUR.  WHAT?!  She then proceeds to tell me that I can wait until 10pm when Happy Hour starts again and order it.  WHAT?!  THE MICROWAVABLE PRETZEL FONDUE FAIRY IS TAKING A 4 HOUR BREAK OR SOMETHING?!  Ok. Ok. Ok.  I get that sometimes you can't order the thing you want.  I get it.  Breakfast at 10pm when you're not at a Denny's? Fine. I understand.  BUT THIS IS A PRETZEL!  A pretzel that was available 13 minutes ago and will be available in another 3 hours and 47 minutes!!!  Crestfallen, I ordered some pesto hummus, a cheese burger, and a couple more pitchers of beer.  All were perfectly fine.  But all I really wanted was my pretzel cheese fondue thingy.  I have never offered to pay more for something and been denied.  Like, literally never in my life.  Why OHSO? Why do you so desperately want me to hate you?

This is not a good location. Incredibly busy, and very very slow staff. If there's a fax order ahead of you, be prepared to WAIT because they can't possibly make your burrito and put together a quesadilla for somebody who won't be coming in for another 20 minutes. The only reason to come here is the convenience of the location. Otherwise, avoid it.

I'm a huge fan of all the Upward Projects restaurants, but Postino is by far my favorite.  I've been to all the Postino locations a bunch of times.  Gilbert is actually my favorite location.  Compared to the others, the space here is huge. They've done it up in a cool modern industrial design style.  Large garage doors open to the outside for those beautiful 80 degree nights we have in the Valley.  The crowd is surprisingly young and hip for Gilbert (sorry).  If I didn't know better, I'd think I was in Central Phoenix.  They've got ample outdoor patio space.  It's great for a romantic one-on-one evening, or for a large group of people.  Check it out on Monday and Tuesday nights after 8 for the Bottle and Board special.

Waited in line for a little over an hour to get in.  There's also an option to pay $15/person to bypass the first line (yeah, there are two lines) if you can't stand the wait.  By the time I paid, the wait in line was at about 2.5 hours, so I can definitely see that being worth it.    The buffet itself is everything I wanted it to be.  I went to Wicked Spoon earlier in my trip, and wasn't very impressed.  Bacchanal had a much larger selection of items, and IMHO, they were prepared much better.    The BBQ pork was unusually delicious.  The tacos were made to order.  The selection of meats and seafood items was out of this world.  I was so full after several passes that I didn't even make it to the dessert island.  I did, however, see that they make fresh crepes, so hopefully I can control myself better next time I visit.    The service was great.  Our server was very prompt with drink service and attendant to all our our requests.  The patrons and dress code were about what you'd expect at a reasonably upscale Vegas buffet.    I read somewhere that Caesar's spent $17,000,000 to build this thing.  It shows.

I've been going to OTF for a few months now.  Love this workout!  You feel like you've accomplished a lot by the end of your hour.  And it's much more do-able than other workouts I've done, like Crossfit.  I'm kind of a cardio junkie, and this place is great for that.  Base. Push. All Out.  Repeat!

I have been curious about this place since it opened.  It's got a killer location right on 3rd and Roosevelt.  The restaurant has a nice industrial/distressed sort of design.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with the somewhat disjointed menu.  All of my lunch companions ordered Vietnamese dishes.  I ordered Sesame Chicken from the Chinese menu, and a California roll.  Boring, I know, but sort of my litmus test for these sorts of places.  All of my friends enjoyed the pho they got, as well as the spring rolls.  The peanut sauce was delicious.  My Sesame Chicken was among the best I've had in Phoenix, and there was nothing heinous about my California roll.  The food was good, the price was reasonable, the service was quick and friendly.  I'll be back for sure.

I've been driving by PHX Burrito House since it opened, and thought I'd finally stop in after a friend raved about it.  My friend was totally right.  I went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, so I got to talk with one of the owners a bit.  I learned that they own El Sol and El Zocalo in Chandler.  I'd been to both of those places before and really liked them.    I got a carne asada burrito.  The meat was prepared properly and had a good flavor to it.  The owner gave me a sample of some of the chips and salsa, which were very good.  My favorite part about the burrito though was the tortilla.  It had a perfect texture and thickness to it.  The owner told me they make them all right there at the restaurant.    They had a good selection of breakfast burrito offerings too.  So....I came back the next morning.  I had the bacon breakfast burrito and I can honestly say it's the best I've ever had.  The flavor was tremendous, and again, I just can't get over how good their tortillas are.  Great place.  Extremely friendly owners.  Fantastic torillas. Check it out.
