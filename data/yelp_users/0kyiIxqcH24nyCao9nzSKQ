Location: very unique up on small mountain side. Provides a very nice view. Decent amount of parking.   Service: very good. Very friendly hostess and waiter.   Food quality: rolls and salad tasted good. Nothing mind blowing but good. I ordered the rib eye. Not bad. Also not good. Imagine buying the lowest level grade steak from the store and cooking it without much thought. No crazy spices. Edible but not great. Came with vegetables that didn't look terribly healthy. I wasn't expecting fine dining but was hoping for more. Was there with 4 other people and the feeling towards the food was mutual among us.   Ambiance: it was ok. A bit loud but I was sort of expecting that after walking past the huge smelly bull out front :) I did take the slide which was funny.   Would I come back:  unlikely. I'm glad we tried it so I can say I've tried it but the food wasn't terribly enjoyable and it certainly wasn't cheap so there are much better options in that part of town.

I've been coming here for about 9 months now getting weekly shots. I feel it has helped me as my allergies have gotten much less severe. Also, the reduced allergies have led to zero asthma attacks which is nice. The staff is helpful and pleasant. They make you wait 30 after your shot in case you have a reaction. It's kind of a pain but I appreciate their concern and I just play on my iPad. I've introduced a few friends here and they seem to share my results. I'm to the point now that I don't have to take allergy meds as much. Before I was taking two nasal sprays and a pill daily.

Just purchased my third groupon for this place so that puts me on wash seven to indicate my experience level. I go to the Location on Ray. Car always comes out clean. They typically offer me an upgrade but not as pushy as most places which is nice. They hand scrub each car which is unique.

We used Chandler dogs for training services. Classes were small (2-3) dogs and very personal. The trainer Carlos (manager) is probably one of the most passionate person about dogs that I've ever met. I bought the training through Groupon so we got a great deal for 8 classes. Our little dog Zander did great and learned what we wanted him to learn. Some of the other dogs seemed to learn a little slower, but the trainer insisted that he would continue training the dogs for free until everyone was satisfied. I don't think I've ever seen this level if commitment from a company. I feel like I've learned just as much as my dog Zander. We are much closer now and I feel empowered to push him to continue learning. This facility also houses dogs as a service. I have not used this service yet, but from what I have seen over the last 8 weeks, it appears that it is well staffed and all animals are well cared for.

Food is great. I eat here a few times a week and never get sick of it. The juices are good too. Make sure you pick up a frequent diner card.

It's pretty simple why this place is the best.   Respect: they will remember your name and treat you like you are the reason you are in business.   Fun: always laughter and joking going on the whole time.   Quality/speed: absolute precision when it comes to haircuts and beard trims and they work as if you are late to your next appointment.

Very tasty. Ordered chicken yellow curry to-go. Food delivered promptly when I arrived. Heat levels range from 1-5. I got four. 4 usually destroys me at Thai places. Based on this 4 I think I will go 5 next time and really turn up the heat. Food had great flavor and seemed very fresh. Will come back.

Hi, I'm Alex. Thank you for reading my review. I'll keep it brief.   Parking spaces? Skinny.  Music? Yes, live.  Bar? Yes. Pony right up.  Pool table? Yep.  Waterfront view outside? Of course.  TVs? Yes.  Food quality? Good. Not insane. But good.  Service? Fast.    We brought a group of 20. The staff went out of their way to put tables together for us. Give this place a try.

Really good golf course. San Marcos was the first golf course built in Arizona, so it's a piece of AZ history. Recently, the course spent over $3m in renovations, and it shows. The greens are perfect, and the sand traps have brand new sand. On the downside, the new sand makes things quite painful =)  I've played the course about 6 times since the renovation, and I would say the average pace of play is not bad at all. We are typically done in just over 4 hours.   Now if I could just get back all the golf balls I've sent into the water, things would be perfect.  Thanks, Alex

This place really deserves one star, but the employees were so nice, I'm giving it two stars.   I live in an area that's quite populated, but situated between Chandler and Gilbert so sort of a dead zone when it comes to places to eat. With that being said, I was excited when Duke's opened.   I arrived around 6 PM and the bar was only about 20% full. I first sat in a booth for a while, but no server came over so I moved to a high top table since I saw a server addressing guests there. After another 5 minutes or so without being greeted, I moved to an open space at the bar hoping that things would move quicker. It took at least another 5 minutes before the bartender addressed me.   When I finally received my beer, the glass had the name printed on it from the prior establishment. So it would appear that everything that existed before has just been relabeled as Duke's (well not even relabeled I suppose...re owned?)  I asked the bartender for a recommendation on food and her lack of eagerness to direct me was probably my first clue that I should not be eating here. I ended up getting a quesadilla because that seemed like a safe option. Nope! What arrived was siting in a pool of very yellow grease. Not sure if it was butter...seemed like a cross between grease and butter. Eating it was similar to trying to hang onto a wet watermelon seed. I got through half and lost interest.   While I had time to sit and think while waiting for the bartender to get back to me (she was actually pretty nice, but I think there needed to be another bartender since she seemed pretty busy), I noticed that they did have wifi, but it was locked. Another small detail, I think the room could have used some sound absorbing material. Even though the place was only 20% full, the sound volume was quite loud.   There was some amusement though. The couple of my left was loudly arguing about divorce proceedings that one of them was going through or something to that nature. And on the other side a couple was arguing about men and women being allowed to play football together.   Also, at some point they opened the large windows that separated the inside seating from the outside. As soon as they did that the inside went from sort of warm, to really warm. It was only about 85 degrees outside, so I can't imagine how awful it will be once we hit triple digits.   The manager came by and asked how I liked the food. I mentioned the grease level. He took one look and totally agreed and offered to remove it from the bill. When I was delivered the bill later, he had forgotten to remove it so I had to call him over to have it taken care of. The manager was very nice.  With the level of competition now days, small places like this can't afford to be so-so. It would not surprise me if they went out of business in 6 months when they can't pay the rent. It's really a shame, if they put some thought into it they could have a great business.  Do yourself a favor, drive an extra 3 minutes over to Arizona Avenue and treat yourself to a decent establishment.

I would come here everyday if I could. Really delicious. Very friendly staff. Great concept. Not a whole lot to say about high quality shaved ice except to be careful since it's easy to become an addiction! Also the ring game on the patio will drive you mad if you give it long enough lol.   I hope to see more places like this pop up around town. It's great we are employing young people in a fun environment. Enjoy your sno! :)  I want to mention that I had a small issue in the past with getting the wrong flavor. I posted a review and the owner, Jeff, reached out to me about it immediately to resolve it. How refreshing to see someone take their clients' opinions that seriously. #fanforlife

To balance this other obviously bogus review that's posted: such a great restaurant. I've come here multiple times and have never had my cell phone stolen. I've had it in my pocket, in my hand, and on the table. My phone had never felt safer than when I'm here. Oh and the food is great too.

Espos is a taste of Mexico without the danger of Mexico ;) I've been eating here for a long time and really glad they have opened back up. I've pretty much eaten all the different items on the menu. I don't think they got their beer license back yet or I missed that on the menu. Don't let the look of the restaurant fool you. The food is better then fancy Mexican food places. The portions are really huge so it's easy to over order. I usually split something and add a cheese crisp or something with my fiance. The employees are always beyond friendly too. Restroom is out back in a separate building. Kind of weird but it looks clean so don't freak out.  Enjoy.
