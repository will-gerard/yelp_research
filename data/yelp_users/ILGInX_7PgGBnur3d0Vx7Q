Went on flamenco night, which was a nice touch.  Not so great for dinner conversation, though.  The food was OK, but the service was awful.  We literally waited an hour to get our check after asking our waitress for it.  Finally we ended walking to the front just so we could leave.  Because we used a discount, they automatically add a 20% gratuity before discount.  I might have given that much anyway, but after waiting so long for the check, it felt slightly exploitative.  So don't go on flamenco night if you're looking to catch up with a friend over dinner (it's impossible to hear over the music), and personally, I wouldn't go again on a discount.  Their automatic gratuity policy seems to give them carte blanche to ignore their guests.

Don't come here if you're looking for good service. Or really, any service at all.  On my first visit, we were seated for 20 minutes but never served, as we watched the single waitress hurriedly run around the place. Since we were somewhat hungry/thirsty, we left.  Last night was an improvement (at least we were served), but not by much. I had called a week in advance to avoid my first experience and was told they didn't accept reservations but they'd at least make a note to try to keep two tables ready for my party of 10.  No such tables were ready. No host greeted us, and when I explained the situation to the waiter who was also hurriedly running around, he responded: "Guess what? Tonight we're short-staffed, too."  Guess what? Maybe you should hire more people.   The abruptness continued. We were yelled at to get our IDs ready in advance if we wanted to drink, and when my friend didn't have hers out because she came late, the waiter was visibly annoyed. They didn't bring out my other friend's order with the rest of the dinners (to be fair, they comped her meal after she brought this to their attention). I never got a refill on my water or was asked if I wanted a second drink (also to be fair, their $5 martini is pretty decent). The pizza was greasy and unremarkable, and their fried onion strings were really fried batter strings, leaving the onion to the imagination.   Perhaps I happened to come on the worst, short-staffed nights. But I wouldn't risk making that mistake again.

I can't say enough good things about this place.   Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.  But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my "recent discovery" is "spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze." That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.  The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it. If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito.
