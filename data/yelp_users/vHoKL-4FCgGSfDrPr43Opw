Wow this place was pretty great. Came here for a work function so we had the back patio to ourselves which was amazing, because it overlooked a beautiful courtyard. We got to sample a lot of the appetizers and everything was so exquisitely prepared. Truly a delight.

My family and I have been coming here since I can remember. It is one of the only zoos that is not supported by the city, but instead through donors, ticket sales and members. So they really can do what they want to and with the zoo to make improvements, bring new animals in, etc. It is a large place with plenty of animals to see. I love the Arizona Trail; all the things that are right in your backyard are there! Well, kind of. I'm glad there's not a mountain lion in my backyard! But the animals are treated really well, and there's a wide range of them. You can ride camels, pet the sting rays, go on a safari ride, get up close and personal with a giraffe, etc. Prices for food are, of course, high, because they can charge and people will pay. But they don't bar you from bringing your own food and beverage in which is nice. And, the splash pads for the little ones are awesome when it is 100 degrees outside!

I have been coming to Runner's Den for years. My dad brought me here when I was 16 for my first pair of running shoes ever, and I keep going back.  The staff are so incredibly knowledgeable, probably because most of them log 30+ miles a week and have the experience to do their job well.  The wait can be a bit long, but that is because they pay so much attention to each customer. These guys genuinely like what they are doing and, in a world where I believe customer service is practically dead, outshine the rest of the running shoe stores around.   Another cool thing is that after buying a new pair of shoes there once, my hip started hurting and I thought it was because of the shoes, so I took them back and they fitted me for a different pair. They took back the other pair no problem. Turns out my hip pain wasn't because of the shoes (it was bursitis), but Runner's Den still took them back. So cool.

I am so grateful to Deal Chicken for featuring this place, otherwise I never would have come here. I visited here tonight with my husband and another couple. We had SO MUCH FUN!!!!  It may have been the wine, it may have been the euphoria of having real Italian food, I don't know, but the conversation was so wonderful, the ambiance was great, and the service was all I could have asked for. I have never had "authentic Italian food" (my only experience was the Olive Garden) and now I know what I was missing. The food was so delicate and quaint, yet full of flavor. I upgraded my penne pasta for the infamous gnocchi, and am so glad I did. The Chicken della Casa was wonderful and I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow! My friend had the lasagna, and it was nothing like any type of lasagna I've ever had in the past. There was more than enough food but I didn't walk out of there feeling weighed down, instead we enjoyed several courses over a period of 2 hours and I felt like I truly could have been in Italy.

I decided to come here for my birthday dinner, and made a great choice. It didn't start off great as they lost our reservation, but were able to still get us seated pretty quickly. Service was great, he was very attentive all night. And the food...oh my, melt in my mouth amazing. The pork tenderloin, corn cakes, risotto, steak, vegetables. Everything. We had such an amazing evening, I am so glad we came.

This is kinda messed up because I really don't like take-out Chinese food, but for some reason I was craving it...oh yeah, I saw a commercial for an eg groll and that sounded so good! So we ordered from Flamingo Palace based upon Yelp reviews, and I have finally found a Chinese takeout place I love! My problem is that the sauce is usually way too heavy and salty. However, my chicken and broccoli dish was perfect, and my husband's Flamingo Palace Special was superb. The meat was high quality. They even have brown rice! The spring rolls were decent; a bit too dough for me. I would have liked more filling. Same with the egg rolls. But still...my fave Chinese takeout by far.

I think I want to eat here every day this week. I came in on a slow Sunday night, and wanted to go back on Monday (but I finished my leftovers instead), then Tuesday, and I actually think I might go back tonight to try the Green Chili Chicken Enchilada. I got the Chicken Fajitas plate, and my husband got the tamale and taco combo.  Everything was fresh, not too greasy, and extremely delicious. This is my new quick and easy Mexican food restaurant. Yay!

I LOVE WETZEL'S PRETZELS.  My husband and I will come to the mall specifically for Wetzel's and nothing else. We'll make up an excuse to go to the mall and then be all like, oh yeah, and let's get a pretzel while we are there. We always get the bitz and they are so soft and fluffy. Lately the ones on the bottom don't seem to get as much butter love as the ones on top, but that's what I save the pizza sauce for.

I love shopping here! For the most part, the produce is wonderful and fresh. My only complaint in that area is the berries...sometimes they can be a bit moldy, but the last few times a fresh batch of strawberries or blueberries has been brought in, they've been wonderful. We love buying our meat here, especially the chicken sausages and tenders (when they are on sale). We also get our lunch meat here as it is much better than the stuff in a container, and cheaper than the stuff at the deli counter at a regular store. Oh, and the bulk section is amazing!

When I crave Mexican food but don't want something smothered in cheese and grease, I come to La Parilla Suiza.  I have been here several times, and everything I have had has been great. Most recently, I had a cup of the chicken and rice soup, and a fajita taco a la carte. My husband has the bistec (sp?) tacos. He really liked them.  This place is not too filling and yet you feel very satisfied. Its pretty cool too because you get to watch the guys making everything through one of those glass windows.

My husband and I love coming here for happy hour. They have great appetizer and drink specials. Their ballpark pretzels are so big and soft and the dip is delish. Last night we also got the buttermilk chicken tenders which were good and not too bready or greasy.  The pork street tacos were also great. We had a very filling dinner by just eating off the HH appetizer menu! We also have a mug club card, which is free to sign up for, and when you show it you get upgraded to a 22 oz beer at no extra charge. You also get other free stuff as you accumulate visits.  Last time we got a free pint glass. Their HH is from 4-7 Mon-Sat, so even if you come at dinnertime you can still get the HH special pricing, which I highly recommend.

This was just so not worth it. The pizza was tasteless, overpriced and burnt. So I guess if it had any taste it would be burnt crust taste. We had the margherita and pepperoni pizza, and they skimped on the sauce for both so that there was way too much end crust that tasted...burnt. Very disappointed.

I could take their green curry sauce and eat it with just the brown rice and be a very happy camper. I might even be able to just eat it with a spoon and be perfectly content. Have gotten it twice and can't imagine getting anything else there. I also really enjoy the tea they serve...its green tea with brown rice infused, or something like that. So its a little nutty tasting, and very good! I tried the lemon pepper chicken once and didn't like it; it was very dry. Don't know if there was supposed to be sauce or something, but either way it was very tasteless. The dan dan noodles are good, too.

I decided to go out with some friends here for my 30th birthday and I am so glad we did! It was my husband and 2 other couples, and we sat in a nice, private booth and had the BEST time. We had 2 LivingSocials and got quite a deal. That's always a plus! The server was terrific and really added to our enjoyment. I like how they don't rush you out of there and really expect you to stay all evening. And we did - for over 3 hours!!! We got to try two cheeses, broths, and desserts since there were 6 of us so that was awesome. I had a really great time!

These are the best bagels I have ever had in my life.  I have not been here personally, but a co-worker lives nearby and brings them in on Friday mornings. They are so fluffy and fat. I would like to go there myself to try other items on the meny. But as far as being a bagel shop, these guys got it right.

It is really, really hard not to get totally stuffed when you go to Oregano's. Tonight was my first time trying their stuffed Number One-o, and I'm glad I waited a little bit before trying to have a second slice. Because having a second slice definitely would not have been a good idea. Delicious as it was, and ooey gooey with cheese, it was VERY filling. But did I have room for dessert? Of course I did! And since 8 of us shared 2 pizzookie's (only, really only like 5 of us had some....and of those 5 only 2 had more than one bite (I was one of the two)), I felt totally okay with it. But alas, I left satisfied and very, very happy.

I have physically been in this location to order a meal, and my company uses them regularly to cater 200 chicken or steak teriyaki bowls. They always do a great job. The food is always fresh, hot and delicious. No complaints about Samurai Sam's or their delicious eggrolls.

I have been a patient of Dr. Dairiki ever since I became pregnant with my first child in 2012. I saw her all throughout my first pregnancy, and my second. She delivered both my boys. I like how she is a solo practitioner, because I always know who I am going to see. It is either her or Patricia Hastings, who is fabulous. You get all the blood work and ultrasounds done right in the office, and don't have to go to another location, which is very convenient. I got to know all the office staff. I was able to remain active during my pregnancies, which Dr. Dairiki encouraged. I delivered in the middle of the night, at 2:05 am, and Dr. Dairiki was there for me. I really enjoy DMOBGYN.

My coworkers and I always have a great time here. We just went out yesterday for lunch and the service was very good. I had a grilled chicken salad, which was okay. My coworkers all loved their food, which all looked much better than my salad! The guy next to me got the Southwest burger and he said he's gotten that before, as well as the fish and chips and beer battered chicken strips, and everything has been wonderful. The fries were thick-cut and looked amazing. I normally get the peach ale when I go but since it was lunchtime, I held off. BUT, I definitely plan on trying the Stoutamisu next time I go! That's right...stout in a tiramisu. Genious!!  Something funny...my husband just told me that my work needs to plan a happy hour there soon so that he can go! Like we can't just go on our own?!?! Ha!

So, like, this was freakin' fantastic. We came here for a friend's birthday on a weeknight, and I don't know if it was because it was slower or the server was just this good, but he gave some of the best service I've ever had.  The food was so.delicious.  We had appetizers, a main course and the adorable little dessert shooters that are absolutely perfect for the person who doesn't want a full dessert, but still wants a little somethin' somethin'.  Love, love, love.

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hotel. After reading the negative reviews, I was a bit skeptic, but everything was really nice. The front staff was wonderful. The manager's reception was pleasant. Great breakfast, clean rooms, etc. I was a little annoyed I had to pay for WiFi, but fortunately I was traveling for work. The only downside here is the area of town it is in. I walked to the convenience store down the block and that was a mistake. Creepy, creepy.

I have been going to this gym for over 2 years and have very little to complain about.  I like that it is never too crowded...who wants to wait for a cardio machine or bench? I feel very comfortable in the free weights section, and feel good about doing my own thing and not feeling the need to "impress" anyone. And I love, love, love Melanie's turbokick class on Saturday mornings! I used to like to sleep in on Saturdays, but not since discovering this class! When I during the weekday mornings, the guy working there is always very friendly and upbeat. Some of the girls at the front counter are a little dense, but as long as I can get a good workout in, who cares? Plus, this location is WAY BETTER than the Scottsdale Rd. and T-bird location, even though that is a Sport and this is an Active. I would rather go to this location any day of the week.

I'm so torn as I write this review.  The atmosphere and service is unparalleled. The sweetest, cutest servers with really excellent attitudes make me want to come back, and the '50s style motif is very cool. The manager came over to see how we were doing and he was very interested to know if we were happy with everything. But...I wasn't totally satisfied. The ice cream was great - nice and creamy and real.  We split the pippen Jolly Green Giant and when it came out we were a bit underwhelmed. They made it seem to grandiose, and it was just...eh. Regular mint choco chip ice cream with some mini choco chips sprinkled on top. My mom had the Cafe Ole and loved it. My papa had a sundae with caramel sauce and loved it. It did seem a bit overpriced, but the experience was worth it.

For all the people that had a bad experience, I am shocked. We came in on a Friday afternoon, so didn't have the full selection to pick from. But, everything we did choose was wonderful. The eclair was delicious and the frosting for the German Chocolate cupcake was to die for. The owner was very proud of her shop and should be; she made delicious desserts and was very competitively priced! Forget all the chain and grocery store desserts, this is the place to come for anything!

Right from the first few seconds I opened the door to Romanelli's, I felt like I was in a fairy dreamland.  I was immediately greeted by a beautiful display case of Italian cookies, which we (my husband and I) later went back and bought a pound of.  Then we followed our noses to the deli counter, where they had both hot food already prepared, as well as a menu of deli sandwiches. We decided to shop around a little bit first, since I wanted to buy a few items. We took our time wandering around the store, and after about 10 minutes on of the owners, Robert, came over to us to make sure we were okay. He then proceeded to take us around the store pointing out all the best ingredients and what I was looking for.  It was a delight! I stocked up on the basics like EVOO, balsamic vinegar, pasta, and bought my first can of San Marzanos. It was after the canned tomato aisle that my heart stopped. I literally turned around and almost peed my pants. I almost pee my pants just thinking about it. I spotted the pastry case, and contained within was a HUGE eclair that made my heart do a little flutter. So of course I HAD to get an eclair....and a cannoli and baklava. This was my first cannoli and will most definitely not be my last. YUM!!!!!!!  We then went back to the deli counter and ordered lunch. I had the Italian Stallion and my husband had the sausage and pepper sub. He was so impressed, that we ordered 2 links of sausage to take home with us!   Overall, this being my first time in an Italian deli and grocery, it was more of an experience than anything. The people were so friendly and helpful to the blonde girl from Phoenix. I clearly didn't know what I was doing but they have so much passion for their food and what they do, that they took the time to help educate me on Italian cooking and all the pleasure it brings. Even though it takes about 20 minutes to get here from my house, I will definitely be going back.

I do like tasty burgers. I normally get chicken sandwiches at fast food restaurants, but the place has "burgers" in the menu, so I thought "why not?". I'm glad I went with my gut here. I simply had the single burger but it was definitely enough to fill me up! My 15 mo son had yet to eat a hamburger before today, and he ate his whole slider! My husband had the Cowboy burger and it was huge and delicious. Prices are extremely reasonable for what you get. The atmosphere was fun, too. Only 4 stars because we got a drink and filled the cup with Sobe, and it tasted waaaay watered down.

Don't come here before 10 pm on a Friday night unless you want to listen to old ladies singing oldies songs. We were a fun group that stopped in at 8:30ish to listen to some karaoke, and it was a disaster. A bunch of blue hairs reliving their glory days and terrorizing the ears of everyone in the restaurant. I'll come back here when I'm 60. The service was also pretty bad, I remember looking back to find out server and just saw her sitting at the bar top doing nothing. On a Friday night in a bar? Really lady?

I was really happy with this place! Game here for a girl's weekend and we stayed in the nice 2 bedroom suites. We got room service one morning and it was delicious (custom made omelets). The rooms were clean and updated. Comfortable beds. The pool by us was great, and I like how they have 5 pools around the property since the main pool can get a little busy. It seems like you have a different expereince depending on which rooms you book.

Maybe if I visited the lounge and enjoyed a cocktail while listening to jazz I would have liked it here. As far as the service, it was great. Gigi was awesome, very nice and attentive. The food was terrible. I had the mesquite grilled chicken with farfalle pasta and the sundried tomatoes were the best part of the dish. Way too much sauce and nothing special. My husband got the chicken piccata and it was awful. The sauce had absolutely no flavor, apparently they don't season anything and it tasted like it was out of a can. It came in a plastic dome cover like it was hospital food. Kind of tasted like it, too. The roasted vegetables were decent but the garlic mashed potatoes were nothing special. The decor was seriously lacking. Not impressed and I won't be back.

This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. A huge group of girls came here for a bachelorette party, and we were treated so poorly it was disgusting. The place was dirty, outdated, and just not fun. If you are not a regular, you are basically worthless there. Our server was just fine, but when we wanted a pitcher of water, the manager had to step in cut us off. Really? No more water? Geez. We waited an hour to sing our first song because the DJ kept putting the regulars in front of us. There is no book for you to sift through, you just pick one at random.   I would have thought they'd have wanted our business; we could have bought a lot of drinks and had a good time but they were too busy protecting their regulars and giving crappy service to us.

What an incredible evening! A bachelorette party of 10 ladies came here on Saturday night and it was fantastic. The service was very attentive, the pace was just right, and the food was delicious. We all got the 4 course meal and shared 4 bottles of wine. The experience lasted 3.5 hours and was absolutely mah-velous!

My family and I went here for my birthday last night. Last year we went to Pomo Pizzeria and I wanted to go to another gourmet pizzeria. One bite into my Rustica pizza and I nearly died. The crust...so thin and soft! The cheese...so meltyl! The proscuitto....so salty and perfect!! 6 of us split 2 pesto salads (delicious), and 3 pizzas: the Rustica, Salsiccia and Margherita. The Rustica was my favorite, followed by the Margherita then Salsiccia. The cheese was just so....authentic. The service was delightful. When we arrived, I told them we had 6 people, and I am obviously very pregnant, so the owner was incredibly polite in making sure I was comfortable with where we were sitting and I was cool enough and everything. My only disappointment was that I didn't get any acknowledgement that it was my birthday, but oh well. That's the worst of it. Overall, it was delightful...and I'm looking forward to having a leftover slice of pie right now!!

I always leave YC's feeling full and wonderful. I love how they encourage you to stuff your bowl full of food by supplying tissues to pack it down. The staff is so friendly and always offer to make your sauces. I suggest getting the large bowl them getting a to-go container. They also have soup you can fill up on so the to-go container is totally worth it. Now I don't need to eat for the rest of the day.

My mom and I came here for a nice little ladies night out and it was very enjoyable. We sat on the patio which was beautiful! It was hot outside, but there were misters and the trees provided great shade and added a bit of coolness. The pesto and focaccia was delicious. We tried the bruschetta trio...the goat cheese and asparagus, manchego and another one. All were good. The funghi flatbread was good, and the beet salad was great! Overall the atmosphere was very nice.

Always a good time at the Dubliner. We used to come here almost every Saturday night and while it is difficult to get a sitting or standing table, there is a lot of room to stand around, hehe. We usually end up playing darts or something. The staff is always polite and you can tell they like working there. That's always good. The beef stew is awesome. Bring on the fried pickles! The round ones are better, but they started doing spears, so hope that changes. Overall such a fun place!

Man, the quality of Outback has really gone down since the last time I came here. I hope it was just an off night, but everything seemed to go wrong.  The menu was wrong on several occasions. My husband ordered the Sam Adams on draft. Says it should be a Boston Lager, but the Summer Ale came out. Apparently they were out of Boston Lager on tap but the server didn't tell us and didn't offer anything else. The chicken artichoke flatbread was delicious, but the menu says a "sprinkling of parmesan cheese". The thing was heavily covered in it. I would have asked for light cheese if I'd known it was more like a cheese crisp. I ordered the steak salad medium, it came out medium rare. Also, it didn't say that gorgonzola cheese crumbles came on it, otherwise I would have asked for those to be left off. So unfortunately I had to send it back. The manager was very polite and took the flatbread off our bill, but when he tried to explain that they were out of the Boston Lager beer and that's why we got the Summer Ale, I was a little annoyed. Okay that's fine, it would have just been nice to know that in the beginning. Don't give me excuses. All in all it was a very mediocre service and just not as good as I remember.

This place has grown to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the valley. It is close to my house, the prices are good, service is always friendly, and the food is tasty. My favorite is their fajita salad. I know, a salad at a Mexican restaurant. But I just love them! I always eat my husbands side of rice and beans on his plate, and stuff myself on the chips beforehand, but I'm not the only one, right? Anyway, they've been around a long time, so Valle Luna is tried and true. Try it out.

I have been here a few times and never been disappointed.  Most recently I came with a co-worker for Happy Hour and was over the moon with my food and the price! The flatbread is huge and delicious.  I want to try the sliders next time. Keep in mind HH is 3-6, and I highly recommend it!!!

I am not a huge fan of spending $3.50 on a cupcake, but at this place I didn't have to, and the cupcakes were better than those other places where you do have to spend $3.50 a cupcake!   My husband and I came in here on Saturday afternoon after watching them win on Cupcake Wars. We ordered the lemon, carrot cake, brown velvet and orange marmalade with rosewater frosting. We then took them to my in-laws for dessert that evening and quartered each cupcake so we all got to try a bite. My favorite was the orange marmalade one. Too bad it won't be on the menu for too long. My second fave was the lemon, then brown velvet then carrot cake. The carrot cake was a little too heavy in my opinion. But I don't even know if its possible to make a light and fluffy carrot cake cupcake.   I love supporting small, local businesses, and this is definitely one you will want to support! Congratulations on your win, Urban Cookies!!

Wow I have so much fun going here! It reminds me of Wegman's on the east coast. I love the fresh foods section and meals to go. I am also impressed with their healthy food selection. I needed coconut milk yogurt and Fry's has it for cheaper than anywhere else I can buy it from. Win! They have a frozen yogurt spot that I want to try too.  Like, the swirly kind out of a machine. Also, a co-worker once bought my birthday cake from here and I loved it so much and haaad to know where he got it from - I thought it was a professional bakery!

Sunflower Market is terribly overpriced and not very good. Why am I paying $1 more for a pound of apples that I could get at Sprouts? They are the exact same apples.  That's the case with everything here. I much prefer Sprouts or Trader Joe's.

I love, love, love TJ's. I could walk in here in a bad mood and come out in a good mood. Its funny though, they are either really well priced or really expensive. Their produce and fresh fruit is expensive but their bagged veggies are a great price. Their cheese selection is awesome and way cheaper than Whole Foods. My only dislike are the people who shop here. It is probably the location but there is a lot of snobbery and pretentiousness. As long as I keep to myself though, I can handle it.

One of my favorite dishes in pho. Chicken pho. And the chicken pho here is unbelievable.  The broth is so flavorful and savory; I could eat it all by itself without the noodles or anything.  But, the noodles are delicious too so I am glad that they are in the stock.  I don't even add any sriracha or hoisen sauce or anything because the soup is perfect as it is. And I love that this place is in a little strip mall and owned by a local family.

My husband and I enjoy going to Costco just to walk around. There have been many Saturday afternoons where we were bored and just decided to go to Costco to see what samples they have, and to get a Polish dog and churro. Oh yeah, and we usually end up buying something too. The only think I don't like is the smug lady "greeter"  who in her rude way asks to see your card, even if we obviously are in the process of getting it out of our wallets. Geez, take a chill pill.

My husband just got home from Chicago and wanted to go here for Father's Day. We have driven by it countless times but it has never been open. Turns out it is only open from 3:30-9 Thursday through Monday. So we came, and we came for the pizza. Because that is all they have on the menu (no wings, garlic bread, mozzarella sticks, nothing). Pizza is what they do best, and it is all they do. And they do it well. The cheese was so delicious and tasted high quality. We had the standard crust (thin) on one Hawaiian pizza (loved!!!) and the medium thick crust on the Johnnie's Deluxe (also loved!!). Sausage was awesome. The decor was completely lacking, but like I said...you come here for the pizza, not to be wined and dined.

I feel like a cheap whore giving a place like Barro's Pizza five stars. Shouldn't those be reserved for such esteemed places like Cibo or Pizzeria Bianco? Eh, whatev.  The pizza here is delicious, they are way inexpensive, and you get very full, very quickly. The interior of this location is kinda dingy, but clean, so I don't mind sitting on the same booth that has been there since 1986 (or whenever the place opened).  The pizza is what I'm looking for when I want a good, hearty, slice of pie.  Try the Kona, you won't be sorry.

I didn't actually go to Nick's, he instead came to me. I used Nick's for a company catering event today, and ordered 3 things: the meat lasagna, the chicken risotto, and the pasta bolognese. All 3 of them were delicious. The meat lasagna went so fast, we ran out of that before we even got into the second pan of risotto or pasta bolognese! It was meaty and hearty and everything a lasagna should be. We also got the spinach salad that was supposed to have cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon on it, but someone in the kitchen was a bit stingy with the cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon. They also brought sliced french bread that I used to sop up my meat sauce and it was the epitome of comfort food. Overall I really enjoyed the food, and would definitely go there on my own.

Fresh salad, hot soups, cold ice cream...who can't be happy with all this? Plus, so much more. My husband and I come to Sweet Tomatoes but only after I've had a good workout, because I know I will want to try everything at this "healthy" buffet. Sure, you can eat healthy here, but you can also eat unhealthy and definitely overeat. I love their soups and everything is so fresh. And for a buffet, its a good price. Especially if you can get a coupon out of your local newspaper.

9 co-workers and myself came here today for lunch. It was my birthday and I decided to try someplace new.  It was very quiet inside which was nice because we had a large party, but I don't know where all the people were! The food was really delicious. We split 3 pizzas: the Nico Antonio, Whitestone Bridge, and Aunt Marguerite. The cheese was awesome. The crust was soft but crispy in the right places. And, because it was my birthday they gave me a free cannoli with a candle in it and a fake rose with a "Happy Birthday" sign. What a nice touch! I am excited to come back and try an individual meal and perhaps one of the appetizers.

Um, yeah okay, Auntie Anne's will do. Wetzel's is my favorite, but Anne's is a close second. The first time I had them I hated them, I think it was because I got the pretzel stix and they were too hard. But the last couple of times I have gotten the regular unsalted pretzel and it was good. BUT. One time I got the almond pretzel and had to return it because it tasted burnt. At least they exchanged it. So I guess Anne's is hit or miss but I'm still gonna give em 4 stars because I love pretzels THAT MUCH.

I have been to the original The Place many times in Flagstaff when I lived there, but yesterday was the first time I have been to this location. And man, did it bring me back to the good old times! Same great recipes, same great prices. The pancakes are huge and fluffy. The biscuits are soft and buttery. I got the 2 eggs entrée, and it was perfect. I substituted the multigrain pancakes and they were nice and nutty. My husband got the polish sausage bowl, and I had a bite and could have had many, many more. We had a party of 6 (plus 2 kids), and the service was fast and efficient and polite. The restaurant is also really cool inside with the chandeliers  and wood paneling - it reminded me of a lodge. I felt like I should be in the mountains (you know, the kind with pine trees), and not the desert. I wish it wasn't so far from my house otherwise this would be my new favorite breakfast place! After all, it is "The Place"!

A few friends, my husband and I met up here on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. Arrived before happy hour ended, so enjoyed some guac and chips and a Dos Equis before the real meal. I had a fajita salad with chicken. The lettuce and veggies were fresh and the mango-pineapple vinaigrette was great! My husband had 2 Tinga tacos and they seemed a bit small; you'd think 2 tacos would be enough to fill you up but he was still hungry after finishing them. We stayed for almost an hour and a half just enjoying each other's company and the service was good the whole time.

I have driven past here countless times and have seen the little, unassuming "Gyros" sign. I did not expect to be so delighted when I finally decided to try it out! It seems kind of shabby on the outside, but the food - man oh man! I had the hummus and chicken, and the chicken was so incredibly flavorful I was blown away. My husband had the gyro meal with well done fries. Get the fries well done. I had a bite of his gyro and it was the most flavorful gyro meat I have ever had. I like the style too, where you go up to the counter and order. We will definitely go back!

Stunning views. My husband and I came here to participate in a running race. He ran the 50k which went up Pass Mountain, and I ran the 12k which ran around some of the trails. They were very well maintained and the desert was just gorgeous. The facilities were nice and maintained. It also appears as though they have guided hikes on the weekends which would be fun.

I am so impressed with the patience and kindness of the workers at Chick-fil-A. They are always so nice and proactive with getting you what you need. It is a parent's dream - the play place is awesome and I can get a Diet Lemonade and sit in the booth and watch my 3 year old play. The salads are fresh and delicious. The kids meals are great and I really appreciate the toy which is always educational and interactive.

This is my husband's and my favorite place to come for breakfast.  I have never eaten lunch or dinner here, so can only vouch for breakfast. And it is awesome! This last time I got the Torrey Pines omelet and oat bialy...the omelet was melt in your mouth good. My husband got the banana nut pancakes which were twice as big as his face for one. He usually gets the bobka crumb french toast, which I would classify more as dessert it is so sweet, but so delicious! I have never  been disappointed with anything I have gotten. The dessert case is incredible looking but I have never gotten anything from it...one day I will though!!

Tonight was my third visit to il Posto and I have not been disappointed.  All the food I have gotten has been very good. Tonight I had the apple-arugula salad topped with chicken. I have had their gnocchi, eggplant rollatini, pasta with sausage, etc. and all has been good. Sitting inside is a very different experience than sitting outside; tonight there was no outside seating so we were forced indoors and the experience was not as good. I highly suggest outdoors if possible. The servers are usually young kids who don't have much experience, so don't expect a lot in that department. But the food is great, as is the ambiance.

This is a great place to spend a hot Saturday morning, and if your kiddo doesn't need a nap, you could spend all day here! There is so much to do, its impossible to do everything in one trip. Especially if your kid likes to climb things, good luck getting out of the climbing apparatus thing at the very beginning, haha! There really is something for everyone, from physical activities to arts and crafts, food shopping, riding bikes, rolling balls down chutes, and so much more!

I bought a Groupon after seeing that Les Miserables was playing hwre, and I am so glad I did! I would never have come otherwise, but it was such a nice treat to see a spectacular play (I am shocked at how talented the actors are!), and have dinner all in one place. Dinner itself was fine; I had the French onion soup and a salad. The service was pretty slow, I think I saw our server once and we had to refill our own waters several times. We had chocolate cake for dessert which is not on the menu but should have been, because it was really good. The lobby area seems a little dated with the decor, but fortunately that's not where we spent most of our time. So the next time I want to see a show, I  will definitely think of Arizona Broadway Theatre!

Best.Bruschetta.Ever.  I came here with some co-workers for lunch and found quite a gem! I would have never found it on my own as it was tucked away, but thanks to Yelp I found it! Apparently one of my co-workers had been coming here for years but had kept the secret all to himself. The Mediterranean salad with chicken was very good, and the bruschetta was to die for! I liked the chewy bread instead of crusty, crispy kind.  The pizza bread was decent but could have been a bit saucier.  The decor is adorable. I am always so happy to find small places like this!

I ate here 2 hours ago and am still stuffed. The guy working said they aim to make you waddle out, not wall, and they succeeded. Oh my gosh it was all so good. I had the chicken platter and subbed hummus for the rice. The hummus was very thick, different from what I am used to. The chicken was a tad dry, but good when mixed with the tzatziki sauce, which they make in-house. My husband said the original gyro was the best he's ever had. And I am not normally a french fry girl, but couldn't stop eating them off his plate. I was curious about the meatballs, and the guy behind the counter brought out a sample for me and the hubs to try. Delicious it was, as well as the sauce on top. Great service, too. Nothing fancy inside, but overall great food.

This is one of my favorite Mexican "fast food" joints ever.  My company caters from them quite often, and whenever we order from there, people love us!!! We get the chicken fajita , carne asada and carnitas burritos. The meat is so flavorful and delicious.  They always do such a fantastic job. Very hard workers. It is owned by Arturo and his sister, Maria. Say hi to them next time you stop in.

I have wanted to go here for a while and am so glad I finally made it here. The food was so fresh and delicious and I felt great just eating it. I had half a harvest salad and half a kale salad with chicken. Also a glass of delicious Parducci. My husband had the chicken sausage pizza and it was delicious. The crudites were popular according to what other people had on their tables, so can only imagine that was good. I am a fan!

I always make the mistake of bringing only one bag in with me, and then I end up buying 3 bags worth of groceries!! I could just walk up and down the aisles, filling my cart with every other thing I see. They have so many unique products. Cookie butter, anyone? The prices are terrific, although the meat is a little pricey. But everything else is priced great! I saw this documentary called "Dive" about TJ's, and I hope it isn't true, or at least this location doesn't do what the documentary portrays. I'll leave it at that.

Indulge Burgers got a few things right and a few things wrong, but overall, I was very pleased with my experience. We had a Living Social deal, and got the sweet potato and regular fries combo, as well as a side salad to start. The fries were good, but nothing special. The salad made me want to cry. I know you don't go to a burger joint to get a salad, but couldn't you at least try to make it a decent salad? It was all white lettuce and a few sprigs of sliced carrots. My husband wanted me to give the place 3 stars for the lettuce alone. But, the burgers themselves were good, and the Build-Your-Own was a really good deal. There is good variety on the toppings, cheese, sauces and buns to choose from. My turkey patty was huge - it was overflowing out of the English muffin.   Some plusses: the service was really, really excellent. One of the best servers I've ever had. Also, while we were waiting for our table, the owner/manager came around and offered everyone samples of margarita. Since I'm pregnant and couldn't try the sample, he said I got a free milkshake. After we were seated and he was walking around, he made sure our server knew that he had offered a free milkshake and made good on the promise! That was so cool. I left totally stuffed and very satisfied.

I am a self professed Sam Fox groupie. Every restaurant I have been to by him, I have loved. Blanco did not disappoint. I came with a group of 7 girls on Saturday night, and while they told us 35 to 40 min wait, it was only about 15. Score! We shared 2 bowls of guacamole which was delish. The chips were addictive, I told myself I wouldn't have any but these were better than any I had ever had. I had the roasted chicken, green Chile pork, and shredded tacos combo. Roasted chicken was my favorite. The rice packed a lot of flavor, and the beans were so-so. I enjoyed the Paloma cocktail. Yes the tacos were small, but the rice and beans were generous and I left feeling quite full. Sam Fox has yet to disappoint!

I really enjoyed everything we had here. We started with the pretzels, which were huge and soft and stayed soft throughout the meal. The dips were both good. The chopped salad was awesome and I almost ate the whole thing myself, leaving little for my husband. The Schreiner's pizza was good, although I am not sure if it was any better than  a regular sausage pizza. The service was really great, too. We will definitely be back!

Mouth. Watering. That is what happens every time I come to PJ. I love everything on the menu. Well, everything I've had, anyway, Which is a lot. Let's see...the chicken shawarma, beef gyro, hummus and grilled chicken, lavosh pizza, dolmades, chicken pasta salad, pesto lavosh turkey wrap...yeah. Its all good. I could eat a bucket of their hummus every day. My company caters from them a lot and it is everyone's favorite place that we order from. If I could burrow myself into a beef gyro and sleep there, I probably would.

I had seen this very unassuming place before in the Scottsdale Airpark and had always been curious about it, so when a co-worker suggested we go here, I jumped on it.  I am in love with this place. It is owned by a couple who transplanted to AZ several years ago, and they opened this place in 2007. The paninis are absolutely magnifique, and the croissants are tender and delicate and baked fresh every morning. I was so impressed with them, that I suggested my work use them for a catering event a couple weeks later. They did a fantastic job...everyone who attended the event wanted to know where the food was from and where they could go to get it.   I really hope to see this place succeed as it is pretty much run by the couple only (he cooks and she takes the orders and serves the food). Don't let the location detract you from visiting here!

I had the absolute pleasure of attending Saturday yoga at Singh Farms last week. The space was so lovely and peaceful, it was an absolute oasis. The yoga class was so peaceful and serene. The market was filled with people enjoying the outdoors, beautiful plants and flowers and general atmosphere. It is too bad that the market will be closing; I truly hope that the community doesn't let that happen. I would love to go back.

I love always being greeted with a "hi" whenever I walk in. The young men and women who work here are incredibly polite. The drink possibilities are vast, although I usually get the green tea. Sometimes I treat myself to a delicious cappuccino. And I must say, it has some of the best doughnuts in town, and they are only 59 cents after 3 pm!

This was incredibly disappointing.  I drive by this place almost every day on my way home from physical therapy, so when it was featured on Doozy of a Deal, I jumped at the chance to buy a coupon.   My husband and I came here after hiking in the McDowell Mountain preserve. I had the Mediterranean omelet with a pancake and he had the malted waffle with a side of home fries. My omelet was good, but the cooks foiled my attempt to make it healthy by cooking it in oil. I literally picked up the omelet and put it on a napkin, and the napkin soaked up its oil. Gross. My pancake was very dense and kind of dry. Not light and fluffy like pancakes should be.   My husband's waffle was pretty pathetic. Also dense and flavorless. Here's the scary part: the server dropped off the syrup and it was all frothy...we tasted it and we think it was fermenting. If they use real maple syrup and don't refrigerate it, then it will ferment. We had our server bring us another bottle and that one was better.   Overall we will not be returning. We would both rather go to iHop than Over Easy.

This is the only place I ever come to get my car washed. You can't beat $2.99 for a free vacuum (you do it yourself, which I prefer since I can take my time and make sure everything gets sucked out) and a wash.  My car is never super dirty when I bring it in, only the typical dust that accumulates in the desert. But, it always comes out clean. You have to pay $4.99 to get a damp towel at the beginning and a scrub down, so sometimes I pay extra for that. I don't know why people would be unhappy here. You get what you pay for.

So I come here for 3 things: the splash pad, Menchie's, and H&M. Oh, and I have been to the Apple Store also, so I guess 4 things. The splash pad is awesome for the kiddos because it is nice and shaded by huge palm trees. There is a nice blend of retail clothing shops, jewelry stores, restaurants, and specialty stores to keep most people happy. A few other fun places are Make Meaning and iPic if you really want something special. Nice misters make the hot summer days a bit cooler. It is like a street taken out of Beverly Hills and transplanted into the middle of Scottsdale.

Stacy is ah-mazing. She has the most positive energy and you truly feel the difference when you go to New Serenity Spa vs. other places. She is a one-woman show, and takes incredible care of each and every customer. You feel so special when you go in there, and are not just another number. I have gone to other places where they usher you in and out, and the results are just not as good. Stacy gets to know you personally.. I highly recommend New Serenity Spa.

I have always been very pleased with the service I receive here. It is not a cookie cutter factory like Massage Envy, and the treatments are way better than the ones I have received there! Admittedly, I have only had the massage, and the only therapist I have used is Michael. He is one of the BEST therapists I have ever been to. I bought a monthly membership and every time I book with him. But, I love the fact that DSS offers facials, teeth whitening treatments, tanning, body treatments, etc. I can get basically anything I want for only $39! It is such a great deal. The website is very convenient and easy to use when booking, but my only complaint is that if you have to cancel or change your appointment, you have to call to let someone know. I wish I could cancel or change online. Other that than, I highly recommend DSS!

Do not purchase a membership here. I am cancelling mine out of frustration with never being able to book appointments. They always have so many Deal Chickens/Groupons/Living Socials, etc. that it is nearly impossible to find an opening, plus the membership actually is more expensive than simply purchasing the online deal. The massages and facial I get are usually not bad, it just depends on who you get. But I pay $39 monthly for one service when I can pay $69 for a Deal Chicken and get 2 services! I am getting screwed by being a member. Next time I want to come here I will simply purchase a deal online.

Paradise Tile was the first and only place I called when I needed to get new flooring for my home. We were moving into a new house and needed new carpet. I called Cosimo and he gave me great personalized attention. We went to the store to pick out carpet we might want. He met me at my soon to be home, measured, and brought the carpet samples with him that we had selected. He gave us a quote right then and there. I wanted the job to get done immediately upon us receiving the keys to the new house, and he made it happen. It was a large job, but he has a great installer and we are very happy with the result. Thanks Cosimo!

What a wonderful Italian pizzeria! My friends and I went here for my birthday and had a great time drinking wine and eating pizza. The pizza was absolutely delicious. My husband and I also split a wonderfully fresh and delightful salad. I had leftovers and confirmed that the pizza was just as good the next day, even though I wasn't tipsy anymore :)  My only complaint is that I felt very rushed by the server. We were taking our time chatting and enjoying ourselves, and the server kept coming by like, every 2 minutes to see if we were ready to order. Did we look ready? No. I quickly had to scan the meny and we told him that we wanted salads as appetizers first, but he still made us put in the entire order "because that's how the chefs like it". In fact, if I were focused more on the service I would only give Pomo 3 stars, but I won't cause I liked the pizza so much.

Warning: you must have patience in order to come here. But, your patience will be rewarded.  The yogurt selection is among the best; very unique and delicious flavors.  I also LOVE how they have "Flavortinis", in which they give you suggestions for yogurt and topping pairings. The part you need patience with is the set-up of the store. There is a wall blocking the seating area from the yogurt dispensers. This is a very narrow area and you kind of get funneled through the line; there is no going back for a yogurt if you already passed it. Also, there tends to be lots of kids running around here, which can be distracting. But, if you can look past all that, you will be delighted with the delicious cup of frozen yogurt you will emerge with.

I hate to update my review with a negative. Unfortunately, the past couple of times we have been here has just been disappointing. I almost threw away my full cup of yogurt because it was so plain and boring. The yogurt was icy and not creamy at all. I had to add a ton of toppings to make it taste okay. Seating is still horrible. The cheesecake didn't taste like cheesecake. The chocolate is not good. My husband and I agreed that we won't be back :(

My husband and I were visiting for the weekend and we have a friend who is a local so we decided to give NCP a try. It is hard not to be skeptical when you walk in because it is very much a dive bar. But wait, did I just eat one of the best salads of my life here? A regular side salad? Why yes I did. Shocking? Why yes it was. We also ordered the garlic fries (thick-cut, had good garlic flavor and parm cheese on top), as well as the the Guinea Pie and Naked Pizza.  I shockingly wasn't a big fan of the homemade meatballs on the Guinea Pie, they were a bit greasy and fatty tasting for me. But the Naked pie was incredible. Our server was a riot, too. Overall I was pleasantly surprised.

Wow. So I had come here a while ago - like 2 years ago. This place has changed! The yogurt was creamy and incredibly tasty. I normally don't like the taste of sugar free yogurt, but I got the SF mint and couldn't hardly tell it was sugar free. I am glad I gave it another try - will definitely be back!

I am so happy that Groupon featured this place! The woman working on the beautiful Saturday morning that we went was extremely attentive and helpful. I needed a Mother's Day gift and she was immediately able to identify the perfect gift.  We were the only ones in there and probably stayed for 45 minutes or so. I really hope more people stop by, as it is a little hidden away because of trees out front. But it is right by the Phoenix City Grill, which is very popular. I have only been to one other tea shop, and this one offered much more in novelty items.  I will definitely be going again, when I run out of all the tea I bought!

Why would I pay $10 for a movie when I can come here at pay $8? I can always get a good seat and the concession stand prices are great. I remember coming here when I was in grade school before it was stadium style. I think it was a Harkins back then. Anyway, love Picture Show and it is the closest movie theater to my house.

I was shocked at how packed this place was on a Tuesday night. Maybe because it is Fat Tuesday and the Mexican-esque bar was celebrating Mardi Gras? Whatever, just a reason to party and the bar to make money I guess. But. I was not impressed. Nope. We were here for Happy Hour, which I didn't think was that great, although the $2 Taco Tuesday deal was pretty sweet. Unfortunately, that's all the tacos were worth, no way I'd pay full price. Plus, the service was terribly lousy. Our server was very impersonal. I suppose if you want to come here to only drink and dance on a Saturday night that'd be cool, but not if you want to just meet up after work with some friends. Whatevs.

I have been to lots of yogurt shops all around the Valley, and I think Orange Leaf is my favorite. It used to be Yogurt Builderz, but there are too many kids that run around that place. Orange Leaf has great yogurt and a nice selection of toppings. It is not too overwhelming. The yogurt is nice and creamy. I highly recommend.

I never like when a place is slow during dinner time. At 6:45, the place should have had more people. Clue #1. The people working were incredibly friendly. They were all young, so I was impressed. BUT....the food was not impressive. I had the taco salad and the chicken was dry and tasteless. My husband had a machaca burrito and there was so much tortilla, and hardly any filling. Very disappointing. We came here for a school's fundraiser so I'm not too upset, but definitely won't be back.

The Baker's Daughter is a gem of a chocolate shop in the Sunnyslope district. My husband were driving by and since I am obsessed with dessert, we just had to stop. We started off with Karl's Bakery, which is attached to The Baker's Daughter. You will find more pastries, cookies and cupcakes at Karl's. Right next door is The Baker's Daughter, who is, literally, the daughter of the woman who runs Karl's. She was classically trained in Switzerland so really knows her stuff. She was incredibly patient with me and answered all my questions. There are more than truffles there, but also gourmet desserts. Next time I am wanting to splurge on dessert I will come here.

We have come here twice to buy dishwashers for the home we live in, as well as our rental home. Both times we have been pleased with the deals we got. It is not an aesthetically pleasing store. It is pretty dingy, but if it means I save money on my appliances simply because the manufacturer was overstocked, then I am fine with that. I can overlook the dirtiness. The salespeople I have worked with have all been very nice, too.

Blech. I had a coupon in the mail for a free pizza rustico, so my husband and I tried this place one night. I ended up getting one of the thin crust pizzas, and it was awful. My husband got the baked ziti, and there was virtually no sauce on it, so it was very dry and bland. The service was also pretty poor. We did get the pizza rustico to go, however, and when I heated it up later was pretty pleased with it. But I think that might be the only good thing on the menu.

Wowza!!! I feel like a queen when I come here. The pillow, blanket and comfy reclining chairs made this the most pleasant movie-going experience I have ever had. The menu looked delicious, although the only thing I got was a Diet Coke and my hubby got a beer. The Diet Coke was movie theater priced, which was a little disappointing. Overall this is not a cheap place to go to, and I will not be utilizing this as my most frequented movie theatre, but will definitely come back on special occasions!

This was an incredibly mediocre experience. I am trying to find words to say and things to write, but everything was so incredibly plain and unimpressive that I am not inspired to write anything great or profound. We had a party of 8 and the service was fine. The decor was pretty dated. I had a salad but don't really remember much about it. I'm going to stop now because I have nothing productive to offer, it was that unmemorable.

I want to go back to Vegas not for the gambling or amazing shows, but for the Wicked Spoon Buffet. My husband and I went one Saturday evening before seeing a show, and were absolutely blown away at the food. It was not your typical buffet, where there are just vats of food available, but each item was ingeniously placed in individual serving bowls.  This limits not only waste, but allows one to try many items since you are not filling up on any one particular item. But the orechiette pasta in tomato sauce? Sounds plain but OMG!!!! Or the gnocchi in lobster ragu? Fantastic! And then there are the desserts....oh so fabulous. This place was so good, we decided to go back for breakfast the next morning!

My husband and I did not have a good experience here. I saw on the menu online that they have bruschetta, and so I was craving it for about a week. When we walked in, the place was small and very dark.  We seated ourselves, ordered waters, and looked over the menu. The waitress had a bit of a 'tude, and kept asking what drinks we wanted to order. Um, sometimes people just don't want to order a drink. Sue me. So we ordered a plate of bruschetta and the chicken salad to split. The bruschetta was so-so; not quite what I wanted. We got the salami and pesto, goat cheese and cranberry relish and feta, olive and tomato. They were a bit sparse with the toppings. The salad was actually very good, but I wish they used chunk chicken instead of sliced deli meat. Overall I will not be back. I will stick with Postino's.

Upper Crust is going through a major identity crisis. On the door it says "Patio Lounge and Wine Bar" which makes you think of Postino or some upscale snooty place, but before you even walk in you can see all the TVs showing sporting games through the windows. Are you a sports bar or a wine bar? And then you feel like you're in the middle of New York when you're sitting down and looking at the red and white checkered tablecloths and old school photos. But, there's no denying that the food is pretty tasty.  We had the Mediterranean salad to share, and a pizza with sausage and sun dried tomatoes. The chef was a little stingy on the sausage; I definitely could have used more. Someone else in our party ordered the pasta with meat sauce and it was pretty delicious. Not my favorite pizza but definitely near the top.

Okay, I SO don't get people's obsession with Grimaldi's.  This is the second time I've tried is (I thought the first time I didn't like it was because I just ordered the wrong thing), but this latest trip confirmed my dislike. And I know what it is. The cheese. Oh no, not the cheese!!!! Yes, the cheese. It tastes fake. Seriously. And when it melts it makes the pizza look like plastic. In fact, it kind of tastes like plastic, too. I liked the thin crust and the sauce, but the cheese is awful. The house salad was lacking in color and freshness, too.   Oh, and our server? I hope she was having a bad day because she had the snootiest attitude I think I've ever encountered.

This was the creamiest, dreamiest froyo I have ever had. Yumyumyum. It was a bit more expensive at 49 cents an ounce as opposed to 39 or 42 like most places, but I just got less of it which probably helped me save my calories.

First of all, I'd like to point out that I am somewhat of a fro-yo afficionado.  I have tried just about every self-serve yogurt shop you can think of. I have been known to drive 20 miles away from my home just to try a new yogurt shop. And this, my friends, is among the best.  It has themed nights, including wearing your PJ's to the shop and getting half off the price. And dude, get this...they cater!!! They will bring several flavors and toppings into your home, business, whatever. Now I need an excuse to order them for something.

Any restaurant that can get kale to taste so delicious has to be amazing. The kale salad was delicious, on the side of the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich.  So much flavor and so unique! I tried my husband's Windsor style burger and I thought it was great...and so huge! He only thought it was okay. We had the cheese fondue as a starter and the cheese was to die for! I could have used softer pretzels, but that cheese sauce just made me so happy. I enjoyed the ambiance and entire atmosphere very much. I'm happy :)

My husband and I stopped here on the way out of town, at Yelp's recommendation.  I am glad we stopped here to try a new, local place. I had the chicken sandwich and it was huge! My husband had a burger and they did not disappoint. I also got a soft serve of course, we were at Tastee Freeze! The woman working the counter was so cute and friendly. My husband had asked for no mayo on his burger, and I didn't realize mine came with mayo, so the woman noticed this and after it was made, asked if I had wanted mayo and toasted a new bun for me without me having to ask. That was so thoughtful! Will definitely stop here again.

You can't go wrong with a place that serves a half-baked cookie with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Just sayin. But that's not all we got. We came here for my mom's b-day and it was my husband and 1 year old son too. They were very accommodating for my son who is in a high chair. We had bruschetta, which is great if you like lots of garlic. We also got the pesto ziti, which was kind of lacking in flavor. Needed more basil or salt or something. Also got the spinach salad which was huge and delicious and perfect. The Italiano lasagna could have used more beef for me; it seemed to be too heavily overweighted in cheese. The service was outstanding, and we got a free pizzookie for my mom's birthday. MMMMM.

I like Chipotle. All of them. I like the food and can count on it. They let me put whatever I want on my burrito bowl and will even put more of something on if I ask. The people here have always been nice to me.

The first time I came here I was pregnant, and I felt sick afterwards. Not sure if it was because of the food or the baby. Second time I came, I didn't leave feeling much better. Not nauseous, just not happy. The place is just sub par. The meat looked disgusting just sitting there in an ice bath, all coagulated together. The veggies were fresh, but the sauce station was so old and worn that I couldn't read any of the descriptions. Our server was minimally helpful; most of the time she was hanging out with some friends in a booth, and came over once to ask if we wanted water refills. Wait, she didn't ask me if I wanted a water refill, just my husband. Overall I was really let down and will not be coming back.

Pita Jungle is possibly my favorite restaurant ever. Everrrrrrr. It's hard to get it wrong. The food is all just so delicious. This time I opted for the Mediterranean chicken salad. I normally go with the curry chicken salad which is my fave. My friend and I shared the cilantro jalapeño hummus. They only brought out one pita, waaah! The salad was nice and big. Green tea always good and drink cup full. Service friendly. The seating could have been better, there just wasn't enough of it and the high top sat too many people. Very kid friendly which is appreciated.

I consider myself an expert on fro-yo. I have been to numerous self-serve yogurt places and tried most of those more than once.  So, from experience, I know that The Chill just isn't very good. The yogurt is Grade C quality. Just not that tasty. The toppings are the same as you'd find anywhere else, but even if you piled them on, it still wouldn't make the yogurt taste any better. Sorry.

OMG this was one of the best sub sandwiches I have had in a really long time!  I had the opportunity to try a few things: 1) the black and bleu salad, which I had with the cranberry dressing.  It was really delicious and just what I was looking for. I also got to try the ham and cheese and the Italian. Both were fantastic. They used some kind of seasoning...an oil and vinegar maybe...that gave the sub such wonderful flavor. I am excited to try the Bobby next time. A friend of mine got it and she was very impressed that the bread was not soggy at all because of the cranberry sauce, but another friend said the cranberry sauce was a little too sweet. Personally I don't mind a little too sweet, but if you are sensitive to it, you might want to scrape some of the cranberry off or ask them to go light.  One con: I got a cookie and while it was delicious, I am not sure it was made there, and I really am a huge fan of cookies which are made on site.

My husband and I were like two little lost puppies when we came in here. We had no clue what to order, what anything would taste like, etc. We needed some serious help. And the server did a phenomenal job of helping coach us through the menu! I got the beingan bartha at his suggestion, which is smoked eggplant cooked with onions and peppers and was absolutely delicious. The rice it comes with is also seasoned in something, which was great. My husband ordered the Masala Dosai which came with two dips (one tomato, one coconut) on the side. We ordered a mini dosai for my son. So, okay, my son is 13 months old and we fed him everything we ordered, and he loved it. That's telling you how good it all was. Also we ordered the garlic naan which I thought could have been a bit more garlicky, but that's the only nitpicky thing I can think of. Otherwise the food and service were both fantastic!

People seem to be hatin' on this place.  I came here with my team from work and we had a wonderful experience. We came in at about 2:00 on a Tuesday, so well after the lunch crowd was gone. We basically had the place to ourselves, and the server was very attentive.  The prices were in line with what you will pay at other gourmet burger joints, but the beer was a little steeply priced. $5 for a can of Moose Drool seems a little excessive. But overall we had a great time and I would come back here with my husband anytime.

At a friend's recommendation, I went here with my husband and another couple for dinner. I am glad I took that recommendation. It was surprisingly slow for a Saturday night. We sat on the back patio that had misters and cool fans that were cleverly place in the wheels of bicycles. Our first server was phenomenal, I wish we had him the whole time. We got the cheese platter which was huge and delicious and by far the best I have had anywhere for a great price. 4 of us split it, and honestly, I didn't even need to order dinner because it filled me up. But, I did order the romaine salad which was fantastic. I tried my husband's brisket sandwich and the sauce was to die for. My friend had the cheeseburger which she said was only okay, but that was on the expectation that it would be fantastic because the cheese platter was so good. The beer was decent; my husband who is a brewer actually was not that impressed. But overall I thought the food was wonderful and I would definitely go back.

Have I lost my mind? Did I really order a brisket salad.....in....a gas station? YES! And did it completely blow my mind? YES! The Campfire Bistro is the dining portion of Tom's Thumb Fresh Market. And it is unbelievable. You can come here for breakfast (yes, they serve brisket at 7:30 am), lunch or dinner. The old gas station had closed down and a very enterprising man opened the new and vastly improved full service gas station, food counter and gourmet market. They have fresh and delicious baked goods and a (mostly) full coffee shop. It was a real treat to come in and experience the wonder that a gas station can offer. In fact, I would say that you should come here for the food, and get your car filled up with gas while you're at it, instead of the other way around.

Well I guess I lucked out and came on a good night. It was pretty busy at 6 pm on a Friday night, which means that people like it enough to go there early. I thoroughly enjoyed my build-your-own chicken burger on which I got a ton of the veggies. It kind of fell apart since there were too many veggies, so I would recommend just choosing a couple. My husband really liked his b-y-o hamburger, too. It wasn't too greasy, but now we understand why it is called Smashburger. They literally smashed his burger to a pulp so it fell apart very easily. Got the smash fries which had a lot of olive oil on the top but not the bottom. Our chocolate malt was good but we got it about 10 minutes late since the runner girl gave ours to a different couple who came in after us. Boo. And when you deliver our food and I tell you that we are still waiting for our malt and you take 10 minutes to bring it out to me, that is not acceptable.  I expect it to be made ASAP since you already should have had it to me 10 minutes earlier. But that is just me being picky I guess.

Perhaps I had a different experience because I ate a catered sandwich by them. My company ordered 200 boxed sandwich lunches today and I was incredibly disappointed. We have used many other sandwiches places in the past, but wanted to try something new. The bread was stale, they were very stingy with the meat, the choco chip cookie was burnt and tasted like it came out of a packaged box.  I am really disappointed in their catering services. I won't spend my own money on a sandwich here, which is sad because other people gave it such great reviews.

Well hello Cafe Zupas, I'm glad to meet you! Welcome to the neighborhood, I hope you will stick around.  The bbq chicken salad you created was delicious, and I especially loved the fun drink bar, which let me make my own Italian soda.  My husband liked his summer chicken salad and turkey bacon panini. And that free chocolate covered strawberry at the end? Awesome! I was very satisfied after eating at Cafe Zupas. Not too full but just right. I appreciate new restaurants that are quick, healthy and not too expensive!

My husband and I came in on a Monday night because we saw they have a $5 Charr burger special. Its hard to beat that price, so we thought we'd give it a shot. I'm glad we did! We both got the Charr burger, and it was great. The meat was cooked perfectly, and I like how they give you one big, thick burger instead of two small ones. The pretzel bun was also good, but could have been pretzel-ier. I wanted to try the turkey burger, but since the $5 special only applied to the Charr burger, I had regular beef. But next time I go back, and I will go back, then I will pay full price and try something else.

The hubsters and I came here on date night recently. It was around 6:15 on a Saturday night, and surprisingly slow. I had the Cream Ale and it was yummy. The husband tried the Session and Irish Red and liked both. We split the House salad which was bomb, the pizza bread which sucked, and the fennel sausage pizza which was good. The service was lacking until I spoke up and said we wanted some help, and then the guy was super polite and attentive. Was a little pushy in trying to get us to order...dude, just give me a couple minutes to look over the menu, okay? But all in all it was good and we love little breweries like this.

I got the Southwest Cobb and my husband got half a New Yorker and a cup of chicken dumpling soup. My salad was huge and soooo good. The lettuce was extremely fresh and green. I loved every bite of it. I had a bite of my husband's sandwich and the meat was tender and flavorful. I enjoyed his soup, but he didn't like it. He expected real dumplings, like the biscuit kind, but instead they were more like noodles. The soup was also very thick like they added a lot of cornstarch instead of creamy like I would think chicken and dumpling soup would be. Still good, just not quite what one expects. But overall, I would definitely come back.

I am such a huge fan of Sprouts' deli and produce. I always look forward to getting it ad in the mail to find out what I am going to buy there for lunches and dinners the next week. I buy the produce that's on sale and it is usually good. Sometimes the apples are hit or miss, but it depends on the time of year. Their non-perishables are a bit more expensive than the regular grocery store, but if you look in the ad sometimes they will have great deals. I especially love the buy one, get one free deals!

So this place was very cool! I came here for lunch with a co-worker and I was very impressed with both the service and the food. Our server was one of the owners I think, or maybe his Mom owns it? Either way when we ordered the tabbouli (fantastic), he said that his Mom makes it fresh everyday. WHAT!?! I've got a little old Lebanese woman making my tabbouli in the back? Sweet! You know that has to be good. And, we commented on how good it smelled and he brought over the incense that was burning and gave us a package for free. Impressive! The place could use a little decor to make it feel more Middle Eastern, but that's about it. It is kind of tucked away so I hope that doesn't prevent it from getting enough foot traffic.

I appreciate the options of Yogurt Plus. There is a concern for health and several of the flavored are sweetened naturally, with fructose or stevia. They taste different, but that's to be expected. I don't like how the counter person has to get your samples for you. It's is somewhat belittling to the customer. I get that some people go way overboard in the samples, but most of us are mature enough only to get a small amount anyway. It just seems stingy and the poor counterperson is running back and forth to get samples for people and trying to help people check out. Just too much going on. But good selection of both yogurt and toppings.

Fantastic! I was super happy with Saladworks. I came here for lunch with 5 co-workers and it was delicious. We arrived a bit before the lunch rush and got our food quickly, I had the combo with the Bently salad (didn't want the cheese so they let me sub anything I wanted...I chose avocado), and the Monterey Chicken sandwich. The bread was fresh and warm. The serving sizes were generous and the staff was very friendly. I will absolutely be back.

I had been here once before for a large event, and got to try a bunch of their dishes and remember thinking that all of them were so good! My husband, toddler and I came here for HH tonight and again, I was impressed! I ordered the sunset sangria which was awesome. Not too sweet like most sangrias, definitely more of a cocktail. We split the truffle deviled eggs, honey crispy chicken, and Louisiana bousin fritters. The fritters weren't my favorite, oh well, my husband had no problem eating them. The chicken was delicious, I especially loved the gravy and biscuit. The eggs were very tasty. The quality of food is very high and the chef truly is an artist.

I had a LivingSocial and got a back to back massage and facial. Both were absolutely fabulous. I like how they don't have contracts, but instead you can pay for your next visit in advance and get a discounted rate. THe only caveat is that you can't then cancel that appointment. Smart business for them. But, Zeina was my massage therapist and no one has ever been able to get as deep as her. She really knows what she is doing. I will definitely come back for massages (already have!) but not facials, as apparently they can't keep good aestheticians around.

I came here a little skeptical because I don't like fish. I got the chicken tacos which were absolutely incredible. There was so much flavor and complexity to them. The slaw on top was great, the sauce was awesome, and they were big and meaty. I was a little annoyed that I couldn't get 1 chicken and 1 steak taco, because they "proportion" the meat for the cooks, so it was for their convenience, not mine. I would have appreciated if they would take the customer into consideration when making these decisions and accommodate that. So 1 star off for that. Otherwise, absolutely delicious.

I met some friends here on a Saturday morning. We sat outside and it was lovely. I got the Farmhouse omelette and loved every bite. They each got the Eggs Benedict and seemed to enjoy them. The omelette was fresh and flavorful. The hashbrown were just the kind I like, thinly sliced and had a great brown crisp on the top. Our server was a bit bummed we didn't order bottomless mimosas, so he didn't pay too good of attention to us. Plus, every time we got our coffee refilled, it was only warm. We brought it to their attention and they seemed surprised, but took forever to brew a new pot and get our cups refilled. Stars for the food and ambiance.

I came in to get my husband beer making supplies for his birthday. I was very excited to not have to travel to What Ale's Ya, since this place is right by my work. The man working was so nice and patient. Quite a change from what I am used to since I don't know a lot about brewing beer. They are not pretentious at all. They have beers in a kit, all grain brewing (which is what I was here for), wine making supplies, etc. Bottles, caps, sanitizers...you name it, and they have it.

What a really, really cool concept! I had only mildly been exposed to custard before, and had Italian Ice waaaaay back when I was just a little girl. But to put the two together! Oh, yes! The custard was so creamy, and I even had the LIght Vanilla! The passionfruit ice was great, and I also sampled the Mint Chip Cream Ice. I love this concept and will definitely come back.

Wow, this shaved ice is waaaaay different than the snow cones I remember as a kid!! There were so many flavors; I had the pink champagne and it was perfect. Not too sweet or fruity. And if you're willing to put a splash of vodka in there, I'm not gonna say no. The guys working, the "bartenders" as they called themselves, were both very friendly and enthusiastic. Definitely a hit at any party!

My husband and I ordered out from Pezzano's for the first time. At 6:10 on a Friday it was only a 15 minute wait. We got the Hawaiian pizza and bruschetta. The Hawaiian was good and the cheese was the freshest I've ever had. It was kind of oblong shape, so I know they had just hand thrown the crust. The bruschetta was warm and dripping with olive oil. Honestly, I could have done with a little less olive oil and more basil, but everything was incredibly fresh and the guys working there were super cool.

The hubby and I came here on Sunday night at dinnertime, which must not be a popular time of day to go to a sandwich shop because we were the only ones in there. But when I opened the door, I thought, "oh wow, what a cute little place!" Kudos for decorations and a fun theme. I had to strain my neck to see the menu, which was way up high on the wall. I appreciated how I could get "thin" bread, where they slice some of it off so there is 1/3 less. I got the Mediterranean with no cheese and added chicken. It was stuffed well with peppers, artichokes and the likes. The prices were very fair for what you got. I don't know if its the most awesome sandwich I've ever eaten, but I would definitely go back. I tried my husband's Wreck and thought it was pretty tasty.

Yeah I'm down with this place. I got the chicken salad and my husband got the double char cheeseburger. He had been here before and couldn't wait to take me. We also got our son a single hamburger. He enjoyed it (he's only 17 months and a picky eater, so I was so pleased he liked it!). My salad was huge and very filling. My husband loved his burger. The fries were good but I was a little disappointed when I saw the guy behind the grill pulling out frozen fries and putting them in the deep fryer. What do I expect from a chain restaurant, but still. Fresh cut fries would be nice.

This is the second painting studio I've been to. The two were very similar - you bring your friends, your own wine, and there are a bunch of canvases that allow a bunch of people to take a class at the same time and learn how to channel their inner Bob Ross. What I liked about Pinot's Palette was the staff. He guy who led us through the "class" was so energetic and enthusiastic. Plus, good looking :)). It was also nice that there was a camera on the teacher's canvas which was displayed on a 42" TV. Really showed the painting up close. Overall I had a lot of fun and would come back.

Best massage therapists ever. Everyone I have had is awesome. I like deep tissue, and no one has failed to disappoint. My favorite is Kimberley, but Lastly is good and another woman but I forget her name!  I feel terrible. I have a monthly membership and only every do the massages, usually will do a 2 hour one because I need it so bad. The place is very warm and inviting, and you feel like an actual, valued client, instead of just a number. I love it here.

It was really neat getting a sampling of the new bar menu that Outback will be introducing in the near future. The drinks were all delicious - I had the sangria and skinny rita. I couldn't even tell that the margarita was "skinny" - it was so satisfying! The food was good; I especially liked the flatbread. The nachos were very unique, I hadn't had any on barbecue potato chips before! I really liked getting to know the other people at my table and the intimate environment, but also we could mingle if we wanted to. It was all very well designed.

Okay, so I gave this place another shot. And I am so glad I did. My husband was craving a burger and it was "date night" so we went here. The service was good (really great at first, then it waned off toward the middle and end of the meal). We got to sample different beers before finally ordering one so that was nice. The beer menu was very outdated, so you have to ask the server what they currently have. I got the chicken and quinoa kale salad which I was conflicted about since I really did want a burger but the salad sounded soooooooo good, and it was! My husband got the build your own burger. I love how you can choose your protein, type of bun (pretzel roll!!), cheese, veggies, sauce, etc. I was tempted to try the White Balsamic Mint sauce on a turkey burger...see why I was conflicted?!?! We also got the sweet potato fries which were good and crispy. My husband didn't care for the sweet dip it comes with, but I liked it. Overall the experience was much better and I am happy we came back.

Yeah, so this was pretty good. I was somewhat skeptical after reading the negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. We came in on a Sunday night and it was very quiet. Really surprised at how slow it was. My husband and I got the 3 for $20 deal, and got the chicken flatbread for an appetizer and it was just swimming in cheese. A little too much for me tasted good. I got the Asian Chicken Salad and it was great! The lettuce was fresh, and plentiful. Hubby got a burger and was happy with it. My F-I-L got the reuben and seemed to like it. Bro-In-Law got a pizza off the 3 for $10 menu and it looked a little piddly to me. We then got the cookie and ice cream dessert and it was just like a pizzookie - soooo good!! Overall a pretty good deal especially if you do the 3 for $20 deal (1 appetizer and 2 entrees).

What a waste of time. We came on the last day, the Glendale Glitters "and Glow". This reminded me of a carnival but without the rides. The crowds were horrific, parking sucked, and there were lots of disgusting, fried food eateries and cheap vendors lining the park. My husband, 15 mo old son and I got some kettle corn and quickly left.

I bought a Groupon for the BBQ basics course - the 6 hour one where we learn how to do basic grilling and smoking. My husband and I had a great time learning lots of information...the importance of using a binder before putting on a rub, making sure we inject our meat before putting it on the grill, and most importantly, that grilling is a concept, not a science! Lynda was our teacher and Brandon was the griller. We ended up learning a lot more about smoking that I was expecting, especially considering that only 3 people in the whole class even had a smoker. It would have been more beneficial to learn about every day things that people grill, since most people don't smoke a brisket very often. That should have been more of a specialty class. What about the burgers and brats, haha! But the class was incredibly interactive; I really enjoyed the hands on time in which we got to prepare the meat and see it on the grill. It would have been nice to have the "snack" earlier in the day, say after 2.5 hours or so, because 4 hours was a long time to wait before eating. I am excited to put to use the skills I learned in this class!!

Sam Fox does it again! None of his restaurants have disappointed me, The Henry included. The ambiance and atmosphere was so hip and cool, but not pretentious at all. We sat outside and watched all the fancy cars roll up, which was kinda fun. The back patio had pretty lights all around. And the food, was of course, totally legit. We split the cheddar popovers and ate all of them. I got the fatoosh salad, which although it was heavy on the dressing, I had no trouble polishing off. My husband really enjoyed his corned beef sandwich. The service was great, and I appreciated the manager coming out to check on us. She even asked if the dressing was too heavy and offered to make a new salad, which I declined because I don't like to send back food. But the offer was much appreciated. Overall, great experience.

Okay, so I ended up at Sandpiper Elementary to try the burgers here after looking at their calendar and seeing that's where they'd be on my husband's birthday; turns out it was the school's art fair and that's why the truck was at the school! But that didn't stop us from eating one heck of a delicious burger. We both had the Aioli burger and fries. The burger was absolutely fantastic! The aioli is fresh made, requires refrigeration, and is truly gourmet. The fries were a little salty, but the burger is really why you go to a gourmet burger place, so who cares? The only thing is that it was quite a bit of a wait because it is so small in that little truck and there was only the one guy cooking.

What a great new restaurant in the Scottsdale Airpark area! I can see how it would be quick and easy (and healthy!) for lunch, but we came here for dinner on a Friday night. It was quite slow at 6:15 so the gal behind the counter was super patient with us. I got the brown rice, chicken, steamed veggies, and mango-lime sauce with a half ladle of the peanut sauce. Yum-o! It is so cool how you can select your sauces and there are about 8 to choose from. And its great how they mix and match so you can blend your own flavors. I appreciated how I could taste the sauces before committing to one. There was plenty of food and even for dinner, I only ate about half. I didn't like that it was dark meat chicken; I am a white meat kinda girl. But overall a fan, and with how quick, easy and convenient it is, I am planning on coming back!

The hubs and I came here before a movie. We unlocked a free garlic knots by checking in - score! They were soft and covered with garlic butter. Like, really garlicky which is perfect for me. We split the Italian sausage pizza and a salad - can't remember which- but it was very good. The oven is one of those big 900 degree heat ovens with the tiny tiles all around it. I have seen one just like it at another pizza parlor and they had flown it in from Italy, and wonder if they did the same here; shoulda asked. That being said, every pizza gets a different "doneness", with some more crispy and brown than others. Ours turned out good. The server was wonderful and attentive and very friendly.

I have been going to Rebecca for years. At least 15. I trust her implicitly. It has gotten to the point where all I have to do is sit down in the chair and she goes to work. She knows me, my hair, what works, and what looks good. She always takes such great care of me. And I love that she can get me in short notice because I am horrible at making appointments. Go see Rebecca, you won't be disappointed!

Yeah, really bummed out about this. I was so excited to try this place and it just really disappointed. The pizza was plain and boring. We ordered the sausage and onion one and there was nothing compelling about it. The house salad was great, but I came here for the pizza. Not enough sauce, too much bread. Blah.

Modern Grove has all the makings of a great restaurant. It really reminded me of one of Sam Fox's restaurants, like True Food or something. So adorable inside and out. But that just did not make up for the poor quality food. The bruschetta was pretty good, we got the tomato, pesto and salami, and roasted peppers and goat cheese. I liked the latter 2, but the tomato was...meh. I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and there was absolutely nothing special or unique about it. Like other readers, I found the chicken to taste weird. I asked the server where it was cooked (suspected it was a fully cooked frozen patty when they purchased it), and after avoiding me for about 10 mins, I asked again, and she said her cook was on break and she'd have the answer soon. Answer was that they overnight the chicken, and she overemphasized that they keep it in the refrigerator until they use it, or they freeze it before it goes bad. Well whoop de do! Good for you, MG! You refrigerate your meat!! Anyway, things were just not good, and it seems like they cut corners in a lot of places by buying pre-made food items and not really cooking anything from scratch. My husband got the BBQ cheddar burger and the bun was huge but the burger patty was itty bitty. Just because you have a huge bun doesn't fool me on the actual burger size!  Although the fries were tasty :). So overall very disappointed. Don't let Modern Grove fool you into thinking they are fresh or healthy.

I really was not so impressed with this "Mediterranean" restaurant. Yes, it had hummus. Yes, it had dolmades. Yes, it had gyro. But it was the most inauthentic tasting Mediterranean food I've had. I got the chicken pita and it was incredibly plain; no seasonings or anything. We were offered a sample of the falafel which was a mistake because it was fried waaay too long. Not a good impression. The dolmades were decent, but not worth saving this place.

Wow I have been to few restaurants as interesting as this one. Mexican Asian fusion. Huh. I came with a group of 4 girls on a Thursday night. We wanted to get happy hour prices but they only serve that in the bar area and there were no seats. We shared a lot of small plates. We started with the pomegranate guac which was great, and I liked the chips it came with. They were very big round, freshly fried tortilla chips. The veggie roll was good with a big slice of avocado on top. The pho was interesting. Not my favorite, it did not resemble pho whatsoever. It tasted like warm salsa. We also got the beef tacos (bomb!) and chicken tacos, also delicious. The kimchi rice was also good. The server forgot about our rice until we almost had to leave, but we really wanted to try it so we hung around for them to finally bring it out. The service could have been better, our guy seemed a little aloof. My green tea was empty for too long, too many times. But interesting food, and beautiful, cool environment.

We had a coupon for a free appetizer or penny draft beer, so my husband and I decided to give this place a go. I am so glad we did! UB has its own beer, which it outsources to local companies. I like how it serves so much local beer. I got the union Hefe which was light and slightly citrusy. For our meal, we got the shaken chopped salad, the CCB, and the other grilled cheese with prime rib. All were very good. The prime rib one was so flavorful. The CCB was a little dry. The fries could have used more time in the fryer. But the service was great and the atmosphere was really nice. We sat outside.  The grilled cheeses definitely seem to be where it's at. Would definitely come back.

I met a few friends here on a Sunday evening and we were greeted with low lights and candles on the table. Quite romantic for 3 girls getting together to catch up. Anyway, we each got a glass of wine and the server was really fun, telling us how they all have to go through a training something like once a month and taste all the wines on the menu. Sounds like a tough job. So she gave us good guidance on what to order. We then placed a food order - 2 boards of bruschetta (pretty much ordered every option except for the one with mushrooms) and a kale salad. Love the bruschetta, hands down the best in the valley. Always full of topping and the bread is soft and delicious. The salad was good as well. Overall had fun and enjoyed this new location.

I found my new to-go place for Chinese food. I have gotten a few things on their menu and have been happy with everything. I like how you can see them cooking in the back. The cashiers aren't the brightest, so be patient. Also, make sure if you ask for brown rice, they give it to you. Otherwise, really delicious food.

I reviewed Musicology when it was at the other location, and since it moved, it has gotten even better! There are so many new class times, and the space is perfect. The teachers all are so knowledgeable and clearly love working with children. We took our first son here when he was little, and now take our second son to because we really saw the benefits of the program. Hands on learning, interaction, play, and undivided attention. It is good for parents and the babies/children! Our first son is so smart and had great vocabulary, etc, and I attribute a lot of they to Musicology. Of course, we made sure to do a lot of the games and activities at home, too. I really cannot recommend Musicology enough.

I am in love, love, love with Fox Restaurants. Never been disappointed with anything I've had. The atmosphere was fun and engaging. We got the pretzels for an appetizer and they were soft and fluffy little pillows that I absolutely adored. And I might have drank the cheese sauce it was so good. I got the kale salad and every bite was delicious. My husband also really liked his Italian sandwich, although it wouldn't have been my first choice. They were out of the beer I wanted, so I ordered another; and it was fine. Just a little annoying when they run out of their special beers on tap. But still, I had a great time.

This is my most favorite place for a girl's night out, ever. I yelped "girls night out", and this is what was suggested. I am so glad my girlfriend and I came here. We had the best time. We got the tasting card, and ended up having about 6 samples each. We got the bruschetta (all of which was phenomenal - the best bruschetta I've ever had!!! Even better than Postino's, and that used to be my high water mark). The Italian sandwich was amazing, our server was so much fun, and it was an overall great night. We ended up spending about 3 hours here!

Oh, yes. Scottsdale Beer Company you are my new favorite. My husband and I came here on his birthday and he got a free pint. Whaaaat?!? I ordered a Hefe which was delicious and not too citrusy, it was more banana-y. The pretzel was good, and the sauce it came with. The roasted beet salad was awesome. I also enjoyed my husband's sandwich. I don't remember what kind it was, but is was good. We are looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu.

I was happy with this place. I had the chicken enchiladas from the skinny menu, and they were very filling and satisfying. My husband had the BLT and tortilla soup. Their messed up and put mayo on his sandwich even though he asked them not to, so the manager bought us dessert. That was a nice touch.

I came here on the invitation of Thirsty Lion to have a complimentary meal, and I would definitely go back as a paying customer! The place is huge and great for after work happy hours! We had the pretzel to share and it stayed soft the whole time, which I admit was not long because it was so good! I had a salad for lunch, and it was fresh and flavorful. I had a bite of my husband's panini and it was full of meat and very hearty. The decor is interesting, kind of piece-mealed together, but whatever. We still had a great time and the service was good, too.

I have been to the other two OHSO locations and this  is by far my favorite!! Not only because it is only about a half mile from my house (I am one lucky girl!!), but the whole vibe of the place is so chill and relaxed and a place I could spend hours. My husband and I came on a Friday for lunch, and it was busy but not too busy. We sat outside and there was a nice breeze and a huge fan for the summer months - I'm talking 8 feet tall. The food was delicious - I had the ensalada del sol and really enjoyed it. My husband had the regular burger and I had a bite and loved it. The bread was so soft. My MIL came previously and had the Chinese chicken salad and said it was really good. Happy hour for drinks is 11-6 M-F, and you can get a small pitcher of beer for $6. That's about 2.25 beers. What a deal! Food specials are from 3-6 and then after 9 (or 10??). We did see some kids who were acting a little unruly - their parents were letting them play in the fountain and dip rocks into it, etc. I'm not so mad at the kids as I am at the parents, I just think that's unacceptable. But the owners didn't try to stop them or say anything nor did anyone who worked there, so I figured if they were okay with it, then I didn't much care. We sat in the nice Adirondack chairs in the sun for a while and I could have taken a nap there. Really a great location and a great restaurant, I will be coming back.

I love big breakfasts and brunches. Omelets, soft, fluffy pancakes, hot coffee, mmm. We were visiting friends and came here on a Sunday morning. Our server was great and the food was fantastic. I got an omelet and had hash browns, with the pot of bread beforehand. The taste of everything was just outstanding. My friend made the mistake of letting me try her blueberry pancakes and I aye about half of them, haha. I wish we had one of these places in Phoenix.

I finally have my go-to place for fresh, healthy salads! I am in love with the Siam I Am. I cannot bear to bring myself to order something different. They all look amazing though, so one day I will need to. The teas are all delicious; I usually don't order a drink with my meal, but I have to here since they are so tasty. I like how everything is so fresh, and you can customize any salad. If you don't want something in yours, they will let you substitute something else at no charge! The seating is a little poor here; not enough inside seats for the summer and a little disjointed with a huge wall in the middle of the floor. But overall, really great.

Horrible. Awful. Don't go. It was expensive and really not that impressive. I thought that with the admission would be the kid's play area (that's why we went), but they charge you extra to go in the bounce houses and down the slide. Ridiculous. And, you have to buy the food tickets in packs, so if you buy a pack of 20 and only need 16, then you've just wasted money. It really is so sneaky. That combined with how crowded it was really made it not worth it.

Its been a while since I have been here, but I don't think I've ever been disappointed. I got the simple beef salad, and it was huge and filling. I also shared the California rolls with my friend. Quick and easy. The décor could use some updating, but good food.

Wowww. Lasagna pizza, chopped salad, meatball bruschetta, I can still taste it all! I am a big time salad fan, and the chopped salad is one of my new all time favorites. The meatball bruschetta tasted like a meatball sub and was thick and hearty. I now know why the restaurant is called "Sauce", because all of the sauces were absolutely delicious. I haven't been to Sauce in years so am so glad to reconnect and know my family will be returning here soon!
