My husband could spend hours here talking beer... and I'll let him. Seriously, though... knowledgeable people, inviting shop. Can't go wrong here.

I'm a notorious slacker when it comes to the whole waxing thing, especially since I really don't do much more than my eyebrows. I was really impressed that not only were they able to fit me in at the last minute (there was a cancellation) but that the whole thing took about 10 minutes flat, and looked great! As one of the other reviewers said, there is definite pushing of "product," but really, what salon doesn't do that?

I'm always on the lookout for sushi on the west side of town... and this one is a winner. Combine a creative menu, generous servings, and affordable prices, and you've got a winner here. The owner and staff are extremely friendly and talkative, too - definitely a plus!

Reasonable prices, great service, and everyone who worked there seemed to be enjoying themselves,which is always a plus.  Edited - Not sure what they put on when I got my soak-off gels...but these did NOT soak off. Theory is that they used regular gel under the soak-offs - completely defeating the purpose. They looked nice, but wouldn't come off without filing.

I really only come here for the Skyrobics classes, but I am impressed. You wouldn't think jumping around in a trampoline was hard work, but it is! They could use a little more staffing at the front desk when its busy, though - the wait can be long.

I wasn't looking for much by way of service, considering the newness of the place and the past reviews, but I think the food is much more important, anyway. I was very pleasantly surprised by the service, though, and M Sushi didn't disappoint on the food front either. The sushi was super-fresh and creative. I can't say much for the cooked items (gyoza/beef teriyaki), though. They were eh...not good, but not bad. On the other hand, I don't go to sushi restaurants for the cooked stuff :-)
