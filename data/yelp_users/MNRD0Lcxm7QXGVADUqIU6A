Came here with my bf for a late breakfast. Our server was genuine, sweet and made sure we were taken care of. We started with the giant cinnamon roll, which was yummy.  I ordered the New Princess omelet with a side of corned beef hash. Filled with bacon, broccoli, onion (and a few other things I can't remember), stuffed with cream cheese and smothered in hollandaise, this omelet was hands down the best I've ever had. It came with these breakfast potato chips on the side that were so SO good! The hash was traditional, just the way I like it.  My bf ordered a begin waffle with a side of biscuits and gravy, sausage links and French toast. He said his french toast was eggier than he prefers but that might just be his personal preference.  Overall great experience- we will definitely be back!

My boyfriend and I decided to grab a bite to eat here a few days ago. It was late- I think 9pm and they close at 10pm. We were greeted sweetly by the hostess and seated. Our waitress arrived promptly with our drinks, menus and bread. She explained the specials and gave us her recommendations. We started with the calamari appetizer, which was absolutely delicious! They have the best calamari in town! It was cooked perfectly and covered in a thin, crispy breading- just the way we like it!   My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan with the Sicilian chicken soup, and I ordered the lobster ravioli and salad with the house dressing (both of which she recommended to me). Our food arrived fast and everything was delicious. I have no complaints. The salad was crisp and refreshing and the dressing was so darn good!!! My raviolis were cooked perfectly and filled with a creamy lobster filling. My boyfriend's chicken soup was very, very good- better than my mothers, which says a lot!! His chicken parmesan was everything its supposed to be: tender, juicy, and served with the perfect balance of mozzarella and pomodoro sauce.   I am very pleased with our experience at Carrabba's. We arrived an hour before closing and did not feel rushed by the staff at all. Great service and food was provided to us, and I will not forget that! We will definitely come back!

Horrible, inexcusable service every single time I have gone. Staff is ignorant of its customers, slow and never seem like they care. I knew that had bad service, but I have never been so infuriated at a restaurant than the staff made me the other night. I called in an order for pick up, it was a Thursday night. The woman taking my order told me 45 minutes. 45 minutes?! For a Cali roll and a spicy tuna roll?! Whatever.   I waited an hour before leaving to pick it up, just to be safe.  When I got there, the hostess took one look at me, grabbed her purse and proceeded to leave. I asked about my order and she simply said, "They'll help you", and walked out. RUDE. I waited at the hostess station for 15 minutes. No one came to help me. I was ignored by the bartenders and other staff members. After the 15 minutes I walked back to the sushi bar and asked one of the cooks about my order. He spoke very broken english, and told me he didn't know about my order and to ask the bar.   So, I walked over to the bar, stood right up next to it and waited to be helped. Nothing. For another 15 minutes at least!!! It was completely ridiculous- they weren't even busy! I finally got  the attention of one of the 2 bartenders by waving my arm over the counter. He came over and I told him I had a to-go order. He said okay and took my card to ring it up. 10 minutes later my order was FINALLY given to me. I think the manager on duty was the one who gave it to me, and he just handed it to me and walked away.   So after over AN HOUR AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES I finally received my food. What a joke.  This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. The service here is so terrible that everyone should be fired, and there are people out there who would actually be grateful to have a job here and could give way better service. This is only one of the many horrid experiences I've had at this location. Something needs to be done.

Speedy service, great beverages and super friendly staff. I come here almost every day and I've never been disappointed. I looove the ham and cheese breakfast sandwich, the everything bagel and the caesar salad. The Tazo teas are delicious both iced and hot, and I love the coffee as well. One thing I might add is that I didn't particularly care for the cheese croissant because it was too sweet for me, but I've loved everything else.  :)

My boyfriend and I decided to come here this afternoon to get the lobster ravioli, which is delicious. We were seated only to find they did not have that dish at this location! That was disappointing.   Started with the jalapeno cilantro hummus, it was pure deliciousness. My boyfriend got a burger, and I decided to go with the grilled shrimp and salmon salad. I asked for it without red onion.   Our food came quickly, and to my dismay my salad was infested with not only red onion, but white onion too! White onion wasn't even on the description of the dish. The salmon was tough and tasted absolutely horrible (couldn't decide if it was cooked frozen or just expired!). The balsamic dressing lacked flavor. The only edible thing in the salad were the shrimp, and I think there was only four of them. It was disgusting, do not order it.  My boyfriend asked for yellow mustard for his burger, and they didn't have any. They serve burgers!!! Why would they not have that?! There are many neighboring restaurants that I'm sure have it, and it was slow. Our waitress could have easily gone next door and got some. He doesn't like ketchup, so he decided to just take it home and eat it with mustard rather than eat it plain at the restaurant.  After about twenty minutes our waitress dropped off the check. She didn't even ask how the food was, or give me a chance to tell her, and both of our plates were pretty much untouched at this point. After waiting twenty more minutes, she brought the credit card back so we could leave, and we did.   I give it one star because the hummus was delicious, and my boyfriend told me he enjoyed his burger when he had it at home. Service was lacking. It is a server's job to take care of the guests of the restaurant, and I did not feel that we were taken care of today. We will not be coming back.

Way better than Raising Cane's.   My boyfriend works at Raising Cane's chicken strips and one day we found out about this place, and wanted to compare the food. We walked in, and were greeted by the owner who took our order and asked if it was our first time. We told him it was, and he recommended the special, which came with 3 tenders(i'm pretty sure), toast, waffle fries and your choice of sauce.They have their special sauce, ranch, barbecue, a tangy sweet/sour sauce, and a honey mustard sauce to chose from. We both went with the special sauce to compare it to Cane's.   When we sat a the table to wait, there were mini Connect4 games there waiting for us to play with while we waited for our food. What an awesome idea!!  We got our food fast, and it was hot! Our plates were loaded, and it looked and smelled delicious. The owner gave us each two extra tenders to try on the house, which were dipped in wing sauce. They were out of this world. He also gave us one of each kind of sauce to try. Rock-n-Roll Fingers' special sauce tasted almost identical to the sauce at Raising Canes, but it was a little thicker in consistency, and just tasted better. The regular chicken tenders were heavenly! I prefer their breading to Cane's, as it was lighter and crispier, and the chicken was wayyy juicier here. The waffles fries were to die for, and so was the Texas toast.  If you're a fan of Raising Cane's, you have got to try Rock-n-Roll Fingers. You will never eat at Cane's again. You don't need to take my word for it, go try it for yourself!

I come here once a week (at least), and I always leave happy. They have a great happy hour menu- $1 miso soup and $2.50 for edamame!  The Dragon Roll is very very good, and the eel it's topped with is delicious. Sometimes sushi restaurants use cheap eel, which is fatty and gross, but here that is not the case. I also regularly enjoy the Crispy California roll, the Tootsie roll and Shrimp Tempura roll.   I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. I have experienced great service here time and time again, which is key for my return. The wait staff is always super friendly, quite hospitable and give good recommendations.   I love this place. I'm always craving it!

Great gyros, especially the chicken gyro! I love their tzatziki too. Food is always up quick and the service is good. Their greek side salads are also very tasty.

This place is heaven on Earth. Best fried chicken I have ever had hands down. Also, I've always recieved wonderful customer service from all of the staff at Lo-Lo's. Everyone is always smiling and happy, and I can tell they enjoy working there. Everything I have tried from here is more than delicious! Their mac n' cheese is the bomb. Their corn bread is spongy, sweet and perfect. Buttered corn is good. Smothered potatoes- delicious. The chicken and waffles is to die for. If you have not been here yet, GO NOW! :) I love love love this place, and so do the friends and family I have introduced to it.

Delicious bread and mayonnaise spread. I get the Faded Turkey sandwich almost every time! I've also experience really good service there. Really hits the spot!

My bf ordered us food from here to go. Best cheese burger I've EVER had. Juicy patty, cheddar cheese, toasted bun.  It was darn good. I want one right now just thinking about it. Wings are good too.  Bit of a biker bar which isn't really my scene, but I can't pass up a good burger!

My favorite club in Old Town. Their tacos are supreme. We had Kassie as our server for bottle service and she was awesome! I will definitely be back :)
