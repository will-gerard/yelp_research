They wanted 30 dollars to hem a apron..when I told them that's too expensive they told me I can go somewhere else and gave me my apron. Don't like to give bad reviews to little shops but it was upsetting

I loveeeee Chipotle! omg soo good! I get the burrito bowl with rice, veggies, chicken and guac and it is amazing! I try to be alil bit more healthy so I dont get the tortilla. Anyways I love that and the chips with guac are absolutely wonderful! The guac is alil expensive and the meal can get alil pricey but I think it is well worth it. If my hips would allow it I would be here everyday ha ;)

Came here for a cup of soup to go. I guess there is a spot for pick up orders and the regular line. I assumed since I was taking to go I would be able to order my soup and go since I had to be back in to work in 15 minutes. The girl at the register asked me for a pick up order and I told her I didn't know I had to call ahead and I just wanted a cup of soup to go. She informed me Id have to wait in the regular mile long line just to get a to go order because I had not ordered it on the phone. So I can go outside place the order on my phone and pick it up..but when it comes to asking you in the store I cant? If someone is getting something to go most of the time its because their in a hurry and need to get back to work. She was very rude and told me well the line is going pretty fast anyways. Well needless to say by the time I got the soup and returned to work my break was up and I couldn't even eat the soup! I really loved Wildflower but I that put such a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think I'll ever return.

I really loved this place! Don't know what the reviews are bad because i had a great experience. We started with the chips and guac and there was a ton of guac and it was so delicious. I had the tacos which were awesome and lots of flavor and also huge portions. My friend and I both had margaritas and loved them as well! Only issue is the wait is ridiculous and they don't take reservations...

Loved this place! Went last night with a friend and we will be back. The wine and the cheese fondue were delicious. Fondue took a little longer then expected but they had a new chef and we understand. They were very apologetic about it and handled It well.

I love YCs! Its build your own and I just don't understand how people blame ycs when THEIR MAKING THEIR OWN FOOD! Now with that said, I love the wheat noodles, the beef and chicken, and the mongolian sauce. The crispy chips are awesome on top of the bowl crumbled. It is a must to go..one because the foods good and two because its just a fun experience.

If I could give them zero stars I would.. I went in on 2 occasions and paid my 35 dollar copay up front and here I am 4 months later receiving a bills from collections! I called asking about it and they were like well oh well sorry we don't see that in our records! Are you serious? You sent it to collections when I paid each time I went!! I always pay my bills on time and thank you for your wonderful company to hurt my credit. Please whatever you do don't go here because one day you might get the same notice in the mail as i did.

Good hair cut but the people their act like their better then the rest of the universe. I dont appreciate going to places where I am paying good money to feel bad about the way I look. Way to pricey.85 dollars for a haircut! yeh right.

The dinner was so good!! Omg we died and went to heaven. It was my birthday and we wanted to try something different than our usually steakhouses which are also good but we were excited for this and we requested patio in advance. The patio was gorgeous!! Overlooks the mountains and has fire pits and all. it Made the dinner so much better just with the view. I had the 8oz filet, my dads gf got the salmon and the three men got the 12oz filet. Everyone was very impressed and said their meals were amazing. Sides mash potatoes, spinach, and mushrooms great choice.The service  was outstanding and they were very polite. Even though it was pricy it was worth it for a night out of great steak :) thank you j and g!

If I could give them no stars I would. I have had several bad experiences with them. 1. Went to Rome with my family. They let me on the plane phoenix to ohio fine but when it came time to go to rome they woudn't allow us on the plane. This was when the country just started using passports instead of birth certifigates but I was told a birth certifigate would be fine. So they decide not to tell us until Im STRANDED IN OHIO! We had to fly to atlanta to spend 1000 dollars on passports and by that time we missed out Cruise in Rome! 2. Decided to try them again. Stupid stupid..I was flying to Wisconsin from Philadelphia and needed to change my departure destination to San Diego. Okay, southwest would allow this. I even figured okay ill change the flight and just pay the difference. How about a change flight is 200 dollars! So I couldn't cancel it because I would lose 288 but if I changed it I would have 88 dollar credit! Are you people insane?! So I had no other option but to change it so I was on the phone and quoted 350 Additional. Dam you Delta. Fine, I told them I would call back in a minute just to confirm with a friend of mine who was flying with me. Called back it went up another 200 dollars! They don't be sorry but no can do! So I ended up paying almost 700 dollars for one coach seat. 3. Coming home from this trip they delayed my plane 4 times so I ended up waiting 4 1/2 hours in the airport. When I asked them what where they gonna do for me they gave me 7 dollar food voucher and said sorry. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? WILL NEVER EVER FLY WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN!! HORRIBLE DON'T DO IT!!!

I went last night with my boyfriend because we purchased a Groupon of Wine and Chocolate Pairing. When we first arrived it was a little strange it was in a little shopping center but once we entered we were pleasantly surprised. Its a quaint little wine cellar almost and everyone was very friendly. We tried 10 different wines and little chocolate wine tastings. All were good and it was overall a fun experience and we would do it again!

I was really excited to try this place...boy was I disappointed...we order chips and guac to start and they were nowhere to be found..I couldn't find my server so after 10 Minutes I got up to find her. I told her to cancel the chips because the food would be out any minute. Then they come out with the meal and the guac was brown and chips were stale. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it came out burnt bread and flavorless. I'm sorry i don't like to give restaurants a bad rep but it was a really bad experience

I love this place! Its my new favorite restaurant! Everything is so fresh and so good..I had the hummus to start with a friend and they had the burger which was awesome and I had the chicken sandwich which was pretty good. Sweet Potato Chips were amazing and the iced green tea was really good! Only downfall was the server could have been nicer but oh well maybe next time.

I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to stare at your "twin peaks" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking.
