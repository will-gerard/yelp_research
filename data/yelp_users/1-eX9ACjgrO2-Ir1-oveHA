Ordered delivery and waited 90 min only to receive the least appetizing Chinese food I've ever had.

I've had several cars worked on at Munich.  They explain everything to me without being condescending...like most mechanics do with women.  They've always been very ethical and have never tried to up-sell on a repair that didn't need to done.  I highly recommend them!
