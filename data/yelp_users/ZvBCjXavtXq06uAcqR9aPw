First of all. I have no qualms spending money on clothing...  I usually got to the Buckle in Scottsdale and at the Tempe Market Place where I've have raving reviews.  I was at this location since I was in the area.  I was very disappointed!    I immediately get there and she starts to sell me. No rapport whatsoever. First all of she asked "When you looking to upgrade?" Talking about my True Religion jeans. Woah.... I was offended. I was also wearing my Society Shirt and she already threw a purple long sleeve on at me.  At this point I let her know she crossed the line with the jeans comment. She then talked about her love of clothes and all. There was nobody in the store, she could have done a way better job.    I'll stick with my faithful Buckle in Scottsdale and Temple.  This Buckle can keep their lame customer service.

I love this location!  I've been to several Buckles in the valley and this one is the best by far.  I do appreciate a great salesperson and they do a great job.  If you like fashion, this place is a must.  Just let  them know your likes and what you love to wear and they'll get you some options.    They like to sell so they'll let you know you look great. I appreciate a honest person who says that looks terrible and will help you get a better fit.  This place does just that.    Get your punch card, they'll combine them if you forget.  They hem for free. They'll mail you out your purchase as well for an additional $5.
