I stayed in Scottsdale for two nights during a recent work trip. My company arranges our travel, so they chose the Scottsdale Hilton for me. I read Yelp reviews a few days before my trip and was a little concerned that I was going to be walking into smells or loud noises, as per other guest reviews, but my own experience was nothing like that.   The front desk concierge was extremely helpful upon checking me in, and even moved my room from a handicap accessible one (thanks, work) to one that was near the pool (at my request). They gave me a map of the resort, which was cute, and I then drove to my room (I didn't have to valet park, but when I pulled up to check-in, the valet was really nice and personable, which is always a plus).   The room was a typical hotel room, nothing out of the ordinary, but the bed was comfortable and everything was clean. The TV had very limited channels, and unfortunately a few of them didn't work, which was a bummer.   The pool was lovely, as was the pool bar Oasis. I ordered a margarita each time I visited the pool, though they seemed to be prepared differently depending on who was making them (one looked like lemonade and didn't taste like any liquor at all, the other was very strong). Relaxing by the pool was wonderful though, and some of the hotel staff came around with their strawberry infused water as well as Rice Krispie treats, which was a adorable (and the man who came out was SO sweet and attentive to all the guests, which was a huge plus).   All in all, I had a good experience at the Hilton and would definitely return. The room is typical and the TV was frustrating, but most likely if you're in Scottsdale, you're not there to spend a lot of time watching TV in your room. The staff was absolutely wonderful and more than made up for any slight problems, and the location of the hotel is also perfect, right on the main strip with so many restaurants and things to do within walking distance.

There's a learning curve to this place - for one, get there early, otherwise you will have to hover and then vulture down upon someone who is just leaving (I was not prepared for this during my first attempt of dining here, but came prepared - and at 4:30 pm - the following night and was able to score a seat outside on the patio). The patio tables are only four tops, which made me feel like a little bit of an ahole since I was in Scottsdale on a work trip and was here solo, but c'est la vie; it was gorgeous out and the outside space was perfect.   I arrived with plenty of time to enjoy happy hour, and decided on the green salad and grilled fish tacos to eat, as well as a glass (which quickly turned to two glasses - hello, I was eating alone) of the $5 happy hour Cabernet Sauvignon, which was delicious.   The salad with feta and candied walnuts ($6 for HH prices) arrived first and was delicious, followed by the grilled fish tacos ($10) that were some of the best I've ever had. I do wish I had the huckleberry margarita, as basically everyone around me ordered it and it looked AMAZING. Because I was there by myself and everyone probably assumed I was stood up on a Tinder date, I played into it by ordering the creme brulee for dessert, which had a perfect hard shell and was absolutely delicious (and well worth the four miles I had to run the next day to work it off).   The service was also good - my server was attentive (probably pitying the fact that I was eating there alone, so he was very quick to offer a second glass of wine and dessert menu), and to bring me the check at the end of my meal. For everything I ordered, because of the phenomenal happy hour prices, my bill was $36, with an $8 tip, I ate all of that for under $50 (not sure if I should be proud of that or not).   This will definitely be in my rotation for future business trips to Scottsdale, especially now that I know it does pay to get there early.

If I could give less than a star, I would. The United terminal at Phoenix airport is a disaster, and we were looking for somewhere to get a sit-down breakfast. Typically I look at Yelp reviews first, and I should have, because a grab and go muffin would have been better than this shitshow.  The service was the worst I have seen - the waitress who seemed highly angry with the fact that we came in to the restaurant literally slammed down menus, water glasses (mine had a bug in it), and the yogurt/bagel that we ordered out of fear (after reading Yelp reviews once seated) that the service would be so slow we'd miss our plane.  Everything seemed dirty, and the servers all seemed to have no concept of how to treat customers or take pride in anything they were doing.  This was the first time in my life that I was tempted to not leave any tip at all (my conscience got the best of me), but in hindsight, I shouldn't have. Avoid this at all costs and just grab a muffin from the Coffee Bean. Not worth the hassle, not worth feeling like you did something wrong by sitting down somewhere.  Absolutely the worst. The owner/management should really be ashamed.
