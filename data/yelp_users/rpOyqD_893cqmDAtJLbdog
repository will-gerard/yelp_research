You'll appreciate the decent food options, free WiFi, and ample seating before you pass through security (but alas, not so great after). The security line is hit or miss. Last time I got called out for hair product (Bumble and Bumble, I'm fancy yo!), but the gentleman was super nice about the whole thing and clearly felt bad throwing out my $20 worth of overpriced glue. PHX is typically busy, but not overwhelmed making it one of the more pleasant airports I frequent...

Like Geoff I needed a ride from PHX to Scottsdale. I didn't get Benny, but another Ridesmart affiliated driver. He showed up on time and his car was clean and comfortable. The driver's command of English was fairly rudimentary, but he was able to get by ok and got me to my destination smoothly. I was able to prepay for the ride, but had to use cash for gratuity.

I spent a few nights in their Tower Suites, both in a regular room and in a giant suite (friend's 30th). The newness of everything is definitely a plus and the views from the upper floors are killer. Rooms are appointed as you'd expect ... flat screens, stylish furnishings (though not over the top), nice showers (waterfall head in the big suite), soaking tubs, automated curtains, etc. I was a little bummed that there wasn't some sort of legit sound system in the large suite (only a little iPod dock).   Service wasn't as intense as it typically is in high-end hotels (Four Season, St. Regis, etc), but was decent. They do provide almost everything you'd want to do in Vegas (gambling, lounges/clubs, gym, restaurants, spas), amusingly I think we left the compound once in 48 hours.

Good stuff. Pricey by normal pizza standards.

Love their pizza. They used to have a great takeout special on Monday's, not sure if they are still doing it. Something like $6 for a large!

The gold standard for casinos everywhere. Just bring a fat wallet, you won't find many $5 tables here.

A surprisingly intimate restaurant in the Bellagio. Service was flawless and their food was quite good too, the real highlight of the meal was dessert. While I was only able to try their excellent chocolate souffl√©, the chocolate ball looked intense too. For the meal I started with the escargot and went with the butter poached lobster for my main. Both were solid four star dishes, but neither pushed my tastebuds to new heights. Overall a nice meal and a great "before the show" restaurant option, it's extremely close to the entrance to O -  Cirque du Soleil.

After dining at the restaurant we rolled back into the club (which weirdly you have to leave, re-pay, and come back in). The place was packed beyond the point of sensibility. A crowded club can be fun, but they stuff people in here like sardines. As a result there was really no place to dance comfortably, meeting people is near impossible, and the highlight was leaving. XS and Tryst in Encore and the Wynn are both prettier clubs and easier to navigate, I'd skip this one.

Not a good place for anything more than drinks. They have a very limited menu and were out of many of the items when we sat down. Those available were all small slider-like sandwiches which appeared preprepared (not made to order). It's an ok nook to grab a glass of wine, just don't drop in with high expectations. The waterfall and outdoor seating make it more distinct than other bar options nearby.

Price to performance is pretty stellar. For $110/night I enjoyed a large room with a luxurious bathroom, balcony, and cool retro furnishings. Service was decent, but the W Scottsdale is better on this front. Breakfast at their restaurant was basic but worked. Stylings from the lobby to the furniture in your room is really well done, the hotel has a great boutique-y vibe but without the pretentiousness. The location is good, only minutes from downtown Scottsdale. One snafu while I was there... I sent out some dry cleaning that was supposed to be back by 5:30pm, didn't happen. It was a stressful half hour before they found my stuff (all cleaned, phew!).

Three words... bone-in-filet or is that really two? I'll leave it to the more talented wordsmiths to do the math. Last Friday I had one of the better filets of my life. Cooked to medium-rare perfection you can't really get a better steak. Also watch out.. their pretzel bread is insanely addictive, just say no (actually say yes, eat a couple, then have them take the rest away). I'm a steak purist and it's worth noting they do add some butter to the steaks after they're cooked, if you're like me just ask to opt out.   Service was good, but know the ambiance is a little old school. The musical act in lounge reminded me of that two person band in the movie Swingers... cheesy, but you don't really hear it in the main dining room.

I'm not often a shoe shine guy, but when I'm in the airport I find it's a great way to kill time and add a little extra hop to your step. Last time I was in PHX I had the chance to meet Winkie. She did a fantastic job on my boots and was fun to chat with too. Goodfellows is an airport chain of sorts, I've used them in San Francisco as well. The shine guy in the new terminal at SFO definitely doesn't have Winkie's personality, so that plus a great shine earns her five stars!

My overall experience was good, however some elements weren't so hot...  Room:  Sucked. I stayed in what I believe was most modest accommodation they have (think they call it the "wonderful") and space-wise it was a little cramped. The bathroom wasn't "sufficiently separated" from the main room (I won't go into greater detail than that :). Also I'm not a TV person, but if I was I'd have been pissed off about where they placed the flatscreen. You can't watch TV comfortably from your bed (and it's not like there was any other place to relax in room).   Staff:  Fantastic. From the front desk people, to the concierge (Alyssa), to the waitresses in all of their bars and restaurants, everybody (and I do mean everybody) was really friendly and helpful. I've been to a lot of W Hotels that don't provide this level of service.  Entertainment:  Good. The pool is great during the day and at night turns into a decent hotspot. Not having to deal with the gianormous bouncer by flashing your room key is a nice perk. The location of the hotel is excellent, some of the bigger bars and clubs are a block away (and Scottsdale isn't known for it's walkability).   Final word:  Solid hotel for a bachelor party, guys weekend, etc. It's very much a scene and is clearly targeted at the 20s and 30s "out on the town" crowd. So if you're not looking for that type of scene, you'll probably want to pick something else.  Disclosure: My friend who works for Starwood got me a friends and family discount, I paid around $150/night.

The logo could use some work, but the interior is quite cool. Chairs are super comfy and the open layout allows you to survey the whole place. My steak was excellent (took a respite from my mostly veggie ways) and everyone in our group was similarly pleased with their meal. Service was great too. It's a bit hushed inside, so probably not the best if you've got a really rowdy group, but we were on good behavior ;).

Stayed here a little while ago for a night. Booked a regular room (~$250/night) but was offered an upgrade for $100. The room I got for the extra hundo was truly massive, so big it didn't have a number... but a name! The staff was excellent and the cab I had scheduled was waiting for me as I checked out. Definitely a comfortable and very central place to stay if you're ever in Pittsburgh.

Really amazing fish entrees, and the fish tour was a nice touch (ask for it!). I also thought the lamb chops and grilled octopus were delicious too. Our group was on a bit of a tight schedule and the staff was in tune with that (though due to timing of our entrees we were eating right down to the wire). Only complaint was the restaurant was filled with light smoke by the end of our dinner, not sure the root cause but hopefully that's not a regular occurrence.

Hipster-y coffee in Old Town. You know I like me some tasty cappuccinos, but for some reason they wouldn't do a cappuccino to-go, that was a first... so I went with a latte. Fortunately the latte was excellent so I have no trouble forgiving them for a little coffee snobbery.

Small store with lots of vintage guitars and a few new ones at a variety of price points. We came in to do some tire kicking and the owner introduced himself and let us pluck away. I didn't end up buying anything, but appreciated the owners attention when we needed or wanted it, a useful guitar resource for the neighborhood.
