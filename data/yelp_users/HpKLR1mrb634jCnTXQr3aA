Two words that you'd never expect in the same sentence.  However that is what await you at Kai.  Native American And French cuisine, two cultures you don't expect together, but the chef at Kai blends these two types of cuisine beautifully.  Located in the dazzling Wild Horse Pass, this is a perfect blend of Native American and French cuisine.   The 7 course meal called the "short story" started with a duck confetti on top of a reduced raspberry for the amuse.  Next came a local heirloom ripened tomato tart.  Thirdly was the freshly fileted Spanish sea bass.  The skin side was slightly seared so it was crispy.  The sauce was a mixture of lemon and orange extract on a bed of vegetables.   I'm a big fan of white fish, but the bass here I found to be a bit overcooked.  The usual flaky meat ofa white sea fish wasn't very pronounced in this dish.   Following the intermezzo which was very forgettable (because I forgot) was their signature dish, an exquisite grilled buffalo tenderloin.    The buffalo sat on top of a corn puree and beans syrup sauce.   The texture and tenderness matched some of the best filet mignon I've ever had coupled with a gaming flavor.  Before the dessert was a cheese sampler.   They paired it with a fresh honey jam.  The just right amount of sweetness of the honey complimented the fine selection of cheese.   The dessert was a cheesecake which seemed common, however the complimentary chocolate dessert was delectable.      Even though the sea bass could've been better (but then again I do have high expectations :-), this place still deserves a 5 start for its amazing atmosphere and impeccable service.   Where else would they let you choose 4 different types of fruits to put in your water.  :-)  Even the menu has a southwestern painting  in the front.

I've been to this place a couple of times, mainly for team lunches, so I thought I'd review it this time.  When you walk in, you get that classy Asian vibe.   It's fairly upscale looking.  But the first thing I noticed was how few Chinese people there are.  I think I was the only one.    We had the chicken lettuce wrap for the appetizer. The chicken was not as tender as some other lettuce wraps I've had, and the soysauce may have overpowered the taste of the chicken.  But it was edible.  I tried one of the lunch bowls: pepper steak.  It said it should by spicy, but I couldn't feel the spice.  The beef was cooked well, but they ODed on the sauce making it too salty.    I thought the dessert shooters were really cute.  It's a good portion for those who want to have some desserts but not overstuff ourselves after a heavy main course.  The tiramisu shooter isn't as good.  But then it's not expected to have a tiramisu flavor in a Chinese oriented place.  It tastes more like a tiramisu cake instead of the traditional soft and creamy tiramisu I'm used to at an Italian restaurant.  What I do like about the restaurant is the different tea flavors you can choose from.  And they bring it out for you in a traditional Chinese/Japanese like teapot to set the Asian mood.  It's a good alternative for a tea house.   Pf Chang's is good to have food for the people who like the Chinese-American fusion.  It may be a good place to start if you're scared of "real" Chinese food.  It's not a good place for authentic Chinese food.  And the price is more than I would pay for average tasting lunch.

Gilbert is an up and coming suburb with new buildings and neighbors.  However when you go to old town Gilbert to eat at Liberty Market, you find yourself transported to the "olden days."  The area gives you a feel of what Gilbert was like decades ago.  Liberty Market provides fresh ingredients obtained from local markets.  I was told that they even have a garden of produce for their meals.   Below are some of the great dishes I've had the restaurant.  Salmon BLT What a great twist on a classic sandwich.  I'm usually not a big fan of salmon, mainly because if cooked wrong, it can taste bland and dry.  However this grilled salmon was flaky, soft, moist, and melted in my mouth.  All the ingredients complemented each other and my taste buds were happy.     Caprese Salad Who knew a simple salad could taste so good.  Caprese is simply just mixed green, mozzarella, and tomatoes.   The large chunks of tomatoes and mozzarella gave a wonderful presentation to the platter.  The main thing I thought that set this salad apart was their balsamic vinaigrette.   The sweetness of the vinaigrette contrasted with the tangy tomatoes.  It's sweeter than the normal balsamic vinaigrette and a bit thicker than what I'm used to.  However that's the beauty of it.  Bread Pudding This tastes essentially like a moist cake with real whipped cream.  A great dessert should satisfy my sweet tooth, but not so sweet that I can't take more than a few bites.  And this bread pudding gives me that please.  Great for a snack or to cap off a great meal to tend to your sweet tooth.     Great food, interesting ambience, and be a part of the "eat local" crowd with Liberty Market.  Don't forget to try their variety of coffee selection.   A great place to come back to again and again.

Who knew in midst all of the Mexican restaurants, you'd find a diamond in the rough for Chinese food.  Arizona doesn't have many Chinese restaurants to begin with, however this place rivals the places in CA.  It's not the place for ambience or mood, but the food is the most important for the Chinese and this place is great for dinner or dim sum.     Notes for ordering dishes: I loved the garlic pea sprouts/shoots.  Not all Chinese restaurants this vegetable, but this place makes have it fresh and crunchy and just enough garlic flavor to give it that extra pizzazz.  What I noticed is that this place serves unique fried noodles.  Perfect for vegetarians, this place actually cooked crispy fried noodles unlike most other Chinese restaurant that just comes out with soggy noodles.  Another dish I recommend is their spiced salt tofu. (jiao yan tofu).  Well anything with the spiced salt (jiao yan).  They deep fry the small pieces of tofu or whatever other "jiao yan" producing a crunchy crust and mix it with a salty seasoning and jalapenos.  Great for an appetizer!  My family and I also had their steamed whole fish.  Light flavor and prepared beautifully with the entire moist fish out on the table.  Just the sauce and rice alone tastes just as good.  Be sure to try their walnut shrimp.  Be sure you have a big mouth to fit one of these jumbo shrimp in one bite.  The sauce covering the shrimp has just the right amount of tanginess and sweetness that I'm looking for without being too thick.  And the sweet crunchy walnut complements the dish as well. Ordering the right dishes can make or break your experiences.  For this restaurant, be sure to pick seafood, their specialty.  They have live fish, crabs, etc in clear tanks so you can pick out your dinner victim.  And of course pick fried anything, especially with their spiced salt (jiao yan).  Notes for dim sum: Great Wall actually has a unique set of dim sum choices that you can't find anywhere in the valley (at least the Chinese dim sum places I've been to).  Although it's a bit more expensive than the other places in the valley I've been to, but it does taste better overall.  Even the basic dim sum dishes like shrimp dumplings, shumai, and chicken feet simply taste better and I would even say taste better than some CA restaurant.  Who'd thought?  Because the dishes are small, you can try many of them and of course I would go for the fried stuff.  :-) However be careful.  Keep your eye out for the moving carts, if what you want has been sitting there for a while, wait for a new batch.  Cold Chinese food just doesn't taste as well.  Only the tin dishes that are covered are fine, because their still hot after the servers make their rounds.  Go on the weekend for a wider selection and be prepared to have a wait.  But the wait isn't that bad compared to some places I've been to in CA.  Great to go with a medium sized party so you can taste more variety, but not have to wait a long time for a table.  Overall, this is a great place to get great Chinese food if you live in the valley and don't want to make a 6hr journey to LA just for good Chinese food (which I have done before).

This is your traditional Korean restaurant.  But what separates this place is that it has an extensive list of sushi options.  I'm going to focus on their primary repertoire, Korean food.  Starting off with their seafood tofu soup.  It was filled with many varieties of seafood, from clams, oysters, and baby octopus.  All the flavors of the seafood has been extracted into the soup because biting into the actual seafood themselves, it tasted very bland.  The tofu was soft which melted in my mouth.  This subtle tofu taste and texture complemented well with the heavy taste of the broth.. Up next was their signature dish.  It's a kalbi, cut in Korean style which is vertical on the bone instead of like the horizontal American cut.  The cut of the meat was thicker than the usual kalbi cut.  The meat had more flavor than other Korean restaurant I've tasted thanks to the fat.  However, it was a bit tougher than usual.  I loved chewing on the fat that was connected to the bone itself.  But it was tough to chew and swallow.  Therefore I just chewed it like a gum to suck the flavor.    I would come back mainly for the soup.  The dishes were wonderful and eating rice helped to balance strong flavors.  If you like strong flavors, then these dishes would be perfect for you.

I had a great time at the culinary festival and it was a nice and sunny Sunday afternoon to be there.  But the first thing I thought of when  I arrived is what us Chinese would say "People mountain.  People sea."  OMG.   There are a lot of people.  It was like Disneyland over the winter holidays.  I feel like I had to walk over people just to get through.  I bought the all access pass.  I think this is great for the first timers because it gets access to the Great Arizona Picnic, Skyy Bar, Patron Experience, festival of beers, Robert Mondavi wine tour, and Cooks & Corks.  Cooks & Corks is the main event of the day, and the other places only give you admission into the place.  All the tastings still cost money, which I personally think that'll be a lot if you want to try everything.   Every vendor in the Great Arizona Picnic brings their stuff for you to try, but it's pretty expensive.  The best part is of course Cooks & Corks because you get to taste all the vendors' food and a bunch of varieties of wine.  There are also the cooking classes and an alcohol seminar.  The cooking demos weren't that impressive.   But there was Wilo Benet from Top Chef if you've watched that show.   With so many wine vendors there, you're sure to get drunk.  I didn't even get to try everything, because I was getting drunk after a while.  They also pour you a lot in your cup for sampling.   I came hungry, but walked extremely full.  The 4 hour event went by fast.  Now onto my favorites of the events.  My favorite vendor would have to be the guys from Yellowtail at the Bellagio.  I'll give them props driving all the way from Vegas to showcase their food.  Their kobe beef tataki was to die for.  I went through the lines multiple times so to eat more of it.  They were also the first vendors to close shop because they ran out of food before the end of the event.  The sauce was subtle in taste and spicy and complimented beautifully with the beef.  And their green garnishes added a splash of color to the small dish.  Light and tender, the kobe beef melted in my mouth.    The other thing I loved about the event is the muddling seminar by Kim Haasarud, writer of 101 mojitos.  In the class, she taught us how to make  3 different types of mojitos and even invited the audience for demonstration.  The best part is getting the samples for the 3 cocktails.  These "samples" were 3 full glasses of cocktails.  My favorite was the blood orange mojito.  Light and fruity for those who don't like a strong rum taste.  And it's a peachy color suitable for my girly tastes.  A lot of people walked out of the class with lost red faces and lost inhibitions.    The Cooks & Corks is definitely worth the price and it was a great experience.  I give it a 5 stars just because of this event. The only bad part it was too short.  This event made the culinary festival worth the time.  The other stuff I saw outside of that building wasn't that impressive.  I think next year, I'll just go to the Cooks & Corks event and maybe try another special event, the all access is fun just to see if you haven't been to the special areas, but it's probably not worth the extra few bucks.  I did like the small beer mug as a souvenir though from the beer festival. :-)

Roaring Fork offers a more rustic feel for the bold American cuisine.  The dim lights created a warm and inviting atmosphere to the cool evening.  But there was still enough light to view the food that I was served.  I opted for Frying Pan River Rainbow Trout.  The trout is sautéed with roasted almonds, capers and brown butter creating a delectable combination for the palate.   The fish was flakey that melted in my mouth.  The slight crust on top created a wonderful contrast to the soft fish.  A squeeze of lemon actually added to the flavor as well to the saltiness of the fish.  The taste was light yet strong as the same time.  The almonds added to the crunchy taste like the crust on top of the fish.  Along with the fish was a piece of cornbread made with real corn.  I could taste the corn chucks in the bread.  It had a slight sweet taste to contrast the fish's flavors.  But it didn't overpower the fish.  The whole dish had so many textures and flavors that made me jump with delight.  My tummy was happy.   Of all the great things I have to say about the dish, I would still say that it lacked "specialness" to it that would make the dish and the restaurant shine and stand out from the others.

Walking into the restaurant doesn't even seem like going to a Thai restaurant.  The servers were Caucasian.  In the middle of Old Scottsdale, it has a ritzy feel to it.  It has more of a contemporary Thai-American fusion atmosphere.   The price is a bit hefty for a Thai restaurant.  It reminds me of PF Chang for Chinese food.  We had the soft shell crab for the appetizer and the duck curry and the coco chili fish for the main course.  The soft shell crab is made from a whole soft shell crab including the shell attached and tempera battered which made the crab very crunchy.  Every part of the crab was edible.  The mixture of the crunchy tempera batter and the sweet tangy cucumber mae ploy sauce was delectable.  The duck from the duck curry dish was so tender that it tasted like butter. The red curry had pineapple in it. I ordered a 4 for the duck curry, but it wasn't as spicy as some of the other Thai places were.  So if you like HOT food, then be sure to ask for 5+.  The coco chili fish is a battered white fish deep fried covered in a peanut sauce.  It was one of their signature dishes.  I enjoyed the flavoring of the fish.  The batter absorbed the sauce very well that created a unique combination.  It went quite well together.    I recommend this place with a love for Thai food and an openness to trying new things.

The Elements restaurant at Sanctuary is truly a sanctuary place to be in, tucked away in a quiet resort with a great view of Camelback mountain.  Classy, elegant, and modern, it's has a romantic atmosphere and great for a date.  They even had a live band  the night we were there creating a cozy atmosphere.      The appetizer course that we shared was a duck and foie gras shumai.  Talk about fusion food: Chinese and French blend.  An odd combination, but surprisingly palatable.   The grilled foie gras on top tasted like a moist steak.  The duck confetti filling paired well with the strong flavor of the foie gras.  The teriyaki sauce added another Asian touch.   On to the main course: plancha grilled halibut and a mustard crusted Colorado rack of lamb.   The halibut was simply just ok, nothing too special.  The skin was crispy, but the fish was a bit dry.  I was wanting a citric taste from the lemon shellfish broth, but it didn't add too much flavor to the dish.   The medium rare rack of lamb store the show that night.  Tender and juicy at the same time, I found my euphoria.  The taste was strong, but not overpowering that I can still taste the tender texture of the lamb.   Definitely order medium rare to achieve this masterpiece in your mouth.  You won't regret it!  As always, another chocolate dessert for this chocoholic.  The PB bomb: I just had to order because of the creative name.  Wonderfully present, this dessert was basically a very rich and fancy Reese's peanut butter cup.   Heaven in my mouth for sure.      Another thing to look for at Elements is the bar at happy hour.  It had a relaxing atmosphere, something you wouldn't see in the trendy Scottsdale location.  The food selection isn't that wide or even that great, however the alcohol is high quality at a low price.  They had fresh ingredients and high-end liquor.  It was also fun sitting at the bar watching the bartender make my drink.    I still gave it a 5 stars even with the so-so fish, but everything else that I experienced made it wonderful in my book.  But I gotta hand it to Elements for making the place so irresistible.  This is a place for foodies to come and retreat for a relaxing evening of good food and good music.

House of Tricks is located near ASU, surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the college town and the famous Mill Ave. You'd never expect to find a quaint and classy restaurant in the midst of crazy college life.  It has a garden-like patio space which also houses a fire place to keep its guests warm during some of the chilly Arizona nights.  The restaurant serves a mixture of Euro and Asian cuisine with obvious French preparation techniques.  With all the influence, I guess that's why it's labeled "American", because it's a melting pot.   The menu changes every season based on availability of fresh ingredients.  Supplement your meal with a wide selection of wine.   During our visit in the summer, they had an Ahi-Tuna, its wrapped in bacon and dressed in a miso based glazed. This probability will raise some eyebrows at first, until that first bite. The combination works really well.  The tender texture of the Ahi-Tuna complimented the smoky and salty flavor of the bacon.  The miso horseradish glazes is just what the dished needed to bring the flavors together.   Also on the summer menu was the tenderloin, cooked medium rare with a bacon-fig gastrique. The steak was cooked spot on. The bacon-fig gastrique was just a perfect balance of sweet and sour taste, complementing the meat.   All of the ingredient was fresh; the servers are friendly and for the most part knowledgeable of the food.  The price is on the higher side with an average entre costing over $30. However they do serve an amazing lunch menu at a very reasonable price, a perfect spot to enjoy lunch and the AZ sun under the garden patio.  Come out the quaint French influence restaurant and try all their seasonal dishes, you won't be disappointed.  I went back a few times afterwards and was able to get great results.

Their quote on the menu is "it is easier for a French chef with a knife and an open fire to create a culinary masterpiece than it is for them to produce a perfect hamburger." by Louis Szathmary.  This is the place where I come for burgers & martinis.   First off, I love the modern decor of the restaurant.  Glass is everywhere and everything looks chic and clean.  The building itself is art.  Which fits in really well consideration they are next to the Scottsdale center of performing arts.  It's a cultural center for modern art and food.  Their martinis are really unique.  They fill the cocktail to the brim and have some some unique concoctions.  Worth the try.    Onto the made to order burgers.  Juicy as can be.  If you love bacon, try the burger au poivre 2 & burger las brisas gives you a southwestern flair.   Or stick with the original burger or cheeseburger. Their waffle fries are great as well.  No matter which burger you choose, you're in for a treat and be prepared to be stuffed afterwards.    I would stay away from the chicken sanwiches as the one I tried was a bit dry.  The have gluten free options & the kitchen is open until 12:30am, which is awesome if you want a late night meal.

Le Cirque is situated in Bellagio with an excellent view of the famous water fountain.  The restaurant is small, but every aspect of it makes it high class and sophisticated.  Even the servers wear suits and wait on you hand and foot.  When I got up in the middle of the meal, someone automatically directed me towards the restroom without having me ask.  Walking in the restaurant gives you a circus feel.  The colorful fabric on the walls and circus murals create a fun and entertaining ambiance.  The cute monkey plates they give you added a nice touch as well.   So many starter breads to start out with.  Le Cirque never leaves out the details.  Even the butter had a cute design with "Le Cirque" stamped on it.  We opted for the 3 course meal.  They start you off with an amuse bouche which consisted of a puffed cheese pastry and some creamy soup.  The pastry was fluffy and buttery.  The soup which tasted like some sort of chowder was a great start to the meal.    For the appetizer, we had the lobster salad and foie gras au torchon.  The lobster salad consisted of a fresh whole lobster tail with house dressing.  The small citric taste of the dressing helped to balance the refreshing greens of the dish.  The foie gras was not the greatest I've had.  It had a stronger taste which didn't balance well with the sweetness of the strawberry compote.  It wasn't as smooth and creamy as some other foie gras I've had.  We had a blanquette de lapin (rabbit) and chilean sea bass for the main course.  Both came highly recommended by the staff.  The rabbit was tender and full of flavor.  The presentation was unique.  The foamed sauce surrounded the rabbit and ravioli.  The sea bass was the best part of the meal.  The best way to describe it was AMAZING!!.  The meat was flaky, but not too bouncy.  Each of the threads of the fish could be separated as it melted in my mouth.  It was accompanied by two citric vinaigrette reductions: orange and lemon, which added a sweet and tangy taste to the fish.  This is a definite must-try for any fish or simply food lover without a deathly allergy reaction to fish.  The meal ended on a sweet sensation.  We had a chocolate sphere and chocolate soufflé.  The sphere reminded me of a giant Rocher chocolate .  It comes with a warm chocolate that was poured over the sphere and opened it revealing the rich milk chocolate in the center.  It was a great show. There was even an edible gold foil on top.  This dessert was just chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate!  Great for the chocolate lover like myself.  The warm cream poured on the soufflé created a nice contrast to the cold vanilla bean ice cream.  Another must for the chocolate lover.  The portions at first seemed small, but with the added bonuses, I was really full at the end.  After a delectable meal, go see the awesome Cirque du Soleil show: O, which is just next door.  Come here to get a taste of high class Vegas!  This restaurant which with a Michelin star is rightfully earned.

After a long day of shopping in Scottsdale fashion we decided to try out some new restaurant nearby and eventually settled on Wildfish. I have heard some good things about this place before, and for most part, the praises were well deserved.  As we walked to our seats, I took notice to the dim light which sets a very nice and intimate ambiance.  However the dim lights weren't good to take pictures of the food.  We first ordered a yellowtail sashimi to share; it came with a light soy glaze with piece of jalapeno on top. A little strange and not all that memorable, but the fish was fresh and enjoyable. For our entrée we ordered an Ahi tuna steak over sautéed shitake mushroom accompanied with a wasabi potato puree. The tuna was a very thick cut, and it felt eating a tender steak. The top and bottom was seared and I loved the slightly charred taste. The center was kept raw but slightly warm. The tuna was very fresh; the sweetness of the puree complemented the fish well adding additional flavor to an already gorgeous fish.  Our second dish is a Chilean sea bass cooked Hong Kong style. Being a big fan of Chilean sea bass, it's very rare to find restaurant that still serve this fish being it is considered to be endangered. The fish, with its flaky texture, is soft because of the fat.  This gives it a lot of flavor.  I really like their Hong Kong style preparation method. They simply steamed the fish over a batch of tender spinach supplemented with a light soy sauce mixture. For $38 it is a very good deal considering typical Chilean sea bass dishes are very expensive.  I think this will be my new spot if I ever get the craving for good seafood.

Conveniently located near the Scottsdale Fashon, this place is great for a nice lunch before you shop 'til you drop. The restaurant doubles as a marketplace, so you can buy some goods while you're there too.  The decor is clean and fresh and simply done.    Now on to the food.  The one thing to describe their food (at least the two dishes I tried there) is lots and lots of oil.  Maybe that's why it tasted so good.  The Funghi Trifolati flatbread was recommended.  The mushroom and arugula is a wonderful pairing for the simple dish.  The tallegio cheese stretches beautiful when I took a bite.  The only thing I wished was that the thin bread was more crispy.  It was too soft for my taste.  And of course they drenched it with olive oil.    The mushroom tortelli ordered was a light classic dish that was cooked wonderfully as well.  I preferred this dish over the flatbread.  The ravioli was cooked a bit adante which was great, and the flavors blended well with the mushroom.  What I remembered of the sauce was that it was light and drenched in oil again.  See the trend? :-)  But   Overall, I would give a thumbs up for Olive & Ivy.  Happy eating in 2013!

Who knew in the midst of Viva Las  Vegas strip, you'd find a Korean BBQ restaurant.  But not just that, but a very packed and delicious Korean BBQ.  Note for those who want to try this place, be prepared for a long wait at least for dinner when we went there. When you walk into a Korean restaurant and most of the customers are Korean, you know you're in the right place for some authentic cuisine.    The two dishes that stood out for me were 2 pork dishes.  The first pork dish was mixed with rice cake and cabbage and was stewed in a kimchi sauce.  The tender pork had a kick to it, but also sweet at the same time.  Very traditional Korean food. I was hesitate to try dishes mixed with kimchi, but this was surprisingly good.  The second pork dish was spicy and grilled with onions. The sauce was more spicy than the first.  It was a simple combination, but great.  Both dishes were similar, however I didn't' mind eating it twice.    I've had some really great seafood tofu soup and this place was definitely on par.  The soup wasn't watered down and had a strong flavor. And they didn't put too much vegetables overpowered the seafood flavor.    Though i would say this place is a bit more expensive then the ones I've been to at home, but it's Vegas. Overall, I would say that this place would be a great pit stop on my next Vegas trip.  Another great thing is that this place is 24hr, so you can come visit here after a long night of Vegas fun! :-)

Situated next the Scottsdale Fashion Square, you'd expect it would be a classy ritzy place.  And indeed it is.  It's dark ambiance creates a romantic atmosphere great for a date or just a fancy night out with friends.  Though I would say they could've had a brighter candle just so I can get a better look at the great tasting food.  Sure enough I was served with a great bone-in filet, creamed spinach, and an awesome butter cake.  The steak had the bone in which created a succulent flavor.  It was also covered in butter before cooked in very hot temperature which helped to seal in the moisture making the steak very juicy.  The large plate was coated with butter and parsley and probably baked.  As warned by the server, "don't the plate."  It actually sizzled when it was brought out.  The medium rare steak was cooked perfectly.  So moist that it tasted more like butter.  I could almost cut like it was fish.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  Adding any sort of sauce would have hid the wonderful taste of the steak.  It was also the thickest piece of meat I'd ever seen.  It's rare that I can find a thick steak that's cooked well.  The creamy spinach was also wonderful.  It was a light cream mixed with the spinach that actually complimented the steak.    I'm usually a chocolate person, but I thought I'd try their signature butter cake this time.  Once you get the cake, start from the center and work your way out.  The moist and fluffy center mixed with the vanilla gelato was superb.  The real heavy whipped cream added to the flavor as well.  The cake was caramelized on top created a crunchy contrast.    All three dishes were signature dishes of the restaurant.  It's no wonder why they are the signature dishes.  You may also try their signature cream corn which I will try the next time.  It may be pricey for some, but well worth its price.  And hey.  It's good to splurge once in a while. :-)

Downtown Chandler is a great place to find local shops and boutiques.  One of which is the Urban Tea Loft.  They have an extensive tea collection for you to chose from.  Be sure to check-in from Yelp to receive your free glass of wine.  The first thing i noticed that this restaurant is hip and forward-thinking using an iPod Touch to take orders and an iPad for your bill at the end.  It's a small restaurant, so if you're here at a busy time, you'll have to wait a bit longer.  Now onto the food.  My meal was simple, but excellent.  I never thought that I grilled veggie sandwich and tomato basil soup could taste so well.  The soup was extremely creamy.  And they added more cream than most places.  It actually works well because there's less of the tangy tomato taste.  The added basil garnish is a nice touch.  The grilled veggie panini had fresh vegetables with seasoned goat cheese and house made pesto sauce.  It was a creative combination to jazz up a plain panini.    Simple creative fresh food that utilizes technology to the fullest.  That sums up Urban Tea Loft.  Be sure to check out this cute restaurant in the heart of Chandler.

If you want to try some sushi that's prepared with a delightful spin then this place is perfect for you. The atmosphere resembles a club more than a high class restaurant.  It's filled with fast-paced dance music and most of the guests are dressed like they are ready for the club after dinner.   The defining feature of the restaurant comes from its mixture of Japanese and Brazilian cuisine. Our server recommended the seviches and tiraditos; since we couldn't decide which one to get we ordered both! Seviches are sashimi served in a fruit/salsa. We had tiger shrimp in a mango salsa and tuna with grapefruit and jalapenos. The sashimi was super fresh and I loved the fruit/salsa combo.  It was sweet and refreshing. Tiraditos are sashimi immersed in a tangy sauce, probability the only dish I wasn't too fond of though.  The sauce was too sour and it overwhelmed the fish.   If eating an endangered animal does not affect your conscience I would highly recommend the Chilean sea bass skewers. The fish was amazing, the meat practically flakes off on its own and the unagi sauce was so Umami!   I saved the best for last. imagine eating all of the finest food: foie gras, caviar and gold?!?! all in one bite. Hurry to Sushisamba and order the Yamato roll.  At first the combination of those above ingredient wrapped in a tuna roll may seem excessive, but it absolutely worked.  It is the best roll I ever had.  The caviar and gold were subtle, but the foie gras, infused its smoky buttery flavor to an otherwise ordinary but fresh tuna roll, made it special. I would like to add, the foie gras was one of the finest I have ever eaten and it came from a SUSHI restaurant.  Try Sushisamba if you are in Vegas to get a delectable and unique sushi experience.

After eating here so many times, I thought I'd finally do a review on it.  The first thing you notice when you walk in Blue Wasabi is: this place is hip and cool.  With its contemporary design and chic atmosphere, you know this is the place to be on a Friday night.  And the blue chairs and other blue accessories keeps with the theme.  The best part about this place is that there's Happy Hour (HH) everyday and I would only come here when it's HH.  Half off on certain drinks, rolls and sushi, it's no wonder it'll get crowded during the HH time.    What's this place know for is their blue wasabi just like the name of the restaurant.  It takes just like regular wasabi but colored blue which makes this different.  After trying pretty much all their HH menu, I would have to say my favorites are Killer Bee and the seared Ahi tuna salad dishes.  Killer Bee is great for those who love unagi.  The eels are so fresh and very tasty.  The subtle sweet taste of the sauce and the mango is sure to sting your taste buds.  This is a great twist from the traditional California roll.  What I love about the tuna salad is its many fresh tuna.  They are very generous on the tuna.  And the tangy vinaigrette adds a nice kick to the dish.   The salad is great for sharing, but it can be a pretty good meal by itself.  The desserts are a twist to the traditional main course.  They don't have your simple green tea ice cream or other Japanese desserts.  But they replace it w/ sweet chocolate rolls, banana spring rolls and tempera apples.    On top of it all, they have creative names for their rolls that make this sushi place unlike the other sushi places you've ever been.  Its unique flavors and clever food twists make this place makes you want to eat and play with your food. Good eats + good fun = successful restaurant.

I heard a lot of praise for this place from my co-worker, so I decided to give it a try. Definitely a nice place but for the price I was expecting it to blow my mind. And I was not blown away. The ambiance was good, low lights with a very nice wine selection. The servers were all very knowledgeable with the menu, which was important since the restaurant changes its menu every season to ensure its ingredients are fresh.  When the sever was explaining the menu, he recommended us to each order 1 dish from the appetizer, one from the salad and one from the entrée.  I found that to be excessive.  So with the server's recommendation I ordered a pan seared foie gras which came with braised short rib in a onion consommé. The foie gras was chilled and very creamy with a hint of sweetness, one of the best I had. The accompanied short rib and consommé was delicious and quite filling as well.  For the entrée, I ordered the duck fat poached Wagyu strip loin.  Wagyu is the American version of the Japanese Kobe.  As expected the steak was very tender, however I was expecting a little more fat and flavor like the Kobe.   My date first ordered a beef tartare with seared scallops, the tartare was very soft and the fattiness of the beef made it very savory.  Scallop was chilled after it was seared, which made it rubbery but I really like the blend of the innate saltiness from the sea water with the sweetness of the meat. The second dish is a Bouillabaisse, which was a combination of various seafood such as lobster, scallop, mussels, and crab stewed in a tomato broth.  The content of the soup was superb, but everything was overpowered by the strong flavor of the tomato sauce. It was a little disappointing.   By the time we made it to the dessert, we were stuffed.  The server's portion recommendation was completely off.  But we had to satisfy our sweet tooth. According to the sever, they had the top 3 banana crème pie in the state. So of course we had to put that to the test. The pie was very good, the banana mouse filling was not too sweet and whipped to a smooth texture.  However the pie was topped with a thick layer of melted marshmallows, which was extremely sweet.  That almost ruined the dessert, but having a little bit with the dessert adds a nice sweetness to the overall flavor.    This place is probably worth a 3.5 stars only because it's I don't think it's worth the price for the food I received.  But it's a restaurant worth trying.

Walking into Posh, I felt a modern appeal.  Its decor screamed  classy and sophistication. What's interesting about the place is that there is no real menu.  You pick the ingredients you cannot eat, and the chef makes whatever his imagination takes him.  Of course, I wanted to see what the chef can create, so I wrote that I can eat anything and everything, including the fois gras.  The foie gras add-on for $15 is a must.  We opened with an amuse bouche:  a melon caviar My first dish were legumes with a light vinaigrette sauce punctuated with edible rose petals.  It was a mediocre opening.  The next course was fantastic.  It was a braised octopus in a mushroom puree.  The saltiness was perfect.  It accentuated the natural flavor of the octopus exquisitely.   The next course was a smoked bass in a soy-based sauce.  The fish had good texture.  But the overall taste was bland.  Up next was the most amazing dish of the entire meal: the fois gras.  I've had foie gras many times, but by far, this is the best I've ever had.  It was caramelized on both side which contracted to the heaviness of the foie gras.  It's paired with the melon caviar and a sweet and tangy dried plum jam which balanced the foie gras.  It was a definite must-have. Up next, was the braised rabbit in a vegetable stock.  The rabbit was tender and flavorful.  An average dish. The fourth course was a bison medallion in a mushroom broth.  The meat was cooked medium rare.  I'm not a big fan of the bison because the meat is typically tougher, but the favoring and broth was good regardless. The next course was a filet mignon medallion in a red wine reduction.  The meat was tender again.  All props to the chef.  All the meat was medium-rare as ordered.  The broth was not overpowering so you can enjoy the full flavor of the beef.   Up next was a surprise.  Courtesy of the chef, a cheese sample.  Which I love love love!  And finally the last of our journey, the dessert.  :-(   What I had was every girl's dream: the splendid chocolate soufflé.  It was heaven on earth.  It was fluffy and the sweetness was just the right amount.  I could die right there. :-)  Overall, the dinner was very good.  Some of the dishes especially the foie gras was definitely worth revisiting.  I would highly recommend all those with a fat wallet to come and experience the uniqueness of Posh.

Cornish Pasty has a very strong English pub atmosphere, accentuated by its industrial stools and wooden benches.  The best way to describe a pasty is a gourmet hot pocket.   The fillings come in all types from traditional lamb and mint to the southwestern influence of chiptole chicken.  I had the lamb and mint pasty, comprised of chunky pieces of lamb, carrots, and potatoes, with the aroma of fresh mint.  This is their specialty.  Another one I tried was their Shepard's pie.  This is a traditional Shepard's pie incased in a flaky crust.  The filling is minced lamb meat with herbs and spices mixed with mashed potatoes.  Each individual ingredient didn't seem all that special, but mixed together, it created a masterpiece in my mouth.  The flavors blended well together.  I also ordered their "chips" (french fries for us Americans).  They cut baked potato wedges which are great for the health-conscience people.  It's seasoned with sautéed garlic and parmesan cheese.  The seasoning wasn't too stron.g  It gave the potato a subtle garlic flavor unlike some other restaurant which over-season their fries.    Come to this bloody good restaurant to experience a casual British pub without the price of a plane ticket.

Shakes, shakes, everywhere.  If you want a great shake and lots of choices this is a great place for you.   This is a great family-oriented place and what I saw when I first walk in:  lots of children.  You travel back in time to a 1950s diner with nickel jukeboxes and waiters with the funny paper hats.  Burgers, fries, and shakes for the typical American meal.  The waiters may even put on a show and dance to one of the songs you choose from their jukeboxes.  For the first time, I thought I'd try "The Original."  This burger is some greasy goodness.   The burger is so juicy and tender and I inhaled it so quickly.  The fresh vegetables make this burger a classic.  I think one of the reasons it tasted so well was all the grease.  Fat and grease may be bad for you, but it just tastes so great.      There's a huge selection of shakes for whatever you're in the mood for.  When you get the chance, try them all!  I tried the original strawberry shake.  When it arrived, it came in a cool mug, and another cup of the extra.  It's big enough to share.  The real whipped cream was thick.  The ice cream was so rich, smooth, and thick.  The shake went down my throat so smoothly and there were no icicle chunks.  The only chunks is the small pieces of strawberry.  Yummy goodness in my mouth!    Good burgers, shakes and fun.  My calorie count skyrocketed after eating here, but it's worth it just to let loose and forget about your weight for one day.

This was a quaint little restaurant and reminds me of House of Trick near ASU.  I feel like I'm in the French countryside enjoying a home-cooked meal.  What's interesting about this restaurant is that the menu is constantly revolving and they use whatever ingredients they have on hand.    I came here during restaurant and had the pleasure of trying multiple dishes.  For the first course, a salmon crepe was selected.  It was minced salmon wrapped in a crepe.  The sauce was an olive oil drizzle.  The crepe was crispy on the outside, and the smoked Scottish salmon has a slight saltiness to it bringing out the flavor of the dish.    For the main course, it was a tender filet.  The outside was a bit overcooked, but the inside was tender.  I was surprised that the waiter never asked us how we like it prepared, and I had forgotten to specify have a medium-rare steak.  The taste wasn't memorable, but the presentation was lovely.  For the main course, I had a chance to taste my friend's Bouillabaisse.  I almost wished that was on the restaurant week's menu.  Unlike some of the other bouillabaise, they didn't overdo the tomato in the sauce and had a very creamy soup making the dish light, but flavorful.  The variety of herbs brought out the natural flavors of the seafood.  The dessert was a vanilla soufflé.  The texture was so fluffy and luxurious.  The cream drizzled on top wasn't that sweet too making it a perfect end to the end without overdoing it.    Overall I had good service and lovely experience on the food.  I would stick with the classic countryside simple French dishes, and you'll probably be able to enjoy new dishes each time when you come.

Tucked in the corner on the opposite side of the Chandler mall, blink and you may not even notice it.  Walking in the restaurant, you won't even suspect it's a Thai restaurant.  The contemporary decor makes this place not like the other traditional Thai places.  It's it's super clean as well.  On top of that, it uses Ikea plates/bowls.  Yes. I paid attention to the little details. :-).  Now onto the food portion.  I came here a few times and tried a few dishes.  One of my favorites is the drunken noodles.  It wide flat stir-fried noodles are cooked to a comfortable texture.  Not too chewy and still tender.  This dish reminds me of the Chinese dish: Gan Chao He Fen (stir-fried hor fun) but without any beef and less greasy/oily.  All it has in it are the noodles, crispy onions, basil leaves and chili.  So simple, yet very delicious.  The basil leaves didn't overpower the dish at all.  I also tried their Stir-fried Thai Basil, which is one of their signature dishes according to one of their servers.  But that dish, the basil flavor was a bit too strong for me.  Of course I have to try the comoon Thai food, the yellow curry and see how it compares to other Thai restaurants.  Their portions are huge.  I couldn't even finish it.  I asked for a medium and it was just the right amount of spiciness.  The curry sauce is thick and creamy and it comes with more vegatables than some of the other Thai restaurant.    This place has its unique spin on Thai comfort food, but still keeping the traditional taste.  Its slight changes from the usual makes this place a gem and worth trying out again and again.

I discovered this place driving around Arizona State trying to find a cheap place for lunch.  As a ramen lover, it's difficult to find a good ramen place in the valley.  So when I saw a ramen place, I thought I'd try this one out.  Walking in gave me a hip trendy vibe.  It's definitely college friendly.  A modern look.  The menu has everything you'd expect in a ramen shop: regular ramen, spicy ramen, seafood, and vegetarian.  But the star of the show is definitely the Tonkotsu ramen.  Even the cashiers would recommend this choice.  It's a milky pork stock soup.  I ordered it with chashu (Japanese soysauce marinated) pork and egg.  The ramen was cooked perfectly: bouncy and not soggy.  The thinly sliced pork had just enough fat to be tender and flavorful.  When they served it, it came with bean sprouts and spinach.  Everything came together with the help of the broth.  Adding a bit of the red pepper gives it a good kick, but it doesn't overpower the flavor of the soup.  I definitely recommend anyone with a passion for ramen and Japanese food to try this place.  For those who are indecisive or unsure what to order.  Repeat after me to the cashier: Tonkotsu ramen with chashu pork and egg please!  5 star only b/c of the Tonkotsu.

This place is fairly new and the decor shows how clean it is.  But it doesn't give me the HotPot vibe.  It  was pretty empty when I went there for dinner and it's a Southeast Asian decor.  And I thought Hot Pot is mainly a Chinese thing.    I had the Ying Yang pot (spicy and plain on the two sides of the pot).  The pork broth produces a strong flavor for the soup.  All the spices in the two sides made the base very strong and flavorful.  Actually it almost seemed a bit too heavy for my taste. And the spicy side is very spicy (at least to me).  For the additional sauces they had their own version of soy sauce and a peanut sauce.  It was a bit sweet for my taste, so I didn't use it that much.  But the meat and vegetables dipped in the broth was definitely enough for flavor.  The napa especially soaked up the spicy broth very nicely.  I like drinking the broth after the meal to relax my stomach, but the strong broth is more like a starter soup instead of an ending soup.  We had the shabu beef and lamb.  They were sliced thinly, but the meat just didn't seem as tender as I would like it.  And the portions were very very small.  The presentation/dishes were very nice, but the food quality just isn't there.  If you like strong broth flavors, then you can try this place.  But honestly, as far as Hot Pot goes, this place is very expensive with very little portions.  For the price we paid, we could have gone to Texas Roadhouse for a prime rib.  The food provided is about average as well.  If you can't travel to California and you have a craving Hot Pot, then I guess this is the only alternative.  But it may be better and cheaper if you just set it up at home.

One of the first things I noticed when walking into Shinbay is that the decor is very clean and simple. Very FengShui.  A sleek modern appearances matches the style of food served at the restaurant.  We had the 7 course chef's special which I recommend b/c it'll give you best variety.  The meal begins with a hot towel presented to you to prep you for the rest of the night. 1.  First course: The Abura Tsukuri - wild halibut with hot grape seed oil.  The fish was very fresh and served slightly cool.  The oil has a tangy taste with a subtle sweetness which was a good complement.   2.  The hamachi salad with onion soy dressing seemed plain, but at least the hamachi was fresh. 3.  The 3rd course was my favorite.  It had 6 sample pieces of tsukuri: Tuna tartar, king crab, live orange clam, seared scallop, kumamoto oysters & blue shrimp.  The presentation was immaculate.  I didn't want to eat it.  :-)  The fresh fish in each sample complemented the seasonings and vegetables.  Each sample is able to eaten in its entirety.  This is the best way to eat it as all the flavors and textures mixed in the mouth creates a wonderful blend. 4.  The steamed black cod with shimeji mushroom, spinach, etc.  This soup was probably the most traditionally prepared dish of the tasting menu.  Light, simple and good transition before the heavier course that came afterwards. 5. Washu beef with housemade steak sauce.  This was a fun course b/c you get to be the cook.  Let the beef fat melt on the grill, and grill the meat.  The beef was of high quality and very thinly cut.  It only needed to be lightly seared on the grill to bring out the flavor of the meat, which I liked.  The steak sauce (used sparingly) was an added bonus. 6. Nigiri section: kinme dai, kisu, sheda ebi, big eye tuna, kampachi, o-toro. The sauce, wasabi & rice were already added on the sushi. The blend of the ingredients didn't overpower the flavor of the fish.  7. Steamed egg custard with dark cane syrup and fruit.  This was a great way to end the meal.  What I loved about this dessert was that it was simple and not too sweet.   Overall, this was an excellent place for modern Japanese cuisine.  I felt like each of the dishes provided a hint of sweetness in the flavor and the Japanese fusion gives a different appeal to the traditional Japanese food.  All the fish was of fine quality and served at the correct temperature.  Sometimes I feel like the sushi/sashami at certain restaurant are served too cold.

I definitely got a sodium overdose at this place.  I got the chicken enchiladas which seemed like a good idea at the time.  The sauce and the salsa had so much salt in it. I could barely tell the taste of the dish.   The tortilla and chicken are fine, but I just couldn't get over how salty everything is.   The sides were rice and black beans.  The beans good, but Just average. But probably I have this place a 2 star instead of 1. The rice was really hard. They definitely undercooked it.   The tres leches dessert was actually not bad. It's a bit sweet, but not too much. Not like how the enchiladas were salty.  They even delivered it to our table even though this is a fast food place.   Another note: it's set up like Chiptole stores, but the glass in front of the food preparers is a bit high. Found that I had to tippy toe so the guy could here me better.

This is the place to be when you're feeling British and want to have some afternoon tea and eat some finger food and desserts.  Opt for the unlimited champagne as well.  I've seen the same staff for years too and they're always friendly and attentive.   The deets: I've been coming here for years and the menu hasn't changed.  It's been delightful from the first day to my most recent visits.  I always opt to get the basic champagne package as well.  Afternoon tea just isn't complete until you have some champagne.  I never tried the higher tier champagne, however the basic one is good enough for me.    You can try as many of the tea as you wish.  I think I probably have tried them all.  I usually stick with the lighter types of tea.  I don't like the berry or fruity ones as much, but that's just personal preference.  I think all of them are great qualities even if the flavors don't suit me.   My favorite finger sandwiches are the asparagus & garlic herb mousse and salmon.  They are a good blend of veggies & cream/mousse.  Though I always get all the sandwiches, I still think the cucumber has a bit too much of cream cheese.  You may love it because of the strong cream cheese flavor.  The sandwiches are my favorite course.    The next course are the buttermilk and cranberry scones.  They come with devonshire cream, lemon curd & strawbrry preserves.  The Devonshire cream is the best.  Light, fluffy and wonderful with the buttermilk scone.  Maybe not as amazing as the authetic Devonshire cream in the UK, but pretty good.  I think the cranberry scone has a bit much cranberries.    The pastries are cute and tasty as well.  My favs: eclairs, mango dome & chocolate covered strawberries.  You can eat and drink as much as you want from the menu, so be prepared to have a very light dinner later.
