A terrible experience all around, it took forever to get our drinks, and it took around 50 minutes to get our food even though the place was not that busy. On top of that the manager was having a discussion with the servers near the kitchen door because the servers were complaining about the cook having an attitude (couldn't that be done somewhere besides the dining area?) and being slow. Our server had an attitude the entire time as well, and even heard him complain about getting new customers and not wanting to clear off the tables next to us.   Negative experience all around, our food was OK but everything else was not pleasant to say the least.

There is not much I can say about this place except that every time we've went it has been a pleasant experience. Their pizza is quite good, perhaps not the best in the world but still quite tasty. The one time I had an issue they promptly addressed it and even gave me a gift card.  What really sets this place apart in my mind is their wonderful broasted chicken. It is easily among the best fried chicken in Phoenix, they also have a great all you can eat deal on Wednesdays. The chicken is crispy and flavorful right until the last bite due to the marinade. If it has an issue it is that it may be too salty for the more salt sensitive people out there, but IMO, it is far from overwhelming, and each bite has a combination of flavors. We will be moving to a different state next year and will definitely miss this franchise, specifically this particular location.   I've yet to have anything at this place I'd consider sub-par or average. Not to mention the fact that the atmosphere is very soothing and quiet every time we've went.

This place has great comfort food, nothing fancy but I don't expect nor want it from a place like this. We have been here twice and both times were excellent. The first time around I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was flavorful not to mention massive. This last time I decided to change things up and get the catfish, and I have to say this was easily the best catfish I've gotten from a restaurant, it is perfectly seasoned and melts in your mouth. Catfish isn't my favorite fish and far too many places can't make it properly, the sweetness of the catfish almost overpowers things. Not here, the flavor of the breading and the work in harmony. I will definitely get catfish again here! Oh yeah, their Texas Potatoes (or whatever they are called) are good as well, basically they are potato chunks that are fried, in fact I am willing to bet they double fry them to give the outerlayer a crispy texture.   The restaurant itself resembles your typical small town restaurant, and that is fine with me since I grew up with restaurants like it. Their walls are covered with pictures, posters, signs and whatever else they can put up on it, it gives it an unique look. If you want a "nice" restaurant then you better look elsewhere, but if you want a hometown family restaurant and bar setting this is your place.  Service is fantastic as well, our server was constantly refilling our drinks and extremely friendly. One nice aspect of this place is that they give you large glasses for your beverage, so you usually only need a refill or two, we had a bit more because we were recovering from the summer heat.  Also for the record they carry Pepsi products, which is a bonus for me, but may not be for others.  In regards to price, they aren't cheap (the chicken fried steak is around 13 and the catfish for two big filets was around 12), but you will have more then enough food so it works out in the long run.   Overall a great small town style restaurant and bar if you are looking for a hearty meal that is made right.

Not sure what all the positive reviews are for, I went here the other day and was not the least bit impressed. I heard good things about their cheesesteaks, and since I have never had a cheesesteak before I thought I'd try them out. There wasn't much meat in the sandwich, and it lacked cheese. I told them no onions and yet onions were still sprinkled throughout the sandwich.  Even their salad was terrible, the ranch was runny and it didn't even have any croutons on it. The prices were kind of high and the place was extremely dirty. Will never go back again.

As a preface in the past I've been happy with Open Wide Dental, and have been going here for almost 4 years now off and on, but a series of circumstances have left an extremely bitter taste in my mouth. To begin back towards the beginning of the month I called them because I was having issues with one of my teeth and wanted a call back to see about any financing or if they could help me out in any way since I'm low income like they have in the past. No response after close to a week, this should have been my first sign, but I called again, they left a voice mail soon after with no real answer to my question, it was basically "We'll see, maybe, after you see us". Not really the kind of response I wanted since my concern was finances, what if I went in and they couldn't work with me now?  Anyway I took the chance (once again it is my fault for ignoring the signs) and called them back, made an appointment for a couple of weeks. The night before my appointment I became ill which was keeping me awake as well, so I had no choice but to cancel my appointment. To be fair it was past the normal 24 hr window (I left the message around 12 am because I knew there was no way I was going to feel good enough to go) cancellation I've ever made with them. I called them that morning to make sure they got my message, they did, and that was that. A week later I get a $50 "no show" bill sent to me. Which they have every right to do, but doesn't make it good business when you have a loyal customer who always shows up to their appointments, AND referred MULTIPLE people to their location.   I was, of course, upset and did call and leave a message expressing my disappointment and that I was a bit angry about it, but it was a civil message, even if I was clear that I would not pay the $50, that I felt it was a slap in the face, and because of our financial situation I would have no choice but to go somewhere else if it wasn't resolved. That was over a week ago and no response. So much for caring about your customers. If they are willing to lose me as a customer, and maybe future referrals, that is their prerogative but it seems like a bad move to do this over $50. But it seems consistent with my treatment I received with a lack of response prior to the $50 no show (which I didn't even know they had).   Have to give them credit though, they did get my bill of $50 to me faster then any responses to my phone inquiries!  Update 6/10  Never heard back from them, but they were once again on time with sending me the same bill. Clearly they don't care about resolving issues with long time customers.

What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This place has tremendous food and will not drain your bank account. I tend to not be a big salsa fan, mainly because of the overly chunky salsa, but their salsa is just the consistency for me, and tastes great. Their enchiladas are amongst the best I've had.  The thing that gives this place even more of an edge is the service, it has to be seen to believed. Chips and salsa seldom get low before they bring out another bowl of chips, or refill your salsa. The same can be said for their drink refills. There is not a slacker to be found at this place, and even if it is packed, you can be rest assured you'll be treated with efficiency and speed with an energetic team effort.  I don't give out 5 stars easily, but this place deserves it. Not sure how "authentic" the food is, but I like to think I know what GOOD food is and this place has that!  P.S. Their margaritas may not have top quality ingredients but they are cheap, and tasty!

Horrendous from beginning to end, I had an appointment for 8:00 AM to get lab work done, it was 1 hr and 15 minutes after my appointment time before I was called back, close to 3 people who came in after me went before me. The place itself is dirty, crowded, and noisy.   I wonder what is the point of making an appointment when it still takes over an hour to get in? There was a man who came in without one and they told him it would take an hour. So really what is the point?

Talk about a contrast in restaurants and customer service. My fiancee and I were trying to have a nice night out, the first restaurant we went to pretty much ignored us until we got up and walked out. On the flip side this place was welcoming and our server was fantastic. She was prompt in refilling our drinks and did everything she could to make it a great experience. Her name was Marsi, want to make sure I give her all the credit in the world.  Anyway, I ordered the chicken fried chicken and my fiancee ordered the smoked sampler. Our food arrived, though our server said she was not happy with the country gravy, she felt it was too watery, but brought it in a cup so I could judge for myself. It was extremely watery for whatever reason, and she came back saying that her manager wanted to take the whole plate back so they could prepare everything again (I did not complain once, all this was initiated by the server from the start) and that I'd be comped on my portion of the dinner.  While waiting I tried a bit of the brisket my finacee had and it was really excellent. My fiancee said the whole dish was good except she wasn't too thrilled with the type of cut they used for the pork ribs, but overall it was a really good meal. My dish arrived, and it was the best chicken fried chicken I've ever had, the breaded chicken breast was super tender, almost melt in your mouth, and the breading was flavorful and light, almost a tempura style. The remade gravy was just the right consistency and really good all on its own. The side of green chile mac & cheese, something I've never had before was excellent as well, along with the steak fries, which is saying a lot since I usually don't care for steak fries.  We will back again, they helped salvage what was looking to be a bad night out. The place may be kind of pricey but from what I tried it was worth it.

The full story behind this experience is that I attended a birthday party which was held here. At one time this was a place that was quite good. Took right at 50 minutes to get our food (before that it took 10-15 minutes to just get our water) and when we finally received the pizzas, my fiancée's tasted like leather, and my pizza was BURNT leather. The individual who was celebrating his birthday received cold food, not sure about the others at the party. They took my pizza and asked if I wanted another, I told them that was fine, the last one made me sick. Chewing on something that resembles a burnt baseball glove tends to make one a bit nauseated.  To be fair they did take it back and redid the cold dish, beyond that their only compensation was that they didn't charge for my pizza. To put it bluntly I have NEVER had a pizza so inedible in my life. When you wish you were having Pizza Hut, Dominos, or even a cheap frozen pizza, you know there are some major issues with the food.  To sum up this review, a business's value and service is best represented by how they respond to issues that crop up, bad or off putting food cannot always be avoided, it is the nature of the restaurant business. Where Harley's Bistro failed miserably at was in responding to the appalling food, and slow service. It is obvious management does not care for the customer, or they would try a little harder to make things right, especially at someone's birthday celebration. They also blamed the 10 inch thin crust pizza for things coming out slow, which seems like a suspect excuse at best. Surprised they didn't blame the Pizza for them taking over 10 minutes to get us ice water as well.

Melrose Pharmacy in the past has been reliable but lately they have been sloppy and appear to care less and less about their customers. In the last few months I've had prescription refills not properly sent out to my doctor, prescriptions have been lost, I have been shorted multiple times on prescriptions with an IOU.   The final nail in the coffin of this once good pharmacy is that a good feature they once had, a charge account, is being limited more and more. Even though I've been someone that has paid their bill every month, even living paycheck to paycheck, barely getting by, I've been told they can no longer go past their ever shrinking "allowable" charge with the excuse that some do not pay their bill. I've been going to this pharmacy for 3 years and have been a consistent, reliable customer yet there is no flexibility or caring on their part for my financial situation and the fact that I need the charge account because I barely get by as is, 30-40 dollars (which is what my prescriptions usually come to every month) is a lot of money when you barely scrape by month to month.   Ever after calling and talking to an employee there, I was still basically told they will not be flexible even though I stated my next step was to regrettably take my business elsewhere (after paying my balance of $16 and my last remaining prescriptions) which is an indication they apparently no longer want my business, The next step will be to take my prescriptions elsewhere, I may not get a charge account, but when a place is already threatening to cancel it, what is the difference? It is too bad because they have good people working there, but they appear to be losing site of customer needs, especially a customer that has been loyal even with various issues.

We had a yelp groupon to G's Food because we heard good things about the place. What we encountered blew us away. I'm still a big confused if their hot dog buffet is every day of the week, or just Friday and Saturday along with their other food choices. Regardless it is 14.99 and that includes a drink, we came during their all you can eat king crab legs and prime rib. Both were extremely good, and this place is hardly your typical buffet. In fact  when you walk in it looks like a small diner with a buffet row, it is very much a "divish" location. In addition to the what is on the line, I was told you can choose ANYTHING from their menu as well and it is included. Since this place is primarily a diner most of the time you can expect quality food.   Their hot dogs are excellent all beef hot dogs, and they have various other choices in sausages. There are a TON of toppings to choose from, whether it is cheese sauce (which was not bad at all), to real bacon bits to about anything else you can think of. If you want something from their menu just ask, it is included with the buffet, they'll prepare it fresh. So you want all you can eat cheesesteaks? They have you covered, unfortunately I didn't get the chance to try them because we mainly came for the all you can eat crab legs, but I will next time! I believe there are different price levels for their buffet, so make sure to ask, I believe the hot dog buffet by itself is around $8.  Above all us you can tell the place is run by good down to earth people, which I suspect are also the owners. You can tell they care about their customers and will provide you with excellent service with a GENUINE smile. Even if their food was sub par (which it isn't) the service would make me want to come back. Unfortunately we came close to closing so some of the buffet items were thinned out, but I have little doubt you could just request them to prepare something for you.  Looking at their menu, even if you choose to order individual items their prices are excellent! So if you are looking for a positive environment, (with great people working there) with good food at excellent prices you can't go wrong with G's Food.

I've always been a fan of 180 Degree Automotive, but this last event was pretty horrible. Roughly 20 days ago I started my 2003 Ford Taurus and it started missing and the check engine light came on, so I had it towed to 180 degree auto. They checked the car out for a day and said one of the cylinders wasn't firing and they were going to change out the spark plugs on the suspected cylinder and see if that was the problem. Turns out it wasn't, so they told me it could be the following issues:  1. The ignition coil 2. The Engine itself  They suggested replacing the ignition coil first for $530. So I OKed it since I had little choice. After replacing the coil I was called  and told that it didn't solve the problem, but "made it slightly better", and that they'd have to replace or dismantle the motor which would cost thousands of dollars. After talking to family it was decided it would be better for me to find another car, and I was ready to sign the title over to 180 degree auto for the $530 bill (yes they were still going to charge me for the ignition coil even though it basically solved nothing). I rented a car since my fiancee would lose her job since she wouldn't be able to get to work. After car shopping for a few days (180 Degree was looking into how to go about the title issue), and talking to family, they decided they would help repair my old car and replace the engine since it would be cheaper then getting another car. We were quoted $4100 (so basically 4630 if you add in the ignition coil).  This was decided on Wednesday the 12th of June, and 180 Degree found a used motor with less then 100k in miles. They got the motor in Monday and discovered it had water in it so they sought out another, this next one had even less miles on it. They got it in yesterday (Wednesday the 19th) and when talking to the owner of the motor they discovered that they had "bad information" and that the cylinder that they thought was the problem wasn't really it, and the REAL cylinder was misfiring because, get this, a bad spark plug wire. So after 20 days and $540 later in rental car bills, they tell me that they made a mistake and it wasn't the engine but a spark plug! They fixed everything for free (including waiving the ignition coil replacement bill), and even did an oil change. Trouble is that I was still $540 in the hole for their blunder and while I appreciate their honesty, it is unacceptable that something like this happened.  I haven't decided if I am going to push for compensation on our rental car, but it would be nice if they comped it somehow because it seems to be the right thing to do. This was an EXTREMELY costly mistake that could have been MUCH MUCH worse if the decision wasn't made to replace the motor. My car would have been given to 180 Degree Auto that wasn't really broken and I'd likely be stuck with a car loan on a used car. I respect Bogi, the owner, and her staff, but I can't let this issue slide, it is too big to let go.   Update:  Bogi, the owner, contacted me and we came up with a fair solution to reimburse my expenses. She was clearly disappointed in how things went down and wants to do everything she can within reason to make it right. Will be changing my review because she has really shown honesty and integrity through this nightmare for all involved!  Update Number 2:   Received a surprise delivery from Edible Arrangements today from Bogi the owner. Really impressive and like I've always said you find the true worth and integrity of a business when something goes wrong, whether bad or good. With 180 degree I think they have demonstrated they care about their customers and mean it.

After eating here, it all boils down to one term, mediocre. Me and my fiancee both purchased a torta, and while service was excellent, the food was just, well, average. One thing that hit me was how low quality the ingredients were, the meats tasted like they were purchased in the lunch meat aisle at a supermarket, and brand X meat at that. It didn't taste fresh, and in my sandwich's case (the La Reyna) like they used the cheapest sausage they could find. The breaded chicken on the sandwich had extremely sweet and cheap tasting batter on it. Even the egg tasted like it came out of a carton. Perhaps I just picked a poor sandwich, but my fiancee was not a fan of the Del Ray either, one of their favorite menu items.  Since I do not want to focus on the bad, our drinks were constantly attended to, the food came quickly, and for the price vs filling your belly was positive. Then again when you use such, apparently, cheap ingredients it is no wonder they can keep prices low!  It was a unique experience, just to see the massive sandwiches but we will not be going back.

What can I say about Mamma Mia that hasn't been said? It is a quality pizza place with good prices. I've purchased food from them 4 times, and have enjoyed it each time. Their stromboli is to die for (probably figuratively and literally considering what is in one!), albit a bit greasy, but that has never really bothered me. The pizza can be greasy as well, but nothing to really dock the place much. I stick with the basics pepperoni and extra cheese. The ingredients all taste wonderfully, and taste fresh.  If I have any complaint about Mamma Mia, it is that their wings are pretty average, not great, not bad. I've tried their BBQ, and standard buffalo wings. At least they are quite meaty, unlike so many places with wings, where they appear to have pulled the wings from a baby chicken.   In conclusion though, if you want a quality pizza, or stromboli, this is the place.

I've been here a few times and have to say it has been a great experience every time. I've primarily had their rocket sized cheeseburgers with bacon and everything has a home cooked taste to it. It is obvious the food is made with love here, and it is always reassuring to see the owner hard at work in the restaurant serving customers, not to mention cooking.  Probably the only disappointing thing is that the last time we went their cheese curds were overly salty. Note I have a HIGH tolerance for salt, and this was even too much for me, it was extremely over the top. Let them know about it through email and they never did respond which is disappointing, but considering how good everything else is here I'll let it slide.

What can I say? I am really impressed by their business, last week we got two regular subs, when we got home we noticed that it seemed to be lacking in meat and the cheese was non-existent on one and paper thin on the other. The subs were still good, but it was disappointing and I sent my concern off to Jersey Mike's. Within a couple of hours the manager of the location I had this experience called me.  She offered to treat my family to a sub dinner for our trouble. That is obvious commitment to quality service. The subs were fantastic this time. Turns out they were actually having issues with the slicer the day I went.   They will get my business again, their subs are tasty, with quality ingredients, and they are committed to customer service. Yes their prices are a bit higher then a place like subway, but you do get what you pay for!

After waiting patiently for this place to open, when they finally did me and my fiancee went out to dinner with a few friends. I did not like the lay out of the place at all, as previous reviewers touched upon, it is one line and things get congested too easily. It makes for an unpleasant visit when you are heading to the buffet.  The food itself was decent quality, by buffet standards, they have the basics, seafood, basic american cuisine like chicken nuggets, pizza, sushi, and other asian cuisine like sweet N sour items, orange chicken, etc. The sushi was quite bland, the salad bar was pretty terrible, the lettuce was quite limp, and the main courses were nothing that stood out. Usually when I go to a buffet there is one or two items that I'd find above average, but here I cannot really think of anything that went beyond the average column.   If I were to give this business advice, it would be to restructure their buffet line to help with people getting bogged down, and to offer a bit more variety and up their food quality. Most chinese buffets I've been too have had a salmon dish, there was none to be found here, the only fish dishes I found were a grilled fish (which was not edible, it tasted disgusting and bland) and deep fried Tilapia which was extremely bony. Just one example of the poor variety they have here.  I will give the place another shot, perhaps it was just a bad day.

One of the best doctors I've been to, it is so hard to fine a good doctor that knows what they are doing. He has always been timely in getting me referrals and has always been thorough when I've had medical problems arise instead of brushing me off like doctors often can do. The rare times where he isn't sure what else to do or if something needs specialized attention he will refer me to a specialist.   I'm not sure what all happened when he previously worked at Fit, and really I don't care, he has been a great doctor for me and knows his stuff. I trust him and he has never broken that trust with me, he cares and that is what matters most in a doctor. When we move up north to Washington State I will definitely miss him and his staff. I hope I am able to find someone half as good!

For my birthday party a day ago my fiancee and some friends bought me a cake from Tammie Coe for their surprise party. It was jaw droppingly gorgeous, it was a gothic coffin cake with red velvet and cheesecake filling between. The artistic design and details were fantastic, it was something I almost didn't want to cut into! One top of it all it was delicious, very moist and full of flavor. Thanks to Tammie Coe for helping make my birthday one of the most, if not the most, memorable ever

We have been waiting for a Papa Murphy's to open within driving distance of where we live (The closest one before this location that we were aware of was almost 25 miles away), so I was pleased to find one just recently opened.  When I entered the manager (I'm guessing the owner of the franchise) was out and about among the people having conversations with them. Definitely a positive thing to see and shows he cares about making the place a success. When I got up to the register to order I noticed I wasn't offered a punch card or coupons like another customer was, so I had to request a punch card myself. Minor issue though, and understandable, that stuff happens time to time especially when it is busy like the place was getting.  Pizza was prepared quickly (got a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and what appeared to be a new pizza, the bacon bacon bacon.  The pepperoni pizza turned out really well, but the bacon bacon bacon had a lot to be desired, not sure if it was made improperly or it is standard, but it was overpowered by the onions on it. Besides the issue with the one pizza and having to ask about the punch card (forgot about asking about the coupons) it was a good experience.

I purchased a groupon for this establishment because I've been looking for a good southern style restaurant in the Phoenix area. We went into with high hopes even though the place appears to be pretty new given the few reviews.  When arriving the restaurant appeared to be pretty clean, though the floors were kind of sticky, but nothing major. We were seated and the server took our drink order, I had a diet coke and my fiancee got a peach tea. Now keep in mind when we got there, there were only 4 parties of people, one group was getting ready to leave. So basically there were only 3 groups, me and my fiancee, another two individuals and a larger group of 5. Nothing too major. I noticed the server talking with other staff, and roughly 10 minutes later we still didn't have our drinks, in fact our server was just having a conversation with the big group. Another employee who was off the clock came in and started talking with the manager.   To say we felt ignored would have been an understatement. The manager finally came to us to ask if we wanted drinks (yes we were asked that again), and we repeated our order to him that we gave the server. Our server turns around from the big group of people and shouts "Oh the diet coke is sitting in the kitchen". So basically our drinks were just sitting there, the server clearly had other priorities. By the time the manager came with our drinks we had enough, it is not a good feeling to be ignored completely by your server especially in a place that wasn't even close to being busy.   If this place wants to stay in business they probably should treat their customers with a bit more respect whether there is one customer or 10. It seemed clear the server was more interested in the big group of people, heck the other couple was waiting for their check the whole time we were there.  Yeah I paid money for the groupon, but it got to the point where it just wasn't worth it. We were trying to have a nice night out and they almost ruined it. Thankfully we found a wonderful restaurant where we actually felt welcome so the night wasn't a bust after all. I've maybe walked out of one restaurant my entire life, Down South is now the 2nd.  Too bad, because the food may have been pretty good.
