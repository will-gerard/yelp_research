This Costco is the best. Its never super busy even on weekend mornings. Parking isnt a nightmare ever! There are cute boys who work there all over the place, and VERY helpful :)

Ihave gotten halloween costumes from here.. both bought an rented. Renting can be a little scary since you dont know who the person was before you and how clean the costume really is.. but I felt ok about the quality of the costume. They also have tons of good face make up for making yourself a zombie, or corpse or whatever your needs might be in that area.

Super good! And kinda hidden around bigger named places so I would assume it gets missed by alot of people. their house dressing that they put on their salad is SO DELISH! I wish they sold it in bottles! I sat at the bar, on a weekday afternoon, on another one of my solo lunch adventures. I got a cocktail and it was made perfectly- a little strong, which is totally they way I like it.

A friend of mine lives here, and I have been over alot in the last few weeks. During the day, the leasing staff gives me dirty looks as if I am lowering the value of renting there.  However my friends apartment is nice and he never seems to have issues getting things fixed if need be. One major flaw- I feel like I know the upstairs neighbors cause I can hear every step they make, what they are watching on tv and sometimes even their phone calls

I wish more things were booked here, for alot of reasons. If I could change it, I would make them also buy shows instead of just be rented out as a venue. The security staff is pretty awesome as well as the bartenders. Maybe a few less 16 and over shows, to avoid all the kids...

Ok so I am not the average age of a skateboarder...Im not even the average gender. BUT i do like to ride to break hangovers and to clear my mind when dumb stuff starts to bother me. I like this place..  Weekdays are better if you are not looking to be over run with kids and at nights you can get away with skating pretty late. Oh dont bring your dog here tho

They have fun specials, and kinda cool theme nights. Really good food for a bar. The manager/bartender Nate makes this place worth going to even if they had shitty everything else.

Ok so I had driven by this place about 50 times or so, ad always thought to myself...when is my lingerie needs gonna call for a superstore...and why does the building have a drive up window?  "Ill have the #2 combo- size medium, panties and a whip"... Come to find out when I did need a superstore to find my outfit to bartend the Fetish Ball, the drive threw window is left over from whatever was there prior, and not used for people who need lube on the go. They had a good selection of corsets and little bootie shorts and skirts. I was also looking for my bartending partner and he is a guy... Not a whole lot of men selections.. But the girls there were helpful and willing to lace me up tight in the corsets I did try on. ALSO working the fetish events... I got 15% off

I've been to a lot of nail salons. I mean a ton. I've been getting my nails done for about 6 years now, if not longer. My biggest annoyance was always , that id go get my nails or toes done and felt really uncomfortable. The ladies or gentleman would always talk to each other in whatever language and you just they are talking about you. And they would laugh and giggle. I hated it.  My friend brought me to Tips and Toes and I liked it right off the bat. The staff were super cool. They dont talk to each other, they actually talk to you.. they always comment and compliment me and my friends on our tattoos. I have never had an appointment, and never had to wait more than a few mins.

I will only come here if the band playing is someone I REAAAAALLLY wanna see. Its way to hot in there, not too impressed with staff..bar or door... and any place that has drive buys when hip hop shows are booked...not a huge fan

I spend WAY to much money here. Not Because of the prices but because this is one of my favorite stores in tempe marketplace Of all the restaurants and cafes in Tempe Marketplace   good service, a clean usually child free atmosphere, the best selection of tea falvors anywhere. I havent tried any of their yummy  looking treats, yet.... but i hear they are GREAT

I like this target better than the one that is actually a bit closer to me. Plus being in Tempe Marketplace I can go here and about 15 other places to spend money that should be going towards bills or something. :) I have had to return a few items, and that is never a hassle or problem, the people are always nice. However, the checkout lines are kinda long most of the time. But with a Starbucks inside, cant really complain!

this place is good, simple and fast. Tuesdays they have deep fried beef tacos for 99 cents so I stay away from here on that night. The Al Pastor tacos are super super gooooooood. I havent ever had a bad thing on this menu. The fish tacos, are nothing special, but still not bad.  The owenrs are always walking around, checking on tables and super nice guys.  Really cool art on the walls

My only real complaint is coming south on Scottsdale road, to get to it you need to make a u turn, and the idiots coming out of Gregio Apartments seem to turn right without looking...

Your receipt will say it all. "$3 Car bomb..F*YEAH".. I dont even like carbombs but I tend to do atleast one EVERYTIME I go there. Also Wednesdays is $3 Guinness day.. not gonna be able to beat that anywhere. The food is so yummy, but if you are in a hurry, this may not be the place for you. And the owner, gooood lord! I have the biggest crush, the things I would let that man do to me.

I don't know how long this place has been here but I'm glad I have found it now! They do take out and delivery till 330am which is rad for the bar crowd. I have usually do delivery which is super fast. I've been inside once...its like a sauna in there! They are really well priced. Dont let the ghetto look of the plaza detour you from trying this place out

I bought my bike here maybe 2 years ago. Anytime I come in for something, they are super cool and friendly. I have dropped my bike off twice to have stuff done to it, and the guy has always offered to bring me my bike up at my work. I dont know if this is a normal thing they do, but RAD none the less!

Im at Starbucks, different locations like 3 times a day. My order is always right, service is always fast, and its an easy place to come sit and get some work done on my laptop.

What crap! Not open on sundays? How can you call yourself "hangover" anything and be closed on a Sunday! Other than that nonsence... this place is soo good. The pesto bomb sandwich is so delish! They are huge sandwiches and not expensive at all. I pick up food from here atleast once a week for everyone at work.

They NEVER seem to have my bra size in the bra I want when I am at this location. SMALL BOOBS are common- they need to stock their items better. And gay or not, I dont really want a guy asking to size me for anything or checking on me in the dressing room. Just sayin

Ok, I am on like day 16 of ordering from this place. NOTHING IS BAD on the menu. The baked ziti is sooo delish and the portion is HUGE. The steak and cheese philly is the best I have had in awhile. My staff orders pizza and wings, and cold sammies from there too, and we cant get enough! And yesterday we even got a pretty cute delivery driver!

This place was awful! First they have someone out front spinning a sign to get u to come in who resembles Large Marge from Pee Wees Big adventure. Gross. Once inside there was a stale smell of vomit and desperation. The waitress was dressed like a hooters girl but in white with pink shorts. I have to assume she worked a double that day due to how dirty her tank top was, like pig pen. We ordered 2 cocktails..vodka cran, and grape vodka soda..total was 18 bucks...what are in vegas? No in vegas there are distractions to keep u from knowing you are getting ass raped for an ounce and a half of well vodka.
