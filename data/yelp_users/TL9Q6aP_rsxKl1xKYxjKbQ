Their vision center is great, I went to a nationwide vision center and was very displeased by the care I got there, I went last night to Walmart vision center the staff is friendly helpful and talkative, there prices are actually affordable compared to some other optical centers I bought two pairs of glasses they were  $150 dollars cheaper then nationwide vision center price which is only seven minutes away from this Walmart vision center I will not be going anywhere else for my glasses now

Took my 10 year old bull dog "Monty" in for breathing issues, the staff was friendly, knowable and caring about my pups medial needs, the wait was within reason, the service was quick and the Doctor was knowledge and made us feel at ease, it's a horrible experience having your pet have a medical emergency but the staff at the Peoria EAC helped make the episode not so frighting.    I called in the morning to get my medical records Faxed to my own animal hospital for a follow-up and the person that did answer the phone was a bit short with me but I had to realize I'm not the ONLY owner that was seen last night and there was more pressing cases then mine, I feel that when they have a moment my records will be faxed and I feel secure in there hospital ability to care and treat any of my other pets in case there are in need.

Worst service ever, came in at 6pm left at 8:45!!! a table of 15 was to much for them, a long wait to order, took to long to get drinks, my wine glass had lipstick on it when it arrived, a hair in the ranch had to send back a food because  it was room temp. Really that long to get food it was ridiculous, walked out with a $62 dollar bill for a salad and a sandwich two glasses of wine and a beer really this isn't Scottsdale it's Glendale not that wroth the money.

I was surprised that this mass produced sushi was good, I actually had a fun time picking the sushi that goes by you on a conveyor belt, the prices were affordable and food not the BEST sushi I have had but definitely not bad, good sushi fast and fun, my only complaint was my plum wine was spoiled, my first glass was yummy and sweet, the second was a totally different color then my first the waiter took the wine back because the wine tasted sour and brought me a new glass unfortunately I think the whole bottle must have been spoiled, the waiter was nice enough and took it off the bill, we will be coming back to enjoy some sushi fun again :)

I feel so lucky to have found this chapel, Sarah was great to work with and helped me figure out a prefect date and time for my wedding, I look forward to the day and feel secure that everything will go great thanks to Sarah help and upbeat attitude.

Yummy :) I'm a sushi snob but I can not complain about anything here, the fresh taste of the rolls are spectacular, try Spicy Tuna Land soooo very good, Rainbow roll was great tasting and fish was fresh, I have been to great sushi bars/restaurants in Scottsdale, Phoenix and this Surprise restaurant kept up with the taste, finally a sushi place in Surprise I'm so happy. Try this place it's worth it, the price is right on for a sushi place not cheap but not over the line.
