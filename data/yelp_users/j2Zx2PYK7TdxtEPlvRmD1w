My parents took me here to celebrate my college graduation, and had they taken me here BEFORE they got me a present, there would have been no need.....This was place AMAZING!  I love the atmosphere of the small house. This is a huge part of its charm. The staff was kind, and friendly, and very personable. They unexpectedly brought out a desert for me with a "Congratulations Graduate" inscribed with chocolate sauce (bonus!) on the outer rim of the plate. The service alone would make me come back.  But the food. OH. MY. GOD. the FOOD!  I had no expectations going to this restaurant, as i had no idea what it was, or that we were even going until an hour before i arrived. I had no time to do research, and i trust my parents palate to have chosen a sufficient place for dinner. (they did pretty good being from Texas, thanks to you yelpers!)  What we ordered:  To start: the Brie Brulee--INCREDIBLE Three Onion Tart--from the one bite i was able to sneak in from my dad (who fell in love at first taste) it was delicious  I had the Salmon, which was wonderful. Flaky, and moist, and the creme sauce was devine. I don't think i expected it to be as heavy as the dish was, but even so...wonderful. I would probably have enjoyed it more if it were cold outside.  My dad ordered the lamb shank, and it was falling off the bone. I had never had lamb until that day, and i'm glad my first time was at Coup Des Tartes! It was savory, and succulent, and with the vegetables it came with, reminded me of a stew.  My mom had the Pasta, and it was just right! Very light and flavorful, which paired well with the wine we brought.  My brother ordered the Chicken, and while it was one of the "simpler" dishes, it was the best tasting of them all.  The execution from start to finish is something that will not go unmentioned when i recommend this little gem. Keep up the great work! I can't wait to come back!

I ended up at SSY due to my job bringing me so far away from my home (and salon). I was in desperate need of a hair cut, and unable to make it to my normal stylist before they closed. Sure, I could have managed to make it on on the weekend, but who has time?!   Anyway, I chose SSY from a partnership that was developed through my place of work. I was very nervous to try a new salon, but left a VERY satisfied customer. So satisfied that I haven't seen my other hair stylist (of 4 years) for 9 months!   Staci Rae was my stylist my first time around, and I've continued to book her every time.   If you're looking for a great salon in the area, with reasonable prices, this is most certainly your place!

The thing i love most about this place is that it's unique. It's not the same list of deli sandwiches you'd find at most other sub shops, and like others have said, the meat is shredded and not sliced.   The portions are huge, so the price really is worth it. If you're looking for your $5 footlong, please do yourself a favor and run over to subway.   Staff is friendly, quick (even when busy), and they know how to make a great sandwich!  The menu is slightly limited, but what they do offer is great. If i'm ever in a mood for a hearty sandwich, this is the place i go. My fav is the Turkey Cole. Yum!

Oh Mr. Chao...you really let me down.  I decided to order from here on a very important day. I was sick.  When i'm sick I want spicy, hot, asian food. It's what i crave, it's what i need.  Knowing that Panda Express just wasn't going to cut it for this craving, i went to my fellow yelpers for advice. I knew i wanted realllllly good Chinese good, i didn't care how much it cost. When i'm sick, i want what i want, and nothing else matters. However, i needed a place that delivered or i could go and pick up ASAP and Mr. Chao's was it!  I ordered: *Extra Spicy BBQ Pork Fried Rice *Beef & Broccoli (boyfriend) *Steamed Rice (b/f) * General Tso's Chicken-extra spicy  The rice was overcooked. done, done, and done again. The rice kernels were almost stale tasting, just looking at the pork made me sick, and I'm pretty sure i said extra spicy...and there was none. Very bland  Beef & Broccoli was surprisingly good--but it wasn't mine, so boo hoo, moving on  Steamed rice--average...but how could you screw this up?  General's Chk--Much like the rice actually. WAY overcooked. The chicken was extremely dry, and the breading had been BURNED. Also, where the heck was the extra spice i asked for? And lastly, did i order chicken strips? boneless wings? because i got chicken tenders, not chunks.   **I would also like to mention, there was NO language barrier that would cause the mess-up of my order. Unless you consider high school kids to have a different language than us adults--which is entirely possible**  $40 and few dollar tip later, most of it ended in the trashcan, and i ate toast instead.  I won't be back

Everyone here is great!  Tam and Danny really know what their doing with this place and the prices are more than fair.  Ladies, if you need a set of nails, Tony is your guy. (sorry Danny, haven't tried you just yet)  Super fast and does an uh-maz-ing job! For pedicures, all the girls are super nice and do a good job-but i would recommend Tam if you're making an appointment.  Clean facilities and great massage chairs for the pedi's. Broad color selection and their great with designs on all nails too.   Now quit reading this and go get those nails did!

This is for Carmen in the Salon.  While i don't enjoy shopping at this Ulta, i find everyone to be incredibly rude, i thoroughly enjoy making the trip to see Carmen every time i need to get my hair cut.  She's not your typical hair lady who talks nonsense stories, she's someone you can get to know and not feel pressured to do anything but what you want! Isn't that great??  Also, i had just moved to Arizona about 6 months before i saw Carmen for the first time and i had the same hair lady since i was 7....needless to say, i was a nervous nelly! She listened to what i had to say about my hair and took the time to see what she was working with before she got in there.  She's also the salon manager so she definitely knows her shiz.  Anyway...if you're looking for someone new, honest and a great stylist (good prices too) then ask for Carmen at the Chandler Ulta Salon!

Over a year later--working on TWO--I still love my stylist Carmen!  When trying someone new, it's comforting to know that I made a great decision in choosing her as my go-to stylist.   If you're looking to make a switch, or just moved here and are in desperate need of someone amazing, do yourself a favor and call Carmen :)

First I will preface this review with the fact that I am sad to even have to review an auto body shop, considering my visit to Harvil's was due to a "drug" driver (yes, drug, not drunk) and an elderly man who clearly shouldn't have a license. My car was less than 3 weeks old (2012 Sonata!) when my front and rear bumper were practically ripped from my vehicle....  Now, with my sob story out of the way, I turn the page to a happy place as i sincerely thank Harvil's for their service.   With not many reviews of this location, but a recommendation through State Farm, I was a little skeptical on whether or not to give this place a chance. I'm all for supporting small, local businesses, but when it comes to my vehicle (which is the NUMBER ONE thing i'm picky about) I was very scared to put my faith in them 100%.   Nevertheless, I made an appointment, and walked away with estimates that were remarkably fair! At the time I was waiting to hear from another insurance company on their decision of whether or not they were going to accept fault for the claim, so when i receive the estimate, I was fully expecting to have to pay out of pocket. When i saw the estimates I immediately was able to breathe easier--I would NOT need to borrow money from anyone to get my car fixed *yay!* (BTW--the insurance DID end up paying....)  I was given a time frame of when my car would be ready and was called as soon as i could pick it up. I ran into a small issue, as i work over an hour away and I needed to pick up my car (and return a rental) by 5pm on a Friday evening...while having to fight rush hour traffic. I was concerned I would have to pay for the rental car for the rest of the weekend because they are closed, and that i wouldn't get my car until Monday....but they worked with me and stayed there/open until I was able to come and get it. I did make it there just a little after 5 mind you, but they were more than willing to do what they needed in order to help me.   Tim was such a nice man to work with and his team did an amazing job with they work they did on my car. I will absolutely go back if necessary (hoping to God i don't have to though) and will recommend anyone for their service.   THANK YOU HARVIL'S!

I'm sad to report, I had to come back to Harvil's :(  I still trust them and their work, and am happy to know that I have found a place that can assist me in these awful situations at a reasonable price!  Thanks again guys !

Tonight was my first night checking out the Grotto, and after a bad service experience with another place close by, i was ready to eat anywhere at that point.   I have passed the Grotto many times living in Scottsdale, and have often walked by smelling the aromas grazing my senses while strolling by...i love that they seem to always have their doors/windows open and the tables overlooking the street are fantastic.    Anyway, as Brett S. said , the service can be a little bad but it is definitely part of the charm.  Anyone who has every been to a real Italian "joint" understands this.  I was almost pleased with how traditional the feeling was, as in "if you don't like it, get the heck out" haha. It was also a very packed Friday night around 730, so i truly expected nothing but a wait anywhere we went, but we at least found a group of down to earth people entering and exiting wearing everything from jeans and a t-shirt like me, golf attire, to going out clothes. No matter your style, they treated you all the same.  Perfect!  (finding a place like that in Scottsdale is hard to do!)  With it being a Friday night and already having a bad experience with a previous place, i just wanted a square meal and to head home, so i didn't do as much sampling as i would have liked.  We started out with the calamari which came with a marinara sauce with a little kick to it.  It looks like they added red pepper flakes at the end, but it was a nice touch.  I had the house salad with vinaigrette dressing...and word to the wise, if you don't like onions, this salad (at least with the vinaigrette) comes with sneaky chopped marinated red onions in it...so beware! The blue cheese crumbles were a nice touch as well.  My friend ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo and i chose the cannelloni. The fettuccine was much smaller portioned than i thought it would be, especially in comparison to my dish...so if you're very hungry, i would stray from this dish.  While normally a classic favorite, i didn't quite like the added spices to the dish, which seemed to be an Italian seasoning.  The alfredo sauce alone was to die for though.  The cannelloni was phenomenal.  Everything was cooked to perfection and flavored out of this world.   Please also note....when this food is done, it's coming to your table, steaming hot! So wait a few before you take your first bite because you'll probably burn your mouth in some way/shape/form! :o)  Overall the Grotto really picked up my night, and being a yankee in a western state...it's nice to have a piece of home right around the corner.  I'll definitely be coming back!

I must say, i'm very surprised at the overall rating of this location here. First of all, it's on mill, near ASU, so the location itself is prime--star. Secondly, the atmosphere is hip, urban and casual at the same time. another star. Bar--fully stocked, fully staffed, good drinks....another star Now for the food....  I've never raved about Ra...ever. To be honest, when it comes to eating sushi, i have never, ever recommended it to a single person and frankly tell people to stray from it. However, last night i went for happy hour at the mill location (usually go to the one in Ahwatukee) and had great sushi. Everything was fresh, perfectly portioned and just really good! Plus, it was happy hour so the price was even better.  star, star!  The only reason this is only 4 stars, is because i took one away for the layout of the restaurant...the flow is awful lol. thankfully i sat at the bar (full service) so i wasn't subjected to its awkward flow to the fullest.  Even so, I would definitely go back to that location.

Went here for dinner last night with a few ladies and was surprised by the diverse selection the menu provided.   However, being that I was adventureous in even trying a new place,  I settled on chicken enchiladas for dinner with their white queso. I questioned going to this place altogether due to it's unfamiliar location, and while initially questioning my sanity/safety, i have determined their food is DEFINITELY worth dying for :)  One of the ladies i was with raved about their food prior to us arriving, so my expectations were set pretty high. She also mentioned they had good margaritas, and to my pleasant surprise she was right! And, um...hello $2.99!! Their chips were good, their salsa was lacking flavor/spice (IMO), but their white queso was phenom! Perfect amount of flavor and spice. And yes, notice i said WHITE queso. Saw someone else mention they only use yellow cheese. Last i checked, i wasn't color blind. Forgive me, I digress.  The other ladies ordered a bowl of the green chili, and a burro. Didn't try the burro, but it looked/smelled great and the green chili was also a success. To finish things off, we had their fried ice cream with half honey & half strawberry. WOW! First time i've had it, and i'll definitely be going back if only for their $2.99 margaritas and fried ice cream. It really is the small things in life that make us women happy :)  The staff was entertaining, attentive, and polite. My only complaint about my whole experience was that on the menu the enchilada I ordered indicated shredded chicken, and it wasn't. It was chunked/cubed, and in turn made it very "chickeny" (it was STUFFED with Chicken) In addition, it was ALL dark meat. I prefer white meat over anything, but I suppose "to each their own". I think i'll just try a beef or cheese lada next time.  All in all, very good experience, and at the top of my list for best Mexican in the valley!

First i would just like to start this off by saying this is for their service, not for their food, or their lack of even mediocre service which kept me from dining here.  First off, this location is really pretty hard to find...but considering the reviews you yelpers left about the great atmosphere and pretty decent food, i was down for the hunt and excited to try some place new.   When i walked up, i found the place to be pretty hip and a place i would like to try, but INCREDIBLY over-crowded. But again, i figured it was worth the wait and to possibly sit through a dinner touching elbows with a fellow diner. Sometimes you just make the best of it.  However, when first walking up we were greeted...no i take that back, we were interrogated and asked for our ID's.  Really?  Not even a "good evening ladies, welcome to AZ88, may i see your ID's please?"  I mean come on.  I work in customer service too...put on your fake smile and make your way through the night w/o me feeling as though i've become a burden on you. Also, since when do i need an ID to eat a burger? Chili's serves alcohol too and i don't get carded/interrogated when i walk through their doors.  So we show ID's, get the stare down you always get going into a night club, unless your ancient looking that is, and he poorly directed and quietly said they were taking names inside.   Ok, that's great....where do i get inside?  Oh, over there, where people are pouring out at the seems of every inch of the opening, which is by the bar...of course.  i should have known.  After making our way past more than a handful of people waiting, at least with a drink in hand, my friend and i still had NO idea where their podium was to take names for a waiting list.  Well, that would be because they didn't have one! All servers, hostess/host, and busboys were all wearing the same thing, and it was equally as hard to get their attention as it was to tell them apart.   No one was willing to help, the people in that place were beyond stuffy and sloppy...and while i understand it was a Friday night, i left and went to another place not too far from AZ88, waited about 45 min for a table, and would have done that 50 times over because of their pleasant service and down to earth people than ever deal with a place who failed to serve/help me in ANY way.

Still a place that is unacceptable in my book--especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation, and signing off--every so "sincerely" i might add, with: " love the B*tchy waitress from AZ88.  Way to keep it classy over there.....

For everyone's sake of a possible future trip to Sushi Ken, let me just tell you now: dont.  1 star for location--close to home 1 star for clean water glass and not bad tasting tap water total= 2 stars.  Notice there are no stars for their food.  I read a number of reviews before coming here and so many people raved about this being the best Japanese food in the valley...well, i can assure that does NOT include their sushi.  That's all i got (they should probably change their name btw!) and it truly was just bad. Yes, it was edible, but hardly.  Another reviewer mentioned that when getting his rolls he didn't pay attention to them making the rolls because he was eating his miso soup and edamame...well i fell prey to this as well. The first part of my spicy tuna roll was pretty good, but the pieces were overly large (4 of them) compared to the other 4...When i finally reached the other 4 pieces i noticed the consistency changed: the rice was hard and chewy and the tuna was dry and just not appetizing. I also ordered a California roll...the crab was dry, the avacado was brown and again, the rice was hard.  Now, Sir who is "making" my sushi rolls RIGHT in front of me....how many times did you have to sneak each piece over to complete my order without me seeing/knowing? I saw you make my to-go order fresh--as i watched you the entire time. Not cool.  Do yourself a favor and try another sushi place. I can't speak for anything else but their sushi, but i would NOT recommend this place to one single person. Not even a person i hated. And to be quite honest, i feel as though i should take a star away for as awful as i feel right now--i didn't even finish 2 rolls. There is no reason for me to feel this way....just saying.

Irony at its finest. I pulled into the drive thru of this location knowing I would write a review, since everyone knows if you use their drive thru you have time to kill, and I was surprised by how quickly things moved today. The line was fully stacked to the end of the entrance and I managed to make it through to get my 2 drinks and a bagel all by the time I was done writing this review from my phone (about 7 minutes.....minus the extra minute + the girl in front of me took with feeling the need to socialize with an employee in the drive thru line....). Hopefully this is a sign that 20 minute drive through runs are a thing of the past an they will keep this up. For now, 2 stars....keep your butts in gear with less wait time and this location could certainly jump a few stars. Time will tell.

First let me start by saying I love MB...however, this is not a place you want to overindulge yourself in. While the place truly is phenomenal for what it offers, too much too soon and you won't think so highly of it. Then again, this can be said for many places.  Process:  MB has a nice setup as far as ordering/paying is concerned, and you can see everything they are doing (i.e. they aren't spitting in your food!) while you make your way down the line. I will say, however, the communication could be stepped up a notch between the patron and the person making the food. And you're not always acknowledged in a timely fashion--even if you make eye contact. This is not always the case, but i definitely see a trend..  Atmosphere:  I think they have the right idea, but i must admit, when you come in during a busy lunch rush, it's very difficult to maneuver between the tables. I'm not a large person by any means, but not a small on either. It becomes uncomfortable when having to interrupt someone else's lunch/conversation to squeeze by--all while trying not to spill your food/drink....either on yourself or the passerby.  Food:  The food is by far the star of this establishment, and rightfully so. The ingredients are fresh and vibrant and the combination of flavors just seem to work! I've tried all of their salads and love them, and my favorite sammy is the California Turkey. When i first read the description, i didn't know how i felt about it, but trust me when i say...do yourself a favor and order this! It's wonderful.  Have a napkin nearby, though. Their sandwiches are large, topped with generous fillings, and can get a little messy sometimes. Ok--go ahead and make that two napkins to be safe :)  All in all this is a great little place, especially for the surrounding area. It's the perfect combination of upscale meets casual. Bistro is just right.   Keep doing what you're doing MB!

Went to Pearl tonight with my roommate after hearing rave reviews from a few people....  Walking up you can clearly tell it's a hot spot.  It looked busy, and when we walked through the door it was obvious as to why--it's very small.  The tables are super close together so if you're anything bigger than a 6 ladies...go somewhere else, seriously. I had to interrupt the next table at least 3 times in first sitting down in my seat, going to the restroom once/coming back and then leaving for the night.  It was just awkward. They also first sat us outside without even asking which we preferred (inside/out that is)   We had looked at the menu before arriving and was very excited to try a few different things. We got the cucumber salad (very good) and seaweed salad (equally as good-and they dont add lettuce to it to make it look like more), shrimp tempura roll (good) spicy tuna (chunks of tuna were way too big and it just wasn't good), Pearl necklace (far from impressed) and the napolean dynamite (pretty good).....  All in all the sushi filled my stomach but i didn't finish either of my rolls (which is not like me).  I could see coming to this place for drinks and maybe a small plate, but definitely not for a respectable sushi dinner.

This review is for my latest visit to Mido, which was by far the best!  Tonight was my fiance's birthday, and he chose to go to Mido for his sushi fix. Thankfully we managed to go when it wasn't too busy, and we could get a table and not sit at the sushi bar. While the sushi bar is convenient, it's not very private and is cramped.  Anyway, tonight the staff at Mido went above and beyond and I couldn't have chose a better place to experience our night. First of all, knowing every other time we have gone it's been busy and we have to sit at the sushi bar, I called ahead to make sure we could have a table--sure, no problem. Next, however, they did something I thought would have been impossible to explain over the phone-- I requested pre ordered adult beverages be delivered to our table upon arrival, to surprise my fiance for his bday celebration (he's not one to go out of his way to order an adult beverage while we out, so i took the liberty of doing it for him [insert evil laugh here] ) and they did just that...right on queue :)  Ordering and receiving was a breeze as per usual, and everything was fresh and delicious. When it was about time to bring the check, our server attempted to ask if we wanted dessert to celebrate, but fiance was on the phone....next thing we know (he had hung up by this time) disco lights are flashing, Asian techno music sounding similar to happy birthday was playing on a speaker above us, and out came our server with some mango ice cream w/ a candle in it. To top it off, the entire restaurant was clapping and she shot a confetti popper in the air too!   This was by far the best night we've had in such a long time, and we owe it all to Mido! THANKS AGAIN!

Sugarlips, i am a fan. While you're not exactly 5 starts (due to falling short in my much anticipated pink champagne cupcake--it tasted much like play-doh would...) you are almost there with everything else you provided me.  After going to another cake shop, i was very pleased there there was a) more than one person taking orders/making cakes and able to actually serve those who would come in, in a very timely matter b) there were a copious amount of photographs of all of their cakes and c) any questions that one might have was graciously answered without making me feel as though i was an idiot or wasting their time.  It's the first time i'm doing any sort of custom cake.  No sheet cake from the local grocery store, no cake from a box, but a beautiful, tasty, can't stop thinking or talking about kind of cake.  Besides, the one i love deserves it :)  But with that being said, i had no idea where to start on the flavor of cakes.  As i mentioned, i had been to another cake shop and when taking their cupcakes home to try the cake flavors (without having to purchase an entire cake) i was very disappointed. The flavored ones tasted just like white sheet cake. I did the same sampling at Sugarlips, 2 red velvets, 2 pink champagne, and 2 strawberry...I could rave for days about the red velvet and strawberry...not so much on the pink champagne...sorry. But even so...DE-LICIOUS! Most, flavorful, and the coloring was perfect.  After i decided which type of cake flavor i wanted it was back to deciding the design.  They were incredibly helpful with giving me ideas, telling me to do the less colored buttercreme frosting b/c the dye tastes bad, or telling me to do fondant and airbrush instead--just very knowledgeable and i never once felt as though i was being taken advantage of.   Friendly, delicious, creative, and just an overall great vibe!   I will be back Sugarlips!!

My husband and I visited The Keg for the first time last Friday night for a much needed, baby-free date night. We danced around where to go, and ultimately decided here as something "new". I had always heard good things about it, so I was excited to give it a try...and I could not be happier we made that choice!  Service:  I will start here since this is the #1 thing that matters to me in most places, and I was SO happy with it. Our server (Debbie) was polite, pleasant, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. And she was fast. We literally never had to ask for anything. On a Friday night...that's a HUGE bonus! Thank you Debbie!  Drinks: Sadly no cocktails this visit--prego momma and dad was kind enough not to rub it in, so nothing to report here.  Starters: We only tried 1 app since it was just the two of us, and we opted for the calamari. Lightly breaded/fried which was nice, and a surprise accompaniment by some red peppers and jalapeños. While the chili-ginger dipping sauce was good, it's not something i generally think of to pair with calamari, so I didn't use it but for one taste. Instead, I substituted the greek feta sauce (odd dipping choice for calamari don't you think?) for a garlic aioli and then added tabasco--YUM!  **Just note when order apps: they also serve warm bread...i think it was a sourdough. Amazing! Could have eaten the whole thing :)  Dinner:  Call us boring, or call us smart (i'd like to think the latter) but my husband and I ordered the exact same thing. From their summer lobster menu we got the Steak and 1/2 Lobster. Not 1/2 lobster TAIL...an entire 1/2 of a lobster! It was really decently priced, and that lobster was actually fresh, not frozen, unlike the tails serve off of their regular menu. The 6 and 8 oz steaks were decent sized and truly cooked to perfection; although they did mix up our steaks on who got what size--they were cooked appropriately and my husband sacrificed some extra meat for our growing kid haha.   The lobster was UN-REAL! So sweet, very easy to remove surprisingly, and despite eating my steak first, was still really warm when it was time to eat.  We both got the veggie medley as our accompaniment, and while a good selection of veggies, they were a little undercooked for my liking. Just barely not raw. But, with a little of the butter sauce from the lobster it was manageable :)  The only downside I would say is the parking. The parking available immediately next to the restaurant is always full. And while the rest of the "mall" parking isn't too far from the location, on a hot summer night when you're pregnant...not a huge fan haha.

A solid 4 stars for my first time in.  Ordered take out (for pick up) and was very happy with my service, timeliness, and of course, taste.  I have tried several places in the Ahwatukee area for Chinese and have always left disappointed. My go to place became Panda, which is never a place you want as your "go to" Chinese location...not for me anyway.  Flavor was great, and i LOVED that the chicken was all white meat, and I didn't have to request it.   I will bump this place to 5 stars if their hot and sour soup is just right. Stay tuned for an update at a later time.

Still a solid 4 stars in my book.  Ordered hot and sour soup last night and it was just OK. It was very brothy, and not as dark as most hot and sour soups. I suppose when thinking of my health, this is a great thing, but it just lacked in consistancy and the flavor was a bit odd. It had a great little kick to it, which you don't often find in hot and sour soups--so good job in that regard.

I just wanted to start off with this review since there is only one other person who seems to have yelped about them. I am planning a trip to Vegas in the upcoming weeks and little did i know you could find and pay for parking online (i love the internet). I found Fasttrack on another website which was actually trying to charge more money than Fasttrack's website, so be sure to go to theirs directly. They offer covered as well as uncovered for as low as $6.40 a day (uncovered) and also have occasional coupons. Although i have yet to arrive and fully experience this company and its service in full-force, i would have to say that the rates are more than reasonable, and the fact that i can reserve, as well as pay in advance online and print out my confirmation ticket showing i've paid, has made me a very happy camper. I'm definitely a planner...so the fact that this is one thing scratched off my list i will give it 5 stars. Should i come across anything negative within the company/service, i will make the appropriate adjustment to the rating and keep you guys informed with an update after my trip.  Don't let me down Fasttrack! :)

I completely forgot that i yelped about this place...oops!  Just thought i would update you all and say that i had no troubles with this place what so ever. Very friendly drivers both to and from the airport and i was in and out super quick!  I will say it's not the nicest of the places on the strip of airport parking, but i would definitely use it again :o)

Really, this review is an "update" but Yelp removed my earlier review because I called a crappy server out by name. The good news: during my recent visit I confirmed this server no longer works here and my experience was far superior.   EXPERIENCE (past): I decided to give this place another try after spending years avoiding it after my terrible experience when it first opened: I went out on a limb and took my father here for dinner--who was in from out of town--based on other Yelp reviews. Sadly, the food fell short, and the service TERRIBLE. When a co-worker suggested this location for lunch, while hesitant, i agreed.  EXPERIENCE (update): Clearly my earlier experience was a mixture of "just opened" jitters and a server who had no business serving me. I was pleasantly surprised with the lunch experience (i still have to go back for dinner...) and everything about this go around certainly created urgency to come back.  FOOD: The calamari and shrimp appetizer was good--nothing special, the baby spinach salad was delicious--not over dressed and fresh ingredients, and the french press coffee and the pear/apple tart was divine!! I would go there to sip their french press and eat that dessert any day...seriously, so good.  SERVICE: The service was impeccable. Our server was informative, so friendly, and was very attentive--wasn't at our table too much or too less. The fact that I never had to prompt my server for a refill was amazing. This doesn't happen very often in my experience. I would call him out by name, but would hate for this POSITIVE review to be removed by the Yelp folk :)  All in all, a very solid lunch experience. Don't disappoint me at dinner, though. I'll be back :)

My hopes for this place were high, and I was sadly let down.  1 star- Location:  It was within a decent drive to the house for what I hoped it would have promised.   1 star- Decor/Atmostphere/music: It was very eclectic and i liked it. Lighting was right, visually appealing, music was playing (decent tunage) and not too loud.  My intentions were to try a few things on the menu, and to try a few different wines. I had relatives in from out of town, and thought it might be nice to take them out to a new place that was different than their normal restaurant experience. Ever since moving to Phoenix, I've seen a trend in unique dining experiences, and wanted to share.  I suppose I might be a little partial, seeing as how my go-to place for a similar atmostphere/menu choice (when i lived in Scottsdale) was Postinos. But since the drive is now much further, I was hoping it was at least comparable.  Nevertheless, the wine that was recommended wasn't even what we were looking for. The waitress openly admitted to being a beer drinker, but liked wine (after she saw our face from our first sip), and failed to deliver with her choices. While i respect the honesty of your lack of knowledge, don't recommend a wine to me please. Just say you're unfamiliar with the selection, but would happy to find someone who is--and sincerely ASK!  From there we ordered the bruschetta, as i was excited to share in this also. My family is Italian, and the type of bruschetta we're used to is nothing like what is offered here, so they were in for a treat.....or so i had hoped.  When our food arrived, it was visually appealing, but as soon as I picked it up i was disappointed--without having even tasted it. The bread was limp, and lacking a crust/crunch of any sort, and the slices were thin. Sandwich bread anyone?  In turn, they had piled the toppings on. Yes, on bread that was incapable of holding the toppings. The flavors were bland, and it was a messy/soggy situation. At that point we chose to ask for our check and go elsewhere. We blamed it on the limited menu that didn't fit all of the guest appetite....but there were obviously other issues.   I truly wish things had been different, but I will not be going back.  Oh, and PS. This was very much an older crowd when i was there. Since i've only been there once, i can't vouch for what the average age group is, but if you're in your 20's....I would advise finding something a little less "We're trying WAY too hard to be hip and cool".   That is all.

Hands down my favorite sub place...their italian sub reminds me how they make it back home (Chicago). Simple, clean ingredients , fresh meat an cheeses and great bread.   If you're complaining about wanting less oil/vinegar then speak up. I actually ask for extra. Same goes for wanting less/more of other toppings.   Staff is fast and friendly and I will always choose this place before any other of given the choice.

**Please Note--This location has MOVED. They are now located at 4206 E Chandler Blvd.  This is between Secreto and C.K.s**  Also, if you don't read anything else from this review, the bottom line is: I loved everything about my experience (service, skill, PRICE, atmosphere, & personality!)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, after finally finding their new location I wondered in for a gel manicure, hoping that I would have a good experience considering I had not been to this location before. From what i remember of their old location (by Target) it wasn't very appealing. Their new spot is gorgeous, is well laid out and is extremely inviting!  I also had the pleasure of getting to interact with a lot of their staff, as I was in there as soon as they opened, and their personalities alone would keep me coming back. I mean lets be honest ladies (and gentlemen), what nail salon do you go to where you can have a full-on enjoyable conversation with your nail tech? They spoke TO me, and not ABOUT me to other staff members haha.   Anyway...their work was nothing short of a delight as well. I had the fastest, most proficient gel manicure ever. They don't mess around there haha. I was so impressed with their service that I decided to book appointments for myself and a few others for my upcoming wedding.  At the very least, give this place a try. I surely hope you all have the same fantastic experience I did :)

Curvy girls unite and rejoice!  This place is spectacular. Everything about it is comforting, welcoming, hip, stylish, and so much more. The staff and owner are top notch and make you feel so comfortable and at ease while shopping for a girls most important piece of clothing in her life!   First of all, i called VERY last minute to see about an appointment. They were able to fit me in very soon. ++ for that. When I arrived, they made me and my MOH feel very welcome and asked questions about what I was looking for, and what price range I wanted to be in. This made me feel at ease because the last place I went didn't bother to ask how much, or little, I wanted to spend on a dress. I described the dress I was envisioning and off they went. 5 minutes later (or less??) they swooped me into the dressing room to try on 4 dresses. There was one gown in there that I hadn't described, and it was so unique looking that I got anxious when it was finally time to try it on. It wasn't like anything I had described...they had chosen this piece all on their own.   I put on the dress and had my moment and without hesitation, said yes to that dress! The one I had no hand in picking. It was, and still is, a great feeling to know how well they picked up on me as a bride to be able to find a dress that perfect!   I'm so glad Ann and Stephanie were there to assist me on my dress journey, especially after some not-so-great run ins with other bridal stores.   If you are size 12 +, do yourself a favor and try this place. If you don't feel like a true "plus size" girl (just like me), set aside your phobia of the dress size and go to find a dress that you will love more than ever. You deserve to feel, and look, great on your special day. I know i will.  Good luck!

I don't eat cake (or cupcakes) very often, but when I do I would expect better than what I experienced at Cupcakes by Design...especially for $3.50 for ONE cupcake.   They are visually nice. Simple and not too much frosting. In my book, frosting is the side in this main meal...the cake. There's no need to overdue it, because i'm just going to take most of it off. Anyway. The frosting left much to be desired...and after tasting the cake, I wish the frosting had something more to help me choke down the cake.   The cake lacked moisture, and was overbaked in some areas (old oven maybe?) and it just wasn't delicious at all. I went for the salted caramel cupcake, hoping it would knock my socks off. Welp...my socks are still there...nowhere close to hitting the floor. It was filled with this brown goo that tasted nothing like caramel, and the consistency was wrong too. What was this exactly?  Now, normally i don't disect my cupcakes, but after being told these were the best cupcakes in the valley, I felt the need to taste every part of these in order to accept this statement. After tasting each part seperately (frosting, cake, filling) I lumped them all together and was STILL disappointed.  I'm sorry Cupcakes by Design, but you just didn't cut it for me this time. I'll try you one last time in hopes that I received a bad batch.  Until then....

I park here at least a few times a month, and I just love it. I've only had to wait a while once, and that was when the airport changed which door shuttles were allowed to pick up at in terminal 4--after 20 minutes, i called and the informed me of the change. Not their fault.  Nevertheless. They are always quick, friendly, and their structure is nice, clean and secure. I also love the fact that I can schedule online and pre-pay...i'm always in and out without any troubles at all.   I would absolutely recommend this location to everyone needing to park long or short term--especially if coming from the east valley.

When I first dropped off my 10week old preemie, who was born 6weeks premature and realistically only 4 weeks old...I was a nervous wreck. But I remembered the countless daycares I interviewed before my baby's arrival and I felt an instant connection with this school.   After attending for almost 2 years now and witnessing staff turnover, which most turned out to be for the best, I could not be more grateful to PCA and their staff. While I can only speak to the infant and now toddler classes, my daughter has done nothing but thrive. While we faced a few challenges, after speaking to the school about our concerns they happily worked with us to find a solution that made us comfortable. Sometimes I'm "that mom", but they have never made me feel bad or weird for it.   The school is bright, clean, friendly, and I love that they teach sign language starting so young. They also provide meals as they get older and for a busy mom of 2, this makes my life so much easier. Our youngest will be attending as a new infant soon, and I am very comforted in knowing he will be in good hands here.

My boyfriend and I ended up here on an early Saturday afternoon after our favorite sushi place let us down with their inconsistent hours.....again....and since we were scheduled for a house showing nearby, we decided to try something else in the area.   I do believe, once upon a time, I stumbled upon this establishment in search of some better, close-to home Mexican offerings, b/c lets be honest--Arriba's is nothing special--however, i don't recall seeing such a positive review for this place so i was a little skeptical to go against my fellow yelpers, and to trust my boyfriends "better" judgement.   Nevertheless, we arrived and were promptly greeted and brought to our table. Granted, they had just opened, so it's not like they were doing much else. I was a little taken back with their menu, as i truly expected menu items such as what you'd see at every generic Mexican restaurant...and their pricing was a little higher than expected....i admit, i was a little curious, and slightly ready to walk out b/c me and new things, well, lets just say we're not well acquainted.   Now, if I weren't in a good mood, i'd take away a star for the lack of communication skills our server had, outside of telling us their food is "hot"....later confirming, he means spicy hot AND temperature hot. Great...because a) i don't like cold food, and b) i suppose it's always good to know things are naturally hot before dumping extra salsa on my food for some extra heat. WHEW! I digress....  So here's how it went  -waters to drink (I was fighting a cold...so i can't speak of their bar tending skills....although i will say i was delightfully surprised with their selection and overall decor. very nice)  - chips & salsa: chips weren't soggy/greasy, were warm & had nice flavor while the salsas were kickin' with heat and very flavorful....and most importantly, didn't like as though it came from a jar!  -boyfriend ordered chicken enchilada and added green chili, and i ordered a blue corn tamale with some weird named spicy pork that i don't remember: both were ordered a la carte, and were sized exceptionally well. I don't know how people could make either of those a combo with rice and beans, because i struggled with one measly tamale. But don't let it stop you from trying!  I whole heartedly was blown away with the amount of flavors that came pouring into my mouth with this tamale. Even with a cold i could taste them, and the spiciness was there without being too intense that you couldn't enjoy the meal.   boyfriends had cheese, so I couldn't try any and fill you in, but his empty plate and constant praise is a HUGE indication. And because none of you know him, let me just tell you, he NEVER raves about food...ever.   We will definitely be going back, maybe for dinner and add some cocktails just to see how much game this place really has. But give it a shot...i'm glad i did!

I'm not sure how long this location has been here, but since finding out about it a few weeks ago, i've been there twice.  This is definitely a place to go to when you want some quick, cheap, great tasting sushi. This is a no-fuss place. It's clean, and small, and you can get in and out quickly.   While i am a fan of this place, i don't recommend it for date night--just not that type of atmosphere.   Happy Hour prices are great, but even regularly priced menu items are far better priced than any other local spot i've found--with the great taste to go with it!  I definitely recommend giving this place a chance!
