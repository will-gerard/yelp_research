Wowed and all SMILES!  This place hands down had an amazing combination of quality service, superior staff, and an unforgettable atmosphere.  The moment you walk in the door you are happily greeted by basically everyone working there.  Its very pleasant and I was a bit skeptical about the sincerity of it.  It only took a few min to observe that everyone working here was genuinely happy to have you as a customer.  Some of the sushi chefs are shouting jokes with the customers and staff and everyone, including customers, are laughing.  This was so odd to me but it made for and EXTREAMLY enjoyable dinner.  I had a great time, so did the rest of the customers.  The fish portions are very generous here.  The sushi had a clean taste with just the right amount of delicate flavoring.  Some of the best I've tried...period!    I highly recommend this place and I will be back for more.  I really did leave with a smile =)

Pure Bliss - I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.    The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent.   You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.     I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (I've tried at least 5 others).

Dry/Reheated:  I kid you not I walked in after the lunch rush and ordered a few slices of pepperoni pizza, the guy (without washing his hands after taking the money) walks to some left over lunch cheese pizza sitting on a counter tosses some pepperoni on it and chucks it back into the oven.  This pizza looked like it had been out for a few hours and it tasted like it did too (yes I bit into it against my basic instinct...I was hungry!).  Needless to say I didn't finish it, the two men at the front counter were not at all friendly in any way and I felt like I was interrupting break-time when I ordered my slice.    I didn't feel "Italian" anything from this restaurant setting or menu.

Must Stop for CG - This is a unique caf√© and by far one of my favorites in Casa Grande.    First and foremost the food has a very thoughtful flavor to it.  What the hell dose that mean?! Well when you take a bite you can really tell someone took time to make your meal with pride and heart.  They do this one meal at a time and it shows.    I absolutely love that this establishment supports the working Autistic Community.  You can tell a lot of heart goes into many things there that normally would be overlooked at many other places.    My favorite is lunch time.  The sandwiches are generously sized and the salads are fresh and well complimented by the homemade dressings.   If your in a mega lunch rush this isn't always your quickest stop, but if you have a few to spare its very much worth your time.

Mammas Pancake Breakfast - Extra Crispy Bacon with one more over easy egg and your SET.  Nothing more left to say other than this is my first choice for a yummy Hotcake breakfast.

Everything here just seemed so very dry to me.  Like it was mass prepared a few days ago and they reheat it, put sauce on it and serve it.  The sushi felt the same way somehow.

Horrible Pet Care.  As an animal lover I want the best care for my loved ones at all times.  I felt like I was in a used car lot by the time I left this place.  The vet was smug and uninterested in my pets concerns.  Their primary concern was up-selling unnecessary tests and products.  Literally 2 min was spent on examining the actual pet and 45 min was spent trying to sell me very expensive dog food and random blood tests that I felt were only a rue to get more money out of me.  Total estimated bill was going to be $300 with these up-sells.  Instead of explaining to me that my dog may have a lack of fiber in her diet and showing me ways I could improve that, the nurse was sent back 3 times while I waited in a room with my sick dog to try and sell me $75 dog food with fiber in it.  The dog has arthritis and has been taking medication for that for 3 years now.  The vet would not renew this medication unless I spent $150 additional money to run extra tests on top of the $100 visit I was already expected to pay.  This was my first visit and it will be my last, drive your pet into the Phx area for a quality experience.

Went there yesterday for some yard plants.  I know this is no big surprise to most people, but the garden staff was very rude (like most home depot staff here).  Its almost like they hate there job so much they want you to hate coming to Home Depot so they don't have to work......its working.

I'm always looking for a good slice of pizza/italian.  Casa Grande doesn't have many choices.  When I first past by this place I thought - eh what the hell.  You walk in and its a bit dark, a few people lingering at the bar, EVERYONE stares at you like an alien when you walk in.  Very strange, must be a very clickly hangout for the older folk I guess.  Any who....I ordered the spaghetti because its an original recipe. Well it was crap, no really, the noodles were dry, stuck together, and the sauce was so bland and basic that I wondered if it was just a can of tomato sauce and some salt.     To top it off the waitress was trying to pitch me a sale on a "special price" flat screen tv (which they sell in here) with direct TV (which is also sold here).  Seriously.  I dunno, never been back never plan to.

Hmmm I'm gonna trrrrrry and be nice with this one.    You know those Grease Pit diners of the 60s n 70s?  Ya those one's with decent tasing food only because every single item on the menu was drenched in grease or butter.  Its kinda like that here.    The food was okay tasting, I had the Chorizo and Eggs, but I can't help but wonder how many morning runs its going to take in order to lose the fat ass I surely got after that breakfast.    Service on the other hand, well like those diners of the past that are still around they are typically full of "regulars" and so there is hardly a need for actual service from the wait-staff.  Between 4 of us waving down the 2 waitresses working, we managed to get both of their attention after about 5 minutes and only one bothered to come 5 min later to refill our drinks (in the other's defense after she took our order she went on a morning break, sat down and was eating breakfast -_-).  Those of you boldly daring to venture into the thrilling and endlessly exciting town of Casa Grande....stick to the chain breakfast eateries for now if your thing is standard service and digestible food.

We were referred here by All Pets Great and Small Pet Cremation Service.  We had to put down a 15 1/2 year old Lab (Kelly).  Unfortunately I have had to do this before so I have somewhat of a basis of comparison for experience.  They did not rush me and that was very important to me.  I actually took Kelly for a little walk around the building and had some alone time with her.  There was a private room with two rocking chairs that provided a very private and quite place.  The doctors and staff were very friendly and understanding.  No one was pushy.  Everything was clearly explained to us.  At the end there was a private back door we left through which had a small path on the side of the building with pet memorials.    I really appreciate this Caring Hearts Animal Clinic for creating an atmosphere that helps people grieve in private and at their own pace.  This mean a lot to us.

A PERFECT marriage between Party On & Bottom Of the Barrel.  First experience here reminded me of what happens to us all after a few too many to drink.  A friend wanted to show me out and suggested this location to end the night after 2a.m. Lets just say the cab didn't get far before I got back in.  It was a mix of 'clicks' still dancing the night away surrounded by the hopefuls and out of shape-late 40 something's preparing to pounce at the first sight of a wounded gazelle.  Looks like I better try this place out once more under different circumstances as the previous reviews show it may have  potential.

Clean, Friendly, and well organized!  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Everyone was so friendly to me and I felt well informed.  I was instantly 'Wowed' when I walked in.  It was a beautiful building.  Its wonderful to see a collaborated  effort for such a good cause from so many caring people.  Although I did not find that special someone on my visit I know I will be back.

I think this is a fantastic stop for happy hour appetizers, sushi, and casual drinks.   Everything was very tasty and portioned well enough to share!   You can sit outside and the service was friendly and attentive.  I really enjoyed myself here.

Memorable, Quick, and Inexpensive.  Perfect for lunch goers or that quick dinner pick up on the way home.    I try as many Sushi Bars as I can come across and this one over many others just stands out by FLAVOR alone.  Mix that in with the low prices  and you have a winner!

4 days to Burritoholic!  It all stared 4 days ago....just like any other ordinary day.  Someone mentioned I should check out this burrito place in lue of my usual.  I say, hey why not right.....wrong!!!!  Dam you Chipotle, dam you and your YUMMY food!  Monday was testing the waters, Tuesday was making some adjustments, Wednesday was fine tuning the little things, and Thursday I had it down to a science.  Oh ya, 4 days in a row for lunch.  Need I say more?

This lady must have just been dumped this morning right after she ran over her cat, just before she was told her winning lottery ticket was no longer valid....how can I tell?  Um my raw sore feet pretty much say it all.  I could have sworn when I got home there would be blood on my socks.  Ohhhhh ya, she was NUTS.  Firstly, she was very unpleasant and I guessed she probably didn't normally do Pedicures.  This is a pet peeve of mine in a service based business, ESPECAILLY, in a down economy.  If you don't like what your doing don't do it and if you can't help that DON'T take it out on the paying customer who keeps you employed.    Normally I relax and study or read while I'm getting this done.  I was on full guard the whole time.  She was gazing out the window grinding aggressively away....like if she could only get to to bone her BF would give it another go...i dunno, I had to pull away finally and tell her enough.    And regarding sanitation....um I didn't even think these nail places did this anymore since all the bad rep a while back....but after she was done with the tools she dipped them quickly in the dirty foot water and placed them back in a container for the next customer.....(I'm cringing at the thought).  I'm used to a freshly sealed sanitized grouping of tools for every customer.    Strike this one off the list.  Let all hope for me that I don't end up with some sort of infection....(ya it was really that bad).   (YES I get basic pedicures. Nobody wants to see chapped hooves in flip-flops and no one wants them brushing up against their legs at night or so I'm told haha)

Dirty floor, filthy salsa bar, gastly restrooms.  I'm thinking this place is over due for an inspection *nudge *nudge  Look past all that, get your food and it was so-so.  I was over expecting due to the extreme yelps.    To each there own right, maybe it was just hard to enjoy the meal with all the screaming kids & parents that hardly noticed.  Or the messy setting.  We'll never know.

I went a few days ago to test the waters out.  I sometimes live in a box and had never heard of "Crossfit" before.  I've worked out in a traditional gym environment all my life and am currently seeking something to mix it up a bit.  Matt (one of the co-owners) gave me a great introduction of the facility and concept behind "Crossfit".  I left feeling fully informed on what I could expect if I decided to join their program.  He was friendly and energetic.  I was on the tail end of a long day and probably could have been a bit more excited rather than so tired.   I would generalize this as a "Burst-Workout" if I could pick a description.  Try to do as much as you can in the least amount of time.  Its a very unique angle to approach fitness in my opinion.  I could see a benefit in training like this to many degrees.    I would highly suggest this training for:  Pre-Academy Fire Fighters Military Prep Triathlon Conditioning  I have absolutely no doubts that if you train here first you will be more than ready to pursue an aggressively fit demanding career or challenge.  As for me personally it was too intense.  My days are too long to summon the energy needed for these types of workouts.  Although in a parallel universe where I'm 5 years younger and I had less to focus on I'd be there every day!

Ok lets just put it out there.  If your in charge of the entertainment committee and you take your group here your going to end up fired.  I sadly found this out first hand.    Unless you have a genuine interest in dirt and mud castles this is going to hit the "Boiled Cabbage" mark on the rector-scale of excitement.   I mean no disrespect to the heritage and history behind this place.  Personally the history review and time-line inside the facility caught my interest more than the actual park.  It is amazing what this group of people accomplished with very limited resources.  But again, if you have kids or a group of people really excited to do something thrilling, your going to lose your brownie points here.  Also in my opinion the cost is a bit steep for a group etc.  $5 a person for aprox 15-20 min of something to do.  Side note:  Archaeologists please don't throw rocks at me for this review.

FORGOTTEN...  Nothing too memorable about the setting, music, or people there.  I went for the first time on a sat night with some friends.  It was pretty empty given the large space.  As for the actual bar it had a Hip Hop section with tables and an open bar, a "techno/dance" room (void of any actual people), and an outdoor patio which was small and a bit crowded but housed all of the smokers for efficient second hand smoke intake.

Now this is a place I really enjoyed.  Very relaxing in so many ways.  I sat outside, enjoyed the comfy chairs, and finished up a good book while I waited for my pizza.    I had the Chicken & Spinach Pizza and it was clean, grease free, and very very good.  Top that off with good atmosphere and a glass of wine and I was set.  The personal-sized pizzas are not overwhelming and I didn't feel like a blob on my way out the door.      For all you dieters out there, this would make a great cheat meal....*nudge *nudge

Regardless of this review there is an obvious lack of options in the area and it will continue to be a busy business.  But perhaps someone will consider there is still a whole lot of room for improvement and do something about it!  I have yet to come to this location and leave feeling like I had great service.  I feel forgotten at my table and my drink is always empty.  Tonight's dinner was no different.  I ordered the Never Ending bowl of pasta with chicken.  *The chicken was very fatty and I had to spit out chunks of fat a few times. *My pasta was runny and mushy.   *I hardly finished any of the first bowl to even want a second.  I asked for the check 3 times and it took the server close to 15 min to get a manager to bring it over.  When he asked about my meal and I told him he didn't seem to care one bit about my reply.  Why he asked I have no idea.  Overall I feel like this franchise location needs some serious work from the "big guys".

Very pricy, food isn't very memorable.  Basic Italian meal with nothing to rave about.  Atmosphere seemed slapped together in a few days and dose not at all reflect the pricing on the menu or service.

I was really impressed by how much time the doctor took out of his day to sit and explain his methods and procedures.  I went in there pretty blind to the whole process and I had a lot of questions.  He answered every single one with no pressure to proceed.  The office was clean and progressive.  I very much liked that on the patient medical information form there was a "Partner" box to check. Its nice to see people with innovative alternative medical methods practicing this idea in all aspects of their business.    This office houses 3 doctors I believe.  Each specializing in something.  They also work closely with a chiropractor which I plan to call this week.  I will be back over the next month at least 3 more times.  I will follow up with progression.

Service is wonderful and the food is even better.  In a small city like Casa Grande this is a 'must stop' for casual lunches and dinners.  Everything is flavorful, slowly prepaired, but well worth the wait.  Try a Meaty Callazzo its AMAZING.

2 Thumbs Up on Customer Service:  I ordered my window coverings with Louis and she was the most pleasant person I have ever encountered in a franchised store.  She was attentive, patient, suggestive, and genuinely happy to help me in the week-long process it took me to pick out the right cover for each window in the house.  I can tell she enjoys her job and what she does.  She followed up and kept me informed throughout the entire process.   They always have my business with employees like this.

Ok so I narrowed down the two types of Rubio's for you guys.  The one's that grill your meal fresh as you order it and the one's that grab what they grilled hours ago and feed it to you.    This location was worth a squawk because my Baja Grilled Chicken Burrito was fresh made and always is every time I visit.  Its clean all the time, even during lunch rush.  I hate when you can find an available table in these places but not a clean one.      So among the many locations  out there this one won't leave you wanting 3 cups of liquid and a refund.  Enjoy!

Cookies Cookies Cookies!  I dropped in for lunch yesterday for the first time.  I had pure intentions of a healthy and well balanced meal......One of each cookie and a cup of yogurt and granola later I had so much sugar that it was hard to stand still for the rest of the day!  They each had a very unique flavor and that original recipe taste.  The granola was delicious with just the right crunch.   Very clean, and friendly service.  Now I that I got the goodies out of the way I'll have to go back for an actual meal.

On Friday I spent my day at Jurlique Spa in Scottsdale.  It was my first day off in a long time and I was excited to spend it relaxing.  This was a 65 mile drive for me and my visit totaled $245.00 (that was the half off price).  I know its taboo to list prices but I think its relevant to this review because its no small chunk of change for anyone in today's economy.  I needed a few days to cool down before I wrote this review.  Jurlique opened their business to the yelp community and offered half off on their services.  For this alone I am grateful.  As I walked in I was greeted by a very pushy and "cold" receptionist. I was very rushed by her.  She didn't introduce me to the establishment or befriend me as a new customer.  It was go go go.  Following this, I was on a rapid assembly line by the rest of the staff.  They started me off with the Signature Harmony Massage.  This was literally a gewfest of rushed body oiling and back pinching.  The pressure was light to medium but more light.  This would have been nice to know prior to agreeing to the massage.  I workout and I have knots, deep ones, that require some pressure other than light surface friction.  I mentioned this but either she was unable to increase the pressure or she was very adamant about doing the specific massage.  She was also very very nervous.  Its difficult to explain but she just was.  I don't think she has done many male massages.  She was a very nice girl but the massage was horrible.  It had no rhythm or flow. Nothing about this "massage" was relaxing and I felt like all I got for my time and money was half a bottle of scented oil.  Next was the Intense Recovery Facial.  This was done very well by Lindsey.  She made an intelligent effort to get to know my skin patterns and truly adapted her treatment for my skin. She was confident and had a very good work ethic.  I could tell that she knew her craft well.  This included: exfoliating washes, steaming, painful but necessary extractions, a great mask, and lots of moisturizing.  When she was finished I looked like someone pushed me into a gravel pit....and I couldn't be more thrilled.  It's a good sign of a good facial, it is!  Had this been my only experience here the over all review would have been much better.  (My skin looks great this Monday morning!)  To finish off my day I had Jurlique's Wildflower Pedi.  I get Pedi's on a regular bases and I have never in my life paid $70 for one but I was looking forward to seeing what I've been missing out on.  At half off this regular price I couldn't resist!  I'm not going to get into too much detail about this experience because there is none. The water was scented and that's about the only nice thing I can say about it.   The primary reason for my pedicures is to keep the bottom of my feet smooth and healthy.  I noticed in Yoga yesterday that I need to make time this week to get an actual pedicure.  -Sigh  At the end of my visit the receptionist added the 20% mandatory gratuity (which should just be a called a fee of $70) to my bill and didn't ask me if I wanted to add more ( I would have liked to tip extra for the facial).  The bill had no place to add an extra tip.  This really bothered me.  I don't understand what the target audience is for this Spa.  Its not men under 30.  Don't forget Jurlique we have money to spend too.  I suggest that Jurlique take a step back and evaluate their quality of services.  Just because its in Scottsdale and just because its expensive dose not excuse you from striving for consistent quality for every customer.  In a down-economy, where services like this are becoming a rare luxury again, many places are offering a better experience for a fraction of the cost.  If your going to keep your prices up there you better WOW each and every customer that walks in that door.

Very very impressed with the over all service I received from this Grooming experience for my dog!   I expressed my dislike for PetsMart grooming due to the fact that my pet is often there 5-8 hours past the time I was scheduled for - they listened.  First of all this place is very clean, simple, and organized.  The staff is friendly and attentive and answered all my questions very patiently.  As I watched them groom other pets I had a sense that these people genuinely enjoyed their job.  I had a 10 a.m. appointment and my dog was ready for pick up before 12 noon.  I was extremely impressed by this.  My dog wasn't in distress, he smelled clean, looked fresh, and his haircut was the best I've ever seen.  Count me in for the long term!

Been here 1 1/2 hours (with an appointment) for my first oil change. I was just informed that the "technicians" were just getting started on my car and that it would be a "while". The first oil change for my brand new car is also not free. The buying experience was better here than other dealerships. The lack of equal experience at the service-end is concerning.  Hyundai is aggressively trying to build customer assurance in their product, as well they should be given their past reputation. With a poor service experience they are failing to do just that.  My time is valuable and a 2+ hour simple oil change, that will cost more than if I had gone to a common competitor, is not acceptable.  Buyer be warned.

I would say I've eaten here about 5-8 times now.  I get the Grilled Italian Sub and I LOVE IT.    Yes, its a lot of change to spare for a sandwich but one large sub is easily shareable and they are loaded quality tasting meats.    The customer service has always been exceptional.  The tables and restrooms are clean.    Not many business give the persona that they actually want to please there customers, but here I really do get that impression.  Try it out once, order yourself a Grilled Italian Sub and you won't regret a single calorie or penny!

STRETCHY PANTS ARE A MUST HAVE before going here, once you start eating this good food its going to be difficult to stop!  The best Italian food I have experienced in this city thus far!  Without being clich√© you MUST try the Rigatoni Signature Dish (I get mine with chicken) the only thing you'll regret after this is your waste size!   Authentic flavors dish after dish and I've tried many.  It's a warm place with nice staff.
