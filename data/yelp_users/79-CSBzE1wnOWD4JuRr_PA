Food was okay for bar food, and my french dip was good.  The service, however, was horrible.  I had lunch on a weekend with a buddy and I only noticed one server for the entire place (not counting the bartender).  It took us about 45 minutes from when we ordered to when we got our food and the place wasn't busy.  It also took a long time to order another beer and our check.  I don't think I will ever go back.

This place has a good small town feel to it as it reminds me of places in the Midwest.  I've been here about 4-5 times and the food has always been incredible.  The sandwich that stands out to me was the "No Bones About It Chicken" sandwich, which was a breaded chicken sandwich with hot wing sauce.  You could tell the bread was homemade and fresh as it was soft.  This sandwich is incredible and very flavorful!  Definitely a favorite if you enjoy chicken wings as I do.  The "Goat Cheese Bruschetta" is delicious as well.  I've seen the pizzas and have heard a lot of good things about them, but have yet to try one.    The staff here are all very friendly and nice.  This is definitely one of my favorite places to grab a sandwich in the Gilbert area.  It is a little small but I've never really had to wait.

I took a date here as we both heard good things about it and both of us were craving wine and pizza. We ordered the Marcello (mozzarella, garlic, tomatoes, Parmesan) and the Vegetariana (mozzarella, provolone, caramelized onions and roasted red peppers). We both agreed that the pizzas were just okay, nothing great. It didn't have a lot of flavor and not enough toppings. It wouldn't come close to my top ten pizza places in the city. The restaurant was cool as there were a lot of places to sit outside as well as in. The wine selection was pretty decent as well.   Not a fan of the food but maybe I went on an off night. I plan on giving it another shot and possibly order a different pizza with more toppings.

I've been to this place a couple of times for dinner and lunch and it never lets me down.  The Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Saag are my favorite dishes and some of the best Indian food in Phoenix.  I just wish they had more options for lunch specials!  Some people would say the dinner is a bit overpriced, but it feels you up and the flavors are worth it.  I will definitely keep coming back.

This was my first visit for breakfast and I will definitely be coming back.  I had the Crack O' Dawn, which was a potato skillet with diced ham, fresh mushrooms, onions and melted cheese with two eggs on top.  It also came with an english muffin.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly and the dish had good chunks of ham.  It was excellent!  They also had homemade cinnamon/apple jam on the table to use, which I did, and it was also delicious.  My girlfriend had the Hilltop Acres, which was also a potato skillet with more vegetables than mine, but minus the ham.  She loved the flavor and the potatoes.  However, even though she is a cheese lover, she thought it was a little too much.  I noticed our neighbors ordered the french toast and that looked incredible.    Service was great, staff was attractive, and will be going back soon to try the french toast.

I have been going to the original location in Phoenix for the past 7 years so I was excited they opened up a location in Chandler. I can't believe some yelpers commented on the decor. This isn't, and never has been, a place you are going to bring your date to and order a bottle of wine at the table. It also isn't a place you are going to ask for the "low fat, low calorie" dish. Chino's is a fast food place with folding tables, no servers, your meal comes in a tin throwaway plate, plastic silverware, and plastic cups. You go for the food, which combines Mexican and Chinese flavors for an incredible taste! It may not sound like it would be good, but it is and it's worth checking out.   Good points:  The combination of Mexican and Chinese dishes is incredible to say the least!  If it is your first time at Chino's, you can ask to sample the dishes for free. I highly recommend this so you won't be surprised on what you order.  You always receive a free Snicker doodle (always freshly baked that day) cookie or a Volcano (chocolate fudge cookie on weekends).  You can create your own meal with a lot of different dishes rather than just ordering one dish.   Bad points:  Only a few; the Chandler location is somewhat hard to find if you have never been there. It's tucked back in behind the Walgreens. Not that big of a deal as long as you know where you are going.  It can be a bit confusing when ordering (you fill out a small form) but just ask for help when you get there.   The dish I always order is the following: Hengrenade Chicken (go with the Pollo Diablo if you are looking for some kick) in a homemade quesadilla, a side of Jade Red Chicken (my favorite and most popular), a side of black beans (they blend the beans with other flavors in a soupy consistency, so don't expect anything different, and these are VERY good.) with Jerk Fried Rice. This is all around $10 with a drink and will fill you up, especially with the free cookie.   This is one of my favorite places to eat for a good, gut busting meal. Give the stone Mexican panda in the restaurant a little touch for good luck.
