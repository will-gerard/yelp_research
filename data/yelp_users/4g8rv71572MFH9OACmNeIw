This is a great place to go in the morning or late at night after partying.  I will forever enjoy going to this place because it reminds me of truck stop food while traveling.  The hungry traveller will always fill you up with bottomless pancakes but the country fried steak is also something I always get.  It gets 4 stars because sometimes they are understaffed and takes a bit to get service.  But when I go, I'm usually not in a hurry anyways.  The staff is always friendly day or night. Even a simple side salad is fresh and deserving of props.  The awesome thing is the fresh desserts and pie will satisfy any drunk or Sunday camper.  If you're tired of the usual IHOP or hole in the wall breakfast place, enjoy the old school diner atmosphere that th is place has to offer.

I have lived in 11 states in my lifetime ranging from Boston, Virginia, Chicago, Central Illinois by St. Louis, New Orleans to Central Texas, and my family is from Nebraska, and have been to the contiguous 48 states.  I LOVE MY BBQ! I have also been cooking in restaurants for 25 years. I still think  that Tony Roma's may still have the best Baby Back ribs.  Yes, I said it even if it nullifies my review!.  Tony Roma's out of all the hidden gem Ma and Pa places that I have been too in Memphis, New Orleans, Fort Worth, KC, still provides fall-off-the-bone ribs with consistency every time!!!!  LOL.  My wife and I work hard, so most nights we are not wanting to cook and get delivery!  We are missing New Orleans since both of us have lived in that region, so why not get some Bar-BEE-cue to indulge in and have leftovers for the next day.  Okay, Bill Johnsons it is since that is what we can get delivered.   After spending nearly $60.00 to tantalize our addiction to a feasty pork feast (yeah, that made some of you squirmish), I was really disappointed!  OMG is an understatement!  How can you go wrong with any barbeque-smoked stuff?  What we ordered was a Smokehouse Sampler, Trailboss Dinner and a Cobb Salad. It was a feast for any two people with leftovers for work the next day. Their BBQ sauce is the St. Louis type you usually get, but tasted more like Arby's Sauce watered down. Is there Big Apple in it, I don't know.  It was very bland and nothing that was impressive at all.  I would put it at the bottom 3 bbq's that I've ever tasted.  The sides were delicious!  Mac n cheese, garlic mashed and Baked potato were fabulous, but the portions were very small in to-go cups. I've had better baked beans in a can, though, and wish they would add some of their smoky fixins in them to liven it up.  Come on, have two types if you're wanting to please everyone at least.  Bummed out!  The ribs were the worst I have ever had! They tasted fishy to me and I had to pull the meat off the bone so hard that I thought all of my crowns were going to come off! I know there are different types of ribs, but why did it taste like fish and so chewy?  The brisket had a lot of fat on them, which made my wife lose her appetite immediately. Don't you know to trim this after it smokes? I have to say the pulled pork was delicious, but the sauce ruined them.  The only thing my wife liked was the chicken. The cobb salad was okay, but the smoked ham was the thing that I could taste and was satisfied filling on the cobb salad and sides, not the barbeque stuff. I liked the smoked ham!   All in all, maybe we had the wrong things at this place, but I won't waste my money on this place ever again. Also, where is the cornbread? This place needs to go try other barbecue places and see what makes them unique.  That is what makes these places unique. I also couldn't purchase sides and wanted to try some of their other sides since that was the only good thing we had.  Try again on your recipe for the sauce.  Sorry guys, but very disappointed.

A funny story....My father, who has lived in over 20 states, was very skeptical about chicken and waffles together.  My parents came down here from Colorado to visit for a few months.  They wanted to try some of the great food Phoenix has to offer.  So, I said Lolo's, of course,was one of the places to go.  After the first time going, he said that Chicken and Waffles is one of the best combos that he has ever had and their waffles reminded him of the belgium waffles of New York City in the 60s.  My father in the following months wanted to go there a few time before he left and always left happy.  Their chicken is so crisp, yet very moist still on the inside. The waffles will never let you down either.  I am happy someone has fried okra in their town and my nieces love the macaroni and cheese and their various DRANKS of kool-aid.  My wife always has to have their sweetened tea, while I have to go with the grape drank!  Reminds me of the south and childhood!

Living in Louisiana, you always want to have something that reminds you of your childhood.  Well, Jamburritos also brought some innovation to the table too for the new age/ adult in me.  I went to the Great Cajun Cookoff and was amazed at what I tasted.  Red Beans and Rice and Jambalaya intertwined into burritos/tacos?  Also, the Catfish was cooked to perfection too.  I just wanted to tip my hat off to this express truck and excited to try something else on their menu!

They never get anything right and it smells like a pet store.  I would go into further detail but enough said.
