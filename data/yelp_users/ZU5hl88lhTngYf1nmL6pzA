I've been living on this side of town for over 4 years and have driven by the "Iowa beef" sign almost daily when I finally wised up and stopped in this amazing place. Why oh why did it take me so long!?   Al's is a small butcher shop but they carry everything you could ever dream of in regards to meat.  Chicken, beef, pork, they even have homemade sauce and meatballs!  It's a carnivores fantasy.   They grind their own beef right there and it's out of this world! 85/15 and just the most delicious flavor (you can request the fat ratio you'd prefer if this isn't to your liking). The beef is antibiotic free and hormone free too! Chicken is free range, they have lamb and veal upon request too! Not to mention deli selection,  and trays too! Whoa, overload here.   If you're looking for a great butcher and shop and want to know where your meat is coming from this is the place for you.  Believe me, you won't be disappointed.  Mmm Mmm mmmmmmmm.

Stopped in for breakfast with a friend and to catch up. I had a breakfast burrito with chorizo with a side of fruit. The portion was smaller than I expected but I was surprisingly happy about this as I think we are over served at most restaurants and end up with a ton of leftovers. My burrito was pretty good. The service was wonderful as my coffee cup was rarely empty, and this was a day I decided to drink A LOT of coffee.  My friend and I had a lot of catching up to do so we were there for an extended time. I never felt pressured to leave or uncomfortable about staying. It was a nice experience.  I would definitely return.

Over easy? More like over rated.  I had such high hopes for this place.  Meh.  After almost an hour drive across town to try this DDD breakfast joint we arrived excited.  Following a 15 min wait (not bad) we sat at our table and surveyed the menu.  I decided on the banana pecan pancakes and a side of corned beef hash.  The pancakes were wonderful. This is why I gave 2 stars.  I got the half order which consisted of 2 medium pancakes covered in a sweet caramel like sauce, 2 pieces of banana, and a sprinkle of pecans. I added some of the maple syrup that was on the table for an even sweeter treat.  My hash on the other hand was no different than a cheap diner, out of the can, mushy hash.  It was a disappointment. Major.  The service was friendly and reasonably attentive. My coffee stayed nearly full the entire visit which I appreciate.  I ordered the blueberry muffin with lemon curd to go. In my container were 3 small mini muffins with minimal berries, the opposite of moist, and a side of lemon curd that was actually wonderfully delicious.  The atmosphere was mediocre in a small square room filled with tables and chairs reminiscent of my childhood in the later 70s/early 80s. It put a smile on my face as I recognized the boomerang pattern and plastic chairs. I noticed how cramped this place was as I weaved my way to the restroom to wash my hands. Overall it was just ok for me.  I don't think I will be taking the drive back again.

This was my first visit to The Turf for a meal. I was in the mood for a good Reuben and excitedly order just that! Boy was I disappointed at what came out: a fat riddled, tough, disgusting sandwich I would be embarrassed to call a Reuben. :( luckily it came with a side of fries to hold me over. I had the waitress take it back and ended up eating part of my friends fried fish dinner, which was pretty tasty. I also had a quarter of our other table mates cheeseburger which was ok. Would I come back for dinner? Probably not. I wasn't impressed. At all. If I'm in the mood for Irish fare I will be sticking with Tim Finnegans from now on, or Johnny Foxs Public House.

I have been waxed all over the country, even the world!... And this gal (Andrea) is the best! She is super fast (which you want when someone's ripping your hair from its roots) and does it with an expertise that is appreciated. I originally came here after purchasing a Groupon but will definitely be returning again and again as a loyal client.

I wanted to leave a short review prior to my stepping foot in the place as I, too purchased a living social deal quite awhile back and was subjected to extremely rude behavior from the one they call Gary.  It was nearly impossible to get anyone on the phone and when I finally did I was met with nothing more than attitude and an "I'm too busy to be making this call" tone (there's a slight chance I was literally told that exactly).  I never did make an appointment as I didn't want to inconvenience anyone with my presence and therefore lost out on the value of said deal.  In reading all of these magnificent reviews it appears that I may have been the biggest winner of all.  My curiosity has been poked and now I'm almost tempted to see if it's as bad as you say! Or perhaps Gary has read the reviews as well and decided to make improvements. I would hope some criticism would open his eyes to make a few changes. I promise to write a new review if I get brave enough to enter.

I went to The Daily Dose Midtown for lunch. It wasn't very busy so I easily found myself a seat. After reviewing the extensive menu I decided on the Cobb Sandwich which was a delicious grilled chicken breast with blue cheese, lettuce, tomato and I'm probably leaving a few things off, on a pretzel bun. It came with a side (but I was accidentally offered two) of which I chose the sweet potato hash (cubed sweet potatoes, mushrooms and onions), and a side of fruit.  I thought everything was delicious. Would I go back? Absolutely. I caught a peek at someone's salad and it looked amazing. Huge, but amazing. I can't wait to try one next time.

My first time here was on a Saturday night and it was PACKED! We (4 of us) waited for an hour for a table which wasn't too bad as we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited. It did take quite a long time to get a bartenders attention just to order this drink but eh... To be expected. Once we were seated it didn't take long to get drinks and put in our order.  We had the pretzel bites with provolone fondue and they were decadent and marvelous. Mmm. I ordered the kale sweet potato salad w goat cheese. It had a sprinkle of pomegranate tendrils and a delicious dressing. I devoured it. My friends ordered the fried chicken, butternut squash tortellini, and a burger.  Everyone enjoyed their meals without complaint. My only negative would be that the table we were seated at was a bench on one side and chairs on the other, another table was close to ours which wasn't too bad until a man decided to join that table (sitting on the bench between us) and kept using our table as his arm rest! As we were eating dinner! How rude! But that's not The Yards fault. That's some rude hipster dude that had no respect for the people around him.

Everything about this place is outstanding! My friend and I arrived here on a Sunday morning for breakfast and good conversation.   The place was already packed!  We waited about 15 minutes for a table.    The atmosphere here is pretty good.  You have a choice of indoor or patio seating which I think is nice.  We sat inside as it was a scorcher.   I ordered the corned beef hash and it was dynamite! Real corned beef. Not that mushy canned junk. This was the real deal all crispy and tender and delicious!!! My friend had the avocado benedict and was extremely pleased.  Of course we HAD to try the house made jam as it is wonderful!!! I also appreciate the good sized coffee mugs they use and no shortage of refills.  I need a constant flow of coffee in the morning and Biscuits delivers.   My only complaint is the parking. There's just not enough for this amazing restaurant.   You may find yourself walking a little ways from car to restaurant...but you may need it after filling your belly with the tasty treats you'll find on this menu.  Mmm.

Happened upon this place while trying to decide what to grab to eat before a movie. It was fast but delicious. Not "fast food" or greasy. It's like a "subway" for fired pizzas, and it's fabulous! You can choose your base/sauce, meat or lack thereof, cheeses, and toppings as you watch them make it!  They also have salads FYI. I chose the steak gorgonzola pizza with a garlic base, roasted peppers, kalamata olives, fresh mozzarella, and grilled onions. It was amazingly delicious. The best part about this is that your pizza is the same price ($8) regardless of the amount of toppings you choose! So have at it!  My friend got a basic caprese type pizza. We both ate our entire pizzas before we headed to our movie. I will return to this establishment again and again! Great idea and location (as everything else nearby requires a "sit down" meal or is some type of Asian flavor).

I came across Mollys here on yelp while looking for a place to groom my 2 dogs (toy poodle and terrier mix).  I have been there twice in the last few months and am beyond pleased! Everyone there is so friendly and truly seem to care about my babies almost as much as I do. I'm a bit of an overprotective parent and don't trust my fur kids with just anyone.  I have no worries when leaving them with the staff at Molly's.    It's a joy to find a place where people are still willing to go out of their way to ensure great customer service while running a wonderful business. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an outstanding place to get your pets clean, smelling great, trimmed, and leaving happy!   Now go! Tell em Tina sent ya! :) lol
