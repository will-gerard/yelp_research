Cardboard! It's been awhile since I've been back to good ol Peter Piper but I can tell you that not much has changed.  Yes the kids love it and I can understand why.  But the pizza still years later still tastes like oven baked cardboard I'm sad to say.  I would give 1 star but its not like its supposed to be expensive gourmet.

We rented a tux for my boyfriend for a wedding that we were both in.  We were very happy with the experience and everything worked out great.  A few of the rentals we looked at were a bit older and threadbear but overall their selection was great.  We will return for future needs.

What a great experience.  I came to this office this week and was very impressed by both office and staff.  Dr. Foster is very nice, funny, and obviously good at what he does based on his before and after photo book. Treatment is for my daughter and I have honestly been putting it off for too long due to how expensive I know braces are.  The pricing options were good and they were very helpful to find a plan that fit our situation.  We both loved the office and are looking forward to more great visits.  Fun to see that others have posted their result pictures here, I will try to do the same!
