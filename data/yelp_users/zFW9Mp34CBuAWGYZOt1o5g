What a gem of a find, thanks my fellow yelpers.  I was staying down the street at the Tapatio Cliff resort.  I walked into the restaurant on property and wanted something different.  I yanked out my iphone and searched literally down the block this gem was.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed a delightful meal of eggplant parmagiana.  It was filling and the bartender was entertaining.  Next time I am in moon valley I will make a trip over to enjoy this place again.

Came in to get a drink and a snack while on a hour and a half layover.  I ordered a grey goose salty dog and a crab cake appetizer.  When my drink came it was a perfect drink; cold, tasty, well mixed and rather large.  Man, I thought I was at the right place.  When my crabcake came out it was a sandwich not the appetizer i had ordered.  I thought, oh well, have another drink and make do.  I ordered another drink and ate the crabcake.  The crabcake was nothing exceptional after all it was airport bar food.  I drank my second drink and asked for the bill.  When my waitress presented the bill it was $47 for 2 called drinks and a crabcake.  Wait a second...$47...even at airport prices this seemed over the top.  I looked at the bill again and those tasty and large Salty Dogs were actually billed as doubles $17 a piece.  I never asked for a double nor did she say anything about a double but, she sure stuck me on my bill for doubles.  As my flight was soon to be boarding I had no time to dispute the bill.  I paid the freight and reminded myself to not step foot in this establishment again.

Arizona may be hot in August but at least they have In-N-Out to make it bearable.  The thing I like most about them is no matter where you are they always are consistent.  My double double animal style is as good in Prescott as it is in Vegas, Dallas, or SoCal.  Keep up the great work and please come to San Antonio soon!

Nice hotel.  Got upgraded thanks to Hilton honors to a studio suite.  The room was nice but my complaint was the oversized room still only had 1 air conditioner.  In august Arizona is warm...okay hot... and the AC only had trouble cooling the room down.  Otherwise a very nice hotel with great rates.
