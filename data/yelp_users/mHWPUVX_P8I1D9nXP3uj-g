I can't say enough amazing things about this vet. Dr Grant is amazing. He has been seeing our dogs for a couple of years, today we had to make the tough decision to put one of our boys to sleep. Dr. Grant was so informative and willing to do whatever we chose and not milk us dry financially. I would highly recommend this office and Dr. Grant.

Just got off the phone with a lady at this business, she was very rude. Saw a groupon for 1.5 hour ride for 2, she said they are no longer on groupon and when did I see it? Did I say she was rude? Said she was speaking with the owner and they would honor the groupon for today but did not have any availability. Said "this is a busy time for us we don't have anything!" I was calling about reservations tomorrow but she didn't want to hear that. I would not recommend this business, they are rude.

We have been going here for years, but tonight was the last night for us. We had a call in order, after 20 minutes we showed up and the owner let us know they hadn't even made our pick up yet.  There was 1 other table. Once we got home we realized it wasn't even our order she gave us.  When we called to have it corrected the owner was rude and did not want to correct this matter. We drove back and got the correct order but the owner was rude when we got there.  What happened to customer service? It has been lost at this establishment.

Visited this location last night with my 10 year old. We had never been in a Jersey Mike's so we were up to try it. The subs were ok, nothing to write home about. The bigger issue was the soda machine and customer service. When my daughter went to fill her soda, she chose Sprite/Sierra Mist, the cup was filled with a clear liquid AND hundreds of ants! We took the cup to the cash register where we stood for over 7 minutes because the associates were in the back. Once the young man came out we showed him what was in the cup and he was also grossed out. He stated he would go clean the soda machine. Never once did we see anyone go clean the machine. We opted for a bottled drink instead. We ate our food and watched 4 other customers fill up their drinks from the ant infested soda machine. They all got dark sodas so I am sure they did not see the ants and continued drinking. This is a problem Jersey Mike's! Gross and I will never go back to one of your establishments.

it is always a pleasure taking my children here.  I have an 11 year old and 2 year old and its great for the both of them.  In the reading area an employee came through with a fun craft for them all to do and it was great! I love little touches like that. Keep up the good work.

Tried this place a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday.  The food was great but there are a few things that could be corrected. The menus (there is one on the wall and one at the register) they are not clear with everything that they serve. When I asked if they made orkra because it was not on the menu she informed me that they actually do sell it but not at that moment because it was all out, wasn't even on the menu.  The cook behind the see through wall almost created a fire in the kitchen by making a silly mistake.  The mac and cheese was a little dry.   The owner was there and was VERY nice and considerate.   We will definetly be back.

Went today for brunch. Thank goodness someone in our party made reservations because the man who "greeted" us was rather rude. The waitress didn't tend to us for a while, when she finally it was obvious she did not want to be there. She was not friendly or cordial in anyway.  The place is tiny and quaint, but dusty and dirty. The walls are lined with empty wine bottles that are dusty. The wine bottles are right next to your head if your sitting along the wall. It is so tiny that the wine storage also happened to be right next to our table. When I say wine storage I am talking the boxes of wine on top of each other stacked and very cluttered looking. Our food didn't come out together to I ended up waiting a while before the rest of my table received their meals. Now on to their food, it was very good. I wish I could have tried their lunch or dinner menu. We all enjoyed our meals. It was rather rich but good. We probably wouldn't go back as I enjoy local dinning for the interaction with the wait staff, owners for the establishment.  This place has great potential.

What a gem! Found it on yelp tonight and tried it. Started with the cheese app good, not as good as Arrogant Butcher but good. Dinner and staff was excellent. At one point my daughter and I comment on how nice the wait staff is at the same time. Very kid friendly!

Great local place to stop for ice cream and cookies. Their macaroons are so delicious.

This shop is adorable! Found it randomly today, it is very tucked away. The owner is sweet and helpful, I would highly recommend supporting this local shop!
