I stopped by about 3am, they had a sign out front that says Made Fresh to Order, everything Pretzel, no time frame, just available now, come on in. I have submitted thus false advertising to Morgan & Morgan for a Class Action Suit, and if you were in the parking lot about that time, I have taken pictures of people entering and leaving the store as well as License Plates of cars in the parking lot as I couldn't take a picture of a clock and signed time from employees, so if you are contacted by an attorney from the morning of 7/1 don't be surprised

Have used there services a few times for Non Profits, great customer service, the setup and tear down was very clean with no problems, would use there services again, and recommend them to anyone that needs services that they can provide for you.
