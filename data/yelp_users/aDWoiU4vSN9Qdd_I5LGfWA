Another one of my favorite spots, this place is awesome for pregame with $3 Blue Moons and $4.50 well drinks -- which was a shock to me the first time I went (See my MacFadden's Review). Becomes a club scene late at night, but the music isn't bad and the crowd is pretty cool. This place almost always frequents large group/clubs so its always fun to see them make dance circles.

One of the best places on Westgate (which isn't saying much). It tends to be underrated because everyone is so hellbent on going to MacFadden's to dance with the clubrats (who are 7s at best and hardly worth $6 and $7 drinks). Good blend of rock music and club music scattered throughout. The deer and beer specials are awesome and overall one of the cheapest places to go to ($5 Blue Moons -- ya, I know). Wet T-Shirt Night is kind of hit and miss on Wednesday's. A must go if you're (forced) to go to Westgate.

Actually, not bad. Unlike MacFadden's (the other dance spot) this place has a disignated dance floor, so you're not fighting your way through drunk people flailing their arms to get to the bar. Drink prices are better than Westgates, Carne Asada tacos for drunk munchies, and a beach-like environment... Good music too.

Not a fan of this place. Drinks are over priced, crappy music, and slow bartenders make it nearly unbearable. However, the $2 happy hours they pass out like candy make it a good pregame spot. Since it's one of the few dance places it attracts all the scantily clad clubrats. A lot of my friends like it but it's not my thing. It gives pub a bad name.

One of my favorite places on Mill. I'm a sucker for Euro-type bars and this place has an awesome pub feel. Thursday's they play techno music on the patio and awesome beer prices. Haven't tried the food though. This place is constantly crowded though, Thurs-Sat so get there early.
