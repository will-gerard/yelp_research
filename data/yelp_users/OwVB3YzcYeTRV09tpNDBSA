Quick, courteous and tasty, this Jack in the Crack delivers every time. Courtney at the drive through window is always pleasant and excited to provide the delicious goods, and with the best menu variety in the fast-food game, you can always find something to please the palate and the pocketbook. Never been disappointed going to this location and after yet another successful trip tonight, I doubt I ever will. Solid 4 stars, which ain't bad at all considering it is the restaurant known in the 90s for killing all those kids with E. Coli.

I am still ecstatic after my first trip to Bridwell Automotive Center. The staff was courteous and knowledgeable and they not only identified my car's problems quickly, but they fixed them for a fraction of what I was charged elsewhere.   Jack, the mechanic was extremely helpful and forthcoming, he told me everything I needed to know about the issues I was having. My Kia is purring like a Korean kitten now and after a terrible week of car repair headaches at other businesses, it's the greatest sound in the world to me.   I did not get a chance to use their full service gas station, but can definitely see the benefit once those 110 degree days start coming. I highly recommend this business and will most definitely be returning in the future for any of my service needs. Could not be happier.

Words cannot begin to describe the glory that is this fine establishment. Never had bad service or a bad meal. These puff pastry stuffed bundles of heaven erupt with surgically precise flavor combinations that leave me speechless every single time.   My new favorite is the Lamb & Mint, a delicious combination of succulent and juicy lamb, perfectly sliced potatoes, rutabaga, and of course, the fresh mint sprigs make for a truly transcendental dining experience.   After tasting more than 3/4 of their menu, I have yet to taste a single thing that wasn't perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced, or perfectly paired with their exquisite red wine gravy. I could drink that delicious concoction by the gallon.   The vegetarian pasties are undeniably good as well, the Eggplant Parmesan is a worldly experience that I could eat any time, any day. It stuffs the best bits of the garden into a mozzarella, marinara and Parmesan wrapped envelope of goodness that has to be tasted to be appreciated.  The Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton Cheese soup is out of this world, the Garlic & Herb Roasted Red Mashed Potatoes with Cheese make all other mashed potato dishes taste like dehydrated flake garbage, and the desserts (if you can find any more room in your belly for awesome) are the food of gods. The PB&J Pasty or the Banoffee Pie make me want to live in this restaurant until the day I die.  The location is being renovated currently to expand into the adjacent building, which is a welcomed change as the intimate dining area admittedly cramped on busy days. Though it is a wondrous experience to watch the staff prepare their pasties mere feet from your seat, it will really do well to have a few more tables. Sit at the bar if at all possible for the best dining experience.  I wish I could give CPC 6 stars simply because the other places I've deemed worthy of 5 stars simply cannot compare. On top of all this, the unparalleled drinking specials, 32 oz steins, and $3 car bombs every day make this not only a wonderful place to eat, but a perfect spot to pickle the liver as well.

Nothing beats a #1 with grilled onions, no tomatoes, well done french fries and a pink lemonade. I've been known to eat here twice to three times a week and find absolutely nothing wrong with that. There's magic in those delicious burgers, just one bite and you are instantly transported to a world of savory goodness unmatched anywhere else on this little blue marble we call Earth.

Went in with a intermittent squeak coming from the belt. Chris, the 'floating manager' told me it was an idler pulley and that he needed to order the part. Once the part was installed, the car makes even worse squealing constantly now and Chris tried to sell me on another $300 part. saying it was the tensioner assembly that was going out. They were closing and could not get the part that day and told me to come back the next day to get more work. This place truly exemplifies the shiesty mechanic stereotype, no quality control or professionalism.    If it is an oil change or a blown out tire, I wouldn't doubt these grease jockeys can help, but don't trust them for any service past that or you'll end up worse off than you started.

The issues with my vehicle have still not been addressed. David, the manager, has told me I needed new parts, ordered them, and then called me back to say they were not the correct parts and now the correct part will cost over $500 plus labor. (labor that he previously said would be covered due to the inconvenience) The excessive waste of time, inability to address the issue, continued disappointment and steeply rising costs have brought me to the point where I will be contacting the BBB to report this Midas station, and contacting my bank to process a chargeback. For three days my car has been tinkered with and still it sounds worse than when I brought it in.

After 4 days of getting the run-around from multiple 'managers' I was told the part that was ordered did not come in, and that it would be another 3 days wait. My car is no longer drivable due largely to the repeated mishandling of the idler pulley replacement.   I have requested a refund in full and will be taking my vehicle to another service. Save your money, time and sanity, stay away from this Midas.

How is it I never have written a review for this bar? I've been frequenting this place for, what, almost 8 years now since it changed over from Old Chicago? Has it really been that long?   Well, now I feel old. Anyways, Boulders has one of the best curated beer selections in the state, and it is staffed by some of the best bartenders in the country. The pizza recipes are solid, the California Carver is the go-to pie, but the signature hotdog selection will always hold a special place in my heart. "Hungover Man's Best Friend" lives up to the name. Sweet potato tots...sooo good...  Try the bloody mary or mi-monkey if it's still early, or choose a tap at random. You can't go wrong.

Extremely confused by these negative reviews, some as recent as last week even?! I've been coming to this remarkable establishment for a little over two months and have yet to have anything but impeccable service and outstanding meals.  The staff was courteous, engaging and quick. Our dishes came out fresh and were truly fantastically presented. The Lisa Lisa Crunch and OMG rollls were amazing, the fried crab wontons are a must have, and our waiter recommended a hamachi sashimi dish that was so delectable, I wanted to lick the plate. I have yet to try the Chinese dishes off the menu, but the couple to our left had a chicken dish that smelled unholy good.  The first time I went, I was not expecting much, the location (strip mall) and the outside of the building do not do the inside justice. It was clean, well decorated and surprisingly adorned with multiple flat screen TVs with a veritable cornucopia of sport programming playing on them.  Sat at the bar every time we went, and the bartender/server was a real treat suggested great dishes and ultimately added to the overall experience. On a whim, we pulled up the yelp page as we were finishing up and we saw the terrible reviews and had to put in our two cents.  Give this place a try during happy hour, pull up a seat at the bar, relax and enjoy a delicious meal.

Mom & Pop establishment with some darn tasty gyros and some of the best fries I've had at any restaurant. They have an eclectic menu with some standard American fare, but the gyros are top notch. It's nearly unnoticeable from the street and I'm kicking myself for not finding it sooner as I live just up Hayden.   Mediterranean food at its finest, like a schwarma slingin' food truck parked in a strip mall and never found it necessary to move. Easy on the stomach and the wallet, the #16 gyro combo is the way to go. Heard nothing but raves about the salad from the table of red hat ladies next to us, and I fell in love with the tahini after first bite.   The obligatory Sriracha sauce adorned the table and mixed in with the ketchup for the fries made for a pleasant and fiery surprise. I highly suggest giving this place a try the next time you're in the area instead of wasting your money and time at the nearby BK Lounge. Family owned, by friendly people dedicated to bringing the best Mediterranean fare I've had in the Valley, give your tastebuds a treat today.

Small delivery order was 50+ minutes late. Chicken sandwich was miserably cold, soaked in mayo, and the coleslaw was warm and the fries were steamed to mush.

So good it makes you want to raise a dog of your own just to have the off chance of having it named after a new featured dog of the week recipe. I had one of their dogs for lunch the drove across to valley to have another for dinner. Calling these culinary concoctions gourmet doesn't begin to describe the goodness found in every single bite.

The newest guac on the block, this Chipotle makes one mean burrito. Brand spanking new and shiny, the restaurant is built on the site of a completely renovated 'Barbeques Galore' store right next door to the Lamps Plus in the heart of the Pavillions Shopping Center.   This is the first location I spotted the franchise's newly introduced cilantro lime brown rice and I've got to say the nuttiness and texture really add to the burrito experience. With everything you've come to love from a Chipotle on top of the added freshness of a newly built kitchen, I couldn't ask for more in a meal.  The staff is quite young, but they spoon out the delicious burrito fillings with the deft hands of burrito making veterans, smiling throughout the interaction and engaging the customer with interest. The cook tended a slew of delicious marinated chicken on the grill, and sat humming cheerfully as they browned. The sounds of the juices crackling on the hot grill echoing through the restaurant seemed to compliment his tune.  Once I had paid, I took an empty seat and began to unwrap the glory that is the Chipotle steak burrito. With childlike abandon, I began tearing into this marvel of modern culinary magic, devouring bite after bite until I was left empty-handed and full-bellied. A highly recommended ending to a long day at the office.  Could not be more satisfied with my meal here, and look forward to coming back time and time again, as the location is perfectly situated on my commute home from work. Clean, friendly, delicious, nutritious and nearby, truly a 5 star establishment.

The restaurant was very clean, very modern, and well-staffed with bright smiling faces. The expansive bank of shining menu screens lit the entire ordering area in a sterile blue glow, and the eating area is deceptively large, bigger than the building appears from outside even.   The cafeteria-style counter gives an excellent view of the fresh salads, the soups are all well-marked and taster samples are freely offered to indecisive patrons. Initially I went for a bowl of Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup and an Asian BBQ Pork sandwich, and quickly devoured them both.   Unfortunately the meal quickly turned south on me, and my lunch was not enjoyed for long. I wasn't sure if I could cast blame for the sudden illness on Cafe Zupas (neither of my lunch mates got sick), so some weeks later I returned to the establishment with the same friends to further explore the menu...  A bowl of lobster bisque soup and a turkey bacon avocado sandwich this time, but ultimately experienced the same results. Quick-onset stomach cramps and the other lovely symptoms of which I will spare you detail.   As much as I enjoyed the atmosphere, menu variety, service and location, I enjoy not being sick much more. After careful thought and consideration, I think the food may not be entirely to blame. I believe it may be an reaction to the cleaning products they use for their soup bowls. I'm not going back to test the hypothesis though...

Truly excellent breakfast. Unique and traditional dishes all cooked to perfection. The Tortilla Española is divine and the BMOC is as hearty as you can get. Superb coffee bar as well. Inexpensive for the portions. Will be frequenting this establishment for breakfast going forward. So glad we gave it a try today. I had to go straight home and lay down afterwards, so filling, so satisfied. Totally earned the 5 star rating.

An enchilada eatery that thrives doign things the right way. With fresh ingredients, fast preparation, and delicious results. By giving the people the choicest choices of ingredients and letting them decide how to dress it up, it gets a lot of comparisons to Chipotle, and while Chipotle deserves all due respect, Gadzooks has truly raised the bar for Phoenix-based Mexican food. The green chile pork and tomatillo chicken are delicious, the braised short rib is savory, the jack potatoes are unreal. Add the hand mixed guacamole for extra creaminess, the slaw for some crunch, or get the fried egg on top for an authenic (and filling) flavor experience. Go early to avoid the longer lines, just don't get it to-go, it's best when eaten fresh out of the oven. My only regret after each trip is not having enough room in the stomach to eat three more orders.

If you're downtown and hungry there may be plenty of places you can go, but none will be as satisfying, as fresh, or as dedicated to the art of delicious as Short Leash.   Fried pickles are a must. Their salads are fresh and the entrées are inventive creations that leave you with a full stomach and a stupid grin.  Short Leash's Signature dogs feature meats from Phoenix's historic butcher Schreiner's Fine Sausages. The meat is grilled along with innovative and daring ingredients and then cradled in a warm naan flatbread.   By marrying fresh local ingredients with savory hot dog flavor, Short Leash has created a refreshing, fulfilling and truly transcendental hot dog eating experience. I would eat here daily if I could and I recommend it to all who enjoy life.

Our waitress was great and suggested multiple dishes and options that I'll be trying real soon.   For starters, the shattered potatoes are better than any fries I've ever had. Dipped in that jalapeño sauce, so good.  Also you can add a fried egg to any burger, and they offer fresh English muffins as an alternative bun, she suggested going this route with the standard cheeseburger.  The Crispy Chicken Sandwich came very highly recommended, a staff favorite. It had a golden brown crust and it looked friggin amazing.   Lots of people were ordering the kale salad, and it looked, well, it looked like a kale salad to be honest. Probably pretty bomb considering the frequency it was being ordered though.  The tuna sandwich was going out as much as the salads were, which I found a bit odd, but she said their Egg Salad Sandwich is one of the best sandwiches in the valley, and it's only sold for one hour a day...hot damn.  I had the Paris, Texas Burger. It was...wow...  The beef was unbelievably savory, cooked medium rare with incredible mouthfeel, juicy but not at all greasy. Pancetta was salty and perfectly crispy, bacon's better brother. Sharp cheddar cheese blanketed the beef, holding it all together and melding the flavors into umami heaven. The apple butter BBQ sauce is otherworldly, sweet but with this slight smoky flavor that just rounds it all out. The dill pickles chips gave a fresh & light crispness to each bite, and the fresh poppyseed buns were baked to perfection culminating in this amazing amalgamation of tastes and textures. A new flavor took center stage with each chew, and I must have made the family that sat next to us really uncomfortable with all the moaning and grunting I was making as I ate.   The waitress also gave us a little dish of their lacto-fermented jalapeño hot sauce and it took the flavors to another level.  Spicy-sweet-salty-savory-juicy-crisp-chewy-melty-glory.

Tremendous. Stunningly great street eats. These burgers are perfectly cooked, the toppings perfectly accent the meat, and the juices and flavors combine into an amalgamation of goodness in every bite.  The California Burger is king. The egg and avocado make the dish. Use the fries to sop up the extra. So frigging good I could eat it twice a day. I'd have a heart attack in a week but...yeah.   The Italian one is amazing too. Honorable mention must be made. All said, these guys are delivering better-than gourmet burgers that make for a meal well worth chasing across the valley.

Conveyor belt sushi!!! Say hello to the future of foodery!   I wasn't aware this was a chain restaurant but am very glad the concept is working for them. Japanese-style conveyors shuttle an extensive variety of delicious dishes around the room and you take a plate at your leisure...what's not to like?    The quality is surprisingly excellent considering the landlocked metropolitan area, and the offerings change by the minute for the more indecisive among us. Classic rolls, specialty nigiri, superb dumplings, side salads & multicultural desserts, just choose whatever plate strikes your fancy and devour!!  Take out is available but the novelty and the fun is lost completely. All-in-all this place simultaneously delivers a great meal and experience, I will gladly return for another round soon.   Only cons to consider are the sub-par service and the quality of chopsticks, but otherwise a worthy and worthwhile culinary endeavor.

Excellent prices for the social hour menu, unbeatable service and top notch food. For starters we had the fried green tomatoes, which were the best I've ever had in Phoenix. The dirty rice balls were even better though, pairing exceptionally well with sweet corn relish and smoked onion cream sauce. I nearly licked the plate clean!   The cocktails here are otherworldly and the bartenders really know their craft. We talked intently about whiskeys and down-home fried southern cooking and I can't remember the last time I was so impressed with a drink as I was with the hush puppy hush. I could get away with ordering pink fruity martinis more often I wouldn't drink anything else!   We will be back soon for fall restaurant week to try their fried okra, duck confit, and black forest chocolate cake. I must say, I'm excited to return.
