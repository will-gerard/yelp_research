I LOVE this place. It's been a family favorite for years and years. Amazing thin and deep dish pizza! Ginormous, tasty salads! The kick butt cheesy garlic bread is to die for. This spot is a can't miss!

There's just something special about this place. It's been a fixture on 7th St for many years. It's not at all updated inside, but that is no bother at all. It's like stepping into a different time.  All the food is made to order, so it's hot and fresh. The Bulldog hotdog is the bomb! All sandwiches and hotdogs come with a side, so you get a ton of food without breaking the bank.

I'm mildly obsessed... I love chips and salsa! The cheese crisp is yummy, and so are the mini chimis. And man oh man!- their street tacos!   My only complaint would be is that they're a bit misleading. They don't bother to tell you that the sour cream and guacamole they offer when you're ordering with your meal, doesn't center with it. We learned that the hard way when $12 of our check was just sauces! Oops! Live and learn.   Besides that, I think they're great!

I don't get it. I see all the buses and billboards, so they MUST do something right. I've given this locations a hand full of times, and no one has ever acknowledged my existence. It seems like a lot of super dated pieces... thrift store finds at boutique prices. I've not ever enjoyed my experience there, and don't know that I'll subject myself to this location again.

Oh man! How I love me some Pat's! Inexpensive, and crazy tasty. Stop in for a slice of pizza the size of your head for a super reasonable price!

Love this breakfast dive-- From the sassy decor, to the generous helpings!   Very reasonably priced, especially considering the amount of food you get. Big bang for your buck. AND on Sundays you get a free scoop of ice cream with your meal.   The service can be iffy at times. I've had more good experiences than bad ones though.

I tried Ray's Pizza for the first time yesterday. The dining room was very spacious and clean. The pizza was tasty--- a little bit old, but I was there at 2:30 or so, so not a typical lunch or dinner time frame. All of the staff was friendly and professional except for the woman that rung us up. She was very unhappy looking and was wearing sweats. That was a little weird.   I'll definitely give them another try though.

I've never had bad food from Four Peaks. The very best thing though... the spinach dip. If it were legal, I would marry it. It's crazy delicious.   The only bummer is, I've never been impressed by the staff. They're awfully haughty for people slinging beer and burgers.

THE worst. I cannot believe how difficult it is to do business with this credit union. I have my auto loan through them, and they can do literally NOTHING over the phone. They always suggest you come into the branch regardless of the fact that their only open the same hours I'm always at work. Even if you make time to go in and deal with things face to face, they somehow manage to "lose" your paperwork. AND with your paperwork mysteriously gone forever, you get to pay all sorts of overdraft and late fees when they completely screw up your payment ACH date... after taking time to do in person.   NEVER AGAIN...

I came in just to do some fact finding on getting my nose pierced, and man oh man did I get some facts! My brother and I hung out there over half an hour while they gave us a tour of the shop, and a run down of how they do things. I didn't end up getting a piercing, but I was mesmerized by all the super affordable jewelry, and ended up buying a $32 ring that actually fits my enormous fingers. I am so appreciative of the time they spent with me!

Can't beat those prices! With some of the power tools, you get what you pay for, but you can buy a crazy cheap warranty, and take it back if it breaks.

The service is pretty hit or miss, but I still love this place! Anything from a plain old dinner salad, to a sandwich, to a home-made feel entre--- amazing! The prices are fair, and the food is great!   It's hard for me to leave with out a dinner salad that comes out on a chilled plate, with grated carrots and cheese on top. Their ranch is the best! The pizza is bananas! So good! I love ordering too much, and then eating it again for lunch the next day. And you HAVE to try the cinnamon dessert. I could most likely just live on that alone for the rest of my life and die a very happy girl.

If possible, ask to sit in Jenn's section. She is basically awesome. Courteous, patient, prompt, and personable. We've sat in her section before, and she never disappoints.  As for the food... SO good. I honestly would go just to eat chips, vats full of salsa, and cheese crisps. But the fajitas are good, and so are the burritos.

I LOVE this place. That green chili is the bomb! They serve Pepsi products which of course is best with Mexican food.   I'd do 5 stars if they would step into the year 2016 and accept card payments. I never carry cash, so I always have to stop at Wells Fargo in the parking lot first.

I love Florencia's. I used to go pretty often, but was reintroduced when I started a job down the street. I have a whole new appreciation for it now that I know about their great lunch specials. Their lunch slices are actually two slices from a medium pizza, so getting just one slice is REALLY filling!

The food here is fair. The staff seems pretty snarky. Our waitress accidentally spilled food on us, which is okay... I mean, accidents happen. The thing that I found to be upsetting is the manager didn't even offer to discount my meal or anything, which I had plenty of time to stew over as I sat in ranch dressing stained pants for the rest of the day at work. The waitress offered to pay for my lunch, but I didn't feel that that was necessary... I feel like management should take care of these things, not the waitress. I did appreciate her offer though, which is why they get two stars over one.

I feel like it's one of the few trendy places that really lives up to the hype.   You walk in and feel instantly cooler. SUCH a casual vibe, but in a good way. The art on the walls is always interesting. I think it's a little yucky that some of the furniture is so beat up looking in such a pretty place though.   I've had dessert and coffee here. Both very tasty. The service is pretty good as well.  My one thing is that it always seems to be so busy. And by all means, that's great for them. But I'm always seem to be in someone's way when I'm by the counter waiting for my coffee. And so many people have settled in to be there a long time with their laptops and stuff, and that just makes the space seem a bit cramped.   All in all though, Lux is worth checking out.

Is the service here good? Nope. It's really not. But it does seem to be getting a little better. And really, with the exceptions of spitting in my face or insulting my mama, nothing they could do could get me to stop going. And believe me, I have horrible service stories... One including Sylvia herself.   The thing is, the food is wonderful! I would go for the flour tortilla chips and the chunky salsa alone. Those two together = masterpiece. We typically go and split an entree, and leave having spent only $10 or less. Boom! Deliciousness on a dime, people!

I quit. Gone are the days of bringing in all of my friends and family to eat at yummy Sylvia's. My boyfriend and I used to go AT LEAST three times a month, but the service just kept getting worse and worse. We stopped going, but really missed the street tacos and flour chips and salsa, so we decided to try again.   There was about 10 minutes left of happy hour. By the time our waitress came it there was only about 5 minutes left. I asked if I could get a margarita on happy hour and she said it was too late. We ordered flour chips... which we never received. Then, our waitress disappeared for a pretty ridiculous long amount of time. She apologized when she came back explaining that she was held up in the bar section. That's fine. Stuff happens. Then we finally get to put in our dinner order. We were going to split something, but I really wanted to try a navajo taco. Then she disappeared forever again. When we got our food my navajo taco was SUPER burnt, and completely not the kind that I had ordered. We had been there so long at that point that we decided to just go ahead and share. The burrito was good, but not worth the wait.   Never. Going. Back.

This is probably my favorite pizza in town! The cheese is amazing, and the pepperoni they use is fantastic!   The only reason I'd not rate then five stars is because the service is lackluster. I've never had particularly good service. It always seems to take long time to get our order in, or refills on drinks. It'd be something I could look past a little more, but it's a tad on the pricey side... The pizza is worth the price, but not the service.

First off, True Foods is a beautiful restaurant! I love the decor, and I even love how the staff is dressed. It's just an overall nice place to be.   Some friends and I tried it for the first time recently. LOVED the hummus appetizer and shaved turkey sandwich. Out of curiosity, we tried the kale-ade... mistake. A $6 mistake. I really even tried to like it. It's just a big jumble of unpleasant flavors. For dessert we shared the lemon tart, and the rhubarb crisp. Both were tremendous!   With all this tasty food to try, it's hard not to get carried away. But keep in mind if you get an appetizer, drink, meal, and dessert... expect to have a pretty hefty bill.   Other than that, my only real complaint is that the light fixtures are really yucky dusty. I know we live in the desert, and it's in a hard to reach place, but it's gross to look up and see all that dust looming above your food...

I've only been here once, but holy moley was it ever delicious! I can't wait to come back!   We had no idea what wine to order, but our server was awesome, and so knowledgeable! He helped us pick the perfect bottle. Our bruschetta board was amazing!   Not only is the food and drink great, but the ambiance and service are top notch as well.

So! Fun fact! If you do the survey on the bottom of the receipt, they'll honor it as a coupon for a free medium coffee. Hot or cold. Boom! They don't usually give you a receipt for it, but if you want another receipt, you can order two munchkins for $.55 including tax! Try a mix of caramel and mocha swirl! Sooooo yummy!  Edit 7/28/13 You can't do the survey for a free drink anymore. I emailed them saying that I understood why they had to stop, but was sad to see it go, and they sent me a $5 gift card for my feedback. Who does that?! Awesome people, that's who! I'll always go back there!

There's just something about their bread! It's amazing!!  This restaurant is super casual, with ultra-hip looking, laid back staff. It is LOUD in there. So know that going in. But also know that you're about to enjoy some delicious food and drink.   If you get pretzels, (which you probably should) you should most definitely order the beer cheese to dip it in. It's amazing. If you order pizza, (which you probably should) you should stick to one of their specialty pizzas. The first few times we went, we ordered a pepperoni pizza, and it's not like it was bad or anything, but the specialties really kick it up a notch. My favorite is the buffalo chicken.   The service can be slow, but not too bad. This place is definitely worth a try.

They are consistently busy, but apparently are not able to perfect their craft. Very, very slow. Whether it be four cars in line, or twelve, I always seem to be waiting at least 15 minutes or more for my coffee. One time it took SO long, they gave me my coffee for free... which is nice... but when I got to my destination I saw that both drinks I received were wrong.

Stopped in looking to buy, and was approached by Keith. Keith was a nice man; Someone I wouldn't mind doing business with. Apparently he was new though, because he was completely at the mercy of the sales managers.   We wanted to trade in my car, so Keith collected all of the car's information, so they could appraise it. He took it in to appraise it while we test drove a used Mini. We loved it, and could have been talked into it, but when we got back, the sales manager said he was far too busy to appraise the vehicle, and gave no real estimate of time when he would get around to it. I thought all of this was peculiar, as there really were no other customers to speak of.   We left, and Keith called two days later to offer me $1000 for my BMW. No thanks, Keith. No thanks.   I will say, I definitely didn't feel pressured to buy... I did however felt a little pressured to leave and not come back.  As soon as that manager heard I only wanted to spend $12k-$15k, I was an instant write off. It's pretty insulting.

Zinnias is just a funky treasure trove. You never know what you're going to happen across. From the gorgeous mantelpiece which is now hanging in my living room, to the kitten iron on tea towel transfers my boyfriend bought me for Christmas this year. I have been shopping there since they opened, and will continue to do so!

Holy smokes! I may have been disappointed in the service I received during my visit, but geez did Upward Projects ever step up to the plate! Someone saw my prior review and emailed me asking for my contact information. The next day the nicest lady ever, Brittany called me and thanked me for my sincere feedback,and apologized that I felt rushed/ignored. She was so kind and genuine. On top of that, I got an invitation in the mail to come back in for an improved experience.   Talk about amazing service!

Use at your own risk!!  We paid for a $5.99 wash. We got trapped inside, and the belt pulled us into the truck ahead of us... and then pulled the car behind us into us.   The car wash blamed the man at the start of the line, claiming he hit his brakes causing the accident.   The man at the front of the line blames the car wash, and refused to leave any insurance information.   We called the police and filed a police report, but with no one admitting fault, looks like our $5.99 car wash turned into a broken grill, and dented hood and trunk. The police officer said that he'd been to the car-wash himself a hand full of times on similar calls.   Careful!

The cameras posted were literally no help in this case. Upon review, the footage was not clear enough to make out who was at fault.   Good thing we have full coverage insurance. I would recommend you do too if you use this car wash, or others like it.

I am in LOVE with this store! It's the best place in town to pull off your thrifty fashionista style.  Every time I bring a friend or relative with me, we load up our fitting rooms with fun, unique finds, and always leave with a treasure of some sort.  I love the boutique feel, where I am not having to sift through tons of racks of shoddy, outdated clothes. This location is smaller, and its obvious Nicole has a discerning eye when it comes to picking the best items.  Bottom line: this is by far my favorite resale clothing store in Phoenix!

Not a fan of this place. I hear its fun on weeknights. But don't bother coming on the weekend. Especially for a birthday. They'll have you wait two or more hours for a table even though the promise you an hour to hour and a half. They'll say you're next on the list but continually seat people before you. Lame. Gotta love being lied to and having your friend's birthday party being basically ruined.

I love this DSW. I have been SO successful in finding good deals at this location! Like the $8 adorable flats I got today! I love that clearance section!   I appreciate that there is an amazing variety for size 10 shoes. There's even a decent variety of size 11 shoes , which is typically pretty impossible to find.  I also appreciate that the associates are so friendly and helpful! An associate even carried several of our finds up to the front for us when we're struggling to carry them while we shopped. How sweet is that?!

I had trouble getting the app to work this morning. Candace, a manager no less could not have made me feel more stupid and terrible. She was anything but patient. How dare I have audacity to ask her a question about the app? Don't I know she has NOTHING to do with it? I dint expect that she did have anything to do with it. I was just hoping not to be put in my place trying to buy some coffee.

Well I'll eat my words! The manager that was short with me called me personally to apologize. I think that takes a lot of guts! She really wanted to make it right, and offered me free coffees and donuts, but that's not at all necessary. I have a lot of respect for someone so kind to acknowledge my hurt feelings so sweetly. She made my day and I appreciate it!

I am so happy that Mary Coyle has returned to the valley!  Their ice cream is still super tasty, but I'm sad that their new location has basically no ambiance whatsoever. All the personality of a hospital cafeteria.   But what's really important is that a Phoenix staple is back in business- and just as tasty as ever! I can only assume that updates to the restaurant will come with time.

This store is just fantastic! The ambiance, the staff... It's just like visiting your really stylish friend's house, but in this scenario, you actually get to take your favorite pieces home with you! Most of the furniture is made by the shop owner, and he is more than happy to make any piece smaller, larger, and/or a different color. I have an one of their awesome console tables in my hallway.   I can't wait to go back!

I've visited three times in the last week. I've discovered that the less busy the location is, the slower the service.i just waited ten minutes for one drink, and I was the only car in the drive thru, and there were only a couple of people in the parking lot. I wanted to leave, but had already paid. They definitely got that done quickly...
