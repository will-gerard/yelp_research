Always so good. Authentic food. Owner is here daily and often will come to check on you. Some may not like the location but trust me the food more then makes up for it.

Things use to be great here, they switched doctors and now not so good. There are people there that care unfortunately not the case for the entire practice. They often make you wait long periods of time and fail to follow through as they commit. The urgent care however is still ran by the same doctor and is a saving grace as well as some of the front desk staff.

Seen this little truck rolling round town decided to try it... pretty good. Worth the stop, fair prices.

This has quickly become my favorite lunch go to spot. Not only that but my 6 yr old likes the food too. Even tried the baklava. Always great service and serving sizes are perfect.
