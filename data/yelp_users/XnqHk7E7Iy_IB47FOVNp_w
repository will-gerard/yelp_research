We came here with low expectations, after all we were here for the 4p-6:30p, $8.99 prime rib dinner special.  Located inside the Fremont Casino on Fremont Street of Las Vegas you can't not see the huge pictures boasting the $8.99 Prime Rib Special.  After 9pm you can get a $12.99 Steak and Lobster special, but that was way too late for our hungry tummies.  There was a small line at Tony Roma's and the hostess passed out paper ticket numbers instead of the traditional write your name on list.  Much to our surprise the hostess rattled off numbers faster than a machine gun, often calling 6 parties at once.  For a split second I thought what is this, are we all going to sit at a cafeteria style bench?  I guess TR's gets about 1000 customers a night so they are really set up be fast and efficient.  We were seated quickly in a nice booth.  Again much to our surprise our waitress was fast and friendly as well.  Furthermore the helpers clearing tables, getting drink refills and bringing out food were all fast and friendly something I really didn't expect on a blue light special meal.  Of course we ordered the prime rib which came with steamed veggies and a small baked potato.  The portions were good sized and tasty.  The night before we ate at Lawry's House of Prime Rib and although TR's prime rib is not comparable it was still moist, tender and flavorful.   Although I wouldn't recommend Tony Roma's for any special occasions if you want a great deal on Prime Rib this is the spot to go.

Well this was the first time we have come to Vegas and not stayed on the strip and it wasn't bad at all.  I decided to go Golden Nugget because we were coming to watch the Pacquaio vs Mayweather fight and those tickets were already $3k each, ie time to save some money on the hotel LOL.  Golden Nugget actually backs Freemont Street so you can just walk out of the casino and bam, you are right in the middle of all the festivities.  Room rates are pretty cheap here, but if you want to stay in the nice updated rooms its going to bump up cost to about what staying at the Luxor would be.  That being said the normal rooms are certainly not fancy, but they get the job done.    The pool area is probably the highlight of GN with a huge aquarium in the center which includes a see through slide tube that shoots right through the center of the aquarium giving you a horrifying glimpse of sharks and other large fish as you splash on by.  There is also a bar in the pool and table games surrounding the pool area complete with bikini clad dealers.  There are lots of places to eat and drink inside the GN as well as a few shops.  The casino area was nice and we especially enjoyed the "no commission" Fortune Pai Gow tables.  In general all of the downtown casinos are favorable versus casinos on the strip.  There is no resort fee downtown, but there is a small $4 or so downtown renovation fee.  Wifi is not included but it is available for a fee.  Now, if you are planning on traveling to the strip often, you need a rental car.  Taxi rides are around $25 not including tip so if you don't want to rent a car you should probably stay on the strip itself.   If you don't mind the cab fare and want to try something different give GN a try.  GN is definitely the nicest hotel/casino in the downtown area and Freemont Street is fun free entertainment.

Stayed here a few times, beautiful classy casino/hotel.  One of my favorite places here is Zoozacrackers Deli killer Zooza Burger and Zooza Bene!  The suites are large and well appointed but unless you catch a good deal this place is pricey to stay at.  The casino and nightclubs here are also nice with good service.  In addition the strip of high end shops makes for interesting shopping.  In particular the high end watcth store staff was sooo friendly not snooty like other places.  The let me try on a $250,000 watch and gave me some free magazines as well-gotta love that!  Fashion Mall and Strip Steak are located right across the street as well.  The buffet here gets rave reviews, but I only classify it as good.

This is one of our favorite spots on the strip to have lunch and see a magnificent view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Perched upon the 12th floor or so the swank restaurant and full bar offer pent house style atmosphere.  Prices are upscale with most lunch entrees ranging from $16 to $36.  We sampled the following items:  Lamb Burger: a thick 1/2 pound crazy juicy mouthful of wonderfulness! Using Moroccan spices red peppers, onions and yellow squash this burger was one to remember.  Potato chips were served on the side $18.  Eiffel Tower Burger a classic well cooked yummy burger also served with potato chips.  The burger was good but not in the same class as the lamb burger $16  Mushroom Pasta: fresh spaghetti noodles with a light sauce and mushrooms. Great flavor and just the right size portion $18  French Cream of Onion Soup; creamy onion soup, I prefer the original version $6  Lunch was also served with a Celery root puree which was a delicious bite and the some of the best baguettes ever!  Since we were there to celebrate my daughters birthday she was presented with a beautiful chocolate mousse along with milk chocolates and jelly candies.  Service was outstanding and although the prices were high it was well a great dining experience.  I highly recommend coming for lunch.  Note: The Bellagio Fountains start at 12 or 1pm on the weekends.

Was not impressed by anything here. We sat at the bar because of the long wait for a table, fries were decent but the burger tasted like charcoal and was expensive to boot. There are far better places to get a burger in Vegas!

Wow, this was actually the second best Cirque show I have ever seen and I think I have seen all of them!  This show had good humor, interesting dancing and unusual sets.  The nudity was minimal and the show didnt drag on like most shows.

Luxor is rated as a 4 star resort, however it charges below average rates which attracts below average guests.  If you are on a tight budget and you want a 4 star, than this is the place for you.  That being said, Luxor only starts check in at 3pm.  Meaning you can't check in when you get there you have to get in a long ass line which doesnt even start moving until 3pm-STUPID!  The rooms here are nice enough but can be noisy with all the low brow guests.  Catering to their clientelle there is actually a cheap fast food food court on the second floor LOL.  The service is friendly and the buffet was surprisingly good, Luxor is just not our cup of tea :)

Cool outlets a mile from Fremont street.  Lots of premium stores but also plenty of stores that you can afford as well.  The outlets were just about complete with the addition of several more stores and restaurants including Off Sax and Cheesecake Factory.  There is a large parking garage and a taxi and bus pick up drop off area as well.  One note the outlets are outdoors so get there early if you want to avoid the blistering summer heat.

This is not the fanciest buffet in Vegas but it is one of our least expensive favorites. Located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino Spice Marked puts on a good spread at a reasonable price.  The food is good quality and average to good in taste.  The real star of Spice Market is the large variety of moist yummy cupcakes in the desert station.  There is at least a dozen varieties of cupcakes!  The soft serve ice cream is the same Custard type of ice cream served in the Paris buffet and it is simply my fav.  There is also a Groupon currently available for two including "all you can drink" alcohol :)

This is the Cirque show of shows.  Amazing feats of water acrobatics and the pool constructed for the show is equally amazing. My only criticism is that I hated the clowns and the show dragged on a little bit too long.

This review is for Carlos Santana Performance only.  House of Blues music venue is pretty small setup and  when you get seated  it appears you have a pretty good view of the stage.  We were in row 208 section C seats 4-9.  I was in seat 4 and could easily see the front of the stage.  The name of the concert is Santana for the world famous highly skilled musician Carlos Santana.  What we could see was his entire band and a salt and pepper male singing duo.  What we did not see was Carlos Santana, the person EVERYBODY came to see.  Yes he was there, yes he was playing, but he practically hid in the far left corner of the stage 99.9% of the show.  Hmmm, so maybe House of Blues should instruct Mr Santana that the crowd paying $125 per ticket and more(price of our seats) are there to SEE him, not just hear him.  If I just wanted to listen to him I would have watched Youtube.  There was a camera man shooting live for the television screens but even that didn't focus on Carlos.  What I am typing might sound like bitter grapes, but trust me nobody on the left side of the stage was happy, most people were just as bored as me, yawning and not even looking at the stage or televisions.  Well maybe if we had purchased different seats the concert would be better-wrong! We left early and I checked the view from the center and right viewing areas and Mr Santana was very difficult to see from those vantages as well.  Mr Santana was virtually hiding from his fans way in the back left corner of the stage.  Santana's sets were also way too long.  Interesting upbeat music quickly devolved into boring noise as single songs turned into ten minute long ordeals.  Dude mix it up and keep your audience attentive not imprisoned.  I have seen almost every show in Vegas and the only show worse than this was the Legends of Music Tribute show at the Stratosphere which cost $20 and came with a free buffet !  I would highly recommend NOT seeing Santana unless you are a die hard fan willing to pay a lot of money to only hear him play.

This place is so cool!  There are crazy art pieces made of chocolate decorating the place along with goodies for sale to make your mouth water!  Its pretty much like being inside Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory :)  We sampled several baked goods and a mocha and everything looks and tastes as good as it looks!  Highly recommended!

After years of being passed up by the likes of Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal The Buffet was finally upgraded.  The overall decor looks exactly the same to me so I am not sure if the millions were spent here, but honestly all buffets pretty much look alike.  We only came here for lunch so most of the cooking stations were not open, the ones that I noticed  but were closed were a noodle station and a crepe station.  Food quality was very good here, the only thing that didn't look fresh to me was a couple of fish dishes and fish almost never looks fresh.  Our favorite dishes were the Korean Short Ribs, Pork loin, super sweet corn on the cob and sweet corn chowder.  The lychee ice cream was also a hit for me with real pieces of lychee in the yummy ice cream.  There wasn't much seafood or expensive cuts of meat available for lunch (no prime rib) but the prices were pretty reasonable.   Lunch was $27 and dinner is $40.  The Friday Seafood dinner is $50 which is pretty darn cheap for a high end Vegas buffet.  Overall we enjoyed this buffet, quality and service were good and pricing was affordable.  Although there wasn't any stand out dishes to make us yearn to come back this is a good choice for Vegas Buffets.

I saw this show on our honeymoon and I have to say it was very entertaining.  The mix of high energy drums and effects is great fun and would be an excellant Family show.

Hmmmm, not sure why this place is on some of the Vegas Best Buffets list as it was dreadfull.  We went for dinner and the line was pretty long about a 45 minute wait, so the food must be good right?  Well there were a few tasty items but overall the food wasnt very fresh or tasty.  Being in a hurry and exhausted after shopping we came back for lunch. OMG shocking the same food from dinner was there rotting away, the only thing I was brave enough to eat was caesar salad. The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!

The Grand Garden Arena plays host to all major events held at the MGM in Las Vegas.  The venue seats about 16,000 people and pretty much even the nose bleed seats have a good view of whatever attraction you might be there to see.  There isn't any annoying echoing from the sound system and seats are standard stadium style uncomfortable plastic seats.  There is a decent amount of rest rooms and vendors located inside the arena along with a ton of shops and restaurants along the walk to get to the arena itself.  This was our third event here and other than the pain in the butt of using Ticketmaster I have no complaints.

This is one of my favorite burgers in Vegas, the Zooza Burger, covered in delicious pastrami and cole slaw!  The Zooza eggs bene with pastrami is fabulous as well!  Side orders are just average and the line can build quickly as it is one of the earlier opening eateries in the casino.  I have to say the the extensive brass furnishing smell rusty and disgusting.

I have been staying here for work for the last couple of weeks and this is a nice place.  The rooms are large and quiet, however a walk in shower would be a great additional feature.  Who doesn't hate taking a shower in a bathtub!  I was able to stay as an Platinum Elite guest and have access to the complimentary lounge on the 12th floor.  You need a elite key to access the 12th floor and the lounge.  The lounge is pretty large with televisions, newspapers, free drinks along with daily breakfast, some hot entrees at dinner and deserts.  The hostess for the lounge works split shifts so she is there for 6am breakfast and 5:30pm dinner to great you with a welcome and a smile.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful whenever I needed assistance.  The Hotel itself is located across the street from the downtown amphitheater so it is a good spot to stay if your in town for a event or concert.  I haven't seen or done much in Phoenix but the Marriott seems like a pretty solid option for a stay.

Zip lines attached to the ceiling, music videos playing on the ceiling, street perfomers, three stages with live bands and or dj's, cheap food, cheap drinks, plenty of people to watch and in some cases laugh at, what more could you ask for?  This isn't the strip, but it is well worth a visit.

Do you know who Peter Lik is?  Well if you saw the movie "life of walter mitty" starring Ben Stiller, he seems alot like the photographer Sean Penn played in the movie.  Peter Lik takes astonishing 3d like photos of nature scapes in all of its profound glory.  One of his photo's sold for $1 million dollars!  Peter normally releases a proof set of 45 and then a limited set of 950 of each photo he releases. Every time 100 of the 950 prints sell the price goes up on the remaining prints.  At the end of the print run the price has basically doubled from around $4500 to $9000.  This is Peter's largest gallery although he has several in Vegas.  He also currently lives in Vegas and was described as being ADD even though he must be extremely patient when taking his breath taking photos.  It is impossible to describe the depth of colors and beauty Peter captures in his photos.  There is one photo of a zebra which I would swear its eye lashes were props applied to the photo, that's how crazy astounding these photos are. The prints are also made on special paper which contains silver which reacts according to the amount of lighting on the print ie the print changes its look according to how much light is on it.  Pricing also includes custom framing, matting, uv protected glass, tax and shipping.  While the big prices will keep some people from making a purchase here, I highly recommend visiting to admire this breathtaking work.

Located inside the Excalibur Casino, this show is surprisingly entertaining.  This show is literally fun for the whole family.  The arena is fairly small so no matter where you sit you will have a good seat.  We actually sat dead center in the front row and we were so close that we were almost hit by dirt thrown up by the horses as they galloped by!  One great aspect of this show is the Feast!  Our waiter was so good we couldn't take more than a couple drinks from our glasses before he zipped by and refilled them!  Dinner included: tomato soup, Cornish game hen, roasted potatoes, broccoli, a dinner roll and a pop tart shaped apple crisp for desert.  Dinner did not include eating utensils as you are forced to drink your soup from a bowl and eat with your hands like the good ole days!  The food was surprisingly good!  The cornish game hen basically tasted like a small broiled chicken, hot, juicy, tender and seasoned perfectly.  The show is basically a bunch of josting knights, dancing gypsies and the classic good vs evil battle with a slight twist.  Although my girls were highly skeptical including my 12 yr old daughter who texted her friends saying "we were making her go" said she loved the show and it was "awesome"  Kudo's to the Excalibur for putting on a great show and meal.

Located in the shopping area which connects Paris to Bally's this is a medium to large size burger bar.  There are several televisions and one large projection screen for viewing sports while enjoying burgers and drinks.  There is a full service bar and  bar seating as well as tables and booths.    The menu consists primarily of burgers, a few salads, appetizers, shakes, drinks and a couple of sides.  Prices for burgers run in the $14-18 dollar range along with a gimmick "777" burger which costs $777.  I tried to ask our server about it, but she wasn't listening to me, a theme which continued throughout the night. My wife had the bleu burger which came with bacon, and a delicious house made sesame bun.  I have never seen so much bleu cheese on a burger and although I enjoy bleu cheese on burgers and steaks there was way to much cheese.  My wife had to scrape off the excess cheese.  The burger itself was cooked perfectly with a little pink in the center.  I ordered the No Bones Rib Sandwich.  It was served on the same house made sesame roll and when I picked it up it weighed a ton.  Seriously that sandwich weighed at least a pound. There was a large amount of boneless rib meat, onion strings and some type of pickled cabbage or slaw.  The sandwich looked and sounded better than it tasted though.  Unfortunately if was just okay for me.  We ordered a side of fries to share and were hoping for the thin crispy delicious fries served in the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, but unfortunately we got plain old fries which broke in half every time we tried to dip them in the tasty spicy ketchup that it came with.  The highlight of our meal were the alcoholic shakes. We ordered the cookies and cream and mint chocolate shakes which were pretty tasty for $8 each.  Although Holsteins and Burgr serves better shakes these were pretty good and cheaper than the other two places.  Our server was friendly and attentive but irritatingly only spoke and listened to my wife.  Now I have worked in food service before and I know that female servers will often focus on the female when serving couples as to not risk the female thinking the server was flirting with her man, but this was just outright being ignored. Perhaps the skimpy outfits the servers wear played a part in this, but for me this was just BAD service.  Our food also took at least 20 minutes to come out even though the place was not busy.  Overall even with the $20 for $40 Groupon we still spent $40 after tip.  We had a burger, a sandwich, one order of fries and two shakes. Without the Groupon our bill would have been $60 assuming a 20% tip.  With all the great burger places in Vegas I can't recommend coming here and paying these prices for average food.

I have always wondered what the heck is this place cuz there is always a giant crowd here.  Well we finally checked this spot out and now we know why this place is always busy.  There is nothing fancy or Vegas like about this cafeteria style Sammie spot,  no crazy menu, no neon lights, not even girls in skimpy outfits lol.  Earl of Sandwich does deliver some great tasty Sammies for a cheap $6.99.  We ordered the Tuna Melt which was perfection, light soft crispy bread with gooey Swiss and tuna salad.  I coul eat this Sammie everyday of the week.  We also tried the roast beef Sammie which was named the 1762 or something close to that.  The beef was so tender it literally melted in our mouths. The cheddar cheese and sweet spicy horseradish sauce complimented the tender beef perfectly.   The only bad thing I can say about Earl of Sandwich is that the sammies are on the smaller side and you might need more than one if you are a big eater.  Don't wait any longer to try this place it is worth standing in line for and it won't dent your wallet.

This is a solid attractive resort. The rooms are well appointed and the hotel location is decent although towards the end of the strip. Directly connected to its sister hotel Venetian Palazzo shares attactions such as eaterys and shops.  This is a nice hotel however there are nicer less expensive options available.

Located in the middle of Monte Carlo Casino, Brand is easy enough to find :)  Although this is a typical upscale steak house it has Vegas style open seating meaning you can sit along a half wall and watch people go or have people watch you eat as they walk by, not my preference.  Fortunately there are more secluded booths farther back in the restaurant.  Decorated in dark wood with dim lighting Brand certainly looks the part of "steakhouse" There is a full service bar and lounge area as well which showcases half priced apps and reduced drinks for Happy Hour.  We ordered the Prime Rib and added a lobster tail.  The normal cut 12 ounces was $35 and the lobster tail was an additional $25.  I ordered the large cut which was 16 ounces and cost $39.00.  The prime was tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, seasoned well and just darn Yummy.  Au Jus and creamy horseradish came along with the prime.  The lobster tail was about 6-8 ounces and also steamed perfectly.  Accompanied by melted butter, there was a hidden surprise inside the lobster tail shell was a cornbread type stuffing flavored with lobster bits.  The stuffing was scrumdelicious and made for a perfect bite paired with the sweet lobster.  Sides averaged $9-12 each and they had a special of 3 for $25. We tried the loaded potato, mushrooms and green beans.  The potato and mushrooms were good, but the green beans were way to "Al Dente" for us, our server swapped the beans out for creamed spinach. All the sides were good and the mushrooms in particular were very good :)  Although we didn't have room for desert, we did look at the menu and prices are only $10 per desert so don't worry about desert breaking the bank if you have room to order some. Service was prompt and friendly without the "attitude" you sometimes receive in more expensive eateries.  I highly recommend trying Brand if you are looking for a good steakhouse in Vegas.  Brand has quality food and service and very reasonable prices to boot!

Encore is pretty much a new extension of the Wynn.  That being said the suites at Encore are appointed in what I would call art deco and have a more modern feel. Other than that everything is the same as the Wynn. Once again if you dont find a good deal it is pricey to stay here.

I have often heard the tales of the Brazilian Steakhouse where delicious meats are brought to your table and carved off of a Skewer onto your plate and now I can confirm these legends are true.  We came for lunch today after a few days of business meetings, located off the strip but only about 10 minutes away.  The buliding was large and beautifully decorated. Bright and roomy with lots of natural lighting and dark wood tables.  To begin your meal you can induldge in a wonderful 60 item salad bar which included among other things: cubes of smoked salmon, shrimp, proscuito, sliced parmesan, crunchy bacon and a myriad of other delicious items.   Lunch also includes small cheesy bread balls, garlic mashed potatoes and fried bananas. Then when you turn your two sided two colored placard over from red to green the feast begins!  We were served: flank steak, a house special sirloin, garlic sirloin, fillet, bbq pork ribs, lamb chops, leg of lamb, parmesan chicken, bacom wrapped chicken and possibly some other items that I cant remember :)  Most of the meats were flavorful and delicious.  You may have as much as you want and fresh cuts of meat are constantly brought out, basically it is a grand feast!  Lunch was about $25 and was a bargain since the same foods are served at dinner for $50.  I highly reccomend trying this delicious entertaining feast.

Vdara is located in the new City Center of Vegas and it is a hidden gem.  Located at the back of the city center Vdara does not have a casino.  Since Vdara doesnt have a casino you can stay in their absolutely beautiful suites for less than Aria or Cosmopolitan.  The suites have floor to ceiling windows with electric powered shades/drapes, a kichten, dining table and living room area.  One of the coolest features is the studio like design of the suite.  The Bed is seperated by a wall housing a flat screen and drawers etc.  The wall is open on both ends so it doesnt close in the room. On the opposite side of the wall is your sofa, chairs, coffee table and another flat screen tv!  Vdara has been our favorite place to stay in Vegas for our last several trips. Although we are testing out Monte Carlo and Aria next month :)

We popped into this place to have a look see, what we found was an ultra exclusive very expensive hotel!  The hallways are kept really dark almost like walking through a temple.  Not much to see if your staying there as there is only a coffee shop and an exclusive restaraunt availble for publc eyes.

We visted this place several years ago and throughly enjoyed it. I would have rated it 3.5-4 stars back then.  Oh how the mighty have fallen. On our recent trip we had dinner here and it was bad!  Alot of the food was old and cold. The king crab legs tasted like salt licks and a large number of other dishes were too scary looking to try. The prime rib and desert section was Aria's only saving grace. The gelato was housed in a revolving freezer that sort of reminded my of a Ice Cream Pistol LOL.  Avoid eating here as this is no longer a good buffet.  There is an all you can drink option for beer and wine for $12.99.  I suppose if you drink enough the food might taste better LMAO  The lobster shown in photos is availble on Fridays and I think Saturday, the price is considerably higher and you are limited to 1/2 lobster tail per person.

Odd, with all the super fancy highly rated buffets around Vegas, I found this one to be one of my favorites.  The price is cheap and the food quality is good.  This place wont blow you away with fancy selections like Kobe beef etc but what they do, they do well.  I especially love the soft serve custard, no not ice cream or yogurt, custard.

I have been a fan of Jabbawockeez since they first on appeared on "Americas Best Dance Crew".  Mind blowing dancing, acrobatics and fresh choreography were their calling card. Of course Jabbawockeez won Americas Best Dance Crew as well.  Originally playing at the Monte Carlo, Jabbawockeez now perform at the Luxor. The theater is fairly small as far as Vegas goes so all the seats had a good view.  Since the show wasn't full everybody was moved to better seating as they came in.  In the end we were in the fourth row a little bit off center but really close.    The show was based on Ying and Yang with a dancer representing Black and White and the harmony they bring when they are equally balanced.  The show also starred dancers of the color spectrum: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Violet.  Without giving everything away I will say the show was quite entertaining and full of clever and unexpected plot and dance moves.  The music at Jabbawockeez is REALLY loud and if you don't wanna feel some bass in your chest you should sit in the back :)  Luxor is part of the MGM group and they run different show ticket promotions all the time.  The promo we used to buy these tickets was buy one show get another show free but we have used stay three nights and get free show tickets many times in Vegas as well.    If you like loud music, good fun and great dancing I highly recommend this show.

The best thing about Wicked Spoon Buffet is how they put all the food into the sexiest lttle presentation packages to make you think youre not in a buffet!  I love buffets and this one is pretty good.  I would say my fav was the mac n cheese build a bar and the desserts are Fab.

Wicked Spoon is still one of the best buffets in Vegas.  The decor still looks brand new with no signs of wear and tear.  The food is still good quality and served in attractive non buffet small plates which Wicked Spoon pioneered here in Vegas.  If you don't feel like biting the $52 per person bill at Baccahnal Wicked Spoon is a good option.

This is the coolest place to shop on the strip.  There is a good mix of high end and medium retailers here.  The drawbacks being it is difficult fo find your way out of this maze and food is very expensive inside.  Still our favorite place to shop in Vegas though.  I am not sure but I think the Statue of the God's show and other statues that came to life are currently not running :(

Located next door to Burger Bar inside Mandalay's shopping area, Slice is a large eatery with full bar, several televisions and a varied menu.  Service was prompt and friendly as there was quite a few servers working for early Saturday lunch shift.  Slice offers, pizza's, pasta, sandwiches, salads and burgers.  We tried a burger and a Philly cheese steak sammie.  Both entree's came with choice of sweet potato or regular fries.  We both got sweet potato fries and the portions were huge!  Both of our sammies were well cooked big and flavorful not to mention the prices were considerably cheaper than Burger Bar.    One cool item we noticed was the big glass beer taps you can order and have placed on your table or in front of you at the bar.  Basically at least a yard size glass tube with its own tap on the bottom so you can pour your own glass, totally cool.  I strongly recommend trying this place if your stuck in Mandalay and want to eat some place good but still affordable.

Located in the Southwest Terminal B Eistein Bros Bagels has a decent menu: Breakfast wraps, Lunch wraps, bagels, breakfast bagels, bagel sandwiches, coffee drinks, fresh juices etc.    There was also a pretty large staff on hand for a Saturday morning to make your food quickly.  Unfortunately the food and drinks come out scorching hot. My breakfast wrap and caramel latte were practically burning my hands and there was no way you could eat or drink them til they cooled down.  My wrap contained, eggs, turkey sausage, pepper jack cheese and salsa.  The wrap was supposed to have jalapeno smear, but it came with salsa instead.  The only thing I could taste was the salsa.  I took a bite out of the egg and sausage separately and they pretty didn't taste like anything.  My coffee was also very sweet.  Prices are pretty reasonable for airport food, but we will not be trying this place again.

Yes Yes Yes, I will have Bacchanal Buffet!  So Ceasars spent $25 million dollars trying to create the buffet of all buffets.  I would have to say "HAIL CAESAR" for they have succeeded!  There was about a 25-30 minute wait to get into the modern and beautifully decorated buffet. There was honestly too much food to even try and attempt to describe but the main stations consisted of the following:  Asian food including sushi, bbq ribs, dim sum and a mongolian style grill.  Italian food including expensive cuts of italian lunch meats, and some pretty darn delicious thin crust pizzas. Hot meat station, prime rib, lamb chops, flank steak, rib eye, sausages and more. Seafood including King Crab sliced in half, lobster chowder with huge chunks of lobster, shrimp, cerviches etc.  Mexican food including a street taco station. Fried chicken with sweet potato fries, Fish n Chips and many many more foods that I cant even remember.  There was also a huge dessert section with souffles and crepes made to order.  You really need several trips to this buffet in order to sample the vast amount of delicious items this place has to offer. Even my vast stomach couldnt make enough room to try everything.  Dinner cost $50 per person and was worth every penney, but for a mere $70 you can buy the 24 hour pass and come back to Bacchanal and other buffets as many times as you like in the 24 hour time period.  In sum, if your in Vegas you must try the new king of all buffets and visit Bacchanal.

HMMMM, changes being made here as Ceasars tries to figure out how to make money at this buffet.  First off prices have gone up!  Dinner is $46.95 mon-thur and $54.95 fri-sun.  You can still buy a 24 hour buffet pass but it is no longer worthwhile if you intend to use it on Bacchanal.  The pass is $55 plus $25 extra EVERY time you eat at Bacchanal whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner.  In effect it is cheaper just to pay the regular price if you intend to eat at Bacchanal more than once.  Portion size has also been changed for a few items, the lobster corn chowder is in a smaller ramakin and no longer contains large pieces of lobster.  The made to order souffles are no longer in a ramakin and are being baked in foil cups, leading to the soufflies being over cooked.  The changes being made are sort of alarming as it makes you wonder if Caesar's will be able to continue this fabulous buffet or will quality suffer down the road.

Circue really delivers with this show!   Instead of the same old thing, 80% of the show was things I have never seen before.  Considering I have seen every Circue and Cirque knock off show that is quite an accomplishment.  The sets used for the show utilized modern technology and were quite impressive.  The best part of the show was a artist who painted using sand on top of a glass screen which was simultaneously projected onto a screen so the audience could watch.  This part of the show was simply amazing and worth the price of admission by itself.  I highly recommend seeing this show.

Lets see if gordons food equals his talk, well Ramsay delivers here.  The burgers were very juicy and tasty.  The venue itself is pretty casual most of the staff wearing weird Jetson's looking uniforms and all of them looked like they were fresh out of highschool.  The place is pretty noisy since it is located inside Planet Hollywood and there are no sound barrier walls, you can pretty much watch people walk by in the casino as you sit inside BurGR.  We tried the following:  Hells Kitchen Burger: avocado, cheese and some other items that just blended in.  The burger was moist, juicy and delicious however the toppings all sort of blended together. Britania Burger: sharp cheddar, mango salsa, arugula this burger was pretty good with the ingrediants playing well off of each other. The mango salsa is on the sweet side so dont order this if you dont have a sweet tooth. Maui parmesan onion rings: crispy, sweet onions with cheese-yumm.  These were some very well executed and delicious onion rings. Peanut Butter Shake: OMG the best thing at BurGR's are the shakes!  This one had alot of peanut butter in it and it was super yummy but very filling! Coffee Shake: this one had hazlenut pudding which I dont like, but my wife probably would have killed me if I had tried to take this from her LOL  Prices: burgers are about $14  shakes $11 onion rings $9  You also recieved $1 off all prices if you have a MGM Total Rewards Card.  NOTE: if you and your co-yelper are light eaters you can easily get by ordering one burger, one shake and one side.  The sides give large portions and the shakes are super filling.

We came here at 6pm to pick up our Mayweather vs Pacquaio Fight Tickets.  I expected a long line since hundreds of fight tickets had been sold on Stub Hub what I found was a great surprise.   A decent sized parking lot, security visible and a staff that shredded the line and produced my tickets in less than 5 minutes!  I highly recommend Stub Hub for third party ticket sales.

What a cool spot on Fremont Street.  The Park has outdoor seating in front so you can people watch, indoor seating, bar seating and patio seating.  The staff dresses in a sort of western theme adding a little charm to the joint.    Our server was great, fast, friendly, helpful and efficient.  Unfortunately she did give us some bad news:  The secret menu item: Lobster Sliders are no longer served. We had seen them on Adam Richmond's secret menu item show on the Travel Channel  and we were really looking forward to devouring them-POO!  We settled on the Mac n Cheese balls $8 and the Chicken n Waffle Sammie $13.  The Mac n Cheese balls were golf ball sized scoops of panko crusted, deep fried mac n cheese with jalapeno and bacon too boot.  One bite of that crispy, creamy goodness and we were transported to mac n cheese heaven.  My wife doesn't even like mac n cheese and I was forced to share them with her cuz they were that darn good LMAO!  The chicken and waffle sammie holds two deep fried chicken breasts and a healthy portion of crispy bacon.  I am not a fan of chicken and waffles but this concoction was still pretty tasty.  We were sorely tempted to come back and try the garbage fries and burgers here, but we didn't get a chance to make it back.  Next trip we will definitely be back.

Who would have thunk that Bobby's Burger Palace smack dab in the City Center on the Vegas Strip and not attached or associated with a casino would be one of the most affordable places to eat at!  Hat's off to Mr Flay!  Mind you the prices were on average $2.21 more than what the email menu I received from Bobby's news letter was but at $9 per burger that is still cheap in Vegas terms :)  The location is mid sized but makes good use of space with cool cafeteria style bench seating.  There is probably room for around 100 people or so.  The ordering system is cafeteria style as well, ordering at the register and then having your food brought out to you.  The menu is fairly basic other than the 5 or six gourmet burgers offered.  I think there was a grilled cheese on the menu, sweet potato fries, regular fries, onion rings, milk shakes and frozen alcoholic drinks as well.  We sampled the following:  La Burger: about a 1/3 pound super juicy burger served with your choice of cheese and a avocado relish.  The burger was tasty and filling $9.00.  Crunch Burger: a cheese burger served with potato chips inside. My daughter loved this burger saying it was one of the best she has ever had.  You can "crunchify" any burger for a small charge.  $8.50  Dallas Burger: a cheese burger served with coleslaw and bbq sauce.  Juicy tender and cooked to perfection this was a good burger $9.00  Onion Rings: super wide cut onion rings in a light batter.  The rings were very juicy when you bit into them but didn't come with any special dipping sauce and could have used more seasoning in the batter $4.00  Sweet Potato Fries: a large portion of tasty fries served with a honey mustard dipping sauce, could have been crispier but they were good $4.00  Dark Chocolate Milk Shake: a thick tasty shake, but not worth $6.50  Overall we really enjoyed this place.  The burgers are not the best on the strip but they are certainly the most affordable gourmet burger on the strip.  Stay away from the over priced shakes and you will leave here with a full belly and some spare cash in your wallet :)

So I am in town for some work and we decided to check out this new spot.  Since I am not from Phoenix, I can't really tell you where the heck Barrio Queen is, but I can tell you to come check it out!    Tuesdays are Taco Tuesdays and all tacos are $2.50 each. Normally tacos are 3 for $10.00.  The beauty of Taco Tuesdays is that you can try several of the 12-15 types of taco on the cheap.  There were several tacos that I had never heard of in California, such as carne asada and fried egg, carne asada and chili relleno, chorizo and egg etc.  I had four of their fat street tacos: Carnitas, Fish, carne asada egg and carne asada chili relleno.  Every one of those tacos was delicious.  The meats were smokey and full of flavor.  The produce was fresh and gave a good crunch.  The egg was cooked a perfect medium so when you bit into it, the egg provided a creamy goodness over the carne asada.  Everything was so good, I really wished I had room to try some more tacos!  We also ordered the Churros which were too large crispy sticks covered in cinnamon and sugar served with ice cream and the most delectable caramel I have ever had.  The caramel was the real star here as it was thick with a deep caramel flavor.  Seriously, we even thought about licking the plate it was so good! Sorry I forgot to take a photo of the churros!  Great service is a key ingredient in any five star review and the staff was top notch here.  Given it was very early and there was nobody there, but every staff member who walked past our table cleared plates, brought chips or checked on us.  Our server also brought everyone at the table small samples of the house fruit drinks to taste, what a nice surprise.  The house chips and salsa are also very good.  The chips are thick enough that they provide fantastic crunch but not hard enough to break your teeth.    Overall we loved the experience here and I am really going to miss not having a Barrio Queen back in Sacramento.  If your here in AZ check em out!
