I'm staying here for about a week.  24 hours of free shuttle service that takes you anywhere, within a 5 miles radius. All of the staffs are very friendly and helpful. They have a heated pool, that's open until midnight. So go out for a little swim and get a tan while you're at it. There's also a hidden jacuzzi by the pool. :)  The beds are really high. I don't understand how kids would climb on the beds, without the help of an adult.. Also one of the shuttle driver (Carlos) was such a creep. After dropping me off he had went out near my room for a smoke. Next thing I get a call in my room. Guess who? Carlos the shuttle driver! What a creep! The next day the staffs apologizes and said it's a normal thing for Carlo.   Anyways, I've had that situation dealt with. Overall I wouldn't mind staying in this resort again. It's very close by everything. Everything you need is basically a block away. There's a Denny's and a circle K right across the street, very convenient.

I came in trying to order something and they couldn't understand my order. It took 3 ppI to finally get it right. So I just  ordered the #34 (com bi cha Suon nuong), w/ a bowl of broth. First of all they didn't bring me everything that was listed for #34.. I didn't understand why they served a salad without the dressing. ?__?  The food was just okay, I'm definitely not satisfied with my choice, but this restaurant was recommended by friends. I guess if I ever come back, it would be for a bowl of soup (you can't go wrong with a bowl of pho).  Yes this restaurant is nice, but I felt like I should have went elsewhere.  Supposedly this place is open 24 hrs,  that's pretty convenient.

Yumm! That definitely hit the spot.  I was a bit confused by their menu, but it's pretty simple. There's not that much to choose from, but everything on there is G O O D!!  I had the combo and 1 dollar soda (free refills). This is a moms and pops shop. I love it!! It totally deserves a 5 star. C'mon ppl!!!

I love this place! Talk about food coma! This place is always busy. I had to wait about an hour to be seated. I went next door to the billiards and the guy was nice enough to let me use their spare phone charger. lol..... He also had a menu and reccomended some dishes.  I of course had the crispy duck with panang. Yummy! I also had the tom khai soup with that. Loved it! I'll be back for some more.

First timers and my friend's first experience with k-BBQ! We got here around 7PM on a Sunday night. It wasn't busy. It was nice and quiet. We order bulgogi between 2 ppl and kimchi soup. Wow! It was delicious!!! The service was also good. We did have to go get all of the side dishes ourselves, but that wasn't much of an issue.

My significant other and I had a great combo massage here. It was clean and safe. My massage felt great and if i was in AZ again, I'll definitely come back. :D

Very well put together salon. One of the nicest one I've been too. Such a pretty layout and design. My nails were pretty and I did a glittery white pedi. It was very pretty and lasted a very long time. I would say 3 weeks +   Overall a great experience and i'll stop by again whenever I'm in Vegas. =)
