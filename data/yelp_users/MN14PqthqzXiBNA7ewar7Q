The fish seemed to be those pre-formed square frozen patties that are sold in the frozen section of the grocery store. Not good as I was expecting real fish filets for the price charged.  The fries were ok, but I suspect also frozen. Also, join the 21st century and start accepting ATM cards. I won't be back. :(

Great food. Awesome beer. Interesting atmosphere. Great staff. Becoming a regular hang out. Try the crunchy tacos or San Antonio mac n cheese. Take a growler of ale home.

We usually like this chain for a good hearty country breakfast, but our last visit was a real disappointment.   The waitress was pretty indifferent. Got the order wrong. Had to be asked twice for a glass of water.   The hash browns were under cooked. Almost raw potatoes. The chicken fried steak was dry. I asked for the gravy on the side. Didn't get it at all. The toast was cold and soggy.   In all, not worth the $26 check for two breakfasts.

This is bar-none our favorite place to eat in the Goodyear/Avondale area.  The food is great! If you are afraid to eat spicy food, don't worry! Many selections from the menu are not hot. This is authentic "Nawlins" eating! The stereotype that Cajun is hot food is not true. It is well seasoned. Garlicy, sweet, sour, hot, salty. The gamut of flavors depending on what you order.  Everything is fresh and delicious. I have had the fried pickles, hush puppies, red beans and rice, shrimp creole and the shrimp Étouffée. My friends had the Po boys made with gator. All of it was fantastic.  The service is great, except for one time the staff was busy with a large birthday party and kinda forgot about us. However, as soon as they realized what was happening, they were very attentive. Otherwise, nice food servers who know the menu and can recommend with authority.  Order the Beignets. And sweet tea.  Next time I want to try the jambalaya and peach cobbler.

First time here. Greeted promptly. Menu can be confusing. Clean comfortable surroundings. Contemporary decor instead of the phony Asian motif. Soft jazz music.   The staff members were all very nice.   I ordered the chicken lo mein with pot stickers and veggie spring rolls.   The chicken was tender and nicely seasoned. Fresh cooked to order. Hot and fresh. Soft delicate noodles, enhanced with mushrooms, carrot and green onion. Tasty sauce that was sweet and ginger-like.   Delicious side dishes. The pot stickers are deep fried and not the ordinary pan fry. Crispy spring rolls filled with not too crunchy veggies. Both sides served with dipping sauce.   Jars of hot chili sauce are provided if you like a spicy bite.   Serving size of the main dish was plenty. They also have a smaller portion size available.   Unlike Panda Express, which is more cafeteria style, here you are served at your table with real plates and flat ware.    Regular bowl of lo mein $8.69, 2 spring rolls $3.79, 2 pot stickers $1.99.   Thank God no nasty dry fortune cookies forced on me. What a relief!

Nice clean restaurant with delicious food served fast and fresh.   The pizza tastes just like it did when we were in Brooklyn.   Order up front and they will bring it to your table. Reasonably priced.   Not just pizza. Several Italian dishes just like Mama's.

Jack Clubman got his first scheduled (now, read that word the Brit way) maintenance today at Mini of Tempe.  We want to thank Steven Pham, our Service Consultant, and all of the crew at MOT for providing us with a great experience. Everyone was very welcoming and attentive to our needs and the facility is beautiful.  Jack was serviced nicely and even got a wash and vacuuming.  If you are in the greater Phoenix area, we highly recommend Mini of Tempe.  www.minioftempe.com

Butt Out is by far the best vape store we found in Phoenix so far.   The staff is friendly and welcoming and are very knowledgable about their products and vaping in general.  They have a nice selection of products and some of the best tasting, high quality juices I've ever tasted.   The store is comfortable and lounge-like. Cool, funky wall mural and art work.

Nice selection of quality merchandise, as well as less expensive starter kits. Friendly staff (two young ladies who were very attentive), who seemed new to the vaping world, but trying to learn. Clean, modern upscale store. Juices available to sample, but kept behind the counter (Maybe that's a good thing).  Yes, stuff is usually cheaper on the Internet, but who can compete with a factory in China who pays their workers 10cents an hour? I prefer to pay a bit more and get the stuff immediately and keep the money in Arizona's economy (You should too!).

Excellent service! Very good, fresh food! Clean, upscale decor.   The food was all fresh cooked to order. Seasoned just right, except for the egg rolls, which I thought were a bit too peppery. Overall, very delicious. My favorite was the fried shrimp. Not rubbery as most places serve it. Nothing tasted greasy, even the fried foods.  Large quantity served, so come hungry or prepare to take home lot's of leftovers.   Our server was very sweet and got the order right. Kept our water and tea glasses full.   They display an A rating from the health dept., and it shows. You can see the kitchen from the dining area, and it looks very clean.  Reasonable prices. We paid $40 for dinner for two, including tip, and we took home enough for another meal.  This is a new place so they don't have a beer/wine license yet.

The food is delicious. Reasonably priced. The restaurant itself could use a good cleaning and organizing. It looks like they gave up in the middle of a remodel or repair. The girl at the counter was very sweet.   The beef in the tacos is succulent and flavorful. Nice crispy shells without being tough. The beans and rice were seasoned nicely and cooked properly.   They have a very complete menu with lots of choices.
