Arrived here around lunch time and the place was charming, but was completely empty. There wasn't even a waitress anywhere in sight. We seated ourselves and a couple minutes later the waitress came out. At first I thought why is this place so empty, but I would find out soon enough. The waitress was moody and gave us attitude when we asked her questions almost as if we were stupid for asking. We had a living social coupon and no where on it did it say that we had to order from the dinner menu, but apparently that was the case. We ordered our food, Cuban sandwich, mussels, arroz con pollo, and a salad. It was good, but not great for the prices we were paying. Just as an example the Cuban sandwich is $15...I think I paid $6 out $7 for a really good Cuban sandwich in Miami. Sad to say I probably will not be going back.

Every time I come here at the end of the month to pay rent they only have 2 tellers and a bunch of other "personal bankers" just standing around or taking their sweet time chatting with everyone. The parking is also awful.

I was craving pizza so I hopped onto Yelp to see what pizza places were highly rated and close to my home in Tempe. Venezia's caught my eye as I had driven by it many times and it had good reviews on yelp. Hopped in the car and headed there. It had a pretty steady crowd which was a good sign. I thought I would order a whole pizza, but then while in online I got into a dilemma. Should I order a whole pie or get slices and try several different types of pizzas. Since I couldn't decide on one pizza I went with 3 slices and even those were hard to decide on since they had so many choices. I had to get a plain cheese slice as you can never go wrong with the classic. I also chose a spicy pepperoni slice and a pesto slice. The slices were great and quite big. I think 2 slices would have been enough, but I chose the third one cause I had to try more. The place was nice and big enough for groups. It also was lined with TVs in case you wanted to watch a sports event so that was cool.

I must start off by saying I LOVE pizza! Probably one of my favorite foods and because I travel a lot for work I always try to check out the local pizza place. Ever since moving to Tempe 2 years prior I had seen that Pizzeria Bianco was a highly rated pizza place in Phoenix. Over 1k reviews and a famous chef...needless to say I had been wanting to go here in a bad way, but just never had found the time or a reason to go. Pizza craving kicked in and in no mood to cook...this was the day! Woot! When we arrived I was surprised to see how small the place is. I had heard there are long lines to get in and now I could understand why. We got there at the perfect time though and were seated immediately. It was an early dinner. Needless to say that before we left, the line started forming outside. As we were seated we were handed the menu. Is this all? 1 page? Ok well that definitely makes it easier to order. Only 6 pizza choices really? At first this seems disappointing, but keep in mind these are 6 pizzas that you probably wont see at most places. Hmm even though there were only 6, I wanted to try all of them! Dang it! Our solution was to order 2 pizzas and get them both half and half...4 flavors covered! These are the 4 we tried: SONNY BOY (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, olives); MARGHERITA (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil); MARINARA (Tomato Sauce, Oragano, Garlic (No Cheese)); and WISEGUY (Wood-Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage). I didn't get to try the Biancoverde or the Rosa, but I vow to go back for those. All 4 pizza flavors were great, but the one that stood out the most was the Sonny Boy. My only complaint is the price of the pizza. Yes it was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had and they weren't huge pizzas. Pizza in places like New Haven, CT is just as good, yet much cheaper. Or I've even been to Neopolitan pizza places that had amazing pizza for a lower price. I feel that they charge you a premium for the Bianco brand experience of pizza. With that being said I would go back as I still haven't found anything better in Phoenix.

Family was in town and they couldn't decide what to eat, so i asked them to name some foods they liked. They named Mexican and Chinese food so I hopped on trusty Yelp to search for something to eat. Chinese/Mexican fusion? Hmm, now this I had to try! When I pulled up to the place I was instantly hesitant as the exterior looked quite unimpressive. I walked in and it was even less impressive, but the place was packed! Were they giving away free food? The dining room looked like a school cafeteria...why would so many people be here. I then caught a whiff of the food...mmmm! Hopped in line and then started to decipher the menu posted on the wall. I was a little confused. Jade Red chicken Quesadilla? Jerk Chicken Burrito? Why had I not thought of Chinese food in a burrito before?! Mind blown! Ordered both of these in a combo form which were accompanied by pork fried rice. The Jerk chicken was quite spicy, but  full of flavor. The jade red chicken had good balance and was probably the one I enjoyed more of the 2. To top it all off, the place gives you a free snickerdoodle cookie. The prices were incredibly cheap and the amounts of food were really good. Definitely recommend the place.

Coffee here is always cool! The wait can be lengthy at times, but they make up for it with great conversation and friendliness! Definitely has a more personal feel than most coffee shops. If you haven't been to Dutch Bros, you need to try it!

My GF loves Indian food, me well not so much as it always seems to upset my stomach...guess I'm not accustomed to all the spices that are used in Indian food. Maybe that was TMI?? Moving on...having just moved to Tempe I wanted to take my gf somewhere to eat and since she loves Indian food I did a search on Yelp.   The Dhaba appeared to be a top Indian spot according to yelpers. I had seen it days before driving by it as it is hard to miss. It hardly looks like a place that would serve Indian food and rather more resembles some quirky old time western place from the outside. I questioned whether it would be good based on this alone. Surprisingly the whole plaza is "Indian" in some way. Indian market, Indian restaurant, and an Indian cafe. Wow! I probably would not have come here if it weren't for the exceptional reviews.  Once you walk into the Dhaba, the restaurant is quaint and beautifully decorated. It was busy, yet the atmosphere was quiet. The hostess was attentive and the service was great.   The food was wonderful. Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of Indian food, but I ordered the Chicken Tikka and I loved it. The portions were big, so unless you have a large appetite you'll most likely have leftovers.   The food was a little pricey, but it was worth it. I look forward to going back again...

Walked in and the place did not look like a normal Mexican food place, but it did look interesting. I was intrigued. Lemons? Hmm...   I stared at the menu for a few minutes and finally decided on the Organic Black Bean Burrito...not my usual choice, but I didn't really feel like any meat that day. The Organic Black Bean Burrito also had an amazing description that made me want to try it. It read as follows "Organic black beans seasoned with cumin, garlic, and Mexican spices. Includes pico de gallo and our custom cheese blend." Ok now that I read it the next day it doesn't sound that amazing, so maybe I was just hungry... It did taste wonderful though! The portions weren't too crazy and the homemade tortilla chips that accompanied it went very well with the hot salsa.   So apparently this place also makes a few different types of fresh lemonade. Upon asking the girl at the front what she recommended I went with the white peach lemonade and wow it was awesome! My only complaint for the lemonade was that it was a tad pricey and the cup isn't that large...I was left wanting more!!!  Definitely check this place if you're in the area...

Ever since I moved to Tempe 2 months ago I had driven past this place numerous times and kept wondering what their food would be like. My family and I finally decided we would go try it out. Definitely was not the fanciest place and inside it was full of smoke. Not a problem...at least I know they are cooking the meat right. I ordered the bean and cheese burrito with guacamole inside and America's way which meant it would have diced roasted jalapenos inside. They didn't have any sour cream which I thought was strange. The drink choices were also slim.   Upon receiving my order, the XL bean and cheese burrito, I was a little disappointed because it didn't seem much bigger than a regular size burrito and yet it was like like $2 more. My burrito was just lukewarm and although I dont want it scalding hot it would be nice to have it warmer than what it was. By the time I was done eating it was definitely cold...quite disappointing again! My GF ordered the Chorizo burrito which she was very pleased with. Her only complaint was that everything was blended together that it was hard to distinguish the tastes of the ingredients. My dad ordered the Al pastor burrito and that was cold as well. :( My mom's carne asada burrito was lukewarm, but she seemed to be ok with it.  I'm hoping it was just a bad day for the crew as the place seemed like it would be good based on some of the reviews. It was slow and perhaps the crew was just slacking off that day...

Ok so before I moved to Tempe I had seen this place on the ever so awesome show Man Vs Food as well as America's best sandwiches. Of course I had to go here and try it right?! When we sat down and got the menu I saw that this place was more than just Tortas (Mexican style sandwiches). They had a very extensive menu. Oh man what the heck was I going to order with so many choices. I'm not a decisive person so when i get a huge menu it makes it really hard on me. Ugghhh! But wait this place has Torta in their name and every time I had seen them on TV it was a Torta the foodie celeb was eating so that was what I would order as well! I wasnt about to try the Man vs Food Torta called the Torta King Carlos V priced at over $20, but this is because it can feed a small village. Nope not for me. I would instead choose the other sandwich which came out in America's best sandwich list...the Torta Del Rey. The sandwich consisted of the following: Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage and Mexican sausage come with tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce, smear of refried beans and potatoes ruffles on the side. That sounds like a lot yumminess in between 2 pieces of bread. Wait how do they even fit all of that in a sandwich? They're joking right...Not at all! This thing is huge and just under $10...oh my! Whoever thought of this is a genius cause it tasted amazing! The only downfall is the thing is huge and hard to keep together. Gets quite messy for sure, but the experience is pleasurable throughout. Last of all the service was incredible. The host and waitresses would promptly come around frequently always making sure we were content. I would definitely return here and suggest anyone else do the same...just make sure you are feeling hungry!

Love this place! Great price and really cool store front. Blast from the past feel. Also the great thing about this place is that I've been here 3 times and each time the flavors available on the italian ice have been different so its never the same old thing and you can always look forward to being surprised on the current flavors. The service is always great and the place is very clean. Also another awesome thing about this place is that if for some reason you can not decide on what to get they will give you a taste to help you out with your decision. Oh yeah and they also have a rewards program! :)
