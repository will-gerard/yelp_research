I was here the other evening for a meeting (which by the way was set up in the middle of the main dining room, instead of off to one of the side aka quieter areas..making it near impossible to hear anything) and I did not have any of the food, so I will refrain from commenting on what I did see...eh.  I did; however, order a house margarita, and noticed on the menu that it came in two sizes.  I was not asked what size I wanted, just given the larger $2 more size... how clever.  I asked for it with no salt and it came with the most salt I have seen on a margarita EVER!  Ok, fine, whatever.. I wiped it off.. It came with two straws  (so you drink it faster. and order more..HA! I am on to your tricks... no thanks!)  As for the actual taste of the margarita....BLEH... blandest ever.. didn't even really taste like lime or sweet n sour, or the like.. it reminded me of these really gross margarita "pouches"  (think Capri Sun) that I bought once while in Cali on vacation... they were so gross that I ended up freezing the rest as ice packs for my cooler!  I am not sure if this margarita had much tequila in it either... so for my $8 I had a goblet of wasted calories....sad.  The service is another low point.. once our servers realized that only 4 of our party of 10 were eating (always a pisser, I speak from experience..but still people) they were pretty much imaginary for the rest of the night.. It took about 10 minutes after I was ready to leave for me to see one of the  servers, and he promptly told me that he couldn't get my check, but as soon as he saw the other server he would let her know.. 5 minutes later she made an appearance... sigh.  I have heard not really great things about this place, and based on my experience I doubt I would go back to give the food a try.

Went to this location today to meet friends because it was the closest to the middle of our houses.... thanks Good Egg for totally ignoring the SW Valley :/  I drove here not expecting much (always known this location as the crappy one), I had been to this location while it was still under the forgotten step-child The Eggery.  I was surprised that they had finally gotten rid of that name and changed the signage to The Good Egg (not sure if this is recent or not, I haven't been down this part of Camelback in a bit of time).  Upon seeing the new signage, I thought perhaps there would be a better experience to be had.... no, nope, not at all.  I met my party that was already seated in the WAAAAAAY outdated restaurant... I mean seriously people, the bakery cases that haven't been used in decades, the wood, the wallpaper, the metal chairs, and all the BRASS... oh my goodness all the brass....YUCK!..... Give this place a little attention Good Egg.  When I sat down I found half of the table wet and no napkins, a little puzzled I asked what the deal was.  Apparently the waiter had spilled the water all over the table and used our napkins to try and wipe it up.... I repeat TRY to clean it up, he didn't succeed. Perhaps if he had went to get a towel he could of gotten all the water up, but apparently he never did (as this happened 10 min. before I got there and there was still puddles all over the table.  Nor did he come back with fresh napkins...nice buddy, nice.  After being there for about 5 minutes the guy came to ask if I wanted anything to drink... Coffee and cream please. And walks away before we can say that we are ready to order... Now I am the ding dong who was a half hour late because my ass slept in, so friends were huunnngggry.....He comes back with coffee (lukewarm at best), no cream, and walks away...AGAIN.  We sit, and sit, and sit.  He finally comes and ask if we are ready to order, umm.. we had been there 45 minutes and 15 minutes...yeah, I think we've got it.   We order and remind him again of the cream and napkins.  He comes back with cream, no napkins.  sigh.  Food finally comes, order is right, but haphazardly prepared.  Maybe the kitchen guy overslept too?    I have the Monterrey, it is missing tomatoes and you can tell that it was almost forgotten about because the eggs were starting to brown, my english muffin is nearly burnt and looks like it was toasted on a grill that needs some scrubbing, the cook compensated by soaking it in butter. Dollar Pancakes were shaped like road kill, and the side plate they came on was placed on my main plate.  That's no big deal, I don't care.  But as I am going fork to plate the server takes the side plate off the main plate...umm...eew, don't touch my food once it has hit the table.  I worked my way through high school and college waiting tables, I have a high tolerance for eew, but some things just bug me right away... this is one of them.  Dude, if you touch my food while it is in the kitchen, ignorance is bliss, but if you do it in front of me once the food is ON THE TABLE for goodness sake then that shit just be NASTY yo!  I know damn well there is a good chance your hands aren't clean.  Practically no food workers wash their hands as much as they are supposed to unless the health inspector is there....sorry people, its true.  Friend 1 had an even more crispy looking omelet.  Friend 2 got a turkey sandwich.  It was dry, and lacking in well... turkey! It looked as if they had folded up one piece of lunch meat to make it look more substantial.  Her salad was pretty lame looking and had the runniest ranch dressing I had ever seen.  What was even worse is that there was one sad runaway strawberry in her sandwich... wtf? Check your cold storage bins people!  If Friend 1 had been the one to order the sandwich instead of Friend 2 then I wouldn't be writing this review right now because I would be supporting Friend 1 in the HOSPITAL!! Friend 1 has a major strawberry allergy.  i understand shit happens, but how does a STRAWBERRY get put on a TURKEY sandwich and the cook doesn't notice?!??!!!  We could of said something if our server wasn't practicing his disappearing act again. Only time we saw him after he dropped off the food was when he dropped the check, and kindly paused out of his busy day to say "Everything ok?" ...kind of waited for a response and walked away.. no "thank you" "have a good day" "come again" "bugger off" nothing....  Mind you I use the word "busy" lightly, there was about 6 tables in the whole place full at 10am, and at least 4 other servers that I saw.   This was the third time I had been to this location... shitty experience as always, you know what that means people.... three strikes you're out! (oh and the water pitcher that half of which was spilled all over...the water was unfiltered grossness...boo :/ )

Phoenix needs more great mom & pop's like this place!  Great food, a gazillion choices of sandwiches and the like (I suggest looking at their web page and narrowing down your choice before going in)  Reasonable prices, big portions, and a laid back atmosphere makes this place a winner!  It was an awesome place to grab a quick bite before hopping on the light rail to catch a game.

I am really torn about Karsh's.  I have been shopping here for 20 some odd years, and have definitely seen some ups and downs.    The service used to be fabulous, then it got crappy, and now its pretty good.  The same goes for the baked goods.  The quality of the product seems to go hand in hand with the quality of the staff.  However, their cake has remained consistently delicious.  The Black and Whites used to be pretty darn good, but now they are MUCH MUCH more cake like and dense than they used to be.  And the frosting has gotten progressively sweeter over the years.  The bear claws have now taken over as my new favorite.  The fruit bars are now hit and miss as to whether or not they are soft.  Chocolate horns are nice, as is most of the candy type confections.  Prices of course have gone up, but that is everywhere.  So how do I feel about Karsh's?  That's a good question, it appears that my love and bewilderment towards Karsh's changes with the wind.  So ask me each time and we'll see what the review says this week?!

Moderately cheap drinks. Pool tables and Shuffleboard (yea!!)  People keep saying the food is good... perhaps someday I will get drunk enough to try the food from this dive... I don't know if I would order food from here soberly.  But the beer is cold, the music is decent, the Christmas lights are on and the people are amusing to watch.  Ladies.. a tip to the wise.. put the Clorox wipes in your purse to give the bathroom a lil perking up before you use it and its far less scary... besides there is always something amusing written on the stalls, so it is easy to distract yourself from the grunge..  And if you are there at the right time, a crazy from the center down the street will come around asking for a smoke and passing out roses he ripped of the bushes next door.  Oooh Pomeroy's!

I'll be short, and just get to the point on this one:  The only reason I managed to give this place 2 stars was because they definitely gave you good sized portions for the price.  However, a large portion of nasty, is still just nasty, regardless of how much they give you.  The Chicken Fried Steak (their pride and joy) was bland and the only flavor was grease.  I don't mean the typical "its a fried dish" grease flavor, no i mean it tasted like after they pulled it out of the fryer they dipped it in the oil vat.  The gravy was nondescript and flavorless.    Side options were nothing special, they seem to rave about the cole slaw, but it is not my cup of tea, so I passed.  This place seems like the type of establishment that if you are a regular then you get stellar service, if you are not, then oh well to you.  Funny, because how do people get to be a new regular if you aren't giving decent service to the new guest.  To sum it up, people swear by this place. I however, have sworn off this place.  I don't get it, I left feeling ripped off and revolted that I even ate that junk (now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good chicken fried steak, this just was not it for sure!)

L O V E  Phx City.  This place is amazing!  Of the five million times I have been here, I have yet to actually go for Happy Hour, which I hear is equally amazing.  I love that this place is nice enough to warrant going to for a special occasion, but neighborhood enough that you will usually run into at least one person you know every time you come.  The Rose Lane Chicken makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Bread Pudding is divine, and they get mucho brownie points for not putting raisins in it!!  (I am super not into raisins)  They have a well rounded wine list, which was my go to, until the day I tried the Pomegranate Mango Collins.  Hellllooooo drink love!  Sweet and tart, but not too much of either, this drink is awesome!  Many awesome things on the menu, great daily specials, & you can really taste the love and local difference in all of their menu items.  The service is 97% awesome, very seldom do I get slow service there & it has never been slow enough to irritate me.  Definitely a go to place!

Ok... Let me lay it out straight first...  I can't justify spending the money on running shoes that I would spend to get shoes here... However, I will admit, having no clue what kind of shoes I needed I went in to gain some pointers.   Knowing full well that I was not going to purchase anything, the staff here..especially one particularly handsome gent..was more than willing to help me try on a variety of shoes to see what was best for my feet and activity style.  This was exceptionally impressive for me.  If I knew that I was going to commit to running long enough to spend the money at Runner's Den then I Definitely would be back to this neighborhood staple.  Their customer service and know how has won me over!

This place has been around for five million years.  I remember going here when I was a young kid with a friend of mine and her mom to get supplies to make an Italian feast.    I came in today to get some prosciutto to make a dish I saw on Giada... damn you food network and your impressionable ways!  The owners were there, the husband in the back making pizzas and the wife running the counter.  She was recovering from surgery and couldn't walk far, apologizing profusely that she could not walk to go cut my meat.  So we sat and talked while we waited for her husband (who was diligently watching those pizzas....they must be yumm-o!).  Sitting talking to the owner made me feel like I was in some neighborhood grocer in Italy and not in the middle of a Phoenix summer, which was a fun escape for the moment.    I hear their subs are tasty, and the pizza smelled delish! Perhaps I will come back again to give either a try.  The prices are not small, but the quality is good and the place is local.  It is definitely worth the visit, if nothing else to shoot the breeze with a cool lil old lady!

Love. Love. Love this place.  Good prices all day long, but stick around long enough and there will be some random even greater special price of the day.  Love that even on the special prices for cocktails you still get a fairly decent pour.  The patio is great at night for watching all the crazy drivers on Camelback.  Service is always pretty good, and the managers are always roaming about helping aid in good service.  They have pool tables and tons of TVs.  I've only had one thing here that I didn't like, and that was just a personal preference thing (their nachos are with the cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese) The 1/2 price munchie menu for late night is awesome.  I have a love affair with their Hummus....soooo good!!  Definitely a place to check out for sure!

Been ordering pizza from Stumpy's for some time now, and its pretty darn tasty.  I am super picky about pizza and my least favorite part of pizza is the sauce.. yeah, yeah, I know-weird... but anyways..  When I order pizza I always as for easy sauce and very few places actually give me easy sauce.  Stumpy's however, always listens.. which is greatly appreciated.  The pizza is always ready prompt and piping hot and fresh and they very frequently have coupons available which is an added bonus to their already reasonable prices!  Love this mom and pop!

I used to go to the 7th st location until it closed, while I find that to be a TOTAL bummer (bartender had a heavy hand & there were lots of the regular servers)  I do very much enjoy the salsa at this location better.  It is chunkier and fresher tasting.  I feel like the enchiladas are a bit smaller at this location and they don't use quite as much spice on their machaca, but regardelss the food here is good.  Yes, it is "Americanized" but 90% of the places in az are, its all good.. you just have to find the tasty "Americanized" mexican food places and Manuels happens to be one of them.  The hostess is always personable, which is great and makes a nice first impression.  Service is hit and miss, but the food is good and the price is right.

Been coming here for the past couple of years now.  The building is in desperate need of a makeover, but the staff is friendly, the food is consistent and the margaritas are lovely.  Our server Pedro is spot on, personable and on his toes.  The front staff is great too, Ola is welcoming as can be.  The fabulous staff here is what keeps us coming back, keep up the good work guys!  (oh, and do a little redecorating!)

Love this place!  The pedicures here are divine and last forever and the manicures are just as lovely.  They recently got a new model of massage pedicure chairs which are even more addictive to sit in.  I have been coming here for 6+ years and love it! Reasonably priced and clean, consistent atmosphere keep me coming back!

My family used Snappy for YEARS, we are talking decades before moving into a townhome and no longer needing service. They always showed up, did a good job and charged a fair price. Now being an adult with a family of my own and having recently fired my lawn service for doing too much damage, I was looking towards Snappy to come service my lawn. Their website does not have a map or something of the like to show what parts of town they service. I called to ask if they serviced my area and the lady on the phone (who was polite) went to look and see if we were in their area, put me on hold, came back and said she would have to look into it. She got my information and said she would call me back and let me know. Well that was 4 days ago. Guess they don't need the business, funny because I know they lost my family as a client recently due to a move... you would think they would want to replace the business. Guess not.  Oh well, the hunt for a new service continues.

Eh.  This is the second Fatburger I have been to, as I usually like to give mediocre a second try in case it was a fluke.  Nope, sorry Fatburger- you are just bland.  The burger was lacking excitement.  Bland was the theme of the day here.  The prices were way out of line for the end product.  Oh well.

I love that this Brewery actually brews their beer at EACH location, which is very uncommon for a chain brewery.  The beer here is pretty darn good, and their brewer has the awards to show for it.  This place is in the area, and I have been going there for quite sometime.  The menu has seen a couple of changes throughout the years, some menu items are hard to say goodbye to and some I am super excited to say hello to!  The Texas Fire Steak and the Ballpark Pretzels with Spicy Spinach Cheese Dip are tried and true standbys.  The Cod Fish & Chips and the Little Italy (with chicken) are pretty darn mouthwatering new additions.  And being a mexican food purist, I was pretty surprised to find their enchiladas uber tasty.  Their Happy Hour food menu has recently changed, and now for $5 you get FULL Sized appetizers (except the sampler platter) and the beer prices are ever awesome during happy hour. (both regular hh and latenight) Only in the bar and patio, but there is plenty of room to spread out as the patio has misters and is dog friendly and the bar has both tables and booths.  A handful of large flat screens and a couple old school tvs finish off the bar with a large picture window into the brewery (free entertainment if the brewer is brewing at the time, get to watch him at work!).  The dining room has an open kitchen on one side and a wall of windows on the other.  They even have a private banquet room as well, pondering having a function there myself.  My friend and I went to eat here one day with her kids, and kids were free on monday and tuesday, which was pretty cool.  This place has definitely seen some changes over the years, but they try hard and if all else fails grab another beer and some chocolate cheesecake and you can't go wrong!!!

I have been coming here for years for my waxing needs.  My first was actually when they were just in the single location by Hallmark (which is now their hair salon) and now go to their day spa location (by Einsteins).  The service here is efficient and friendly.  The individual service rooms line the halls by the nail area and are just the right size to feel private, but not too small as to feel cramped.  I have also had a spray tan here for a springtime wedding and was quite happy.  It is not computerized and with being sprayed by an actual person, you get a better more precise result.  It is a little pricey here, but it is a good location and they are really good about getting people in on short notice-so that is a plus!

It is true, unfortunately due to the awkward location this Claim Jumper was unable to keep its doors open.   Many of your favorite servers have been thankfully relocated to other locations.  Please support the next closest location of Claim Jumper in the Deer Valley 30 complex off of the 101 & I-17.

I've been here a couple if times an I think I leave less impressed every time.  The food tastes canned, frozen, or from a mix. The service is lackluster at best.    Today our food was cold and dry... How does that even happen when the food took less than 10 min to get to the table... To me that makes it seem like it was all precooked and reheated to order.  I suppose I am not their target clientele, regardless I still have left every time I've gone feeling like I wasted both calories and money.

Some places are just so a part of your childhood that they always remain a favorite.  La Pinata is one of those, I have been going here since before I was born... no seriously, my family has been regulars for decades.  Kids grow up and it had been quite sometime since I had been to La and went there for a birthday dinner recently.  Man oh man it was a blast from the past.. not much has changed.  There was a new pinata- Chicken Little.. made me smile & the Steak Piccado was off the menu.. but other than that is same ol' same ol' (including the non-pos terminals for servers.. which made me chuckle a bit).  And you know what it works.  That is what has kept people coming here forever.  Portions are huge, flavor is even bigger.  Support your local restaurants!!   (Btw.. for those of you who have been coming here for years, there is a new AZ history mini-book series available at Barnes & Noble and some Walgreens.. Well the one about Mexicans in Early Phoenix mentions a couple times throughout the book about Pete and his early days with the band.)

Pleasantly surprised.  Stopped in for lunch today and got their pizza by the slice.  Now usually when you go to a pizza place and get the pizza by the slice it is dry and has that "been sitting under a heat lamp for 4 hours" taste.  This pizza did not.  It was just the right temp, the pepperoni was perfectly crispy (a huge plus for me) and there was an awesome amount of cheese compared to sauce (not big on sauce in general, so I am always happy to find a place that doesn't drown the pie in sauce).  Grabbed some ranch for the crust.. The ranch was a great consistency and had nice season to it.  I'd go back.

Overall this place is a solid three stars; however, the patio definitely brings it up a notch.  This patio overlooks Mill ave and is a great place to get a free "show" during your meal.  While it is true in AZ that patio weather is only for a couple months out of the year, this is one of the patios during these months I will be sure to hit up.  Grab a bunch of friends, a couple of cocktails and sit back and enjoy the show.  On the day we were there we were witness to one of the most unorganized protest marches I have ever seen, and a whole variety of drunk people on random tangents.   The food here is pretty decent, moderately priced as well.  Our server was a little absent, but I think he was just over-extended.  The manager was very nice, if not a little too overly flirtatious. On this visit I had some Greek beer that was fabulous (hmmm.. that reminds me, I keep forgetting to look for it at Total)  and a pomegranate mojito.. a lil pricey for the size, but tasty nonetheless.   Overall, I'd recommend it.  Definitely for patio goodness, and moderately for the food.

I don't get it. I really, really don't.  People swear by this place.  I know people that have gone here for years, and for that reason I gave it my three strikes chance.  If a place has potential, or great reviews I will generally give it three tries to see if I had just missed something previously before I will take it out of my rotation of restaurants.  Well dear Via Delosantos, you're out!  This place is a hole in the wall, so you expect it to be a lil quirky,  but I always left feeling like it was more towards dark and dingy. The service was never anything to impress on my visits, on my last visit it took around 8 minutes for our server to show up in the first place and I was considering walking out all together.  The food here is mediocre.  Definitely nice sized portions, and there are a couple winners to choose from, but with a menu this large it is expected that there will also be some losers as well.  They pride themselves on their margaritas, and maybe I am just used to stronger pours elsewhere, but I found them to be pretty weak.  Basically, I find this place to be lackluster.  I am all about supporting the mom and pop, but there are plenty of other local Mexican restaurants to choose from, so all these people that swear by this place can keep it, I'll go elsewhere.

This place is a college student and mo-pro dream.  There are extension cords everywhere, allowing for many, many people to plug in their dying laptops all at once.  Plenty of table space to spread out all your paperwork and textbooks, the wi-fi is free and they are open late!!!    They have a piano and occasionally people will come in and just randomly play it.... its a nice break from all the working or studying.  Yes the chairs are plastic, its true.  Could they fork over a lil extra cash and buy more comfortable and cosmetically appealing chairs... definitely! But, its not a deal breaker for me.  The coffee is pretty decent, its one of the few brews that will actually keep me awake... sometimes to a fault.    They have a nice baked goods selection... the chocolate chip scone is divine!!  A whole cooler full of bottled juices and sodas of vast variety is available for the non coffee and tea lovers.  Not a big fan of gelato in general, so I won't comment on theirs.. but there are quite a few flavors to choose from.   Overall if you are looking for a sweet, romantic coffee shop to soul search in...this is not your place.  If you are looking to have a change of scenery from the typical work/study space or hang out with friends and play some board games then this is totally going to be a place to check out.   Oh.. and if you get that weird "gee I feel like there is something so familiar about this building" vibe while you are in there, it is because back in the day it was one of those sit-down Pizza Hut restaurants, haha!

It has taken me awhile to finally post this review (ummm... hi Yelp App people..... you've made a million updates to the app.... why not a post from app update?!?!)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  You know something that really creeps me out about a place?! ...sticky salt shakers...eeeeew! I mean seriously people... Anyways, I digress.  My friend and I were to be downtown after the R4TC this past Sunday and were looking for a place close enough to the race site to be convenient, yet far enough from it that there would not be a mad rush of other race participants.   We finished the race later than usual, so we arrived at the Cafe around 10:50.  When we entered to the front door, and there were already two other parties in line ahead of us, so we did the logical thing and got in line behind them.  The line was formed by one door, leaving the other door for people to go in and out of (this will be amusing later on in the review).  We stood at the front, there was no host stand nor a spot that was clearly where parties waited to be sat, so we did the lemming thing and stood where everyone else was. On three occasions people just stood outside staring at the blocked door and looked at the line waiting for the whole line to move instead of using the CLEAR door... ummm.. really people?! And of course on all three occasions they had the nerve to be all huffy at us. HA!  Five minutes go by and no one has come to talk to the mass forming at the door, a little miffed, I keep standing there as my friend goes up to the bar/cashier to ask if there is a wait list or something.  Finally, while she is over there a manager? Comes and asks everyone BUT me if we are on the list... ummm.... What I am under the age of 50 so I don't get attention?... just because I may not be your target clientele doesn't mean I am not a paying customer.    Another 10 minutes go by, and after everyone else is sat (including Mr. Huffy Pants that came in after us) we finally get a table.... In the corner, by the office.  Shortly after we are sat someone brings us some water.  And then we wait... and wait... and wait... 10 minutes later someone comes by to ask what we want to drink, we get our coffees and then our server disappears for awhile again.... Now just having done the race and not had anything besides a banana since 6am we were HUNGRY and tired of waiting!   About 45 minutes after we had entered, we finally got to place our orders.  We had to flag people down to get coffee refills 3 times because our server was a magician practicing her disappearing act all morning. Actually, I'm not sure why we kept drinking the coffee because it was old and burnt tasting, but hey caffeine is caffeine. We finally got our food.  sigh.  It was lukewarm, dry (in the case of a waffle), and overcooked.  We were too hungry, and too tired to say anything, but its ok because our server never came by to ask how things were or if we needed anything once we got our food.  Only saw her again when it was time to pay.    We do the R4TC every year, and are always looking for an awesome mom n pop to go to eat at afterwards.... gotta say... this one will definitely NOT make the list.

It had been ages since I'd been to Chen Wok (as I had previously called it bc I had no clue all these years that there was an "&")  and it was like I stepped into a time warp.  Nothing about the place had changed, and not in an "eew this place needs a remodel" kind of way, but in a "wow, this brings back some great memories" kind of way.  As the neighborhood staple for Chinese food, this place was getting busy, but my food still came out piping hot and delicious.  In fact it even made it all the way across town and was still hot & yummy.    Gotta love the Moo Shu Pork, although I really wish they gave you more than 3 crepes.  And the House Chicken is super yummy.  Their prices are super reasonable and they even have coupons on their web page.  With this I got a pint of Moo, Pint of House, (which came with a pint of white rice), and 8 crab puffs all for $11.89.  Dear Chen (&) Wok,  I'm sorry it took me so long to get back to you, I won't let it happen again!

I went here for 3 minutes a few years ago, in an attempt to try a place besides my local watering hole (you know variety is the spice of life) and was thoroughly unimpressed.  I wish I had given it a better chance...  I went here a second time, again for the same reasons and the weather was nice and the patio was right.  The patio was spacious and covered.. a plus!  This place was hoppin' on a friday night, always a good sign.  They were having a beer special because on of the distributors was there and so that was a bonus.  The bartender was nice, friendly and efficient.  He also made a good German Chocolate Cake.. the right way.. not the lazy bartender way.. which always makes me happy.  He even came out to see how I liked it, even though we were sitting out on the patio and seldom do you see a bartender leave this post.    On my previous visit I didn't stay long enough to see just how big this place was.  To the north the main bar area has a lot of seats and tvs, in the middle is the huge patio, and to the south is another room with a bunch of pool tables.   I didn't get anything to eat, so I can not comment on the food.   The ladies room was a little bizarre.  It looked like the tried to make it feminine  and clean, but really it was just oddly tiny and a lil grungy.. no big deal.  This savvy par patron knows that a nice ladies room isn't always a guarantee, so I carry hand sanitizer!  I'll be back, a new place to grab a drink with friends is always nice.  Haven't gone for happy hour, might try that and I also heard they have team trivia... definitely will have to try that!

Margaritas were ok, they had a different level of booze each time. The happy hour price for a house marg. was what I would normally pay for non-happy hour anywhere else. The location is pretty sketch. The service is pretty non-existent. Our server got to us pretty soon after we sat down, so I figured the other reviews had sparked some change in them, but I soon found out this was not the case. It took 10+ minutes to get drinks that were ordered. One drink too 20+ minutes. It took 30 minutes for our server to run our checks. .They were not busy at all, the place is HUGE and there were maybe 20 tables with at least 7 servers that I saw. The chip buffet was just weird, the salsa was nice and cold, but the chips tasted like vinegar. The only thing they gave you to put chips on was a small side plate, kind of difficult to put chips on.

Nice location.    Very bright, which is nice.   Pizza is good as always from Barros.   Their chairs make me chuckle... looks like they bought them from a Greek restaurant that went out of business... they have that awesome Greek Isles Blue color going on!  Bathrooms are average.  Clean and normal industrial bathroom soap smell, nothin' funky.

You get what you get and you don't throw a fit.... But you seriously, why are all Applebee's soooooooo bad?  You used to at least be able to count on them for a cheap happy hour booze & food wise. Not so much any more, there are barely any choices & it's mostly stuff people don't want to drink.  Service was impeccably slow, 45 minutes to get our entrees. Margarita tasted like the kind that comes in those Capri Sun like pouches.  Everything tastes as unfresh as it is. The only saving grace was the French fries were fresh, even if only one sad, lone fry came seasoned. On the upside they have great S&P shakers to fix that.

Absolutely baffled by the rude attitude and lack of product knowledge I experienced by a team member at this location. Won't see me back at this location, not worth the headache!

Seriously?!?!?  This place is revolting.    They have lots of items.  I say items because very few of them look like anything that resembles legitimate food.    Having gone here with some family friends one night, my boyfriend and I paid at the front. (umm.. $25 for a buffet-could go to an actual restaurant and pay a couple bucks more and get real food with a real server... but i digress) We paid and were told to wait in line to be seated (what is this Disneyland.. why am I waiting in line at a buffet?) We were sat in the "dining area" it was awkwardly close to the food area, so it was a little sketchy for me to put my purse anywhere besides between my feet.  The food, like I said earlier, there are a lot of item options.  90% of which are overcooked, under seasoned, or just plain unidentifiable.  Overall, we left feeling ripped off and still hungry.  What a waste of calories.  Now mind you, I must note that I am not against the buffet.  I have been to some over the years that have mastered the concept well.  Golden Corral, despite their creative yet obnoxious television ads-has not!

Not worth the effort.  The beer here is pretty bad. And they charge for tasters, so to try a beer to see how bad it is before committing to a full pint will cost you money.  It really irks me that they do not brew their beer at each location, yet have it shipped in... not very mirco brew of them.  I have been to a couple of their locations, including this one.. It took me 4 tries of this company before I realized I was never going to leave thrilled and to just give up on BJ's.  The service on average is slow and at times moody (with the customers that is, with other staff members they goof around and snap each others exposed thongs-that was a bad dining experience). The food is bland and boring.  On my final visit my boyfriend's entree came out to the table and mine was nowhere in site.  Five minutes later our server finally came by to tell me that my chicken had been burnt and it was the last one they had, he was oh so kinda as to ask me if I wanted to order something else.  WTF? Really?!? Are you serious with me kid, no I want to sit here and watch my boyfriend eat.. what kind of question was that?  So 20 minutes after my boyfriends meal came, I got my meal.. some pasta thing.. should have just ate my napkin, might have had more flavor.  The only MILD saving grace of BJ's is their pizza, its decent, not amazing, but decent.  But one decent pizza will not bring me back to this joke of a brewery.. and btw..what's with the garage doors on the wall?!

The Phoenix locations are hit and miss... mostly miss for service.  But the food is good. There are lots of choices, both tradtional bad for you breakfast, and healthy delicious options.  This is one of their newest locations, it still has that fresh and up-to-date feel, which is a plus.  Patio seems nice for the days when the weather is right, it is in a nice complex, parking is a little tight, but oh well.  The coffee here is amazing. The flavored coffee of the day has never let me down.

It wasn't horrible.      However, it wasn't good.  We walked in and the whole layout of the place was quite awkward; it felt like the dining room was in some hallway.  The service was ok, not good, but not entirely crappy either.  It was pretty scattered, but good enough.  The menu is like Old Chicago, but with 80% less flavor.  The HH beer prices were the only saving grace of the place..$3 for a 22 oz (sadly, domestic-but whaddaya gonna do, times are tight)  Now, I have a bit of a cold, so things are a little hard to taste right now.  I ordered the club on a croissant with curly fries (I am a curly fry freak), there was no flavor to either.  I figured it was just the cold speaking, my boyfriend noticed that I barely ate either one, and took a couple bites of mine; unfortunately, let me know that it was not the cold, but the fact that the food truly had no taste to it, that was the issue.   Oh well.  Yelp told me so, and if the choice of where to eat had been ours, we wouldn't have gone in.  But here it is, another crappy Yelp review page confirmed... NNY-you kinda suck.  $27 and the only thing I tasted was the Miller Lite.... and Domestics have no flavor to begin with..Oh My!

I would give this place one star; however, the decor was nice and the location is handy for a "dinner and a movie" night. (but not handy enough to warrant coming back.....)  The prices were alright, I would expect things to be a little cheaper based on a few things though: .The food was mediocre to bland .The ordering at the counter, yet having a "server" rushing around tables  like he was in some sort of relay race is just obnoxious. .No one welcomed us upon entering, after a couple minutes someone  asked if we were ready to order or if we needed to look at the board  longer  1/4 way through our experience here, we felt like we had already been ripped off.  The food really was nothing exciting at all.  The place itself appears to be in some sort of identity crisis. I mean is it counter service or sit down? You can't be both, it just annoys people.  Meh. My opinion...skip it and just fill up on popcorn or leave early for the movie and go some place else... perhaps with flavor and an identity.  Just a thought.

Walked in the door to the host listening to a server blatantly bitching about something, no acknowledgement, nothing, and another gentlemen with his back to the door who greeted me before the two girls staring right at me!  Our server was a little frazzled, but I am throwing that on tweedle dee at the front who clearly had triple sat her.  The place has a huge acoustics problem.. It was boisterously loud and echoey.  THe layout is really awkward, it is an oddly shaped place and that leads to tables being in odd spots.  We were in some sort of corner of a corner.  I was about to walk out as I was waiting for the hubster to find a parking spot (really tricky at this place on a weekend) and he found a spot quicker than our server greeted us (about 5 min).  But I felt bad leaving after he had spent so much time to find a place to park and we had wanted to try this place... We were actually trying it so see if it would be a good fit for a large (i.e 25 people) party we are planning in November (clearly we have decided against that)  I ordered a beer, I had asked what their draft selection was and she said that they had the Sam Adams seasonal (knowing Sam Adams usually has more than one seasonal at a time, this was as informative as telling me the beer was yellow).  I inquired more and the server said, "oh, I don't know, its like light you know, definitely lighter than Blue Moon"  I reply with, "light in what sense because Blue Moon is not a heavy beer in the slightest bit" ,( its actually an anti-beer..back in the serving days it is what I would suggest to people who want a beer that didn't usually drink beer). Her reply was "oh Blue Moon is REALLY strong! So this beer isn't like this!"  Oh jeez.  Really?!?!  Why I continued to ask for more clarification is beyond me, clearly this girl had never had actual beer in her life.. (having worked at a brewery for eight years, there is an inevitable beer snobbery that kicks in)  But, I have had some REALLY GROSS Sam Adams before (ie. their Winter beer with pine needles...yes, yes, pine needles...it tastes as air freshenery as it sounds)  Anyways, insert 3 more completely incorrect statements about beer later, and I just ordered the damn thing.  It was 118 out the weekend we went, and I just wanted something cold...all else fails I could just down it.  I was very thirsty by time it got to me...8 minutes later-with no head bc it sat at the well so long.  It was the oh so lovely host who brought it (which mind you, didn't look like she was old enough to serve the glass).  While waiting for my food (see below) I ordered a second beer...yeah, that one took so long to get to me it was warm...sigh.  About 30 min later the hubster's pizza came.  Mine, not so much.  Our server did not even acknowledge that my pizza was MIA.  I saw her frantically trying to get the managers attention.  I saw her impatiently talking to the expo. I saw her pacing.  Not once did she say, "hey it will be just a moment on the pizza".  Five minutes later she finally gets the manager to acknowledge she needs help.  Manager goes to the line, gets my pizza and delivers it.  Not once does the MANAGER say "sorry about the wait, etc".  I bring up the wait.  Her response...HA! "Oh well, our pizzas are hand made, so they can't possibly all come out at the same time. And your pizza has fresh sausage on it, so clearly it has to cook for longer.  I mean you should see how it is when we have large parties, they never get their food at the same time. It is just how we do things here. You should of expected that for a fresh made pizza"   WHAT THE HECK?!?!?!?!?! Did that just happen?!?  Oh and your FRESH sausage...it tastes just like the pepperoni on the hubsters pizza...tastes just like Jimmy Dean. Lady, don't patronize me. I worked in restaurants for 13 years, I watched the game happen the second our server realized she forgot to put my pizza in...Don't make up some lame excuse about pizzas can't possibly be ready at the same time for the same table...if that is actually true then you have a very POORLY run kitchen.  Our server was nice, but that didn't make up for the horrible service we got... Only part of it was on her end though.  I asked for a box, server said she would box it...ugh I hate that. What I ended up with was foil very loosely covering my pizza and thrown in a huge bag...umm...really?!?  You're a pizza joint and this is the best method you have for left overs?!  $50 for two pizzas, 2 beers, and a salad accompanied by obnoxious staff and overcooked pizzas....yeeeah no thanks!  Oh and they were rolling silverware outside on the patio... Sucks for the server that does it & I sure hope bugs don't land on the "clean silverware".

Would love to leave negative stars.  Wasn't my choice to come here, but after a day spent to my bridal shower my family and I just wanted to get a quick bite to eat without doing dishes. We headed down Bell road at 7 on a Saturday night and Applebees was the only place without a wait...should've been a red flag.  I try to not come to places like this for anything but happy hour because they are well... crappy... but my diabetic mother had already waited long enough and we just needed to get her food.  We waited at the host stand for about 5 minutes... should've just left.  A manager finally came to seat us, no apologies, no personality, just a patronizing shell of a person.  Was more interested in making sure he got his canned sales pitch out and to make very, very clear that we understood happy hour was not going on right now... oy!  Another five minutes go by and we finally get one asswipe of a server.  I could go on and on about his attitude and lack of service, but frankly the more I write the more I realize that we should've never come to this hell hole to begin with and it is our fault for wasting our money here.  Long story short, server was rude and pushy while he was there, then put in our food order and disappeared.  He was spending more time sitting with the table next to us on his phone.  Our food came out after tables that ordered after us. Our food was nasty and cold.  The manager didn't care about either, but told us not to tip the server if we weren't happy.  While I am usually one to give at least 10% for the worst service ever (heck, just "average" service gets you 20% from me), this guy was quite possibly the worst of the worst...and besides his manager endorsed not tipping the idiot, so we just left the change on this one and he came BURSTING OUT THE BACK DOOR AND CHASING US THROUGH THE PARKING LOT!  Oh and there was the same creeper smoking next to the entrance when we walked in and when we left.... a mere 10 feet from the door.  sigh.  $40 worth of frozen, improperly described (calling a button mushroom dish a portabello mushroom dish) nasty food, came out wrong and old tasting. Patronizing manager.  Jerky disappearing server who harassed us through the parking lot.  Yeah, our bad...shouldn't of even walked through the door.

It makes me sad how this is what passes for acceptable eating out these days for the majority of people... that rant being said...  We went here with my family celebrating 8 million occasions.  We all have very busy schedules and can't always make it to all of the events that happen in each others lives.  In the past 5 weeks my family has had 5 birthdays, mother's day, a graduation, and a retirement.  We finally picked a date that we could all meet up on, regardless of some of us missing the individual events.  And unfortunately, my in laws have some sad love affair with Darden Restaurants, so sadly we wound up at Olive Garden tonight.  We arrived with a party of 9 and were seated in less than 15 minutes, which is one of the few pluses of our OG experience tonight.  We ended up with 2 servers for our party, which is the company's sad policy.  That equals out to 4.5 people per server to wait on.... should be a piece of cake right?!  Four modifications were made to our party's order:    - 2 people asked for extra lemons in their ice tea                 -(one got no lemon, the other got 1 lemon)    - 1 person asked for sauce on the side    - 1 person asked for an item to be added to their pasta                 - (this resulted in an overly long thought process about                     whether or not the computer had a button for it)  No one ordered booze. Ice tea and water for the whole table.  Food came out moderately promptly and was accurate.  Drinks; however, were left not refilled for 4 party members for 15 minutes.  Salad plates were only cleared from half the table  Boxes were asked for, but left on a tray for us to retrieve ourselves.     Typical, but annoying is the response I have to this Olive Garden experience. But, why bother improving service when people keep coming anyways, right?!

There was a serious lack of personality, and polite customer service in our past visit.   The cashier didn't bother with a hello or good morning, just a what can I get for you.  Ok, fine, whatever, but we hadn't even looked at the menu yet.  When the bf and I were discussing with each other what we were thinking of ordering, eager beaver cashier girl took that as us talking to her and started trying to ring things in... mind you, we were a good 5 ft away from the counter, facing each other and using our "library voices".  Obnoxious!  They also had the lines laid out differently and forced you to walk through people sitting trying to eat at the high tops in order to get to your order and drinks. Very awkward.  My egg white sandwich was supposed to have tomatoes on in per the menu... it had 2 sad could of been a tomato at one point tomatoes on one side of the sandwich.   What I find to be interesting is... if you order a lunch sandwich you get a cookie. If you order a breakfast sandwich, you don't.... what the h man? Just because it is 9 am doesn't mean I am not jonesin' for a cookie!     The saving grace of this visit.... a random offensive, yet hilarious giant cookie on display which provided tons of laughs.

Finally checked this place out after "fan"-ing them on facebook months ago.    I must say I really like the feel in this location. The staff was really nice and attentive without being pushy or obnoxious.   It really seemed like the type of place where you could come in with your friends and pop out of the dressing room to get the whole store's opinion on your outfit.  It was fun and hip, but not pretentious. Feels like a place you would find in a smaller town, laid back, place where everyone knows your name, type place. I must say this is a huge perk in the middle of a big city.  I really enjoyed that they had a wide variety of sizes, making this a place all body shapes can feel comfortable.    They seem to be big on sales which is one of my favorite words, in fact on the day I came in my receipt had a coupon for their other location on the bottom of it... Hello Marketing GENIUS!  I'd be back for sure. High quality, brand names and amazing prices without the funky thrift store smell! Hello reasonably priced boutique store love!

I am rating this place one star...I am being generous, actually super generous...shame there is not a negative star rating system.  I went here one night with a group of family and friends, nothing extreme, just 6 of us.  The restaurant was about 1/4 full and they had live music.  Was not my choice to come here, we actually came on this evening bc my friend said that she heard the singer was good.    It took about 20 minutes before we were greated by our server and another 8 minutes to actually get our drinks.  Then our server flat out disappeared.  Finally remembering that she only makes money if she talks to the table, our server reappeared and took our food order.  35 minutes later our "food" came out.  We all took a minute to stare at our plates to figure out what exactly was on them.  I have had more identifiable food served to me in a school cafeteria.  The food tasted even worse than it looked and at this point (of course our server never came to see how things were) we were all pretty put out about the whole place.  Then the singing act (on break from her Motel 8 on the side of the freeway lounge act) came over to see how we liked the show and the food.  We told her exactly what we thought of the food and the service and the singer went BALLISTIC, I mean you would think that we just ran over her dog the way she reacted.  Completely irritated and annoyed we wanted out of this place.  Sadly it was another 15 minutes before our server reappeared and we asked her the very complicated request of getting our check.  Finally making our way to pay the cashier person asked how things were and we told her it was the most disappointing and aggravating experience we had ever had dining out...her reply "Everybody loves us, and we have amazing food, I don't know what you are talking about!" And scoffed off to go do something else.  Really lady? Really? Maybe you should check out the other reviews on here... seems like your fan club isn't as big as you thought.....  Just thinking about this place to write this review gets my pulse racing.  Never Never Again!

I am unsure as to why this place is supposed to be so great.  When they took over Waterworld they marketed it as if they completely redid everything, remodeling the whole place to make it totally awesome.  Well lets see, they added some slides. Put up some new signs, and put in hi-tech lockers.  That is about all I could see as far as remodel.    The boy and I used to frequent WW at least once a summer and once we saw the prices of its replacement decided it was not worth it.  However, this year we received free entry passes, so we figured why not.... Sadly we still fee ripped off.  $7 to park, surely they must of added coverage to the parking lot to justify the price right? I mean it is AZ.. in SUMMER, the only reason to pay to park is if it is covered... no such luck.  The "security" at the front checking bags and purses....yeah, I get it, they are 16 and getting paid minimum wage to stand in the sun all day... but the dude didn't even look down at the table to pretend like he was looking at my purse or bag.... should of brought a flask, would of made the day more fun!  The lockers were neat, no annoying key to lose...that was about the only upside of the whole place.  Mind you the girl at the locker rental told us about a million times that we MUST use the PINK lockers because that is what we had paid for... ok, cool..I like pink and the $7 "small" lockers were actually good sized.  She even wrote a big P on my wrist band... you know in case I forgot in the 5 ft walk to the lockers.... Well, funny thing is that after all of that the computerized lockers promptly told me that my band was only good for the ORANGE lockers... which you know made sense considering my wrist band was ORANGE.... sigh... maybe she missed the color day in Kindergarten.  We got to the wave pool..it was fine, nothing special.  Went to the lazy river.... YUCK!  I don't know when the last time it was cleaned was?!?!  I understand it is summer in AZ, we do get winds and they do blow leaves into the water... but Damn!  You could barely see the water for all the debris, there was a bandaid stuck to one of the walls.  And it looked like the river surface had not been resurfaced in at least 15 years, definitely not when the "remodel" took place when WnW took over!  The lines for all of the slides were at least 100 people deep and not really moving too fast, so we skipped them...wasn't worth it.  We knew that food and drink would be way overpriced and mediocre at best, so we ate before we got there... Good thing too, these prices were in fair competition with Disneyland food prices, and everyone knows what a rip off that is!  Overall: The only thing remotely cool about the place was the electronic lockers.  The staff was all on their teenage first job power trips, it was far too crowded to have much fun, it wasn't that clean, and all prices were far overpriced for what you are getting.    I am not shocked by the shitty reviews the place has, just shocked that they aren't doing something to change...For goodness sake Salt River Tubing has better reviews than this place, and people poo and puke in that river!

This area is severely lacking in sit down restaurant choices, so this was nice to see a sit down place going into the old Nicks 24/7, especially because it seems to have taken them 1200 years to get this place open...I had actually thought they had pulled out it took so long.  The menu here is large.  The pizzas are yum.  The pastas are nice.  They have this italian sandwich which is absolutely divine!  I just wish the sandwiches had more side choices.  You get a bland pasta salad at lunch or fried zucchini chips at dinner which are nice when fresh, but if left too long before hitting the table they are cold and floppy.  I have found the salads to be hit and miss.  Their tiramisu is totally delish!  And anyone that knows me knows, that if the tiramisu doesn't impress I am hard pressed to come back.  The service here sways between attentive or absent, guess its just the luck of the draw.  The prices are right, and if you sign up for their monthly newsletter you get some pretty nice bargains.

First time here, and after so many rave reviews we decided it was definitely worth a go...  Having heard so  much about the pretzels, they were definitely first on the list of things to try.  1/2 off for happy hour, I was pretty glad.  We got the garlic and parm type.  The boyfriend claimed delicious, I went with "eh". Mostly parm and very little garlic, they weren't my fave, but I think next time we will try the salt with mustard sauce and they might be more of a crowd pleaser.  Really wish I could do an "and a half" star rating here (come on Yelp..you know we all want that ability, lol) because the ability to get a pizza split in half so you don't have to choose just one of their signature pies was definitely a plus and would warrant an extra half star point.  We got the small pizza and asked our server which she preferred between the two we had narrowed it down to, she told us what she thought, but followed it up with "if you like we can just make it a half & half?" YES!  Awesome, perfect for the indecisive, and very hard to find, as most places with more complex pizzas do not allow this.  We ended up getting a half Potato Pie and half Caesar pizza.  The boy loved the Potato, said it reminded him a bit of his favorite potatoes au gratin. And I was a fan of the Caesar.  It was a nice blend between ooey gooey hot pizza and cool crisp salad, and I'm into flavor and texture contrasts in my meals.  The crust was a lil difficult to cut with a knife, and these were definitely more of the "fork n knife" type pizzas, but I can't tell for sure if it was the crust itself or just a crappy knife?!  We ordered dessert, Key Lime Pie was nice, just the right size... and I definitely think they used Ready Whip... Don't get me wrong.. this is a good thing.. love that shit..reminds me of being a lil kid.  They have a nice variety of beer and Happy Hour puts 98% if them half off.  The service was pretty good.  Pleasant and helpful, but not too pushy.  And considering we went for early happy hour and sat in the dining room (we were the only table our server had at the time) she still paid just the right amount of attention to us, which is great because frequently in other places under those circumstances one will get forgotten about half the time.  Overall a nice place, dig the decor, super bright.  Food was good, haven't quite decided if it was crave-able yet though.  Will for sure give the place another go and see if I leave wanting more.

This location started out great, but has gone hill a lot in the past year. The past 3 times out order was made wrong, and it took 3 times as long to fix it as it did to bring it out in the first place. Walls are dirty, holes or teared wallpaper on some. Staff ranges from frazzled to aloof to couldn't care less. Today our burgers were brought out (wrong) and was told our fries would be right up. 8 minutes later our fries showed up, still missing out shake. Caramel shake came out with crusty chocolate on the glass. Place had flies and Mosquitos coming in every time the door opened. Burgers had no flavor, only half my bun had sauce. I don't mean like only the top or bottom had sauce, no I mean literally only HALF of the top bun had sauce on it. So I cut my burger in half and only one half was moderately tasty (didn't know they didn't know how to use a spatula until I ate the ok side). Smash fries were pure oil & burnt herbs.  Seriously SmashBurger, you aren't the only quick place in the lot any more, step up or step out. You sell burgers & fries, how can you mess up so much, so often!??!

The nicest Barros location I have been to yet.  My boyfriend claims that the new building, ample air conditioning, and "nicer" decor takes away from the "true appeal" of a pizza joint.  But I however, appreciate all the nice clean newness of this location.  The booths are still comfortable and crack free.  Rich woods and large flat screen tvs are seen around the dining room.  Actual chairs from this decade at the tables add a nice feel as well.  The ladies room was clean and smell free.  And as always the pizza was totally delicious.     Oh Barros, why do I love you so?

This place is consistent and I like it.  The young chick who took our order last time was here again, and there was that glimpse of "hey, I remember you guys" in her service, as she seemed to have our order in the computer before we finished our sentences.  She was efficient and amused by our random banter.  Definitely winner of all the Barro's I've been to so far.

I like it here.  The pizza is pretty good, the wings are awesome!  Lots of good deals to be had here and the service has always been speedy and courteous.  Very easy to feed a large group for not a lot of cash. I agree with the below comment.. very clean place, even the ladies room is nice and clean (hard to come by)  which is very much appreciated.

Went in because I wanted a couple tortillas to go with dinner, figured a Mexican hole in the wall restaurant would be a good place for tasty tortillas..... WRONG!  Took 5 min before anyone acknowledged I was there, I should of just left.  The staff looked totally disorganized. I asked for two tortillas to-go. She looked at me like I asked for her to knit me a sweater with dental floss, she had to ask 3 people if she could sell tortillas. 10 minutes and  $3 poorer, I was the not so proud owner of two of the nastiest tortillas I have ever had! They were gummy & hard at the same time, how is that even possible?!? They had a disgusting aftertaste, didn't even want to throw them out to the birds. Gross!

Below is a general review of the two AZ locations I have been to, and at the bottom will be notes specific to this location...  This place definitely is not for everyone.  If you like Mickey-D's or In n Out then you probably should just keep on walking.  But if you like a burger that was made when you order it or fries that are real potatoes and don't taste like the cup they came in then this place could be a great option.  They are a little pricier than your average quick service joint, but its worth it.  The portions are HUGE, even if you order the "regular" fries and the "little" burger they are still BIG.  They don't charge per topping beyond the norm like Smashburger, and they have tons of toppings to choose from.  Would love to see a fried egg option, but other than that the majority of burger loving taste buds will find topping options that please them.  They have some non-burger choices as well, which is nice.  Hot dogs, grilled cheese (which people keep saying is a must try) and a veggie sandwich.  Eating here is a 5 napkin type experience, a lil messy, a lil crazy, but oh so yummy!  Hint: if you are transporting 5 guys in your car, definitely put something between the bag and your (clothes, passenger seat, floor mat, etc..)  the grease WILL leak through the bag.   I agree with a below post that the placement of peanut snacking boxes are a little awkward  (and frankly I don't get why they exist at all, but whatever)  BELL ROAD Location Specific:  Easier to get to if you enter on the Bell road side.  Staff seems to be more personable than the Mill ave location (at least on the day I visited)  Parking is vast and free.

I have not had any hair services here, however there is an awesome lady here who does nails.  I found Gaylee via one of the daily deal type sites and booked her for Shellac.  Having recently over the past year become obessed with Shellac  (My job is rough on my hands and I gave up getting a traditional manicure or painting my own nails because they would not withstand the abuse...and then I found Shellac and my love affair began) I am always looking for a good deal on it.    I have gone to a couple of places (my usual discount place where normal manis are just fine..to find that their Shellac training isn't super...to other salons...to find that they mix Shellac with other off brands and then you have to go back twice to get them fixed in one week...don't get me started).  And then I found Gaylee.....  I don't know what she does different, maybe it is because she listens to me when I say my hands go through the ringer at work and puts two top coats on... I don't know...  But I have never had better Shellac manicures than I have had with her!  Now every time I see a deal of her's online (I am on a strict budget here people...sorry...I would rather spend more money on the tip than the product) I grab it...  Centrally located at Shampoo Ink, she is easy to get to when I am out and about running errands... She is flexible in her scheduling and witty in her chatting (last time I was in we actually looked up a new eatery down the street on Yelp mid manicure).  I would recommend her to anyone...     *Side note...parking is a b*tch at Shampoo Ink, but it is worth the minor annoyance to get the best Shellac manicure in town....    (I will also re-post this under her name as well considering that is how it shows up on the deal sites...for fellow deal hunters)

The owner saw my review, and took the time to contact me.  I must say two things about this....   1. I honestly think that if more businesses took the time to check out their Yelp pages, then less businesses would have poor reviews.   and   2. If more businesses chose to do something to improve the perception of their business that the reviewer has in the case of poor reviews then more businesses would be flourishing.  That being said, I must praise Los Taquitos for doing both.  I have not had a chance to come in to eat again at the 16th st. location, but will make a point to do so in the near future....so look for another update.  But, if the personality and customer service that I received from the owner I spoke with (Rosie) shines through to the rest of her staff on my next visit, then I have no doubt my update will be a rave review!   Stay tuned........

I have been following my stylist around for 15+ years and this is where she currently resides....  This salon was opened and is run by stylists.  It is in the same complex as Honey Baked Ham and Hobby Lobby.  It is a decent size salon and offers the hometown, shop around the corner where all the ladies go, hair salon feel that is often lacking in a lot of the frilly "hip" salons covering the Valley.  Don't get me wrong though, this place is clean, well appointed, and modern; definitely a great place to meet your beauty needs!  Here is hoping for great success & Happiness amongst clients new and old!!

I contacted Leo less than a week before I needed to book a car service.    ...I had called a few before, only to find the person on the other side of the phone rude, the rates to be insane, or the reviews to be horrendous...    Immediately upon calling Leo, I knew I had found my man.  He was was courteous and prompt (had to call me back bc he was driving... hello good sign!)  When he came to pick me and my husband up at our wedding on Sunday  he arrived ahead of schedule, and had no problem waiting until we were ready to leave.  He was pleasant, and safe.  The car was clean and well kept.  Most definitely would use again and recommend Leo to others!!!  Thank you Leo!

I am so excited, I do believe I have found my new nail salon! I went in yesterday (day before Thanksgiving) and while it was busy, I was able to get in pretty quick and the customer service was great!!!  It was obvious there were quite a few regulars there and there were group conversations going around the room, like a small town salon where everyone is friendly with each other.    Had a great gal do my nails, wish I had gotten her name, she had a cute Mickey Mouse mask.  She was friendly and talented, did a great job on the designs for my toes and fingers. The leg massage had great pressure which is a huge plus for me!   I watched her and others taking tools in and out of the sanitizing machines and turning them back on after doing so, their sani solution was the right shade too, you need to look for dark color.   I'll definitely be back!!

Cute place and tea was decent. Shocked on the $3 cup of ice tea (16oz?) (no refills, at least I wasn't told as such when I paid) and not as many options as I would of expected for a place with tea in the name. Only two chairs, place is uber tiny. Girl at the counter was pleasant, but not really hospitable... Seemed surprised to have customers. Luckily there is patio seating, don't know if it is theirs or the mall's, but it was nice enough out that it worked.  I guess I expected more of a coffee house vibe, might go back if I was really jonesin' for a flavored ice tea, but most likely not going to deal with parking in the complex to make a special trip to CT&M.  I do wish them the best though, think they're mom n pop and I always hope they do well.

Shhhhh...... Do not tell my asthetician and I went somewhere else....and LIKED it!  Not being able to go to my usual girl, and needing to get waxed asap, I ventured to Yelp for help....hehe that rhymed. The reviews here seemed pretty good, and I liked that it wasn't a chain, so I figured why not give them a go.  The place is clean and bright, very, very orangey smelling... like sitting inside of an orange actually, but luckily the overwhelming citrus is just in the lobby. The receptionist was polite and efficient.  I am horrible with names, I should of grabbed a card.  My asthetician was fabulous, young girl, fun curly hair.  Wish I could remember her name though. hmmph. Anyways, she was very personable and not in the "I am supposed to chat with you" kind of way. Conversation was easy, which is always a plus when someone is pooring hot wax on your hoo ha.   This was my first time with hard wax for a Brazilian, and I must say I am a convert! OMG, it was fabulous!  My girl knew what she was doing too, I was so used to the same methods for so many years, and hers were nothing like what I am used to.... for the better.  She was quick, there was no need to move or manipulate myself or all my delicate parts, yet I got home to find that there was barely a stray hair left! Her skill paired with the hard wax got more hair, more efficiently than I am used to.  There were just a couple hard to get at hairs that I plucked when I got home. Two minutes max.   I did not leave the studio sticky either, so often with soft wax you leave feeling a bit of residue, not today. I was able to go about the rest of my day not feeling sticky, nor did I leave feeling like my lady parts had taken a beating. It was amazing!  Also, went in for an underarm, that was super quick and a very productive use of time.  I have dark hair with super strong roots, so I am used to having a couple hairs left over in the crease of my underarm.... nope, baby smooth.  Again, amazing!   Only things I felt a little eh about my experience:  Waaaaay too much orange smell in the lobby, wish there was an XL choice of panties for those curvy hips, (but its a cute free perk, so I can't really be too bummed), and they sent a text reminder for my appointment without approval of text alerts first, their answering machine is a real answering machine, so if the front is left unmanned and someone leaves a message, all the guests in the lobby can hear the whole message.  So really, petty things... The things that really mattered, friendly staff, good results, cleanliness. and reasonable prices are all spot on!  I'll come back.... just don't tell my usual girl, its our secret.....

Checked out Timo for the first time today for lunch. I must say I was was pleasantly surprised!  You can almost miss the parking lot if you don't look close enough (dork alert!), it shares the lot with what I looks like an office building? But there was SHADE to park in, if you parked near their patio!!   Speaking of patio, it looks like an awesome place to check out when the weather is less disgusting.  Unfortunately AZ being AZ in August, it is FAR from patio weather! However, I can imagine it to be a great place for a girls night or a date when the weather is more accommodating!  Having never been here before I was salivating by the descriptions on the menu, and had trouble deciding.  The wine list was awesome, it had some options on it I was unfamiliar with, and had quite the amusing time trying to pronounce, but the bartender (Adrian, I believe is what he said his name was?) was quite helpful & answered all my questions.  He even was kind as to give me a couple pointers as to what wines I might like based on what I said I usually drank.  The atmosphere inside was great, very quaint and chic at the same time.  Definitely a good place to gather with friends or enjoy a glass of wine to unwind at the end of the day. Very bright and airy, and they had these awesome glass garage doors that allowed for good people watching.  This part of town does not have many options when it comes to fun, chill, and chic places, so I hope this place sticks around.  And if my experience today with a great menu and awesome bartender is any indication of how it usually is there, I will definitely look forward to coming back and bringing friends as well!  Thanks Timo for becoming my new place to like and a great experience on a random Monday afternoon off!

****I have also posted this under Shampoo Ink's Yelp page because that is the salon she works at, but for the sake of fellow deal hunters she puts her deals under "Nails by Gaylee"****   I found Gaylee via one of the daily deal type sites and booked her for Shellac.  Having recently over the past year become obessed with Shellac  (My job is rough on my hands and I gave up getting a traditional manicure or painting my own nails because they would not withstand the abuse...and then I found Shellac and my love affair began) I am always looking for a good deal on it.

Went in here for my Christmas Eve pampering.... always the best way to celebrate the end of the hectic season before celebrating with family.    I called earlier in the day to ask about an offer I had received in the mail, I wanted to upgrade to Shellac and they were knowledgeable and prompt.  When I came in later in the day, they were able to get me in right away.  The salon is spacious and clean.    The pedicure was lovely.  I had the hot stone, which included a nice long leg massage followed by a leg massage with the hot stones.  The whole time (and into my manicure) they had a hot herbal wrap on my shoulders.  The manicure was great, and Theresa was very personable and kind.  On my last session under the UV of the process, she took of the heat wrap and gave a nice shoulder massage.  Once cured I received an equally as nice and long hand and arm massage.  The ladies here are very polite and welcoming.  The prices are also fair for what you receive.  I grabbed a business card on my way out, and when I looked at it later I realized that it was the punch card I had heard about prior to coming.  I wish I would of looked at it sooner because I did not get my punch for my visit due to the fact I didn't see the back while there.  I wish this newly opened salon the best of luck, if they keep up what I saw on my visit, I am sure they will do just nicely!!

They are one of the few legit places in the area to get a facial, so I really wish I loved it more.    I came here a couple of months back (So I am really hoping it has changed) and got a facial.    I got the first time client price, which seemed like a good price when I signed up for it... but after receiving the facial I felt ripped off.... I've had more thorough facials at beauty schools.    The girl who did my facial was very pleasant, just a little absent minded, and maybe new to the industry? She left the room twice after my facial was supposed to start because she forgot things.. hey it happens...  But what really irked me about the whole things is that there was no hand/arm/shoulder/scalp/leg nothing massage while the mask was doing its thing. Not every place you get a facial does ALL of those massages while the mask is on, but it is pretty much standard and expected to get a scalp massage and an arm/hand massage during this time.  Instead the girl took the time to clean up the room while I was laying there.  I appreciate cleanliness, but not when it is achieved by loudly cleaning the room while I am trying to relax.    Speaking of trying to relax...The girl would not stop talking!!! And I don't mean she was explaining what she was applying or the benefits it should have, no I mean she was just chit chatting.  She was trying to talk to me like we were best friends. I kept giving her short answers hoping she would get the hint, but she didn't.  At one point she said "Oh I forget you are here to relax, I'll be quiet now".....3 minutes pass and she is back at it... I suppose I should of spoken up and said something, but didn't want to hurt her feelings... sigh.  The facial was quick, too quick actually, it didn't quit fill the hour long slot that was promised. Especially when 10 minutes was spent going back out in the hall to get things she forgot.  She did the usual product recommendation afterwards, but wasn't too pushy.  I got a couple of samples, which was cool.   The front desk staff was also very friendly, and the decor was nice, especially for being in a strip mall.  I can honestly say though that I will not be back unless I see some more reviews on their facials because their full price would leave me cringing in pain if I received the same facial I did at the intro price.

I recently came into this location after another one of their locations was out of the product I wanted.  The two female team members I spoke with were both awesome.  They provided me awesome customer service with out "pouncing" on me the second I entered the door.  They welcomed me and allowed me to do my shopping without making me feel suffocated (like I had at the location that was out of my desired product).  These two ladies were personable, polite and knowledgeable.  I would definitely go to this location over the other again when in the area.

Went here today for the first time. Having moved clear to the other side of town has left me in need of a new nail salon.  (my good ol' standby is too far, and my shellac girl has gone missing)  The place was very clean, the staff was friendly, and the decor wasn't obnoxious or cheesy.  Two large tv screens were in the back and the radio was playing at a pleasant level throughout.    The classic pedicure came with ample massage time (really the real reason to get a pedicure, I mean really).  The chair water basin was covered with a disposable liner, that's clever... never seen that one before.  The classic at $22 came with the regular pedicure steps and a hot towel and stone massage as well.  The gel mani was efficient and well done, hope it lasts just as long as I am used to. The mani was followed up my hand and shoulder massage.    They have a VIP card option and at the time there was a coupon on Valpak (print and online).  Based on today's experience I am a fan, prices were right, services good, and staff friendly.  If the length of polish matches the impression so far, I will definitely be back.

New owners, feeling less than stellar about changes I am seeing.  They now charge to use a card. Get with the times, no one does that anymore.  I am sitting here writing this in pain from my pedicure bc the guy (new) tore a chunk out of my toe. He was rough, had to get the anti-bac out three times because he kept cutting me. Never once apologized. He was so rough, I figured for sure I was in for a great intense leg massage.  No dice. Weakest massage EVER! I felt like it was the guy's first time doing a pedicure. My nails are not smooth, one of my toes doesn't have polish on the side.  My gel mani was not done with a timer on the light, we'll see how long it lasts.  Poor girl was super sweet, but she was also new & I think this night of been one of her first gels.   Too many changes, none of them positive.  I dread finding a new nail place, but dear god my toe hurts, I don't know who wants to cry more... My toe or my bank account for paying for this pain!

We don't usually frequent the area, especially at night, but a meeting brought us in the area...  We searched Yelp for quite sometime trying to figure out what we wanted for dinner.... We landed here...  It was a great find.  While I don't usually find myself comfortable mingling with the Scottsdale crowd... makes me feel old... the crowd here wasn't too "typical".  The staff here was uber friendly and fun.  The decor was eclectic and amusing. They pour a mean drink and the Four Peaks Peach was the coldest I've ever had it poured. The menu was quirky and there were quite a few great choices on it.  The burger was delicious, the brownie was awesome.... definitely blow on it first... that peanut butter cup was a scorcher on my tongue.   Definitely a fun place to be and plenty of free covered parking next door is a plus!

Parking is a bit of a challenge, it is on mill ave so it is meter parking and limited meter parking.  Mostly parallel, but next to American Apparel there are some standard metered spots as well.  Regardless, make sure you have change if you will be parking to go to grab your burger!

My back took a beating after a recent vacation... maybe someday I will learn to pack lighter.... probably not.  Anyways, I came in here knowing that I just needed a little adjusting and the price was waaaaay cheaper than my copay for a chiropractic visit at my family doctor's practice.  I was seen quickly and efficiently. They don't do the amaaaazing muscle stimulator that my regular chiro does, which always sends me into a fantastic nap, but by not doing so is also how they keep the price low, so I don't mind. Both the doctor and the front desk clerk were pleasant and helpful.  There was an issue with the computer crashing and it turns out that it charged my card twice, but I came in when I noticed it and the second charge was refunded promptly on the next business day.  The guy at the front was very apologetic... not his fault, computers...can't live with them..can't live without them.  I will definitely back next year after my vacation again, even paying the single visit for a non-member, non-first time guest is way cheaper than my chiro co-pay, so it is worth it for me!  (I hope I don't get to the point where I really need the benefit of their membership, but if I do, it is a phenomenal deal!)

Totally excited to have something cute like this in the chain ridden South West Valley.   They have a great location by the Harkins and gives a sweet tooth fix for after popcorn or just a quick pick me up.  The owner and her staff are pretty creative and come up with some cute every day inventory and fun custom orders.  They have a fabulous social media presence which is so crucial for a local business.  They interact with fans, hold occasional contests, and offer the latest 411 on the shop.  I wish them the best, keep up the good work!

Been here a few times now, there are some flavors that were a bummer, but others that were so surprisingly good I guess it balanced out.. what was crazy was....  ummm.. something weird happened.... I liked a vanilla cupcake?!?!  Anyone that knows me knows that I don't do plain desserts.... vanilla ice cream..better put ruffles on it... plain candy bar...what no raspberry filling?....  I digress... The hubster and I splurged on some midis, and ended up with one vanilla... I begrudgingly ate it... and it was bizarre... it was...good?!? I liked a vanilla cupcake?!   Thanks Pixy... this new addiction won't be good for the diet.

I have now been to Pita Kitchen twice this week, I suppose that in itself says something.  Checked out this place for the first time when I went with a friend of mine on Tuesday, we went less than an hour before closing and still received very prompt and exceptionally courteous service....very awesome.    Said friend and I both got the Gyro pita, generous portion and very fresh pita, it was definitely tasty.  The meat was tender.  Also inside the pita is tomatoes, onions, and taziki.  The onions could be a bit thinner in cut as it was mostly thick slices.  And the taziki which they are VERY generous with, is a little thinner than I am used to.   Went again today with my mom, she loves Spanakopita, so was excited to find it on the menu.  It is listed as an appetizer, so I figured it to be small, and it was, but for the price of less than $3 it was still a good deal.  Again, I had the gyro and it was right on with Tuesdays visit.  *Note to self: order gyro with taziki on side next time, they are SUPER generous with it!  I don't know how the rest of the sides are, but they are generous with the fry portion, making the combo a very filling meal.  The regular fries are fine, pretty typical shoestring.  The greek fries are not as addictive as they are at My Big Fat with their lemon sauce.  However, they are still tasty.  They come with extra seasoning, some oregano and feta crumbles.  Sprinkle a little lemon on it and they are lovely.  What truly stands out at this place is the service.  These people are genuinely gracious and appreciative to the customers coming in their restaurant.  I don't know if it is just the first week excitement, or if this is how it will always be, but the welcoming demeanor of this place I have seen so far, on top of good food at good prices will definitely keep me coming back.  Welcome to the area Pita Kitchen, and thank you for bringing something new to this neighborhood in desperate need of variety and choices!

Super surprised!  Having never been a big fan of the Johnny Rockets chain, I was not holding out a lot of hope for this spin off.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  The burger, upon first glance gave me the impression that my skepticism on this place would be dead on... however, this is a great example about how looks can be deceiving.  The burger was thin, looked dry, and had copious amounts of lettuce... usually not a good sign.  Then I took a bite.... The burger was moist, and pretty darn flavorful!  I was quite shocked.  The fries were tasty, and the shake (although not as good as some other places) was pretty tasty as well.  We shared a burger, fries, and a Oreo shake for less than $10.  The concept is simple, the prices are good to average and the staff was nice. They are in the first weeks of opening, with a grand opening still to come, so I hope the customer service levels stay high after they have gotten comfortable. And I hope the burger is still as tasty as it was today.  I would be back, I would definitely go here before I would go to its big brother Johnny Rockets.   It is by the movie theatre, the prices were right, staff was friendly and helpful and it was fast without being fast food.

Well that didn't last long.... Less than a year and the prices are already going up.  Never really busy when I am here, at most there have been 3 other patrons during my visit... So maybe they are trying to compensate for the overhead and lack of business by raising prices, but that's not going to work people.  Look at all the other  places around you, your competition's pretty high. Four other burger places at this intersection alone. My order has gone up nearly $3 since my first visit.... Dangerous, especially in this neighborhood!  While I am thrilled to have added options in this area, if they're gonna play this game it's not worth it..  Burgers used to be juicy and flavorful, now they are just the thin dryness I expected before my first visit (see first review).  The fries are decent still if you can get them hot or fresh.  Today's visit they were downright chewy. A pigeon would probably turn the other way! When I asked for new ones the manager didn't seem surprised, guess he thought I might just keep quiet.  When I brought it up his response was "oh, do you want fresh ones made?" Sigh. No, I'd like more chewy ones left over from the lunch rush that have been under the heat lamp for an hour please!  As I am writing this they have customers sitting at the outside table between their two entrance doors smoking and throwing their butts on the ground.  Rude, distasteful, gross, and ILLEGAL... But the staff is too busy in their conversation to do anything, what about the manager you say? Oh well he is too busy "Scaring the 'crap' out of" the cashier to care...yes, crap was just yelled across this "family" restaurant.  Oh JRs, I know you're the lonely stepchild of Johnny Rockets, so I was skeptical to love you at all... Turns out if I just have it enough time I would be right... My love for you was shorter than a Hollywood marriage.

Seriously, as we were leaving we had at least 5 employees say "Thank you, have a good night" it was baffling... it was refreshing...it was lovely.  Great job Legends, it was our first time, but due to the friendly staff it will not be our last!  The place was packed, it was a game night.  The food was tasty for the type of place. There was definitely plenty of things to choose from on the menu.  Reasonably priced, good beer prices. Server was a bit slow, but I think we were out of her section, or her section was too large... I saw her at A LOT of tables.... So I can look the other way.

Would of given them 5 stars because the products are delicious, but there are two huge issues I had with my visit.  1. There was a line 7 people deep and one poor girl working by herself while there was some other employee in uniform going in and out of the store on his cell phone.  I don't care if you are off the clock, if you are off the clock you still should not be using your phone in front of a line of customers waiting.  And if you were just a kind human being all together and you were just on break and saw that your team mate was struggling, it would of been polite to help her out... just saying.  2.  And this is just REALLY OBNOXIOUS..... I made a purchase here the last week in JUNE and they just now batched their cc/debit purchases.... yup.... that's right.... 29 days later they finally deducted the money from my bank account.  WTF? What kind of company does their batching once a month?!?  While it was just obnoxious for me, it could of been a real issue for some people.... taking the money from the account a month later could really mess with some people's finances and budgets.....  Get with the program Krispy Kreme on Bell..... run YOUR finances better!!  Maybe this is why they keep going out of business in AZ.......

Absolutely horrid on every level.   Having never been here before, I checked out the menu online before coming in. The flavor choices looked plentiful and varied, they advertised one of the cool new coke machines, and the fries looked delicious. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.  I got there and it was in the middle of what is considered to be "lunch rush" time, and it was a day that many people have off or take off (Good Friday), and there were only 2 other people there.  This should of been a red flag.  I step up to the counter (which was in sneezing distance from the front door) and  I place my order. The cashier was either new or not awake, this was a seriously strenuous feat just to order lunch for three people. She kept going in circles, asking me questions that had already been answered, and ignoring questions that I had just to move on with her rehearsed prompts. $33 dollars for 3 meals later, I was waiting for my food.   The cashier asked me if I wanted my drinks now (sure, I'll take my cups and fill them in the cool new Coke machine with all the options that was advertised on your website, surely it must be around the corner......Nope. They had a min soda station behind the counter.  The Dr. Pepper tasted like the bag was empty and the ice tasted like it was made with filthy tap water. Fortunately I did not have to drink much of it because the 20 oz. cup was 18oz ice.   They shoved all three meals into one bag, which was so full you couldn't even close it, let alone have enough room to hold the bag closed. Add this to two to-go cups and it was fun trying to get it in and out of my car.  The fries were in an open basket, this made it fun when the unclosable bag fell over in my car.   I get the food back to work (5 minutes after it was placed in my hand) and we begin to eat our meals. It is here that I find the bag must of been too stuffed to the gills for them to put silly things like napkins or forks in. This made for a very cumbersome meal to (try to) eat.   The fries were cold, soggy, and tasted like they were coated in sugar. My wings (Hawaiian and teriyaki) were absolutely disgusting. The Hawaiian was savable with ranch, but still tasted like the bottom of someone's shoe. I have been to Hawaii, I have no clue what flavor profile of the state they were trying to emulate, whatever it was, they failed. The Teriyaki was absolutely dreadful. It literally tasted like someone poured BBQ sauce in a dirt field and then rolled chicken in it. I forced myself to eat one whole piece because I was so saddened to of spent so much money on 6 chicken wings, but it was just plain disgusting. The whole meal left a nasty after taste in my mouth.  I feel like I just threw my money down the drain, the food was disgusting, the service was pitiful, and the prices were astronomical.  Never, Never again, will I give this place my money.

I absolutely LOVE the West Coast vibe of this place.  And on a cool day I can actually pretend I am not in Phoenix.     I came on the second day they were open.... figured yesterday would be a zoo, so I skipped it.  I will admit I follow their AZ FB page, and it was not very well announced that they were opening one this weekend, I happened to stumble upon a post that hinted at it.... But I was glad I did.  My coffee was delish, the service was super fast and super friendly.  During regular hours it was not that much cheaper than Starbucks, but the flavor was better, the options better, and the service and atmosphere are WAY more fun!  Plus, I have noticed that they tend to have lots of specials, so definite plus!  This is now the closest one to me, but still a good 10 mile drive, so hopefully they will do well here and expand more into the SOUTHWest Valley!

First trip here was decent. Second trip was great. Our server was personable, beer was cold, food was hot.    Their house wings are made of crack, I'm not sure what is in this sauce, but I would totally buy it if they bottled it.  They have a poblano cream cheese that goes on this insane fire burger-seriously the burger is not for the faint of heart. Heartburn for days. However, the poblano cream cheese left me wanting more. I asked for it to be put on the Rachael instead of 1000 and slaw and it was amazeballs!!!!!  Beer is pretty good, decent selection of low IBU's, which I like. Wish happy hour was a bit more plentiful, but at least they have one.   Seating layout is weird, lighting on the southeast side could use some help.   Overall it's a win, I'm beyond happy to add a non-chain place to the rotation.

Avondale Jeep's service department is a joke!!  Super slow, over priced, and caused more harm than they fixed.
