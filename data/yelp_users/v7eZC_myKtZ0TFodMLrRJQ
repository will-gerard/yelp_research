It's Petco and I'm a huge fan of the company - great toys, a large selection of food and treats - nothing bad to say.

It's not often that I get to go to Super Walmart but when I do I make sure to spend my money's worth!  After getting a whole bunch of groceries I was happily shocked when the total was under $25... if we had gone to the grocery store everything we bought would have certainly been way more than that.  The store is also super clean and super big, I'd probably go there everyday if I lived there, the savings cannot be beat!

SUNDAY nights = Metal Head and Metal Head = 80's AWESOMENESS!  My review is based solely on Metal Head, an 80's/early 90's rock cover band that rocks Martini Ranch every Sunday night. It's a cheap $5 cover to get in and a must go!

I came here for the homemade Peach Ale and the Stoutamisu - and i loved both!  I'm not a beer or ale drinker, but the Peach Ale is a drink i could get used to! It's light, refreshing and has a prominent peach flavor, which is seriously tasty :)  As for the stoutamisu - i'm a huge fan of traditional tiramisu, so wasn't sure if i'd like this version. Once again, Four Peaks has proven me wrong (and so did my brother who insisted I try both). In this version, the lady fingers are soaked in Oatmeal Stout and has the most incredible chocolate cream covering the outside along with chocolate shavings! This is an awesome twist on the classic, especially since I usually don't like stout, i happily ate this dessert :) As for the portion, it's huge - i think one slice was the length of my forearm and the width my forearms combined!

I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.  The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.  The Angus burger at McDonald's has better flavor than this one, and that's pretty bad.

This place is certainly delicious, worth the wait on a special occasion (translation - not a place you frequent since the lines are so long) but "Best Pizza in America?" I think that title belongs to Di Fara's in NYC... but let's get to my review of Pizzeria Bianco.  We arrived nearly two hours before opening to find a line of 25 people and patiently waited for the restaurant to open. Around 4:30 p.m., Frank the owner came outside to tell everyone about the ingredients that are used, how the brick oven works and to thank everyone for their patience and patronage - he really is an awesome guy!  Once we got in the place (total wait time was 3.5 hours) we ordered: - Anti-pasta - Margherita  - Wise Guy - Bianca Verde - Rosa   The anti-pasta was delicious but my favorite part was the bread that came with olive oil - this bread was seriously addicting! It was doughy, crisp and had a wonderful charred flavor (in a good way, not a bad way).  The margherita pizza was good but not my favorite, in fact, it tasted better room temperature.  The wise guy had carmelized onions and their own blend of fennel sausage. This pizza was tasty as well, but again, not my favorite and tasted much better when it was room temperature vs. straight from the oven.  The two pizzas that were mind-blowingly delicious were the Bianca Verde and the Rosa. The verde had no sauce, mozzeralla and ricotta cheeses and was topped with arugala and drizzled with delicious olive oil. The combination was absolutely delicious! The pizza was creamy and wonderfully delicious!  The Rosa was equally amazing - a pizza with no sauce or cheese, instead incredibly delicious parmesan cheese covered the pizza and was topped with pistachios and onions! OMG, it isn't fair that something is this delicious!  I'll definitely come back to this place - primarily because I don't live in Arizona so it's a special treat - but next time I'd just stick with the Verde and Rosa pizzas, these truly are incredible!

I met my Aunt at the Pyramid Cafe for lunch when I was in town visiting and we each got the breakfast combo - two eggs, bacon, homefries and silver dollar pancakes.  The breakfast was alright, though the pancakes were really weak - they were thin and tasteless. If you have time, I'd recommend going to another hotel to grab some quality food.

OMG this place is SO MUCH FUN! We came here for a round of mini-golf and we all had such a great time.  We chose the optical illusion course and it was definitely challenging but all in all so much fun. Next time, I want to try the bungee bounce and go to the batting cages.  This is such a fun place to bring the family, friends or a date!

As a New Yorker there's nothing I love more than pizza and a great sandwich - so I was excited to check out Chloe's Corner after reading some of the great reviews.  Unfortunately I was hugely disappointed by the quality of the sandwiches. I got the turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and mustard on cranberry walnut bread and the sandwich was dry... the bread lacked flavor, the turkey tasted gamey instead of having a nice roasted flavor to it and the cranberry sauce was barely on it.  I also got a cup of the tomato soup, which was good but nothing extraordinary.   Personally, I wouldn't bother with this place - a sandwich shop that doesn't make good sandwiches is not worth the money.

This place seriously has the best coffee, lattes, hot chocolate and chai tea i've ever had, period!  I was visiting my brother and he insisted on taking me here, to which I replied, I only drink hot chocolate, no coffee or tea. Well, did i eat or should i say drink those words.  We ordered a latte, chai tea and hot chocolate and i was singing their praises all the way home. This is not an ordinary coffee shop - all three drinks were rich, creamy and had wonderful flavors - i was completely blown away!  If i lived here, i'd definitely be a coffee and chai tea drinker, but sadly i don't - though this place is on my "must visit" list next time i'm in town.

I can't say enough awesome things about BC Flightlines and the bottom line is if you're in Vegas then this is a must!  Our tour guides - Alex, Kyle and John were really fun guys and made us feel safe the entire time - even my friend who is deathly afraid of heights had a blast.  We opted for the 8 a.m. tour because we didn't want to be baking in the desert sun and it worked out perfect.   As for the experience itself, it's amazing and such a blast - the ziplines are really fast and the scenery is breathtaking - and there's 4 lines in total, so you get to fly through over the desert and mountains a few times :)  This is a definite must if you're visiting Vegas!

Definitely a restaurant that I'd go back to. My brother took us here while we were visiting him in town and the scenery was breathtaking, the service was fantastic (thanks to our awesome server Dennis) and the food was very good.  We started with the guacamole and trio of salsas and all of us were super impressed with the flavor of both appetizers and the delicious chips.  Moving on to the main course, I got a bleu cheese bacon burger, which was good - not the best I've ever had but certainly a good burger.  As for the drinks, I had two different types of margaritas and enjoyed both. This is certainly a great place to enjoy the views and hang out with friends.

Incredibly RUDE service! Skip this place and go to Cartel.  We came here for some coffee and closing time was nearing so we got our coffees to go. However, as we were waiting for our last coffee to be made one of the employees - a tall, scruffy, blonde haired guy who tries to be too cool for his own good says: "As much as I love your company, we're closing so it's time for you to go" in a very sarcastic, rude tone.  We all looked at him in shock, and my friend said, "we'll go when my coffee is ready," to which he responded with a smirk. Five minutes later we're still waiting and we go to the counter and ask where the coffee one of the employees says, "Oh, I forgot about it, it's been sitting here" - so instead of a hot cup of coffee, we got a cold cup of coffee, which wasn't even good.  Needless to say, we'll never patron this spot again.

This place needs way better reviews because I fell in love with the tacos here!  I got the carne asada and the adobada taco - both were good and had gigantic portions of meat, guacamole and other toppings but the flavor of the carne asada was absolutely amazing!  If I lived in Scottsdale, I'd easily become a regular here!

I stayed here for work and this hotel was awesome! The rooms were quite large and very modern, I had a nice-size flat panel LCD, the bed was really comfortable along with the dozen or so pillows you get, the bathroom was nice and the vanity/dressing area was quite large.  The staff is also great and very friendly and there's a bar and restaurant on-site so you don't need to go out for dinner (they also have room service).   This place exceeded my expectations and I'd stay here again.
