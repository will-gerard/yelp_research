Always get in fast, foods always great, wonderful customer service. One of the few places I'm not afraid to order something different because it is always delicious.

All their reviews said they were 15 minutes early and they ended up being 1 hour and 40 minutes late, 2 hours for me waiting total, but did receive apologies and a discount! Also didn't ask about which room to deliver certain boxes. Besides that the were quick and professional. We would use them again.

Long waits. Inexperienced personnel. Bad parking lot. Still trying to get back an unknown surprise $250 dollar charge on our bill that they couldn't understand or explain to us. Said they'd call us and didn't. We've come in three times now and can't seem to resolve it with this location. Huge waste of our weekends time. We are very unhappy with this store and service and are now seriously considering leaving at&t.

Poor service. Poor communication. Poor deals. I wouldn't ever go back to this store. Can't give us answers of delivery time. Get out on hold for 20 minutes. Deliver broken appliances which we will return. Get what you pay for.

Typical car salesmen. I will not buy from them ever. My wife and I came in with specific models and prices and they did not work with us. They were rude and made us very uncomfortable. Disrespectful and a huge waste of time.
