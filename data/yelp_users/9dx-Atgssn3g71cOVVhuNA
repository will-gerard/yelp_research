I walked in a few months ago to this location and found that service was HORRIBLE. The high schooler behind the counter was rude and very condescending when we asked if she could change gloves for a vegan. We had the employee then roll her eyes and then take a drive through order instead completely ignoring us. Don't come to this location if you are a vegan\vegetarian

I love coming here for all of my home needs. Friendly service and great staff to joke around with. I have never had a bad time in here. The only problem that I have is from time to time it is a little under staffed at 5 but what place isn't.

I came here with some of my family yesterday. This is going to be my new go to for any Mediterranean food or cooking needs. Not only was the food some of the best that I have had in all of AZ the markets selection was amazing. Lots of tea and coffee selections to be had as well as better prices than most grocery stores. Also for the hookah inclined those looking for the best go no further. From Khalil Mamoon's the best hookahs money can buy to AF Shisha. This is going to be a one stop shop for my needs in the valley. Also the owner is very nice and willing to help with any questions from making Turkish Coffee this place has true passion for customer service.

I was introduced to this place by my Girlfriend on our anniversary. She has been coming here for year. I cannot begin to say enough about the service and the since of community that is present here. The food sealed the deal thought the Lamb is amazing and also go for the tomato to die for because it is. I could ramble all day about how good it is but all I have to say is go and you will not be disappointed.

I heard of the legendary service from Hiland's on Youtube. I decided to pop in and get some snow flake tobacco. I was a little lost when I first came in. Soon after I met Scott the legend is true such happy and helpful staff can't be found anywhere else. I will be coming back here for all of my needs. There is nothing better in AZ.

Ok Irish nachos and beer. I will say the service for a table of 20 was amazing. I just never felt like it was a great experience. I have been back a few times after my first visit. This place has gotten much much better in the past couple of months! This is now one of my favorite places in Tempe.

Great food and service every time. With out question ether location for me is a go to restaurant. The Wendy Pickle with OG sauce is the best thing to have here for me. I will continue to come here as long as I am in phoenix for my Green fix. This is coming from an avid meet eater who loves everything food. I find this to be one of my favorite spots in phoenix.

Great coffee in a comfortable environment. I love the couches and the DJ that was there that day. I have to say this is one of the few places that I have been with a great espresso shot. Many other places I have been burn the crap out of it. The espresso here was amazing!!! I will be back.

I have been here many many many times. I live down the street and have never had any issues other than a few people having fun and the bar and yelling at times. Other than that great service and food it to be had here.   Edit:Last time I went the food was sub par and no longer Vegan friendly.

I recently moved to the area and found tat this Wild Flower was down the street. I found that the service was quick and done right. The food came out in about 6 min. The soup bread bowl was great gotta love that potato cream cheese soup. And the sandwich didn't fall apart. I will definitely be coming back to this location.

My boss picks up Burritos and Fruit smoothies from this place quite often. The food is always good but not mind blowing. I see this as being a great quick stop breakfast. Worth the stop in if you don't have time to make breakfast. I will be returning on my own accord for burritos for hiking and such in the future.

Veggies not cooked and my bowl was watery. This was my first time at this restaurant and i think my last. Food was not great and the store was kinda dirty and needed a good sweeping. The only ok thing was my sushi and even that was border line ok. Good alternative to panda express in my eyes.

How is this place always so busy and understaffed!!!!!!!! You can't come in here without waiting in line for at least 30 min. Run run far away.

I loved coming here the other day lots of the food I love to cook with at amazing prices. The only problem I had was the place is a little messy. This could just be because of a busy weekend. If so I will edit to 5 stars. But I will be doing most if not all of my shopping here.

I have been here about 4 times now. It has become my go to Thai place in Phoenix. Great portions and very well spiced. The soups are amazing and for the Pad Thai inclined don't think just order. Food separation for Vegetarian is great and I cannot give enough praise for the staff and how friendly they are. I will be back any time I want Thai.

This is one of those great quite places that you can have a morning meeting in or just relax and enjoy your day.  The food is always great. The service is some of the best that you can ask for. I love the corn beef and fried egg as well as the biscuits and gravy. Oh and lets not forget the coffee I would go there just for a cup of coffee and a quite place to read a book. If you are looking for a good morning out with amazing breakfast look no further.

As a pipe smoker this is one of the best places to go in Phoenix. Quite and tons of selection. I feel welcome every time I come and everyone behind the counter is ready to answer questions. My only gripe is that While the lounge is nice it isn't anything to write home about.

Some of the best ramen I have had in Arizona. This is a vegetarian friendly place with amazing soup. While the menu is slightly confusing at first the staff was wonderful at explaining the steps and I will be going back often.

I come in here from time to time to get a fresh cup of coffee. I love that the staff knows everything that they are serving and where it is from. I just find that the place is a little quite from time to time. Some music on the patio would be great. But that is my little gripe for this place otherwise it is perfect in every other way.

I love this store!!! Great small town feel with the best prices of anywhere in the valley. While I think other stores are more "professional" this place will get my money every time. Nice people willing to help anyone and every one that comes through the door. Even on busy days someone will stop and make sure you are taken care of. If you are new to firearms this is where you need to go! If you are a seasoned buyer the people here know their stuff and if it is quite enough are passionate about their trade and love to talk about what they have in the store.

Best burger and service I have had in a long time.  1.The burger and fries that I had at this restaurant was the best I have had in a long time. Cooked properly and seasoned perfectly. Fries were fresh cut potato and well disappeared off my plate.  2. The server was kind good at giving recommendations and made the experience that much better. my drink never got empty and attention was paid to what we needed for the table. I have never been more pleased with a wait staff in a long time.  The only gripe I have is parking and the ability to get in can be a little annoying but a good hole in the wall none the less.

This is the best Caffe that I have ever been to ever...  1. The best Italian food that I have had hands down no question. 2. The owner even though it was a full night found us a table and even gave us a free Antipasta.  3. If you have any question on going here don't just do it. You will not find a more down to earth staff and owner anywhere in Old Town.

The other night I was looking for a good burger and fries. I found this on google maps right down the street from my house. I decided to try it out. This is the best kind on small burger shack that you can have. Quick service, friendly staff, and AMAZING burgers. This even beats out my favorite burger place In-and-Out. Better ingredients better flavors and local. I will be back and next time I will be needing a jar of Stand Sauce for my fries.

I just went in on a whim last night. This is the best Pizza in AZ that I have had yet. The place is very Vegetarian friendly and everything from the food to the service had been the best that I have had in Phoenix. As I said I walked in last night looking for a new pizza place while moving to the area. Gina was friendly and accommodating beyond what I expect from any food service. I have never felt more welcomed to a restaurant ever. The best part is that not only was the service amazing but the food will keep me coming back alone it is the best I have had ever. I will be recommending this restaurant to everyone I know,

Best bagels in town no question.  Friendly service and great food. I get a plain with jalapeno cream cheese and there are great chunks of jalapeno in it I can't ask for more from this place. Also the coffee is just as good as the bagels that is to say amazing.

Great food and great service. If you are wondering what the food is like it is a pot pie of sorts with many different fillings to choose. There is no better comfort food than this on a friday night :)

Great location this is a well oiled team working on the lunch shift during the week. I have come here many times and had great service that was fast and friendly. Everything that I could ask for in a lunch time hang out. I will also say the food separation for Vegans\Vegetarians is great and the employees don't mind changing gloves and that is a HUGE plus in my book.

Wonderfully forgettable  1. Food was bland, tasteless, and the bottom of my bowl was filled with water. 2. Service was among the worst I have had in a long LONG time. i.e. Water being spilled on our group, snarky comments when there was and issue with the food. 3. While this was a bad experience the manager didn't notice the entire time all of this was going on. When we did bring her attention to the issues she did make it right but to little  to late.
