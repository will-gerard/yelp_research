I have been referred to go here by 3 different people and I finally went today.  Wow! This place is awesome!  Yes, it is crowded but it didn't bother me a bit.  It was actually a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend oohing and aahing at all the choices and the ridiculously low prices!!  It seems like everything was under a dollar or maybe just over... I got 3 heavy bags full of stuff for $15 which included quite a few things that are pricey in the regular grocery stores this time of year....  I'm definitely now inspired to cook up something good from my fully stocked fridge!

Awesome wings!!  Hot wings at local sports bars are the best.. and these are some of the best in Phoenix....  good ol' medium or hot flavor is what I prefer and I order them extra crispy.  I have been a customer for the last 7 years and have gone to most of the locations.... always great!

I've been coming here for about 8 years and I don't trust anyone else to do my hair!! Every time I've ever had anyone else touch my hair  I've been completely unhappy.  I'm VERY particular.  And every time I've gotten my hair done at Altered Ego, I leave happy!  The salon is beautiful and relaxing... I love coming here!!!

Nice, basic breakfast or lunch spot if you're just dressed casual but want some good food. Lots of patio tables outside to sit at when the Arizona weather is nice. I tried the Fontina Burger which was featured on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives and I absolutely recommend it! Also the beet salad was fresh and tasty... Great option instead of fries for no additional price. Blueberry cheesecake was realllllly yummy.  I'll be back for sure!

Great place to sit on a quiet patio for breakfast/brunch. It's casual and affordable, quick and yummy! Try the San Diegan omelette! I'll be back next time I'm visiting Phoenix!

This is where it's at.  Guys... the definition of "wine and dine"... yes go here!  I believe it is now called "Drinkwaters"... but it's still one of the mastro's so I don't care what they call it, this place is awesome!!!  The steak comes sizzling on the plate, you can smell it from across the room.  Fancy, classy, but still laid back... you can wear your cutest pair of jeans :)  Cool atmosphere with some live music, a busy bar, fireplace, and then a white tablecloth, service at it's best, low-light dining room.  Perfect date spot if you want to spend a penny or two and really impress her.   The seafood tower is TO DIE FOR.  You have to order a steak for your main course and the warm butter cake is the perfect finale.  Oh City Hall... I dream of you often..........

for a cheap, fast, "get my gyro and go" type joint.... this is the bomb!!  I'm used to checking out gyro spots all over phoenix with my friend from Chicago who can never find one that "makes gyros like they do in the Chi"... well this place does!!  they don't skimp on the meat and they don't fuss it up with all the other stuff like the sit down places do.... just good meat, soft pita, and really yummy tzatziki sauce (order extra).  The staff is cool and within a couple months they knew my name.  Chandler folks looking for a good lunch spot need to check it out!

update! ...been going there for years... went back recently and they still know my name, and still make the best gyro i've had in Phoenix!  They are obviously doing something right, there was a line to the door last time I went... which i had never seen there before.  I took my gyro back to work and all my co-workers were in amazement at how good it looked, how big it is, how much meat they give you, etc etc... of course i couldn't talk i was too busy enjoying every bite ;)  the less than 5 star reviewers didn't get the traditional gyro... so i suggest you order that.  It's mouth watering... and also I'll vouch for the chicago guy.. the pizza puffs there are great too! ;)

Ok it's a cool looking place... was super happy when I walked in and anticipated this would be a great date night.  I was seated to a table and proceeded to watch all the servers walk past me for 15 minutes (seemed like an hour).  Some even made eye contact and smiled! lol Anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant would know that they should have immediately noticed that I had no drink, no one tending to me... TERRIBLE service!  Finally after none of the (completely not busy) servers helped me... I walked up to the hostess stand and asked for a server PLEASE.  Finally the one busy waitress came up to me apologizing over and over that she did not realize I was her table.  I couldn't even be mad at the girl... she was busting her butt, but her co-workers.... definitely should have noticed me and helped her out by letting her know.  To make a short story long... the first 20 minutes being there pissed me off for the entire night and ruined it.  The food was just ok.  Service was terrible.  Pork belly was amazing.

I've gone to Ultimate Body Boot Camp for about 5 months and i LOVE working out here!  The trainer, Richelle, is awesome.... she keeps it fun, and she is hilarious!! Anyone who says otherwise needs to put their big girl panties on..... seriously!! ;0)  She challenges you, but not in an intimidating way that makes you want to never come back.... she challenges you in a way that makes you want to do your best!  I love getting a workout so good that it's hard to walk the next day..... and this is the place to get it!
