Great location, nice quaint studio, pretty good prices. Patrick is a world class yoga teacher - his classes are the BEST

The pool is 5 stars. The Hole in the Wall has a great lunch menu. The restaurant has a great setting, is good for children & families. When we ate there for dinner tonight I was really disappointed.  It took so long for them to get our food out. My ribs were tough & my husbands steak was really undercooked. We won't be back for dinner.

When we visit Vegas again, we will definietly be back. The food was incredible and the chef had us laughing so hard it hurt! Tiger the owner/ Chef made my friends 40th birthday party experience unforgettable! :) Looking forward to the next time!

One of the most amazing steakhouses I have ever been to. The filet Mignon and the aged ribeye were incredible. It's every bit worth the price.

My favorite small music venue in Phoenix! Great place to catch Phoenix live local music.
