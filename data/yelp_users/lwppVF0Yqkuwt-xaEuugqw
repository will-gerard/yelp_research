Another favorite happy hour place!  They have good deals on beer and a couple food items.  I used to get the twisted breadsticks, but for some reason they took them off the menu.  Don't worry, if you ask for them, they'll make 'em.  :)  Service is great here....attentive and quick for how busy it usually is around 5pm.  Oh yes, and single ladies should definitely be here for happy hour - lots of men!  Probably married men let out for a few hours on a weekend....but men nonetheless!  And for the fellas, there are a lot of good looking waitresses....very cute.

Well, once you hear that you have a 3.5 hour wait for pizza next door, this would seem like the logical place to go to wait it out.  And it definitely was.    Delicious wine, new beer for the boys to try, and a yummy food plate all equaled a great experience!  Service could have been a tad bit more attentive, but it was busy and we weren't that concerned.   Oh yes, and the secret drawer....  :)

Wow - I have to admit I was impressed!  When a coworker suggested a bunch of us go here for lunch, I was a little weary.  A buffet?  Ewwww....  But no!  It was delicious!  The salad bar was fresh, staff were actively replenishing everything, it was clean, and there were a lot of great choices.  I greatly appreciated the vegetarian and low fat/healthy labeling and options.    I can't believe I'm going to admit this, but I'll definitely be back!!

Silent Sunday is my favorite day of any month!  What a great idea!  We ran the 5.5 miles from the parking lot up to Dobbins Point on the paved road, and love the comradery of everyone out being active and enjoying the day.  The 5.5 miles down was definitely the best part though - but watch out for the bikes and skate boarders!  The only disappointment is all the broken glass beer bottles on the side of the road....I wish people would take care of their parks.

I love CPK.  I have had great experiences at the CPK in Chandler and Scottsdale.  However, this location scorned me twice.    I always, always, always order the Tricolore Salad with the dressing on the side.  It's so good!  When I went to this location several weeks ago, I noticed that I was skimped on arugula, and a lot of it was wilted.  The salad was mostly those thick red leaves I don't like.  Last night, again, they skimped on arugula and it just didn't seem like a fresh salad.    Keep in mind, between those two visits I had the same salad at the Chandler location and it was delicious.  Lesson learned.

I've been to these outlets a few times to hit up Polo, Gap, and maybe Nike but didn't find anything else that got me excited.    Well, that all has changed!  We spent several hours there perusing Polo, Gap, Under Armour, Pearl Izumi, Banana Republic, and J.Crew!  I've never seen my husband so happy shopping!  We definitely walked away with some great stuff at great prices!  I'm sure this will be a trip we'll make a few times a year to stock up!

Mmmmm Floridinos! The calzone is the most amazing thing on the menu and I have yet to find a comparable calzone anywhere else.  In fact, I ate the whole thing and then felt so guilty that I had hike up to Siphon's Draw the next morning.  Fair trade off, I'd say!  Our group of 4 also enjoyed pizza muffins and salads, and all left happy and full.  A great, local pizza joint!

Pesto's - where have you been all my life?!?!?!  It was my pick Saturday night for dinner, only to find out my hubby had been for lunch a couple years ago.  Boy, was he surprised!  Who knew such a cute wine/pizza/pasta place was inside?  The decor is gorgeous - and I loved the beaded curtain and high top tables!    As for food - I had the BEST Calzone (the Pesto) I've ever had!  It wasn't too cheesy and the sauce on top was perfect.  We also loved Pesto's take on the caprese, with greens added.  There were lots of options for wine too.    The hubby tried the pepperoni pizza and said it was "okay", but he's picky when it comes to pizza.  Granted, we did go early but there were too many kids for my liking.  If you're looking for a more "adult" environment, I'd suggest sitting in the bar area.  As we were leaving, they were setting up some live music.  We'll definitely be back!!

I've been a patient here for several years now, and more frequently these days now that I'm pregnant!  My experience started out a little rough, with what seemed like a lot of staff turn over.  However, the past year has been a great experience.  The office is gorgeous, there's no getting around that!  Plenty of seating, television to watch, vending machines, small play area for children, and free wi-fi!  The staff I've come in contact with have been friendly and helpful, and I've never had to wait beyond my appointment time.  Since getting pregnant, I see Dr. Moore every month and he's been great.  It's also nice that I can get blood work done and have an ultrasound in the same office - very convenient!    I'm sure I'll continue to be a patient here for all my womanly needs!

Yum! Yum! Yum!    Friends introduced us to this place - they're regulars and we may be too.  It's a hidden place, but once you find it you are welcomed into a gorgeous restaurant with plenty of space.    They have a good sized drink menu, and my first "Yippee!" happened when I saw they had choices for margaritas that didn't include syrup and sweetness that you can get with margarita mixes.  I could actually taste (and later feel!) the tequila.    My second "Yippee!" happened when I was informed that the Chile con Queso was (gasp) vegetarian!  It was absolutely delicious and hot and if I wasn't watching my athletic figure I would have chowed down on it and the thick chips that go with it.    My third "Yippee!" happened when I saw black beans on the menu.  Black beans that are lard free!  My black bean and cheese burrito was amazing - not too greasy, just the right amount of cheese.  They also had more vegetarian choices, and I'll have to try the Spinach Enchiladas one of these days.    Loved everything about this place - will definitely be back!  But not on Tuesdays, since I'm not interested in seeing kids eating free.

I'm still a member here, mostly because it's so close.  I've been trying to keep my workout outside, but since it's getting so hot out I've had to head back inside.    I went in around 11:30am on a Friday, and was bombarded with outside sales going on in the lobby.  You want a scented candle?  How about some jewelry?  Try a new antioxidant drink?  Geez!  It made the entrance crowded and looked unprofessional.  I'm guessing Mountainside gets a cut, otherwise I'm not sure why they would allow this.    Luckily, the sales people associated with these products don't go overboard in there selling tactics, but still.  It's not something that belongs in the gym (unless you have a separate boutique like the Village - love!!).    Our prepaid year is almost up, so I'm thinking we'll be going elsewhere and sacrificing the drive.

Our pool is little.  As in approximately 14 feet by 6 feet, in the perfect shape of a rectangle.  My husband had been paying $70-something a month for a pool service to come to our house, test the water, and maybe add a chemical or two.    Now, we're looking for ways to cut costs so we headed to Leslie's to see how simple it was to do it ourselves.  Let me tell you, it's simple!  The man we worked with didn't diss pool services, which was nice and respectful, but he did say that taking care of our pool on our own was going to be very easy.    Leslie's lets you bring in your pool water to be tested, free of charge, once a month.  They will then let you know what chemicals you need to add to balance the water again.  It's that easy!  I'm so happy we decided to save money and rely on Leslie's!

This is the Hamilton Branch of a Chandler Library, and literally right inside Hamilton High School.  I approached with my head down, because I'm scared of high schoolers, but luckily I didn't have to go into the high school to get to the library.    I'm not sure what it's like during the day, but after school is out it's full of students and some random parents with their young children.  It's a smaller than normal branch, but they have a decent selection of books and dvds.    It's definitely worth it to drive a couple miles north to the big location in downtown Chandler!

Mmmm - they have a great vegetarian sandwich that I just can't resist!  The bf and I went for lunch on a Sunday and were happily surprised to find that they weren't busy.   The guy taking lunch orders was super friendly, and didn't mind that I'm a picky vegetarian - a big plus in itself!  Always had a positive experience here!

I stopped by this shop yesterday to get my first pair of cycling shoes and cleats.  They had a small selection of maybe 6 shoes ranging from around $50 to $150.   I was clueless, and was thankful when Cody came over to help me.  He did a great job explaining to me the difference in shoes and cleats, as well as talking to me about my needs.  He showed me sizes and I picked out a middle range pair that could take me from spinning class to road biking.    The shop was empty so Cody took the time to talk to me about getting a road bike, something I need to do in the next month.  I really liked that he respected my price range, and actually encouraged me to start with the basics and not go all out buying the best (ie expensive) equipment.  Refreshing!  He showed me a catalogue of competitive road bikes in my price range, and hopefully they'll have those in soon - I'll be back!!    Apparently they have a shop in Ahwatukee, and are opening 2 new stores.

The boyfriend and I adopted a family of 5 through the City of Phoenix Adopt-A-Family program, and I immediately thought of Kohl's for the more bang for our buck experience.  The store is always clean, well organized, and easy to navigate.  Plus, everyone knows they are always having a sale!    We were able to purchase clothing, shoes (Nike, Addidas, Reebok), and a couple games for the family of 5 for $411.  Then, after applying for a credit card that didn't have to be our payment of choice for our purchases that day, we saved 20%....bringing us toooooo.....$330!!  PLUS, on TOP of that, we received $60 in Kohl's Cash - holla!!!!!    Overall, a great discount for those that are looking to save some money.

I came in today to get my husband a new phone, since he's still rockin' the Razor circa 1999 (and pay as you go no less!!).  I did my research and found out he was interested in the Samsung Moment with Google and we could add a data plan on to mine.  Sweeeeeet.  Maybe 30 minutes later I was all set, and the two men working were super friendly and helpful.  You could tell that they do whatever they can to make the customer happy.  Definitely check them out if you're in need of Sprint help!

My go to, absolute favorite grocery store.  Sure, I love Trader Joe's and Whole Foods for specialty items for dinner or entertaining but they aren't one stop shops like Safeway.    This location has recently gone through a renovation and a lot of great changes.  The staff are friendly and helpful too.    Just beware, the snow birds flock here and sometimes hold up the lines while writing checks or scrounging around for exact change, so come with some patience.

I love this speciality running store!  If you're getting into some regular running, want to start, or need a good pair of running shoes definitely come here and get their expert advice.  They'll get you fitted with a great pair of shoes, have you run for them, and really know their stuff.  There's also a great stock of clothing and accessories.    SRC also offers group runs and put together a great pre race tent for PF Chang's Rock n Roll 1/2 marathon and maration.  It may be hard to find back in that corner, but definitely try them out!

So happy to walk into Active Body and not get the snobby sales people!  They have a nice selection of active wear, as well as nice jeans, tops, and dresses.  I usually pick up a few pair of Twisted Heart flip flops once or twice a year, and stop in often just to browse.  Pricey, like you would expect, but worth it for the nice service.

This place can be hard to find because it's tucked away in the Agua Caliente strip mall area off of Shea, but it's back there.  I usually just run in for some bagels, and they are always fresh - my favorite is definitely the sunflower one!  On Saturday and Sunday mornings it can be a little chaotic up at the front counter because they don't do a line or numbers, but the wait is never long.    Only gripe is that I usually grab a coffee, and although they have creamer and flavored syrup available (a plus!), there's no milk.    No biggie, since I'd much rather support local businesses than a large chain.

Wow - John and Rob were my saviors!  After months and months of wedding planning, flowers were the one thing that I put off.  I checked out several different places and didn't have any luck finding someone who would work with a limited budget yet still be able to create something beautiful.    I had just about given up until a friend mentioned Flora Bella.  I called and told them my dilemma - my wedding is in two weeks and I have a small budget!  No worries, they said, we'll take care of you....and that's what they did!    We worked together to create a simple and elegant centerpiece and gorgeous bouquets.  I received exactly what I wanted for a reasonable price, and couldn't have been happier!    On a side note, they aren't necessarily in the store or available by phone during their business hours but rest assured, if you leave a message they'll get right back to you!

I've been going to this place for pedicures and the occassional manicure or acrylics for over a year now, mainly because it's conveniently located for me.  They always do a good job, prices are very reasonable, and Pita Jungle and JUJU are right next door!  I actually like getting mani's and pedi's without having someone talk my ear off, so this place is perfect.  Over the past couple months they went through a renovation and have a new manager/owner - so things have looked up.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I'm such a fan of Jamba Juice when I want a quick, healthy snack or lunch replacement.  You can get anything from a Jamba light drink to a thicker smoothie with yogurt and lots of extras.    I stuck with the light Berry Fulfilling, because then I could get a larger size for equal calories of course!  It was delicious!  I got the Original size and it was huge.  Definitely plenty.    They also have some healthy snacks (Clif Kids bars!) and is a fantastic option when you want something fast.  I think I'm craving another one today!

After feeling that nagging feeling that I need to get an oil change one of these days, I finally had time to swing by this Jiffy Lube after a morning workout.  I showed up at 7:15am, saw they had a light on, and went right in.  Turns out they don't open til 7:30am, but they were friendly about my earlier arrival and told me they'd be with me as soon as they finished opening the store.    Right at 7:30am they got my car in, serviced it, and I was out in about 20 mins.  I was made aware of additional service needed, with NO PRESSURE!  A big plus for me....I hate pressure.    Definitely a quick, friendly place to get an oil change!

Oh black beans....how I love thee.  Blue Burrito Grille has a healthier menu, such as those black beans and whole wheat tortillas, which is great.  I've came here to both pick up a meal and sit down and eat.....never having to wait more than 5 minutes for my food.  They have several high top tables, outdoor patio seating, a yummy salsa/chip bar, and alcohol.  The house margarita is okaaay.    Bottom line....if I'm feeling "fast" mexican food and a lot of it, I'll head to Chipotle and down a burrito.  When I'm feeling health conscious, I head here.

In this economy, I've grown to be a fan of never paying full price.  Hence my visits to Arizona Mills.  I made the mistake long ago of exploring the whole outlet mall, and it made me feel gross.  The crowds, the stores......ick.  But I did find a diamond in the rough.    I'm in love with Saks Off Fifth.  It's the best outlet store EVER!  Never buy a full price pair of True Religion, Seven for All Mankind or Joe's Jeans ever again (and they have a couple other brands but those are my fav) - go here and get them for right around $100.00!!  They also have a good selection of dresses, tops, and casual stuff like Juicy Couture as well as designer shoes and sunglasses.   Now I'm the type of person that absolutely hates digging through racks of clothing at Marshall's or even Nordstrom Rack, and it is nothing like that here.  The jeans are folded neatly by brand, and everything is well organized and clean.  Even the dressing rooms!  There's a great selection of designer men's clothing as well.    Also, get on their mailing list because I frequently get an extra 20% off purchases.

As far as outlet and discount stores go - this is the best of the best!  Places like Nordstrom Rack, Marshall's, Ross, etc. make my head spin with all the unorganized racks.  You will not find that here!  Everything is well organized and there is usually several of each item.  Great selection of designer jeans, cute tops and accessories.  Also love the men's stuff, although too trendy for the boyfriend.

As a beginner triathlete, I was in desperate need of a road bike....especially since I have a few races already on the calendar.  I'm a swimmer, I'm a runner, but I'm NOT a biker......so the whole idea was intimidating.  As was the idea of buying a road bike.  BUT, after saving up and doing some research I was off....    First stop, Landis.  I entered the store and was greeted by a person at the counter.  When I said I wanted to buy a road bike (making it clear I was here to purchase and not just browse), he went to find another person to help me.  I was asked my price range, and yes, I get it, $900 doesn't get me fancy but hey, I didn't want fancy.  He couldn't show me anything on the floor in my size, so he called the Scottsdale store to see their availability.  After maybe 10 mins he comes back to tell me they have the least expensive Trek bike for women but it's in a box and not built.    Okaaaaay......???  Silence from my sales associate.  Finally he says, well, you could have them build it for you and call you when it's done.  Okaaaay.....???  Silence from my sales associate.    Okaaaaay.....thanks for your help.   I can only describe this customer service as snobby and uninterested.  Sorry I'm a beginner.  Sorry I'm not a man.  Sorry I don't have $1500 to spend on a road bike.  But I was there to buy, and was very disappointed in the way I was treated.  Side note:  At my second stop, Performance Bike (see review), I encountered another woman buying a road bike who had been to Landis earlier that day.  And we both received the same customer service.  Apparently, women who are beginners are not welcome there.  Very disappointing.

Well, I was forced to return here to drop my bike off to be shipped to Ironman Wisconsin through Tribike Transport.  Good, I thought, maybe they'll make it back into my good graces.  Nope.  Sure, I dropped my bike off an hour before the deadline...my fault.  I asked if they could do a quick look over if they have time before it's picked up, and I got a straight up "No, we can't".  Oookkaaaaay.  And then, I got no "Good luck", even though it was obvious I was dropping it off to go to Wisconsin for an IRONMAN!  Geez....it's kinda a big deal, ya know?  Don't they have a triathlon team?    Then, when I picked it up, I didn't even get a "How did your race go?".  Nothing.  I mean, can't a girl brag a little?  That was your last chance Landis.  Peace.

A great, newly remodeled lunch place for us state employees!  I was surprised to see such a nice looking restaurant in this area....maybe because I eat at my desk, maybe because the area is shady.  The menu has your regular mexican items, which means refried beans to yours truly.  That's okay, because I got a bean and cheese burrito and was happy to see it not smothered in melted cheese and a ton of sauce.  Although I'm sure you can get it that way if you'd like.  The chips and 2 salsa's were delicious, service was fast for a busy lunch crowd.    The inside looks really modern, without the cheap and cheesy looking mexican decor.  They have lots of space, and it's very clean.  Will definitely be back - hopefully for happy hour to try the margaritas!

Wow!  Carolyn saved the day!  After visiting Flora Bella and getting flowers arranged for my wedding at the last minute, they gave me Carolyn's card and told me to give her a call for my last minute linen needs.    I'm so glad I did!  I called Carolyn and she chatted it up with me, letting me know I have plenty of time and why don't I come down and look at colors?  So I went to the store/office (hard to find!). She showed me a couple of shades of purple and she showed me a couple of ways to tie the chair ties.  Carolyn was very upfront and helpful, and about 15 minutes later I had rented 80 dark purple chair ties at such an affordable price!  I came and picked them all up (it's extra if you want delivery/set up) and a week later I dropped them back off.  It was that easy!!  Carolyn is personable and great to work with too!

Oh. My. Goodness.  I never eat donuts, because I feel like they're a dessert that you should eat at breakfast and I don't ever feel like desserts at breakfast.  That makes sense, right?!  Well, my husband had just gotten a PR at the Fiesta Bowl Half Marathon and I'm pregnant, so that clearly justifies desserts at breakfast!  Hence, our first trip to Bosa.    I could smell that donut-y smell from outside the building - yummmmm!  A spell came over us and we bought a dozen donuts for the two of us.  They were delicious - my favorite was the Bavarian cream filled chocolate one.    These are definitely a special treat for me - but I'll be back!

We swung by after happy hour on a Friday, and were surprised that it wasn't busy and we were able to sit right down.  We chowed on the chips and salsa, and our waitress was happy to fill us up again.   For dinner, I had another yummy black bean and cheese burrito!  Everyone seemed pleased with their food and I just love quaint little downtown Chander.    Now if only they served Z'Teja's margaritas here....

My absolute favorite when ordering in!  Of course, being a simpleton, I only get the cheese pizza, but it's sooooooo good!  Just the right amount of cheese and sauce with a great fluffy, yet crispy crust.  And you must try the cheesy breadsticks, which I think only come family style....aka, huge!  It's the size of a small pizza covered in cheese, but yet not too greasy.    Prices are cheap, we get an X-tra large pizza and family order of breadsticks, and it's delivered in a consistent 45 minutes for $25 bucks with tip.  When I'm in the mood for a pizza party on my couch - this is where I call.

I love wine, but am not a wine snob.  With that being said, I love Kokopelli Winery.  It's a cute little place in downtown Chandler, and on the weekends they have a jazz band in the breezeway.  I always go for way to much wine and the Nosh Plate - a mix of cheeses, olives, bread, and CHOCOLATE!  Yum!  A great place to relax with girlfriends or go on a date.  Haven't had dinner here, so I can't speak on that, but love the inexpensive wine and always end up taking a couple bottles home.    Oh yes, and you should check them out in a couple weeks for the Kokopelli Krush - a grape crushing contest with prizes!  They block off some of the back near the parking lot and do tastings too.  Look for me - I'm the Kokopelli Krush champion from 2 years ago and last year I got 2nd!

Make no mistake - this isn't a mexican restaurant, and the menu seemed somewhat random to me.  Anywho.    My husband and I arrived early to head to the bar for a drink before our reservation.  I ordered a margarita, and loved the extra shaker that went along with it - nice touch!  The group arrived and we headed to the patio, which was made quite warm by the heaters.  We started with one order of the Chorizo Fundido, and were brought two big bowls of chips and salsa to go along with it.  Word on the street was that it was delicious, but as a vegetarian I withheld.  A little while later, we were served some yummy warm tortillas and butter - a nice treat!    There aren't many vegetarian options.  I was able to ask for the tacos with extra black beans instead of the meat, and our server was extra accommodating.  It came with 3 small tortillas and a plate full of lettuce, guac, beans, tomatoes, and rice.  It was good....but a little pricey for what it was.    Overall, this was an A-Ok restaurant but our server made it a Yay!  He was friendly and helpful.  He was professional.  He offered, pleasantly, to split checks for our group of 8 and even knew who was together.  Kudos to him!

I've been a resident here for almost 3 years, and I've been pleased with my time here.  First off, location is great for Scottsdale within walking distance to Sandbar, California Pizza Kitchen, At One Yoga, and a gas station, and plenty of other options within driving distance.  Approximately 10 minutes to both Kierland Commons, North, and Scottsdale Fashion Square, South.    My specific apartment is on the 2nd (top) floor, and the high ceiling and sky light make the living room fill with natural light.   We pay an average price for the area, 1100/month, and that's after 2 years of raising it.  I have always, always, always felt safe there, which is important for a single woman in her 20's.  There are 3 pools on site too.    As far as office/management, Karen is firm and can come across as harsh, but she is just doing her job.  Maintenance is AMAZING - after several days of my key sticking in the lock I called maintenance and in less than 30 minutes I had someone come up, look at the problem, get a new lock part, and fix it!  Good service, helpful attitude.    Only negatives would be parking on the weekend and that they don't accept UPS packages anymore, so you have to go to the Post Office to get them.  Annoying.  It's also noisy on the occassional Friday or Saturday night - but never bad enough that I couldn't sleep.

I spent my birthday weekend here, even though I live between Scottsdale and Chandler I wanted to get away.  First off, I love the atmosphere here because it's so relaxing, tranquil, and seems away from it all.  The room setup is unique, and you feel like you have your own private place.  We had the basic "Spa View" room and it had plenty of space, a private balcony, and a separate sitting area.    The infinity pool is gorgeous both day and night - and the view makes me appreciate living here.  During our hot day at the pool, the staff were amazing and attentive.  They offered  bottle water, ice water with lemon, and had several yummy drink options.  Definitely try the lemonade with fresh berries.     We weren't there long enough to have opinions on the staff or eat in the restaurant but everyone we came across was friendly.  It was also nice to be able to run to Camelback Mtn and do some hiking - despite the heat!

Yet another happy hour favorite, especially when it's a little cooler and you can enjoy the outside patio.  Lots of space, and good service.  I always get the Bavarian Pretzel - a favorite!  Others love the Beer Battered Chicken Strips with Chiptole Ranch, and if you're in for a (fattening!) treat get the Oatmeal Chocolate Stout shake.

So disappointed to have to write this!  Our large group of 12 came at around 4:00pm and were able to get 2 tables together pretty quickly, which was great.  Then our waitress was quick to get us started on drinks, again, that was great.    Then, a waiter came to our table and said he was taking over for our waitress and all the guys were so disappointed.  When I asked what the big deal was, one guy said men don't take care of people like women.  I thought okay, maybe he has a point.  Well, he definitely did have a point.  The waiter was HORRIBLE.  Not attentive, we sat with empty glasses for at least 10 minutes before he noticed, and several times we had to flag him down for more drinks and napkins and our check.    It was a bummer because the space is great, the beer is great, and the food is great.....but the service ruined our whole experience.

Alright, I admit, this is not my type of crowd or environment and that's part of the reason for the low rating.  Hey, you do it for the Scottsdale bars - so leave me alone!  Our group headed here after Oktoberfest for a few drinks, and after finding a long wait for Rula Bula we ended up here where it was pretty dead.  Inside, there were a bunch of older creeps creeping on the scantily clad bar staff.  Outside, it was cramped and stinky of smoke.  The service at the bar was just okay....not particularly friendly or fast.    I wouldn't return here because I'm not in college and I'm not an older creep.  If out on Mill, I'll stick to Rula Bula.

This hidden, beautiful, delicious restaurant is exactly why I L-O-V-E Yelp!  Last week the boyfriend suggested we go on a "date" and try something new, but preferably in Tempe since that's where we would be shopping prior.  Nothing came to mind, so I browsed Yelp and found Classic Italian Pizza.  It was love at first read.    Thanks to the prior reviews we were able to find it by searching for the Big Lots sign, and were greeted by a mostly vacant parking lot.  There, in the corner, the restaurant was glowing and inviting.  Upon entering we were surprised to find only 3 other tables full, and this was a Friday night.  Yippee!  No wait!    We started with the yummy brick oven bread, Caprese salad, a glass of pinot grigio, and Warka (polish beer)....which all came out quickly.  The bread held up to it's expectations - it was the perfect texture of chewy dough and light flavor, brought with a plate of marinara sauce and balsamic.  Next it was on to the pizza - Margharita for me and Pepperoni for the boyfriend.  Both were yummy, hot, and flavorful.  Every table has it's own bottle of olive oil, balsamic, parmesean, and red pepper so we were able to spice our pizza's up just how we like.  Mmmm!  For me, it's not only about the food it's about the ambiance and this place definitely has both.  It's cozy, pleasant, and when you're there you really feel like someone invited you to be in on the secret.

I love this place!  Not only does it make me feel happy and healthy, it makes me eat that way too!    I'm getting married in a couple months, and the future hubby and I have greatly limited our nights eating out and ordering in.  Our savior?  The whole wheat pizza dough!  Every Friday I stock up, and at least once (yes, sometimes twice!) we'll each make a pizza - soooo delicious.    The staff is friendly and helpful,  I can always find what I need, and in the rare occassion that something isn't up to standard returning it is a breeze.  Oh!  And the samples and wine selection are great too!

I must admit, I'm a tiny bit embarrassed that I LOVE this place.  When a group of us girls get together, pull out the party dresses, and break out the spray tans this is where we go!  First off, the place is huge with a large patio, so there's always somewhere to walk around and grab a drink (unlike PCL and SIX....too small and you only have room to stand there awkwardly until you've had 3 or 10 drinks).  The band, Envy, is the best thing about the place.....the 2 good looking guys and the cute girl put a ton of energy into performing top 40 stuff.     On top of that, the people watching......wow.  There's a big age range from 20's to 50's, and yes, the cougars are on the prowl and there are creepy guys a plenty.  That's part of the entertainment!    I haven't eaten here, so the 5 stars is definitely for a Friday or Saturday night out.

I love trying new restaurants when in Las Vegas!  I took one for the team, loving vegetarian wife that I am, and we headed here.  We were told the wait was 30 minutes for lunch, but oh no, it was more like 45 mins.  I hate that.    Anywho.  We had a really, really friendly waitress and got a great booth with our own television.  My husband took forevaaaaa picking a beer, but was impressed by the extensive selection.  For food I went with the greek salad, sweet potatoes fries, and a chocolate shake.  Who would've thought that they'd have a delicious greek salad for me to eat?!?!!  And the sweet potatoes fries were just right.  And the chocolate shake!  Wowsa!  I think part of my satisfaction is due to the fact that I NEVER eat fries or chocolate shakes, but still.    Definitely a good stand by when we return, but I'm not sure we'll make this our number one stop.  There's too many other places to eat!

Another stop for my bachelorette party.  We were able to make a table reservation (thx GK!) here without having to do bottle service, which was great!  Our group of 8 was shown to our table and immediately served drinks and shots and had a great time.  We were there around 10pm, so it wasn't too busy yet, but we had a good time anyway.  The "stripper" pole on the dance floor provided some good entertainment.    Always a great place to hit up when in Old Town!

My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Oregano's, go at least twice a month, and have been to every one in the Valley and the one in Flagstaff.  Clearly, it's my favorite!    First off, the service has always been extremely friendly and welcoming.  The North Scottsdale location has great customer service.  On one visit after waiting 45 minutes for a deep dish we were told it was wrong, and we were given the half that was correct, a new pizza, a drink for each of us, and the offer of dessert.   A second time, again after waiting 45 minutes, our pizza was dropped and we got a drink and our pizza for free.    We are in love with the thin crust, deep dish, and cheesy bread.  Can't say much for any thing else on the menu - we don't order it!  Definitely get a bellini if you're up for a drink - yummy!!  And a pizookie!!  Yes, the wait is around 45 minutes every day of the week, but most of the time they will let you put in a deep dish pizza order while you are waiting.   Love it!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed New York-New York yet!  My then boyfriend brought me here for my first time in Vegas and we've stayed here several times since.  It's definitely one of my favorite resorts on the strip!  There's now the daily resort fee, which at least includes two free drinks.  The rooms are small, but the beds are comfy and we loved the extra pillows.  There's plenty going on within the hotel, with lots of dining choices and bars.  Zumanity is here too, which is a great show.  My husband is also part of the Player's Club, and although he by no means spends a large amount of money gambling we got a great room rate offer.   Definitely one of my favorites in Vegas!

This show was sexy, hot, and hilarious!  Our seats were first row balcony, because based on past reviews we knew we'd be safe from involuntary participation.  The interaction with the crowd below us was so fun to watch, especially prior to the show starting.    The acts were, for the most part, incredibly sexy.  In a really good way. In a "I wish I could do that at home, and maybe after a couple drinks I might think I can, but instead end up with about 10 pulled muscles" sort of way.  Especially the 2 women in the water....wowsers!  Now that's talent!  An entertaining show all around!  Oh, and the margarita from the man upstairs was deeeeeeelicious!

I've been here several times now, and always have a good experience.  This time was no exception.  The bread is crunchy and tasty and the water constantly filled.  I went with the Margarita pizza, which was big enough to share....others at the table cleaned their plates and were satisfied as well.    Plus, you can't go wrong with the people watching - some people be crazy in Vegas!

Mmmmmm....we always make a trip here when we're in Vegas, although now there is one in Scottsdale so that takes some of the excitement out of it.    I'm usually in a group of 6 or more, and we've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table.  Service is good, which can be hit or miss when you're with a large group.  They start you off with warm bread, and will refill it if you ask.   I order the Pasta Telephono, it's amazing with toasted bread crumbs on top.  It's a big portion, so share or don't eat the whole day in preparation!  I've also had the Caprese Salad and the Greek Salad - two of my favorites.    The atmosphere is nice and is a great start or finish to a night out....we are never disappointed and always look forward to the next visit!

A girl friend and I headed here before our trip to shop for a wedding dress - I needed the half bottle of wine we ordered!  Was there a happy hour menu?  Happy hour prices?  We didn't ask, but didn't see anything advertised either.  We shared the plate of cheeses, bread, fruit, etc., and it was pretty tasty.  Loved the dried figs.  We also each ordered the greek (Uro? Oro?) salad, and agreed on the deliciousness of it.  I would definitely order that again.    Service was a little on the slow side, but we were chatting so much that it was no biggie.  I would love to return and try a few more menu items!

Mmmmm, this has been on my "To Try" for Las Vegas for several months now and we were finally able to make it there over the weekend.  Located in Treasure Island, it was easy to find.   The ONLY glitch in everything was the fact that we made a reservation at 8:00pm, and arrived at 7:45pm.  The hostess told us they were really busy and we needed to come back at 8pm.  It was said so awkwardly that we didn't feel welcome in the EMPTY bar area, so we went out into the casino again.  Hmph.  Back to 8:00pm.  We were seated and given the absolutely yummy chips and salsa, definitely plus 2 points for presentation.  Then we asked about a tequila flight and the server suggested one to us, plus 2 more points for it not being the most expensive!   We chose the organic margarita as well.  The tequila flight was pretty good and a fun experience.  We ended up pouring one into our margaritas.  Our meal was delicious.  I went with my usual black bean burrito and they nailed it (although, how hard, right?) and my husband went with the carne asada tacos.   Both of us left drunk and satisfied!

Long time reader of Cibo reviews, first time diner and now writer.  Our group of 4 headed there Saturday night, and were immediately charmed by the atmosphere with the cute patio seating and white lights.  We arrived at 7ish and got a drink at the bar (a plus - Nimbus beer from Tucson!  And a $5 glass of Pinot Grigio!)  before being seated outside in about 20 minutes.    Our waiter was super friendly and helpful, suggesting the indecisive BF order half Prosciutto Crudo and half Salsiccia.  The rest of us ordered the Margherita - I know, I know, original.  More points to the waiter, who didn't look at my friend like a weirdo when she ordered her Margherita sans the cheese. Also, there was one woman who seemed assigned to water distribution only, and was on top of refilling our glasses.  And for me, that was every 5 minutes.    We started with the Caprese Salad, which was different but oh so delicious.  The cherry tomatoes were soaked in the pesto, oregano, and olive oil and were very flavorful - great with the mozzarella.  I could've used more basil leaves or arugula, but whatev.   The pizza's were mmmmm, mmmmm good but didn't blow me away.  Again, I could've used more basil leaves, but my fellow margherita eaters took theirs off, so again, personal preference.    I would definitely return for the overall ambience and uniqueness of Cibo, as well as the friendly staff and owners.  Definitely a downtown treat!!

Yummy!  I love finding a delicious, big salad and I found the perfect one for me here - the Tomato Taza.  I got the whole size as a meal - a good amount of salad.  My 2 other girl friends liked their salads as well, and we shared the garlic and rosemary fries.  Very flavorful.  Drinks were strong - just what I needed!  The fez-tini was a little sweet for my taste, but that's just me.    Service was so so unfortunately.....especially for 5:30pm and not busy.  Oh well.....we were enjoying our chats and 'tinis.    I'll definitely be back, and maybe then I'll have the guts to introduce myself to Thomas.  :)

A-MAZ-ING!  Four of us had such a great experience here last weekend!  We called for a 7pm reservation, and upon arrival we were seated at a prime people watching spot towards the front of the restaurant.    After reading some Yelp reviews, we knew we would be ordering the Kobe burgers and adult mac and cheese sticks.  We weren't steered wrong. Yum!  And the presentation was very cute.  I tried the tomato soup, which was flavorful, creamy, and just the right temperature.  It came with two mini grilled cheese sandwiches - the perfect compliment to the soup and very filling.  For desert we ordered the donuts, which were presented on a stick with two sauces and warm.  Soooo good!    Sure, it's a little pricey but not outrageous and well worth the splurge.  Service was a little spotty with several different servers, but that was easily overlooked because of the ambiance and food.    I'll have to come back the next time I'm in town!

Wow - did my buttons get pushed on my last visit.  Our same group of 4 was really looking forward to another amazing experience....I'm pretty sure I ruined that.    I'm a vegetarian of over 20 years.  Menus and restaurant choices have come a long way since then, which allows me to find something to eat other than a salad when I go out.  Back to Fix.  We all ordered the same items....Kobe burgers, tomato soup, and adult mac and cheese sticks.  Here's where things went bad.....  I get through half of a mac and cheese stick and feel something funny in my mouth.  Something not mac-y and not cheese-y.  I pull it out of my mouth and see - gasp - MEAT!  WHAT!?!??!!  Fiance confirmed.  It's MEAT.    When the waitress came over, I asked her if there was bacon in the mac and cheese sticks.  She says "No, it's prosciutto, why?  You don't eat pork?"  I told her NO, I'm a VEGETARIAN, and the menu did not list pork as an ingredient and you did not tell me when I ordered that pork is an ingredient.  I had to pull out the piece of pork from my MOUTH before I realized it was an ingredient.  She replies with an "I know, they really should list it on the menu."  And she walks away.    Hello!??!?!?!  I was polite about it but firmly expressed that I was not happy.  No offer to get my something else, no offer to comp them, nothing.  I would have at least liked some effin' donuts.  Geez.  I just couldn't believe the any upscale restaurant in this day and age would have the audacity to not list an ingredient like MEAT.  It's so frustrating.   Okay, I'm climbing off the soapbox now.  Good night.

This is one of my favorites stores to head to when I need the motivation that comes from new triathlon clothing and accessories. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, without being intimidating.    They have a decent selection of women's items that are high quality and come with a high price - so I normally head there when I'm looking for race wear/accessories and go elsewhere for regular workout clothes.   They do have some sale items, and recently I found some great Pearl Izumi tri shorts for half off - woo hoo!   It's great to have stores like this geared towards triathlons!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Went here for a late lunch, and was surprised how busy it was for almost 2:00pm.  The two of us were able to be seated right away, and received super fast service.  The hummus is delicious, although they give you a huge plate of hummus and only 1 pita with the small order....I could've used a couple more, but whatev.  The greek salad I had was the perfect size and delicious.  Just what I want in a light lunch!    Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots, or dinner spots when I'm not eating pizza.  :)

Finally got a chance to try this place on Sunday night!  Like everyone says parking is difficult, but it wasn't too bad the night we went despite the 20 minute wait we had for a table.    First off, we were seated and Maya took our drink orders....big plus for the boyfriend was the Red Rocket seasonal beer on tap....but then we waited, and waited, and waited to order.  Not a big deal, we are patient people.  We finally order the Caesar salad, Margarita pizza, the one with pepporoni (see how much of a vegetarian I am? Can't even spell pepporoni) and sausage.  We got the Ceasar salad with the dressing on the side, and were not impressed.  It was basically an $8 plate of lettuce with a tiny bit of cheese and maybe 8 croutons.  Boooooo.  I guess that's what I get for trying to be healthy.  The pizza's on the other hand were amazing!  I get the margarita where ever we go, and this one tops them all......so yummy and a good amount of basil, cheese, and sliced tomatoes.  Big enough for 2, for sure!    After the pizza we went to the grocery and got a big cookie (made at Tammie Coe? next door) and it was chewy, chocolately deliciousness.  We'll definitely be back!

Delicious choice!  Three of us headed here for dinner on Saturday night around 8:00pm, and had a short 20 minute wait.  We were greeted by a friendly, happy waitress that was on top of everything all night!  We had to try their special Caprese salad, which was served with roasted tomatoes and slightly warmed mozzarella.  The roasted tomatoes were a different taste, but it was flavorful.  We also shared the chips and quac appetizer, which came with a pimento dip and salsa.  We knew what a pimento was - but this dip didn't taste like what you would expect.  When we asked our waitress, she was able to tell us that it didn't contain any pimento but was able to list off other ingredients.  Impressive!    Getting stuffed, somehow we managed to move on to 3 pizzas - the Margarita, the Gladiator, and the vegan Mother Earth.  Yes, they are big enough for two but we just couldn't decide on what to share!  All were delicious, and my vegan sister was impressed with the Mother Earth in all it's veggie goodness.    The food was delicious, service was spot on, environment was cozy - one of my favorite restaurants!

Yes, I'm guilty.....  I love Juicy Couture terry and velour.   I love the plain ones....no logos, no crystals.   I love the J pull on the zipper and the snap pocket pants.   I love when I can find those for 30% off....which is right now.   I love that I have a dark purple zip up and pants to wear on my wedding day, while getting ready.  I don't care what anyone else says - they're super comfy and make me feel better about myself when wearing sweats around.   So there!    Oh yes, and the women here are very friendly and helpful!

Yum!  We met a couple friends at the Vig for their new Monday $5 burger and fries special - what a steal!  Add that to great happy hour specials and you've got a night out on a budget!  I started with the lemonade while everyone else had a beer, and my husband was happy to see the Dogfish 90 minute on the menu.   For dinner, I went with the greek salad with a side of sweet potato fries (of course!).  The greek salad was huge and came with some pita bread, so this was definitely a great choice for an entree.  The sweet potato fries were delicious, but I was not a fan of the yellow dipping sauce they came with.  What even was that?  No one could figure it out.  The boys loved their burgers and fries.  Definitely big portions!    Our service was so-so, but nobody seemed to mind.  It allowed us plenty of time to chat and just relax, which was nice.    I wish there were more choices like this in Chandler!  Until then, we'll definitely take the trek back to the Vig, especially when it gets cooler and we can take advantage of the patio.

Ugh I can't stand this place. The only reason it gets two stars is because I can walk there and it's an okay place to day drink and eat some chips and salsa.  On Cinco de Mayo, they block of the parking lot and fill it with sand and then you have to wait 30 minutes to get in.  And then pay.    Friday and Saturday nights are lame-o.  Guys have to pay $5.00.  If you're in heels, forget walking in the sand.  The dance floor fills with a bunch of drunks around midnight.  The crowd is definitely not "Scottsdale", but it's something.....more like skater boy meets Affliction meets arm band tattoos.  And that's just the guys.    I've just spend a few too many nights here either with friends that actually like it or as a last resort so we can stumble home....and haven't had a good time, EVER.

Love, love, love Oregano's!!!  It's our go to place after a race, and today after the PF Chang's half marathon was no different.    We went at 2pm, and we had to WAIT!  Like, 15-20 minutes.  It was weird, but we saw a lot of fellow racers so that must be what it was.    The cheesy bread is delish, the pizza is delish, and the bellini's and pazookie's are out of this world!  And the service, wow, I have no idea how they get high school kids to act so friendly and nice!

We had another great visit at Oregano's!  Yes, there is usually a wait but we don't mind.  We put in our order for the deep dish pizza, grab a couple drinks, and enjoy ourselves.    The service, specifically the servers, are top notch.  Every single one I've come in contact with is friendly and outgoing, and it really makes a positive impression on us.  Hope to be back soon for a pizzookie!!

Yesterday, for the second time, I hiked up Siphon's Draw and today, for the second time, I can barely walk.  This is a tough one!  Like Natalie W stated, it does start out pretty easy but gets steeper and requires some tricky hand and feet placement.  There isn't a clear trail to the top and it isn't highly populated, so make sure you follow the white and blue spray painted dots.  For you Camelback hikers, it's about twice the distance - it took the bf and I about an hour and 45 minutes to get to the summit, and this is with continuous hiking with maybe a 2 minute stop for water.    The view is definitely worth it!  Make sure you take lots of water and a snack or two for the top!

Back again!  I'm so happy we have some friends that live, literally, right up against the mountain so we can park at their house and walk to the trail.    I tell ya, this is a tough one and not for your first time hiker/tourist.  Follow the blue and white spray painted dots - we saw several lost hikers.  Per usual, I'm feeling a little sore today but like I always say, no pain, no gain!  :)

We arrived at the store several months ago to create a wedding registry, which was an okay experience.  A "registry expert" sat us down and went over the basics, and then wanted to walk us through everything we may need on our list.  We weren't interested because we're already home owners and just needed some entertaining extras and a few other items.  Luckily, after awhile she got the hint and left us alone.    Anywho.  Gifts began to arrive and were shipped directly to us, big plus.  Then came the true test.....returns.  Easy as pie!  No problems!  I even wanted to exchange some items for a Kitchen Aide mixer (which every domestic woman needs!), and forgot my 20% off coupon.  Oops.  Luckily, the cashier found one and let me use it - which saved me $80 bucks.    Everyone I encountered was helpful, the only downside is that it's a little unorganized and seems crowded with merchandise.  Anytime I am in need of a kitchen items, I'll grab my 20% off coupon and return!

Oh Costco - how I dread going to thee on a Sunday afternoon.  Those big carts + samples + families shopping with their children = me wanting to run your customers and their little children's toes over!  But, alas, it's not your fault entirely....so therefore, I like you quite a bit.  Enough to shop on a Sunday afternoon.    See, I don't eat a large variety of foods, so the things I do eat, I eat almost every day.  Like most things Kashi - Waffles (they're baaack!), Go Lean and Rolls bars are all available in bulk.  And then there's my raisins and peanuts and Skinny Cow icecream bars.  Oh!  And Jarlesburg light swiss cheese!  I like that they have healthy items.  Despite it always being packed on Sundays, the long lines aren't really that long and the employees are friendly for having to deal with all those people.  Me likey.  Oh!  And that pizza and frozen yogurt!  Yum!  P.S. - If you're one of those people that leaves your cart next to your car or shoved up on the curb.....stop it.  It makes you look lazy.

My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.  After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.    We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!  I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.  How disappointing.

I'm just getting into triathlons, and have been putting off buying a road bike for quite some time.  I'm scared of road bikes.  Those skinny tires, 2000 parts, having my shoes stuck to my pedals, fancy shorts with padding....all that intimidates me.  BUT, yesterday, I decided it was time to get over it and buy a road bike.  So off I went.....  First stop, Landis.  I was not impressed with how I was treated AT ALL.  See review.   But then.......I stumbled upon Performance Bike.  I entered, began looking around, and soon after Jana came over to ask if I needed help.  I let her know I was in desperate need of a road bike that's women specific and around $900.  She showed me a couple, and then......a gorgeous Fuji that was on sale for $899 from $1539.  Woo hoo!  She sold me on it, and then helped me find accessories.  She was patient with all my beginner questions and shared my enthusiasm in starting out road biking.    Jana then took the bike and installed my clip pedals and water bottle holder....even walked me out to my car, showed me how to take off the front tire, and helped me load it up.    I had a great experience, not at all intimidated, and look forward to coming back for more accessories and service.  Now, I just need to get up the courage to head out on some rides!  :)

I have been back many times for maintenance, a fit, clothing, spare tubes, gels, etc. and have had a great experience every time!  The owner  (or manager, not sure) will go out of his way to make sure each customer is satisfied.    Love them!!

This used to be my salon of choice until I began spending more time in Chandler and decided it was time to go elsewhere.  My best friend gets her cut and color done there now, and loves it - see Janelle!  I used to just get a haircut, but always had an enjoyable experience...and recommend it to friend's new to town and looking for a hair stylist.    To be honest, one of my favorite things about getting my hair done there was people watching and checking out what all the stylists are wearing.....they are always trendy and cute.   Prices are average - $60 for a hair cut.

When I was asked to help out and take one of my favorite little kids to a birthday party here, I wasn't exactly jumping with excitement.  Upon arrival, we were greeted and asked to sign the waiver and put our present in the designated bin.  Easy enough.  Then our group of 10 4- and 5-year olds headed into the first bounce area.  The children took off to play, with fun music blaring.  Umm....dare I admit I wish I had socks so I could go play too?  A staff member told me they recently had held a 40th birthday party there - interesting!  After a half hour or so they moved into a second bounce area for another half hour, followed by some games lead by the staff there.  Both spaces were different enough to keep the children engage.  There were also a couple benches for parents that want to sit and relax.    We then moved into a party room for pizza and cake.  The room was pretty large, appropriately decorated, and had big windows.  I think the birthday boy loved the big chair and all the attention!    As an expecting parent and practically a professional babysitter - this is definitely a place you want your child to go for a birthday party!  He'll be half dead and ready for an early bedtime, that's for sure!

Four of us went Saturday evening, and I was excited to find several open tables inside and little wait to order.  It's a really neat building with a great story, appealing to my love of things local, natural, and organic.  Although....however natural my grilled cheese and french fries were, I'm sure they weren't healthy!  Definitely delicious with the texas toast, and a chocolate shake to top it off!  The boyfriend enjoyed the BBQ Bacon Blue Burger and garlic fries, although I had to stay away from him after that because those were stroooong!    I'm not sure it's a good place to go on a date, since yes, there were plenty of kids around and this was just a Saturday evening.  In fact, several were playing in the ditch as we went to leave.  I can only imagine a weekend morning.  Great if you have kids since there's lots of outdoor space to run around in, not so great if you don't want to hear it.    Overall, a unique and pleasant addition to Gilbert!

I'm a huge fan of coffee at all times of the day - but you'll never catch me drinking Starbucks (yuck!).  This location in the Promenade shopping area has a cute little patio out back with plenty of chairs and couches, as well as a good amount of room inside.  A great place to relax with a book or take advantage of their free wi-fi.    Only downsides are that they stop brewing flavored coffee in the afternoon, and it can smell like cig smoke on the patio - must be all those retail employees on their smoke breaks?

Gorgeous setting, friendly people, and the best specialty drinks I've ever had!  No syrups, no added sugar...just liquor deliciousness!  Oh, and the appetizers looked pretty good too!

Stax pleased this vegetarian - which isn't easy to do!  We stopped by on a Saturday evening and because it wasn't busy we were able to get a great spot on the patio.    Our server was helpful and knowledgeable on the menu, which I appreciate.  We started with the hummus served with pita bread and veggies - delicious, with a touch of spiciness rather than strongly garlic.  In addition we ordered the brushetta - mmmm, mmmm good!  I prefer a good amount of balsamic, and this delivered.  On to the entrees - burgers for everyone else and a salad and the Mac and Jack for me.  The salad's are huge, fresh, colorful.  The Mac and Jack was creamy, crunchy on top, and the perfect size.  All this food definitely left us full and satisfied.  My only complaint was that because it wasn't busy, our food came out very fast and I felt the timing was off. We ordered 2 appetizers and drinks (for 4 of us!) and received our entree's before we were even close to done with the appetizers.  I just wanted to enjoy the experience/restaurant/nice weather a little bit longer!  No biggie.  Will definitely be back!

First stop for the bachelorette party!  We made reservations, but they weren't needed since the place was pretty dead at 8pm.  Our group of 7 started off with margaritas, and I always love when they aren't full of sweet and sour mix.  When we wanted a round of tequila shots, the waitress recommended one no one had heard of and it was gooood stuff!  Even the tequila shot virgin enjoyed it!    I'm not sure what everyone else thought, but my bean and cheese burrito was good - complete with my favorite black beans!  Service was great for our large group, and even though I wanted a refill on the chips and salsa I certainly didn't NEED one so I can't complain.    Next time, I definitely want to do a tequila flight!

Oh how I love Jose and his tailor skills!  A friend recommended this place to me when I had to get one of many bridesmaides dresses altered.  It's back in an older strip mall, by Active Body, and upstairs but once you find it you won't go anywhere else.  He's a quiet, sweet man who knows his stuff.....and will get it done quickly.

Wow!  I spotted these large, gorgeous cupcakes from a mile away at the Yelp event and just knew I had to grab one before I left.  The presentation was amazing, with 4 different flavors available and plenty of staff to keep things stocked.    At 8:45pm they still had plenty to go around, so I happily grabbed a chocolate.  Too stuffed to eat it even when I got home, I stored it in the fridge til later.  Tonight, 24 hours later, I got it out of the fridge and it was soooo delicious.  And the creamy chocolatey filling?  What a surprise!  It was tough to eat, but once I got a plate and a fork and stopped trying to wrap my mouth around it I was happy as can be.    I'll definitely be giving these as gifts sometime soon!

First I must disclose that I'm coming from a vegetarian stand point, and would have never chosen this restaurant if it was up to me.  This night, it wasn't up to me so I joined a group of 6 on a Friday night around 7pm.  It was packed and we had about a 20 minute wait.  We were sat with 2 strangers at the community table, which seemed kind of awkward.  As a vegetarian, I saw one large slab of grill? skillet? and could only think of meat juices touching my noodles.  Sure, I get it, my grilled cheese at another restaurant may be made on the same surface as a burger....but at least I don't have to see it!    Anywho, my edamame and noodles were tasty for what they were.  The service was pretty attentive and the cook was somewhat engaging (could've been better).    Overall, it just wasn't my cup of tea.

Always a good time!  And, FINALLY, we received tech tees instead of plain old cotton t-shirts.  The expo has a lot going on, and is always packed.  One thing:  The expo should either be for runners only or not allow double strollers.  Seriously!    We took the shuttle from the finish line to the start with no problems.  Several others told us they've had to wait for 30 mins at other races, so I think we lucked out!  The course is pretty flat with a lot of spectators and a lot of runners, but the corral system works pretty well.  The finish line is well stocked with volunteers, food, and water.  Definitely a fun race!

The first time I checked this place out, I was slighty confused about the menu and pizza choices.  Not your typical pizza/wine bar menu (turns out to be a good thing!).  We came at a busy time, and I feel like the wait staff didn't take the time to explain the menu to us.  We ended up ordering the thicker pizza, which was pretty good.    The several times after that we tried a few different items, and loved them!  The Rustica is perfect for one, thin and cheesy.  I also love the Caesar Salad served in a pizza dough bowl....yummy!  On the last visit we tried the Mac and Cheese, which was thick, full of chedder flavor, and just crisp enough on top.  Definitely enough to share!  The wine list is pretty extensive, but too pricey by the glass.  The Pinot Grigio I had was $8.00 and nothing special.  It's also disappointing that the happy hour is half off bottles, rather than the glass.    The service is definitely slower than average, which was okay.  And if you go on a busy Saturday night, the place gets very, very loud.   Luckily, the pizza makes up for it!

We had a really good experience here!  We wanted to try a new, local place and because we drive by here frequently, it was time to give it a try.    After checking out the website and menu ahead of time, we decided there that were lots of food we wanted to try with prices not being so cheap.  Therefore, happy hour on a Saturday from 2-6pm seemed like a great idea.  And it was.    Tapas were 2 dollars off, so we tried the Spinach Artichoke and Caprese.  Caprese was definitely above average for me, and the dip was good as well.  Alrighty.  On to main courses.  I had to order the Mac and Cheese with a side salad, if only because the boyfriend wanted to try it.  Side salad again was more than I expected with dark lettuce, cucumbers, and tomatoes.  The Mac and Cheese was crispy on the top, yum, but we had to ask for salt and pepper to flavor it.  The boyfriend had the Grilled Chicken sandwich, which he says was very tasty.  I had to sneak a couple fries from his plate....they were crispy deliciousness.    Wow, we had a lot of food!  Plenty to take home!  But for all that plus 2 glasses of wine and a big beer it was only $51.00 with tax!  We'll be back for happy hour, and this time will stick to the tapas and drinks.

We stopped here for happy hour after some shopping on a Friday, and had a really good experience.  Maria Maria is a large, open place with beautiful decor.  Upon sitting down we received the chips and 3 salsa, which I really liked despite the chips being a little greasy.   When we asked about happy hour specials, we were told they were only available at the (small) bar.....but Tom made an exception for us at our table and even brought us a happy hour menu - definitely a plus and we didn't even have to throw in a wink, wink.    Our 2 happy hour margaritas were great - strong and not too sweet and soury.  We ended up ordering the Carnitas Quesadillas, minus the carnitas (yes, weirdo vegetarian here) and I didn't even get a strange look.  Instead of refried beans, they use black beans, which makes me sooooo very happy.  They were yummy, with the perfect amount of beans and cheese with sourcream drizzled on top.  The menu seemed to have a lot of items and specific vegetarian choices, so I'll definitely be back!

Despite the so so reviews, the bf and I decided to head here for dinner on Sunday night because it's not a chain and it's only a couple of miles away.  We were pleasantly surprised!  Starting off with the Mediterranean salad, I stated that we would be splitting it, and was pleased to see the salad brought out on two separate plates - without the charge!  Ingredients were fresh and the dressing was light.  I also had the cheese pizza, which was big enough for 2 and delicious.    Overall, the service was the right amount of attentive and friendly, the menu was huge, and we look forward to coming back!

The other day at 11:30am I got a call at work informing me my car has a flat tire.  Bummer!  After I convinced a manly coworker to come out and help me change it, I was off to the Discount Tire closest to my house.    I didn't make an appointment, had a quick wait in line at 1pm, and then left my car in their hands.  Several hours l called to find out if my car was ready and what I owed.  The man I talked to let me know that the tire was unable to be fixed, but because I bought tires from them several years ago it was under warranty and I would be getting a new tire.  Total:  $31.00.  Peace of mind:  Priceless.  Another plus - my fiance had to be at work early, so he dropped me off at Discount Tire at 7:30am the next morning to wait until they opened at 8am so I could pick my car up.  When I arrived, they opened the doors earlier to help me get on my way!  Oh!  And my car was stored in the garage over night.    I will never bring my tire troubles anywhere else!

Love going here every time I visit Madison!  It's unique and cozy, especially with the fireplace in the winter.  The crowd isn't your crazy college binge drinkers, which I like even though I try to pretend I'm a coed.  My recent visit was after the homecoming football game, and like my friend Ryan E. said we were able to get a seat for 6 of us pretty quickly.  The menu looks good - but I have yet to try anything.  I do love that they make a mean coffee and Bailey's!

MMmmmm vegetarian heaven!  So many choices, I never know what to do!  This visit I tried the cilantro & jalapeno hummus, which was delicious, and the greek salad.  Always yummy!  Service is always a little slow, but I like to call it more laid back....just enjoy yourself!

Not a fan.  Spending a lot of time in Chandler, I have been trying to find some good places to shop other than the mall.  This shopping center will not be in the rotation.    It's set up a little differently, more urban-like I guess, but it's the same old shopping and restaurant chains.  Dillard's is an "anchor", but I'm never that impressed with them.  Macy's is on the way, which is slightly better I guess.  Parking is a pain.  Not an easy in, shop, out....but what strip mall is, right?  The only plus is that the stores are somewhat organized into teeny-boppers and adults, meaning that when I wanted to hit up Banana Republic, White House/Black Market, and Ann Taylor they were right next to each other.    I'd much rather shop at Dana Park Village Square, which at least has some non-chain stores and lots of easy parking.  If I want the department stores, I'll head to the mall.

Free books, free movies, free mags, free wifi, comfy chairs with foot stools, self checkout, drive thru pick up and drop off, coffee, very separate children's area...ahhh....true love.    First off, the building is gorgeous with a zen-like front outdoor sitting area complete with the sound of running water.  It's open and airy, and just a relaxing place to be.  The set up is great - children have their own area with plenty to look at and explore, while adults have their own place to study or enjoy a book in some peace and quiet.  Definitely my favorite Scottsdale library, and yes, I've been to them all.     Note:  You may want to avoid after school from around 3:30 - 6:00pm....those kiddies from across the street can get noisy, giggly, and sometimes obnoxious.

I came here as a beginner, and was a member for almost a year until I moved farther south.  The staff was very helpful, both at the front desk and out on the floor.  Someone was always walking around, and if they saw you were on a route and having trouble with your next move they would offer technique tips to help.  They are also around for safety, and are quick to correct anyone not being safe....which I liked as a beginner and learner.    The routes are a good mix for beginnners to advanced climbers, and they have a bouldering area as well.  Member's nights are great, as you don't have as many beginners and it's fun to watch the really good climbers in action.  It can get busy on weekends with birthday parties and teenagers running around, but I knew those times and tried to avoid them.    Equipment is available to rent, including shoes, and they also have a little shop with some items for sale.  I like how they've added some yoga and other classes, and have a weight room and some treadmills upstairs to use.  A great place!

Wow - I love to organize!  It just makes me feel good inside.  This store is an organizer's dream!    The staff is friendly and helpful, the store is always clean, and they usually have some sort of sale going on.  I picked up a few things for my pantry, and had a painless return when some items didn't work out.    This is definitely my go to store when I'm feeling the need to clean up my life!

This year, the Red Rock Company eliminated the Quarterman and only offered the Half Ironman distance.  Worked for me!  This was my first SOMA event, my 3rd or 4th event put on by the Red Rock Company, and my 5th triathlon this year - woot! woot!  Now, I love the SkirtChasers event they do but this one wasn't a 5-star experience.    A half ironman distance is a 1.2 mile swim, 56 mile bike ride, and 13.1 mile run.  It started at 6:30am, and my number 7 wave didn't start the swim until closer to 7am.  Therefore, when I finished around 1:00pm it was HOT!!  Some people I saw on the course were struggling.  And in the past, other event organizers made sure there were cold sponges available or at least someone with a hose offering to spray you down.  There was only one sprinkler, and the gatorade was warm.  I would think that keeping athletes cool in 89 degree weather would be a priority.    Anyway, the volunteers were great and the finish line was great and every thing else was well organized and the negatives would never discourage me from doing another event.  Oh, and the swag was great!  It just would have been a little easier if I was hosed down!

Our group of 4 wandered in on a Friday night, in an attempt to support local businesses near our house that we haven't tried yet.  It's a small place, with a handful of tables and booths, but we were seated right away.  Mason, the resident teenager, was quick to get us drinks but was unable to tell me what white wine they had available nor did he offer to check.  Oh well, I'd already had almost a bottle at happy hour anyway.    The 2 men of our group decided to share the meatball and pepperoni pizza, and immediately described it as "a fantastic voyage".  The meatballs were flattened like pepperoni, and flavorful.  I started with the greek salad, which was great but had iceberg lettuce rather than a darker variety.  I had half a Sicilian too (ya know, for weekend leftovers), which was thick and bread like.  Another one of us ordered the penne with marinara, which looked good with a side of garlic bread.  Service was great - Sara, our waitress, was very friendly and told us they were a small mom and pop restaurant and they appreciate new business.  When the Penne came out before the pizza's, she apologized and offered us a free dessert.  When we couldn't decide, she offered us two......complimentary!  The cannoli was okay, but the Zeppolis were a.maz.ing.  Small balls of dough, fried, with powdered sugary goodness.  Mmmm!    They also do delivery and takeout, and we'll definitely be back!

Is it just me or is there a lack of speciality running stores in the Valley?  Located next to a Landis Cycle store, Sole Sports is a great resource for all things running - from getting a great fit in a new pair of shoes to accessories to offering training runs.  The staff are avid runners and know their stuff, so see them in you're ready to get into running or update your gear.    They also accept your used running shoes and donate them to a good cause - plus, if your donation you get $5 or $10 dollars off a new shoe purchase!

I hate to have to do this, since I appreciated the chance to check this place out courtesy of the Yelp Ladies Appreciation Day.    The studio itself is nice and the staff were friendly and welcoming.  I received a tour and the bathrooms and studio were clean.   Now, anyone who knows me knows that I LOVE to workout.  I LOVE to sweat.  I workout for over an hour 4 times a week and longer on weekends.  I can run 12 miles no problem and do so most Sundays.  However, I'm not the strongest or most toned person in town, so I do like to try different classes to mix it up and work my muscles.    Hence my excitement when I saw the description for the GI Jane class here.   I love words like "intense workout", "burn mega-calories", and "hard core workout".  It gets me all excited inside.  And I was excited, until about 10 minutes into the class when I hadn't even started sweating yet - yet alone burning the "mega-calories".  The energy wasn't high and the pace of the class was slow.  When it ended, I felt like I needed to go to the gym and get a real workout in.  Talk about false advertising.....  I can see where those who like dance-y classes would love this place, as most of the classes seem to incorporate some form of dance.  That's where Express MiE should keep there focus - since other reviewers seem to be pleased.    Following the class, Sarah G. (just realized that was you!?!) inquired about the instructor's qualifications.  Turns out she has no fitness certifications, just a "dance background".  Exactly my point....stick to what you know.    I realize this place is just not a good fit for me and my fitness routine, but if you're looking for a more low key workout incorporating dance then this is most likely for you!

Wowsers, this stuff is good!  I love the concept of serving yourself and pay by weight!  You pick the flavor and there are plenty of toppings to choose from - healthy and not so healthy.   There are even little sample cups to try a couple flavors before committing.  Like others have said I would have liked a smaller cup choice, but then again I ended up filling the big cup pretty good so I'm guessing that's the point.  Too bad I forgot to bring my self control.   Anyway, great idea for a yogurt place - and a friend I was with stated that it's on par with Pinkberry.  Yum!

I am such a fan of Lucy.  I'm a bigger fan of Lucy at Kierland Commons in Scottsdale, which is a bummer because this one is closer to my new home in Chandler.    The store itself has a weird layout, in part because of the two entrances I think?  And the saleswoman I encountered (not the preggo one) was a little too eager for my taste.  She was really, really enthusiastic.  I did finally let her help me, and she was helpful.....but still.    Anyway, Lucy has great active wear for the avid runner (like myself) and your every day yoga gal.  Plus, if you give them your address you will get discounts from time to time!

Sauce is a place for some quick, tasty, quality food.  We ordered at the counter, went over to get our self serve drinks, then headed outside to the patio.    Within minutes I received my side green salad and was really impressed by it.  Fresh, dark greens with flavorful tomatoes and crunchy croutons.  I often order side salads at restaurants and this rates pretty high up in terms of freshness and quality.  I went with the cheese pizza as well, which was too greasy for this hard earned bod......but nothing a little napkin couldn't soak up.  Most ordered pizza, but the pasta with red sauce looked pretty good too.    Service, for what it was, was friendly and efficient as well.  Definitely one of our stand by stops for a quick meal!

Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  We had our wedding weekend at Camelback Inn, so of course we enjoyed Rita's Kitchen several times.  Their brunch options are AMAZING!  I love the made to order waffles, pancakes (they'll add M&M's!), omelets, and french toast.  There's lots of fresh fruit and unlimited orange juice and coffee.  Prices are reasonable too!  The service is super attentive, the scenery gorgeous.  They do have a pricey Sunday brunch, but we passed on that one....  I can't wait to return with my husband to reminisce and enjoy some yummy food!

A vegetarian who loves a burger joint?  Yep!    Our group of 8 (including Matthew J.) headed here after happy hour.  I must admit, I was excited because it isn't that often that a new restaurant opens in Chandler.  We went in and were seated within 20 minutes - which was great because its not that spacious inside.  Everyone seemed to love their burgers, but I can't speak on those.  I ordered a grilled cheese, which I usually do at  "American" restaurants that provide vegetarians with only salads and maybe one other choice (boo...).   But, boy oh boy was this a great grilled cheese!!  It was more liked a toasted grilled cheese, because it wasn't weighed down by butter soaked bread like some I've experienced.  I even got to pick my cheese....yummmmyyy!!  I also ordered the Caprese, which was good.  Plus - to top the night off - gelato!    It's great to have a new, hip (ish) restaurant in the area!

As for as The Gap goes, this is the best location I've been to by far!  They have all their brands - Baby through Adult, Gap Body, and even a good sized Maternity section!   I have not had success finding affordable maternity clothes, but hit the jackpot here.  Sure, the jeans are a little expensive at $70 but there are a lot of great staples and some more dressy items.  They even had a couple maternity workout tops!  On the downside, not a single staff member asked if I needed help the entire 45 minutes I was browsing and trying stuff on and browsing and trying more stuff on.  I didn't mind though, sometimes it's nice to be left alone.  Get on their email list for coupons and check this Gap out!

Alright guys, you gained a star by bringing Bell's in!  Especially since I'm a Michigan girl, with lots of midwest friends who were happy too.  The owner(s?) were friendly and personable, and our server even went as far as to help us play a joke on a late arriving friend!      I tried the vegetarian pita, and it was actually good.  I appreciate a bar with wings in it's name providing some vegetarian options.  One thing, although I LOVE the vegetarian notation, be consistent - I personally wouldn't order the cheese quesadilla because it doesn't have the notation.  It's vegetarian though, right?!?!?  No doubt, we will be back.

Well, I'm feeling a little jealous.  As a member of the Mountainside Ocotillo location, I was able to check out this location when a water line broke (or something) and they kicked us all out yesterday at the prime time of 3:30pm.    Gorgeous!  I loved the weights/weight machines area with it's openness and plenty of room.  Plus, the machines are much, much newer here.  The cardio machines were nice in themselves with the individual TV's, but the set up is weird.  The treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, etc. are lined up against a wall facing windows outside.  Personally, I like to face inside the gym to check out my fellow exercise fans rather than the boring scenery outside.     This location is a little farther for me, but if it wasn't this would be my gym of choice (until I can get a Village in the EV!).

I was assigned the task of finding a place for our team at work to go to do some training and team bonding, and of course I turned to Yelp.   After reading the reviews and checking out the website, I called and reserved tables in the "Villa Rosa" room.  Upon arrival, it was clear that this is a great room to use for such work tasks or meetings.  There are 3 tables in there that seat 4-6 people, with doors that can be closed if needed.  If you want privacy, reserve the whole room.    Of course we had to start with some donuts, and I tried my hardest to resist them for as long as possible.  Several hours later, I dug into a chocolate on chocolate (go big or go home?) and it was everything I'd hoped for.  Yum!  I also had a green tea latte that was the best I've ever tasted!    Our group stayed for lunch and everyone was happy with their choices, which were big portions for the price.  Service was fast and pleasant too.    I hope to be back to spend another work day here!

This store could get me into some trouble with my husband!  I'm definitely a workout-a-holic and have always felt that cute workout clothes will help you get out the door and in the gym lookin' good!    I checked out this Biltmore location, and upon entering I was in LOOVE!  Lots of great stuff in great colors.  I was definitely happy to see clothing not only for yoga, but for running as well.    Staff were helpful without being overbearing.  I was able to find some great crop pants and a zip up for to and from the gym.  Of course, the prices are outraaaaagous but I've found that my high quality work out clothing lasts a lot longer than anything from Target.  Plus, this work out wear will keep me looking great beyond the gym too!    Now, if only I could justify this to my husband......!

Hmmm.....I'm not sure how someone thinks everything is so fresh and new looking - because I'm not too impressed with this gym.  I will tell you though, it's never crowded!    I joined because of the pool (which I have yet to use).  The women's locker room is bare boned compared to other gyms in the area I've been to, with signs all over about not leaving your valuables unlocked.  Sounds safe, right?  I haven't used too many weight machines but the cardio ones are decent, although some seem worn down and several are usually broken at any given time.  There are hardly any group exercise classes offered, so I haven't had a chance to try those out either.    The staff is pretty friendly, and there is usually a decent selection of magazines available....so there are your two stars.  I can't imagine being a member here for long.

As someone with no children, I haven't been in many baby stores.  A friend was registered here, so I headed in to get her some gifts.  It was easy to find the registry and someone was right there to print it out for me.  The store is clearly organized, and seems to offer something for all price points.  I was able to find most of what I was looking for, and then had someone quickly help me find everything else.  What took this experience over the top was the fact that they have FREE GIFT WRAPPING!  Sure, you have to do it yourself, but still!  There are two tables with supplies like boxes, tissue paper, scissors, etc.  LOVE THAT!    I think I may have to return when I have that bun in the oven myself!

My husband loves good beer.  I like to make my husband happy and try new places.  So here we were in the late afternoon on Friday.    First off, I LOVE this space!  It's open with lots of natural light, high top tables and couches.  When I hear that everyone wants to go to a brewery, I think dark space and sports and lots granola men.  No here!  There are several big screens, and we watched Cash Cab and then Step Brothers - much better than sports in this girls opinion!  The service was great too and I loved the little bowl of snacks and the fact that you're encouraged to bring food in if you'd like.    The boys loved the sampler and finished the evening with the Mead....so I had some happy boys!  Oh!  And I liked the Yellow #1....but I'm no beer expert.    I will definitely vote to come back here and bring some pizza too!

Lululemon has luxurious, expensive workout wear and so when I'm shopping here I expect a higher level of customer service then, say, at Sports Authority.  I expect that the sales women know their product.  Anywho.  My first time in the store earlier this week was to browse and return a head band that I was assured was non slip.  As I tried it on my head on my way home, it slipped back.  Guess what?  They don't accept returns on accessories.  Not that that is clear on the receipt.  C'mon now, the tags were on and I had the receipt from a week prior.  No returns, no exchanges, despite my expression of unhappiness with the product.    Then, I found a tank top I liked and wanted to pay cash but.....credit cards only.  ONLY.  Seriously?  I get it, most of us pay by credit card, but still, it's not like I was going to write a check.  I was told it's because it's a SHOWROOM not a store like the Biltmore location.  Oh, NOW that makes sense....(not).     Two stores in the Phoenix area, two so-so experiences.  When I'm paying $125 or more for a workout outfit, I expect something a little more impressive.  I've learned my lesson, I'll stick to Lucy.

Wow, were us mid-westerners excited to see Jimmy John's here in Tempe!  It's a staple in Michigan, and for a reason.  They do it right!  I love the "Slim" options, which are plain subs without the meat ("Slim 6") or veggies for us picky ones.  I'm not sure what everyone else ordered because I was scarfing down mine...but all were happy!    Service was fast and friendly too.  Now, if only we get get some of the people chowing on burgers and fries next door at 5 Guys to come over and order a healthy sub instead!

The Living Room is my kind of place!  The dark setting, candles, open space, the vibe, the crowd.....am I still in Chandler?  Where did these people come from?    A friend and I went on Friday at around 7pm and the place was packed.  There was some confusion at the door, since there's not a "hostess stand" indicating that you are to wait to be seated.  We were seated within 15 minutes.  Immediately, we noticed the music was just a tad too loud.  I loved the mix, but yes, a tad too loud.    We started with the bruschetta, which was delicious!  Plenty as a starter for two.  I had the mixed greens salad and it was just that....mixed greens.  Kind of boring but the greens were fresh and the dressing was light.  My friend had the chicken salad sandwich and butternut squash soup, and while she raved about the soup she was less than impressed with the sandwich.    All in all, I definitely want to come back and enjoy happy hour since this is close to home for me.  What a great new addition to Chandler!

I love parks.  Especially big ones with lots of activities and a bike/run trail.  A park with a view?  Even better.    Paseo Vista Recreational Area is a great addition to Chandler and I especially love that it connects with the canal, making it easy for me to run there from my house!  Whether you want to run the dog, run the kids, or try the disc golf course....there's something for everyone!

We've been bringing our gorgeous Great Dane for several months now, and have been pretty impressed with the dog park.  The grass is still green and it's kept quite clean.  Thank you City of Chandler!  Plus, they have a clearly posted sign that children 12 and under are not allowed and I've seen the police actually enforce that law!  It's a great, much needed law since I've seen children under 8 come in and take off running through the park with their dog, only to have 5 other dogs chase after them too.  Come on parents - get a clue!!  I don't want to be held responsible if my Great Dane tramples a child that's running at high speed!

That adorable great dane of mine came down with an upper respiratory infection AGAIN and it got so bad we wanted to take him here to get the antibiotic that worked last time.  Yes, we did call at 4:30pm and were told there was nothing available (unsympathetically, might I add) and given a number for the emergency vet they recommended.    That recommended emergency vet wanted $110 for an office visit after 5pm.  I don't think so!  Yikes!  We were able to get into a different vet a half hour later for a $70 office visit after hours, and were treated sympathetically.    On a side note, this "Pet Resort" backs up to an open field and the canal, and on many early morning runs I've heard lots of unhealthy barking.....making me wonder what goes on there before staff show up for the day.  We will not be returning.

Fieldwork Phoenix is a great way to voice your opinion, try out new product, and earn some extra bucks!    It's easy.  You sign up online and then from time to time you'll receive short questionnaires via email to determine if you qualify for one of their studies.    Last week, I finally qualified!  It was a fitness study that required some homework, like documenting what I eat before/after/during a workout.  The night of the actual study, I showed up 20 minutes early (early bird drawing for $50!) to check in and fill out paperwork.   Then, the group of us were taken into a conference room where we discussed a new product (sorry, it's confidential!) and our thoughts on design and marketing.  Two hours later, it was over.  Painless!  Pay and time depends on the study, but for this particular one it paid $125 for two hours.  Not bad!  Every employee I've come in contact with, either in person or over the phone, has been friendly and able to answer all my questions.  If you're looking to make some extra money in an easy and fun way, sign up!

Mmmm the perfect choice for our carbo loading before the PF Chang's Rock n Roll race!  The service was great, especially since it was a busy Saturday night.  Our waitress was quick to come over a give us a sample of red wine, followed by the delicious bread and salad.  I tried the Capellini Checca with whole wheat, which was a departure from my favorite of cheese ravioli.  It was different like I expected it to be, with roma tomatoes and feta, but a little too oiley for my taste.    Everyone loved their entrees, and when we kept asking for more and more bread the waitress was quick and pleasant about it.  She even split our checks - 3 ways - and was sweet about that as well.    The BIG negative for me is that their salad they bring in a big bowl to the table has salami in it......booooo for me, a vegetarian.  I would have liked to have gotten a heads up or something on the menu stating the ingredients.    Other than that, delicious Italian with great service!

The first H&M in north Scottsdale was quite the disappointment, so I was happy to see that this location was a big improvement!  It's much bigger, with a better selection, and I was able to find several wardrobe staples and affordable trendy items for a great price!  I'll definitely make this one of my regular stops when looking for something new without wanting to break the bank!

As an avid runner and triathlete, and now pregnant, I've found that I can't do the workouts I've once loved the way I used to.  I've been contemplating pre natal yoga, but wasn't sure I wanted to slow down that much.  In comes Studio BFF!  I contacted Lisa prior to attending, just to make sure she could show me some modifications.  The next day, I went to the Ballerobica class.  Lisa immediately made me feel welcome and took the time to show me some of the things we'd be doing in class.  The Ballerobica class itself was great, with a good mix of easy to follow ballet and moves to tighten and tone all over.  Lisa told us she adjusts each class based on who is attending, and during some of the moves she came around and adjusted me to make sure I was getting the most out of the workout.  Don't be too intimidated if you're not a dancer!  It was a pretty tough class and I was feeling it a little the next day!    All in all, this is a simple studio that has a little something for everyone.  Plus, you can't beat their monthly unlimited rate!  I would have taken advantage, but like the option of going to classes in the morning during the week as well.  Hopefully if they keep growing that will be an option!

Yum, yum, yum!!  My vegan sister is in town, so this was a great excuse to try True Food for the first time.  I love the vibe, the open kitchen, the decor, and the abundance of fruits and vegetables for your viewing pleasure!  As a vegetarian, it's so refreshing to go to a restaurant and have lots of CHOICES!  And healthy ones at that!  I started with the Cucumber Lemonade, which was the perfect combination.  My husband got the Green Arnie (green tea and lemonade), again, delicious.  A little pricey, but that's okay.  My sister tried the Hangover Cure, which was too much coconut for me but she loved it.    We started with the hummus, and in my experience it can be a little bland but this was flavorful.  I loved the addition of tomatoes, feta, cucumber and olives.  We also ordered the Kale salad to share - and let me tell you - I would eat this everyday if I could!!!  Tasty!  For my main dish I had the Tomato and Olive Oil pizza, which was surprisingly flavorful despite being kind of boring.  I could have gone for more basil, but that's just me.  It did hit the spot though.  Others enjoyed the steak tacos and the spaghetti squash.    Let me tell you, we were all part of the "clean plate club" and had a great time trying each others dishes.  It feels so good to eat this way.  When my husband saw the initial portions, he thought he'd leave still hungry.  Come to find out - he was happily satisfied.  We'll be back for lunch in the near future!

After having a baby a few months ago and moving to the midwest where places like this don't exist, I knew I needed to try Drybar out on a recent trip back to Scottsdale.  And at $35 plus tip - it's affordable!    My hair is in the growing out stage, just past shoulder length, so I was worried that none of the styles would look as good as they do in the photos.  I was wrong - my "Cosmopolitan" turned out super cute with just the right amount of curl.  I looked done up without looking over done - just what I was going for!  I also saw they have "Floaters", which is a 10 minute head massage for $10...which might be a nice addition once in awhile.    The salon has a modern and clean look, which I love, and staff were friendly.   If I still lived in Scottsdale, I could see myself having a girl's night start here for sure!  Plus, there is plenty of shopping and dining (lululemon and True Food Kitchen!!) nearby.

Um.  I love this joint.  Seriously.  It's the vegetarian burrito for me with black beans, obv, with lots of that hot salsa!  Mmmmm!  If I eat the whole thing I'm full for a good 8 hours....and my burrito is always so tasty, that yep, I'm full for a good 8 hours.  I wish I had the self control to save half for later.    I'd give this 5 stars, but I'm kind of a health nut and we all know those white toritillas are def not healthy!

I'm in love.  Totally, completely in love with the bundt cakes here.  Especially the chocolate....which I could sit on my lap and eat with a fork for a few hours.  Mmmmmmm!  It's so rich and moist, with chocolate chips mixed in and thick cream cheese frosting.  Yummmmyyy!!  Anywho.  I was introduced to Nothing Bundt Cakes through my roommate's mother, who sent her one for her birthday.  Since then, we've ordered them for any special event or birthday.  I've been to this store in Ahwatukee and the new one in North Scottsdale.  Both stores are small but adorable, with some extras for sale like t-shirts and cards.  You can choose from the larger cakes, which you should order ahead of time, and then the small individual sizes if you want to try a new flavor or have just had a bad week.   :)  I believe they do delivery now too, to a limited area.  Very cute idea for a birthday, holiday, or special occassion!
