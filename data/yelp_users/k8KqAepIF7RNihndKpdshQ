I have been let down by this hospital many times but it being the closest to the house I had to take my grandmother there last night. I was very pleased by everyone! From the admitting staff to the doctor and more everyone was very nice and helpful. They all listened to what we had to say and we didn't leave until we had a diagnosis. (All the other times it was hurry up and get out) We will come here again if needed.

Everything was great, comfy bed, nice cool room, clean. Only thing was the noise from the freeway and shower wouldn't work but it wasn't a big deal just took a bath.

Ordered take out and they told me 15 minutes so I arrived on time but had to wait about 5 extra minutes which wasn't a big deal. I had two rolls both were fresh, they lacked a bit of flavor but nothing some soy sauce can't fix. Will be back.

Service horrid...waiting 25 minutes before a server comes by and then another 15-20 before my drink arrived. Place was not busy so there were no excuses.
