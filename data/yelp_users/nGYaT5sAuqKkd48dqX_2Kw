This a great little cigar shop with a great variety.  The owner was SUPER helpful and informative.  Prices are at or just below market pricing.   One odd thing...they do not let you touch any of the cigars. They consider it a "hygiene" issue.

LOVE THIS PLACE.  The staff are great.  The beer is INCREDIBLE.  The food....ahhhh...it is pretty good (much better than typical bar food.)  If you like IPAs...this is the place to go.  The cask IPA is a mouthful of heaven.

I love my complex. I love my townhouse. I think the HOA Board is doing an incredible job during tough times.   I LOATH my management company.   Mutual Management simply does not care nor do they respond.  I have sent multiple requests for data and assistance to Mutual Management and rarely get a timely or adequate response.  Mutual Management uses a "wait them out approach" on most issues. The customer service is non existent. Communication is horrible.  I cannot begin to outline the lack of support, care, or service that I have recieved from Jenny at Mutual Managment. Emails and messages are rarely returned. Legitimate questions go unanswered. She lacks the desire or ability to truly support the owners in our community.  Steer clear of Mutual Managements community's. You will not be satisfied as an owner.

i like it, i like it a lot! (you must say it like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber.)  We stopped in last night for dinner and cocktails.  I left quite satisfied with the experience.  The atmosphere, service, pricing, and food were all top notch.    I really LOVED the grilled artichoke...you must try this.  I am excited to check out the new facility that will be opening late this year.  It is right down the street (in the spot that Chevy's was located.)  Check it out..

This is a great animal hospital with a friendly caring staff.  It is kind of fun to visit because they have two office cats that pretty much own the place.  My dog goes nuts trying to get to them every trip.  I have been taking my Jack Russel "Jackass" to them for years....highly recommended.

Sports Pepper is a neighborhood sports bar with a variety of events weekly (poker tournaments, UFC Fights, DJs, etc.)  They offer up a full selection of spirits, a nice variety of food items, and a friendly staff.  The facility is clean and the prices are great.  My biggest gripe with Sports Pepper is that the food quality is very inconsistent.  The quality changes from night to night. Over the last several months, they are often out of items (the last few times it was the cottage cheese or buffalo shrimp.)   Last night I ordered the fajitas and a side salad. The fajitas were excellent....very very tasty.  The side salad was HORRIBLE.    You ask: "How can your ruin a side salad?"   I answer:  "Use old wilted and brown iceberg lettuce."  Really???  Were the lights out in the kitchen?  Did my server develop cataracts and not notice that nearly EVERY inch of my plate had brown wilted iceberg on it? I mean this stuff should have been thrown out LAST week.  I firmly believe the cooks are Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Dr. Jekyll does a great job in the kitchen and I am a fan of his work.   The buffalo shrimp and fajitas are AWESOME.   But man-o-man do I hate it when Mr. Hyde is working...he forgets to keep the kitchen fully stocked and he can't even make a salad!

This is a great place.  Great neighborhood dive bar with a  great Karaoke place (evil T.)  The food is better than the average bar.  The steak salad is GREAT and the breakfasts are incredible.  Facility - Average. Your average neighborhood bar. Dark  and dingy...like the locals love it.  Quality - The quality is good.  The cooks do it right.  Very consistent.  Staff - The girls at Brigett's are great.  Price / Value - Brigett's prices are very good and they offer a great bang for your buck.  If you like to spend a few hours at the local neighborhood biker bar...then this is the place for you.

Aw Aw Aw AWESOME (sorry for the stutter...but it was hard for me to express how much I love Carolina's.)   Growing up in a border town, I love my Mexican food.  This also makes me ultra critical of Mexican restaurants.....but I have nothing critical to say (which is strange coming from someone who has the tag line "always the critic.")  The food is super authentic.  The price is great.  The facility is a total DIVE which makes me love it that much more.  The kitchen is wide open so you can watch the ARMY of staff making tortillas, prepping the food, and packing it for your tasty delight.    You gotta try this place!  PS - pick up a pack of piping hot tortillas to take home.  They are the size of a manhole cover.

-----this review is being posted for Greyhound Bus Lines as an entire company------  IS GREYHOUND TARGETING THE POOR BY REQUIRING GIAGANTIC FEE INCREASES FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT BOOK THEMSELVES??  Let me start by saying that I will NEVER use Greyhound  again. Never.  I had the unfortunate experience of riding Greyhound just after graduating college.  My experience was that the facilities and buses were dirty. The facility lacked adequate security.  Now I find out that they are targeting the very people that keep them in business by charging those who most need their service HUGE service fees.  My latest experience:  It was horrible.  My sister, who is staying with me while she completes testing and assessments in consideration for a liver transplant, needed to return to Yuma immediately to provide care for another family member.  Because my sister does not have checking or lines of credit, she asked me if I could book her ride for her online.  She wanted to make sure that she had a spot reserved.  I went to Greyhound.com to arrange for a ticket and transportation for my sister.  Greyhound quoted a price of $34.32 for a one way ticket. As I completed the forms online and proceeded to checkout, the cost of the ticket had changed to $52.32.  As I researched the change further, I realized that Greyhound has a policy of charging an $18.00 fee if you buy the ticket but are not the person using the ticket.  Greyhound listed the fee as a "Gift Ticket Fee."  I contacted Greyhound customer service. Based upon my conversation and the lack of English spoken by the rep, I am assuming that Greyhound has outsourced its call center function overseas.  The CSR I spoke with explained to me that the fee is a policy of Greyhound and it is charged to cover the additional costs and for convenience.  I asked him to breakdown what additional costs they were incurring?  He was unable or unwilling to justify the fee.  He kept reiterating that "this is our policy and you must pay Gift Ticket Fee."  My feeling here is the Greyhound has instituted a policy that is direct fee on the poor and indigent.  This policy has the DIRECT EFFECT of raising rates on those who can least afford it.  In my sisters case, the cost for me to book her bus fare was an INCREDIBLE 52% INCREASE over the advertised fare.  Greyhound...it is no wonder your ridership is in continual decline.  It is no wonder that your company is on shaky financial grounds.  Wake up.  Take a look at your reviews online.  Read what people are saying about you.   Your organization used to be considered an icon in the American transportation system.  Now you are looked at with despise.

I wont use again.  They damaged a few shirts and on at least one occasion my clothes were not returned on schedule for several days because the vendor they were using switched machines.    I have left the owner a few messages with no response or return calls.  The staff was very helpful but in the end the owner was the only person that could resolve my concerns.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this cleaner.  Dry cleaning is the bane of my existence.  All of my shirts must be fitted or altered (I am an oddly shaped guy after all) which means they are an investment.  After having several issues with repeated damage at other cleaner (see my previous reviews) I heard about One Hour Martinizing.  Judy and the entire gang have done a great job on my clothes.    The price is fair.  Service and quality is excellent. They are reliable.  My clothes look great.   Most importantly....MY CLOTHES DON'T GO MISSING AND ARE NEVER RIPPED!.

Well...all good things come to an end.    After years of going to Del Rey, I have had to find a new cleaner.    I had 7 shirts come back with rips in nearly an identical spot over a 6 week period.  At first I thought this was due to wear.  The rips were in the area of my right elbow.  However, after about the 3 rip and closer inspection, they appeared to be slits.   I had three shirts come back with slits in elbow in early March over a two week period.   I realized we had a problem as these shirts were relatively  new and had been worn just a few times...including one that only had been worn just once.  I mentioned the issue to the rep at the front desk and he was clear...it wasn't anything that they did.  I started getting my cleaning done at a more expensive competitor and poof...no more rips.

"I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear, They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony. I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues. Oh yes, them Blues." (WC Handy - Memphis Blues.)  Great blues bar.  Dark and dingy place with new blues bands daily.  Super diverse patronage.  Fun place to hang and listen to them blues...Oh yes, them Blues.

OK...the Yelp reviews drew me in for a try...like a mouse to cheese.  So it was no surprise when I arrived to find this place in a pretty poor facility...I can deal with this. No problem. I love dives, mom and pop shops, local back alley eateries, tacos stands in Mexico.....mystery meat and all...I live for this stuff.   However, I was surprised with a few things: To start...GET  A DUMPSTER WITH A LID.  The entire parking lot smells of  rotten garbage.  Unappetizing, unsanitary, and disgusting.  2nd...put some fresh paint in this place and clean the bathrooms already.  The walls and ceilings looked to be painted sometime during the Ming Dynasty.  The sink and soap dispenser were caked with what looked liked decades of residue.  I felt that washing my hands might actually make them dirtier.  Ok...now for the good stuff.   1) The staff was incredible.  I have NO experience with Vietnamese food which a majority of the menu consists of.  The waitress (and I am assuming owner) stopped and spent significant time with Ash and I.  She recommend a variety of dishes based upon our tastes.   2) The value was excellent.  The price point is under the $10 mark and the portions were large. 3) The quality of the food was excellent.  The egg rolls, spring rolls, noodle dishes, and meats were tasty.  In the end...I don't think I will be back.  While the food was great and the staff was wonderful...the facility was too much for me.

Cheesy, beefy, greasy GREATNESS.     The burgers are made as you watch..  Sit at the bar and watch the grill cook (who also is the server, bartender, and cashier)  grab a nice fat ball of ground and pound it out on the grill to make your one of a kind patty.  NEXT comes the wine onto the grill and the patty... which gives the place it's name.  Finish it off with a fat layers of veggis.  Pair this with some jalapeno bottle caps and a pint of draft, and your in BUSINESS!!!  Don't mind the dingy early 70s decor....it is character.  The only negative...you will be jogging for weeks to drop those calories...a very guilty pleasure.

Great little sushi spot with a heck of an all-u-can eat deal.  I like it.  The staff is great, the food is great quality and the prices are fair.  My only complaint: Nearly every time I leave Sushi Q I get hit up by the pan handlers working the liquor store next door.  4 stars for price, quality, and staff.

I just received an email from the owner of Santisi Brothers.  I love this personal touch of service and greatly appreciate a business owner taking the time to address a concern I have.  While it is not always easy to relay an issue at an establishment, Yelp has been a great tool to get across any frustrations.  John Santisi wrote to me today thanking me for my business and Since Santisi Brother has numerous exits, they have had a significant problem with walk outs.  In short, people have taken advantage of the business.    I don't like have to leave a credit card prior to ordering, but I understand the issue and believe that it is a legitimate way to control losses.  Plus, if it keeps prices down...then no worries.  Long story short...still love Santisi Brothers and will return often.  When asked for my credit card up while ordering... i will hand it over with an understanding smile.

Chuck and his team has been my tax accountant for about the last 4 years.  I have worked with several other accountants and the CW Clarke team has CONSISTENTLY out performed my wildest expectations.    Each year he has worked with us early to discuss and to develop a tax strategy and to help us understand the realities of the ever changing landscape of the US tax system.  He approaches his clients needs aggressively but ethically.  Chuck does great work and a very fair price.

WOW.  Talk about one impressive outfit.  I have NEVER had a smoother car buying experience.......NEVER!    What stuck out was that I did not have to go through the ENDLESS negotiations.  I told them what I wanted to do...and they made it happen.  After stalking the new 4Runners for several years and pricing them out with several dealerships, I thought I would take another look to see if I could make the numbers work.    I was looking for a VERY aggressive deal that would allow me to have a similar payment on the 2011 SR5 4Runner with the luxury package as I had on the 2007 Tacoma.  I was referred to Thomas Gonzalez, Fleet Director, by a friend.  I reached out to Thomas via phone and explained exactly what I wanted to do.    I negotiated with Thomas for less than 15 minutes via phone.  The deal was perfect that he put together.  I expected the deal to be "revised" or changed when he handed me off to Dennis Montoya, Fleet Manager.  Dennis could not have been a better guy.  Everything was so smooth, ethical, and professional that I cannot speak HIGHLY enough about the fleet team at Big Two.  Long story short (or long depending on your attention span)....my experience was excellent.  My total time to purchase from walking in the door to driving out in my COOL new 4Runner was just under an hour....awesome.  A quick note...I bought and serviced my last two Toyota's at Camelback....and I am not sure I will be back.  The team at Big Two absolutely knocked it out of the park.  Thanks guys for a painless auto buying experience!

Poor follow up and non-responsive.  I met with Brian at Imagine Architectural on 9/2/2015 to review some pool deck repair work we and some deck expansions we needed as part of our overall backyard remodel.  The meeting went really well and I was impressed with his recommendations. We agreed that he would send two quotes for services.  The first being for a Acrylic overlay and the second being for Travertine pavers.    I received the first quote back on 9/4.  The original quote did not include the Travertine pricing.  I sent a follow up emails to Brian, Meghan, and Pete twice on 9/8 with no response.  I followed up again on 9/10 and did get a response from Brian that he was a bit behind and that he would get "an expedited revision on Travertine to me asap."  I again followed up on 9/18.  I still have not heard back from the Imagine Architectural Concrete team.  I guess my backyard remodel project just wasn't big enough for them. Time to move on!   **Just received the response from the owner of the Imagine Team.    Here is an overview of the communication from the Imagine team.

Finally got to check out S. Francis earlier this week.  I had the Salmon Salad...it was awesome.  Sleek and modern.  Trendy and hip.  Not pretentious.  Excellent quality.  Great service.  Value...well it was slightly overpriced.  Overall I would come back.  My only complaint was the sliver of a menu.  St. Francis only offered a handful of choices. It is in fact probably the smallest menu I have ever come across.

Feeling adventurous, we grabbed some Kirin and headed down to Hana. 1) We started with the Green Lip Mussels.  INCREDIBLE...best I have ever had. No exaggeration. They were GREAT. 2) Next we tried the Lobster Roll Special.  Awesome.  A huge roll with a giant piece of lobster on each piece. 3) Moving on to the Dynamite Roll...OMG (you have to say it like a 16 year when she gets the keys to daddy's BMW.)  This was the highlight.  It hardly qualifies as Sushi.  A giant steaming pile of crab, scallops, cheese, and sauces over some type of roll.  Wow.  Our server was EXCELLENT when he was around.  He spent  a considerable amount of time explaining several of the specials. He was one of the most knowledgeable servers I have ever had.  To be honest, the only negative of our experience was that he only stopped by our table three times in just over an hour...ouch.  If it weren't for having to flag him down to order or get our check, I would have given Hana 5 Stars.  I love the fact that they are BYOB.  This is a huge plus.  Give this place a shot. I will definitely be back...many times.  GREAT FIND.

I LOVE THIS PLACE.   Make reservations or call and get your name on the list at least one hour early....the wait is often 1-2 hours.  Yes it is a chain.  WHO CARES.  The quality is always top notch.  The service is great.  The fish is ultra super fresh 10,000 (if you end anything with 10,000 it means it is the best.)  Most fish are flown in only in season.  Right now you can get a lb of crawfish or a dozen oysters on the half shell for $3.95 (Wednesday nights it he best because fresh shell fish come in that morning.)  PS- Awesome and economic happy hour.

I went there this last Monday for happy hour and dinner:   Most of my experience was positive....until the end. We did have a few small service issues, most of which are typical of a fairly new staff in training.  However, we did have a big problem regarding our bill at the end.  During our meal on 8/31/2009 (dinner time), the manager came by and asked how everything was going, we let him know that it was great but to please send by our waitress as we hadn't seen her in awhile.   When we received our bill, we were pleasantly surprised to see a few items comped to a 0 dollar charge.  I grabbed my card and gave it to the waitress to pay the tab of approximately $14.50. I was quite surprised when she returned the card and receipt (which had now been charged to my card) for more than $36.00 without even mentioning it to us.  She had also removed the original receipt and put a new one for the correct amount.  I asked to see the manager, who came buy to discuss this with us.  Here is a quick breakdown of the conversation:  Question from manager: Did we eat the items?  Answer from me: Of course we did...the issue wasn't that we were paying for them, it is that your staff substituted the receipt for a different one, charged us more than double what I authorized, and didn't notify us.  How can you do this without at least letting us know that you changed the amount?  Answer from manager: Well I am hearing a different story from her...she indicates that she told you.  Plus we have already given you a good break on the prices of your drinks.  Response from me: First off,  don't take it from me....ask the 3 other people at the table.   Secondly, it was happy hour...these were your advertised prices.  How is it that you gave me a "break" on your prices?  Response from the manager: Look, what is it that you want from me?  You ate the food, it was a computer mistake....can I have your business card?  Response from me: My business card, what does my job have to do with this?  Answer from manager:  It looks like you just left from working in a restaurant by the way you are dressed?    At this point...I signed the receipt and left.  Zero tip of course (sorry to be an jerk...but I was not happy.)  To be honest, I don't remember ever being more frustrated with someone before.  I really wasn't expecting a free ride or meal, but an apology and explanation of HOW you can replace the original receipt with a new one for more than twice the original amount and charge it would have sufficed.

I was pleasantly surprised.   The server was incredible.  It was a GREAT value.  We enjoyed our meals. Loved the environment sitting on the patio.  I had the Lasagna and Ash had the Seafood Manicotti.  The Lasagna was great.  I really enjoyed it.  It had a great texture, perfect amount of cheese, and was well seasoned.  The Seafood Manicotti was incredible.  I HIGHLY recommend this dish.  Along with dinner we each enjoyed a wine flight.  They offered a nice selection and we both really enjoyed the tasting.  I would highly recommend this spot.  Give it a try.  We will be back.  For the $$...you cannot go wrong.

E  I  E  I  O  I loved the Farm Kitchen (at S. Mountain.)  This place is a little paradise....a piece of small town USA.  The farm at South Mountain in great place to bring family, friends, out-of-towners, and it is incredible for kids.  The entire facility is open and you can roam the place freely while checking out the farm and lots of chickens.  We were bummed that the wait for the breakfast place was over an hour.  Someone told us to check out The Farm Kitchen.  We were very glad we did.   This quaint little cottage offered a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, and baked goods.  Most of the items included products groan on-site.  We ordered a few sandwiches, the pasta salad, and the mushroom soup.  We were not disappointed....everything was great.    The food was high quality.  The sandwiches were huge. The service....well no service to review since the place was an order and pick up at the counter style sandwich joint. The prices were a little high.  I would say the average lunch will run $12-$15 per person if you get a drink and side.  The price  was worth it to me to get out of the house and spend a few hours in place that really takes you away from the city.

I will keep this one short.  Value: Great. (lots of food for the moo la...wait is that how you spell it?) Atmosphere: Ummm...interesting place.  But cheaply put together. Quality: Ho hum. The food was fine...but nothing special.  Very plain. Service: Well not much in the way of service...order and the window and get out of the way.  Not my favorite but worth the visit.

ME:    Of course I want to go to an Asian Topless bar.  Are you feeling ok Ash...I thought you hated topless bars?  AND ASIAN NONETHELESS....I never expected that from you!  ASH:    Shut up...I said Asian TAPAS Bar! Not TOPLESS.  ME: Damn!  Darn my luck...a guy never gets to have any fun!!!   It wasn't what I expected...but I was not disappointed.  It was great.  The place was hip.  The staff was friendly.  The food was incredible.  The bill...well the bill was a bit high.  But overall it was a great experience.    We started snapping pics through dinner.  This motivated the Exec Chef and Owner lady to come sit next to us at the bar.  I felt kind of bad for drawing attention because the owner lady became very controlling with the staff and I was a bit uncomfortable for them.  But overall...I would say this place is aw aw awesome.  Try it. Have a cocktail.  Eat some Tapas. Have some fun. Don't expect anyone to be topless though :-(

The quality was great and prices were good.  I will be back...probably many times.  Also, the patio is dog friendly.  We got to check out the coolest miniature bull terrier.

So I visited Cherubini again today.  They kind of goofed my order.  After about 10-15 minutes I went up to check on my order.  All the staff were standing around chatting and no one was in the kitchen.....ummm.    The cashier's jaw dropped when he realized I was still waiting for my order.  Evidently the order didn't print in the kitchen so my sandwich had not yet been made.  He brought my food out about 5 minutes later with a receipt showing my credit card charge was reversed.  Lunch was on the house because of the mistake. Awesome.  I REALLY like this place and greatly appreciate that level of customer service.    To error is human...to comp my lunch DIVINE!

Great little spot.  Beer is high quality.  The staff very friendly and they provided very personal service.  I got a chance to chat with the owner for 30 minutes or so.  What a nice guy.  Beware...they only offer a few food items (hot dogs and ball park nachos.)  This is not a dinner spot...it is a drinking spot.  Gotta love the Ridgeback IPA.  A whopping 10% and a mouthful of hops in every sip.    You gotta go check it out.

I liked it.  Go check it out...  Let me tell you what I liked about it: -Food was good quality and yummy. -Beer and wine selection was above par and had some great choices. -They introduced me a great new Imperial IPA called Oskar Blues 'Gordon.' -The artichoke cheese dip was AWESOME (I highly recommend you try this.) -Environment this place is cute and fun.  We sat at the communal table (about 12 feet long) and enjoyed our first trip.  Areas for improvement: -The menu was SMALL (only a handful of choices in each category - appetizers, sandwiches, salads.) -The side salad was....um...lettuce and nothing more.  Overall...I will be going back...soon.

Stopped in The Lounge after attending the Dinner for Breakfast event at Scramble.  IT WAS DEAD.  Evidently, they haven't had the grand opening yet...just finished everything out and are working out the kinks.    This is a GREAT little place.  Very swanky and hip.  Well designed with a good variety of high end liquors.  Ultra sleek interior with white leather lounge chairs.  They even have Peroni on tap.  I would however say if you are a beer lover...THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE.  I only saw three or four different beers available.  The menu looked great but we did not try anything.  The bar tender was AWESOME.  Strong pours.  Very friendly.  Great Attention to us.  We really liked the place and I hope that they do well.  I can see this being a great happy hour or end of the night stop off.  I would recommend you give it shot.

Stopped in again last night after dinner at Il Posto.  Still love it.  The new bartender, Russel, is great.  Russel offer some very personal service and took good care of us.  Good spot..check it out.

The team at InHouse Techies is great.  They handled a number of IT projects for our company and we are proud to be partnered with them.

Great shop.  The staff and ownership was very knowledgeable and really helped me to narrow down my search.    I found the pricing to be more than competitive and they had a few items in stock that are nearly impossible to find in town (380 acp and 9mm.)  Definitely will work with the DM team again.

I LIKE IT!    What's not to like: Taco plates and $6.00 small craft beer pitchers!
