Tony did an AMAZING job on the flowers for a wedding this past weekend. Always so fresh and beautiful, they never disappoint! He has some of the most unique and beautiful arrangements I have seen! Would recommend anyone to him that is looking for good quality, gorgeous flowers!

If you're out looking for a bite to eat and want good authentic tacos, this is not the place to go. We ordered the shredded beef (crunchy) tacos, chips and salsa & a mango beergarita. The tacos came out and the shells are store bought shells, the beef was ICE cold & the frozen margarita tasted like pure syrup with no tequila hint or flavor what so ever (thank goodness we got the beer!). The chips and salsa were very good though! I think this place is more hip to the college kids. The atmosphere was cool and relaxed, but the food was just gross. Save yourself time and a few bucks and just hit up taco bell or a Rubios.

Adore Bridal has some of the most beautiful dresses I have seen! The owner is always on top of her game and will make sure she finds the perfect dress for you! I like that they aren't all corporate and just about making a sale, but they are about the bride, making it a memorable experience and focusing on you to make you feel like a princess! I will always recommend any of my gf's who get engaged to check out Adore Bridal!
