I have been here 4 different times. The first time I went I thought it was a decent place which is why I returned. Each visit after the first proved to be worse than the time before. The last time I went, which was about a month ago, my roommate and I went to celebrate her birthday with a drink. The bartender completely ignored us for the first almost 10 minutes we were there. She made eye contact with us when we walked in and just resumed her conversation with the person she was talking to (the said person was not ordering anything). Finally after waiting she did come over and take our order.  The temperature in the bar was really uncomfortably warm, especially for it being Phoenix in May. The bathrooms are sooo tiny and claustrophobically small and they don't have real doors on the stalls. I honestly can say I will not be returning to this place...

Food - WAY OVER PRICED and not as good as you would expect with the prices. We ordered an appetizer sampler. The brought us potato skins that were still frozen in the middle, we asked for them to take them back and they did and when they brought them back they were burnt. My friend ordered a steak and asked that it be done Medium Well and when it came it was so rare it was practically mooing.   Drinks - Decent but nothing to rave about.   Service - Poor. Our wait staff was over whelmed by their section and was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. I understand that environments like that can cause this but I have seen worse and he should have been able to handle it. The management that came and talked to us was rude and a bit snarky. We were spending over $130 in the establishment and he acted as though we were an inconvenience since we were not happy with the appetizer or one of the drinks we had ordered. When my friend explained that her steak was not cooked enough he did offer to take it back and have it recooked but by that time that had taken place she had lost her appetite.  Atmosphere - Best part of the experience.  After being spoken to the way the manager spoke to us I can safely say I will NEVER return to this Claim Jumper. For the amount of money we spent that night I would have at least expected some common courtesy.

Both myself and my daughter have been seen here and I have to say each time I have been there I have been pretty much satisfied all the way around. The only thing that really bothered me about this location is the wait time which is why they did not get 5 stars from me. Every time I have been there I find myself waiting... And waiting... And waiting... I really like the staff, the manager of the place is very friendly and professional and the really tall gentleman (forgive me I can't remember his name) really impressed me. The doctor is friendly and quick (in fact once they called me back for the exam it went smooth and quick). I loved the frames selection and they worked really well with my daughter who has special needs. I definitely will be returning here both for myself and my daughter. And I won't mind sending a referral their way a time or two either. Would be nice if they worked on that whole waiting thing though!

I am a big fan of Bookmans! Since being pointed in their direction a few months ago I have been there multiple times. I have been very pleased with their selection each and every time I go in there. I have bought multiple birthday gifts there because they have exactly what I am looking for. My 8 year old daughter and I love their children's selections and I found some old childhood favorites of mine that I can now pass along to my daughter.  The musical instrument section is also a big plus for me since we are musicians. It's not a very big selection but it is decent and the prices are not bad. I wish the music (CD's and Vinyls) section had a bigger selection but that is my personal preference and I realize they are a book store.   The staff is always friendly and helpful. However, sometimes they are hard to find in the store. All in all I love this place and will continue to shop there!

Not quite sure why the reviews are so low for this Fry's. I love shopping here! I have been going regularly since moving into the neighborhood over a year ago. The staff are friendly, never once have I seen a sourpuss on staff. The store is always clean and easy to maneuver. I love the prices and the ease of shopping here!

Here's the deal, I have eaten there a couple of times and each time I have hopes that it will be better than the last time. It never gets worse but it really never gets better either. The food is not authentic like they like to advertise and when I first moved to AZ I had such high hopes. To this day I tend to make better mexican food then I can find out in Phoenix. And seriously, no chicken ALL day? What was up with that. The staff is NOT friendly at all and have the look of drones on their faces.

So Bar 1 holds a special place in my heart! I wished I lived closer since this would be a regular place I would frequent. The only reason Bar 1 has not received 5 stars is because their bathroom is horribly small but I do appreciate how cute it is. The bar service was great and the prices were even better. Although this bar is considered a gay bar I love how inclusive it is everyone. I have had bad experiences in the past but Bar 1 surpassed my expectations. The atmosphere is fantastic and welcoming. I thoroughly enjoyed both the inside and the outside areas. The pool tables were not over crowded for a Saturday night and everyone was so friendly. My only wish is that it was in my neighborhood! I will be going again soon and recommend it to anyone :)

Love, Love, Love Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf!!! The staff at the Cave Creek store is soooo friendly and awesome! Their drinks are reasonable and delicious in comparison to Star Bucks! I do my best to stick with Coffee Bean because I feel the quality is better!

Went there with a couple of my friends. I really enjoyed myself! It was a Saturday so we expected a crowd. The energy of the place was great. The musicians were awesome, very engaging and were definite crowd pleasers! The drinks were tasty and the prices weren't too bad. I really wish that we didn't have to pay a cover but I understand why you ask for one, especially on the weekend. The only thing that really bothered me was the outside area. Only one side of the "patio" was opened for use because there was some type of corporate gathering who had reserved the patio yet was not using it. Therefore, the one side that was open to the patrons was jammed packed full of drunkards spilling their drinks and clumsily ashing their cigarettes everywhere. Over all though, I had a great experience there and will more than likely return!

Well it's a movie theater. It does serve it's purpose. The reason for the lower rating is one, you can almost always hear what is going on in the movie next door. If I am not watching an action packed movie I fully expect NOT to hear it. I am not a fan of the IMAX. I also get confused when i walk up and they are not selling tickets from the windows outside. The seats aren't as comfortable as other places and the only reason I frequent this theater is because it is less than 5 minutes from my home.

This is BY FAR the worst Subway I have EVER been to! The service was horrid, we waited almost 10 minutes to be waited on and there was no one else in front of us. They got our order wrong, the employee was incredibly rude and for the price we paid it was not worth it. When we complained to upper Management we did not get a response for over 5 days and they did not even try to offer any type of solution. Needless to say, even though this Subway is the closest to my house I will NEVER go there again and will never recommend it either!

I have frequented this Chili's a couple of times. The very first time I visited I was thoroughly impressed. Our waiter was genuine and so friendly. I have a daughter with special needs and often times when we go out wait staff tends to be stand offish, but not this gentleman. I wish I could remember his name but I did ask for the manager and gave a raving review at the time of our visit. The second and third times I went here I was not as impressed. The wait staff was not nearly as friendly and the last time I went there I seriously felt like my daughter and I were an inconvenience even though we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 20 minutes. The food is always good however, and I will more than likely still return.

We stayed here for business for a few nights. First let me say, the rooms were clean and decent size. We moved from a seedy Days Inn in Mesa to here and it was a huge improvement. Now on to the rough patch. First, the Wi-Fi here is absolutely horrendous! The motel advertises that it has Wi-Fi and yet we were unable to connect the whole time. Second, the front desk staff named Chris is incredibly rude. I'm sorry, if you don't like working with the public then maybe you shouldn't be the front desk auditor of a motel. Third, due to the way the motel is set up you would think there would be an elevator in the lobby to get to the second floor but nope. Fourth, I realize there are smoking rooms in this establishment but the halls just reek of cigarette smoke and to me (a smoker herself) that's just bad.  The motel provided a safe and clean room and that is what it had going for it. The rest should really be worked on.

What can I say that has not already been said? I have lived in Phoenix a little over a year and just recently had the pleasure of attending a first Friday. Being that I have social anxiety I was really nervous to go to this event because I knew there would be crowds! However, I went with a great group of people and had a blast! It was the best experience I have had in AZ since moving here. I highly recommend anyone to attend this event. The music, the art, the people are all worth it and the best part is you don't have to spend a dime if you don't want to! Only thing I would say is because it is so crowded and there were a couple of run ins with some drunks I would not bring my 8 year old daughter along with me. Definitely a great way to spend a Friday night!

So I attended That 1 Guy's Show on Saturday Feb 1st. I was so excited to go, I even talked some of my friends in attending as well. We arrived about an hour before the show was supposed to start. I was very disappointed in the price of the drinks. I could not figure out why a lot of the patrons were drinking PBR until after I ordered my beer. There was no specials going on and I was not impressed with what was in stock behind the bar. The sound was a bit muddled but all in all I am glad I went out. I would more than likely head out to this bar again to support up and coming artists, just not sure if I would waste the money on the drinks next time.
