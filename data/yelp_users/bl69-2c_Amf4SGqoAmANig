I've been coming to this place for while now and I got to give them credit they are accommodating . they once got my order wrong and just gave me about 40 dollars of extra food. But anyways this is favorite spot on the McDowell and 7 ave food selection area. The food always taste fresh, the people are always nice and its not to expensive. Personal favorites the chicken roll up with white beans so good. I also like all the he kabobs. I feel like a good meal with cost 10 dollars usually, the wait time after ordering isn't to long  10 to 15 minutes after logging. It good chain and I recommend it especially if you want to see some green added to your diet.

English Flag tables and a very white hippie/70s /biker bar but its a chill bar. Drinks are cheap plenty of room. If you are planning to watch the straight outta Compton film coming aka, you are looking for a crowd with some color to their faces, I wouldn't recommend this bar. But its pretty clean, server make sure you are attended and they also seem to have a talent of knowing when your empty without hoovering so cool place. Strictly a drink review (after 11pm) , don't know if their food is worthy love.  Side notes - who messages on Yelp, read the review move on.

Now this is my joint, when I am looking for real , let me say it again, real Chinese food. I mean I want take out, I want fried shrimp and I want to walk away feeling like I just added enough food to my system to sleep through the winter , I come to this place. This is my number 1 Chinese take out place. Please do yourself a favor and just order from here. They actually fill your order with the items you want. You want a side of coconut shrimp , you will be eating more shrimp than bread trust me. If you get chicken lo trust me, you will get more meat in there than filler . love this place .

Okay now, I love Chinese but this place made me question my love. First bad sign, the fish tank was dirty as can be and the fish looked dead (only fish I've ever seen gathered together in a pack in a corner). The serves was pretty terrible also, my friend and I came in and no hello no can I help you, had us waiting there and when we said excuse me, got a very face offish response . but we stuck in there, the place looked dirty and the people were rude but hey the food might be great. Wrong ! Let's say that again wrong! The food was terrible , and we bought food for a few people and they all hated it, matter of fact we had to go out and just grab panada instead so remember that. The chicken tasted uncooked and it was some cheap chicken, a friend actually got sick off it, shrimp was still frozen , they didn't even cook the shrimp for us. The noodles , rice , everything was sadly made with no care. I'm sorry but this place should be closed down , don't even try them. Now there are plenty of great Chinese food around better than this nasty place.

I guess the only real scale for grocery stores is section, Mr cleanliness , speed and store decor/area. Prices are going to pretty much the same . Section : pretty normal but no sweet potatoes :( . its pretty clean no compliments. Speed , no self check out and there are only few lanes . store is small old and in a popular area so it's busy which conflicts with having a fee lanes. I usually drive to the one on 7ave instead newer and faster.

I am going to give this place a better rating because they made me a sandwich filled with meat and a smoothie for 12.50. I was starving and a their smaller size sub hit the spot. I went to this place with 12 people from a conference at the Marriott and they had all our food ready and smoothies in no time . great service great taste

I've been going here for about 6 years so comparably  of my review is a little low. But I have to say their selection of eye wear had been beautiful. Marc Jacobs , DY , Calvin , and sport effective wear. They have it. I like their doctors also all of them are amazing and funny. Nice location , new shop also . of course check with your insurance and if you don't may have to go cheaper location .the service is great for everything except one area, phone calls, and telling you your glasses are ready. 6/years not once have I got a call before I had to call and also I've been placed on hold way to long 25 minutes before the phone just disconnected , phone game is low. But once again, that would be a big factor but everything else here is so perfect I over look it completely .

I cannot talk bad about this place, now I have other favorite Mexican food spots but this place is open late and deliver fast. So for us late not munchers, us to tired to make a meal, and us I need something to soak up this liquir look no farther , this is the place. The meats , are actually well seasoned and taste fresh . I haven't had a bad experience in that department . its a great place price wise really cheap and you get a a lot for your buck. Now the only thing working against this place is the location. But trust me its safe for all my favorite snow flakes out there, the surrounding area is no longer bad. I also think a sign would help but the food , is great. Now the interior could use a redesign if I am being honest. I order to go based on this. Go get a meal and trust me its worth the order.

Went thru drive thru so can't really relate the inside to everyone. Their drive thru machine needs a little updating , its very hard to hear and its mainly due to the machine . they have one big menu , there is alot to choose from , they have burgers , Mexican food, Greek items. Subs its much more than a burger shop. Now the first thing I tired were their shakes and I have to give them credit Oreo shakes are not on menu but its 100 percent worth getting . I ordered two chili burgers and large fries to split. Let me tell you its a lot of food. The chili burger was really good , they actually attempted and succeed to make a chilli burger . usually at some low end burger places , you get a very low end can chili but this place did it right. Also large fries are large fries and they are delicious. I have to give this place credit on the outside its not fancy but it is worth the trip for burger. I will have to come back to try more of their massive menu. Also the burger is on the level of a five guys burger but they have more options in types of burgers.

O o o , when it comes to breakfast , I feel like everyone has one go to place for breakfast and First Watch claimed my title. Best Breakfast place in Phoenix , I have had the pleasure of being served in.   First thing which everyone must try, the hot chocolate , the best way to start your (in my case) late morning. So good and they give you a decent size mug to enjoy this drink . Now the amount of food you get is enough to cover a few meals in your day which is a big bonus. But the winning prize goes to the flexibility of the menu and the staff. I do not eat pork and if you are the type to want some meat in your omelette its hard to choose something off the menu without pork in it. First watch has plenty of substitute options and they do not count pennies on the ingredients, they stack it up.  I believe I purchased the avocado omelette and a two pancake side. The omelette, I asked if I could sub in some turkey sausage and they delivered . the plate was packed with potato , omelette and English muffin. Now the pancakes, o my was the cherry on top, best pancakes out there. Fluffy , filling and man it actually warms my heart knowing there is someone out there , who took the time to deliver those stacks.   Overall great restaurant , friendly staff , whoever the owners are bravo , open up a First Watch next door to me cause I will be there everyday . also my bill was about 30 dollars for myself and my girlfriend to order breakfast with coffee and 2 hot chocolates so its not over priced and I would of paid more for that meal.

You can't ask much from a bowling alley , besides clean shoes (which are strangely Westbrook stylish) , enough room to bowl without bumping into another group, games, of course for adults a bar and o the most important thing , a very low chance of being stabbed in the parking lot. Blood and bowling just make for an upset night. This place has it all. Chandler just has nice things . the place was nice , its about 3.99 per person, per game so it cost me about 50 dollars for 4 games and the shoes. So pretty standard. I would like if they had an option if you come early in the day and theirs like 2 people in the whole place. But it is also cheaper if you go mon-friday. 2.99 a game instead . Anyways good bowling lanes and its plenty full of lanes .

The prices are a little higher than normal but the food is of a higher quality. I love this place. They have this white sauce that will make you question way have you been putting soy sauce on food ever. They have a great staff and a very short wait time. If you in town take some time and stop by. They have a healthier spin on take out so its good food which doesn't leave you feeling bloated afterwards.

Got to say food quality taste wise not the best, this place is more of five guys without the great taste. It is a diner so you got the low end diner feel which is fine, food does comes out fast. I got a triple burger , chili fries and another burger for the annoyed girlfriend , it came out to about 17.50. Once again 5 guy prices but my issue is this. There are alot of great food places around this place along with a five guys (reoccurring theme) which are in the area. In my opinion spend your money at one of those. But this place is much better than drive through fast food. But I just might be spoiled when it comes to a good burger.

Great deal, 6 dollars for a 12 inch steak with an additional topping which was packed with meat on a Sunday and it was a good steak. The guys makes making the magic happen are friendly, let us know about deals to save money and the food came out so fast. Great place , nice and quiet . huge ranch dipping container just in case you are thinking of buying an additional one, trust me you might not need it , and I use a alot of ranch . wings are great, cheesy sticks great and the fries are great. I might being sounding like classic Tony the Tiger, this place really is great. Much recommended and thank you for a good meal.

I should of wrote this review months ago. This is the best sub / sandwich / lunch / if you need something eat , spot in the area. I work walking  distance and made I can grab a sub at 11 and be full till 9 pm . They stack their subs here and they take care of their customers. They also have a few funny staff members. So I always like to get the chipotle cheddar steak , so good with little bit of extra turkey and made that sub would satisfy a charging bear.   Anyways the place is in a business center sonit can be a little hard to find due to a tree up front but it is completely worth the find.

Eddie is the man. On a Saturday I was looking for a barber shop in Phx. Could not find one, I called this shop and they were closed but Eddie told me to come in since he picked up phone and he would cut my hair not a problem. Great hair cut and even better overseas conversation.

Okay just letting anyone know there is pei wei not even half a mile down the street. I can only judge the pad tai but I am not a fan at all . it tasted like just noodles if I'm being honest and compared to a pei wei, you are better off paying a lower price and getting a better attempt. The chicken was a little chewy , the sauce was very minimum and even the shrimp needed to be cook in sauce. Hey but noodles were cooked fine. The place looks cool diner setting and the people working there are nice but man , I can not recommend their food. At least off the pad tai. Other items on their menu may be better.

Now that I'm in Chandler I think I have found my new pet doc for all my vaccine , teeth cleaning and dietary needs .  Now if you live in South Chandler , you are use to having your own gym , stores without long lines and lots elbow room , this pet stores meets those requirement especially when you may have a dog which needs space from other dogs. The front room is very spacious . quite of few owner can wait in front area , and give each other plenty of space.  Setting appointments are pretty easy, and they take appointments all through out the day. I called 5 different places , and this location was able to fit me in and also give me 20 dollars off my first appointment plus additional 25 dollars off my seconds dog's cost for my first visit.  The Vets were pretty awesome , took care of dogs were very respectful and very tactical about my telling me to work my Ali out more , which is very respectful .  My appointment even went like hour over and they didn't rush me , and even let me get one additional mirco-chip for my second dog even though I forgot to request that earlier.   I really like this place and plan to use this vet exclusivity so yeah, I recommend it .

At the moment I am searching for my next phx barber and this place is on the list. First time I went there was a power outage so no hair cut. But I made my way back around to them and got to say good barber . Mark , one of the owners cut my hair , and he did right by me. Got a low fade, razor lining and a machine shoulder massage which threw me off a bit lol. But 15 dollars and you walk out with a great cut. My next did get missed which is free with every cut but that's fine, the conversation had me cracking up. Russian guy but he can cut black hair. The cut took about half an hour but we were talking and the wait seems to be pretty short around the time I went in (11am). I will be going back .

Copper blue , copper blue, now copper blue has a little competition across the "alley" but overall good bar. Drinks they make them , the only a bar should strong. Very big selection of beers and the food is actually okay. But I will say the big winner is their stage for cover bands and performances . I am little stuck in my kanye ways but they have a good choice for a wider audience . bands are multi genre talented. Also bartenders are lookers so watch your eyes if you are bringing your girl. I would recommend this bar if you have some friends in town , plenty of room , and you can sit back and just relax. O and nice bathrooms very nice. My only negative is , I had to ask if they validate parking . parking in down town phx is expense and not easy. They do validate parking for a public lot across the street but it would of just been nice to have that be a general question. Who doesn't like to avoid paying for parking after good food, good music and great atmosphere.

A friend recommended this place as the best chain sub place and I have to say subway , I will always love you but firehouse is killing it. This particular store has a very pretty look to it. They have the newer touch screen soda machines and a bunch of hot sauce options. The sub was great , I got the firehouse meatball with steak added and man that was a Ton of food for 9.75. It was over a foot long and everything was just great . I highly recommend these subs , the girlfriend got the brisket and it looked pretty good also. Anyways the people were nice and the subs were stacked that's pretty much all you need.

This is nice place, great for people to get a drink or hang out side. I feel like you wouldn't go to this bar for dancing , or to get turnt up , and if you are looking for school of Rock crowd or a cultural mixing pot this may not be your bar on the average night.   The crowd , seems to be a mixture of college students and older (classic dad's with teenage at home) age groups. Seems like you get college students who get dressed up to sit at a table and hangout with good friends. And on flip older folk doing the same but in shorts, hats and some relaxing running sneakers.   But I. Honestly feel like this bar does one thing great and that is space. They really do give every group space from each other. This isn't a bar where you meet people , it seems like one where you bring you own group and live in your own space and this bar does a great job in creating that space. Tons of tables , and even more outside. Plenty room to move around but also  plenty room to fit multiple big groups .   Didn't try the food, and I actually went a little weak and had their ciders but good selection on tap .

So much food, but so good. So pricing first , 1. 1 Margarita (didn't have it) 2. Mini Shrimp Chimi (so good shrimp cream cheese, o so lovely) 3. El Hefe chimi ( so big , yo the grill chicken they put in this monster was so much meat , plate was packed) 4. Number 7 I didn't have it but plate was FULL  Every thing came out to about 50 dollars, I would recommend skip the drinks , and appetizers if you want to save money , (shrimp chimi is good tho) and just get the entre you will be get plenty of food. I just like to say this, each plate was huge and not filled with easy fillers , I mean they really give you a meal. Also additional boost the night we went they gave part of each sell to the honor society to help kids travel for education trip so credit to you. Great place and must try.

Now this is going to be weird but I don't like the pizza but there is a saving grace and big tasty one which is their  Mac and Cheese. 4.25 for small one and 9.50 for big one but let's be real you will want some meat added which is 1 dollar for small and 1.95 for a big one. But it is worth it really tasty and alot of options . once again their pizza is just not for me it is really not my cup of tea kind of like flat bread and cheese. I would give their pizza a 1 if it is was based on just that but the Mac and Cheese is so dang good. The place is nice to sit down and have a beer also the prices are pretty average for drinks but their are really cheaper options for drinks. Once again the Mac and cheese worth it .

Okay this gym is new new , so I have to give it 5 stars because there a few things everyone wishes for at the gym but the main thing is drum roll please ...... Access to machines . Chandler is pretty far out and this gym is way south going towards hunt so there is almost no ever there . I am talking 5 PM weekday after work , during rush hour time hardly anyone compared to the LA fitness farther north . I personally love it because you spend no time waiting .  Bonus points 1. its clean  2. Everything seem new machine wise, little wear 3. Pretty ladies up front especially if you are night person  4. Juice bar 5. It's Chandler so location wise it's pretty nice area, and the people reflect it.  Negative points 1 one water spot, so bring a bottle 2. Basketball court   they designed it to small or didn't plan enough to allocate enough space for correct spacing .    But regardless location and the capacity just makes it the perfect gym if you live in Chandler so 5 stars

Alright forget los betos , forget chipotle, forget most of the burrito shops which are step above fast food. Phx burrito is the place to go for a great burrito the house special is on point, but my favorite the chicken burrito just makes the mouth water. So the burritos come with rice , your choice of beans , your choice of meat , along with the other usual stuff sour cream and so on but they do not skip on anything . This is the spot to go. Also a big thing I love about the place are the people that work there, funny folk which remember your name, now that might be that I have been there to much which in that case I may have an addiction but trust me give it a try.

I just want to start off my saying service is so good here and I regretfully didn't write down or store the gentleman's name in my attractive brain. But, back to. The gentleman up front , great personality , great showmen and just a overall nice guy. Not only gave us popcorn as  we waited but entertained us with great humor and showed us some beautiful burger pics.   Now the food, mmmm if you like flavor of chili, if you like meat in the form of burgers/hot dogs . prepare your mouth cause this place is great.   Cost: beautiful , I got chili cheese hotdog , dirty burger ,Mac cheese burger and homemade fries for like 23 bucks .  Size : so much food, ate at like 4 didn't eat the rest of the day.   Taste: These guys know how to cook whats on the menu so much flavor. Put away the mustard and ketchup , you won't need to add anything else to what they have put together for you   Overall: This place , is a repeat visit , for every customer .

I'm not really into golf at all, but its a nice looking place . now if you put the address in google it will take you to the Hilton parking lot. But take the parking lot exit and you will find yourself in their parking lot of top golf. Now the drinks are cheap here real cheap if you come with groups. Shots , beer all good but I did not their food. The driving range is pretty cool, it has a nice view of talking stick so at night you get a light show. It's not to loud, they place nice pop music and over all the place looks pretty

I liked this place , didn't try any of the beers on tap , but I will say the Juicy Lucy Burger and the fries were pretty pretty PHAT , like juicy is a great name for that burger .  Cost : Juicy Lucy + All America Burger + Beer + Tip runs you about 40 dollars if you are good tipper , if not about 30 dollars .  All Burgers , cost around 11 to 15 and a 18 burger is on the list which is monster.  Chips are the standard side, so if you want fries or totes it will cost an extra 2 dollars onto your burger .  The servicers if you get a lady are pretty and polite. When our order came in , they got one of our sides wrong, but they corrected it and gave us a full order to go no charge . So thank you.   The food is good for a good ole burger done however you prefer and it seems like a good place to watch a game and they do ufc fights also so bonus .   Great place
