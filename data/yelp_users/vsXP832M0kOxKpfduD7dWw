This is the best place to watch theater in the Valley. No such thing as a bad seat. Acoustics are excellent. Small enough to feel intimate but big enough to not be confused with your neighbor's basement. I've enjoyed every performance I've seen here.

I have been here once. Thank you Genny C.   I had the chilaquiles y huevos ($7.95: cut up corn tortillas smothered in red chile and cheese and topped with eggs - i suggest over medium). A huge fan of huevos rancheros, I had never had chilaquiles (or heard of them) before this visit.  They took hold of me! I dream of them now. I wake longing for them. I wish they were served past 10:30.   As for the restaurant: the place is ginormous! Don't let the security guards in the parking lot put you off. Instead, let them get the door for you and take comfort in a delicious meal served by friendly staff who will greet you in Spanish but just as easily will answer you in English.

The crab cakes are delicious -- REAL crab and not a lot of filler! Not into crab? The relleno stuffed with veggies and goat cheese and served on polenta is a delicious treat! You can add chicken but it's not necessary... you get two giant peppers!

In quintessential Bianco style, every ingredient is chosen for its quality and, as a result, you have a sandwich worthy of a love affair. I always stick with the tomato, mozzarella and basil - the basil is bright, crisp and fragrant; the mozzarella is the real deal firm and milky; and, the tomatoes are always bright and soft but not mushy.   The bread? The bread is perfect. Absolutely. Perfect. And just the right bread to sandwich filling ratio.   Beverage choices (especially low calorie caffeinated ones) are limited, but you can always run next door to Lux for an iced tea or coffee. Personally, I enjoy a sparkling mineral water to compliment my lunch here.   In your lunch sack, you will find a sweet treat to finish your meal. Most recently, I had a dark chocolate cowboy boot. My favorite is when there is a French caramel.   4 stars instead of 5 because: the limited beverage selection and, mostly, because seating is limited and outdoor only.   On a nice day, they are a solid 5 stars, but lunch hour after a night of rain that has left the the wood benches damp enough to transfer or in 115 degree summer heat, they drop to 4 stars.

Not ordinarily a fan of Chinese food, I am a fan of China Chili!   For $10 (and that's with a soft drink) the lunch special portions are huge (like enough to get a box and take home leftovers, huge!) and the Mongolian beef  is an option.   Service is wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am but that works for a weekday lunch at a place that's 6 miles from the office.  Enjoyed dinner here with the family a few weeks back and service had a much more enjoyable pace.  Food has been consistently tasty. I like the batter they use for items like the lemon and orange chicken, etc. and the meat quality is good (i.e. all white meat chicken).   This place could get me craving Chinese and that's an accomplishment!

Not religious? No problem! We're talking roller skating, weightlifting and weight loss.  You see, all this Yelping has helped me pack on the pounds to the point where I decided to rejoin Weight Watchers (I'm a 2-time, lifetime member, going for try number 3, sadly. More than halfway to my weigh loss goal this go-around, though!). There's a Monday night Weight Watchers meeting in the Family Life Center, which is basically a recreation center. As a result of attending the meetings, I've come to find out about all the amenities, open even to non-church members, that go on here at a really reasonable rate!  We're talking a roller skating rink (I think it's $3 including skate rental AND you can have birthday skating parties here), group fitness, free weights, a nautilus/cardiovascular room, handball/racquetball courts, a basketball gymnasium, fit express circuit, a games area and more! They even have locker rooms.  They're open Monday - Friday from 5:30 a.m. - 9 p.m. and on Saturdays from 5:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. If you're not a church member it's $30/month for individual memberships but the real deal is in the family memberships! A family of 3 or more just pays $50 month. Although there's no Family Life Center membership required to attend Weight Watcher meetings.  5 stars for building community and promoting healthy spirits AND bodies!!

I don't get what people like about this place. It's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress. I've tried at least twice -- maybe I'm ordering wrong but I really just don't get it...

Great spot to pick up an elegant hostess gift, cool cocktail napkins, ornaments and miscellaneous home decor items. Reasonable prices and pretty packaging/gift wrapping. You'll likely be greeted when you enter and, if you convey the gist of what you are looking for, the staff are wonderful about showing items that may meet your need.

I really have a hard time calling Pomeroy's a dive bar and, when challenged, I can't completely justify why I have this struggle.   Sure, the tables are carved up with things like "Yelp" and "I am RAD" (Heya, Julia!!) and the seating is like an unupholstered school bus bench.   Sure, there's multicolored, tinsel, holiday lights hanging around the pool area.   Sure, they sell Schlitz and PBR - and Michelob 64.   And, of course, the pièce de résistance: 1-ply TP...   But, those dudes in the kitchen know how to work a flat top grill! Menu offerings (besides the cracker jacks and Gardetto's snacks for purchase behind the bar) include hot dogs, burgers (I am SO getting a patty melt next time), chicken and other grilled sandwiches. There are also some salad options if you're not feelin' the grease.   But the highlight for me is the green chile! And, they'll put it on anything! It's like I'm back in New Mexico!! First time I went, I had the turkey green chile melt ($7.75). Last night, I enjoyed a grilled cheese ($3.95) and asked them to add green chile. It was perfect! Big strips! Enough for chile in every bite!   Sandwiches are served with a choice of fries, fruit, salad, cottage cheese or chips - but really?! When fries are involved is there REALLY a choice? In this case there is because they even have a couple of different types of fries (crinkle, wedge or shoestring)!   I guess that's the dilemma: When I think of going to Pomeroy's I am as excited about the 15 beers on tap and cheap cocktails as I am about the food! I've thought about going to Pomeroy's for lunch on a weekday - without even the intention of sneaking a brew in the middle of the work day! How about we call it a dive restaurant... compromise?

I am not a hot dog connoisseur. I'll be honest. I mostly dislike hot dogs.  Growing up, our family tradition was to eat a hot dog on New Year's day. My mom (and grandmother before that) would say you'd be guaranteed to have money in your pocket year round (and that every meal after would be sure to be better). I ranked this "tradition" right up there with the mandatory liver and onions dinner once a year.   Well, I must confess: since Dottsy Z. introduced me to Great Dane's I have craved and enjoyed a chili dog on my own volition on more than one occasion.   The soft poppy seed bun provides a pillowy home for a the steamed dog (which could be grilled upon request) that offers a nice mild flavor with the famous snap. The chili is an excellent compliment providing a nice additional texture. All a this and yummy skinny fries for under $5? At that rate, I really do have a shot at money in my pocket all year!  So, my hat is off to Great Dane's for doing what my mother and grandmother were never able to do: eat a hot dog and enjoy it!

I am recently recovered from a cold. It started in my head and has moved to my chest. While the cough has held on, I credit Scott's Generations (and Nyquil) for the bulk of my speedy recovery!  There's nothing like a flavorful broth and your choice of noodle, rice, matzo ball, or (my choice) kreplach for a miracle cure. A full quart'll set you back around $8.   Even better: you don't have to be sick to enjoy this place.   I also like Scott's for breakfast. Excellent corned beef hash. Plus, the whole diner feel and a good, chewy bagel has the potential to transport you to parts East.

Phoenix City Grille knocked my socks off with some special treats they dazzled us with at a CMYE (Community Manager Yelp Event) and I recently returned with the generous buy-one-get-one voucher they sent us home with (it expires on the 30th, fellow Yelpers who haven't redeemed theirs yet).   After the delicious scallops at our Yelp event, you can guess what I had my heart set on -- hopeful that there would be a special, since they are not a regular menu offering.   Fortunately for me, there was a short rib and scallop special. It was accompanied by fried green beans. The sort rib was good. Definitely tender with a real hearty, rich, beefy flavor. There was only 1 scallop. It was a little tougher than the ones showcased at our event.   Trying to minimize the calories, I asked for plain green beans instead. The kitchen sent out the fried which our server quickly noted and corrected, leaving the fried ones for my dinner partner to enjoy. Lacking any substantive willpower, I nibbled one or two and they were quite tasty. A light tempura coating combined with the cooking technique offered a unique, enjoyable flavor.   My "plain" green beans were dressed in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper (just like I make at home). Still crisp, they were delicious!   So, I got my wish with the special, but the the regular menu challenges decision-making abilities with so many great options!   My friend got the beef tenderloin and it was, quite possibly, the best steak I've had in the Valley. It was fabulously tender (even cooked medium well) and perfectly seasoned. I look forward to ordering one for myself on a future visit.   I had heard about the bread pudding from the CMYE reviews and so we splurged with dessert. It was phenomenal! Think the fluffiest, most custardy french toast flavor you've ever had! Thank goodness it was cut into two pieces -- better for a peaceful sharing.   Another tip from the CMYE, thanks to Don S., I tried the Brophy Clark Pinot Noir ($11/glass) and it was love at first sip! I liked it so much, I called Total Wine to see about buying a bottle for home and searched the vineyard's website for where to buy a bottle in Arizona but didn't get very far. I guess I'll have to add that to the reasons to return to Phoenix City Grille!

If I'm lucky and they have them when the mood strikes, I love to pick up a sfogliatelle (sfoy-yah-tell): crunchy, triangle shaped Italian pastries (kind of like a phyllo-croissant) filled with orange-flavored ricotta and sometimes candied citrus peel and bring it home for breakfast with a nice cup of espresso made on the stove.

I love the Wrigley Mansion!   I was there a few years ago for a wine maker's dinner and it was beyond memorable: the food, the wine, the views.  And, just last night about 12 of us gathered to celebrate a birthday. The staff were very accommodating and offered us the loft above Geordie's for a semiprivate feel. We didn't have any "minimums" or "room rentals." Our server did a great job and got quite the work out going up and down the stairs with our drinks and food! Happy hour runs until 7 and features $5 specialty martinis, which are full size and strength! There's even a tequilla-tini that tastes like a margarita and looks like a Mexican flag!  The executive chef came up to welcome and thank our group, which was such a hospitable gesture! I told him how I enjoyed the truffle fries and the burger (see Andrew K's review - BTW, I'm the one who screwed it up by saying "not too much pink") and he explained how they pride themselves on knowing where all their food comes from. They even dry those apples themselves - in-house!  It's true that the place was NOT crowded, which works for me because it means I don't have to fight with anyone for a seat to watch some of the country's best sunsets over a cocktail! I really need to come here more often! I will definitely be back!!

I always forget about this place and when I stumble upon it I am pleasantly surprised by all the cute gifts, awesome journal selection and abundant books to choose from every time!   It's not as large as most Barnes & Noble but they are affiliated so your membership card will work here too AND they can get anything any Barnes & Noble can. Its smaller size, however, lends itself to a more independent bookstore/library feel.

I can't help it. I think Mac Geniuses are so hot. Knowing they are there to help me figure out any problems I may have with my computer for FREE is one of my favorite things about being an Apple user.   Seriously, who needs a manual?  I mostly use this store for tech support. Fortunately, I don't have to go too often. It's so easy. You can make an appointment with the genius bar via computer at home. Waltz in 1 minute before your appointment time and get all the help you need from some brainy computer geek a minute later.   The store as a retail option is confusing. Who do you talk to for what and when? Though, it's cool that whoever's helping you can ring you up right there in the middle of the sales floor. At least you don't have to go wait in a register line after you've cracked the code! :)

Talkin' about Happy Hour here... You really can't beat the selection or price on the 1/2 off champagne cocktails and wine. Food is quality also. It seems an undiscovered gem as we were the only ones there for quite some time, only to be joined by 2 small groups.   I had the mini brioche sliders ($8). You get to choose 3. I went with the crab cake, lamb and beef. I don't think I would get the lamb again, but the other two were adorable, satisfactory nuggets! (They are indeed mini.)   As for my cocktail selection, I started with the champagne with  bigarade liqueur (Orange liqueur from Provence: it tasted like a perfectly balanced mimosa with no calories wasted on juice! ;)) but also enjoyed the malbec and tried the cava (it was too sweet for me).  Hands down, this place is in the top 5 best happy hours in the Valley!     (https://www.vincentsoncamelback.com/vincents/bleu-menu.php)

Seriously frustrated by my recent shopping experience -- or should I say, check out experience -- at this Target.   I must've been wearing my invisibility cloak, because the first line I was in closed as it was my turn to check out, even though I had been in the line while her light was on and there was no one in line behind me. The next line I moved to was excruciatingly slow and, again, the woman didn't notice me after she finished with the customer ahead of me. When she did see me, she began to ring me up.   In all fairness, I'm short and I had my cart piled with storage containers that MAY have made it difficult to see me behind it, but certainly my cart was visible. Further, I was dragging a rolling trash can behind me. Not an easy feat, I might add.   I had a cumbersome load. "Yes, thank you. I WOULD like help out with this." ...but no one ever came.   Given the amount of time I had already spent in line, I needed to get back to the office. As I'm attempting to make my way to the car by myself, I get stopped by the security guard who wants to see my receipts (Ala Costco). So, evidently now I'm visible... or carts moving on their own are suspicious.   I show my receipts and ask if she can help me to my car with them once we've established I legitimately purchased them. Of course, her priority is her post but she offers to call someone. As does the dude standing there behind her... in the red Target shirt.   Frustrated, as this has been done already. I say, I really don't have time to stand here and wait for someone to come up here. And continue to make my way to my car myself. While the two of them stand there... presumably.

If you want to go to Havana Cafe, follow my lead:  I can't break the delicious habit of starting with a mango rum mojito or sangria depending on my mood.   No need to order "dinner." Chose 3 tapas... I'll pick two and you can pick ONE. I pick the papa rellena ($6.50) potato croquettes about the size of a tennis ball (one for each of us) filled with ground beef and topped with a delicious lime cilantro sauce (Yes, I used the words delicious and cilantro in the same sentence! Me! The girl who HATES cilantro!!) and the black bean fritters (frituras de frijoles negres $5.25), little poppers accompanied by a scrumptious calypso avocado dip that is laced with either sour cream or cream cheese or both! The third item is your choice.   Finish it off with a Cuban coffee (a sweetened shot of espresso) and possibly, depending on willpower or lack thereof, the Caribbean candy bar - coconut flan topped with a rum fudge sauce and toasted almonds.   Truly, this is the best way to enjoy Havana Cafe!

This library is a hidden neighborhood gem!   For years, people would tell me the library was "right behind McDonalds" and that threw me. It's not true. It's not behind McDonalds! Technically, it's not even behind Walgreens, but that would be closer. The trick is: from 7th St., you have to turn east onto Townley which is the street between the McDonalds and Walgreens and then... there it is on your left! A tiny little library.   On my first visit I felt jilted by the apparently small selection but then I learned I could find any book I wanted on www.phxlib.org (even from home), ask for a hold on the book and have it transfered for me to pick up at Acacia. So, even if the book is not on the shelf, I can get it there! What more do you need?   Same goes for the audiobooks and DVDs.   And, speaking of what you can do online: all Phoenix library card holders can access online learning resources (I used to use Rosetta Stone. They've recently switched to Auralog which I haven't tried yet), databases and several subscription based resources (like Consumer Reports) for free from home!  In the branch, they've recently added a birth to 5 area for toddlers, have lots of activities for teens (including a teen council) and from what I understand a remodel is in the works. Since the interior is a little dated, I'll save the 5th star for after the remodel but this place has everything you need!  So, using a doubly appropriately cliche, when it comes to Acacia branch library, you can't judge a book by it's cover. (Sorry. I couldn't resist!)

Yu-u-u-M!  The sauce is a sweet and not too acidic and the spaghetti and meatball calzone (add ricotta) is cravable! I saw the meatball sandwich and can't believe a single human being could consume one on their own. I swear it must be three pounds of meatballs on a full french loaf! I only wish they were open for lunch on Sundays because for some reason that's when I always think, "Yum! A spaghetti and meatball calzone would be great right now." Oh well. My loss, I suppose...

I thought I was going to really impress some friends when they discovered the highly touted "famous" chocolate fountain feature of our surprise Sunday brunch.   Allow me to help manage YOUR expectations, so you're not as disappointed as I was: Yes, there is a chocolate fountain and it is included with your $8-13 brunch entree; but, buy your own(probably identical) model at Wal-mart for $40 and save yourself the heartache of a disappointing meal.   Granted, we came for the "famous" chocolate fountain but we were prepared to enjoy breakfast first! Another disappointment.   I had the breakfast burrito and could only stomach the beans. The potatoes tasted like they'd been in the freezer too long. The eggs in my burrito were chewy not "lightly" scrambled in the slightest.  The machaca had decent flavor but it was further ruined by the enchilada sauce that tasted straight from a generic can!  One of my guests had pancakes. Sadly, these were neither light nor fluffy, instead they were chewy and tough just like my eggs.   "The myriad of accompaniments you can serve with the chocolate fountain are only limited by your imagination" in theory, but at Aunt Chilada's this past Sunday, your choices were dry chunks of cantaloupe, flavorless honeydew, pineapple cubes, (shall we say "aged") marshmallows, and the unimaginative standby: strawberries. Oh! And, crispy lady fingers.   Full disclosure: I did not tell our server how much I hated my burrito or the pancakes and she DID ask how everything tasted.   Truthfully: I was weary from the disappointment. It's one thing to send back an entree but to say everything was unsatisfactory?! I just won't recommend it or plan to return.

Just got in from a great evening at Grinders! Who knew you could hear amazing blues music for free -- in Sunnyslope of all places -- on the 2nd Saturday of each month!? I did, actually. The real question is why don't I go every month!?  So, now I'm hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem. Truly, the Valley's BEST neighborhood coffee shop! For a number of reasons...  1.) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi-fi.  2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth.   3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)  4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica!   We really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!

Food City doesn't meet my regular grocery shopping needs; however, whenever I need to buy a cake this is the first place I think of! The five stars are for the the Tres Leches cake alone!   A yellow cake moist with the three milks (evaporated, condensed and whole) but not soggy and frosted with a barely sweet whipped topping. Ordinarily more of a butter cream gal, myself, this frosting is the PERFECT compliment to the cake!   Inspired after my first try, I started experimenting with Tres Leches from other bakeries or panaderias and I have to say... Food City's was my favorite.   So, quick! Somebody have a birthday so we can get a cake!!!

A while back, I had tried the meatball sandwich and remember really enjoying the sauce so when the opportunity presented to watch the Super Bowl, walking distance from home, and enjoy a pie, I was all about it! Let me just say: Remarkably good pizza for a divey sports bar! Our server was really nice and the prices are great!   They're a fun bunch, too! Super Bowl festivities included a pool, and food and drink specials based on the game (see uploaded photo). In addition to $6 mini-pitchers of beer, we indulged in ASU girl shots which are awesomely served in a pee cup! There's always the opportunity for off track betting here and, it appears from the tables stacked in the bathroom, an occasional poker game.

One year, by matter of coincidence, I was in Bobby D's for a drink after work on St. Patrick's day and I couldn't help but notice the steady stream of neighborhood folk coming in for take out corned beef and cabbage.   This year, I enlisted a coworker to accompany me and bear witness to the fact that it was NOT a liquid lunch so I could see what the fuss was about! (It is a workday, after all!)   For $7.95 you get a platter full of well-seasoned, fork-tender corned beef, at least a quarter of a boiled cabbage, cooked carrots and potatoes. A small plate featuring creamy horseradish, horseradish and spicy mustard was delivered with our meal. Corned beef sliders were another option ($5.95), although we took the traditional route.   While the flavor on the corned beef was excellent (we detected a hint of cinnamon), the veggies lacked seasoning.   Other fun facts about what you can find at Bobby D's:  ~ Lots of neighborhood peeps sportin' their green on St. Patty's  ~ TVs -- I got to watch a little of the NCAA tournament during lunch!  ~ $1 vodka soaked gummy bears (an interesting novelty in which I did not indulge)

Taking my car to the shop is like going to the dentist. I can sometimes get a little stressed out about what's going to happen and how much it's going to hurt (cost) but it's a necessary evil.   It was a relief to find Central Car Care. This family owned car service and repair place at Dunlap and 3rd St. offers reasonable prices ($19.95 for an oil change), patience (when I'm asking my 80-billion "how do you know you HAVE to do that" questions or whine about how badly I do NOT want to spend my money on fixing my car) and fair, honest service (when my replacement battery didn't last a full year, they changed it out for free!). They've always completed my work on time and greet me by name when I walk in the door -- even when I don't have an appointment and it's been months since my last visit.   They guarantee all of their work (parts and labor) for 15 months, 15,000 miles, which gives me some peace of mind. And, host an annual customer appreciation event where they discount tires, oil changes and the like...   It's conveniently located by the Sunnyslope Transit Station, so public transportation makes for easy access (although, shuttle service is available and they have rental cars if it's an overnight deal).   Paul, Tommy and Rex are awesome and do a great job taking care of me and my vehicle!

I still love this place. Today, I brought my car in because the tire was low. Seems I've run over some nails. While waiting, I noticed they have one of those arcade basketball games to play for FREE while you're killing time. I TOTALLY suck, by the way. Didn't make a SINGLE shot. But, it's something to do beside watch Oprah!

Although I love Gallagher's and this is my neighborhood standby for a quick and easy frothy adult beverage with friends, I was first leaning toward giving only four stars -- mainly because the quality of the "fresher" elements of the food (i.e. lettuce, jalapenos, etc.) is not especially consistent. But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why:   *FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!)   *Build your own burger - not only can you pick your "meat" but you can pick your "bun" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce.   *Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!)   * Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had "Reserved For..." signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my "#1 go to watch a game" spot for all time.   P.S. If your preference is "fake cheese" nachos, as mine is, then hands-down these are the best nachos in the Valley. (If you like real cheese on your nachos, you are on your own!!)

Finally! I'm getting security doors for a little cross-ventilation opportunity in my pad. I live in an HOA-ruled community so the hoops had encouraged my procrastination. I couldn't take the heat anymore and, just in time for the cold-chill, I found the doors I wanted at my neighborhood home depot , lined up the contractor and submitted my design review request.   There were only 2 of the door style I wanted on the floor when I scouted them and I needed them both -- but not for at least a week. I called and spoke to someone in flooring, vaguely described my door -- "the copper one... only 2 out..." --and began to ask about hardware that would coordinate. The guy indicated that there were plenty of options and that he was with another customer but to come on in and we could work it out.  2 hours later, I made it into the store. Walked back to doors and, alas, there were no more of the door I wanted on the floor. Deflated, I found comfort in the fact that I had time to "special order"  and  began to seek out the door guy to get started.   Whatdya know!?! It was Greg, the same guy I had spoken with earlier and, because the doors are popular (someone else had called too), he pulled 2 doors for me! Greg helped me find some good hardware to coordinate and even noticed a discrepancy in the price (evidently the product was in the wrong place on the shelves) while processing the order and made the necessary adjustments to give me the lower price we had thought they would be.  He completely took care of me! Some of the best customer service I've had in a long time.   The fact that it's pretty easy to find a decent parking spot and the people in the store are generally helpful in directing you to the correct aisle or recommending just the right do-dad to fix your whatchamacallit, etc. make this a 4-star store but my recent door shopping experience has earned that coveted 5th star!

Based on the quick tip I posted: "Check expiration dates :(" You should be able to figure out why I don't love this store.   It used to be my regular grocery spot but they have really let things slide, lately. Recently, I was picking up some yogurt (the store brand bartlet pear is one of my favorite flavors!) and found most of what was on the shelf in the flavor I wanted to have expired. NOT GOOD. Especially since the nearby Fry's used to be scary but it's not any more. Not to mention there's a Fresh & Easy and an AJs across the street.  Come on Safeway... don't relegate my business to watching for Coke products to be on sale!

I just finished up a gift certificate to Yoga Pura (5 sessions). Most of it was used on a Yin Yoga class (Monday nights at 7:30). Yin Yoga involves mostly stretching focusing mostly on your spine and hips. Postures are held for anywhere from 3-10 minutes. Nyla, the instructor, is such a peaceful, calming influence. I was so impressed with the fact that she noticed I was new to her class right away and yet she made me feel completely welcome.   I also attended a flow class one Saturday morning. I've done vinyasa yoga before but never been exposed to binding positions. I found this class to be more challenging, but still enjoyable. Next time, I'll introduce myself to the instructor in advance and be sure to pick a spot where I can see better.   The only reason I took off a star is because the rooms are often stinky from the sweaty folks in the class before. A sign of a good workout, but I wish they would try to air them out a bit between sessions. AND, because, I was really only interested in the flow and yin (once I tried it) classes and I found the limited offerings difficult to work into my schedule.  Still, I'm glad to have discovered this sanctuary for the mind and spirit so close to home! I'll be back. (You don't have to be a member, you can just drop in at $17 a class)

McDonald's is McDonald's. My "beef" with this place is they stopped selling ice and I prefer not to have to drive all over town in search of ice while wearing pajamas!   (See http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-restaurants-phoenix-44#hrid:jpfxQUBZMuBoIIFn-MWp7g)

This is my neighborhood Starbucks. Let's face it: Starbucks is the fast food of coffee. You are looking for consistency and efficiency and you get it here.   Even when the line stretches to the door the staff are smiling and friendly, moving through the orders as quickly as they can. And, despite the criticism that they're "corporate," those barristas know my name (and my drink), even when I don't remember theirs!   If I've been on a roll and coming in daily, they are courteous enough to start my drink even before I get to the register. When it's been a while, they remember my drink but check to make sure that's what I'm in the mood for on that visit.   They have started a rewards program where you can get a free drink for every 15 transactions or with a whole bean purchase, free refills on brewed coffee and tea and they won't charge you for (select) syrups and "milks." Plus you get a free drink for your birthday.   Another perk: I have Starbucks to thank for a lot of the more recent downloads on my iPod, thanks to the Pick of the Week. I grab one of those cards by the register whenever a new one is out and redeem the free download and I really have "discovered" new artists.

Whenever I have something to mail, this is where I come. Rarely a line, and never one longer than the post office, Moon Valley Postal Center is independently owned and operated with excellent customer service.   I especially like that any address I've mailed to before is in their system. I just give them the recipient's name and bada boom: there it is!   Most recently, my friend left her sun glasses case while visiting. I cruised in with the case and said, "What's the least expensive way to mail this without it being ruined on the way?" The guy behind the counter popped them in a box with some peanuts and away they went!  Mon Valley Postal makes sending stuff easy peasy!  (They're located on the north facing end of the strip mall, just around the corner from Blockbuster.)

I have been adopted by a cat. It's been in the 'hood for months. For the past few weeks it was bunking on my patio furniture at night and would run if I tried to get near, but this past week it started coming into my house for its slumber. So, I figured I best make sure the little guy's healthy (fortunately, it had already been neutered so I don't have to worry about the "multiplying like rabbits" phenomenon.). That's what made me think to review Dr. Stewart Cellers and Desert Hills Animal Hospital.   When you walk through the door at Desert Hills you are, most often, greeted by a lovely white-haired lady named Lynne. I will never forget her kindness when my cat, Sissy, was hospitalized there for a few days. Lynne took such great care nursing her, always willing to answer my call with a progress report. From her updates, it was clear she was really getting to know MY cat. And, when the end was near for Sissy, the staff at Desert Hills were so supportive and empathetic... taking turns comforting my kitty. I'm so grateful for them!   Dr. Cellers is very knowledgeable and willing to take time answering questions. He gives great detail but does not confuse with medical jargon. He explains ALL options, is honest , empathetic and doesn't push. And, when you call for updates or test results, he'll be the one to speak to you directly!   Office visits/exams are about $30 which, I think, is pretty reasonable. Today, we wound up doing an exam and a full panel of blood work on my yet-to-be-named addition (to make sure all organs are functioning properly, no FIV or feline leukemia, etc.) and it ran about $150.   I wouldn't even consider going some place else!

I'd been holding off on a review because I love this place so much and I didn't want to let the cat out of the bag and have the demand foil my ability to enjoy weekly wine tastings, but I think it's time to share the good news.   Cave Creek Wines has a great tasting/wine class on Fridays. They start at 6 p.m. and it's $10.   Here's what you need to know:  It's casual. The most popular question is often "what is the alcohol content in this?" If you get there too late for the sofas or tables, you will be seated in white plastic lawn furniture accompanied by TV trays.   They can only seat 45 people. The tasting starts at 6 but people start getting there as early as 4. Depending on what they're tasting it could be full before 5, certainly 5:30. You can find out what they're tasting by subscribing to their email blast or reading it here: http://cavecreekwines.com/discussion (You can also read about the other fun stuff they organize here).   Fair warning: There's no warm fuzzy apology or begging you to come back another time if you get turned away.   You can bring your own snacks and buy a bottle (or glass) to enjoy while you stake your claim to seats for the main event. There are quite a few regulars but they are welcoming and friendly. Don't be afraid to share your snacks with them.   Shortly before 6, Bob (of Bob & Lisa, the owners) will make an announcement that the food is ready. You can help yourself to bread, olive oil, cheese, grapes and, usually, some hot item like brisket, ravioli or meatballs. Though, sometimes it is a cold item like pasta salad.   Tasting starts promptly at 6. Make sure your cell phone is off and plan to pay attention or you'll get teased. Another warning: there will be a joke of some sort.   Usually it is a distributor doing the presentation. Sometimes, it's the actual winemaker.   Each of the 6 generous pours, (probably close to 2 oz. each) is introduced. You will learn something about the grape varietal, growing conditions, the winemaker, the region, the process... and, by tasting it and hearing the explanation so close together, over time, you will learn to discern what you like and why you like it! You can and should ask questions! That's how we all learn!!   Finish your pour before they come around with the next one. There's no waiting. You snooze you loose. And, for God's sake, it's not like it's a full glass - no dumping! If you don't like it, surely someone else near by will finish it -- at least offer! ;)   The wines that are tasted are 10% off that evening.   One last tip on how to find it: it's on the northeast corner of Cave Creek and Rose Garden. The first light north of the 101. It's behind the Shell station, and the most visible sign simply says "WINE" in red letters.   Seriously, it's a great value. I've been going for about 3 years. For about 2 of them, it was my Friday evening ritual. I learned a lot as a result. I'm grateful. I'm paying it forward...

Quick update to the wine tasting. The wine class now costs $20 per person but you receive a voucher for $10 valid that evening only on any bottle of wine.  All the featured wines are still 10% off. Seriously, even at $20 it's a great value.

I first discovered Integrity Heating and Cooling when my A/C broke last October. I found them on  Rosie on the House's referral list and was really impressed with the customer service. It felt like a small shop, where Shelby, who took my call also checked the work order when the service tech returned.   When I ultimately had to replace my A/C, I called around and got a few quotes from places referred by friends and coworkers. I wound up going with Integrity because I appreciated their responsiveness and their willingness to come darn close to matching another bid... AND gave a longer, better warranty. Plus, they had 0% financing.   I would absolutely recommend Integrity!

I've been to three car wash places in the vicinity and, of the 3, this is my favorite. In fact, the first time, I tipped the guy extra and told him "that's the best job a person has ever done on my car." I meant it too!   Today, I went back with a coupon and I didn't even need it. There was a special going on for $6.99 for the full service wash. You don't get an air freshener with this level, but I've paid a lot more for a lot less elsewhere.  With the silver and gold washes you do get air freshener but it's a small cardboard disk that you place under your seat. You get it when you pay, which is why they don't ask you what scent you want when you drop your car.   Like Danny's, you get a break on gas prices  and they pump it for you when you get a wash.   Truly, I usually leave these car wash places feeling frustrated and ripped off. I have yet to have that feeling here, and I hope I never do!

Staff was not knowledgeable nor helpful and there were the world's longest lines at the registers with no sign of intent to open more.  It was a very frustrating experience and a reminder of why I don't come here more often!

Fun, family-friendly, low-cost entertainment. Looking for something different to do? Why not spend $2-$4/hour wagering on horses? Sure, the return isn't huge at this rate -- a $2 bet to show may net you $1.10 (the most I've ever won is $12 on a $1 bet)-- but you've got a shot at earning enough winnings to cover your $4 beer and get more interactive entertainment than you will at a $12 movie!

Friday, I enjoyed a hike along the Holbert Trail to Dobbin's Lookout at the top of South Mountain.   The trail begins at the activity complex (all the ramadas when you make your first left turn immediately after entering the park on Central Avenue). I found it a little tricky to follow in the very beginning. I wound up walking along a sandy wash for a bit thinking "this can't be right." And, I was correct. But it could've been a rookie error - seems you just go straight from the trail head and ultimately veer to the left to stay on the trail.   The 2.5 mile hike is described as "difficult - fairly steep and long" with long being the operative word. I think North Mountain and Shaw Butte are much more steep.   Dobbin's Lookout is the highest point on South Mountain accessible by trail. At 2,300 feet, the view is probably the most rewarding of the Valley hikes I've done and, the difficulty level was just challenging enough to still enjoy.   Instead of thinking, "Phew! I did it. I can cross this off the list." I plan to be back!!

Worth checking out the view (and the slide) but everything -- from appetizers to drinks to entrees -- is drastically overpriced! If you have money to burn and are looking for kitsch, this is your spot. Otherwise, pick some place else...

I visited this Starbucks around 10 a.m. on the day after Christmas. It's a hot spot, evidently, as the drive thru line was long AND there was a line halfway to the door inside.   I chose to park and go inside. It was the slowest moving line I have seen at a Starbucks in a while. I ordered my drink "a tall nonfat latte, one pump gingerbread," which is how I was taught to order the drink at another location I visit occasionally because, I was told, they don't charge for one pump.   The girl behind the register put my drink in as a "nonfat gingerbread latte" and charged me for the $0.40 difference. When I attempted to correct my order, "I actually just want a latte with one pump gingerbread," her retort was "it's only like $0.20 difference."   WELL, Miss Moneybags, it's $0.40 different. And, because of your unwillingness to accept my order as placed, I paid you for additional pumps of syrup, whip cream and God knows what other goodies you put on top of a gingerbread latte... because, I certainly don't know... I only PAY for the crap, thanks to you, I don't actually take my drink that way!   So, yeah, "I have had better" and I don't think I will be back. I'll hit one of the 80-bajillion other locations within a .5 mile radius, next time I'm in the East Valley.

Only THE best brownie EVER! And, when I feel too guilty eating them myself, I turn into a food pusher and buy them as gifts for other people because they are so yummy! These are the kind of brownies you dream about... like literally. Not: you dream of ever finding a brownie like this. You ACTUALLY may have dreams about eating one! It's totally worth the drive to Gilbert (or you can order online and have them shipped if it's that much trouble for you) AND they offer a delicious brownie sundae where you pick any one of their 16 brownie flavors... they heat it up and top it with two scoops of ice cream plus the sundae topping of your choice. The sundaes are around $4. The chocolate macaroon frenzy is my personal fave! Brownie's by themselves are around $2.50. Watch the hours though: Pretty much "daytime" hours and they're closed on Sunday.

I picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint!   These are the richest, chocolatiest, moistest, biggest (3" square) brownies you will find!   I'm tellin' ya! TOTALLY worth the drive to Gilbert - except they're taking their own holiday break right now, so you'll have to wait until after Jan. 4, 2010 to get your fix! Still, worth the drive and worth the wait!!

I was meeting an out-of-town friend that I hadn't seen in 20 years at Kierland for dinner last Thursday and, since we hadn't decided exactly where we would dine at that evening, I suggested we meet at Bacchus for a wine appetizer and restaurant negotiations.   I was one of three other patrons when I walked in around 6 p.m. They were setting up for Bunco night, evidently.   The gentleman at the counter was friendly and helpful. He suggested a pinot and gave me a taste, when I asked for something a little more complex he came through with an excellent suggestion which I thoroughly enjoyed.  As my friend and I sat to catch up and nibbled on the mixed nuts that were delivered to our table, I expected to see a bunch of old ladies file in for Bunco (http://www.buncorules.com/rules.html)... turns out, this is where pretty young women who like bunco hang out! And, when I went to close out my tab I discovered a likely contributing factor: Thursday night is ladies night at Bacchus -- 2 for 1 glasses of wine or 10% off a bottle of wine ( & no corkage fee).   They also offer Wednesday night wine tastings and other events, which I plan to check out sometime... http://www.bacchusaz.com/events/

I went back for the Wednesday night wine class and had the pleasure of enjoying the company of Donald S. and the Beautiful Carin for my visit.   This event is informative and fun for singles, couples or small groups. $15 per person gets you generous pours, a bottle of water (to cleanse your palate) and a meat and cheese tray for the table.   Everyone tastes each wine at the same time and each wine is introduced by the distributor/representative who explains the terroir, process distinctions or  trivia about the wine maker.  A great opportunity to learn what you like and don't like about wine, but not pretentious. We were able to enjoy short conversations in between explanations.   Reservations are strongly suggested but can be made the day before the event, depending on the size of your group.

I had driven past this place for years and was reluctant to enter, but after reading Yelp reviews and seeing the posted photo of the interior (thank you Jason A.) my interest was peaked beyond what could be ignored.   I've since been twice and enjoyed it both times.   I think the best way to describe this place is that it is a bar that serves Chinese food. The food comes in Chinese take out boxes with plastic forks and styrofoam plates. The bar has limited table seating (unless you're willing to sit outside) and the walls and ceiling are adorned with (among other things) glass beads, starfish, cymbals and Chinese dragons. There's a breathalyzer machine in the corner.   Ordinarily, I would not pick Chinese food but after my first visit I longed to come back. Mostly for the atmosphere, but hey! Chop and Wok got me to pick a Chinese place. :) The food is not exceptional but I have never found Chinese food to be exceptional. The variety IS exceptional. More than 10 vegetarian options alone, even more if you are willing to eat shrimp!   Jamie has been behind the bar both times I've been there. The very first time he made me feel right at home by asking my name, shaking my hand and introducing himself as the owner. The second time, he generously made amends for a slow kitchen without even being prompted by complaints. The vibe is super chill and is a lot of what I love about Chop and Wok! Last night, some dude started playing guitar at the bar. He had an awesome voice and offered to take requests.   When you're feeling low key and hungry, this place is a great solution!

For our mom's birthday, my sister and I surprised her with a cooking class at Sweet Basil. Not because she needs lessons (my mom's a great cook) but because she enjoys cooking and it was something fun we could all do together.   Our class, Low Fat Faves, was $60 a person. Iced tea (really delicious tropical flavored, unsweetened tea that they sell loose at Sweet Basil) was available to quench our thirst while we listened to the instructor give an overview of each of the 7 recipes we would be preparing that evening.   With the review of each menu item, tips were given. For example, preheat the oven to 10 degrees hotter than what you need it, because the temperature drops when you open the door. Then lower it to the proper cooking temperature after you've put the food in to cook. Or, to more easily slice meat thin, put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes before slicing.   There were 15 participants in our class so we broke into teams of 2 (with one woman flying solo) and raised our hands to claim the recipe we wanted to work on during class. We donned our aprons and got to work.   Since Sweet Basil is a kitchen store, there were tons of tools to test drive! It was a lot of fun and about 30-40 minutes later, the instructor was pouring wine for us as we began our buffet dinner. There was a TON of food!   By the time we were finished, our family had to eat and run. Fortunately, because the class didn't start until 6:30, we had grabbed a "light bite" around 5:30. There was no way I could've waited until 9 p.m. to eat - and normally, I wouldn't eat that late at all. A weekend class would probably better fit with my schedule.   The recipes were OK but nothing really floored me. And, the tips were simple. Which was great for people with less time in the kitchen but I think it would also help to have offerings for more experienced cooks.   The instructor definitely was knowledgeable and I plan to keep my eyes peeled for class topics that interest me.   One last highlight: students get 10% off all gourmetware purchases the day of the class (excluding cookbooks, sale and electric items). I picked up a cool prep/cutting board!

This is the best Thai food in the Valley! I love the papaya salad and the gang ka ree (chicken and potato in a delicious yellow curry). Save room for the homemade coconut ice cream!! Granted, this is not a white-table-cloth-put-your-napkin-on-your-lap-for-you-water-glass-never-empty kind of place... it's consistent. It has to be: there are only two ladies who run/operate the place. One who cooks and one who takes your order (she's great at offering menu suggestions too!). I like it spicy, but I order it "medium-hot, but closer to medium" The hot is REALLY hot... the kind where the outside of your lips burn and it feels like the enamel is being scorched off your teeth... some people like it like that though... Truly, this place is worth the trip!

I still love this place and it maintains its rank as my favorite Thai place in the Valley.   A couple of helpful notes I wish I could do a better job remembering: they open for lunch, close for a break and then re-open for dinner, so you may want to call first to make sure they'll be open when you get there, if it's not normal lunch or dinner time; and, they are closed on Sunday.   The hospitality is genuine and unobtrusive. The Thai fried rice is really delicious -- Other than that, see my original review for more menu suggestions.

3.5 stars. Can't really fathom coming home from up north without putting off re-entry to the blazing heat by stopping for a piece of pie! Service is generally slow and the food is fairly average but the ambiance and the opportunity for pie with delicious crumb topping bring home the extra half star!

There's fantastic art to be seen here! Everything about this museum is great -- from the literal walls  (architecture) to the art within them!  I'm partial to tours, personally. I like to know a little more than the title and artist which can be read on the plaques. It helps me to hear some background about a piece to generate more curiosity about the work. I strongly recommend spending a little time exploring their website before you go to read up on the pieces. It really gives your appreciation of the art a whole different perspective.  The films and lectures are interesting -- learned a lot about Ansel Adams, for example. I especially enjoyed the Cezanne exhibition. Some of my favorites from the "regulars" are the Philip Curtis room and the conceptual work: Guillotine of Sunlight. Of course, everyone loves Yayoi Kusama's fantastic installation!   It's only $10 admission to begin with, but the admission fee is waived for a  donation on First Fridays from 6-10 pm and Wednesdays from 3-9 pm. And, those days they're open "late," otherwise, they close kinda early (5 p .m.)   Or, just join (I think it's $75) and support culture in Phoenix!

I wouldn't have been able to say "I've experienced better" right after my visit to Easley's, as I am not a costume shop regular, but I had been invited to a decade themed party to be thrown while I was vacationing in Austin and visited a second costume shop there.   I left Easley's disappointed because I had very little assistance while there and felt the quality of the costumes was somewhat weak. They didn't have items in my size and had no alternatives to suggest. I had expected costume shopping to be fun and imagined the shop workers would be creative and helpful with putting something together. After all, that would be what separated them from a thrift shop, right?   When that wasn't what I got at Easley's, I figured my expectations were too high, until I visited a shop in Austin and found it to be superior.   So, if I need a costume in Phoenix, I'll probably try Easley's again but I won't have real high hopes of finding what I am looking for or getting much help putting something together.

This place saved the day recently when we needed really, really big trash bags. None of the big boxes had them big enough (Home Depot, Lowes, etc.) and the event was hours away.   With a Hail Mary phone call, Maintenancemart saved the day! Not only did they have bags the size we needed, the guy encouraged me to bring in one of my receptacles to test it right there in the store, rather than take any chances. Fortunately, the bag fit. After ringing me up, he even carried the box out to my car for me! The customer service was top notch!  Other cool things: they have pretty much every cleaning supply you could imagine -- including those super-cool vacuum cleaners you wear like a jet-pack! there is an enormous plant growing into the rafters -- they'll let you take a snippet if you want to test your green thumb at home.  Helpful tip: the parking lot is NOT the first one you see when traveling south on 7th Ave. turn into the drive right after that...  :)

I was so disappointed by my lunch at Sacks today. It reminded me of a place in Albuquerque called Baggins... but they fell way short on customer service and quality.   While the patio was pretty full, there was no line and I was able to walk right up to the counter to order. No greeting. She took my order, no explanation. Although, I prompted by saying, "This is my first time here." Counterworker just stared blankly until I asked, "So do I wait here or do you call my name?"   The sandwich was fine: egg salad, cream cheese and bacon on multigrain bread. Not the best I've ever had. I ate half then turned to the bite sized cookie as my reward. It was hard as a rock! I didn't even finish the shard that I bit off.   I don't see any real reason to go back.

Best pita bread IN THE VALLEY! I crave the pita bread enough to make me order a salad (a basket of it comes as a side with a salad) and their Ranch dressing is tasty (Hidden Valley packet tasty).   My go-tos are: the goat cheese (with spring greens) or the gyro feta salad. Salads are around $10 but pretty filling.  Non-pita lovers can get burgers or pizza :)

WHY did I wait so long to come here? It's the best thing since sliced bread! (Sorry, couldn't resist the pun!)   Every kind of hot dog and hamburger bun imaginable. Bagels, English muffins, and Entemann's sweets!   Personally, I am a huge fan of the sandwich thins and bagel thins and, ordinarily, they're each $3+ at the grocery store. This place has them 2 for $3 AND you get a punch card for future purchases!   I totally expected the items to be day-old or very close to the "purchase by" date but not at all! Same as you'd find on the shelves of your local grocery store, far as I can tell!!  Seriously, bookmark this place and get your buns over here before your next camping trip or cookout! (Hehe! Sorry, another cheesy pun.)

I don't buy bread at the grocery store any more. I don't have to. This weekend I bought a package of sandwich thins, a package of "fill-ems" (like sandwich thins but hot dog bun shaped instead) and a package of bagel thins for $4.59 including tax. And, I got stamps towards a freebie when I fill my card. Here's the big deal: EACH of those items would retail for $3.50 at the grocery store.

Since Mr. K's excellent review, Underwraps has made a few changes. (Hey! Maybe they read your review?) You can now order salads (five types from Asian or Greek to Caesar or Cobb) and the sides to chose from include potato chips (which ROCK and are made in-house), potato salad or pasta salad (they scratched the fries).   The grilled vegetable wrap IS tasty: kalamata olives, grilled squash, roasted green peppers, red onion, lemon vinaigrette, but I also really like to do the scrambled egg (crispy bacon, caramelized onion, tomato and melted provolone cheese). They even make it egg whites only for me!  I do think a lot of their business is catering... and they've got some good offers. You can serve 11-14 people assorted wraps for just $50!   This place is close to where I work and it's not generally too crowded, so it's easy enough to get in and out. I'm gonna round up and give it four stars for taste and convenience!

WHY have I not gone here sooner? What a hidden gem! It is a used book store with rows and rows (and rows) of books of varied ages. I was looking for a specific book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs, and had a quick second to pop in on may way to an appointment.   There were so many books, I couldn't imagine it would be easy to find what I was looking for, but after a brief exchange which helped determine the book would be under "sociology" if they had it, we walked over to the clearly labeled row and began scanning the shelf by author.   There it was! One copy. Old, a little bit of underlining already, but only three bucks!   I can't wait to go back and snoop around see what other treasures lie on those shelves!  Here's the deal about bringing in books: you don't get cash for them but you do get half off in trade.

I've heard several Sweet Tomatoes have changed their format to be more a la cart. I am not remotely interested in the new format. I'm giving this Sweet Tomatoes 5 stars because they're the traditional all you can eat soup, salad, potatoes, pasta, flat breads, muffins and ice cream deal. They really are an example of Sweet Tomatoes' best format!  The chili, chicken noodle and ginger soups are my favorite.  The muffins and flat breads are yummy.  I like to put the soft serve on a chocolate muffin with caramel topping and chopped nuts but when they have the healthier, fat-free chocolate mouse, it's so delish, I will actually get that instead!  The prize for the buffet is very reasonable. (Drinks are like $3 though!)

After the VYE at Desert Mission Food Bank, many of the Yelpers stuck around to grab brunch someplace in Sunnyslope. While there were a lot of options to chose from, I'm proud my fellow Yelpers decided to try a place that had yet to be reviewed: The Eye Opener Family Restaurant (formerly Tom & Tiny's).   This Phoenix family-owned diner is open 7 days a week from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. for breakfast and lunch and is a morning ritual for many of Sunnyslope's longtime residents. One of my favorite things about Sunnyslope is the small town feel with access to all the urban amenities of Phoenix. Places like the Eye Opener feed that sense of place. Hal (the owner) is a kind man who loves what he does, is liable to come by your table himself to fill your coffee cup and make sure everything is OK . It is evident that he views his customers as extended family.   Here are some of the things I like to eat at the Eye Opener:  Standard eggs, toast and hash brown breakfast   the Chef omelet - egg whites only (filled with yummy things like ham and green chili and topped with cheese)  Gyro (the tzasiki sauce is delicious and is flavored with dill!)  It's not on the menu, but Hal makes his own hummus and it's just delicious!!

I'm ashamed to share that my 10-year old bike still has the hair on the tires, AND the tires were flat from having been in my storage shed for 6 years. Figured it was a good idea to get a tune up (and a helmet) before trying to ride again!   The shop owner was so nice! $40 for the tune up and even though it was going to be ready later that day, he advised I leave it a bit to make sure the tires didn't need a new tube (they didn't).   He patiently showed me how to put the bike rack on my car - even though I didn't buy it from him, I just brought it from home.   He didn't try to sell me the most expensive option of the accessories and in the end, I got a tune up, a helmet, a bike lock and a headlight for $128 (including tax).   He taught me about the gears on my bike and gave me a map of all the bike paths in Phoenix! All the while, charming banter. I feel like I've made a new friend!   Not only can you buy bicycles and any accessory you may need for your bike at this little shop on Hatcher Road, I understand you can rent bikes here too; and, the shop is right by the canal so if you don't already own a bike but feel like riding, this would be a great launching point.   Of course, I SAY that... let's see if I actually get on mine now...

Karl's has delicious bakery items. I love to look at the seasonal cookies (they are not as sweet as they look - more like shortbread "sweet.") and the eclairs and almond horns are great! But, you'd expect that from a bakery.   Here's my hot tip: you can buy whole, half or 1/4 quiche there. And they are awesome and reasonably priced. The crust is irresistible! (Literally. I always tell myself I'm not going to eat the crust -- under other circumstances I can take it or leave it -- but I just can't say no to this crust!)

10-inches of hard crust Italian bread stuffed with ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella (hold the pepperoni), provolone, hot peppers, lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian dressing. Heaven. Great deal at only $7.95! Waaay to much sandwich for one person for lunch.   They have a lovely pastry case filled with Italian cookies, cannoli shells (and cannoli, but I prefer to make my own filling - viva Sambuca and chocolate chips!) and sfogliatelle.   Aisles and aisles of canned, jarred, boxed and bagged Italian pantry essentials (and they're not covered in dust like some other places).   Keep an eye on the prices. Some are fair - Polly-O brand is hard to come by in the Valley but others are practical extortion! ($20 for Illy espresso!!?)

I can't stand shopping here. Seriously! The check out line is ridiculous (and with all the candy and beef jerky they force you to stand next to in hopes of an impulse buy, you'd THINK you'd be able to find grab and go items like jump drives... alas, not when I was there.) Almost as ridiculous as the exchange/return process. The staff we talked to seemed to lack product  knowledge. I will NOT be back.

After years of acryllic and then gel nails, I gave them up in favor of my natural nail but I missed the way the polish lasted. I noticed my nails seemed healthier than ever though, and that in itself was worth more frequent manicures and polish changes.   Still, to have a chip days --if not hours-- after investing in a manicure was excruciatingly frustrating! So, I caved and tried this "new" gel polish. Sure it lasted but I found myself picking full petals of polish off my nails a maximum of 2-weeks to the day of each manicure (also not good for my nail health).   If the peeling wasn't an issue, then the damage done too my poor, brittle nails during the polish change was! Inevitably, I'd have rips, snags and tears. I gave up. Again.  Until one day I saw Deanna post about this steam removal technique and talking about how committed she was to offering the best quality, cutting edge technology to her customers and i thought, "I can trust Deanna with my nails."  I really can't imagine finding a better manicurist! Her professionalism is exceptional as is the quality of her work. After only 2 manicures with Deanna my nails are already quickly regaining health and manicures are easily lasting 3 weeks.   I look forward to securing my spot in the "regulars" appointment rotation! :)

While I can't say I will never go back, because the food WAS good; I CAN say: I will go someplace else if there's a wait because while it was at least 30 minutes before we got seated it was 45 before our food arrived.   Truly: I think it had to do with the fact that 3 very large (for the small venue and kitchen) tables were seated immediately before us, but that does not excuse that fact that 45 minutes on top of a 30 minute wait is an unreasonable amout of time to go without so much as a "The kitchen's a little backed up right now. Thank you for your patience." Which, in itself would have been an understatement.   Top that with the employees showing up with the original wait list to correct my statement that we had been there for "2 hours," when I asked how much longer our food would be. It had only been an hour and a half. My bad.  Those jalapeno pecan pancakes are frickin' awesome though...

I enjoyed a meal here this past Saturday with two girl friends and I have to tell you: THE best barbecue sauce I have had in my life!   I am talking about the cherry barbecue sauce that comes on the side with the short ribs (which were pretty dry on their own). I am somewhat embarrassed to share that I was plucking the cherries from the sauce and eating them straight!   The short rib was served on cheesy grits and while usually the texture of grits doesn't work for me, these were pretty good. I credit the abundance of cheese with altering the texture.   Dessert was also delicious: the cuppa red hot chocolate is a mug filled with two layers of dense chocolate mousse at least one of which is laced with chile that inspires a cinnamon red hot-like burn in the very back of your palette on the finish. Definitely a desert to be shared. We also split the peanut butter mousse dessert which was in a chocolate cookie shell and was much less dense - in fact, it was runny and spilled out of the sides when the shell broke but the peanut butter flavor was perfect and it was accompanied by 3 chocolate covered peanut butter cookie dough balls. One for each of us -- we didn't even have to fight over them!   Other great things warranting these stars? We were able to walk in on Saturday night and get a table; the wine list is extensive and includes very accessible options; the portions are huge and the price is moderate - more than a fair deal for the quality of food.

I had figured the "Poisoned Pen A Mystery Book Store" only offered mysteries; so, while I thought it was a cool idea, it wasn't really on my radar for much else.   Recently, I went to support a friend of a friend who was having a book signing. Turns out their specialty is fiction--mysteries and thrillers, plus general fiction, science fiction/fantasy and historical fiction but you can also find works related to history, travel, and food.   In fact, they can order pretty much anything you want to read and will call you to pay for it and pick it up when it arrives, a service I took advantage of, figuring how much we all should be "shopping local" versus supporting some internet "big box" equivalent.   There's a lot more going on at Poisoned Pen than what you might find in other book stores. For starters, they have an interesting (and large) collection of signed first editions. There are no less than 8 book clubs plus a variety of book signings, conferences and workshops on the calendar each month.   And, my favorite: a special touch. while paying for the book they had ordered for me, I was asked if I wanted it covered. I was confused by the term. I've never had anyone ask me if I wanted my book "covered" before.   A bag? Yes. "Covered"? No.   My confused look prompted the explanation, "it will help protect it." How could I say no? And, they carefully wrapped my new hardbound book in a clear plastic jacket -- gratis!

Wow! What a disappointment! I remember going to Don & Charlie's for an elite event a few years ago and especially loving the creme brulee because there was a rich chocolate layer that gave you the sense the entire dish was built on a hershey's bar!   We came to Don & Charlies last week as a part of our Steak Out (search for the best steak in the Valley) --I recommended it with dessert in mind! -- and within 3 bites, we could confidently say this was not it!   My tomato soup was good but that's about the only nice thing I can say about this visit!  Overall, the experience failed to meet expectations.  My fillet was barely seasoned and was cooked to medium well, despite being ordered medium. We discussed sharing our disappointment with the waitress but we noticed others weren't sending food back, so we figured it was common practice for the kitchen.  The cheesy bread appetizer (complimentary with check in) took forever to arrive, so by the time it did I had had my fill of bread from the standard issue basket.  There was nothing notable about the creamed spinach.  The chocolate at the bottom of my creme brulee more closely resembled a faint layer of chocolate pudding than the rich, chocolatey hershey's bar I remembered.  Sadly, I'm in no rush to go back.

This is one of my top two favorite traditional pizza places in Valley. I am partial to ricotta and salami or ricotta and breaded eggplant for toppings. The crust is thin enough to fold but thick enough to have some chew to it.   And, whatever you do: start with the spinach artichoke dip! (It really could/should be a meal in itself but is sure to at least become a standard kick off for your table.)

Chef's Table was a stitch! I sound like an old lady using that descriptor and I suppose, to many, I am -- but what modern word best includes captivating and amusing?   Anyway, thanks to Samantha O.'s advice, I made a reservation for the Chef's Table, which basically means you sit at a bar top that faces the kitchen area where you are greeted by the chef who is swirling his frothy Glenlivet, personable and cheerful and cranking out items to dazzle palates.   He'll ask if you have any foods you can't eat and then he'll just start plopping plates in front of you. One course at a time. Mostly small plates. $10 per course. Cry uncle when you want him to stop. You can also take a break. Don't miss the impressive dessert sampler - be sure to save room.   House wines are fantastic!   Totally worthwhile experience!!  P.S. Thanks for the pointer, Samantha O. You're my hero! :)

I have attended Mass at the Franciscan Renewal Center, or "The Casa" as we like to call it, since moving to Arizona in 2002. The church is not a part of the Phoenix Diocese but is a Catholic conventual church owned an operated the the Franciscans of Santa Barbara.   The Kachina Lodge resort until purchased by the Friars in 1951, Casa grounds are absolutely breathtaking and offer traditional Catholic respite, like a beautiful cylindrical chapel where the sacred Eucharist is kept and visitors can pray quietly, as well as a labyrinth, healing garden, guest rooms and swimming pool. In fact, the retreat center is available to non-Catholic -- non-Christian even -- groups for events. They really mean it when they say "all are welcome."   My favorite time of year is Holy Week (the holidays leading up to and including Easter) when the church community come together for a touching communal washing of the feet, adoration of the Eucharist, a theatrical retelling of the Stations of the Cross, a compelling Good Friday and the best Easter Vigil you could ever experience.   Father Bill, a regular visiting priest, often gets the crowd to do the wave on Eater Sunday and Renee, one of the guest singers gets people dancing in their seats! Not your traditional Catholic church experience in large part due to the music ministry.   This is the place to go to experience God as Love and I am so grateful to have it as a haven for recharging each week!  (I should share that Sunday Mass is at 7:30 a.m., 9:15 a.m., 11 a.m. and 7 p.m.)

I really like Papago for the variety - 30 beers on tap and God knows how many in the refrigerator cases. All can be consumed on-site or brought home to stock your personal inventory.   What I especially dig is how knowledgeable the staff are about the beer -- even the ones who barely look old enough to drink! I've learned a lot already, from the different types of beer glasses to how some beers are aged and discovering what I like!   You can play darts or any of the many board games they've got out. We played Yahtzee on one recent visit. There's a jukebox and a TV for further distraction.   The food is OK. Nothing spectacular. Ball park pretzels, thin pizza crust with sauces for dipping, quesadillas, pizzas, etc. There are severely limited options for non-beer drinkers (like 4-5 mediocre wines to chose from and canned/bottled sodas).   That said, if you're willing to explore the world of beer - this HAS to be your first stop!

Five stars for the ooey gooey butter cake alone. Even if everything else at this place sucked (fortunately, it doesn't), that cake would merit 5 stars. I woke up thinking about it this morning!  The toasted ravioli was good and the sauce for dipping had a nice bite. The wine list had some good selections at reasonable prices including Rombauer merlot for $40.  Didn't even get to try dinner yet... will I need a sixth star?

Only a little bit divey, this place has really good food! I have to admit, I've been known to walk over from Papago just to get some dinner.  So far, it seems I stick to the starter menu. Some of my favorites are the nachos ($6.95) which leads me to think the English Beer Cheese dip must be worth ordering -- note to self for next time! The mac n cheese ($3.95) is awesome and a bargain!   There's a ton of delicious sounding items on the rest of the menu -- maybe someday I'll get past the starters and have a green chile burger or test the fish and chips. Heck, typing this I'm thinking of how much I dig this place and wondering why I don't go more often...  maybe working my way through the menu as a service to my fellow Yelpers could be a good excuse.  :)

I'm still a big fan of the mac n cheese. Quite possibly the best in the Valley! Cheesy enough that you may have to twirl your fork when you grab a bite of the tangy, creamy goodness!   I like the batter on the fish and chips but found the fish to on the tough side -- not my favorite.

It's almost not fair to describe a specific meal here because the menu changes and you cannot be assured to find whatever is described; you CAN, however, be assured of finding subtle-yet-dramatic presentation and an outstanding meal.   I've had wonderful short ribs; fantastic duck; sweet scallops; tried Jerusalem artichokes for the first time in a lovely soup; had to-die-for desserts and phenomenal cheese plates.   The venue is small and, although attached to a brightly lit wine shop (that now sells some super cool cheeses too), offers an intimate, romantic dinning space.   This place is in my top 5.   Heck! Top 3.   I can't imagine turning down a chance to go here!

2.5 stars...   Great shows come through here, the building is cool to look at in a retro way and the seating is roomy, as mentioned in previous reviews.   But...   The parking lot SUCKS: if at ALL possible, find a parking space you can back into (if not possible, figure out a way to back into the space anyway); there is such thing as a "bad" seat here and the acoustics are good for music but not voices.

As a part of the Steak Out, our most recent visit was to this Valley favorite.   For sure: KILLER shrimp cocktail. Although there were only 4 pieces, they give new meaning to the phrase Jumbo Shrimp and, despite their size, they were not tough or iodine-y. The flavor was fresh and the cocktail sauce could clear the very worst sinuses!  The roasted garlic mashed potatoes must use REAL roasted garlic -- like, roasted in house, not just minced garlic tossed in! The sweet, earthy flavor was subtle which was perfect, because it didn't destroy your palate for the rest of the plate.  I was surprised by the wine list: not a huge. very accessible, relatively speaking.  But, we're on a quest for the best steak. This one? It gets very high marks!  Excellent seasoning on the meat. Preparation in terms of temperature was adequate (although, it was more on the medium rare side; I would argue that is the side to err on!).

Chino Bandido is my guilty pleasure. It is utterly unhealthy food served in an aluminum foil bowl, delivered by a casually dressed employee who shouts your name until you claim it. And, you get a soft snickerdoodle cookie, as if there were not enough calories and carbs in the meal itself.  It's a dive. Black and white checkered floors. Murals and polaroids of customers mounted on the walls behind plastic.  Ayesha is right. It's a love/hate kind of place; and, those who love it will blurt out what they order at the mere mention - it's practically involuntary.   Me? I'm "jerk chicken add black beans." I have the number programmed into my phone so I can call in my order.  It's also addictive for those who like it. I am generally compelled to visit Chino within 72 hours of hearing someone mention it.  Here's the thing about Chino Bandido: it is NOT Chinese and it is NOT Mexican. It is Chino Bandido. It's its own animal.   To try to label it can only lead to disappointment. So, I suggest:  ~ Know that we are not talking fast food prices -- a one item bowl with a soft drink is $9.15. ~ Enter with an open mind.  ~ Proceed immediately to the counter under the menu with all the pictures on it and tell the employee it's your first time. The employee will slip you a bunch of samples so you can taste what you're in for.  ~ Figure out what you like and accept help from the employee while you complete the unique order form (which is also demonstrated on the website: http://www.chinobandido.com/order.html). ~ Enjoy!

Yelp's noting my check-ins here and asking what keeps me coming back.   What keeps me coming back?  The burrata. A meal in itself. A perfect dish to share in such a romantic setting...smear some of the creamy, milky burrata on a toast piece and top with delicate prosciutto and chase it with super-garlicky, perfectly acidic, tiny tomatoes.  The crust. Perfectly chewy crust delivers the pizza toppings of your choice. Red or white: you can't go wrong!  The ambiance. This place has such charm! I love the setting; whether on the patio or inside, it's the kind of place you could linger and solve the world's problems over a bottle of wine and course after course of delicious food!

OK. Fine. I'm reviewing FEZ. I've been waiting because, really, what could I add that the 294 reviewers who came before me didn't already say?   And, frankly, I wondered if my adoration of Thomas S. was clouding my judgment. I considered withholding one star that would otherwise go for Thomas because he is, quite likely, THE best GM/host in the Valley!   Because of Thomas (and, let's face it, some great drink specials), FEZ is one of my favorite go-to spots for a group event. Thomas always ups the ante with some spectacular generous host treat -- sometimes even prizes! But, see... this is what I was afraid of. I was worried my review would be dominated by my affection for Thomas.   Suffice to say: he is wonderful, gifted at his work and FEZ is lucky to have him.   NOW. I mentioned the good drink specials at FEZ. My favorite are $3 Martini Tuesdays. I'd love to work my way through the menu, trying a new flavor each week. It's hard for me to deviate from the cherry bomb though. I love it! The apricot margarita and the apricot chardonnay fussion are also up there.   I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes, so I don't share everyone's appreciation of the sweet potato fries. I DO, however, favor the spicy harissa ones. I have no idea what spicy harissa is but it's spicy. And good.   What else is great about FEZ is they are always trying something new! Chef specials, guest appreciation specials, FEZ Foodie events, new and varried menu items... There are staples you can count on (I like the pesto Caesar with pistachios add shrimp, the bleu cheese balsamic burger and the lamb or shrimp kisra) but options are forever evolving and worth scanning the menu and asking about specials each visit!   Here's what compelled me to write FEZ' 295 review: thanks to Audrey and Jim W., last night I discovered FEZ has a $3 burger on Mondays!! (you can add your choice of fries for $2!) I got a burger, fries and 2 margaritas for like $11!!   Seriously, it was delicious and a deal! So, I'm caving. I'm writing this review and declaring my appreciation for FEZ and admitting that it's not just because Thomas S. is awesome. Thomas S. AND FEZ are awesome!! xoxo

Buy one entree get one for $4 - this was their brilliant July 4th promo. I hadn't been to Chelsea's in years - spent a nice New Years Eve there a few years back. Turns out Chelsea's is batting 1000 for holidays!   This time, we took a Yelp tip and walked to the bat cave as pre-dinner entertainment. Checking in for our 8:15 appointment shortly after 8 p.m., I got a little nervous when the hostess suggested we would be seated in 15-25 minutes - that they "try to seat reservations within 15 minutes of their reservation time." We got seated promptly at 8:15.  I had remembered loving the ceviche and it was as delicious as I recalled.   Went with the fish special which was cooked perfectly and in a delicious simple Asian sauce. Believe it or not, I was given a list of ingredients when I asked for a recipe! How generous!  Unfortunately, they had run out of the Dixie chicken so one of my dinning companions had to settle for the rotisserie chicken which, while edible, was disappointingly dry.  I tasted a corn tortilla that was PERFECT! Had a nice stretch like a fresh flour tortilla but the hearty flavor unique to corn tortillas. While I didn't taste, I saw the lobster taco serving and was impressed with the portion.   Dessert was a flourless chocolate cake described precisely by our server as having the taste of "brownie batter" with pistachio gelato.   A single pitcher of house (white) sangria kept our table of 4 quenched.   The ambiance is homey yet elegant. I look forward to my next visit!

I had driven by Padre's so many times... and, truly, never even gave it much thought. But, my friend Tiffany had been talking about how much she enjoyed the band that performed there, and that they were doing a 3 Amigos tequila tasting... so we settled upon Padre's for a late dinner last night. I'm so glad we did!!  It was everything Tiffany had said and more! I'm a big fan of carne adovada (grew up in New Mexico) and theirs was the best I've had in a long, long time! Cubes of pork marinated and slow roasted in red chile... It was so tender, it was hard to stab it with your fork and when you did what a reward for your mouth! It just melts! The chile was good (although, I prefer it a little hotter). The portion was generous: a flour tortilla prepares the plate for a heap of the adovada, some ranch style beans and a bit of rice.  I have a feeling I'm going to be craving that again very soon... thank goodness for left overs! (Maybe breakfast?)

It had been at least a year, possibly closer to two, since my last visit to Padre's and I was worried that rumors of a new chef and changes in the kitchen may have made my earlier comments null and void.  I am pleased to announce that I had the carne adovada again today and it was just as tender as I remembered it. In fact, I stand behind my original review 100% -- the chile could be a little spicier, but the meat is perfectly marinated and fork tender! Delish!

What makes Little Saigon so special is the quality of the ingredients. The meats are lean, the veggies are fresh. I am a huge fan of Vietnamese fresh spring rolls, which are not baked or fried. Filled with rice noodles, shrimp and pork these are a refreshing starter for any meal... they can be a meal on their own! I like the bahn xeo (which reminds me of a thin fritatta filled with bean sprouts). The pho is great with all white meat chicken (and I kick it up a notch with the hot sauce and hoisen which are already on the table)! When I'm not in the mood for soup, I like to get the vermicelli dishes and have tried most of them over the course of the past two years. Satisfied every time! This is a great spot for dinner before Glendale Glitters or any of the many other festivals that take place in downtown Glendale.

Bobby Qs has worked its way into the rotation and not just for the warm, delicious mini-donuts they give you at the end of your meal. I love the corn. The mac and cheese is rich and creamy and super cheesey! The brisket is tender and generally lean. The ribs fall. right. off. the. bone! Like, seriously! I don't generally eat ribs because I'm not into gnawing meat off the bone, but I can eat these ribs with my fork! I like the kick to the spicy BBQ sauce. The portions are generous and on Sundays you can get enough food for 3-4 people easy for under $30! (see my pic: http://bit.ly/HbzA9R)

The price of that Sunday special is now under $40 but it's still a value!  Bobby Q is still a regular for our household. We LOVE the ribs which fall off the bone as you pick them up from the plate, the mac and cheese which has a mild tang and the sweet, buttery corn.   Even if you don't go on Sunday, Bobby Q offers some great family-size platters at a reasonable price in a fun atmosphere.

I used to really like Ticoz -- like 3-4 years ago. In fact, I'm surprised I hadn't already reviewed it! Loved the drinks and had two favorite entrees: the grilled burrito with fish and the coconut curry rice with chicken. Both are still on the menu and neither are as delicious as they once were. In fact, they're both kinda gross now! :(  The grilled fish burrito contains breaded fish and the breading texture is mushy inside the burrito. The flavor is weak.  The rice is skimpy on the chicken and you are given the option of if you want it spicy or not. It used to just have a nice mild spice to it. Now? Now, it is sweet! Blech! And, if you make it spicy, it's still more sweet than spicy.  Sorry to say, I'm in NO rush to go back.  :(

Man! I was excited to see Flo's as an option while waiting for a flight recently. Sadly, it was no better than a Panda Express would've been. $11 and a rice bowl later, I was left wishing I stopped someplace else.

I have yet to find a bad seat here. Even the $25 Cardinals game tickets are reasonable, though who wouldn't prefer to be in the $75 seats?   That said, food and drink pricing is beyond ridiculous! Do NOT come hungry! (or thirsty...) We're talking $7.25 for a bottle of Bud Light or $5 for a churro. Yikes!!

Probably my favorite breakfast spot. Depending on my mood, this is how it's done, eggs are either over easy or poached: Shrimp enchiladas -- red and green chile Huevos Rancheros  -- red and green chile Carne Adovada  -- red only   Lately, it's been a lot of enchilada, though I feel the huevos rancheros starting a resurgence!  Breakfast entrees are about $10 -12 and worth every penny.

This is one of my favorite places!   The portions are HUGE and, as you can see from the images posted, the menu is too! Pretty much everything has a Mediterranean ingredient of some sort: shrimp, eggplant, artichoke, lamb, feta, garlic, tomatoes, olives... what's not to love!?  Personally, I stick with appetizers: the Spicy Lamb Potatoes, which I like to call "lamb balls" because it makes me giggle... these large egg shaped croquettes of potato, gyros meat, herbs and spices are served with yogurt sauce. They are so big, I usually wind up bringing 2 or 3 home! PLUS, I have a plan: I have to save room for dessert because the baklava cheesecake is fricking AWESOME!!! (so is the caramel cheesecake)   I still want to try the wine pairing dinners. They're held monthly on a Monday and at $45, seem to be a steal! Looks like they pick a label and build a four course meal around it! Check out some of the past menus: http://www.eurocafe.com/calendar.html

The. Best. Pretzel bun! 1/2 priced burgers on weekends! The tap beer selection has improved. Yep, I'm a fan!  PS I never noticed the "detail" in the artwork that reinforces the Half Moon name, until someone broke it down for me. Now, I can't miss it and I think it's BRILLIANT! :)

Had another great lunch at Corbin's today. Couldn't decide between the vegetarian cheese sandwich and the pulled pork... so I compromised: went with the cheese sandwich (sliced tomato, fresh asparagus, red bell pepper, cheddar, Swiss AND queso fresco grilled on sourdough) and fries to dip in a side of BBQ sauce. The asparagus was perfect -- still had a crunch! I sat at the bar, which was just a plain-ole cruel thing to do to myself in the middle of a work day. I swear the Pimm's was staring at me! (Look for me there at 5:03!)  After 4 years of dining at Corbin's here are some of my favorites: Their quesadillas are open faced (kinda like a lavosh pizza). Huge, too. At least two people could share one. The Southwestern Pork one is out of this world!  Best salad option: Club Salad - Field greens, grilled chicken, tasso ham (a hot-smoked Cajun specialty that's got a cayenne and garlic kick), crumbled blue, hard cooked egg, tomato & avocado.   When I'm craving a burger I go for the Carolina Burger: apple-smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, red onion and that awesome house-made BBQ sauce!  It's a tie on the chicken sandwiches: Buffalo Chicken Sandwich - GRILLED chicken breast, wing sauce, sautéed celery and blue cheese dressing or the New Orleans Club, a breast of chicken topped with Swiss, tasso ham, tomato, red onion and real mayonnaise. (I can't get enough of that ham!!)   Truly, it's tough to go wrong at Corbin's. This place is at the top of my list!

Have been enjoying Happy Hour at Corbin's lately -- the fish tacos are really good (I'm totally serious). Soon enough it will be too hot to enjoy the patio but recently, I've seen some pretty cool cars in the parking lot or cruising Central -- an Aston Martin, restored Novas and Mustangs - I love to take in the eclectic diversity of Sunnyslope visible from the patio of Corbin's!

The warm pound cake is so awesome it should be on the brunch menu! I'm totally not kidding. You know those mornings when you want cake for breakfast? This one would be just right!!   The brownie is good too. But, not for breakfast. ;)

A friend of mine met MT who plays guitar here on Friday and Saturday nights and wanted to hear him play, so I agreed to accompany her to VinciTorio's this past Saturday. She pitched it as a "deli" so I totally did not expect table linens and homemade orecchiette! Turns out the chef is from the same region in Italy as my maternal grandmother (Puglia). I remember making orecchiette with her when I was a little girl. It's one of my favorites, so of course I had to chose that for my entree.   Orecchiette ("Priest Ears" or "Little Ears") are little hat or ear shaped pasta that do a fabulous job of storing sauce. I have not yet tried the red sauce at VinciTorio's (part of the reason I can't commit to five full stars) since this orecchiette was topped with olive oil, garlic, broccolini, ground sausage and pecorino cheese.  It was delicious!    Entree prices ranged from $12-20 and come with soup or salad. The wine list had some good selections. I especially liked the pinot nero "Terre di Gioia" which was only $7/glass! (I also had the panna cotta for dessert. It was good, but a little too heavy on the raspberry puree.)   And, we got to enjoy all of this with live acoustic guitar renditions of classic Eagles and Tom Petty... not what you expect to hear on the streets of Monopoli, but easy on the ears, anyway! Based on their web site, it looks like they host some pretty cool events... like the upcoming Italian dinner and a movie night.  I'm looking forward to returning and trying some sauce to make a final assessment; although, by the crowd of people waiting in the parking lot when we left, I'm guessing it's pretty good!

Blech! The ONLY redeeming quality of this place is that  they play the school's fight song throughout the game, if there is an alumni group watching. Combined with menu items named for teams that call the Upper Deck "home," it's easy to find school spirit.  That said: the food is "meh" -- the "big ass burrito" is the size of a microwavable burrito you may find in any middle school. The quality is about the same.  Service is mediocre.  NO real drink specials during big games is the icing on the cake.  Definitely not my first choice and I plan to find a different place to watch next season.

Definitely a fan! It's so not what you would expect from just driving by... Heck, they have beef wellington on the menu!!  So far, I have only been for happy hour (twice) but it's a good one! The drink prices are great. As far as food, I've had the potato skins, fried zucchini (each $4 during happy hour) and the tenderloin toasts and spanikopita. The spanikopita was delicious! 5 small triangles packed with spinach, but what was most notable was the freakishly buttery taste to to the phyllo! And, by "freakishly buttery" I mean... AWESOME! The tenderloin toasts were great too. The bread was sliced thin enough that it didn't cut up the top of your mouth despite being crisp yet was sturdy enough not to crumble into pieces when you took a bite. The meat was tender and still pink. Packed with flavor!   Talk about a neighborhood place. Went by today around 3:15 but they don't open until 4. Thought it was weird no one was behind the bar when I walked in, and it took a while for someone to come from the kitchen. The customer service was spectacular! First, he asked what he could get me, then he explained they weren't open for another hour so he'd be back in the kitchen getting stuff ready and invited me to just holler if I needed anything. And, still, he kept coming out to check on us offering to take a food order as soon as the kitchen was ready.   Yay, Frank! You took great care of us. Thank you so much!! I'd totally recommend Feeney's!

Monday nights you get a sirloin burger and fries for $4 -- awesome deal. Good burger. Add cheese, avocado, bacon, mushrooms, etc. for a small up charge. Get all you can eat (simple) salad bar for an additional $2.75. TVs with Monday night football in the bar and on the patio -- great, chill Monday night option.

Good happy hour and now open for LUNCH!! (11:30 - 2ish)   I went for lunch today and you get quite a bit of food... loads of lunch specials to choose from!  I went with the roll trio (had to pay $1/roll extra for soy paper, which is not unusual -- I HATE Norri, bleck!). It came with a small iceberg and tomato salad topped with fried onion and a delicious tangy, sesame dressing and a bowl of miso (due to my Norri aversion, this was wasted on me) In the end, my three fair-sized, cone-shaped rolls and a diet coke ran me around $15.   Next time, I'll take a picture! ;)

Wow! The portions here are way more generous than I had expected.   Not to sound like a total cheapskate but the prices had scared me off of Fuego Bistro for a long time. The menu sounded great and I came for lunch and LOVED my Cuban sandwich - A LOT - but dinner seemed steep.   Came for happy hour and had a top notch mojito and enjoyed delicious sliders. Still, for dinner... I wasn't convinced.   I saw a Groupon but the conditions (must buy 2 entrees) didn't earn any points for me, personally. My friend, however, had a Groupon and suggested we meet here for dinner.   Holy mole! The dinner portions are HUGE. No wonder the prices are what they are. You can easily share an entree - or take home left overs. There must've been a dozen shrimp on my plate. MOUNDS of pork on the other. You get to choose 2 sides and they're all wonderful.   So, to put an end to this long story... do NOT let the dinner prices scare you off. The food is delicious and you get your money's worth, not just in the quality but in the quantity too!

North Mountain has a lot to do with why I live where I live. Moving to Phoenix from a much more urban environment (DC area), I wanted to live some place I could walk a lot. Of course, it had been a while since I had been to Phoenix in the summer - and forgot I would NOT want to have to walk in the heat of most months! Phoenix isn't especially pedestrian, probably mostly because of that heat.   North Mountain is where I walk.   It's centrally located and the North Mountain National Trail 44 is a short, steep, paved hike, excellent for daily exercise. (There's a little shade in the mornings and late afternoons, if only I could wake up early enough to make it up there before work during the summer!)   The trail, which begins at the Maricopa picnic area, is 1.6 miles round trip and while most of it is paved, the part that isn't is challenging enough to keep it interesting. Along the way, you'll gain 650 feet in elevation, giving you plenty of time to get your heart rate up, depending on how hard you exert yourself. Walking still does it for me. Some people go up and down several times. The folks who run it amaze me. I don't even hope to ever be that fit! :)   Along the way, you can catch a glimpse of the Cardinal's stadium waaaay out in the West Valley and at the summit (2,104 feet), you can enjoy a panoramic view of the entire Valley.   Most people hike to the summit and return the way they came; however, the trail is actually a loop and there is much less traffic and a more rugged hiking experience if you continue south and complete the loop.   I can't wait for it to cool off so I can get back at it! Maybe I'll try to set the alarm a little earlier and see if I can pull it off... Maybe.

There is little, if anything, that can be said about Binkley's that hasn't already. The attention to detail by everyone from the front of the house to the back is impeccable. The experience is dramatic and entertaining, though the ambiance is casual and relaxed.   The kitchen is successful on so many levels: the presentation ranges from darling to decadent and even the tiniest morsel provides LAYERS of flavor. The mini slider(s) are my all-time favorite because they exemplify this. I'm not kidding. We're not just talking "packing a flavor punch," here... it's LAYERS of flavor in ONE tiny bite!!  An embarrassing kicker: while always interested in seeing what the hype was about, I was reluctant to spend my *own* money on dinner at Binkley's... finally, a dear friend gifted me with dinner for my birthday. Let me just say: It is worth. every. penny! Not only would (and HAVE) I spent my own money on it since, but I would consider giving it as a gift!

It's like I have to psych myself up to go to Nick's every time, because I forget how much I love it but last night, I had to personally thank the owner for serving quality food at a fair price (you can get a glass of wine for $7 and an entree for $13-$15)... it's a bonus that it is close to home! So, even though, for some reason, I keep forgetting that I actually REALLY LIKE the food here, I'm a BIG fan of Nick's. I especially recommend the arrabiata, the gnocchi, and the stracciatella.

Had lunch at SOMA today --- the firey beef salad. It was yummy! The beef was lean; there was lots of lettuce and the dressing had NO oil but a definite kick! Couldn't pass up a side of the baked french fries -- with a soft drink, my total bill was around $12.   Some people may not like that the salad was made with regular iceberg lettuce, but it doesn't bother me.   Today wasn't my first visit... I've had sandwiches in the past. I really like this place and would recommend it for a light, healthy meal!

Very sad news... The friend I was meeting for lunch at Soma the other day, arrived first to discover the doors closed and tables stacked upon one another. We picked another place but I could not help but wonder if they were just closed that day or if it was another casualty of the economy or whatever... after some surfing, I found this report that Soma has in fact "left the Valley" :(  http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2008/11/so_long_soma_cafe.php

Ridiculous that you have to check in on a computer and wait for an employee to help you purchase a phone accessory.   Completely inefficient.   To top it off, evidently since they no longer make the original Droid, they do not carry cases for them.   Seriously? Do you think you are going to get me to upgrade my phone because you don't make a case for it anymore?   So, instead, I go to a Wireless Toys to make my purchase. Guess what? THEY carry the items your customers need that YOU are not willing to stock and ensure the customer continues to think of your store first when they're looking for cell phone stuff...

I've been coming to J'Adore for my past couple of pedicures. $28 is more than I was spending at a salon closer to my house but I like the ambiance of J'Adore better. And the spa chairs are the best I've experienced.   Here are a couple other highlights: $15 basic manicure (so I can get a mani/pedi for under $50) There are several polishes to chose from The salon doesn't smell like chemicals (they do mostly gel nails) Daciana, the aesthetician, has a nice private room with a very comfortable table Eye brow wax is $10 and she did a great job!

No kidding, best pedicure in town! Starts at $28 includes callous removal. They take their time while you relax. Great foot/calf massage. Watch for coupons in Moon Valley Tattler -- just got a pumpkin sugar scrub and paraffin pedicure for $40. The luxury lasted a little over 1 hour... Worth every penny!

This Subway has a drive thru so, as long as you know what toppings you want, you don't even need to get out of your car!   Easy enough to get in and out of the location too.   Personally, I like to hit them up for breakfast. I get the Western Egg White breakfast sandwich on a multigrain muffin. (It always cracks me up when they ask if I want peppers and onions on it, since that's what makes it a "Western" egg white breakfast sandwich -- kinda like asking if you want lettuce and tomato on a BLT...?)   The coffee beats gas station brew and other fast food chains. Put them together and you've got a really reasonably priced breakfast on the go.

Saturday, while setting up for an Easter brunch, I discovered a bird with a broken wing trying desperately to get out of my backyard.   A call to the humane society rescue hotline (they only do dogs and cats and the like) got me redirected to Liberty Wildlife Rehabilitation Foundation: a voicemail answered by volunteers whose outgoing message promises to call back as soon as possible, typically within 30 minutes.   I left a message and then anxiously called back a few hours later after not getting a response. The second call was quickly returned and I was informed that while they do not typically send out rescue volunteers for smaller birds (only the big guys like owls, etc.), if I could capture and transport the bird to their sanctuary, someone would be there until 7 p.m. to accept him and begin to nurse him back to health -- even on Easter Sunday.  The little guy was speedy! Together, a few of my Easter guests and I were able to corner him and get him in a box for transport to Liberty Wildlife Rehabilitation Foundation.  Indeed, the young girls greeted me and enthusiastically took the little guy, trading me for an intake form which collected my contact information and the closest major intersection to where the bird had been found. No money. Just information.   I left a modest donation in gratitude and was able to return home feeling happy to know the bird would have his own resurrection of sorts!

This store used to be scary. I'm not kidding. I would only shop there in the day time and only if I absolutely couldn't wait to go someplace else.   Not anymore!   Today, this is my regular grocery store. They've really cleaned up the store and it's parking lot, added lighting and have a ton of those self-check out lanes so I pretty much never have to wait in a line! They've also added a gas station. Also... I HEARD they take competitor coupons (including the ones from Fresh & Easy). I have yet to confirm this as I always forget the coupons I clipped at home or the office. *ugh!*  There's a Chase branch inside, which is also convenient.  I want to thank Fry's for investing in this location. It's paid off! I'm happy to be a regular shopper at the grocery store closest to home.

This store is back to being mediocre. I wish they'd put a little more effort into lighting the parking lot, and offering to help customers out to their car. I wish their tollerance for loitering was lower. And, I wish their security guards would at least look more attentive... they seem to be spaced out or socializing. I had to call one's attention to the fact he missed an overhead head page asking him to go out to the gas station area. Neighborhood deserves better than this.  The people who work the deli counter and the cashiers are nice...

All you singletons out there know how tired eating a full package of chicken breasts or pork chops can get! Hobe has reintroduced variety to my at-home menu!  I've been here quite a few times thanks to Groupon and Living Social. I LOAD up with meat and have been consistently happy with my purchases. My go tos are: prime fillet, top sirloin steaks, ground sirloin, butterfly pork chops (boneless). They're always very friendly and I like that they can wrap each item separately. When I get home, whatever I'm not using immediately goes into the freezer and I can take out portions to thaw as needed. (1 if it's just me; 2 or more if I've got company!)

2 stars in Yelp lingo means "Meh. I've experienced better." and I have. I ordered the caprese salad and it was served with foccacia. While a generous portion of bread, the tomato and mozzarella rounds were the size of roma slices. It was dull.   There were some interesting cocktails but my bitters and soda (which is club soda with a shake of aromatic bitters in it - helpful for upset stomachs) came in a smaller glass and I got charged for refills. I've never been charged for refills on bitters and soda before anywhere else. Frankly, that irritated me. Quite a bit.   I could have had a mojito for what my 3 club sodas cost.   And, I don't have a problem with gluten or a compulsion to eat organically so I'm not desperate enough to let those demands compensate.

Had to share the good news about Holly White, the optical manager at this location.   It was my 3rd time talking to someone about a recent prescription, while comparison shopping, and Holly spent the most time with me to explain how to interpret the prescription and find the best product.   She also armed me with the right questions to ask my insurance company to make sure I would be adequately reimbursed (since Costco wasn't in-network - which, by the way, is the only reason for withholding a star!).

I make a mean salad. Really.   That's what I love about Market Bistro the most. For the same price as ice berg lettuce and carrot sticks at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes (less, actually), I can direct someone to build  me a beautiful bounty of romaine, caramelized walnuts, red onion, fennel, parmesan crisps, strawberries, apples, blue cheese and top it with tri-tip and balsamic!   Or, like I had today: parmesan crisps, tomatoes, fennel, mushrooms, blue cheese, red onion and pesto chicken.  All of the ingredients are very fresh and you get to pick any seven. I suggest the half salad ($5.29 + $2.29 for meat), because it's enough to satisfy. Especially, if you want to skip the meat and pair it with a slice of pizza (their pesto is frickin' awesome!!) or a half sandwich (I'm partial to the Cuban, myself).   I love, love, love the poblano corn chowder.  The whole experience feels so healthy, it's my favorite place to go after a hike up North mountain or a nighttime yoga class (they're open until 9 p.m.!)... and, don't have to feel as guilty when I add a glass of wine or a beer.  Minus one star for the following: * The line gets LONG at lunch time (like to the door - and, while you can "cut" to the grill counter and order if you just want a sandwich, most of us are there for our own awesome salad experiments.) * It's loud and difficult to have a conversation (or a lunch meeting) * Depending on what you order, you may need eight arms or four trips to carry it all to the table * I wish a piece of bread came with the salads (only comes with the soup, right now).  But none of these are reason enough to keep me from coming back... In fact, I feel potatoes, black beans and rice as mix-ins in my future...

Their rendition of taboule ($6.49) is mostly parsley and a little light on the wheat and mint. Still, a refreshing starter and definitely enough for two or three people.  I come here for the souvlaki sandwich, a generous portion of cubed, marinated pork bundled in a pita topped with onions, tomatoes and tzaziki. The sandwich ($7.99) is served with fries, which I like to dip in the tzaziki too!  The baklava ($2.99) is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Soaking in a delicious rose water syrup... yummmmmmm!!!

I love Basis and feel so lucky to have it in the neighborhood! They have an awesome prime rib sandwich served with au jus in the cutest little copper pan and the prime rib stuffed poblano ROCKS! (It's on the menu as a starter but I've ordered it for lunch and taken leftovers!)   On my most recent visit, our server, Pete, was friendly, patient and knowledgeable. He made some excellent wine suggestions (Opolo "Mountain Zin" for me and Graffina Centeranio 'G' Malbec for my friend), although, he's probably right... it'd be hard to go wrong; they have a great wine list. More than 40 offerings available by the glass! Most days, I find their pricing a high, but they offer half off all wine on Mondays and Tuesdays!   We shared the Maryland crab cake as a starter. The crab cake was at least 2 inches thick and was ALL crab, baby! Not one of those "would you like some crab with your filler" krabcakes... It was served on top of a bit of sauteed spinach and a tempura fried tomato. ($14). Definitely could be a meal in itself.   For my entree, I enjoyed the vegetable burger (which is not made in house). It was tasty, but not my favorite (see the prime rib sandwich or the poblano mentioned above). The bread sort of overpowered it and I didn't get a lot of flavor. I preferred my friend's fresh fish sandwich (tilapia). Here's a tip: Basis offers sweet potato fries, but they're not on the menu.   For dessert, we shared the guarjillo squash flan with caramel sauce and pumpkin seed brittle. I already knew how good it was and ordered it without even looking at the dessert menu. It was as delicious as I remembered with loads of caramel atop ultra-creamy (not slimy, like flan can be sometimes) pumpkin pie tasting richness.   I have since revisited the dessert menu and want to go back for the fresh plum torte with sweet corn ice cream! And, besides... I forgot they offer Rombauer chardonnay... so many wonderful choices. Truly this place DESERVES 5 stars... BUT... They used to have a regular Sunday champagne brunch that was a great value, and, arguably, the best brunch in town! And, they changed it. Selfishly, granted, that's the ONLY reason I'm knocking off a star. You might say, I know the "potential." :)   That said: it looks like they're offering something similar this Sunday... maybe it will make a comeback! Fingers crossed...

Can't give more than 5 stars or I would! $15 for a 3-course tasting menu on Wednesday and Thursday nights. LOADS of choices for each course. Usually 2 meat, 2 fish and 2 veggie selections. Another $5 for dessert. Rock. ON!  (They still do the brunch on the 2nd Sunday of each month - $25 unless it's a brunching holiday, then the price goes up! But, hey! Who needs a brunching holiday to brunch??!!)

I generally avoid cold roast beef sandwiches because the meat is either way to rare and grosses me out or way too thick, fatty and chewy but the promise of blue cheese drew me in and I'm so glad!   I did a 1/2 sandwich and salad combo ($7.50) and opted for the roast beef and blue cheese which has delicious sweet and sour caramelized red onions and peppery arugula to elevate the flavors from "packing a punch" to "round house kick." I wish I hadn't been so motivated by the blue cheese that I would've noticed there was mayo - something I'll have to remember to ask them to hold next time... makes sense to have it but I just don't dig mayo, with the rare exception. For my salad -- still cheese beckoning -- I enjoyed roasted red pepper, goat cheese, sun dried tomato and pesto on a bed of mixed field greens. There were a variety of cool chip flavors (and, of course, the standards).   Bertha's was on my radar because they always have a plate of Bertha's cookies out where I get my hair done. You also get a 2-bite cookie with your lunch combo. It was a yummy double chocolate of some sort. I just wish I could've picked my flavor!   An important note about the roast beef on this sandwich: it was so moist and tender. It had a lovely rosy pink to it. Memories of my sandwich inspired me to look for roast beef while getting groceries this weekend but the selection did not compare... so it made me wonder: will Bertha sell me a half pound of roast beef to go?

Don Guido's is Sunnyslope's hot dog place.  I'm not especially a hot dog gal, but Don Guido's offers something else to Sunnyslope too: Italian Beef sandwiches!   This was my lunch today: a delicious Italian beef sandwich paired with garlic fries! The beef in my sandwich was not fatty or metallic colored like I've experienced in other places. I really enjoyed it and will definitely have it again (but will probably ask for it a little more wet, next time)!   But, seriously, let me tell you about those fries...!!! Don Guido's garlic fries exceeded my expectations!! The fries were nice and crisp, not greasy. And, while I expected a shake of garlic salt to qualify for "garlic fries," I was delighted to find them topped with REAL minced garlic and parsley. A lot of it too! People were coming into my office from down the hall to get in on the action!   We've polished them off, so you'll have to make a run to Don Guido's and get your own. TOTALLY worth the trip!

The great thing about Stax is when you want a burger, but not a whole big, giant, regret it by the end of the meal burger (which ABSOLUTELY has its place) their 3 oz. servings hit the mark!  Today was my first visit and I enjoyed the buffalo burger as advised on the menu (topped with BBQ sauce, cheese and an onion ring). The petite sandwich was just enough to quench that hankering. The table shared the spinach-artichoke dip (super creamy and loaded with spinach) and some sweet potato fries (called sweet pots and served in a mini-fryer basket) with the "spicy" (not to be confused with the chipotle or jalapeno) aioli.   Every thing is a la carte including the dipping sauces, but the prices are reasonable. Three of us had burgers, shared the fries and artichoke dip and the bill was $30 (before gratuity). We all left satisfied.  The happy hour features some $3 food options to match the $3 beer and sangria. Some of the house cocktails sounded marvelous and are $6 during happy hour. Looking forward to my next visit!

This is a great place to watch a game from the TVs in the booths to great game day specials like happy hour food pricing all day (like an inexpensive pretzel the size of a dinner plate!), $3 domestic pints and $5 Titos or Jameson!  They even open at 9AM during peak game watching season and have a breakfast menu!  There is a pool table and shuffle board to entertain yourself when the game's not on (or if you need to divert your attention).

So, I finally did it. I splurged and got a gym membership and am trying to create the new habit of exercise. So far, this 24-Hour fitness is doing it's part! I've been at various times and never had to wait for a treadmill. My only gripe is that it could stand to be a little cooler in there.  I did the Monday night yoga class with Tara and it was the best yoga class I've been to in a loooong time! She's a very thorough instructor and provides gentle feedback to ensure you're getting the postures right.

Still a fan of this 24-Hour. The temperature has improved, though it does seem like they take a long time to get things fixed (a TV, hole in the ceiling and the currently broken front door, for example...) But, they DO get fixed.  I have been enjoying Marcy's Tuesday night Body Pump class. The only draw back is that there is a Spin class immediately after and when the bikes are getting dragged into position while you're trying to pick up your Body Pump equipment it gets a little rough.

What a cute little place! I never would've found it without a Yelp UYE (tiny little thing next to Handlebar J's) but glad I did. It's so cozy and truly unpretentious in spite of a pretty good wine selection!   A highlight was the turkey and green chile pannini (I sorta built my own... a twist on the ham offering which they graciously obliged.) and the sweet potato chips were a nice compliment.

4.5: The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the location. The view from the patio is pretty much parking lot and the backs of buildings.   But, holy cow! The wine selection is VERY good. The staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions (thanks for the zinfandel tip! YUMMM). The prices are fair too!  And, as much as I love green chile, my new fave is the fig and gorgonzola app. Still a pannini... I didn't know blue cheese could get that creamy when it melted!  Man, I wish this place was closer... I'll still be back!

Thanks to David B. and a serendipitous coupon from lunchclub.com, I finally went to Los Reyes de la Torta. The description of the Huarache con hongos is what really did it... and it was perfectly described!   It's like an extra thick soft corn tortilla topped with beans (navy or cannellini, not pinto) a LOT of queso fresco and... hongos (mushrooms). Don't like mushrooms? Pick a different topping... much like (as Dave B. describes) pizza!  The waitress asked if I wanted red or green salsa and I asked for sides of each so I could try them both, but I only got the red... which was fine, because it added good flavor.   The portion was huge! And, the price was fair (around $7 including a can of diet coke)

I keep coming back!   Latest obsession is the shredded shrimp quesadilla. Apparently, there's some sort of translation problem because "shredded" means "with onions and bell peppers." In addition to onions and bell peppers -- and shrimp, obviously -- the ginormous quesadilla is filled with cheese, guacamole and smokey, bacony beans!   So good!   P.S. When I was there yesterday I noticed a sign that Man Vs. Food was there to eat the torta. Episode airs next week, I think...

This is the real deal! GREAT food! The owner/chef grows her own Thai chilies and other ingredients, like lemongrass. Warning though: it IS fiery! I totally suggest going with the "3-star" heat if you like it spicy. You can always make it hotter, but you can't make it more mild... a lesson learned with the papaya salad that had me licked about 5-bites in!

I am NOT a morning person, but for a cheap dinner with some Yelp pals and a week's worth of produce... a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do!  The website is really difficult to understand but basically, you click on the words Log-In on the masthead of the site to place an order. When you place your order you can get your $15 basket and add "packs" (prices vary) like a tropical pack (things like pineapple mango, lime and coconut), guacamole (things like avocado, cilantro, jalapeno and onion) pack or Italian pack (things like garlic, onions, tomato and eggplant) or breads. Orders need to be in by 10 p.m. on Wednesday night.  There are loads of locations to pick up your basket, I try to pick the closest location that allows me to sleep a little more. (I'm not AWAKE at 7 on most weekdays, let alone AT my destination!) Pick up times are FIRM, so if you are supposed to be there at 7, be there at 7 - as soon as the baskets are gone they're out of there!   You need to bring your own containers to take the items home. While the baskets are rationed into laundry baskets, you don't get to take the basket with you. A couple of reusable grocery bags will do.   Here's an inventory of what we got one week (we added the tropical pack for $7.50):  10 lb bag of russet potatoes 1 cantaloupe 1 head romaine 3 stalks of broccoli small bag of brussel sprouts cherry tomatoes peaches apples pluots (plums) 1 cucumber 12 bananas 4 yellow onions 1 bag of grapes coconut a pygmy pineapple (seriously, it's the smallest pineapple I've ever seen!) 3 mango 4 kiwi 4 limes  There is no way I could eat this much fruit and vegetables on my own (5-a-day be damned!) but  Amy D., AMber W. and I have started a tradition of cooking dinner with items in the basket and sharing a meal while we split our bounty. It's been a great way to end the weekend!

You might say I'm a "regular." I absolutely love Bomberos and can be found there with my laptop on a Saturday morning for breakfast, having a lunch meeting during the week, unwinding at the bar after a long day at work or on the patio enjoying the company of friends late into the evening. (Although, not THIS week, because it appears they are closed from 12/22 - 12/28. Making up for it with a free wine tasting on 12/29 though...)  Truly, there's little to add to what's already been said: Hands down it's the best patio in the Valley - water features in the summer and an awesome fire pit for the chillier months. Live music on the patio most Saturday nights gives people a chance to relax or get up and get their Latin groove on. Inside is urban chic but unpretentious and lets you feel cool for being there no matter how cool you are. Breakfast portions are generous and the coffee is awesome (said the self-proclaimed coffee snob).  By the way, my favorite breakfast option made a short appearance on the menu but can still be ordered: salami and Swiss omelet - egg whites only with home fries... yummy! Lunch offers a half salad - half sandwich option and there's always a "salad of the day." (I can't pick a favorite panini or bruschetta because they're all good but I can say putting manchego on the tuna makes it even better!) Free WiFi and it's VERY quite during the day making it easy to have a meeting or catch up on some work.  I remember sitting on a crate in the building that is Bomberos before it was a wine bar and drinking a bottle of whatever my friend picked up from Orange Market at the corner and dreaming about what it would be one day... Christi and Oscar have done a superb job in their first year and I'm so grateful to have such a great place as my neighborhood hang out!

Still loving Bomberos... ~ They've added some pannini including a cantaloupe, prosciutto and mint which is a refreshing choice with a salad.  ~ $8 now for salad, panini or bruschetta OR a 1/2 pannini and half salad at lunch!  ~ Happy hour from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. gets you 1/2 price wine by the glass or $4 for beer (all imported).

The prettiest cupcakes I've ever seen!   I was wooed at the Yelp in Bloom event where I enjoyed half of a lemon-raspberry cake. And, exclaimed with glee, "you mean I can buy these like donuts!?!" when I understood they had a cupcake shop.   I had driven by Let Them Eat Cake in the past and just assumed it was a bakery for elegant, custom cakes - a place to call when planning a wedding or hosting a shower of some sort. That feeling was reinforced a bit by the lovely presentation at the Yelp in Bloom event. (check out Vanessa M's pic - it's hard to tell from the perspective here but these were hearty handfuls to be eaten straight from the wrapper with a fork!). Barbara Gardner was even wearing her Food Network chef's coat earned at a soon-to-air Food Network Challenge for anniversary cakes!   It just so happens, I was going to visit a friend who had just celebrated a birthday and figured a cupcake would be a nice little gift. Friday, I stopped in the cupcake shop to make my selection. It was tough - there were at least a dozen options!   I went with Better Than Sex for the gift - a chocolate cupcake, filled with cream and dipped in caramel, topped with chocolate ganache and nuts. I didn't get a chance to taste it. I heard it was tasty, though not exactly better than sex.  Of course, it gave me the excuse to get a cupcake for myself. My choice was Oreo ($3.25). I used to love an Oreo Cake offered at a coffee house in Tucson when I was in college. This cupcake didn't quite measure up. Aside from the Oreo on top, it didn't taste like Oreo and the butter cream mountain on top combined with the butter cream fillings was beyond overload. Don't get me wrong. I ate the whole damn thing! Took me two tries, though. :)   Anyway, my only complaint is in both cupcakes I've tried it seemed like there was less cake and more filling. For the time being, I'm attributing that to my selections. I intend to try one of those ganache topped cakes myself. And, maybe even a Plain Jane (vanilla cake with butter cream and sprinkles). Not to mention, the coconut cream is calling to me... after all, I have a punch card. Ten more cupcakes and I'll get one free!!

I've attended this bowl game twice. Both times, I left a little into the fourth quarter. Both times, some insane, game-changing play went down about the time I hit the parking lot.   Point is: you can pretty much count on a good game and it's not an outrageous ticket price.   Tip: take the next day off or make arrangements to go into the office late, so you don't have to worry about a late night out watching football and you can stick around for all the action!

I don't know why I only gave this place 3 stars. I recently did the metate trail and felt like I was at an arboretum or botanical garden. Lots of plants, scenery, cactus and wildflowers starting to emerge. It's a great place for a nice walk!

I like Humble Pie. A lot. I would rank it above Cibo, but below Bianco - because Chris Bianco is magic.   Here's what's great about Humble Pie: I've usually been for lunch on a Sunday, but have also been for dinner and have never had to wait. The pizza is perfect! Lots of gourmet pies to choose from (I've tried the prosciutto, pear and Gorgonzola, the potato and roasted garlic with fontina and Gorgonzola - add prosciutto and, most recently, artichoke hearts, caramelized onions and olives - I think this was my fave so far). To quote the Great Muppet Caper... "I HATE peperoni" but my dining partners don't... at Humble Pie, I can get my fancy schmancy pizza and they can get pepperoni. The fries ROCK!! The veggie salad is so refreshing with just the right amount of herb vinaigrette dressing. They're just crazy enough to offer olive oil gelato and I'm just crazy enough to try it! Mondays are half off bottles of wine.  Here's what's not great about Humble Pie... I live too far for delivery. (But, really that's probably a GOOD thing.)

I need to update my review because I was so specific in the original and some things have changed. I still love Humble Pie but they changed the fries and I don't like them. The pizzas are still delicious -- these days I especially like the one with leeks and pistachios -- and the veggie salad still rules (although there have been times it has been overdressed). Humble pie is definitely in the pizza rotation!   Also, still a great place to drink wine with half off bottles on Mondays or $5/glass until 6 p.m. everyday! Not to mention the prices are still beyond reasonable even when it's not happy hour!

Went back to listen to Shay Veno perform. What a great place to hang out in the neighborhood! (although the music started about 45 minutes later than was advertised, which wouldn't be AS big of a deal if it wasn't a weeknight...)  BTW, the corned beef and cabbage taquitos are really good!!   Definitely worth keeping an eye on this place...  I plan to go again...

I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my "uncouth" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss...   It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine.   Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat!   While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95).   Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states "no substitutions or modifications"... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a "modification"?   At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as "Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body."   It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's "beauty" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of "nothing fancy."   How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then?   The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams "pretentious and grandiose" and tainted our entire experience.   To quote my dinning companion, "You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!"

I ate here during Restaurant Week and it was acceptable. The setting is lovely, without question. The decor is impeccable! But, the food was just OK. If it wasn't Restaurant Week pricing, I think I would've been disappointed. I had the rock shrimp ceviche which was topped with too much mediocre guacamole. The swordfish was simple and cooked very well. Simple is a good thing with fish, in my opinion. It had good flavor. I really enjoyed the tomatoes that accompanied it.  The fingerling potatoes were acceptable (though, they could have used a bit more seasoning). My dessert, Baba au Rhum, was OK. I notice none of these items, except the fingerlings, are on the regular menu but it seems you'd put your best foot forward during Restaurant Week, when you can count on some new customers who have been looking for an excuse to try your restaurant to seize the moment. In this case, they didn't create a new regular.

2.5 stars really. I've been holding off on the review because I stunned myself by paying $6.50 for a macaroon. Really? I did that! Ugh. It was tasty but $6.50!?!   And, that's not even counting my breakfast: $9 for a wedge of quiche and a salad (that I didn't want - I just wanted a piece of quiche).   I don't mind paying for good food (anyone who knows me knows food is pretty much WHAT I spend my money on... ) but I'm having huge buyer's remorse... over my meal! Something's not right with that.

Holy cow! This is NOT a "where's the beef?" burger! And, they are hand-formed, saw the guy molding patties with my own eyes!!  The greasy, heart-attack-in-a-bag $5 special is not for the faint hearted.  The green chile delivered the heat. Couldn't even finish my fries!  I WILL be back, but I'm definitely going to have to ration myself! Good thing it's not on my way home from work!!

Chick-fil-a is comfort fast food for me. I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which, unfortunately, they sometimes skimp on, in my opinion.   I have to tell you, though, I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week, but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole "kids eat free" thing.) I was so mesmerized, as I waited in line to order and then for my food,  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And, their kids' meals have educational toys, often promoting literacy).

I went to Il Posto last night because I wanted to eat there one more time before I wrote my review. I go there for lunch with the work bunch on occasion. They have a popular lunch special with pizza and salad ($7), but I especially like the goat cheese sandwich. It's a flavored pita folded over marinated veggies and loads (I mean LOADS) of goat cheese! It's called a panini, I think, which threw me the first time because a hot pressed sandwich comes to mind when I hear the word but this one is not hot. Let me tell you: that is NO REASON to skip the burst of flavors this provides!  A few weeks ago, I was there to grab a quick drink with a friend. We sat out on the cute patio that is set up to look like a street in Little Italy, U.S.A. These people can pour a drink! I already had a dinner commitment, so I just noshed on the bread and pesto that was provided. The pesto was loaded with parmesan... soo delish! And, the warm bread was better than any I've found in Arizona so far!  Last night, I had a crab cake appetizer as my entrée. I got three for $11. Not much filler, but lots of diced veggies like onion, peppers mixed with the crab. I was full by the time I finished and could not have taken another bite! All together, I had two (generous) vodka sodas and the crab cakes (plus more bread and pesto, of course!) for just under $30.  I hear from a lot of people in the neighborhood how they miss Our Gang (what this place used to be called) and they lament the old meat sauce or some other menu item that got dropped when they changed the name. Last night, I found out the meat sauce is back! And, Matt, the manager has been very accommodating and open to suggestions every time I've had a minute to pester him about what's going on with the Lounge (the '60 era-Sinatra style venue they plan to open next door).  So, now I have my eye on the white pizza and can't wait to go back!

There's something about the vibe at Maizie's that feels so comfortable. It feels retro to me... a flashback to Indiana in the late '70s - early '80s. Maybe it's the giant bowls they serve the salads in. They make me think of Pizza Hut after a softball game circa 1980.   Here are some things I like best about Maizie's:  The wingless buffalo dip is deadly -- I mean that in a good way (and it should be on the late night menu). It's gotta be mostly cream cheese... how can you go wrong?!  The fries are good, but the potato cakes are frickin' awesome! Thick mounds of really yummy mashed potatoes with a hint of horseradish, barely browned on either side.  The inside out burgers are literally filled with the items described (my fave is the Feta burger - stuffed with feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes and served with a thimble full of chipotle humus that packs a slight punch and is great on top of the burger as bizarre as that sounds)

I still stand by the potato cakes (although they are flat and not thick any more) and the feta burger - whole heartedly! And, it is true the chicken on the southwestern chicken salad is well seasoned and has a good kick (appropriately soothed/complimented by the corn, jicama, peppers and mixed greens)... but, my most recent trip was on a Sunday and we sat at the bar to avoid the wait.  Our service was excellent, even though they were really busy. Tina, the bartender, was engaging and offered up some great suggestions. That's how I found out about:   the Drifter pale ale - a very refreshing beer with hints of grapefruit and apricot and LOTS of fizz!   the $3 mimosas during brunch and, while I don't do bloody marys because of the tomato juice (yuck!) I had a taste of Tina's secret recipe spicy mixer and it's pretty dang good!! I could imagine drinking one of those bloody marys...   Plus, I noticed they have a Sunnyslope high school football helmet (along with one from Brophy) displayed above the bar! We all know I'm a fan of Sunnyslope... so, for all of these reasons, I'm adding a star!

Fat free and under 100 calories* (for 4 oz.) Italian ice is a light, refreshing ice cream alternative to help lower the body temps.   We're not talking snow cone or shaved ice - Italian ice is made like ice cream except water is substituted for milk. It has a smooth consistency almost like a cross between a sherbet and a sorbet.   Scala's offers 13 flavors to choose from and, besides the ever popular lemon, cherry and chocolate (yum!), there are some interesting ones like: peanut butter, cheesecake and mint chocolate chip.   Italian ice is scraped rather than scooped and served in paper cups. You can choose virtually as many flavors ans you want to cram into your cup without having to go to a bigger size. And, a small will only set you back $1.80.   *Not all flavors are fat free and calorie values vary by flavor but for the most part, we're talking a fat free, low cal treat!   (They also have egg creams, though I prefer to stick with Italian ice!)

This is seriously good ice cream. And, they are so welcoming -- encouraging you to taste your way through the many flavors on your visit. Plus, I love that they source locally and are conscientious of the environment in their decor and product.  My first visit, I went with a friend and with each sample taste, I would try a little and pass the spoon for my friend to try also. Then, I got a taste of the salted butter caramel ice cream. I took my little taste and new instantly that I would order a scoop!  Quickly, a shameful panic swept over me. In spite of knowing that I was about to order a whole scoop of this delicious treat, I could not bear the thought of parting with the remaining bite.   I looked to my friend.  To the woman behind the counter.  Back to my friend.  Back to the woman behind the counter... "Um, can she have her own taste of this one?"   Truly, that basically sums up Sweet Republic's ice cream. Its sophisticated flavors like Cheese Course Duo (a pairing of Roquefort blue cheese and local Medjool dates) or Basil Lime sorbet, or the oft referenced Chocolate Rosemary, peak your grown up interest and get you through the door -- the great taste pushes that grown up aside and brings out the five year old inside of you!    They even let you chose what type of spoon you want... a standard plastic spoon, an old fashioned wooden "ice cream stick" or a tiny little neon colored spoon!!!

My new favorite happy hour spot! 1/2 priced wine (with excellent options to choose from) and select appetizers from 3-6 p.m. The cheese plate could well be one of the best in the Valley. Four chef selections with crostini and only about $8 at happy hour. The mac and cheese is heavenly, creamy, goodness (and, at only $7, a complete steal!).   Service was outstanding.   I love sitting at the kitchen bar and watching the attention to detail and rhythm and beauty of the preparations.   On my most recent visit, chef de cuisine John Green was in the kitchen. He has a charming personality and seems to enjoy engaging with his public.   He had overheard us oohing and ahhing over the gruyere mashed potatoes and generously sneaked us each a spoonful to sample. They were delicious - you could taste booth the butter AND the cheese. He patiently and playfully answered our questions and, on occasion, even challenged us to guess. It was so fun! I can't imagine wanting to sit away from this kitchen!  On my list to try: the parmesan encrusted goat cheese and bacon salad, the burgers, lobster bisque and the beautiful steaks!!   Quick! Someone, save me a seat!!

I still love this place! That parmesan encrusted goat cheese and bacon salad is as good as it looks and the burgers are great - though the bun is bigger than the burger...   Still need to try one of those steaks!

Still my favorite happy hour spot. Half priced wines -- a HUGE selection of quality wines from which to choose -- and gourmet quality food.   While not on the happy hour menu specifically, the mac n cheese remains a deal. It's cheesy but not gooey. The spiral noodles are perfectly cooked. You'll find plenty of pieces of thinly sliced ham.   The flat breads and burgers are standbys. And, these are among the only sweet potato fries I will eat -- generally, I hate sweet potatoes but the seasoning and texture of these fries is doable. ;)  Save me a seat at the bar!

It's been more than a week; and, this afternoon I was driving down the street thinking how much I was looking forward to the burger I know I'm going to have for dinner tonight when I remembered -- it came back to me like a flash of light -- the MOST delicious burger I had recently.   I mean my mouth had the memory, really. The texture was perfect. It was thick but moist -not dense. Juicy, and despite a giant bun, the bread was soft and not overpowering.   WHERE did I have that fantastic burger?   First frustration: I know it's not the burger I'm having tonight!   WHERE was I when I had that burger? I called Dottsy Z. because I vaguely remembered her being present for the experience... with her help, I remembered it was the burger I split with Don S. (a.k.a. Donjay) at District!   MAN! THAT was a good burger!  Now, I'm a little less looking forward to the burger I'm having tonight. Although a value, it will not be as good.  I'm grateful for the memory and can assure you the next time someone asks, "where can I get a great burger downtown?" I'll remember!   I recommend adding green chile... :)  Quite possibly my favorite "downtown" downtown happy hour: the pretzel fondue is a steal, as are the well drinks!

See what happens when you wait too long to write your review!? Phoenix Magazine beats you to the punch and lists one of your favorite finds as one of the Valley's best dishes!   Oh well, I guess I should just feel "validated."  Here's my take on this place: For $12.50 you get a platter full of diced shrimp ceviche bordered by at least a dozen grilled regular sized shrimp and no less that a whole avocado's worth of wedges. It's served with crisp, flat, tostada chips and is plenty to share! A real value!!  If I'm dining alone, I generally get a couple of pupusas. Pupusas are like thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat - your pick! They even offer a version stuffed with the loroco flower, which I understand is similar to a squash blossom. Myself? I'm a bean and cheese girl most of the time. And, I prefer them straight up: skip the tomato sauce and slaw topping.   The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant, served with a couple of handmade tortillas.  Salvadoreno recently got a beer and wine license, and, a I can't think of a better beverage to wash down a pupusa than an ice cold beer!  Oh! I guess this can be my "scoop" - Salvadoreno is going to start offering a $7.95 lunch buffet from 11 - 3. Buffet items will vary depending on the day of the week.  I'm feelin' a pupusa eating contest as a lunchtime UYE!

This is where my manicurist resides now. Corinna is very good, reliable and professional. I've been going to her since 2003 and, as long as she'll have me, I'll never leave!

What a WONDERFUL experience!  Quaint, elegant ambiance. Excellent service and hospitality. Quality food. Beyond reasonable price!   $55 for 4 courses, which included a  fillet on my recent visit. The entree portion alone would've come close in price at other venues!   Only $25 for wine pairing, which comes close to 2.5 glasses (not counting the super generous Yelp check in offer of a free glass of house wine!), each of which was perfectly suited to match our course.  I can't wait to go back! Putting this on my "top 5"!   (And, it's going on the Steak Out list: Seriously, if there is a steak on the menu, I highly recommend at least someone at the table get it!)

Grocery shopping is one of my favorite things to do. Seriously. I love discovering new products; even the potential of it! With a list, I'm compelled to go up and down every aisle. This is why I love Trader Joe's so much. First off, the stores are generally smaller than a traditional grocery store, so that whole "up and down every aisle" thing doesn't take as much tread off the ole tires. The price is ALWAYS right, at Trader Joe's. It's a great value, especially when you're shopping for one or two people. The quality of their products, most of which have the Trader Joe's label is superb! There have only been a few items that left me disappointed. (Not the best crab cakes, for example) Staples in my kitchen include the dry roasted and salted almonds, the dried mango, the mushroom turnovers, mini chicken tacos, tom yam soup (frozen), yaki onigiri (I can them "rice triangles"), lemongrass chicken stix (spring rolls), individually wrapped chicken (refrigerator section) and heat & eat falafel. I can eat -- and eat well -- for weeks on under $75! Also, the cioppino is surprisingly good, though it needs to be served over rice or pasta and I love the scent of the Orange Blossom Honey hand soap.  So, technically though, I'm rounding up. There are 2 things that could make me love Trader Joe's more: if they carried coca cola products, and even more so, if there was a location in the 85020 zip code!

Some more favorites to share:  While THEIR crab cakes may not do it for me, I've invented my own using supplies from Trader Joe's: in the refrigerator section they sell a 1 lb. can of all claw crab meat for about $8! I mix this with 1/2 c. panko break crumbs, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons Trader Joe's Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce and a couple shakes of louisiana hot sauce. It makes about 5 fairly large crab cakes which I pan fry in olive oil for about 4 minutes per side. Now, THAT's a crab cake!   Another favorite concoction, thanks to Trader Joe's is their light champagne vinaigrette, black mission figs, crumbled goat cheese tossed with sliced red onion, arugula and a cut up apple -- it's an AWESOME salad!  Dessert? Trader Joe's dark chocolate bar caramel with black sea salt -- F'n A!! There are NO words!

So, it can ONLY be a good sign when you walk into a place and see a giant wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano, right? I mean, I'm pretty certain this Italian girl could sustain herself on one of those perfectly-aged, salty wheels for, like, at least 6 months! So, I was DELIGHTED when that was the first thing to catch my eye upon entering Hanny's this past weekend.  Then, to be able to enjoy a Pimm's Cup No. 1 (Corbin's Bar & Grill is the only other place I've found it as prominently displayed in the Valley). Pimm's Cup No. 1 is an English gin-based, slightly spiced and citrus flavored liqueur. The version offered on the drink list at Hanny's is a gingery, cucumbery, bitters-like concoction.   I spent the summer of 2006 drinking Pimm's lemonade, so was excited to hear Hanny's has fresh squeezed lemonade.  But, I found their lemonade to be too sour and will probably stick with the standard Pimm's Cup next time I'm there.  As for the ambiance, I liked it. It felt crisp and contemporary to me. Also, unfinished... which it is. I'm looking forward to watching this place develop!

Michele Pantera is an amazing seamstress! I have literally had her rebuild clothes for me. She's very accommodating and quick. She works out of her home (Deer Valley & Cave Creek Roads) and takes appointments between 10-5 Monday - Friday (Thursdays she'll go until 9 PM.) and she does one Saturday a month. BUT, if those times don't work for you, it's still worth a call because she'll do what she can to (in the words of Tim Gunn...) "make it work," if at all possible!   I've used her for alterations, but I've seen custom designs, bridal and theater pieces she's been working on.   Her prices are very reasonable and she offers a "stamp" for every $10 you spend and when you've racked up 10 stamps you get $20 of free services!

A late night cocktail was the occasion for my first visit to Tuck Shop, where I sat on a couch with friends, surrounded by water games popular in the late '70s early '80s (and other novelties) and enjoyed a Pimm's and housemade ginger ale. It was a classic, comfortable environment and I couldn't wait to come back! In spite of our group's VERY late arrival, the staff was so gracious and accommodating. (Plus, I loved, loved, loved my drink!!)   When I returned for dinner, I was not disappointed! We started with panko walnut-crusted fontina which was offered with two dipping options: a roasted red pepper one,  which I expected to prefer, and pear and onion, which, surprised me and made the best partner! A lovely upscale twist on the traditional "fried cheese" appetizer.  That's how this whole place is, though. It takes something you're used to and kicks it up a few! Take for example the yukon jacket potatoes - not your typical roasted potatoes; these are cored and threaded with bacon, anchovy and sage. The presentation was very cool. And, the cores that also appear on the plate are delicious topped with lemon zest and olive oil!   Sticking with a "meat and potatoes" theme, we had the spiced skirt steak which was tender and well seasoned -- served on the rare side. It filled a large plate and resulted in left overs even though two of us were sharing! The mushrooms were so good, I would order them as a side on another visit if that were an option!! For me, the most overwhelming flavor in the parmesan lentil mashed potatoes was BUTTER! But, when it comes to mashed potatoes that is NOTHING to complain about: It was creamy heaven!    I couldn't possibly find anything to complain about with Tuck Shop. Generally, I despise sitting at community tables but we didn't think quickly enough to decline (although, we were asked if it was OK) when getting seated. Although, in the future I would prefer my own table, the people we were seated with were so nice and friendly. We wound up sharing our food!  Finally, in case you missed it in the other reviews: Move over Andes! There's a a ball of raw cookie dough - that's right. You heard me: cookie dough! Rolled in chocolate that comes with your bill.   I whole heartedly recommend checking this place out for a nice classy, cozy meal!

I still love this place!   The menu has some seasonal changes. Right now, you won't find the  panko walnut-crusted fontina or the yukon jacket potatoes but you WILL find "crispy shrimp and okra" which are fried treats that have both shrimp and okra in each puff! Delicious! And, oyster po'boy popovers (4 per order) which made some in our party think of Big Macs - only with oysters.   Fortunately, the pine spiced skirt steak is still available -- with those "to-die-for" mashed potatoes. BUT, it's a tough decision now with the juicy pork t-bone, perfectly crisp green beans and tasty squash gnocchi.  Bottom line is: this place rules! You can't make a bad order. And, it's all about sharing any way. Isn't that what our world needs more of? Places that promote sharing!!

The list of Tuck Shop awesomeness keeps growing. Three words: "ginger ale" and "dessert."   Each are worth every calorie!   I had always skipped dessert here because the novel cookie dough bite was enough to satisfy; but, then, I had a bite of someone's cake here and it was fantastic!   So fantastic, the memory of it compelled me to encourage a dinner companion to pass on dessert at a northeast Scottsdale (we're talking practically Fountain Hills) restaurant and make the trek to Tuck Shop JUST for dessert!   Unfortunately, it was a Monday and they were closed so I had to go with an alternate. Point remains: the dessert inspired the drive. Keep sharing your food and save room for dessert!

I've used Brand X a couple of times now, most recently for a group Halloween costume. They are very patient, however, YOU must provide the creativity.  In my experience, it works best if you come with your own design -- not just as an idea in your head but executed artwork. I like that they keep the artwork on file, in case you want to reprint (or print additional). The quality both of the shirts and the actual printing are very good and they're quick!

I had been reluctant to shop at one of these "cellular superstores" because of the old adage about how when something sounds too good to be true it probably is. I mean if they offer such great pricing, how do they make their money? And, with so many offerings, how knowledgeable can they be?   But, last night after waiting more than 20 minutes in the Alltel store to buy a car charger and leaving empty handed with no less than five people who had been waiting at least 15 minutes longer than me already still waiting to be served I decided to see what this superstore thing is all about. (Skeptical, I armed myself with the Alltel pricing for what I needed.)  I was greeted immediately upon entering the store. The gentleman who welcomed me was helping someone else but indicated someone would be right with me. The other sales person was helping a customer over the phone so I started to browse and was impressed with all the providers they were authorized to represent (not just Alltel, but also Sprint, TMobile, and Cricket) and the variety of phones that you could check out all in one place. It was clean and neat - very well organized: clear sections for air cards, spare batteries, chargers, cases and Bluetooth. Truly a one-stop shop!   Less than 3 minutes and I was being helped. Wound up buying a car charger that was regularly priced $10 less than I would've paid if I had stuck around at Alltel AND because I bought more than one accessory they knocked off another $5! Plus, the charger has a lifetime warranty (that's right: LIFEtime!!!)   I asked about their phones and found that they match internet pricing for all the big names and even beat them for Cricket. Evidently, internet pricing tends to be where you find the best buys. Anthony explained that not only are they authorized by the major providers who allow them to represent the various brands but Wireless Toyz is a franchise and  buys such a great volume of phones nationally that they can be super competitive in their pricing.  Hopefully, I won't be needing another phone for a few years, but when I do I will not be afraid of the cellular superstore! I will make this Wireless Toyz store my FIRST stop!  (Another thing: I found out they buy back used phones and then depending on the condition, etc. they may part them out or just donate them to charity. You don't even have to be buying a phone from them for them to buy your old one! I'm anxious to go back and see what I can get for my old P.O.S. pale pink Nokia... maybe I can get enough for a latte!)

Short and sweet... sort of. It's not a long hike (0.6 miles) but it's steep (500-foot gain) and several loose rock sections make it slippery, increasing the challenge. The trail is really easy to follow with lots of short switchbacks. Once you get to the saddle the trail becomes a little less obvious as you scale the false summit, working your way to the left. Eventually, the summit will be within sight. You're only seconds away on a straight, flat shot.  The views are probably the best from all the nearby options.

My first thought was, "this is gonna be hotel food," but this is definitely one of those books you can't judge by the cover!   Two particular highlights:  1) this steak ranks in the top two, if not the top spot on our search for the Valley's best, for it's simple, beefy flavor, perfect temperature and soft, melty texture.  2) the use of beet in the beet salad is brilliant! They are creatively disguised as ravioli casing; tucked inside: a sweet, salty mixture of locally-sourced goat cheese, candied fruit and nuts.   The missing star is for the venue: The environment is disloyal to the kitchen. Tucked away on the property with no view to warrant its placement, dim lighting with no further romance... Marriott has a gem here that deserves the polish to shine!

The. most. wonderful. brisket! Smoky and tender -- it's my favorite thing on their menu. Normally, I'm more of a pulled pork BBQ kinda girl but this brisket has converted me. The potato salad is rich and packed with dill and the coleslaw is refreshing with big pieces of olive (so beware, if you don't like them). Interesting bottled beer selection at fair prices.   Destination-worthy BBQ!

Did you know the north central Phoenix community of Sunnyslope includes the first subdivision built in the Phoenix area and has existed since before Arizona was a state?  Originally settled by poor tuberculants who spent their last dime traveling to a drier climate, Sunnyslope was filled with tents and cottages with porches. In 1911, retired architect W.R. Norton (who had already been living in the area for four years) planned a subdivision and named it "Sunnyslope" inspired by his daughter's remark, "What a pretty sunny slope!" after seeing the morning sun on North Mountain.    By the 1920s, Sunnyslope had grown into a small yet diverse community of prospectors, homesteaders, writers and musicians, among others. Today, the population tops 51,000 and is still very diverse, representing various gifts, ethnicities and socio-economic groups.  Perhaps the most notable quality about Sunnyslope is the community's strong sense of independence, characteristic of its unique sense of place. Residents tried several times to incorporate, finally relenting in 1959 and allowing the community to be annexed by the City of Phoenix. Still, despite being located in the middle of a large metropolitan area, Sunnyslope maintains a unique, small town atmosphere with an active and engaged resident base.  Besides its cool history, other unique elements of Sunnyslope include: * One of the few places in Phoenix where in-fill development opportunities exist. * Diverse housing stock and elevation - from living room windows you can see downtown. * Lots of outdoor amenities: Murphy's Bridle Path, the canal, North Mountain preserve and more than five city parks. * 9 public art installations. * Easy access to downtown Phoenix. * John C. Lincoln Hospital, the community's largest employer, acts as convener for community meetings and events such as a community policing meeting, the Sunnyslope Fall Festival and the Sunnyslope Art Walk. * Sunnyslope Village Alliance hosts regular meetings with elected officials representing the community. All are open to the public and there is no cost to attend. * Sunnyslope Historical Society is housed in what was once the People's Pharmacy building. This building's claim to fame is that is was the first drive-thru window west of the Mississippi. * Authentic Mexican food representing regions including: Oaxaca, Mexico City and Sonora. * The best patio in Phoenix (Bomberos Café & Wine Bar).  * A free neighborhood circulator where you just wave down a shuttle and it will stop (plus there's a transit station for the city bus). Light rail plans to stretch to 19th Ave. & Dunlap which will be a bonus!  While Sunnyslope did experience a period of decline, a result of older housing stock and poorly maintained rental properties, people who have called this place home have remained vigilant in advocating for their neighborhood and care about their neighbors.  Sunnyslope is experiencing a renaissance and is getting more attention for its best qualities; but, truly, if you ask anyone who lives here they'll probably tell you the very best thing about Sunnyslope is the people!

Just got done with "lunch" at Scramble, Sunnyslope's newest breakfast spot! They've only been open since Monday (this is their fourth day in operation) so I expect some adjustments will happen over time... here are my initial thoughts, after one visit:  They've definitely improved the old 1980s Le Peep interior!! This contemporary new look is perfect for the neighborhood! The set up is kind of like Sauce, where you file past menu boards as you approach the register to order. You'll be given a number to place on your table so food can be delivered to you. There's an island station for drinks, condiments (ketchup and Tabasco) and silverware (although the cups are paper). The chairs are silver and resemble plastic lawn furniture but are made from a lightweight metal (caution: they are VERY noisy when they clank against one another as you drag a chair to move it!). Not necessarily a seat you would want to settle into, but, hey! We're here to eat, right? There are large TVs mounted throughout the dinning area which I have mixed feelings about - I get very distracted by the closed caption because I'm sucker enough to believe FOX or CNN when they alert: "breaking news."  My lunchmate and I tried one of their "signature breakfast pizzas" called Brizzas ($8). A puffy, crust covered with creamy scrambled eggs. Ours was topped with mushrooms and decorated with a few leaves of spinach, fresh sprigs of thyme and melted cheese. While the eggs were perfect, the pizza did not have the flavor punch I had expected.   That said, the eggs were very good and I'm looking forward to trying an omelet ($9) or breakfast burrito ($7) on another visit. Although, I'm not sure I can say it will be my next one because the cinnamon rolls which are baked fresh daily in house or the pancakes (buttermilk, multigrain, caramelized banana, vanilla peach, seasonal berry, chocolate chip or peanut butter chip) may divert my attention. Also, the Santa Fe eggs benedict ingredients of jalapeno corn bread, blackened ham and chipotle hollandaise are tempting...  Scramble is open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. so they do have some lunch offerings (served after 11 a.m.). We also split the simple salad: butter lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion with a lemon vinaigrette. The salad was fine. Tasty fresh ingredients (I spied some more thyme in the salad too) and was chocked full of avocado, but I don't think the portion was enough to satisfy as a meal and that made the price seem a little steep ($7.50).  I'm looking forward to walking to Scramble on a lazy morning and taking advantage of the outdoor seating along 7th Street while I sip coffee, read the paper and chow down on some pancakes.  Hey, Scramble, welcome to the neighborhood! Glad to have ya!!

4.5 stars: The Santa Fe eggs benedict are good, a little sweet, and depending on how much you like to consume for breakfast enough to feed two.   And, I recently enjoyed a three cheese omelette which was delish, especially because of the boursin cheese! The omelette is a great option when you kinda want pancakes too because you get to choose a side and dollar cakes are an option.   BUT, the Southwestern breakfast burrito is my FAVORITE!! Holy cow!! Sooo cheesey and packed with ground chorizo. I think the jalapeno cream cheese must be the "special sauce" that makes this quite possibly the best breakfast burrito I have ever had!! I ate HALF of this bad boy one morning and didn't get hungry again until dinner!

I'm afraid to try the cinnamon roll because I've had the chocolate chip cookies and they are hard enough to resist!   Seriously! You can TASTE the brown sugar! The perfect (ENORMOUS!) old fashioned chocolate chip cookie.

Happy hour at Postino rocks! And, while it's a wine bar and I DO love my wine, I dream about the pub board. I mean, where else can you find corn nuts on a restaurant menu? And the wedges of prickly, little round pickles are so tart and delicious! $5 mini pitcher of Hoegaarden washes it down perfectly.

Yum! Mr K introduced me to Bosnian sausage sandwiches several months ago. The place was not exactly convenient for lunch but I would occasionally crave the delicious spongy bread with the plump beef sausage nubs, sour cream and red pepper spread.  At the same time, I'd drive by Panini Cafe & Bakery and think, "I gotta check that place out!," thinking I'd find the hot pressed sandwiches we've come to know as panini.   Then, the Yelp application for Droid called my attention to this place and I began to read the reviews - growing increasingly excited to find these unique Bosnian treats so close to home!   Today, I made a special trip for lunch.   The woman at the counter was friendly and helpful. I learned about the many breads baked there. Saw a "pita" which reminded me of a stuffed croissant. For under $2 I can pick one up filled with egg, spinach and feta or... nutella!!?? They open at 8, Tuesday through Sunday. No doubt, I will be back for breakfast within the week!  The "small" sausage sandwich (pictured) was $5 and was just as delicious as the one Mr K had shown me with one exception (thus, 4 stars instead of 5): they did not have sour cream and red pepper spread condiments. Now that I know they're there, I can get take out and have those condiments at home (Trader Joe's has a great red pepper and eggplant spread) so it's not the end of the world. The sausage is dense and flavorful but not too spicy.   Other sandwich options include gyro meat (lamb or chicken) or chicken breast. There are a few salads to choose from with meats available as toppings. A variety of breads can be purchased in whole loaves to take home. Limited beverages are available in cans and bottles; prices seem reasonable.  I can't believe I waited so long to go in there but, in many ways, the timing was perfect, as I was prepared to appreciate the unique ethnic offering!

After I spent several unsuccessful hours shoe shopping, I entered this Steinmart as a last resort and I quickly discovered it should have been my first stop!  I had scouted DSW, Famous Footware and E&J and whenever I found I shoe I liked, I was not willing to pay what they (the "discounters") were asking. This Steinmart had many of the same shoes I eyed at DSW and E&J but for as much as $20/pair less!   So, this review is as much a future reminder for me as it is intended to help you, my fellow shoe shoppers.  NOTE TO SELF: Looking for shoes? Go to Steinmart FIRST!!

I hereby nominate the Parlor's basil vodka gimlet as best cocktail in the Valley!  The pizza's good. The pastas are house-made - and well, I might add. Great sauces. I love the salon chairs at the bar - a nod to the building's previous incarnation.  But that drink. I'm tellin' ya: Best. Of. Phoenix.

Sunnyslope's latest addition is an upscale steak and seafood restaurant, complete with white tablecloths and live jazz music some evenings.   The large building that backs up to the canal was most recently home to the Calico Cow. The floral/country decor that had provided the setting for comfort food has been replaced with red walls lined with large black and white photos of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Rat Pack favorites.  Guests can now enjoy delicious house-made New England clam chowder and perfectly seasoned, slow cooked prime rib accompanied by live jazz or in a private dining room with a Western theme. When it cools off, I'm sure the patio will be a popular spot!  They have been open for one week and I've been there 3 times. Here are some of the things I've tried so far:  The clam chowder ($6) was a real highlight: loaded with littleneck clams, Yukon potatoes, fresh dill and double cream. This soup is not thick and corn-starchy, which usually prevents me from even considering it.   The shrimp for the shrimp cocktail ($11) is poached in Riesling and served with a cocktail sauce spiked with cognac.   The steak bruschetta ($12) lines crostini with thinly sliced rare filet mignon, gorgonzola and a balsamic reduction and a pairs them with a side of diced tomato, onion and basil to be applied at your own discretion.  The prime rib ($18, $20 or $22 depending on the cut size) is perfectly seasoned and not too fatty.  The chicken lahvosh ($16) is a generous serving of 2 breasts, pounded and encrusted in lahvosh crackers. Served with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms and tomato in a chardonnay sauce. The night I had this there was not much sauce. I hear that is not the norm. There was so much chicken, though, I took one of the breasts home as leftovers and ate it cold the next day on a salad. It was even better the second day!!  Menu items are a la carte, so if you want potatoes or veggies you'll have to add those at $5 a pop but they are served family style and there is enough for at least 3 people per serving. I've tried the whipped Yukon potato that is creamy and buttery - just like mom makes! But, watch out for the potato au gratin: the table may fight over this scrumptious blend of potato, green onion and bacon loaded with Jack cheese!   At lunchtime, there are a few more salads to choose from and sandwiches, burgers and wraps averaging $7-9. Sandwiches are served with your choice of garlic scented fries, sweet potato fries, regular fries, salt & vinegar chips cottage cheese or coleslaw. I had the roast beef au jus with garlic fries and would have liked to see a little more meat on my sandwich and a little more salt in the au jus.   I hear great things about the blackened mahi-mahi so that's next on my list!  The owners are not new to the industry, having previously owned Jackson's in Flagstaff. A perfect match for Sunnyslope: a close family team that loves community. You'll find them making the rounds in the dining room greeting patrons and striking up conversation. And, while an upscale dining experience, there's no pretension to be found here. I wish these guys the best of luck and welcome them to the neighborhood! It's so great to have yet another choice for dining out in Sunnyslope!

I had grand expectations for Calistro Bistro! I love farm-to-table. I love the fresh, local food movement. Sadly, it just didn't measure up.   A nod to our server, as service was excellent and the "that spicy mango thingy" drink (a Serrano pepper & mango infused tequila margarita) is unique and will please those of you who like cocktails with a bite.   But, that's about as good as it got. "Farm-to-table" inspires visions of entrees with crisp, fresh, complex and discernible flavors. Our food reminded me of standard hotel fare.   We started with the crab cake and while the crab was very good there was way too much filler. To the extent that I would get whole bites of filler, disappointing my palate with a mealy bready effect.   Next, one of each of the street tacos. Both were terribly -- like disgustingly -- greasy. Beware: hold these puppies right over your plate because as you angle them for a bite, a river of taco-seasoning -infused oil will stream out the back. And, the chili-powder flavor didn't do it for me.   Finally, the Arctic Char entree: the vegetables and the fish were each overcooked. Though, there was some potential as the cut of fish seemed quality and the veggie selection showed good choices. Besides being overcooked, there was no flavor. None. Nada. :(   So, all of this disappointment and $95 later (not including tip), I think it's safe to say I won't be making the trek to Calistro Bistro again.

Who doesn't love throwing peanut shells on the floor? Not to mention for "bar food" this place takes it up a notch. Most recently, I enjoyed a green chile cheese burger which was ginormous! Already a fan of the ruben and the cheesesteak. Plenty of drink specials and TVs for watching games. On my last visit, I noticed they offer live music on weekends. Will have to keep an eye on that...

Plenty of TVs and a great burger deal on the weekends, which, coincidentally works REALLY well when you're looking for cheap eats while game watching! Know that you'll be getting 2 patties on the specialty burgers which are the ones on sale.

I love frozen custard! Imagine super rich and creamy soft serve and that's frozen custard. As Shannon C. mentioned, they'll always have vanilla or chocolate and you can build your own sundae for as little as $2.39 (includes 1 scoop and 2 toppings) and they make something similar to a Blizzard (Concrete Mixer) for $2.89 (short size) but I keep an eye on the flavor of the day (http://www.culvers.com/flavors.aspx?storeId=399) for my guide.   I mean, seriously, Double Marshmallow Oreo (Rich chocolate custard loaded with Oreo cookie pieces and marshmallow creme)? Or, Butter Brickle (Specially blended butter pecan custard enhanced with all-time favorite chewy chunks of Heath Bar.)  Who could resist a special trip!?!  Culver's is known for their ButterBurgers, though. It's worth noting that unless you order a Deluxe you have to specify which of the toppings like mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce you want; otherwise, ya just get a buttered bun! They make a big deal about the meat being "fresh, never frozen 100% US raised" and cooked to order and they're pretty tasty, but this is a fast food burger, not what I like to refer to as a "backyard burger." So keep your expectations in check an you will be pleased.  The counter service has been good each time I've visited, but I have to give a shout out to my favorite, Luther, who broke it all down for me and, no doubt, made my first visit to the Metro location go smooth.   It's worth noting they have items besides burgers, like salads and pot roast dinners. Although I haven't ventured there yet, I happen to be a fan of pork tenderloin sandwiches and am looking forward to giving the one at Culver's a try.  But, it's going to have to be on a day that I cannot resist the Flavor of the Day... maybe Friday for Strawberry Cheesecake!

Truth be told, I was holding off on my review of Hula's because I just didn't share everyone's enthusiasm for the place.   Without a doubt, the space is cool. The concept is original for Phoenix.   But, I'm not big on super sweet drinks so their signature cocktails were not on my list of "big deal happy hour bargains" and the food wasn't anything I craved. Until now.   They must be new, because they are not included on the menu posted on the website, but there are some rice bowl additions. I had the steak bowl. I'm telling you: the steak was pink and tender, the sauce was spicy and craveable, it was a generous portion size and, over all, that bowl alone will get me to be the first to say, "Hey! Let's go to Hula's!!"

Heads up, Guy Fieri, while this place shares its very small parking lot with a Shell station, it is no "gas station food"!   I just had lunch with Sam. Literally. When I asked where he got his delicious dolmas (grape leaves stuffed with rice and herbs) and he said his wife makes them, the skepticism was on my face. They were perfectly formed and the flavor was intense. He backed it up by showing me his personal lunch from home and sharing it with me to the detriment of the fries in my combo which I was unable to finish after gorging on meat-filled dolmas, stuffed cabbage and squash (none of which are on the menu). And, for the record, his wife's cabbage rolls are AMAZING and should be added, at least , as a special!   So, while dining with Sam he explained that he hails from Chicago where he owned and operated a similar establishment and has come to the Valley to join his sisters, one of which owns King Gyros (http://www.yelp.com/biz/king-gyros-phoenix#hrid:66ywkbFKsg_1IA03dK_JSg/src:search/query:king%20gyro) which boasts its own 4 star Yelp rating after 16 reviews.   Besides the dolmas ($3.95 for 6) and some of Sam's lunch from home, I enjoyed a falafel pita combo ($5.99). A lot of times falafel, similar to meatballs but made from ground chickpeas, is dry and demands the accompanying tahini sauce and then tastes of nothing but sesame paste (blech!), but this falafel is moist and flavorful. Sam serves it with tzatziki sauce instead of tahini and since I can't stand tahini anyway, this is a bonus for me!   I also tasted my friend's gyros which was ginormous! He ate half, if that, and was bringing the rest home -- the pita was overflowing with moist, well seasoned meat.   I'm not a hot dog girl, as I've mentioned before, but Sam is very proud of his all beef Chicago dog ($1.99) which he cooks on the grill; still, an Italian sausage ($3.25) is more my speed.   Without a doubt, I'll be back to Sam's!  P.S. The fries were hot and delicious and had a yummy seasoning sprinkled on them. :)

I love the special feeling of being greeted by Pavle and the ceremony of him checking to see if there's a space for me. (Of course, I've been able to get a seat each time, so that makes it especially alright)   I love sitting at the bar and watching chef work her magic. She's so focused. If it weren't for her assistance in refilling my water glass, I would question that she knew I was there. Being able to watch the kitchen is one of many highlights at FnB, for me.   The food is hauntingly good. It's been almost a week since my two visits and I still think of the lemon creme brulee and the cool way they "brand" the top to caramelize it. I can taste the chocolate cherry bread pudding in a way that I can recall the feel of the dense, soft, mild, chocolaty goodness and sweet cherry on my palate.   I crave the refreshing goodness and beauty of the shaved fennel salad with lovely rounds of watermelon radish.   The braised leeks were hearty and delicious!   I want to work my way through the entire menu. I have already begun to prioritize my list. My only worry is they will have an alluring special to distract me and, if that were to happen, I would not lose sleep over it!

I'm updating to five well-deserved stars.   The jidori chicken is so good, it even has me eating meat off the bone (I'm a boneless girl... no wings or ribs for me under ordinary circumstances. But, for this chicken I am compelled to make an exception)!!   The pasta is perfectly salted and cooked. Hearty, fresh and delicious.   I'm certain you cannot have a bad meal here.   One of my favorite Valley restaurants!!

For fast food, this place hits it out of the park. First off, the counter space, drink station and salsa bar are always clean. Service is prompt and courteous. As you might guess, (el POLLO loco) their specialty is chicken - "flame grilled," though I've never looked for the flames, personally. They offer all kinds of applications from whole chickens (wings, thighs, legs, etc.) to sandwiches, to tacos, burritos and salads.   Heads up: the street tacos are TINY. The burritos are dense (loaded with beans, rice and cheese). Today, I tried the new jalapeno chicken sandwich. It was good but lots of condiments: jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, southwest sauce, lettuce and pico de gallo that distracted from the chicken. Interesting bread - like a hybrid between cibatta and a Wonder bun.   They boast a citrus-marinade which they also use on their beef. I don't know that I've ever tried their beef though... the chicken is moist and flavorful. Maybe, one day, I'll mix it up a bit!  Another cool thing about this place is: there are numerous options for combo "sides" including beans and rice but als fries, corn on the cob and mac and cheese and more!

Looking for something different to do? Friday Night Fanks! You drive into the darkness of nowhere (the road is now paved) and BAM! you're in the Wild West cookin' your own dog and makin' s'mores over the open flames while being entertained with live music, cornhole and wagon rides under the stars! My only reason for deducting a star is because they're gas fire pits and I really would prefer a wood fire, but I totally get what a challenge that would be to manage!

Granted, the ambiance at this location is completely different than any of the other locations I've been to, I think this is such a pretty space! I was especially impressed that despite all the concrete and block, it wasn't as noisy as some other Valley restaurants that share design elements.   As for the food and any menu recommendations, I like the:  Red Pepper Hummus   Gambas Con Ajo (5 shrimp, loads of garlic and tomato. Hint: the description says there's cilantro. I HATE cilantro and I like this dish.)   Spicy Chicken Wrap (packed with chicken, beans and rice -- big enough to share!)   Broiled Fish Sandwich (My fish was cooked perfectly here. There was way too much bread, though. I wound up eating most of the fish with a fork and leaving most of the bread)   Fruit & Cheese Fantasia (A hit with my family. It's huge!)   Wine List (they have great selections! I can always find something I like.)   Perhaps my least favorite thing on the menu: One Thousand Beans because it has tempted me more than once and then proved to be beyond bland -- flavorless. Blech!

Went for a wine and chocolate tasting as a guest and had a great time!   The father-son team buy the grapes as juice (layman's terms) and make their own (extremely) small batch wines. Literally, you could taste the same wine and have slight variation, monthly!   Who wouldn't be inspired to witness these guys living their passion? It was fun! I wound up buying a couple bottles to support the cause. The wines are young (as you might imagine) but I'm looking forward to seeing how they age... who am I kidding? Not too long, of course! Just a couple weeks...   Cool tip: For under $450 you can make your own (their recipe, your custom label and modifications). You get about 27-28 bottles which would make super cool, unique holiday gifts!

I'd been wanting to go to Talavera ever since I fell in love with a scallop they served at West of Western (pre-Devoured) and, finally, seized the opportunity with Restaurant Week.  Most definitely it's a 5 star setting: the view, the decor, the live music on the patio.  I would give the food a solid 3.5 stars. Based on the restaurant week menu, I enjoyed a scallop (that's what I came for, after all!) which was as good as I remembered, complimented by rich, meaty bits of short rib and diced potato.   My main course was the pork tenderloin: a more than generous portion of pork cooked medium. The description said it would be served with acorn squash, fall greens and queen creek fig balsamic. The balsamic was merely a plate garnish and did nothing for the flavor profile (which I found disappointing, as I was really looking forward to it) and the squash sure tasted more like potato than squash.   I finished with the Madagascar vanilla flambrulee. The shallow dish was delivered and the sugar crystals brought to flame right at my place. Very dramatic. The other desserts were only even more amazing! A cheesecake served between two pieces of brioche to look like a slider paired with "fries" made of funnelcake and a raspberry coulis "ketchup," stealing the show.  Hands down, this place hits desserts out of the park!   The idea of coming here for dessert in a romantic setting is easy to conceptualize! I would give 5 stars for dessert alone.   Unfortunately, service, while cheerful and courteous, was slow. Particularly in the beginning when it took at least 15 minutes for menus and water to be brought to the table -- and that was after a request that someone be notified (aka reminded) that we had been seated.   The restaurant week menu looked like an eye exam - confusing and very difficult to read.  The drink prices were probably the biggest deterrent. $16 glasses of wine or margaritas just made me think of other places I could enjoy a meal as good, if not better, and either bring my own or pay less. Not to mention, phenomenal crafted cocktails prepared by "celebrity" mixologists found closer to home! (Don't even get me started on the $6 iced tea!)  We wound up with a $68 bottle with little or no encouragement from our server, despite the fact that they were supposedly offering a summer 'Wine Down' program with 35 wines that are discounted at 35% off. I didn't notice any mention of that at the time.  If I ever give up drinking, maybe I'll come back. Otherwise, my Talavera experience may have been a one night stand...

3.5 - but I'm rounding up because I obviously liked it since I tried to subscribe to their text message specials distro advertised on the receipt while still at the table! Alas, either the instructions on the receipt are incorrect or the marketing strategy has been discontinued -- my attempt was unsuccessful. Maybe the email version on their website will work. :)   Here are some highlights:  * $5 wine at happy hour which runs until 6 p.m.  * The rosemary roasted cheese with strawberry relish & croutons - relying on the menu description what type of cheese is a mystery. It's brie. Standard brie. But it's roasted in the coal fired oven resulting in a smoky black char on the rind. And, the "croutons" are thinly sliced, crisp bread toasts. I felt like the rosemary flavor really transferred onto the cheese and preferred it without the strawberry relish which was very sweet and citrusy (lots of orange rind).  * I had the crisp pork sandwich, which I'm assuming is not hormone free or organic because the menu only proclaims "hormone free and organic beef & chicken"; still, it was quite tasty. A thick slab of pork marinated and roasted in such a way that it easily pulled apart. BBQ sauce was decent, not spectacular and someone in the kitchen forgot my "house pickle" so I'm not sure if it would ordinarily be served on top or on the side. (When I pointed it out to the waitress, she brought me a plate with several pickle sliced - whatdaya know... tasted just like a homemade pickle!)   Had a side of the scalloped potatoes which were awfully black peppery and not too creamy.   And finished with the donuts and salted butterscotch. The salt part was missing. Perhaps a more obvious use of fleur de sel as a garnish or something would give it that missing magic touch.   Overall, I was full. It was yummy. I would go back.   P.S. - There may have been salt in something, though, because I woke up in the middle of the night PARCHED! I can't say for sure it was a result of that evening's meal because my food didn't taste "salty" but I'll keep an eye on it and see if it happens next time. And, there WILL be a next time...!

Recently enjoyed some burgers at The Grind. While I'm sad to report the crisp pork sandwich is no longer on the menu, the burgers are delicious! I had the peppercorn ($10) which charred onion, matchstick potatoes and arugula. I should have added cheese because it was a little on the "plain" side but the meat was moist and rich with beefy flavor. The sweet and spicy burger ($12-candied jalapenos, fried ratatouille and arugula) ordered by a dinner companion was accidentally delivered to me first. It was easily discernible when I took my first spicy bite. The burger had a nice spicy kick to it and, of the two, is the one I would recommend. The fries are limp and leave something to be desired. The onion rings, tempura battered, cannot get crisp enough for my preference.   Looking for a memorable burger, though? The Grind is it!

My favorite place for a hearty breakfast and memories of home (Though I've lived a lot of places, I claim New Mexico). There is NOTHING like good chile and it's near impossible to find after crossing the NM state line. The adovada and the shrimp enchiladas here meet the challenge!  ...So do the huevos rancheros.   Heck!   You really can't go wrong! (And,  YAY for $5 mimosas!)  And for dinner, my favorite is the pork tenderloin, moist and sweet, basted with a green and red chili jelly and the "famous" GCP (a chile stuffed with cheesy mashed potatoes and baked).  As much as I like the hip Dick's Hideaway location, I'm grateful for a greater shot at a table and the "new" Richardson's location just a smidge up the street.

OMG! I'm hooked on the fried pizza. Don't judge. It's DELICIOUS!   When we were in southern Italy a few summers ago, we enjoyed panzerotti -- blurring cultures for the sake of description: they taste like a fry bread empanada filled with tomato sauce, basil and loads of cheese.   I found recipes once I returned but, truth be told, I suck at frying.   Imagine my delight when I saw the fritta ($12.95) on the menu at Pomo!   Quadruple that delight when a "panzerotti" no less than FOUR TIMES the size of what I had in Puglia was delivered to my table!   With each bite, the rich flavor of the fried crust melts into the sweetest tomato sauce in the Valley, complimented by a burst of basil and stretchy, milky cheese!

I blame Shannon C. for my latest frozen yogurt binge. Although, I suppose she shares responsibility with Yogurtology ($0.40/ounce) because I had been to Mojo and I could take it or leave it. Golden Spoon was too far away. But, Yogurtology at Towne and Country is a reasonable distance. I prefer their flavors and topping options include nutella and pretzel M & Ms! Yummmm...  Self-serve stations and the topping bar are very clean; as are the tables and floors.  One bummer is that outside seating is limited to a backless bench or freeloading seats at the near by Souper Salad.  Anyway, with the stamp card, I'm assured $3-worth of free yogurt goodness after my 8th visit. Who can resist?

My apologies for taking so long to update my review! 3.5 stars - pshaw!  Probably my favorite neighborhood stop for a cocktail! GREAT drinks -- just tell Chris, the bartender/host, what type of drink you like and he'll hook you up with some sort of fantastic concoction!   The service is outstanding. Always striving to ensure we're having a great time and willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs. Even "opening" the kitchen after it had closed for us to get some late night eats!  And there's happy hour, now!!

Wow! They were HOPPIN' and I needed in-and-out with a spa pedicure and gel manicure. How many times have you been someplace and they said "no problem" only to have you trapped with your feet in the spa for 20 minutes before they even got to you!?   Not here!! They said they could get it done in an hour and they did! And they did a fabulous job!!

New to working in Goodyear, I'm still experimenting with lunch spots. This place had come recommended and Yelp supported it, so I decided to check it out. I'm generally skeptical about buffets and, ordinarily, would try to go earlier to ensure the best odds of fresh food. I wound up hitting India Garden closer to 1PM and everything on the buffet looked fresh and delicious. I sampled it all and there was not a single item I didn't like. The buffet ($9.99) with my drink and a tip, totaled $16.15. While a little on the steep side for what I'd like to pay for lunch, I can say I definitely feel like I got value for my money and I look forward to future visits.

I was fixated on the Rocket "Burger" of Rocket Burger & Subs... so much so that for my first visit, I though I'd be doing an injustice if I didn't get a burger.  Truth is: what's special about Rocket Burger is 1) the bread and  2) the rocket sauce.  The burger itself... eh, just fine.   And, yes, there's forty million sodas to choose from but if you're looking for "diet," you'll be forced to choose pepsi.  Still: four stars because the bread is awesome! I can not wait to go back and get a sandwich! Chewy, but you're not going to break your jaw or cut the roof of your mouth on it.   And, the rocket sauce puts other "secret sauces" to shame!  Bottom line: don't forget the "subs" at Rocket Burger!

Pork on a Fork is exclusively available at farmers' markets but these Nebraska transplants who were raised on hog farms know their pork! In fact, the pork comes from the family farm back in Nebraska.  Raised humanely, antibiotic and hormone-free, it's more expensive than what you might find in the regular grocery store but, I have to say, I think it's totally worth it!  So far I've enjoyed the award-winning  BBQ pulled pork which was easy to prepare and delicious! Simply drop in a crock-pot and warm. Loosen with a fork, add the BBQ sauce of your choice or eat it straight - $12 worth makes about 5 sandwiches!  Tonight: the Husker boneless pork chops! I can't wait!!

Loved the boneless pork chop too! They are small, but appropriate serving size (a little bit bigger than a deck of cards when cooked). I just lathered with Trader Joe's garlic mustard aoli and grilled for a few minutes. It was delicious tender and juicy!

The drinks aren't cheap and they have yummy draft beers to chose from, for a "dive bar" ($4.50 Four Peaks draft). Add to that: the music was awesome and there wasn't a cover. Worth every penny, if you ask me!!

Fair warning: The potato cream cheese soup is deadly! Just a whiff of it, and I can already taste the smooth, rich, tangy goodness.   The proof: Saturday, someone's kid was slurping away on this soup while I was getting a manicure and, Sunday, I was compelled to find a Wildflower for family brunch. Thank goodness for this new location as it is convenient from church.   (Tip: On our first visit, we saw The Big Unit himself chowing down with his girls!)   We can save Wildflower for the occasional Sunday brunch, but if there were one closer to home, I'm sure I'd be eating there a lot more regularly!

My sister and I gave a Whisked Away cooking class as a gift to our mom, step-mom and 4 stepsisters for Christmas. On December 26, Maggie opened her home (and business) to us and taught us to cook with pumpkin! There were chairs set up in classroom style on the living room side of the kitchen pass-through with vintage fabric aprons draped over the back. We brought a couple of bottles of wine to enjoy and poured ourselves a glass as we took our seats. Maggie introduced herself, and her mother who was visiting for the holidays, and got to work reviewing the recipes and offering up tips for cutting onions, getting the smell of garlic off your hands and answering questions along the way.   When it was our turn, we donned our aprons and entered the kitchen. While it did strike me as unusual to have a cooking class in someone's home, I must say, the familiarity of a homey kitchen contributed to a more relaxed and paced learning and cooking experience (I've taken classes in kitchen shops, etc. before and it had a more scattered and sterile feel). That said, the fact that I was surrounded by family -- some of the most wonderful women I know -- probably also added to that affect.   With our menu complete: Black Bean and Pumpkin Soup, Green Beans with Pepitas, Pan-Seared Scallops with Pumpkin Risotto and Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce, we reclaimed and refilled our wine glasses (they weren't allowed in the kitchen) and took a seat at the family's dinning room table. We enjoyed the fruits of our labor and each other's company while Maggie and her mom did the dishes.   Let me tell you: It was a GREAT gift idea! Everyone loved it and there's talk of making it an annual event.

Worth the drive to Tempe! NOT fancy but totally comfortable thanks to the wonderful, gracious family owners/operators.  Do NOT miss the dill mashed potatoes! Also, I LOVED the tomato sauce that came with the cabbage rolls. Was dipping everything I possibly could in it!!   I ordered both of the beet options but, if forced to choose, liked the beet salad best... wound up "cleaning" the dish by wiping it down with the remaining pickled beets!   I liked the cabbage rolls but I LOVED the hash one of my dining companions had ordered. This is likely what I will get on my next visit.  The pierogi were boiled but didn't seem to spend any time in a frying pan. I love pierogi but I prefer them to have a little more of a crunch -- the firmness you get from a quick pan fry.  It's a tiny, casual place. Order at the counter, they bring you your food and you pay at the counter when you're done.  A BYO, if you also bring your own glasses they waive the corking fee!  Seriously cannot wait to go back!! :9

My family loves this spot and with good reason. You really do feel at home with the lovely hospitality of the restaurant owners (chef-husband, wife and son can each be accounted for on most evenings, as far as I can tell!). Reasonable prices and flavorful food. Save room for dessert because the cheesecake is phenomenal and the spumoni is perfect!

If my service wasn't so horrible, I would probably give them 3 stars. The ambiance/theme is cute, though there's an opportunity to cheese it up even more and integrate it in more areas. I had a Monte Cristo, which was OK and a bite of my breakfast companion's pancakes, which were good. It took forever to get acknowledged once seated and our bill literally never came, we wound up walking up front and asking to close out.

Woo hoo! I'm a fan of Rico's. For starters: they've got a great happy hour and it runs until 7 so you can realistically hit them up after work without getting a speeding ticket on your way there. Happy hour includes a couple $2 drafts (and other drink specials), as well as, some half price "appetizers" which include a jalapeno, bacon, cheese burger. Hello!   But it's also a great lunch option. It's spacious and you can have a private conversation with your lunch date without being squished up against other diners. Lighter dishes are available BUT remember this spot for when you're craving comfort food and get the kick-A meatloaf sandwich. It's open faced, piled high with onion strings and doused with their kitchen's secret spicy ketchup. WARNING: it's totally cravable!

Do you ever feel all crunchy and wish someone would pick you up by the ankles and shake you out like a sheet? That's how I had been feeling before my massage appointment this weekend.   Suzanne is a great massage therapist because I felt great by the time I walked out of there and I'm still feeling great 2 days later!   The location is tucked away in the office complex just east of Max's gas station on the southeast corner of 12th St. & Missouri.   I had a 60-minute aromatherapy massage ($80). I got to pick the scent I wanted her to use and she blended it with the coconut oil to make a custom massage oil just for me! She also put some in a diffuser and near the head rest. The scent was never overpowering. It was just right!   The massage pressure was perfectly firm. While I felt relief from the tension I had come in with, I didn't feel like I had been beat up to get there.   Also a nice touch, she popped a roller ball in the top of the vile with whatever was left of my "custom oil" and I got to take it home with me for a olfactory reminder of my awesome massage.  Next time I treat myself to a massage, this is where I'll be going!!  (PS I used a Spafinder.com gift certificate to come here. Waaay better than going with one of those chains that seem to be the dominant offering for redeeming those certificates.)

Probably the best salmon I've had in long time. It was cooked perfectly and the blood orange glaze, while a little bit of a sweet shock to my palate initially, really balanced with the accompaniments.   It was good that our server advised me that the couscous would be cold -- I would have expected hot, especially on a winter menu but: (a) this IS Arizona, not the northeast and (b) with its refreshing mint accent, it was the perfect accessory to the salmon.   The last thing I ate on my plate was the shaved veggie salad. It was such a great end to the meal. Really pleasant and crisp with the occasional treat of a yellow beet. I even shared a slice of beet with my friend, explaining: it IS possible to like beets if they are handled well. In this case, they were definitely handled well!   A huge fan of Sam Pilsbury to begin with, I think this meal was made for his One Night Stand Rose. A match made in heaven!!   On another visit I tried the pecan fig pie and really enjoyed it. The cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream was novel for me and really complimented the pie. The crust was also excellent. Last night, we had the creme brulee with shortbread cookies and it was a bit of a disappointment for me. While my dinning companion LOVED it, I found it a tad on the runny side and the shortbread crumbly. Flavors were fine but would probably try a different dessert on another visit.   Beckett's Table is a great addition to the Phoenix food scene!

Swung by to pick up some chocolates to bring as a hostess gift for a dinner I was attending this past Saturday. Turns out it was the day of their grand opening and I was early. Fortunately, there were some chocolates to choose from on the bakery side (this is Karl's Quality Bakery-Karl's daughter and the locations are adjacent).   A dollar a piece, the tiny delights were a little pricey but the quality is unmistakable. They were a huge hit as dessert that night. I personally enjoyed the nougat and a honey bourbon truffle. Though, I had major envy over the apricot one... will have to go back for more!

Still a fan but wanted to add a note: this location is closed. Hopefully before the end of Jan. 2014, they'll be open at Central & Dunlap. In the meantime, you can call for orders or retail partners: (602) 997-7849.

Poefest! This tiny, little, black box theater is host to my favorite Halloween tradition: Poefest. For about an hour you will enjoy dramatic monologues of Poe's writing. Sure, we all read these stories in school, but to hear them delivered in this fashion accentuates the beautiful poetry of his prose -- the natural rhythm he expertly creates by organizing his words -- and brings keen awareness to his mastery of language. Which is especially awesome because it's performed by players of Arizona Curriculum Theater (http://www.curriculumtheater.com/), a non-profit organization bringing classical literature, arts, history, sciences, and mathematics to life in classrooms and libraries across Phoenix, and driven by the mission to use the power of the arts to promote literacy, engage students, and make education more fun and accessible -- something they do very well!

This place has mega-potential. I think their intention is to be a local market. I love that idea. Their location is ideal: 1 mile east of Road Runner Farmers Market. I wish they could tap into the vendors there and stock the shelves with local goods.   The staff was courteous and the environment was clean.   Menu items range from $5.45 for a breakfast sandwich to $10.95 for pot roast or "Thanksgiving Anytime." I ordered the turkey feta asparagus pita ($8.95) -- it was ok but someone forgot the asparagus...   Seriously, it's a 5-star concept and location.   It's not executed, though. Meats, for example, are Boar's Head. I happen to like Boar's Head product, but it's not local, which the "Farm Market" billing suggests.   With the Pork Shop, the Meat Shop and Schreiner's -- even Pork on a Fork, which is at the Road Runner Saturday market -- to choose from, Bon Terra "Farm Market's" offerings are no different from your standard grocery store.

I'm not ordinarily a pancake person. Actually, I guess I'm not an ORDINARY pancake person. They gotta be special to get my attention (a la Orange Table's jalapeno pecan pancakes).   It's true what they say about the red velvet pancakes here! DELICIOUS! Not too sweet, even though they're chocolate. (Quick tip: order a kid's portion)   The breakfast sandwich could easily serve 2, if not 4!   Enjoying a cheese plate at happy hour is a great way to spend an afternoon.   Service is spotty. Food and ambiance are not.

The perfect sesame crusted tuna on my salad and a French Manhattan (a Manhattan with some Chambord mixed in) that will keep me coming back for more! Fair prices as it is but if you want to save some dough, keep an eye out for 20% off coupons in North Central News and specials on the 13th of each month!

I have LOVED every bite I've eaten here.   The Bahn Mi ($13) sandwich, is filled with grilled halibut that is tender and light on your palate. You can pick up on the sweet flavor of the honey-soy glaze, although the bread is a little overwhelming (I suggest skipping it or going "open faced").   My new favorite, though, is the brown bag chicken sandwich ($10). This time, I skipped the bread.  The cold, pulled chicken was moist and robustly flavored. The textures between the tender chicken, the crunch of hazelnuts and the chewy tomato kept it interesting. I went with the fresh vegetable which was broccolini and it was cooked perfectly -- still crunchy!  $5 drinks at Happy Hour include the aptly named "No. 1": Tito's Handmade Vodka, Watermelon Agua Fresca, Vanilla-Mint Syrup and Orange Bitters. You can taste every single flavor note in the description. It's a great concoction!  I'm definitely a big fan of Windsor! Looking forward to future visits...

Reading the sad news about Aiello's closing their Central Ave. location reminded me to share the good news about this place. So... Aiello fans, take heed: You have an alternative and it is GOOD!!  I had the. best. stuffed artichoke I've had in a looooong time here (see photo) and, for that, I am a devoted fan! The artichoke was giant and must've weighed at least 2 pounds stuffed! I also enjoyed the eggplant rollatini - the eggplant was soft and sweet and LOADED with ricotta filling. The sauce had the perfect acidity. Seriously, for as big of a fan as I am of the food and as convenient as it is -- it's dangerously close to home!   The adjacent pizza place has a white pizza that's on my list! Looks PERFECT but can't fully vouch for it... yet! ;)

They should have wet wipes instead of napkins, and I mean that as a compliment.  Despite some incredibly enticing flavor combos in specialty selections, I had an "ordinary" cheese burger with a slice of green chile. I say "ordinary" with quotation marks because, in addition to the standard lettuce, tomato and special sauce, it came topped with cucumber and pickled onion (which were awesome!).    These burgers are THIN -- you get 2 2oz patties that are still pink inside. That's a quarter of a pound when you're done with it FYI.   We happened to go on the night their Diners, Drive Ins and Dives episode was to air; so, of course, I looked forward to tuning in and comparing notes! ;)  You know what they totally missed!? Besides these kick ass burgers they have this freakishly awesome, no-doubt-addictive seasoning on the seasoned fries. YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM! First, I thought my boyfriend's "brûlée" bun got on our fries and then I felt the heat followed by a mild tang and I realized: that's the seasoning!! OMG!   If the burgers don't bring you back (and I suspect they will) then these fries DEFINITELY will!

A new favorite! Excellent service, clean, great prices and delicious food!  I had the fresh spring rolls and white meat chicken pho. The chicken was in manageable pieces (almost "pulled") and the noodle-to-broth ratio was perfect.   I will definitely be back!  (minimum $10 for debit/credit cards)

Had the white pizza and it was delish! Pretty sure there's some secret, addictive ingredient they mix into or brush onto the crust! It's got that just right chewy texture and a slightly salty hint of garlic and will have any garlic lover coming back for more!

Was really hoping to find an alternative to my favorite chicken place as I suffer intense guilt every time I go there due to the fact that our "family values" are not aligned. Unfortunately, Raising Cane was not the answer.  There is not a single "healthy" way to order -- seriously, you can't put something GREEN on the menu? Say, a few strips on a bed of lettuce, as an option?   It's chicken strips, fries, bread and slaw (optional). Period. The only question is a matter of specific quantities. The chicken was good, but not "as" good and there is ONE type of sauce for dipping, and I do not care for it.    So, I tried but it looks like I'll still be battling my conscience next time I'm craving a chicken sandwich.

With the right company, this place is awesome!   Particularly, because the few times I've been it hasn't been crowded, it's like having the world's best bartender make craft cocktails to suit your personal palate as you sit by a fire pit and enjoy live music!   Shell, mixed a delicious Manhattan with a Croatian cherry liquor for me -- a super cool giant ice ball to keep it chilled and, after finding out about my desire to keep the calories down, treated me to an awesome tequila drink with a natural juice fresh fruit.   The pork sliders were good... but, she's right, those short rib tacos are awesome!!  Can't wait to go back!!

So far, still happy! Having an issue with the dispenser cup not opening and called (602-494-0100 - the number on the Yelp listing is incorrect) for a service appointment. Kurt was able to find my purchase record and scheduled the service call for me -- even though it is through GE and not their own service department (since it's still in the first year). I gave him my availability and he called back in less than an hour to confirm my appointment has been scheduled. Grateful for the help in getting that taken care of and looking forward to getting my dishwasher back in tip top shape!

Here are a few of my favorite Timo things: ~ The brunch flat bread ($10): bacon, eggs, burrata - the crust has the perfect, ever-so-slight salty crunch that is perfectly complimented by the toppings. I would eat this for breakfast, lunch OR dinner! ~ The mimosa flight: a steal at $9 with samples of orange, grapefruit and cranberry & St. Germain. Shockingly (to me anyway), my favorite is the grapefruit! ~ La fin du monde golden (beer -9% alc.) $6 here, now also found in my fridge at home! Thanks for the introduction!! ~ The day drinker ($9) a magical grapefruit flavored adult beverage and the Irish Sour ($): trust, don't be afraid of the egg white. ($6 at Happy Hour!) ~ That they're always cooking up different things in the wood fired oven - from bacon and eggs to fish and lasagna!   These are just a few... there's a lot to love about Timo!

We popped in for a draught before dinner at Binkely's and sat at the bar. Service was courteous and helpful. There were several beers to choose from (familiar and new to me) and the bartender was helpful with descriptions and samples. Plenty of TVs and a stage for live music.

Still a fan because I love the beer selection, and the venue. But, I want to update because the gnocchi has gotten a little chef-boy-ardee-ish. Not inedible but not as impressive as it once was...  so, I guess, I retract my love for the gnocchi but there's still a lot to love about this place!

There are very few places who can get me to eat chicken that is not boneless/skinless and this is one of them! Not only can they get me to eat it, the jerk chicken here can get me to drive across town on my lunch hour just to indulge. Generous portions of juicy, tender, flavorful chicken piled in one corner of a styrofoam take out tray partnered with loads of rice (flavors vary, for example: rice and beans or pumpkin rice) and your choice of plantains or (my choice) steamed cabbage for about $10 with a drink. The cabbage is still crisp and firm and a nice, mild crunch to go with the rest of the meal. The staff is incredibly friendly. Seating is very limited (stools facing a narrow counter that runs the perimeter of the small restaurant's space) -- but, in a way that makes it convenient to eat alone and be left to stuff your face!   BYO wet wipes though, fair warning!

They do a great job here! It's clean and professional. Walk-ins are hit-or-miss, in the sense that they may not be able to accommodate you on the fly, but it's well-worth the extra effort to plan ahead and make an appointment. (or, at least call when you have the thought: "Hey! I want a pedicure.") In addition to a great manicure and/or pedicure, you'll likely be treated to a complimentary shoulder rub while waiting for your polish to dry: a GREAT bonus!

This place is salt in the wound from one of my favorite local restaurants closing last year. It's basically the fast food version of the same thing.   The concept is a good one: salads, soups, sandwiches. I welcome fresh, healthy options. But, be warned: if you order a large salad, you'll get the exact same quantity of mix-ins than you would in a small salad -- just extra lettuce. Now, let's think about that: it just dilutes the impact those mix-ins have. I find that a bummer.  If that changed, I would probably bump up my review because I do love the concept and I think the Italian soda mixer station is a rad idea! And, I love that their version of the dinner mint is a chocolate covered strawberry.

Experience is the key word for me, when describing R+D.   It's not often you wait in a dark alley to go someplace swanky. Once called, up you get a briefing and an Inquisition: "been here before? familiar with the rules? any food allergies?"  You get directed to your spot. Intimate as you want it to be... make eye contact and someone may ask you about your drink -- or tell you about theirs. Don't make eye contact and you'll be left alone.  You must order from the menu. No tweaking (i.e. club soda instead of tonic is NOT an option).  Each cocktail is hand crafted and takes 3-10 minutes just to MAKE. Some are performances in them self! Dramatic flaming tequila falls; bubbling "gin" being distilled before your very eyes, complete with a lesson on the history of gin.   Prices range from $11 - $18/drink.  A very unique special occasion experience!

I'm pretty sure I'm a fan because I had a discounted VIP admission. Not sure I'd enjoy it as much if I had to pay full price. While there was certainly a variety of trucks there, you really had to be strategic to get the best value for your tokens. I learned I'm not a fan of the latest fad food, ramen. Of the four items I sampled, I give the highest marks to BuzznBees (www.buzznbeezgoodfood.com). Lines were very manageable, however, there was not a lot of shade.  (Oh! And, we looked all over for the Yelp booth and never found you! :( )

Sometimes, I feel cheated by salads at restaurants, because I figure, I could buy a bag of lettuce, dump it on a plate and call it a day for a third of the price! I had a really satisfying strawberry and chicken salad  ($8.99)  here recently and will definitely go back next time I'm in the market for a healthy lunch out: 4 ounces of grilled chicken on a generous heap of salad, topped with blue cheese and fresh strawberries.

OK, I'm not a golfer BUT watching PING clubs being manufactured was SUPER cool! It made me have a huge appreciation for them and even want a set -- even though I have no use for them. So, I'm using this review to help spread the word: Did you know that the world-famous PING golf clubs are made right here in Phoenix?  If you want to see how these excellent golf clubs are made, reserve a tour at the factory, located at 2201 W. Desert Cove Ave.  (just west of Sunnyslope) Tours are available to the public on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays by reservation only.  Tours begin at 9am and last approximately 2 hours. There is no charge, but tours fill quickly so reserve your spot early. The walking tour is wheelchair accessible. Children ages 9 and younger are not permitted. To reserve your spot, please call Millie at 602-687-5385.

If I could sit on an air conditioned couch with a beer and immediately enjoy my nachos, this place would be five stars but, alas, I have to wait to get home... therefore, only four. But four grateful, guilty pleasure, love-filled stars!  $7 for a heaping, i-am-somewhat-ashamed-for-nearly-finishing-them-myslef-sized serving of SUPER nachos. Movie theater style tortilla chips, doused in (what I like to call) "fake" cheese, carne asada, jalapenos, salsa, guacamole and sour cream... consuming them is an entirely unhealthy act of gluttony -- one in which we should all spoil ourselves and indulge on occasion!  They're only open Thursday - Sunday and mostly with late night hours:  Thu: 9:00 pm - 3:00 am  Fri - Sat: 9:00 pm - 4:30 am  Sun: 4:00 pm - 3:00 am

Good pizza. Crust is nice and crisp but slices are still fold-able. Great toppings to choose from and at $2.50/slice beyond reasonable! Lunch special: $2 slices and a drink for $5 and they're quick!   I like the sauce but can't wait to order a white pizza!!   I'm not a huge fan of the alfredo slice -- don't get me wrong: it definitely tastes like alfredo, but that's just not my thing. Maybe if they made it more of a carbonara (i.e. add bacon or ham)!   REALLY glad to have them in the neighborhood!!

A HUGE fan!   But... why is everyone just talking about breakfast!? If you reserve Astor House for breakfast you are missing the BEST part! The cocktails. I'm not even kidding!   All drinks are on special 3-7 every day: Progressive wine prices ($3 @3,$4@4... you get the drift?) Dollar off everything else. I feel like I'm getting away with something at $5/6 prices for genius concoctions! Like, Summer's drink: whiskey, lemon, apple juice, elderflower and prosecco. A bourbon girl, I was afraid the drink was going to be juicy... not at all! More heavy on the prosecco, if anything.  While picking my new hero, Blaise's, brain on elderflower, he mentioned the Texan Elderflower (a vodka cocktail) is especially nice with fresh raspberries. Generous with his recipe sharing and encouraging me to try at home, "I'll let YOU make that one for me..." I responded.  What do you know!? On my next visit, Blaise had raspberries. And, I had the recommended drink. Two of them, actually! They were that refreshing and delicious.  So, yes, Astor house is good for breakfast. The leek flavor in the frittata ($6) is wonderful and despite the small portion (very thin and about the diameter of a small salad plate), a satisfying breakfast.  Ms. Lynne's dip ($4) offers a tangy snack great for garlic lovers. And, the warm focaccia ($6) can go toe to toe with some of the Valley's best grilled cheese sandwiches...   The point being? Astor House is a great spot ANY time of day!

I don't eat hot dogs. I'm not a fan of brats/sausage. Well... I am a huge fan when it comes to Brat Haus brats!!  I LOVE the brats here.    It's converted me. Entirely!!  I crave the duck and date one, with root beer onions. I don't even use any mustard! There's such wonderful sweet, meaty flavor -- and the bread choice is excellent compliment.   Great beer on tap and excellent prices on happy hour.  A Yelp check in got me to try the nutella and soft pretzel which I am now also addicted to.

There's been a million restaurants in this divey space in the past couple years and none have excited me until now. I'm thrilled to have Stacy's in the neighborhood!   Grabbed lunch here earlier this week and it was as good as I remembered but closer!! I had the pulled chicken sandwich and fries. The chicken is tender and smokey. The bun is standard hamburger. Since I really like the BBQ sauce, I need to remember to ask for a side of spicy for dipping my fries. The fries are homemade, thin and skin on -- they're not crunchy (which is good with me, but I realize may disappoint some people). The lunch special (sandwich, side and drink) is $7.10 with tax. CASH ONLY, BTW!!  I understand they're planning to paint the building purple and working on some shaded seating so I can't wait to see this place continue to come together! In the meantime, it's already on the regular lunch rotation!!

I'm a HUGE fan of the Tuesday night TV dinners. $7 gets you a generous portion of a creatively presented, inspired meal. I've experienced the Salisbury steak and the carne asada tacos and found both to be exceptionally enjoyable!   I truly think the whole place is clever! I really like what they're doing and I plan to keep returning.

Had a great meal. The food quality is 5-stars. We ordered 2 drinks, the mussels, the duck bacon salad (fyi: duck bacon is not crispy), croque and mentioned that we would be sharing everything. I was surprised when they brought it all at once. I guess I should have specified that we would be taking our time and savoring courses. Servers were attentive and kept trying to clear our plates which, if we were ready for them to be gone would be good, but we were enjoying dipping the fries in the mornay sauce. On the 4th try, we gave up and let them take it. :)  Prices are beyond reasonable for the quality and from 4-7 every day, get $1 off all food and drink items. Our bill came to $50 plus tip. Worth every penny!

OMG! My sandwich was huge (9" is the smallest you can get and I suspect it was bigger than advertised. I got the firecracker turkey and it sure was fiery! The turkey is real turkey too! Not processed stuff... in fact, I came across 2 slivers of turkey bone while eating my sandwich -- so be careful! Despite the bones, it WAS delicious. I need to find a lunch buddy to split with in the future, so I don't gorge myself on the whole thing in one sitting, like I did today!

Traditional Oaxacan cuisine including: mole, quesillo and chapulines (grasshoppers) -- or, just get a burrito! ;)  I had the emoladas which is basically a rolled enchilada (I had chicken) in mole sauce. The mole sauce was not overtly spicy. It had a nice, rich chocolate flavor. The quality of the chicken (all white meat) was good.   You order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table.

I called ahead, after reading reviews that made me nervous about wait time. I just imagined myself getting in the wrong line, waiting forever -- only to figure out I had a whole new line to wait in. They helped me figure out what I was looking for and advised me there was only one line and the best time to come is first thing when they open. I was there at 8:05AM there was one guy ahead of me. I was in and out with a copy the record I was looking for in under 30 minutes.  Reportedly by 9AM it will be a madhouse as advertised.   Service was friendly and I didn't have to pay for the first copy, since I was the victim. There's a silver-lining for you! ;)

Let me help: Rotisserie Roasted Pork Shoulder on the Brussels Sprout Caesar ($14) and a glass of Liar's Dice zinfandel ($13/$11 on happy hour).   No need to thank me.

Still a fan! Looking for a unique brunch option? This is the place!!   For under $20/person you'll find an array of savory items like cauliflower wild rice, brussel sprout salad, ham, porchetta, fried chicken and waffles, fried green tomatoes, green chile stew... PLUS eggs/omelets cooked to order.    The dessert options/breakfast sweets are a bit of a disappointment but there are $5 mimosas and bloody mary bar, so who needs dessert! ;)  I would still rate this the best buffet brunch in the Valley!

4 stars for the Nacho Mama's! Pulled chicken and pub cheese adorn a half-circles of what appears to be homemade corn tortilla chips. Sides have varied from a green salsa to a smokey red chipotle, but each have been delicious!   I also recommend the smoke salmon. I found the portion to be generous and the flavor to be fantastic!

A generous 6 oz portion of salmon in the $8 bento box. It came with miso soup, was served over sauteed vegetables (zucchini/squash), rice, and 2 gyoza. I've only been here once but I will definitely return. I've got my eye on a $15 sushi roll and some fascinating dessert options like a green tea waffle.

I got a sneak peek at the soft opening last night and, let me tell you: I'm VERY optimistic about this place!   First off: the beer was great! I especially enjoyed the James Brown Ale, followed by the Mit Hefe and I cannot wait for the Sunnyslope Stout to be available.   Our server, Anthony, was friendly and professional. I appreciated his recommendations and attentiveness.  We started with the mussels (the best I've yet had in the Valley of the Sun!), -- plump and soft, well seasoned not overly cooked. I will likely be  making a meal of these  in the future -- and, enjoyed the "bread" which are medium-length pretzel rolls served with a light, fluffy, sweet, house made honey butter, Dijon mustard and a nutty, garlicky pistachio pesto.  I enjoyed the Shepard's pie, made with tender, flavorful lamb topped with delicious mashed potatoes. And had a bite of a dining companion's fish and chips - perfectly battered, moist, flaky fish - something I would order in the future, though I'm holding out for the poutine which was not available yet. I understand they're perfecting their fries to be "made" for this dish!   They've been "practicing" on their Mugg Club members (http://www.northmountainbrewing.com/wordpress/?page_id=22) a subscription email that alerts you to special brews in the forecast, top-secret private engagements, and other "need to know" information. They open "officially" at 4PM on Saturday, March 9 and will be adding lunch once they get their legs under them.  I've asked my name to be engraved on a chair, as I plan to spend quite a bit of time here!   Prost!

Still a fan! Had the burger which was meaty, well-seasoned and juicy, the crab dip which was rich and creamy (had to ask for a few more crackers, which were happily provided) and the mac & cheese, which had the nice tang I look for in a sharp cheesy dish -- and enough cheese that you had to twirl your fork to break the strands!

Some highlights on the current menu:  ~buttery, moist, delicious sand dabs (a delicate, sweet flat fish) and an ample portion. ($18)  ~smokey okra, complimented by pepper jelly that is reminiscent of something you dip egg rolls in -- never had okra or don't think you like it? THIS is the one to try! ($6)  ~and my VERY favorite: baby acorn squash. Hard to do this tiny treasure justice with mere words! The presentation uses the squash as a bowl with the top cut to form a sweet little lid. You dip your teaspoon in and come up with a rich, creamy, simultaneously sweet and savory, tangy heaven! ($10) The first two items could be shared but I encourage every body to get their OWN acorn squash!

Just hosted a gold party with these folks after attending one hosted by Yelper De Anna L. I have to say, it was a little tough to find people who still had gold - so many have had their homes burglarized :( But, it was great for those who had gold to sell! My guests made money, I made money and De Anna even made money! It was a great way to rustle up some cash for the holidays.  They buy all types of gold ~ white, yellow, and tri-colored.  That can be unused or broken jewelry, coins, or even dental gold (though that is gross!).  They also buy platinum and silver that is marked "sterling" or ".925". Jewelers will remove and return any stones that your guests may want to keep. And, you get them back along with your check right there on the spot!    Hosting a party was really easy. I just called and picked a date. There was no back and forth or negotiating. They made the date work. I was sent an email to use as an invitation if I wanted (I used facebook).   The buyer needs table space with good lighting and a nearby electrical outlet.  They also raffle off cash prizes to those that sell gold at your party, and your guests can come in at any time while they are there so you can do an "open house" format.   Unfortunately, something happened (hopefully nothing tragic) and the guy who was supposed to do my party could not be reached. Janet, the woman who schedules the parties, was so responsive -- calling me to check if he had arrived yet and arranging for a coworker to pick up the party. He was here in no time and was very friendly, polite and professional.   Channel 15 Investigative Team compared gold buyers in the Valley and Valley Goldmine came  out FAR ahead of the "competition" with the best prices!   I would totally recommend hosting a party if you know anyone who still has gold!

Nice place for happy hour which runs until 6 PM, although a traditional cocktail will still set you back $9, there are drink specials. Five food items are available for $5 and offer a nice light dinner option.   I recently had the ruben sliders and would absolutely recommend them! You get two 2.5" sandwiches on a tasty pretzel bun and a handful of fries.

Horchata and carne asada super nachos!   Ordinarily I have no problem passing up horchata, especially given that I prefer to get my calories from food over drink, but this horchata is too good to pass up!  And, the super nachos? The best nachos around!* Loads of chips with enough cheese to go around and a generous serving of your meat selection (I encourage carne asada) with a scoop of guacamole (pickled jalepenos upon request). It's such a big serving, it is easily enough to share.  *I prefer "fake" cheese over shredded cheese on my nachos. I believe cheese preference can make or break nacho satisfaction.

If you want orange chicken, here's a place to do it "local"!  Decent price and fresh compared to a nearby chain, for example...   Had the General Tso. It wasn't spicy, which would have been preferred, but I like that it's all white meat chicken and am looking forward to going back and trying some other dishes. I'll just be sure to tell them I want it "spicy!" :)

Wow! Fresh, flaky, moist, delicious haddock in a light dusting of cornmeal in the desert!   I actually wound up getting my order to go and it gets wrapped in butcher paper in such a way that it creates a handle --too cool!   Brought it back to my desk to eat and got pulled into meetings after just a few bites, but you know what? Even when it was cold, it tasted good. It did not get gummy or soggy. Of course, I do not recommend eating it cold. I'm just saying that's the quality we're talking about here.   Ordinarily, I douse my "fish n chips" in vinegar but it just didn't feel right with ADA's. No vinegar or lemon required. :)  This place is destination worthy! Two-thumbs up!!  (it's tucked away in the corner. don't miss it!)

Pizza donuts. I seriously think they should rename the garlic knots to be "pizza donuts." They are absolutely delicious and the portion is ridiculously huge... which is OK with me! Imagine the texture of a slightly crispy cake donut with a slight hint of garlic complemented with the delicate tang of a sweet marinara... pizza donuts!   The pizza is good too... we had the meatball which is a house specialty and they boast that it is spicy. It is indeed! I thought perhaps a little too spicy... but the quality of the ricotta on the pizza was perfect! Still firm and delivering a mild, milky flavor.  There are some good beers to choose from on draft to wash it all down.   This is NOT your run-of-the-mill strip mall pizza place! Definitely worth checking out!

The ambiance is awesome. The décor... the architecture... the diversity and overall use of space... and perhaps my lack of enthusiasm is largely influenced by the service (or lack thereof) but my brunch experience was a disappointment.   I had the grapefruit brulee and the beet salad.   The beet salad is served on a bed of herbed ricotta and while generally good, was nothing noteworthy. I would've liked a piece of bread or crostini to accompany the plate.  The grapefruit was effectively bruleed -- which is not an easy task, if you'd ever tried it at home.  However, no one took the time to section the grapefruit and it was not served with a grapefruit spoon. I realize this may sound petty but the ambiance and the menu descriptions lend themselves to a more upscale experience.   When I requested a spoon (since none -- serrated or not -- was brought with my food), I was given a large soup spoon which was not a practical option for a grapefruit (-- bruleed or not).   On a second request, I was brought a sundae spoon which was better sized but lacked the serration.  Honestly, I feel ridiculous typing this because I realize it sounds so menial but in addition to being a peeve, the utensil exemplified the ineffective service.

Margit is tucked away on the far east side on the 2nd floor of a building housing Macayo corporate offices. She shares space with a counseling office. I discovered her thanks to a Groupon gifted to me and enjoyed it so much I bought my own and one for a friend! The pressure was perfect and she did a great job focusing on my expressed needs on each visit. The thing is: her pricing is super reasonable and you really don't even need a Groupon to make a massage fit in the budget! I also love the fact that she has appointments on Saturday and Sunday!
