I must say I did not fully experience this restaurant, So I am only reviewing by the quality of their clam chowder and the little bit of service i received while I was in the establishment.  The chowder was so-so. It is the best I have found in the immediate area so it might be worth going to if you're nearby and have a craving. However for the portion you get it in pretty expensive. I have had better chowder at a lower price.  The service was old school, no non-sense, I kind of liked it. The atmosphere is pretty dumpy and kind of creepy. I wouldn't recommend women walk across the parking lot alone. In fact I might pack heat if I ever visit again, some of the biker dudes next door were looking at me like they liked me.

I recently started riding a little Kawasaki back in forth from work to save gas. I needed a helmet but didn't want to spend a lot of money, just wanted something that works (it's a 100cc bike, I've already failed at looking cool). I knew nothing about helmets so I went to these guys for some help. The staff was available and very helpful. There was a huge selection in stock, so it wasn't difficult to find the right helmet for me. Multiple staff members checked the helmet to make sure it fit me properly. An overall great experience in a retail store, which is rare for me. Great business, I'll be going to them for all of my bike gear.

This shop is fair priced and fast. This is the only auto shop I don't dread taking my truck to. The guy who runs it seems like a cool guy too.

I scored a date a few nights ago with a really fine looking woman and I knew I needed to take her somewhere special. I was out of ideas for good food so I asked my sister in law and she recommended this place, so i rolled the dice and took her to Windsor, it did not disappoint. The atmosphere was just right for a date, not awkwardly silent, but not too loud to have a nice conversation. The menu was manageable, yet still had something for everyone. She had the veggie stack, which sounds terrible to me and loved it. I got the loaded chips, a hot dog, and macaroni and cheese (I felt like eating like a 9 year old... an overweight 9 year old).  It was delicious. The service was great too, not one thing to complain about. I give the credit for this successful date to Windsor. Needless to say I have already locked in another date. I will be going back.
