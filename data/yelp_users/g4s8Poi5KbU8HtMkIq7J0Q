Don't know what's going on with this company, I've used them 4 times in the last 12 years, things keep going down hill from the first time I used them.. This time the crew lead kind of argued with me about how I wanted my Chineese Elm trimmed.  I'm not an idiot, and I know how not to butcher a tree. But I'm not going to do the work, because I don't have the equipment to haul the mess away. In the end I had to argue, I felt like I was being talked down to, and I did not get what I was hoping for. Only the lead spoke English, it made it kind of hard to communicate what I was expecting. Lead kind of talked down the sales guy too.  I'm not sure I'm going to use them again, I'll have to see how I feel about this last visit. Mixed review here...

Service department never got things right on the first trip. Always required 2 and 3 and sometimes 4 trips to the service department to fix a problem. Some were fixed and some never were. I finally gave up on this place, because I got so tired of the less than average jobs they were doing to fix my vehicle. I will not be going back to this business, ever, if I can help it. I don't trust them..

Great tasting food, the place is a little noisy and a table for two inside is very small. We had to keep moving plates, S&P glasses etc around to keep them from falling to the floor. Service was slow at first, but once our waitress started, she was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Worth the money.  I'll go there again for sure!

I met some friends at this place, it was my first time at this bar. I liked the patio and the bartender seemed to appreciate our business. Always a friendly smile. I wish the outside barstools weren't anchored in it concrete though, it made it difficult for everyone in our group to have a seat at the table. There was no way to add another seat to our group. Kind of a bummer.

Went for happy hour Sunday, ordered a Sangria. It was so bitter I couldn't drink it. The waiter didn't charge me for it when I said I just couldn't stand it. Thanks for that.. Ordered a plain vodka martini instead. "Well" nothing fancy, $10.00 !! During happy hour? Ordered a Cezar Salad, very very ho hum..  Won't do that again. Finished with a $6.00 dessert. It was like something I could have picked up at the 2nd day bakery at Safeway. $32.00 by the time I finished. Outrageous for a so so experience. You can keep that Fox disaster. Won't be back.

Love love this place. I've been having lunch and dinner here since the day they opened. Family owned and very friendly to their customers.

I have driven by this place in the evening. The Attic is kind of a cool comfortable looking place from street level. (Indian School Road).  There are plenty of great places to hang out at in that neighborhood. I expected this place to be on par with the rest of them. I was not happy with my experience there. I couldn't tell the help from the customers. No one was in any kind of uniform at all.. The crowd seemed very college like (young and immature) the staff seemed the same way. Great for a very very young crowd, but not my cup of Vodka martini. You can keep this place. The food was not worth the money either, I tossed half of it in the trash when the busboy came by to collect our plates. I will not be going back to this place unless they bring it up several notches.
