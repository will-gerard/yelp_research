This gourmet pizza joint is on par with Patsy Grimaldi's, i.e. a close second place to Pizzeria Bianco. How do you beat the national favorite? You dont.  But that is still a HUGE compliment, as even a close comparison with PB is an honor, in my book. And, Humple pie is biting at the heels of Bianco, no doubt. I work close by, so maybe I'm partial but the pizza is fantastic. They have great variety and do all kinds well. Try the Margharita or Artichoke pizzas. The artichokes on the artichoke pizzas are huge chunks - no skimping here! The lunch special and happy hour prices are both good deals. I ordered the cold Green Bean salad at happy hour ($3 i believe) and it was surprisingly delightful and refreshing. Puts a new perspective on "salad." Also, the staff is ALWAYS friendly and helpful- even when slammed with the lunch crowd. Have yet to have a bad experience here! I highly recommend it for a nice light lunch or dinner. Its yummy!

Like all Fox restaurants (except the new Culinary Dropout at Scottsdale Waterfront), this resturant is just ok, but not great. Starting with the decor, the restaurant is light and airy, with huge windows and lots of patio seating, which is nice. However, the decor reminded me more of a yacht club in the Hamptons than a spot in Mexico. Another big plus is that the hostess (who was friendly and upbeat) gives you a white or black napkins, depending on what you're wearing. I know this seems like a small thing, but if you've ever been given a white napkin while wearing black pants, you'll know the anguish it causes. To the food: As I said above, the food is good not great, but like all Sam Fox restaurants, its overpriced. Its not offensively bad, but its not Arizona mexican. There is just no excuse for serving mediocre Mexican food in Arizona, and this is the reason why I would not recommend Blanco. There are tons of great places in this city to try for upscale Mexican food- Barrio Cafe, and Gallo Blanco are my favorites. The salsa was the worst offender. Serving salsa that tastes like Pace Picante canned salsa is not only unforgiveable, but sets the meal off on a bad foot. Try again Sam Fox.

INCREDIBLE pizza. Customer service is spotty- sometimes fantastic, sometimes a little deficient. But the pizza makes up for it. This is the place to get adventurous with your pies- last time I tried some sort of corn pizza (i think it was a seasonal special) and it was to die for! Also, their specials on Monday and Tuesdays are fantastic. See below:   "Pitcher and a Pie, Bottle and a Bowl" special  every Monday and Tuesday. Enjoy a 12 inch Parlor Pizza with a pitcher of beer for $25 or a large pasta bowl with a select bottle of wine for $35  Happy Hour Everyday From 3-6pm $2 Off Glasses of wine $3 Drafts $5 Wells

Located in a non-assuming industrial strip mall, Sleepy Dog Brewing is worth the effort to find. Lets be clear- its no Four Peaks or Gordon Beirsch in terms of food and amenities. But the beer is well-made and priced well, and popcorn is free. So, no- they don't have much of a kitchen (hummus and some small snacks are available) and frankly, I was a little surprised that the bartender didn't know more about the beers (even though she otherwise gave great customer service) but the beer itself makes all those other issues disappear. The Red Rover Irish Red first got me to the brewery because I first tried it at another bar and loved it. Its hard to find a good Irish Red in Phoenix. But the Leg Humper Hefewiezen kept me there with its clean, easy drinking taste. Its a more refined version of San Tan brewery's Hefeweizen, which can be a bit heavy for me. The seasonal dunkelweisse was also something I didn't expect to find in Phoenix and it was smooth and delicious. (Coming from Philadelphia, I'm used to a more extensive local beer selection). Finally, the Wet Snout Milk Stout was also a favorite of mine. It had a surprising complexity of taste. So much so, that I still cant pinpoint what the flavor notes I tasted were. All I know, is that it was good! For food, they are partnering with the local food trucks (which is also a reason I went) so that they can provide dinner to their customers. Its a WIN-WIN deal, I think.

Had the Buffalo BLT sandwich. The sandwich came without the blue cheese mentioned on the menu and I wasn't given any silverware before my sandwich came out. (I sat at the bar). For $17 per sandwich I expect ALOT more than what I was given. Save your money.

I was told about Dog House from a friend who signed up for the Beginner Class. I had been looking for some training for my young pug  (who thinks its funny to run away from me into on-coming traffic -true story) for a while. However, I had given up hope looking because most training was out of my price range. BUT, I heard about Leah's $99 beginner class and I signed up on a whim- It was the best thing I've done for my dog (besides vaccines!). Leah was a very knowledgeable and caring teacher. In the beginner class, we went through all the basics- sit, stay, wait, lay down, etc.  It was well worth the money- in fact I feel like i got a fantastic deal and should have paid more! Thanks Leah (Dog House)!

I called up Eric looking for a last minute massage the day before a big test, and I am so glad I did! I'll admit I was a little nervous, going to a masseuse that works in a studio behind his house, but my fears were put at ease as soon as I met Eric, who is very professional and very like-able. The studio is in a converted guest house behind his home, but the  room looks just like any other massage services room at any other spa. Also, he is extremely affordable and got the knots out of my back better than most masseuses at the over-the-top spas.  Do yourself a favor, and check out Eric @ Central Phoenix Massage.

What do you get when you cross the famed Lux Coffee bar (in uptown Phoenix) with an ASU dormitory? Open Source Project. This place is like the younger, more raw cousin of Lux-complete with a ping pong table, DJs mixing live and an impressive display of artwork. The staff was super friendly, even following up with me to make sure my mocha turned out alright and wishing me a good night on my way out. Perhaps it was because my 26 year old self stood out a bit from the 18-20 "Forever 21" crowd. Either way, I'm a fan. However, be warned- the place is loud (did I mention Ping Pong and the DJ?). So if you are going to get some serious work done, it might be wise to go earlier in the day or not at all. But if the noise doesn't bother you- I recommend a visit. I mean, sometimes you have to mix it up. right?

Mediocre bar food, mediocre beer selection. But the kicker is this: $8 draft beers. SERIOUSLY. $8. In PHOENIX.  Even assuming I wanted to see them (I am a straight female) TITS are NOT worth $8 beers- especially with a plethora of options in the area with $5-$6 drafts. This is Phoenix, NOT Manhattan on a Saturday night.   OH, and by the way, I got the monthly special beer (Sam Seasonal) which was .50 cheaper than normal. So apparently my beer is normally $8.50.   NEVER AGAIN. TOTAL RIP OFF.

I feel like Kevin Spacey in House of Cards when I eat here. Excellent BBQ spot that is a hidden gem. I'm almost afraid to write this because I don't want this place getting too crowded (for selfish reasons), but I also want it to stick around because it's some of the best BBQ in Phoenix and one of my favorite places.  All the BBQ is quality and Tuck matches it's sauces with the type of meat to create the perfect marriage of sauce and smoky meat goodness. The Turkey Breast, as mentioned by the Phoenix New Times IS a stand-out, but mostly because of its uniqueness. Turkey isn't always seen on a BBQ joint's menu, let alone with its own citrus sauce that compliments the rich, smoky flavor of the Turkey.  I love that they have $2 "good" beers which include hipster favorites such as PBR & High Life. You can pay more for "great beers" but $2 beers is a cheap buzz that I usually take advantage of!  The back patio is tranquil and I can imagine all the future hipster weddings happening here.  My only complaint is the potato salad. I want to love it, I really do. I order it every time- partially because I love potato salad and BBQ (the cooling effect of the cold mayo is in perfect contrast to smoky BBQ'd meats). The flavor is above-par and has gotten rave reviews from the New Times and Yelpers. However, the potatoes are usually under-cooked, which is so sad. However, when it comes to potato salad, I'd rather have my potatoes a bit more soft, than hard, so maybe I'm in the minority. However, the potato salad is my reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Sorry Tuck shop, I do love you!

Best company to work with EVER!! I was spending $700 a month in the summer months on my A/C. I have a historic home and was bleeding money on my A/C bill every summer. Ideal Energy came out and was able to save me $100-$115 on my bill in the summer by making my home more efficient. I don't know if the savings will be as significant in the Winter. I am a curious person so I was asking a lot of questions and their rep Alex was super helpful and patient.

I went to Pallets for lunch because I saw on their website that they have Happy hour prices "All Day Friday and Saturday". I asked to see the happy hour menu when I sat down and the waitress told me it wasn't happy hour time. I told her about the website saying it's all day Friday and Saturday but she said that wasn't right and that the computer wouldn't let her put in happy hour prices. HUGE PROBLEM. And the owner wasn't present to address this issue, which is also weird for a new restaurant.  Despite my better judgement, I stayed and ate. I ordered the crab wontons and the Las Vegas Roll (pictured).  The crab puffs were mostly cream cheese, I couldn't taste/see any crab. For $5.99, I expect to be given more than a wonton wrapper filled with cream cheese. The wontons came with some sort of indistinguishable, lack luster cream sauce that was less than sufficient to rescue the wontons. The Las Vegas role was beautifully plated, and well made (props to the sushi chef). The second star is because of this roll.  However, it wasn't enough to rescue the meal, which cost 3x more than it should have if they had honored what is advertised on their website. TL;DR- don't count on happy hour prices all day Friday or Saturday. Spent your money elsewhere.

The fried green tomato stack is my new favorite dish in all of Phoenix. ALL. OF. PHOENIX. Seriously try it.  It's only a matter of time before this dish becomes as infamous as the Stetson Chopped Salad at Cowboy Ciao. If it doesn't, it's a crime.

One word: poutine. Get it with a fried egg-the yolk and gravy make magic together.  During HH, it's only $5 and you get your money's worth!  Nook is a super friendly neighborhood joint worth investigating at least once if you live in the area. Frank, the owner, was around several times to make sure our food and service was up to his level (and to recommend the egg on the poutine, which I'm glad he did!) The pizzas are yummy but not entirely original. With the advent of so many gourmet pizza restaurants these days, I fear the lack of invention of Nook will doom it, as it has many restaurants before it. My message to Frank: your food is solid, beer selection great (yea Anchor Steam!), prices are good, ambiance is lovely-Just give me some innovation to be excited about! Also, the poutine is a knock out. Thanks for the egg ;)

My BF and I love Oven & Vine. HOWEVER, we came on a Friday night recently and were treated like SHIT by some crazy short-haired bleach blonde lady. If you see her, BEWARE.  We tried to order at the bar but we were told by her several times in a very rude manner that we couldn't get service at the bar. Every time we tried to grab an open seat at the bar, she was quick to tell us someone was sitting there. Holy cow. We just wanted to order some wine and relax at our neighborhood bar. Instead, we ordered an Uber and spent our money elsewhere.
