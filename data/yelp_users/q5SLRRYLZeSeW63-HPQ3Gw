Had lunch at Kona Grill yesterday. Had a really good time since it was happy hour. Good deals. We ordered the shrimp tempura roll, voodoo roll, and avocado egg roll. My friend loved the voodoo egg roll and will order it again the next time we go. LOVED the avocado egg rolls - good proportions and the sun-dried tomatoes added a nice touch.

The moment we walked in, the place looked like a ghost town. I didn't see any attendants up and walking around. A guy forwarded me to the back where I could pick up my tuxedo. The 3 attendants who were supposed to help me were more engrossed in the novels they were reading. I tried the tuxedo on and the pants were way too baggy. I knew this was not the way it was supposed to look, but the attendant said that's how they are supposed to be unless they took it in at the waist. I would have expected much better service like when I was fitted in the Phoenix location.

We chose Fez after picking a friend up from the airport late at night and were pleasantly surprised. Our servers were very friendly and helpful. The spinach and artichoke dip is highly recommended. My friend and I enjoyed

We were in the mood for Asian food, and the Concierge at my hotel offered Social House as an option. The bar area is pretty spacious if you prefer not to wait for a table. The wait was not excessive, and the hostess was very attentive with frequent updates while we were waiting at the bar. Our server had many options for us, and we loved the sake. We tried a good amount of sushi and grilled vegetables, that were cooked well. We will definitely return to Social House when we go back to Vegas.

A few friends and I went to Qua Baths & Spa for my birthday a couple months ago. We normally do the spa at the Encore, which we absolutely love.   It is pretty pricey if you go for a spa package. They accept SpaFinder though.  Qua is a completely different experience. I always get a deep-tissue massage, and the one I got at Qua was the best I've ever had. I enjoyed the different steam rooms, and one had a eucalyptus feel to it. The Roman bath toward the front is massive and you can lay on the heated stone chairs forever. It does get crowded, so don't look forward to too much solitude or quiet. One of my friends had never been to a spa before, and he didn't want to leave when it was time for dinner.   The only thing negative I could say is that the attendants did not offer to provide a tour for newcomers. Although I don't need it, my friends mentioned they would enjoy an outdoor area to relax.

I just got back from Vegas a couple days ago and spent 3 nights at Encore and the last night at the 4 Seasons for a wedding. I've stayed at the Encore before, and it's absolutely the best. If you're into a cool scene, the clubs are great, and so is the atmosphere. The staff always greet you, and the concierge is truly helpful. I asked for Asian restaurants at the CityCenter, and the concierge was very knowledgeable and honest. We had a lot of luggage and garment bags, so when the bell came to pick our stuff up, we were ecstatically surprised to see our car ready waiting at the valet with everything already packed. We had left the room the same time the bell man left. That kind of service is unmatched. The pool is a great place to hang out and meet new people, the music is trendy with good remixes, and the servers are very attentive. The Encore spa is absolutely amazing. Quite large steam room and sauna. There are 2 hot tubs that are massive, and the rain showers are the best. You can adjust the music, lighting, and jets. The best place to stay on the strip for luxury, relaxation, and a fun time.

Friends have raved about Brios in other parts of the country, so I finally went to the one near me. Absolutely loved the Pasta alla Vodka. Handmade pasta filled with ricotta cheese, bits of prosciutto, in the best vodka sauce ever. My friend ordered the crab cakes & also loved them. Great service, nice atmosphere, all around wonderful dining experience.

Our table wasn't ready by our reservation time, but the manager made up for it with complimentary cocktails and our server extended the happy hour specials. Great atmosphere, live music was nice, my date's sea bass was cooked perfectly and so was my steak. My date enjoyed the oysters. For a bit of elegance, atmosphere and great food, go to Eddie V's.

I've been a loyal member at this Massage Envy location for 2 years now, and have always had a wonderful experience. Never had a mixup in my appointments, always able to change my appointment if my originally scheduled one doesn't work out. I usually go to Tim and he's absolutely the best if you need deep pressure. He also offers ways to stretch and take care of your body in between sessions. I hope this review doesn't get him too overbooked.  Aside from the great service, I would definitely recommend this location because of all the shopping and errands you can get done after you're relaxed, or you can enjoy lunch or a movie.

This was the only Fox Restaurant we haven't tried, and like the others, Little Cleo's didn't disappoint. We were seated promptly, our server was very informative about the oysters and provided her favorites, some dishes came out really quickly. We decided to graze for our dinner and ordered the small dishes to share, and they were all absolutely delicious. For our next visit we will try the large entrees. Only opportunity for the experience would be that our server had forgotten a glass of wine we ordered and we had to ask for napkins a couple times.
