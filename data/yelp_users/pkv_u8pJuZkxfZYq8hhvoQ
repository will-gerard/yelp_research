My wife loves this place.   We stay here when we come up to Phoenix for the Cardinals games.  It's a bit dated, but this is an excellent place to stay on the west side of town.  The restaurant and bar close too early when there's a Sunday or Monday nite game, which is something they should reconsider as people will return to the resort for something to eat or a nitecap as they are all wired from the game, especially if the Cards had won.    The food is good and be careful of which rooms you stay in.  Some need a major rehab in terms of windows opening or the locks working.   The room we have had for the past couple of stays was so good we could have moved in and never left.   The gym is good, but a bit snooty from some of the local residents who obviously have memberships in the facility.

This is a great place to eat, although it is VERY busy.   Made reservations for a Saturday night and arrived 30 minutes early.   There was no way they could seat us early.  As my guests don't drink, the bar was not an option.  So we sat.  And sat.  And sat.  The food and service was excellent.   I would highly recommend anything at this restaurant as my guests were very satisfied.   It's an old style classy high end steakhouse.   This will impact on your wallet, but would may find it worth it.

Had a wonderful dinner this evening.  Ordered off he vegetarian menu and had the quinoa risotto.  Excellent.   Wine is expensive, but the food is top notch.  Sit on the patio overlooking the golf course if you can.  Service is excellent, and you are given plenty of time to not your meal at your own speed.  Definately will eat here again when in Vegas.

Have tried twice to have breakfast here and both times the wait was prohibitive.  Gave up both times and will not try again.  What can one do to eggs to make people want to wait on long lines to eat?  Don't know if this place deserves four or five stars, but not having eaten there, I can only give a one star rating because when you're hungry you should be able to eat.

Came here on the advice that this was to be the best burger ever!  Place is crowded and very popular.  But, hey, it's Vegas and this has the name of a celebrity chef on it.  Ate at the bar.  Comfortable spot, games on tv's.  Servers professional but not that friendly.   Food was good.  A solid good, but not out of this world.   What else can I say?   Been here, done here.  Would not go out of my way to return.

Could not get into the Black Bear diner so we started looking around for a place to have breakfast before we started a trip.  Came across this place and it was not crowded, although the food is good enough for it to be crowded.  Have the breakfast sandwich. It was great.   The country potatoes are not that could, so stick with the hash browns.   Nice spot.  Will come again.
