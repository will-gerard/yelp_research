Worst hotel experience ever. The rooms are dirty with wet stains on the carpets and dirt on the walls. The bathrooms are a joke - I've seen better at Motel 6. The beds are not comfortable and the walls are thin, so you get to hear screaming children day and night.  But what tops it all off as the worst hotel ever is the awful service. 2 hours and 15 minutes to get food (we never even got seated) because the Lobby Grill cannot stop checking their cell phones long enough to seat people. Coupled with the rudest desk managers (Zoey and Stephanie) and you have the worst customer service at a hotel ever.  Avoid this place at all costs! The water park is NOT worth the hassle of a place that overbooks and under serves.

Amazing Bears Bar with a true Chicago feel. Excellent bar selection and great service. The highlight is definitely the entertainment. Darts, pool, video games, and SO MANY TELEVISIONS! This is THE place to watch football.

I didn't even get to go in and try the food or drinks. Why? Because the manager decided to corner me in the parking lot and scream at me.  It was an event day on Mill which means parking sucks. My boyfriend and I were there for the event, but wanted to stop at Monti's first for a drink and an appetizer. I didn't see the booth that apparently I was supposed to pay for parking at - a sign would help, a small child sitting in the bushes who collects the money does not help.  We parked, and as I got out the car the manager at Monti's ran up to me and started literally yelling at me, telling me I couldn't park there. I asked why and he said because I wasn't eating there. My, what a grand assumption to make considering I parked AT THE RESTAURANT. I guess he's used to people parking and not eating there - I can't image why.  I was happy to pay for parking, I told him, and was going inside for drinks. He proceeded to doubt me and say that I "better go inside then". Way to threaten me, bro.  I said eff that and paid the kid near the booth $5 (though the manager told us it was $10- what a liar!) and told the manager that I don't want to eat at a place where someone is going to yell at me.  So yeah, Monti's, I will never know your food - because you are rude.

I guess I'm the minority that has gotten great service from Cox.  I got the preferred service for my tiny apartment, along with a new (pricey!) modem and router that was Cox compatible (from Fry's Electronics) and never had a problem with slow or disconnected internet.   I know that's not everyone's situation but I did want to point out why I gave them 5 stars...  The best customer service I've ever experienced with a big brand. Every time I called and had a question they were kind, helpful, prompt, and informed. I also received no hassle from canceling (only canceling because I'm moving into a place that already has Cox) and it was a simple process. How refreshing!

Go here if you like your food cold, your card overcharged, your waitress rude, and your customer service idiotic!  My coworkers and I used to go here 3 or 4 times a month for lunch and happy hours (about 10 or so of us each time) and always had wonderful service from the bartenders. One Friday for lunch we sat at a table as it was someone's birthday. Long story short, the waitress -forgot- about our food for over 45 minutes (we were on a work break, keep in mind). The manager SAW THIS HAPPENING and did nothing because, in her words, "we looked like we were having fun so she didn't want to interrupt". Thanks Cricket (honest to God that's her name).  She then gave us giftcards (3 of them despite having a party of 10) and trotted away merrily.  On top of our food being atrociously late, myself and another were charged $7 over and when bringing it up to the waitress, she cheerfully said, "it's okay you're still getting the same food!" What the eff?   So with our food cold (and 3 of the orders wrong) we went back to the office and I complained on Twitter. Deborah from marketing responded to me with her email and myself and 2 coworkers sent very polite, but detailed emails expressing our displeasure. In response, Deborah found it appropriate to blame it on short staff and said she'd take us out to lunch there.  It's tacky, rude, and awful customer service to send the same generic, premade email to all of us. Second, I'm not an idiot. They weren't short staffed (there was NO ONE in the restaurant), our food was CLEARLY ready on time as it was ridiculously cold when we got it. Finally, why the hell would I want to go back after I just told you how awful it was?  In short, the food here is not worth the absolutely awful service. If you're at Scottsdale mall and want to eat, walk the 10 feet over to the Yard House. Their food, drinks, waitstaff, and customer service are infinitely better. Even go to Culinary Dropout, Kona Grill, or any of the 15 other places around. Don't waste your money (as they'll overcharge you) on a place like this.

Been here 3 times, twice for drinks and once for food. Each time I've been 100% satisfied. The service is quick and friendly, the decor and seating are perfect, and the food & drinks are delicious.   We ordered the pizza and it's great - it's not that weird flatbread stuff with sparse toppings, but it's also not a greasy mess. The perfect medium! We also were treated to the pear salad which was very good.  Oh, and they certainly don't cheat you on drinks. The prices are fair and the liquor is plentiful - if you don't see the beer you want behind the bar, the bar next door (Amsterdam) most likely has it and they'll get it for you.  I recommend it for pre-gaming a night a out, girl's nights, 3rd dates, and after party get-togethers on the way home from Mill.

Hey, the food is great. But I can get great food anywhere downtown. What makes this place a one star is their incompetent employees and rude manager Drew.  Called ahead to ask if they had the NFL package and if they'd be showing the games for tomorrow. Employee said yes! They've have it for two months! Great, let's bring a 10+ party there and spends lots of money.  Nah, employee lied. They've never had it (why say they've had it for two months?? Such a weird lie). Rude, whatever, go to another bar instead. Spoke with the manager and said look, I know it's not your fault an employee lied. Could you maybe have a note for your employees that you don't do football?   Manager responds with "sorry that happened."  They sounded as if I had told them I stubbed my toe. I wasn't expecting a grand apology or coupon or anything, I just noted an easy way to avoid the mistake. The manager instead ignored me when I spoke and just said, I quote, "new people sometimes lie."  Yeah. I don't think pizza tastes good when it's covered in lies.
