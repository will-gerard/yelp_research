All seekers & souls are welcomed and the Light is always 'on'. Do your soul a favor & stop by to experience it for yourself. Namaste .....

Love this restaurant!  Western/Contemporary/Casual-with-FLAIR!  Their signature green chile mac 'n cheese is a do-not-miss when you eat here and the Big A*s burger is worth the extra miles on the treadmill! Only drawback:  No Live Music (hint-hint RF mngmt.......................)

Attended Kiwanis of Carefree Western Night - Dolan Ellis performing his musical history of AZ for the folks of Carefree. We enjoyed the wonderful ribs 'n chicken, fried cactus (yummy!) and the live buffalo outside (no joke!) for picture taking delight of all the guests. The resort is the epitome of desert laid-back elegance and the sunset  views are spectacular - as is the food and resort staff who greet you with a smile as you pass by on the pathways around the resort. What a fantastic place to hold an event!! I am looking forward to coming back again soon.

Delish - had the salad pizza - enough for two! And happy hour appetizers were only four dollars so you can really enjoy yourself Nice break after turkey day! Liz our server was super-attentive and very friendly.

TJ's is great - fresh, fresh tantalizing produce well displayed; good selection & pricing on organic produce; TJ's wonderful house brands in an interesting variety of great foods - but everyone knows that already.  However, the cool thing is that for some reason, this particular TJ's always has the nicest clerks & managers.  They explain stuff, make small talk and are not only friendly but N-I-C-E!!  Kudos on a great staff, TJ's!

AMBIANCE:  Trendy - Urban - Upscale Casual (small tho' - between inside & patio, only seats 99 total). Very nice modern decor - tables made of white agate suspended in some sort of lucite. Nice art on walls. Good size booths.  FOOD:  We had the famous pretzel bun burger w/fries and the Ancho Chile Reuben w/combo fries. Both were totally De-Lish!  The bacon on the burger was 100% real and cooked on a grill, just like home.  Also the red pepper aioli and bits of basil leaf added a subtle new flavor to the same ol'burger.  Burger was cooked as ordered: a beautiful med. rare.  The Ancho Chile Reuben was HUGE!  Tasty with only a hint of zing.  Crispy fries rounded out the huge plates & portions are large so come hungry (combo fries are the crispy fries and sweet potato fries mixed in together- great for sharing).  We had tea as a beverage - fresh brewed and excellent.  SERVICE:  Everything was great -with one exception:  our waiter never asked us if we wanted more tea.  He was back several times - asked if we wanted dessert, etc.  He was nice, friendly, pleasant & accomodating when we needed an extra minute to decide on our order. But, not offering a refill on the drinks (the glasses were empty before our plates were) made a difference for us in the tip:  would have been 20% but instead left only about 16%.  OVERALL:  We did not have a long wait time as others described.  May be because we were there at 3:45 p.m. on a weekend and not a busy meal hour during the work week. Food was absolutely excellent and we will definitely be back - gotta try the Breakfast Nachos!

Lovely interior but average to below avg. food and definitely over-priced for the quality of the dishes. This was my second time at Brio - first time was lunch and food was fine (Strawberry/Chicken salad) but service (for 2) was terrible! It took 40 min. & 2 inquiries after ordering to receive the salads. At the time I thought, while the salads were good (not great or unique) it wasn't worth the wait or the high prices, though the restaurant itself is lovely. Also, I had to ask for a table that wasn't next to the loud clanging of the open kitchen so my friend & I could talk without shouting. So, 8 mos. later my 17 yr. old wants to celebrate his birthday where? Yup - table for 5, dinner, please! I will say the server was very nice & very accommodating. However, once again we found ourselves seated right next to the open kitchen & we were told all the tables for 5 were by the kitchen - so we shouted over the din (restaurant was only 1/2 full?). So, with entrees from $18.95 - 23.95 we opted for the "Dinner Special" an all-inclusive 3 course meal (3 entrees to choose from) for $16.95 ea., (beverage extra) and the ravioli appetizer.  The appetizer was delicious - only 4 large ravioli for $14.95 though and the Chicken Milanese ordered by 3 of our 5 was enjoyed. I tasted it and it was good. My choice, the penne diavolo w/chicken tasted like spicy cheesy-Mac with tomato sauce mixed in - not great at all. Our other guest had the strawberry-chicken salad and enjoyed that. However, it was agreed that basically it's Olive Garden at twice the price in a better neighborhood. If you want authentic, true delicioso Italian food I recommend Roma Garden - same prices, not a pretty neighborhood but mamma mia, it's authentic! Or any other favorite place you love for Italian - Brio is not for foodies or anyone who wants to talk at a meal.

Normally I love chipotle and get good service at the Zocallo Plaza store. But tonight I came in to this store and the one girl couldn't figure out how to make 1 cheese & 1 steak quesadilla or seemed like she didn't want to make it & asked a guy who was just getting off work (end of shift) to do it. Then the mngr told him he had to go but I got my two quesadillas, chips and guacs, made it to the register and the cashier dumps all the food in 1 small bag! 2 nice chilled guacs thrown upside down on top of 2 hot quesadillas with a bag of chips on top! So here's what really got me: I asked for a larger bag and was told "the manager does not allow these to be given out unless you are buying at least two salads or bigger/more items"! Really??? I spent $14.51 and I am refused a larger bag??? The cashier was not budging, repeated her manager wouldn't allow it - I even offered to purchase the damn larger bag! So then I requested & got a 2nd small bag which I transferred the 2 cold guacs & chips into myself! Chipotle, you need to get a grip on your franchise operations - stores like this bring your rep waaaaay down! I won't be back here EVER!

Wow! Fantastic food! Garlic knots & authentic marinara is wonderful. Had cheese calzone & Greek salad - everything was seasoned perfectly & flavors well-balanced. Extra points for using pitted Greek olives instead of leaving the pits in or - ugh! - black olives like some places. An extra-special treat was the cannoli - perfect sweet bite to finish off the meal. If you enjoy excellent Italian flavors definitely make this your next stop for a meal.

FOOD:  Delicious and uses traditional ingredients in a tasty, unique way.  The layered chicken enchilada and filet mignon tacos are my recommendation! The $34 Carne Asada seems a bit pricey -- the filet mignon tacos at $15 seem a better value.  AMBIANCE:  Beautiful! Can't wait to come back with friends and sit on the patio with libations & food.  SERVICE:  Need training - our waiter who took our order said rice was an additional charge then the server who brought out the food said it was included (we had ordered at side of rice and then both our plates already had rice!  However, to their credit, they waived the addtional charge for the side of rice - so, we'll be back).

Best place to see a movie - hands down!  Pricey? A bit BUT -- just make sure first to go on-line and sign up/join (it's free - they only want your email addy) and you automatically receive discounts.  So, ok - you pay $9 at the reg. movie theater, right?  At iPic it's $17.50 BUT (don't choke - hear me out) ...... that also includes: free valet parking, free popcorn & m&m's and the luxury, ultra-comfy seating, silk pillow, blanket and someone to wait on you!  You would easily pay $8.50 more for the popcorn & valet alone.  As a working Mom the idea of relaxing with a movie, excellent food & libations and someone else serves, prepares & cleans up is a no-brainer for a great night out!    No, it's not really the place for a budget conscious, family night out ---- there are already places for that anyway.  If you want a fabulous date night that's not the same old boring restaurant or night club then give iPic a whirl -- you won't be disappointed!   P.S. I highly recommend the filet mignon sliders - 3 to an order w/chips is more than a filling & elegant movie munch.  With a Cosmo?  Heaven!

Just an update on my 3 experiences with iPic:  1) Great venue, beautiful, clean, gorgeous restrooms, pleasant wait staff & good food.  2) Saw 'True Grit' in Jan. 2011 - $17.50 per seat on a Saturday afternoon @ member price (personally purchased 4 seats & had 2 friends join us for a total of 6 seats) had great food - filet mignon sliders (3 sliders per order) WITH chips $15. Also - had a cosmo $9.00. AND - everyone got their own small FRESH popcorn bag.  3) Saw 'Harry Potter' 7/15/11 - $25.00 per seat (purchased 4 seats) - food still good but was told no chips or fries w/filet mignon sliders and price went up to $17.50 because you get 3 now instead of 2 (incorrect!). So I had to separately purchase fries! Had a Cosmo - now $10. POPCORN was stale & there was only 1, slightly larger bag for every 2 persons to share!  4) Just bought 3 tix for Saturday afternoon matinee show  - AT FULL PRICE OF $27 PER TICKET!! When I asked about the "member price" I was told that all the previously 'discounted member price' tickets had been "promotional" and that the theater was catching up with the pricing at the other locations around the country (true, I checked), except during weekdays & morning weekend shows! Needless to say, I was a BIG fan of iPic previously - telling my friends what a great experience iPic is & justify the $17.50/per ticket with the free valet & free popcorn. Now:  I am no longer a fan.   In fact, the only reason I purchased the tickets at $27 each is because I promised a new, fantastic movie experience to my 80 yr. old mother who will join us.  But really folks, in this economy how do they justify raising prices for less quality & quantity when they have been open less than 1 year?  No wonder there were no other seats sold for this show! I certainly hope consideration is given to the fact  that what they were doing in January 2011 was reasonable insofar as cost for goods/services received.  Because charging more for providing less is NOT. I am really hoping that at least this Sat., the popcorn doesn't taste like the giant bag of stale stuff you buy at Walmart and we each get our own bag.

This nail salon is by far the best I have been to in the North Scottsdale/Desert Ridge area.    SPA PEDI:   All the gals are great & do art work that will have your toes be the talk of all your girlfriends!    NAILS:  Wow - what can't these gals do??  Vivian is fabulous at both the pink and white acrylics and Shellac gel manicure.  She is a true artist when it comes to nails shaping when doing P&W's.  The Shellac gel mani (or Axium too) is the best mani - lasts 2-3 weeks!  The outstanding feature though is their attitude; many times you are made to feel like an intruder at other salons. Not so at The Perfect 10.  They greet you, offer bottled water, and are very sensitive to the client's mood and really do everything to ensure a wonderful experience.

Cubano Panini sandwich & Red, White & Blue salad are delish! Bakery items yummy & buttery. Kinda weird set up in the shared restroom (be sure you adjust, button & zip BEFORE you leave the stall unless you want an audience!). Great atmosphere too. Will try the yoga on the lawn class when it gets cooler.

FABulous store! An eclectic mix of vintage, repurposed finds and unique art. When you go, make sure you have some time to spend as there is lots to look at, fascinate & inspire you. A definite "must-stop " destination when out and about vintage shopping!
