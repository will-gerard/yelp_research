I had been wanting a portrait tattoo of my dog for some time, but I was very nervous (I wanted it to be perfect, it IS a portrait tat.. Very scary). I was nervous right up until I found Jessa. Once I saw her work, all of my nerves turned into excitement. Now, this is all happening 2 weeks before I'm scheduled to do a photoshoot for a "Bombshells and Bullies" calendar which will be sold to raise money for dog rescue. It just so happens my leg (where I wanted the tattoo) will be showing in the shoot, so the hustle was on. I sent an email through the shop website pleading for this piece to be done AND healed in enough time for it to make it into the calendar. Apparently Siege, knowing that Jessa was booked up for months and doesn't check her email daily, sent her a text asking her to check out my request. Jessa, knowing this would be a 7-9 hour piece, worked some magic and was able to offer me the time just 2 days after I sent the email plea. After a very long day, she was able to not only finish my piece, but perfect everything down to the last little details. I could not be happier with Jessa or the shop. They even let me, or insisted really, that I bring Wallace in for a visit. Coolest people ever and so very talented. I left being happier than I could have ever imagined. My only complaint is now all my other tattoos look like shit...

It's funny the amount of stars I am giving them is the same as the amount of hotdogs every single person ate.. They are so good you can't even stop.  Don't visit if you are on a diet. You will not be able to contain your emotions. It could get weird.  LOOOOOVE

Walked in for lunch with a group of six. The staff was very accommodating and they had a great sense of humor. I threatened a bad Yelp review if the owner let anyone else try and pay for the food other than myself, and to my delight he proceeded to yell at all of my friends obnoxiously from behind the register. He had us all rolling -  The food and drinks were great. Staff checked up on us repeatedly and brought us little treats to try from the bar and the bakery. Great experience. Clearly family owned. I don't care for Westgate at all, but I loved this place so now I have a reason to go back!

I'm giving them 5 stars and I'm rendered speechless.  That never happens... me being speechless, I mean.  Don't miss any chance you have to visit Frites Street.  Put it on your bucket list.

BAD BUSINESS!  I usually don't do this (blast people), but this I just can't let slide.  This company agreed to be a part of my Spring Fling Fundraiser a month before the event, no questions asked.  When it came down to the last day (literally 5 hours before the event), they wanted a guarantee from me that they would make $250 in sales.  I reiterated this was a fundraising event, and I could make no guarantees on their sales.  I told them I hoped they would still come since I had been promoting their business for over a month and if they had any losses, the best I could do would be to write them a tax deductible receipt for those.  And no shit, now with 4 hours left until the event, they don't even take the common courtesy to respond to that email.  That is not the way you gain customers. That is not the way you do business.  Your reputation should be your bond.  So disappointed because to love to support local businesses. That was a pretty shady way to duck out and I hope karma catches up.  We should work together in a community to support each others endeavors wether it be charitable or business. You never know the next time you need someone to scratch YOUR back... but maybe they'll just be behind you with a sharp object instead.

Best Brew house in the area. Finally some worth while establishments opening up in the west valley.. Plus they love my dogs and let me hang out with them on the patio  The burgers are fantastic and if you haven't tried the short rib/ polenta dish you are really missing out!
