Never go to a big box store for your aquarium needs again! I wasted so much time and money and was getting semi-accurate information at best.  Aquarium Arts has been around for a really long time, and they know what they're doing! They are super knowledgeable, and also very ethical. Like they won't sell you fish that just came in because they want to make sure they're healthy. That's amazing!  Their prices are reasonable. Their fish are healthy and well cared for. I will only shop here from now on!

The Buttes is perfect for a not-too-pricey vacation that feels a little like a splurge. I have always liked this place, but it had been a while since I had been. I took my daughter for an overnight spa trip for her 17th birthday.  Narande Spa is lovely. I got a massage and facial; she got a mani/pedi. We were extremely happy with the services and the staff, and they had some awesome summer deals going on, so that made it even better.  The pool is really great; I am not even a big fan of pools or swimming in general, but they have a pretty cool set up here, so we took advantage of it and laid out for a while.  The rooms are not spectacular, but they are nice.  We will definitely go back.

I have been using this location for a few years now, and gradually the customer service has been getting worse and worse. I have finally reached my breaking point in the past few months. From the excessive wait times both inside and in the drive through (sometimes when there are no other customers waiting), to the staff's utter indifference toward customer satisfaction (I have too many examples to list here), to the mix ups and misinformation that has resulted in me having to make way too many extra trips, I would say move on and find another pharmacy. Unfortunately, I HAVE to use Walgreens as per my health insurance, but I have found a new location 2 miles from this one that is 24 hours with a drive through, and I have to say so far that the difference is remarkable.

Yum! For all those skeptics who fear trying vegan cuisine, this is the place to start. I have not had anything on the menu that I disliked, and you would never know that these dishes are completely free of animal products. The Green Burger and the Mexicali Burger totally satisfy my need to chomp into a big ol' burger, which I occasionally miss since I became a vegetarian. The Drunken Mushroom "Chicken" Bowl is amazing. All of the vegan "meats" and "cheeses" they use at Green are awesome. They even sell some of them in their mini grocery store so you can take that vegan deliciousness home with you. And the desserts... oh, boy! If you haven't tried it already, go now!

It pains me to write this, because I have been going to Boa for a LONG time... like way back when it was in its old location. And at that time, it was unbelievably good in every way.  Now it ranges from not-so-great to okay. The menu has changed a few times, and for a while, they got rid of the thing I used to order every single time: the Agnolotti Boa. Most recently, they put it back on the menu, but it didn't taste nearly as good as it used to.  And the service pretty much sucks. It's slow and inconsistent and generally not what I expect from a place where lunch for 2 can easily be over $50.  I'm not saying I'll never go back... but I won't be nearly as excited about it as I used to.

We eat here probably once a week. We have for years now... there is no better Mexican food in the East Valley as far as I'm concerned. It's family-owned establishment, so over the years, we've gotten to know everyone. For us, it's kinda like Cheers (e.g., "Norm!")... and I've noticed that they're like that with all their regulars, so I think that's really cool. That kind of thing is rare...  The food is amazing. The garlic pork roast burrito is the yummiest thing in the world, and since I became a vegetarian, it's the only thing I truly miss in terms of being a carnivore. But they have been keeping me happy even as a vegetarian. The red and green chile are SPICY. like atomic hot, so be careful. It took me a long time to get used to ti, but it's SO good. They also have plenty of non-spicy options if you're not feeling   The atmosphere and the quality of the food make it worth every visit.

I cannot say enough good things about this place. This is the greatest place for women's health care and spa treatments and tons of other services.

The atmosphere is relaxed and laid back. The menu, though limited, is outstanding. At first, I was worried when realized I basically had 2 choices that maybe neither would be vegetarian friendly, but I asked and was pleasantly surprised. The food was DELICIOUS. The coffee was great. The dining patio made me feel like I had stepped into some other world, away from the rest of Scottsdale. And I don't know if they put them there or not, but I saw several Monarch butterflies floating around the garden, which just added to the ambience. I will be back!

I must say I was skeptical at first. The name didn't exactly draw me in--wasn't sure what a pasty was anyway. And when someone explained it to me, I was like, "Ew-I don't know about this." Well let's say I was very wrong! Pasties are the yummiest things ever. I dream about the Veggie Greek. Their mushroom walnut soup with fresh baked bread on the side is divine. The desserts...OMG, so amazing. Try the Shirley Temple pudding if you're a toffee lover, or the chocolate bread pudding if you're a chocolate lover. I happen to be both! The staff is friendly and takes good care of you. The location in Mesa is definitely bigger with more tables available, but we go to the one in Tempe too because it's closer to work. My only complaint, and perhaps why I didn't go with 5 stars is the way the first come-first serve seating works, especially at Mesa, because there will be a party of 2 taking up one of the huge booths (made with real church pews--how cool is that?) even when there are smaller tables available, and then our party of 4-6 will have to hang around and wait. But it is always worth the wait :)

Before I became a more discriminating Groupon consumer, I purchased a Groupon for a "Relaxing Ultrasonic Facial and Microdermabrasion" which claimed to be regularly priced at $129 (Groupon price $39). I love microderm and I love facials, so I bought it without really looking into the establishment at all.  When I finally called to schedule, I was told that they were in the middle of moving locations and to call back in 2 weeks. That was a little off-putting. I called back and scheduled an appointment, and I could tell at this point that I wasn't dealing with a true "spa."   Finding the place was a bit challenging, not only because the new location is a bit off the main street and the address isn't clearly marked, but because the sign on the salon has a different name. I don't know if that's what it was called before they moved into the space or if they're changing their names or what, but it was confusing.  When I walked in, I realized it was more of what I refer to as a "churn and burn" nail salon (or as another reviewer called it, "swap-meet style"). This is a place where I would go for a quickie mani/pedi, but not for a facial, and especially not microdermabrasion.  There was no front desk person. All the employees were busy doing pedicures, and because I wasn't even sure I was in the right place, I was very frustrated by the lack of acknowledgement/attention/assistance upon arrival. Eventually somebody came up to me, and I showed him my Groupon, and he verified that I was in the right place. He told me to have a seat at one of the nail stations and that someone would be with me.  A full 25 minutes after my scheduled appointment time, I was taken back to the facial room by the woman whom I believe is the owner. The facial room is nothing special, even though she made it a point to tell me that she had just spent $3000 on the new bed, which is now much bigger than the bed she's used to, and it's hard for her to maneuver around it. The room is right next to the main room, and there is no music or anything, so I could hear people talking, phones ringing, etc.; not very relaxing. The facial itself was okay. The microdermabrasion machine that she used was a little different than what I'm used to; it had suction, and it was a little painful. The ultrasonic machine that she used was HOT, like uncomfortably hot. And she left me in the room at least twice for 10-15 minutes, and I think she was tending to walk-in nail clients during that time.  All in all, I was disappointed because when I think of a $130 facial, I expect a day spa atmosphere: fluffy robes, relaxing music, lots of pampering. This was not like that. My skin felt great after, so I'm not saying the facial itself was bad. The experience was not what I was expecting. I would go to this place, as I said, for a quick mani/pedi if it were cheap, but if you think you're going to a spa, this isn't it.

Yum! I love this place. I didn't even really think I liked Thai food that much until this place. Totally vegetarian friendly, inexpensive, fast, and delicious. The signature dish, Thai Basil, is awesome. The curries are too. Every member of our family can find something they like, and that almost never happens for us!  I would probably give them 5 stars, except that one time, my friend ordered her food with extra eggplant, they brought her dish with almost no eggplant, and then when we asked for additional eggplant, they told us it would be $2 extra, which was kind of uncool.

I had a bunch of small white gold and diamond old items-rings, earrings, a pendant-and I was just bored with them. I found Muralt's using Google, wanted to support local businesses in my city, and really support the revitalization efforts of Old Mesa.  Matt is the nicest guy, and he took all of my old stuff and made it gorgeous and new for a really great price. I couldn't be happier with the jewelry he designed and created for me. I highly recommend Muralt's!

First, I should say that working out is definitely not my favorite thing in the world. But I got on sort of a fitness kick just over a year ago. I did the regular gym workout thing, then tried a variety of DVD's, like P90X, when I got tired of going to the gym. I felt like I was in pretty good shape, and I had lost a little weight and toned up some... but I hated the routines and I was bored out of my mind.  When Ballet Fusion Fitness opened up, I thought it was too good to be true. I have a ballet background, and I had been wishing for quite some time that I could find a ballet-based workout that I could do without feeling like an idiot, since I'm way past my ballerina days. I started the classes in August, and not only did they kick my butt and make me hurt in all the right places, the classes were SO FUN! I was hooked immediately.  I have been going regularly since. I have gone from a size 6 to a size 0-2. I am more flexible now than I was when I was actually dancing, and I am super lean and toned, more than I ever was able to achieve with any of the traditional workouts I have tried. I started with 2 classes a week, but quickly started doing 3-5, mostly because I enjoy it so much, which is a huge testament to the studio's owners and the awesome workouts Lisa has created. And they continue to add new instructors and a greater variety of classes and class times, so you can keep it new and interesting.  You get your first class for free, and the pricing plans are flexible and totally reasonable. I highly recommend this studio to anyone, whether you have a dance background or not.

I had my windshield replaced recently. The scheduling process was so easy, and I didn't have to spend any time on the phone. The technician called before he arrived, and he was very courteous and professional. He did a great job, and he even rescued all my parking and service decals and put them on my new windshield for me! I will use Safelite for all my future auto glass needs.

So good! I was impressed. The place is tiny and super kitschy, and it is perhaps not the fastest place. But the servers are friendly, the food is delicious, and I can't wait to go back! Seriously, I had no idea vegan pies could be so delicious. I highly recommend Bragg's!
