After reading the other reviews for this company on Yelp, I called to get an estimate. They scheduled a time to come out the next day. Five minutes after I hung up they called me back and told me that they are in Chandler and I am at Tatum and the 101 so that would be a long drive for them. He instructed me to measure the windows myself and call them back for an estimate! I was STUNNED. I have to replace all of the screens on my house so this would have been a $1500 to $2000 order. Also, I am on Yelp telling others about my experience and sharing it on Facebook and Twitter. What a stupid move! Apparently, the sun screen business is SO good that they don't need any more business especially from North Phoenix.

Hey Robert, thanks for the great job, time and effort you exerted when doing our carpets last night.  Even though it was early evening you took your time, showed care for the carpets and did a great job.  We worked with our last company for over 12 years and we will DEFINITELY be working with you now. Thanks again.

Just had Rob back again. AWESOME job this time. (As always)  Called to let us know he was on his way and showed up on time.  My carpets are super clean again.

I have organized and held an event at this hotel twice. The staff is amazingly pleasant and helpful. They have gone way above and beyond what I would ever expect and always done it with a smile on their face and a great attitude. And, the rooms are great and most importantly clean. I actually stay at the hotel even though I live ten minutes away because it is such a great experience.
