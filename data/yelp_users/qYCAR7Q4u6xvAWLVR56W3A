My mom has been a regular at Ide Mania for years and also takes my 17 year old brother with curly hair there, but they don't Yelp.  She absolutely loves this place so it's always the go-to place for gift certificates for her birthday, Mother's Day, and Christmas.  My family was even nice enough to get me a gift certificate which I was used for an amazing 1-hour spa pedicure and a bunch of products.  Every time I've gone in there for gift certificates, to stop in and say Hi to my Mom while she's getting her hair done, or for products they've always been so funny, warm, professional and nice.  My mom and brother who go there both have curly hair and Lettie knows exactly what to do and how to make their hair look the way they want.   My 17 year old brother has been able to grow out his curly hair from short to about to a little above the shoulders, but it's cut/shaped really well so it always looks really good even between haircuts.

I first discovered the Coffee Lady through a deal website.  I live down the street so I figured I'd check it out, get breakfast and coffee while getting some work done on my laptop.  The breakfast sandwich (egg, ham, cheese, on their AMAZING multi-grain toast) is one of the best I've ever had!  Coffee is so-so, wasn't very strong, but tasted good.  The service is what I have an issue with.  Every time I went there (a total of 3 times) was planning on hanging out for a while.  On my second visit, as I was using my prepaid online deal thing, the Coffee Lady rang me up and I gave her cash for the small difference in price between my certificate and what I owed.  While she was getting change for the cash I gave her I slipped $3 into her tip jar (which she apparently didn't notice-but t doesn't matter anyway!)  and when she handed me 50 cents back, I put that into the tip jar too.  Awkward/uncomfortable/rude service moment next!  She scoffed and commented on how LOW my TIP was!!!  Are you kidding me???  1)  Just because you THINK someone is giving you a low tip, it is SOOOO RUDE to comment on it and try and make them feel bad about it  2) I really DID tip $3 on my coffee and breakfast sandwich and really just wanted to take my $3 right back out of the jar that second.  But I didn't.  I stayed, waited for my food, coffee and left later. 3)  If someone doesn't have extra money to tip you at a walk up coffee shop, it really isn't that big of a deal that you need to make them feel publicly shamed.    The decor is cute and home-y inside, there are plenty of tables, very unreliable wifi, good breakfast sandwich, bleh coffee and crappy service.

I really wanted to rate them higher, but given the OUTCOME of our interactions I don't think it's warranted. Here's why I'm giving a 1-star rating:  the $692 tree we paid for 2 weeks ago went missing (was sold to someone else!), they won't offer us a similarly full mesquite tree in exchange for the same price, we waited at home all day for delivery and do not have the tree we paid for 2 weeks ago.    We used to live off of Glendale and would pass by the nursery on a regular basis, and we even lived a street over from the owner (we know through a mutual neighbor).  So when it came time for us to start our big landscaping makeover by buying a big shade tree for the west side of our house it was easy to say, "Hey let's go support our old neighborhood nursery."    On a Saturday a few weekends ago (6/13) we showed up in the afternoon, and had to wait quite a while for someone to help us.  Eventually Nick helped us and could not have been a nicer, more helpful guy to work with.  He helped us find the type of tree we wanted (lots of shade, very full already, desert adapted tree/lower water use), didn't hesitate to pull out the tree we liked (which we took pictures of, then paid for).  We signed the paperwork, agreed to take delivery on 6/25 and excitedly waited 2 long weeks through the blazing hot Phoenix summer for our new shade tree to arrive.  In the meantime we prepped our yard by moving gravel, had all of the utilities marked and got a landscape design outlining the other plants that we'll be purchasing.  Today (6/25) we get a call in the afternoon saying that our tree is missing.  That's weird, how does a giant tree go missing?  Well, no one knows--it just is.  The best they can do is offer to send some other smaller trees (but same box size) out to see if we want those.  We wait for those, agree that they're definitely not comparable to the tree we picked out and have to pass on them.  I call in and talk with Matthew (also a nice guy) and the best they'll offer is a refund of our delivery fee.  We'd prefer to be offered a full mesquite (which may be a larger box size) since that is what we picked out.  At this point we're $700 into an overall large landscaping plan/budget, we've wasted 2 weeks and a whole day waiting at home without an acceptable resolution.    I really enjoyed working with Nick, talking with Matt on the phone, and the guys who brought the trees for us to look at were nice as well, but the end of the day we still haven't gotten what we paid for.

Whitfill Nursery has been very pleasant to work with on every transaction--even one in which they told us they couldn't find the tree we had purchased 2 weeks prior.  That was a frustrating experience, but in the end they made it right for us.  They brought over two other full mesquite trees from their Southern Ave location to the Glendale Ave location for us to consider as replacements for the tree we had originally picked out.  They weren't as perfect as the original tree we had picked out, BUT they gave us a discount and got it delivered practically the next day.  We agreed on a tree on Saturday afternoon and it was planted first thing on Monday morning.  We worked with Nick, Matthew and the delivery/planting guy Raymond (I think).  Everyone was very nice.    FYI, The Southern Ave location is 20 acres vs the Glendale Ave location's 5 acres.  I'll definitely be checking out both stores when we're ready to start buying trees and plants for our back yard soon!  Since we wanted to make sure we got the best tree we could, I comparison shopped at Moon Valley Nursery and I was happy to see that Whitfill definitely has better prices and larger trees for the same box size.  Moon Valley had very pretty looking mesquite trees (nice shape), but they weren't as full and they were significantly ($300-$500) more expensive for the same size (36" box).  Also, Moon Valley had a used car sales kind of vibe to me in that they don't have standardized prices for their box trees.

A huge monsoon storm came through our neighborhood a few days ago and uprooted mature trees, knocked over walls, a semi truck, and generally caused a huge mess.  Luckily the mesquite tree that Whitfill planted for me 2 months ago was staked and didn't uproot, but did fall down to about a 45 degree angle and one of the stakes snapped.  I called the next day and Whitfill Nursery kindly agreed to come out within a few days and stand the tree back up and stake it again.  They came today (2 days after I first called) and added lots of stakes to get us through the rest of the monsoon season, and the tree looks better than ever! Now that it is upright again I can see how much it has grown (tall) and filled out in only 2 months.  I really appreciate them standing by their warranty even though damage due to weather is not explicitly covered.

I came here on lunch to have a pair of stiletto heels repaired. Lucas asked if I wanted to wait 10 minutes while he repaired them.  I decided to wait in my car parked right out front (planning on coming in after 10 minutes) but just before the time was up, he came to my car and brought my shoes to me.  It was great! I handed him cash for the repair and he handed me my newly repaired and shined shoes! I'll definitely be coming back as I've got some more heels that need to be repaired!

I'm a regular donor here.  They've always been pretty friendly and the donation process as easy as can be.  I've been donating with UBS since 2002 and the process is pretty standard. In non-blood donation situations I get queasy at the sight of blood, but I have no fear with these guys because I know I'm in good hands.

I used to live pretty close to this place and would come here every so often for lunch or dinner.  I was always very happy with my food.  I can't think of a single complaint I have about this place so that's definitely a good sign.  The service is always friendly, the food is as good as any greek food I've tried and the prices are pretty decent.

I found Toro Construction through a neighbors recommendation on Nextdoor.  I also read the Yelp reviews and searched through the registrar of contractors to make sure everything was good.  We needed our old wood and chain link (2-layers of fence!) fence taken down and replaced with colored block with several good quality gates and knew it was going to be a big job (price-wise for us).  I got a few quotes from different companies and no one could compete with Dan at Toro Construction on price and service.  Dan was a pleasure to work with the whole way through.  We love our new block fence and gates!  The quality of work is excellent.

I have been there twice for laser hair removal on my arms.  It is a bit of a drive for me, but it is definitely worth it for the great service, and wonderful atmosphere.  Even when I've driven across town in rush hour traffic, I'm immediately calmed by the relaxed atmosphere, cool air, pleasant music and nice but home-y decor in this place.  The laser technicians and front desk women have been nothing but nice, and I would highly recommend coming here for services.  Just to clarify, I also bought the Groupon deal like the previous reviewer and there was a misunderstanding about what it covered (arms in my case) when I arrived for my appointment even though I had called and spoken with them to confirm otherwise when making my appointment.  I thought I had my bases covered, but was apparently told over the phone that my treatment covered more than it was really supposed to.  I was ready to just leave instead of paying the difference because I felt like I had done my part to make sure I understood what I was buying (and therefore would have bought more if I thought I was supposed to).  Since it was the owner who told me the wrong info over the phone and had set my appointment they were able to accommodate what was promised over the phone and keep me as a customer.  Even during the initial confusion of my first appointment they were very nice, I left feeling like it was an honest mistake and I have had a great 2 appointments so far.

We just finished up a 6 day stay on the 12th floor of the Mandalay Bay and were pretty disappointed.   We were there for a conference, which by the way is still a very long walk from the rooms.  Self parking is free, but there didn't seem to be any way to get help with luggage at check in.  It's very beautiful as you drive up and valet, but if you self park you have to drive around to another block and enter through the parking garage.  We had problems with a lack of hot water every single time we took a shower.  We called, they told us to let the water run for 5-10 minutes first. This did not help, and it's a pretty ridiculous suggestion when the hotel is certainly not cheap. For $250 a night I would certainly expect hot water for a shower.  After calling the first day they told us they'd send someone up to fix a valve.  Apparently this didn't happen because we had the same issue the next day.  I got in the lukewarm shower, put shampoo in my hair and then the water went ice cold.  On the third day they sent someone up who replaced a valve/shower knob, but you will never have a hot shower unless you let the water run for 10 minutes.  Our uber driver told us this is a known issue at this hotel.  Our $200+ a night hotel room included zero complimentary amenities.  No mini fridge ($40 a night if you ask), no microwave, no complimentary coffee, no complimentary water, or plastic cups (to take ice to the pool).  No complimentary late check out.  We decided to pay $30 extra for late check out, and ended being locked out of our room early anyways.  This happens a lot.  We were charged $4 for coffee that we never made in the room. We didn't touch it. We paid the outrageous prices downstairs to not have to make it ourselves and still overpay.  The feel of the hotel and room were pretty nice as you'd expect (nice new furniture, carpets, cool mural wallpaper) but my only complaint is that no matter how many lights I turned on it always felt dark at the desk where I was trying to work (I know most people aren't in Vegas to work, but just in case haha).  Having two closets, and two sinks was great.  There's no fan in the toilet area so that's a little weird for privacy/ventilation.   The beach/pool area was really cool. There's a cardio center, but I didn't try that out.  I liked that the ventilation in the casino was decent, so the smoke smell wasn't too overwhelming.  Everything is absolutely insanely expensive in general, but I guess that's to be expected in Las Vegas.  My favorite part about our stay was how friendly the cleaning, and the pool staff were.  I wouldn't stay here again unless it were free or steeply discounted.  There are way too many other options on The Strip.  My last trip here I stayed at The Westin and that was awesome. It even included a free happy hour.

I found Gene's Auto Worx through Yelp and I'm so glad that I did!  I drive a 10 year old car and was in need of some repairs, but I've always had that feeling that I was being price-gouged and not being given straight-forward, honest advice by previous mechanics shops.  My first trip to Gene's was in January.  I called around 10am and explained the noises my car was making and asked if I could bring it in that day.  He said to bring it down and they'd take a look at it.  When I got there he had me write down and describe the issues I was concerned about.  He looked at it right away and spent about an hour with me, from diagnosing the issues, personally explaining them to me and providing recommendations and advice.  All of this for no charge!    After he diagnosed the issues himself he wanted to make sure we were on the same page so we both went out to my car and made sure he was addressing the exact sounds I was concerned about (there were a few of them).  After he explained what they were and helped prioritize them and why certain repairs are more vital than others (new rotors and motor mounts), he gave me an estimate that was very reasonably priced.    They did the work the next day and were kind enough to drop  me off at my apartment while the work was being done and then pick me up later.  I went back again recently for more work (replacing the A/C and heating system) even after moving to downtown Phoenix and not only had another great experience, but he charged me much less than another A/C specialist had quoted that I found through Groupon.  I'd like to think it is because Gene has more expertise that the other place which resulted in fewer hours of labor being charged, but I have a feeling that the other place just tacked on a few extra hours of labor because most people don't know any better.  I LOVE that Gene is honest, not pushy and very nice about explaining things.  His daughter Kelly is super sweet as well.   I will definitely be going back to Gene in the future!  They also have wifi in the waiting room!

I've been coming to this location for lunch occasionally over the past year and I've always been happy with how quick and friendly the service. The food and store are pretty typical for Quizno's--good and clean.

I have lived in Tempe, gone to ASU and worked on Mill for years and  I have nothing but good things to say about the ice cream and service at this place.  The owner and staff are always friendly, the servings are big, and they're perfect for stopping by on either a hot day or late night when too many glasses of wine at Cafe Boa make Cookiez sound like the perrrrfect dessert.  I'm not saying it's good for you, but the cookies are the fresh and gigantic, and with a giant scoop of ice cream in between, it's heavenly.  Do yourself a favor and try it out. :)

Main reason for the 2 star review:  value provided for the service. I came here because it's close to my work so I wanted a place I could stop in on my lunch break.  I went with the $12  Spa Extreme wash and all it did was run me through the automated wash in about 1 minute and gave it a quick dry with the blowers. The dust was all washed off, but the car was still pretty wet with spots all over. I know this can be expected from just a quick blow dry, but $12 seems pretty excessive for that kind of limited service that took a whole 1-2 minutes at the most.  Looks like a nice new facility, but I'll be trying another car wash near my work next time around.

I live just a few blocks away (maybe not even that) and I had never stopped in until they had a Groupon deal.  I had been to Urban Bean next door half a dozen times, but I was usually too busy and every time I DID have time to stop in, it was already closed.  So, I finally made it in and I really liked it.  It could be a little more fresh and bright, but it's not unlike most used bookstores and I don't mind.  I'm really there for the well-priced books.  I was into career-oriented books at the time and found some pretty useful books all in one section.  I think I left with around 5 books.  Not bad for my first time in and only checking out one small section of the store.  One of the books didn't have a price on it, but the clerk explained that all of the books sell for half of the original suggested retail price.  I like that concept because it's really easy to figure out when you're deciding what to buy in case they forget to mark the price.    The clerk who helped me was a friendly lady who made sure to ask if I had any coupons or a punch card even before she knew I had a Groupon.   They seem to offer regular coupons and discounts if you buy multiple books which is always a draw for me.  Overall, worth checking out.  Very nice to have a local bookstore fill the void left by the closing of Borders and Bookstar (a Barnes & Noble store) down the way.

I had passed this place a million times and had been meaning to try it.  When there was a Groupon deal, of course I had to get it and try this place out. :)  The owner was polite, quiet, and friendly and the food was good.    I ordered 2 Pima Tacos (fry bread with beans, lettuce, tomato, onions) a Navajo Taco(fry bread with whole beans, lots of cheese, red chili [but you can order green if you prefer]), lettuce, tomato, onion) and Vegetable Mutton soup.  I grew up eating fry bread once a week at school and on holidays at my friends house, and must say, I loved it.  It was thick, doughy, fresh and delicious.  It made me want to come back and order something more simple next time or an extra side of fry bread.  My mom and brother liked their Pima tacos and even made an "OMG" type of comment about how yummy the fry bread is.  My mom tried the vegetable mutton (vegetable stew) and said she could tell is was fresh, homemade and good.   So I'd say it's worth trying out.  The place isn't fancy, but the people were genuine and really meant it when they thanked me for coming in....and of course, they have amazing fry bread.  I'll definitely be going back!

Love this place. It has a cool coffee shop vibe, plenty of tables, comfy couches and chairs and a bar kind of area.  They've always been super cool and friendly.  Also, they have lots of creamer options including soy, almond, and rice milk!  I've been there 5 times, usually stopping in on a weeknight after work, but once I stopped in mid-day during the week and the owner made it a point to say say Hello and ask how I found out about them.  He was very energetic, positive and seemed like the kind of person who really cares about his business and his customers.

I had my hair cut by Vanessa after letting it go for way too long.  I had just moved back to the area and 1) my hair was way overgrown 2) I wanted/needed a haircut asap 3) I didn't want to drive far.  Luckily for me I had a week day off to take care of some errands and discovered that I could book a next day appointment online.  That was awesome.  It's one of my favorite features of a salon I used to go to (near my old work--I would go on my lunch break).  Also, I got a first-time client discount!  My appointment was on a weekday at 12pm.  I showed up at 12, and Vanessa was still working with another client so I had to wait around 30 minutes.  She greeted me and offered me water/tea while I waited.  I got a little bored, but found a magazine to keep me occupied.  My haircut turned out great and overall Vanessa was very laid back, seemed to detail-oriented and was easy to work with.    My boyfriend needed a haircut (and he's usually more of the cheap guy haircut type) and went in to see Vanessa shortly after I did.  He loved it.  He told me that they even have beer available as well! I wish I had known that while I waited for 30 minutes for my haircut....At least now I know for next time, and so do you.

We called Queen of Maids on Friday afternoon when we discovered that our rental house had been left dirty by the tenants who had just moved out.  We needed it to be clean and ready for move-in immediately and one quick call to Queen of Maids took care of that within 24 hours.  The cleaning folks showed up the next day, on time and ready to go.  Since the house was empty and fridge/oven were relatively clean we asked that they take care of cleaning blinds, wiping down walls/doors/baseboards and cabinets, bathroom, sweeping, mopping, and washing the windows. They said, "No Problem" and had it perfectly clean within a few hours.  This was my first time ever using a cleaning company and I'm happy to say that I was very satisfied with the experience.

I tried Taco Guild again and the second experience was WAY better the second time around.  I'll definitely be going back.  The service was awesome, music wasn't as loud, food was amazing as always.  This time we sat at one of the high tops instead of a booth and I thought it was way cooler to be able to look around and check out the cool design of the place.  On this visit I tried the veggie tacos and they exceeded my expectations--they were tastier than my non-veggie tacos since they were marinated (I think?) roasted veggies.  We also ordered the corn and had them cut it in half, one of my favorites.  We ordered cocktails and if it weren't for the price to strength of the cocktail ratio I would have given them 5 stars.  The drinks were good!....But, for the price ($9-$11ish) they had less alcohol than I'd prefer.  That's an expensive drink in my opinion and I'm not splurging for a second one at that price if it's a lot of filler.

My review is based on my experience trying to book a block of rooms for my wedding. I received a bid for $79 for the requested block of rooms via WeddingWire and hotel planner.com which is great and comparable to the perceived quality of the hotel.  When I attempted to solidify this offer both of the sales team members Rochelle and Evelyn reneged on that offer. Rochelle told me over the phone that the rate they post on hotel planner is just a teaser rate, but not the real rate which is $112. The offered group rate of $79 is supposed to be the real rate according to their agreement with hotel planner.  Overall I'm dissatisfied with their dishonesty in posting rates they refuse to honor.  I have over 100 guests traveling to the area from out of state, and there are many other hotels in the area for us to choose from so we will have to select another hotel on behalf of our guests.

I was excited to try out this place since moving back into the area. I live about a mile away and love pizza, especially if I can just order by the slice.  My boyfriend and I stopped in last Wednesday or Thursday night and shared a salad & each got a slice.  We tried the special (it had angel hair pasta and herbs on top) and pepperoni.  The salad was big enough to split, but could've used a little more dressing. I'm sure we could have gotten more if we had asked. No biggie. The pasta pizza was more flavorful than the pepperoni and the salad was very good.  I really like the vibe when you walk up, with plants right near the entrance, murals inside with a big window and high top seating facing out so you could people watch.  Since it's an old building it has character and I like that.  It doesn't feel brand new, but doesn't feel run down or forgotten about either.  Parking could definitely be more well lit at night, but that's my only real complaint.  I also prefer more doughy/fluffy and flavorful pizza crust than what we had, but I know that's just my preference.  We decided to eat outside on the patio and it was nice.   That's all I can think of to say about this place.  I'm looking forward to trying it again soon and hoping to see it get better and busier every time.

I stopped here for lunch a few weeks ago on a Saturday.  I was waiting on my boyfriend and had been meaning to check this place out so I figured I'd stop in.  I was a little confused about where to park and which building it was at the location, but I figured it out.  I sat at the bar, got some good suggestions from the bartender and ordered my lunch. I don't remember the name of what I got, but the sandwich was amazing!  The prices are better for dine in ($10 I think), but I was definitely not disappointed.  The pesto, cheese, veggies and bread make my mouth water thinking about them.  I'll be coming back for sure.  One complaint I have is that it is difficult to find parking around there.  I noticed that there were a lot of run-down vehicles parked on the street so I'm guessing there's a vehicle hoarder/restorer nearby.  Hopefully the run-down vehicle issue will change so that it's easier to support this awesome little spot.

I ate here on a Tuesday night while on a last minute staycation (our power was out for 24 hours due to a monsoon storm).  The best part about this place is the ambiance.  Music and lighting was really chill, would be a great place to meet a friend for dinner and/or catching up over drinks and dessert.  I sat at the bar (dined alone), ordered a taco and half order of posole.  The service was perfect.  I even had the opportunity to charge the dinner to my room which was very convenient.  The taco was really tasty and I'd come back for that, but the posole was just ok for me.  It wasn't the best I've had in Phoenix.  The broth, hominy, side ingredients were good but the pork was kind of terrible. It was cubes of hard pork. I'd rather have no pork than weird cubed pork. I'm thinking maybe they throw that in last, like when you order pho?  Either way, I'll be back and maybe just pass on the posole and definitely get tacos and a beer.  Also, I ran into some friends who were having a beer at the bar.  Super fun to have a local hotel restaurant/bar that is awesome enough that the locals hang out there too.

Stopped in for some afternoon caffeine on a Friday.  The cold brewed coffee is perfectly tasty and nice and strong.  No complaints.  Service was nice and the place had lots of interesting stuff to look at if I were to hang around. It was quiet and dark, which isn't surprising for midday on a weekday at a coffee shop.  The only difficulty I had was figuring out where the parking lot entrance is. That's only because I don't normally come to this plaza, but I'm sure not a problem for other people.  It's immediately east of Kyrene on Southern, FYI.  I will be back! Can't wait to try some of the pastries next time.
