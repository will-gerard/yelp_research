I've driven past this place before and thought it looked cool...so, I wish my review was positive.  We went on a Monday night so it was busy, and I get that, but that's when you ramp up your staff...you'd think.  First there was no seating except for tables by the pool tables, so we were constantly in the way of the pool players, which is obviously not ideal. They should probably just remove those tables and put in a bar that runs the side of the wall. But I digress... We waited over an hour for two baskets of mediocre wings, and drank beer from dirty bar glasses. (Ew.) When we finally got the wings, they weren't even super hot, like they'd be sitting around for awhile, and to top it all off: they were nothing special at all. The sauce was "meh" at best, there was no celery to be found, and there were a whole whopping 6 wings for $8.50. The waitress was obviously trying to do her best on a busy night and gave us a couple of drink tickets to make up for the wait, so that saved this from being a one star review.  Sad, Harvey's. Just sad.

If you are in the neighborhood, want a strong drink, and like a good dive bar, this is the place to come. (Especially if Linda is working!) Like the jukebox selections, you never know what you're going to find at the Dill. However, it is always a good vibe here and you'll always have a great time.  The regulars are all cool, and the staff is awesome, too.

Not impressed...the inventory is old and outdated. Most of it looks cheap...not a plus for anyone trying to sell their pieces. I also do not like how they make you put your purse in a locker...I get that not everyone is as trustworthy as I am, but it turns me off.

Bead World is the best bead store I've found in Phoenix. First of all, they have a really great inventory, with new pieces, that actually help me keep up with "trends" versus going to say, Beads Galore, where everything seems about 10 years old.  Second, their prices are pretty decent. Sign up on their website and you'll get coupons for 40% off emailed to you. Last, the staff nice and helpful. I like how they trust you and don't ask you to put your purse in a locker.

Sweets & Beats is amazing! Plenty of cool/weird/unusual stuff to look at, besides the records...I find something I want everytime I go. This is unlike any other store you'll find in AZ. The candy that foams in your mouth is awesome....I highly recommend.

Oh Rips. It's one of those bars where you feel like you can go by yourself, but not feel awkward, harassed or snubbed, as well as actually have a good time. Pauly is a great bartender and he'll treat you right, and the rest of the staff is friendly too. Thumbs up!

Love Port of Subs and so happy that we have one in Phoenix proper! Their bread is delicious and their mayo/mustard combo is a must. They also have sliced pickles which makes the sammich.  So much better than the Quizno's that used to be here.  I will be back and hope you'll visit too, I want this to stick around!!
