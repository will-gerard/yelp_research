I pretty much knew that visiting this place was going to leave a lot to be desired.  The food here isnt/hasnt been/never will be good. You would think for a place that advertises wings that they would be better but nope, they suck. Knowing this, this time I ordered the buffalo chicken sammich and my friend ordered some cheese sticks. Now the sandwich only comes with beans or coleslaw, to add French fries is extra. So I scrapped the beans/slaw and got the fries. I'll address the cheese sticks first. My friend got the puniest, most pitiful looking cheese sticks I've ever seen. She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun. So I enjoyed the sammich, but pretty much hated everything else.   customer service was good, hence the two stars. If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have gotten any. The beer was good and cold...like it was posed to be. The place was LOUD too...which actually worked in my favor and helped to distract my kid. Other than that, I don't really have many good things to say about this place. Umm...it was clean. Yup. That's it.

Went to octane on a Friday afternoon. Its a spacious place, with lots of party rooms and pool tables. They even have a bar that you can get alcoholic drinks at, but the max is two (and for good reason). There are 2 racing tracks for you to get your racing fix. These carts get some good speed going! I drove 2 different karts, and the first ones handling was superior to the second. In the second one the grip was significantly less, which made for some frustrating tail happy racing. Prices could be better, but I still had fun and will most likely go back.

Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride. As an Irish bar, there is a lot of whiskey on the wall, but they can make whatever you need. The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  On the encouragement of the bouncer, I ordered the wings which were meaty but I've had better. What I should have gotten was the shepards pie. 2 of my friends got it, and it was VERY good. I'm going to go back, just get it on my own.  Lastly, this place dishes out cheap, strong drinks. Good place to get sauced before hitting a club.

Sweet sweet pizzeria Bianco. This is by far one of the best restaurants in phoenix, and my favorite. The atmosphere is definitely what makes this place so great, and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. I recommend the margherita pizza with procuitto added, the arugula that's placed on top gives the pizza a great contrast/different taste thats excellent. We also had another pizza (the last one listed in the pizza section on the menu) that was equally as good.   The only reason i gave the review 4 stars is because of the wait. Everytime I've been here there has been at least a 2hr wait. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, so you have to show, get your name on the list, and wait. Bar Bianco (an old house right next door that's been converted into a bar) definitely makes this wait go by faster, and has an equally great atmosphere as well. You can order some small appetizers there, choose something from the beer and wine list (try the dos cabezas if you like reds) and they will come and get you when your table is ready. The food is definitely worth the wait tho, I have never been disappointed and will definitely be back.

Came in here on a Sunday night trying to kill a little time. The 4 of us sat at the bar, and little did we know but we were in for a show. Jake is hands down the best bartender in phoenix. We sat and watched in amazement as he created his masterpieces with care. None of us had anything specific in mind, so all we had to tell him was the kind of liquor we like, he would make a recommendation, and then make it. I'm a whiskey drinker, so he made an excellent (insert name here-because there is no name for it yet) drink, that was definitely what I was looking for. highly recommend coming down here and asking for him!

Came here on a sat afternoon and there was a decent line, so we sat in the bar area. Took a bit for the server to come over, but he was friendly. Ordered the food and that took awhile to come out also. I got the nachos and was very underwhelmed by them. A friend got the pastalaya and wasn't happy with it either. Pretty sure I won't be coming back here for a long while. And I forgot to mention the prices. Ouch.

In the heart of downtown lies a quaint little place called Cibo. I visited this place on a Friday during lunchtime and sat outside because the weather was beautiful. Nestled in an old house off of 5th ave, this place has a lot of character. Wrought iron tables and chairs on a brick patio surrounded by green shrubs and birds a chirpin, it's got a relaxed type of vibe. Our server was cool, and did a good job of being attentive and getting out food out to us. We ordered the PLT and Salsiccia both with side house salads. The food came out a little under 10 min after we ordered! We were very impressed by that. The portion sizes were great, and I almost couldn't finish all of mine. I had always heard good things about this place and was not disappointed. Will def be back to try the pizza and wine.

Big. Big might be a bit of an understatement when describing this place. The portions are HUGE. I ordered the 3 egg omelette with salami, which also came with hash browns and toast. The 3 eggs was more like 4. Half the plate was eggs/salami, the other half was hash browns. Then she brought the toast out, with a homemade jam. Then I had the nerve to order a side of bacon.  *sidenote* the bacon was 3 thick strips sprinkled in pepper. When I bit into that first piece, the amalgamation of pepper, maple and succulent pig meat did a slow sensual tango with my tongue. I immediately looked around to see if anyone else was having this same experience. Yes. I was not the only one. Bacon. Get it. *end sidenote* There was so much food I had to map out a quick strategy. Started with the bacon. (BACON. GET IT) then dove into the eggs which was very good. The hash browns were on point, and the jam was very good.   The only reason I didn't give me a 5 is because of the wait. This is a popular spot, so be prepared to wait about 45 min. The place isn't that big, so we waited out front for just about 45. The wait was def worth it.

Hidden gem in surprise! Nice atmosphere, its a Italian eatery. I ordered the chicken limone and it was excellent! The menu gives you a great selection of sandwiches, pizzas and pasta dishes. Def recommend giving this place a visit. Wait staff was prompt and enthusiastic.

I've driven past this place a million times and always wanted to check it out, so me and a friend of mine did. This place is way bigger than it looks from the outside. Its a nice and trendy place, with art for purchase along the walls. The server/sandwichmaker/barista was not only cute, but friendly. The menu here is more than adequate, with a few tantalizing items. I ordered the pizza (10in) hob nob pesto with sausage and my boy had the docs choice sandwich. The food came out in approx 10 min, and she brought it to us. The pizza was FANTASTIC. Definitely wasn't expecting it to be that good. I also ordered a black and white iced mocha, and it was served in a huge cup (Starbucks aficionados think venti+a little bit more) and it was awesome as well. Prices are reasonable (13.50) for mine. Apparently they have live music here on certaindays, and they have an expansive beer selection. I will definitely be coming back here.

With the closing of b dubbs that was right next door, marjeles has the wing game locked down. I highly recommend the gorilla wings, they are very big and meaty (haha, no homo). Great customer service and good prices, great place to go.

I'm giving this review 5 stars purely on tue customer service alone.   We slid into this joint on a sat evening around 8pm. There was a good crowd going, but not packed. We were allowed to pick our own seat, and our waiter greeted us promptly. I ordered a Mai tai ( the drink is strong, and I recommend it). The drinks came out quickly, and we put in an order of pot stickers. I can't say I enjoyed them too much, they were crunchy, like deep fried instead of the traditional pan fried. We then ordered the entrees. I had the spicy thai chicken bowl, and she had the pork tacos. The Thai bowl wasn't spicy, but it was HUGE and good. The pork tacos though...were much better than what I had. It made me wish I had ordered those instead. Lastly we ordered chocolate macadamia nut brownie that was delivered hot, with a side of vanilla ice cream with nuts in it. The brownies were very rich, and the ice cream complimented it very well.   The highlight for me was our server. He was very prompt with the service, gave us excellent recommendations, and catered to our every need. His actions alone made the meal.

Came here on a Tuesday night. If you dont know where this place is and if your not looking for it, then you will pass it up,(its on 7th st right next to Humble Pie). It has a very cozy vibe to it, and the patio had a good amount of people on it enjoying this wonderful weather. The service was good. Our waitress Elaina let us know which beers they were out of. And when they didn't have the one I wanted, she was quick to suggest an alternative which was just as good.   We ordered the Calvano, and the Jive Turkey. The Calvano was good, it was almost like eating a pizza (just as Elaina told me). It had sopressata, artichoke chunks, local tomatoes, red peppers and a good cheese to compliment, on chibatta bread. I didn't try the Jive Turkey since I'm not a fan of cream cheese (it was either that or cottage cheese, hell I don't remember) but she said it was a good sandwich. Both sandwiches were accompanied by a side salad that came with dressing on it (don't know if you have an option to choose something different) which I thought was a great choice.   The best part about this place for me was the music. I've never been to a place like this that plays hip hop! Adi don't mean that cookie cutter bullshit that's on the radio. I'm talking about Beastie Boys, Pete Rock and CL Smooth, DTMD, T-Love (bonus props for them playing this, I've never heard her music played anywhere but in my CD player)  some serious underground (read: REAL) hip hop. I had heard a couple of Pete and CL tracks while I was there, but it didn't occur to me that the restaurant was playing tracks off of Pete and CLs second CD entitled.....The Main Ingredient.  Well played guys, well played.   So for 3 beers, and 2 sandwiches, total came to 34.98. Not bad at all. I'll definitely be back, and I'm bringing friends with me.

Talking stick is a great hotel/casino! Check in isn't until 4pm, but if you call reservations early they can and will try to accommodate you. The staff is very friendly and this place is VERY nice. The actual casino is a bit small, and was very crowded on a sat night. I was surprised that they only had 1 blackjack table that had a min of 5 per hand.  Everything else was 10 and up. The room I had was definitely worth the 180 total I paid for it (club level) and it had a amazing view.   During the summer they host pool parties on sat and sun. I went on sat and had fun, there was a mixed crowd of young and older people there. Its a 21and up type of function and they dont charge to get in, nor do you have to be a guest of the hotel to attend  (like some other places that host pool parties). afterward we went to eat at the blue coyote cafe (the buffet place was just short of 30 per person). While the food was good, we had somewhat of a rude hostess that not only myself but a few other patrons did not appreciate. This is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.   went to degree 270, which is a club that's on the 14th floor of the hotel. Its good to see places that still adhere to a dress code of no t shirts, it made the place classy.   All in all I was very impressed with this place. Their rates and prices were very reasonable (a bottle of jack Daniels sent to your room for only 45 bucks?!) the staff friendly and helpful, and an overall beautiful place to be.

I had heard about this place but never actually went until tonight. It's a really cool place to hang out, and they play movies there. The bar had a decent selection of beer and wine, and I think they were handing out free bags of popcorn. There was a dj spinning music which was cool, but it was really loud so you basically have to shout to hear anyone. Still a hip place, I'll def be back.

This place has always been super busy the few times i have been there. When you make an appointment, they ask you to be there 30 min prior to your appointment. You get there, fill out a sheet with some info...and wait. Then you get taken back to a room to be seen by your doctor/specialist...then wait some more.   i had an appointment today at 830. got there at 815, filled out my sheet, then waited. got walked back to the exam room...then waited at least another 30 minutes before the doctor came in. She literally talked/asked questions for 3 minutes, then rushed me out. Was not happy.   Sadly, this has been my experience everytime i have been there. The doctor was very nice and cordial, but each time i saw her, i always had to wait much longer than i should have, and was always rushed out of there.   i understand that its a busy place, but at least act like you care about your patients.

Very underwhelmed with this place.   When my friend and I walked in on a wed evening, the place was just about empty. We sat at the bar, and something just felt off about the place. It could have been cause the presidential debate was on...I dunno. Anyhow, service could def be better. The bartender greeted us and asked for our drinks. As we were going to give the selection, another worker (possible manager) started talking to her. So we just sat there, waiting for him to finish before we could order.  She brought chips and salsa. The chips were warm, but the salsa left a lot to be desired.  The manager dude kept talking to her, so we had to wait for drinks.  Again...there really wasn't anyone in there, and we had to wait.  So finally we get to order food. I got the taco salad, he got a quesadilla. Food comes out, and we don't have silverware which she acknowledges. She went to get it, but again the manager dude starts talking, so again were waiting. 5 min later, and after asking another waiter for it, she finally delivers.  Taco salad was bland. Meat barely had any flavor, and the taco shell was somewhat stale. Prices weren't all that great either, and both meals were not worth what we paid for.   Will not be going back and I don't recommend you even waste your time here.

I love this place! I went in today after smelling the goodness while driving by. The owner is a really nice guy, and he pretty much greets everyone as they come in. If he doesn't, then whomever is working the register will. I ordered the beef rib dinner with beans and greens. I got it to go, and it had my car smelling so good!  But, driving with barbecue sauce all over your face hasn't been the in thing to do since 92, so I waited. The rib portions are huge! The greens were excellent, I didn't even need to hot sauce them up. The beans were wonderful as well. It was hard for me to stop eating any of it.   So if your looking for a place to get some good BBQ, I highly recommend this place !!

Its a cool place to go, especially due to its location. Not much else going on in surprise, so this place will thrive.   The place is spacious, with lots of bars, and places to sit. The arcade section is kind of small...btu hey, there's an arcade section! You can also play laser tag...pretty cool. They have a lounge section which is nice, but when we sat down at the couch section, no one came to take our order. It was the same in the adult lounge/bowling alley. Plenty of places to sit, plenty of employees walking around yet no one to take a drink order. To bowl in the adult section is pricey...i think it was approx 30 bucks.   All in all, a nice place to go if you live in suprise.

Love this place! The ambiance is very chill and laid back here. The best part about it is the fantastic view of downtown Phoenix. This place is definitely helping out the downtown scene. Sometimes they have people perform, and sometimes a dj spins chill music (little bit of lounge, old school). The wait staff is friendly and helpful, did not take long at all to get drinks. As the weather starts to cool off more, this place is going to be packed.  I didn't appreciate the short male bartender that stood there and continued to look at everyone and everything else but me as I was waiting to order a drink. Other than that, I really dig this place. While the crowd is a mixed set, I've noticed most of the patrons are a little bit of an older crowd. Regardless, I'll def be back.

Came here on a sat night at 1125 and there was still a good crowd, not packed/crowded. We were greeted by a very nice lady who informed us that there was only 5 min until last call, but if we decided to stay then we would get served immediately. And we did! Our server was prompt, friendly, and knowledgable about all the different beers they had. The beer that is on tap changes everyday, giving a great variety to choose from. Great ambiance, excellent customer service, I highly recommend checking it out.
