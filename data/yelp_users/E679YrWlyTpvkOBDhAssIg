When I lived in Chicago, I felt like I was starved for good Chinese food in my neighborhood. I was close to Chinatown, but could never get organized enough to be the crowds.  But in Phoenix, I have Flamingo Palace. AND they deliver. What is it with delivery in Phoenix? When I'm lazy, I want food at my door. And I'd like to have more than pizza as an option. Anyway. I love their beef skewers and their moo shu pork. Their beef and broccoli is also yummy. I've tried lots of other things, but these are my favorite. And I think their chicken fried rice can cure the common cold.

We eat here pretty regularly. I'm a fan of moo-shu pork, chicken fried rice, teriyaki beef skewers, teriyaki beef, and crab puffs. I generally don't like their lemon chicken or egg drop soup. It's not bad tasting, I just have my favorites. Delivery can be slow, but pick up is super fast. Also, the restaurant is pretty charming in that classic American-Chinese restaurant way :)

We recently had to put our cat down. Deer Creek is our regular vet, but this experience made me want to right a review. Our cat got sick suddenly and the news wasn't good. We would have to put her down within hours of bringing her in. The staff was amazing. They sat with her and held her while we dropped our little one off at school and I drove home from work. They made her last momments loving. They hugged us all and we just received a condolence card in the mail.  As long as I'm in PHX, this is where I'm bringing my pets. THey also amazingly got my ratty calico cat (who's been kicked out of other vets) shaved and my dog goes there happily for doggie day care. Loosing a pet isn't easy, and these people know it and care about you.

It's good cheap drinks with a laid back crowd. Full of regulars. It's nothing fancy but we live close enough to walk. It's a great place to drink it up out of the house for cheap.

I went for my birthday last night. We called ahead for reservations and the hubs told them about the birthday. We showed up to a card signed by everyone, a lot of happy birthdays, no singing (thank God!), and a comped dessert (and not a scoop of ice cream, but something off the menu). I felt very taken care of. I got the whole lobster. Yummy! The keg is a nice moderately priced steakhouse that knows how to do service like a big fancy steakhouse. I'll be doing more birthdays there!!

I adore this place. I've been here several times. Here are my tips. The margaritas are pretty good. They are just mix, but they are cheap. XX Amber is on tap, which is great. As far as eats, I love: the beef tacos, enchiladas of any kind (their sauce is great), and the pollo fundido. BUT! My two go to dishes are the the beef machacha (sp?) with eggs and red chili beef tamales. Both are amazing. The tamales are heaven. Creamy in texture, beef falling apart, and super moist. I like them with enchilada sauce too. They don't need it, but it is YUMMY. Lastly, it's a kitchy gringo place but still fun. A great spot in Sunnyslope.

This is really a great place. It's got any whiskey you may want. Cigars at the ready. Fans are on high and if weather permits, windows will be open too. This is to say that non-smokers can enjoy the place easily, especially if they like whiskey or scotch. My husband and I found our favorite cigars easily and the bartenders were able to make some great whiskey recommendations for new things to try. We will undoubtedly be back.

We just got a ton of take out here. Gyros, potato ckaes, baklava, hommos, flat bread, and kabobs. Everything was great. I loved the potato cakes which were a little spicy which made them great. The takeout containers were straining with the amount of food! Seriously generous portions. Their cucumber yogurt sauce is super thick and doesn't drip out of your gyro. We have leftovers for days and we'll be going back soon.

I come here in the afternoon when there is not a crowd. A good friend lives close by and she loves the fried pickles (which are quite yummy), so it's our meeting place of choice. They have my favorite cheap Irish whiskey, tullemore dew. We can always get a booth. The wait staff is attentive. I'll come back!

This is my go to sushi restaurant. I love the hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) that is grilled. They don't have it all the time, but get it when you can. Everything is good here. Nigiri, sashimi, rolls, it's great. They do all their own butchering. And if you have non-sushi eating companions, there are plenty of noodle, soup and such dishes that are wonderful. You can take everyone there. It's BYOB, so grab your favorite sake or beer and head in! I've never had bad service there either. Always great.

I love their lunch buffet. Reminds me of the indian buffets I would go to in Chicago. Their chicken tikka is great, as is their saag paneer. I love that they have mango lassis as part of the buffet. They have some yummy vegetarian dishes too!

I come to Hanny's to drink not to eat. Not that I don't eat there, but not much beats a $5 classic gin martini in the afternoon. If you go early, it's a office crowd. Mellow, comfy, cheap, it's great. Just watch out, for $5 it's easy to order more than you need :)

This place is crazy. It's not my style, but man it's a sh*t show on the weekend, which makes it fun.   A group of us (4) went their for their chocolate martinis as a dessert after dinner elsewhere. It was really busy. It took us a while to find a table. It took longer to get some service. But, when we did, the martinis were great.   In the meantime, we watched the crowd. It's a bar scene for all ages, 20s - 70s were here, but I'd say it was dominated by an older (50s? 60s?) single crowd. And there were some crazy acts of desperation there on a Saturday night. Several people making out with each other. One dude was trying to swallow this lady with the way he was kissing her.  There was a live band covering all sorts of things from DNCE to Blurred Lines, to some older 80s and 90s stuff. People were shaking their asses and throwing their hands in the air. The younger women were dressed like they were older women. The older women were dressed like they were younger. The dudes were dressed like Tommy Bahama.   Ultimately, it was straight out of Orange County, CA, were I grew up. It was, to say the least, very entertaining :)

I like Gallo Blanco. Their drinks are good and so it their food. But today, I had a horrid experience that will keep me from coming back. My friend ordered a salad and bit into glass. A lot of glass. Not a trifling amount of glass.  I'd say a few pieces the size of peas. The staff took care of it, and comped our meal. But, I won't go back. While our server was great today, they haven't been fantastic on other times. Glass and so so serve will keep me from going again.

Did you see my picture of the mozz salad? THEY MADE A BOWL OUT OF PROSCIUTTO. Life cannot get better. I've been here 4-5 times. I always love it. I love their basil gimlet. And now, I love this salad. Such a guilty pleasure.

The food is a bit better than Dennys and the pie selection is nice. They are always cool with my kiddo; he's delayed and sometimes can be a bit much to handle. But the inside is nice, seems newly decorated. I've been about five times and will surely go back. The chocolate silk pie is really really yummy.

Good coffee, great cold brew. I love walking down there from the ASU downtown campus. It's a nice break, and few students frequent it. The only thing I don't like about it is the seating. It's not super comfy and not conducive to conversations. That said, I'm mostly a grab and go kinda person with coffee.

I got a large Americano to go from this place. Price is about right, coffee was good. Better than Bucks, but to me, everything there is burnt.   I didn't order food, but many things looked good and the pastries looked great. The service was good, a bit slow. But you know, they used espresso machines where you didn't just push buttons and stuff came out. So, that happens.   My only complaint was that inside the cafe it was hot. I'm sure the air hadn't kicked in yet.   I'll head back.

This is a great place for food and a fun place to people watch. With a party of four, we got the seafood tower (oysters, enormous shrimp, lump crab meat, a lobster) for the table. So amazing. I loved everything (look it's a seafood tower, of course I loved it!). Then for dinner to try to order a somewhat responsible dinner, I ordered the steamed chilean sea bass in a soy-ponzo sauce over wilted spinach. I though, man this doesn't sound as good as the lemon Parmesan sole, but I'm being good. Holy cow, it was the BEST cooked fish I've ever had. EVER. I'm craving it now. The fish melted in my mouth and the sauce was so good, I asked for a spoon. Service was perfect.   As for people watching it's a little bit of a hot spot for a somewhat older crowd (50s?). I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than the rest of my party and I didn't even try the bar since there was a lot of men standing next to their seated dates. There was a live band, everyone seemed to be having a great time, a little whooping and hollering. A couple of *DRUNK* ladies exited while I was waiting by the door complaining about not getting any attention from the men here. So funny. Perhaps it's couples hot spot? None the less, its a fun joint.   Exited to go back and order that fish again!

I can't write a fair review for this place because I was so frustrated trying to get a table that I walked out.   I was there at about 8pm on a weekday night. It was not crowd. No one was sat in the restaurant. A few tables were outside on the patio. We had a group of about 8. We wanted to sit outside, but the tables weren't arranged as such. The staff gave us so much sh*t for wanting to seat a group. We were made to wait. We said, we'll move it, no problem, no we were stopped. It was like we were completing imposing on the "style" of the place. When there is nothing going on and no one is there, would you turn down a party table who all want to drink? No, it's tips galore.   After 15 minutes of waiting, being scowled out, approached, sighed out, told to wait again, we walked.   I will not go back.

I just had lunch here and the menu has changed a great deal. The food has certainly gotten better. I had avocado toast with burrata covered in grapes and grape tomatoes. UNBELIEVABLE. It's an appetizer, but I feel full but not gross. So yummy and creamy. Give it a try. Their barrel aged manhattans are excellent.

Most unreal peanut butter ice cream. Had it in a sugar cone. No extras. Just all peanut butter creaminess. It wasn't too sweet either; I'm pretty sure it was made with really high quality natural peanut butter. Jonesing for my next visit. Other types of ice cream is good too, but man, I'm here for the PB.

I've had my son's birthday party there and it was great. But today was a complete disappointment. Hours are posted that they open at 10am for open play. I show up at just after 10, their doors are locked. So I wait for 20 minutes in Barnes and Nobles. At 10:20, their doors are unlocked. We go inside only to be ushered out because it's booked for a birthday party. Nothing is posted on the door. Nothing is on their website. I just wouldn't have come rather than deal with a screaming child. Ultimately, if you go to the place, either do it for a birthday party or check, double check triple check when their open play hours start.

I went for breakfast with my husband on a weekday. The I ordered an egg and cheese omelet. He got some pancakes and eggs. Coffee was fine. When my omelet arrived, it was not really an omelet as I expected, but more like eggs that were scrambled, thrown on the flat top, then rolled up with some american cheese inside. There was a huge, long hair on my plate. When I told the waitress, she acted like I was inconveniencing her. She didn't say sorry or let me get you a new one, she just grabbed my plate and left. Soon she dropped another omelet on my table. The food wasn't great. It just wasn't worth it. Bad service and not so good food. Denny's and IHOP are better than this place.

I like their lunch buffet. I'm not a vegetarian but I'm a big fan of veggie Indian food. It's a great selection. They don't just bring out the typical naan you'd see at a buffet, but something lighter, bigger, it looked like a cone. It was super tasty.

Popped by for lunch before I had to do some work. Our server came over with waters nearly immediately. I ordered a fantastic cranberry cider. She recommended the pesto grilled cheese sandwich with spam. Yes, spam. IT WAS GREAT. I mean, I could eat that sandwich for lunch everyday. And it's a few blocks from work, so I might!

Really yummy food, but like the name a bit salty. I had the bacon and eggs: creamy grits with pork belly and an egg. Really good, but it was salty. And I like salt, a lot of salt. But the salt was coming from the grits, not the pork belly.   Wine was good, Brussels sprouts were good, dessert was great. Service was also great: Nate was super attentive.   I'll go back, I'll just get something different. My hubs meal of the fried chicken thighs way also tasty.

I'm not a huge fan of their rolls (a little overly creative without great taste behind it), but every time I go for lunch I get the sushi or sashimi lunch platter. You know, the basics. And they are AMAZING. The sashimi is so lovely. It's big slices of fish that are some of the most delicious sashimi I've had in PHX. I typically don't like salmon and I gobble this up. The sashimi lunch is $15 and I'd say its 4 slices of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. Worth every penny.

This is within walking distance of my work. I love to eat and drink here. I love that I can get breakfast here for lunch. I love that they sell cartel coffee so I can get a good coffee quickly without going to Starbucks. I love that when I want to spoil someone, I can run by and grab a dozen macaroons to bring home. The place is nice, always smells amazing. I love the rice bowl, the bacon, the chicken curry sandwich. Burgers are great and my husband would eat their fries every day of the week. Sometimes they can be a touch slow, but that's a small complaint.

The food at America's Tacos is always great. But this location just sucks. Went at 45 minutes  to closing. No beans. "We didn't make any because we are closing soon."  Ok. Just say we sold out. How about an ice tea? "We are closing soon so we don't have ice tea either." REALLY? The beans are why we go to America's. They didn't have horchata or jamica (sp?) either. I understand being ready for close but people were still coming into the store. The manager needs to sort this out.

I just popped by for grab and go sushi for the first time.   I think I discovered the cheapest, fastest, biggest, yummiest lunch in downtown Phoenix.  I grabbed the California roll sampler (3 plain, 6 spicy, 6 crunchy). You wanna start with the go-to stuff when trying something out for the first time. It was 7 dollars! And there are 15 pieces! Man was it good too. A little eel sauce on the crunchy was great. Spicy had heat and flavor. Plain was a good staple.   I plan on going back many times. Next I want the orange roll (california with masago on top) or their sushi lunch special. I don't recall prices over $10 in the grab and go case. It's really a yummy lunch if you just want to head back and eat at your desk.  Great job Harumi,  you made a regular out of me.

I went here because the reviews were good and it was close to home. What a find! I had a great gel manicure from Nina. She was so careful and precise. My nails look amazing. I got a fun mint green color Nina suggested now that spring is coming. Everyone here speaks great English and Nina was fun to talk to. Not only that, it's very clean, people are friendly and they already have regulars after being open for only 4 months. I'm coming back. This is my nail place now.   Oh, did I mention the manicure was $25? Great pricing. Best manicure I've had.

I really like this place. I normally go to a buffet for Indian food and have some favorites, but they were closed this past memorial day. We opted to go here. I was very happy with the chicken tikka masala and the saag paneer. Nothing was left. We also ordered samosas, which were on the spicy side, but great. The only thing to complain about is the price. It's a touch expensive to me. But that said, there are few Indian restaurants in the valley and even fewer that are good. Try this one out!

I enjoyed the doughnuts here. I got the coffee cake donut and bought the maple bacon for a friend. They were INTENSE! A little too much for me, but that doesn't mean I would not, say, try another donut to see if it suits me better. I mean, you have to find the right one! The coffee was also good. Not bitter like some other establishments.

It's a great place for kids if you didn't get up at the crack of dawn to avoid a wait. They have Foosball, ring toss, and ping pong outside. My kid literally didn't care that we waited about 20 minutes. The service was a little slow on the inside, but ok. They put some chives on their bacon. Fine for adults, but my kiddo flipped. Picking chives off bacon sucked. And it's so unusual to have bacon topped with anything I didn't even mention it. That said, I'd totally go again.

I eat at Tom Yum at least once a week. I do it because of the food. Sure, their service can be bad and slow. It's normally when they are very crowded or understaffed. It's rare to come in here at 12noon and get a table. Most of the time, the seats are filled. Really, the slow service does not bother me. They are always nice, I've never seen them be rude. They may take your order fast and move on in, but that's during the lunch rush.   Anyway, back to the food. Their soup they give you as a starter (it's free) is delicious. I always gobble it up. I love the following: Tom Yum soup, broccoli noodle, pad thai, yellow curry, massaman curry, thai fried rice, and sweet potato appetizer. The broccoli and eggplant dishes are also great for lunch!

Fractured Prune donuts is inside The Corner. It's an interesting set up, where donuts are freshly fried then made to order. I have to admit that walking back to the office with a box of *hot* donuts was really appealing. And they do taste quiet good! I find them to be a little greasy, though. Also it's $1.95 a donut or 15.95 a dozen. A wee bit expensive too. Their iced coffee was good too. Another bonus is that their allergin list was easy to see (I found it by the coffee supplies) and it looks like there are plenty of items that are peanut and nut free. They even list dye numbers for people with sensitivity. My little one is peanut allergic and a donut shop is not something I've risked with him. Its possible he can try these!!! In sum, I'll totally go back.

First they ditched the neon sign. It's a bit hard to find now. But once you to find it the first thing you experience is the smell of delicious garlic bread coming from up the stairs. My mouth was watering before I head down. The drinks were amazing, the waitress was super nice. The flatbreads were tasty and smelt unbelievable. I could see myself spending a lot of time here.

I typically eat at their downtown restaurant for lunch, but this location opened near home and I had to grab some take out tonight and gave it a try.   This place is great. The food is great and prepared better than the downtown location. The downtown place is so busy when I'm there. This place is nice quiet. The wait staff can attend to you. It's very nice and mellow.    I got the pad see we (broccoli noodles) and the hubs got yellow curry. Both were amazing. I'm fighting myself to save the leftover noodles for breakfast. I don't know if they'll make it! The Thai ice tea wasn't even super sweet, which is a nice change. Plenty sweet but didn't make your teeth hurt!  If you want to try, I suggest the broccoli noodles, pad thai, any of the curries, and the spicy eggplant. The fried rice is also great. The sweet potato ap will have you fighting your companions over. So good!

I really enjoyed my meal there. I got the forbidden rice bowl and their homemade kombucha. Both are delicious. The rice bowl was sweet, spicy, and tangy. I loved the snap peas in it. I ordered it with some grilled tofu. It was delicious. It's a little pricey ($13 with tofu; more expensive for other meats). Why it's not 5 stars for me is the chaos. It's crazy in there at lunch! Fighting for seat, lines for the bathroom, noisy, and lines that could've stretched out door but instead went into the dining area because of the heat (it was a 118 day). Perhaps try it off hours? I plan on eating there again, and soon.

Just went for lunch. I ordered the MISO TOGARASHI ramen ("Our homemade spicy miso, Tokyo style noodle drenched in a 50/50 pork chicken broth & topped with 2 slices of slow cooked pork belly chashu and spicy Asian slaw...topped with half an egg and garlic chips")  and the TOFU SALAD. I liked both quite a bit. The tofu salad was good, but small. I probably won't order it again. The ramen, on the other hand, is going to be a staple. The pork was amazing, so was the egg. I slurped up everything! I went at 11:30. No wait. Walked in and ordered. Food came out fast. I spent $14, but I ordered the salad. I'm looking forward to more satisfying yummy lunches from this place that will be under $10!
