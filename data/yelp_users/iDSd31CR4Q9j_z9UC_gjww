I don't usually write reviews of places at all, but after using Yelp to pick this place as a place to meet up prior to a Diamondbacks game based on the largely positive reviews, I had to come back and let people know not to believe the hype on here.  I am a lover of food and rarely find something that is just plain inedible, but that's what happened with every course of my meal at Coach & Willies. We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad. However, the Italian nachos were just plain disgusting. They reminded me of those cheap $1.50 Totino's pizzas that you can get in the freezer aisle at the grocery. The "chips" were mushy on the outside and hard as a brick on the inside; the toppings were clearly cheap and tasted awful. For my meal, I ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap. It was absolutely inedible. I was very hungry and was only able to force down two bites of the sandwich before calling it quits -- something that is unheard of for me.   Altogether, I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about. The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality. If you go here before a game, I'd recommend sticking to the beers and then getting a hot dog at the field.

I had to come on here to recommend that people NOT visit this place.   Pepin needs to be on Restaurant: Impossible immediately! They have it all wrong. The decor is depressing and dingy, so much so that I couldn't help but think that the kitchen in the back was disgusting. The service was pretty slow at responding to us, even though there were only 3 tables seated in the restaurant, one of which was only drinking (I now know why). Most of the servers were gathered behind the bar hanging out, while we waited for water refills and additional sauces to mask their nasty food.  My girlfriend and I ordered sangria, several appetizers, and I had the paella. The appetizers were some of the worst I've had in Phoenix. Nasty overcooked sausage, stale bread, flat cheap cheeses -- just plain gross. The sangria wasn't really all that tasty either (in my opinion), however my girlfriend liked it. The one saving grace of my meal was the paella that I ordered. It was not the best I've had in PHX, but definitely tasty and there was plenty of seafood inside for me to enjoy (I now realize just how brave I was to order seafood in this place -- it honestly scares me to think back on it).     The prices here are WAY TOO HIGH for what you get. I used a $50 gift certificate and our dinner for the two of us was still nearly $100!!   Please spare yourself the disappointment and skip out on this place. The only thing saving me from giving it 1 star is that the guitar player was excellent and music is worth a bonus star to me! The flamenco wasn't bad, especially for being this far from Spain, but it did make it quite loud in there during the show.

I have tried as many different places for BBQ as I could, looking for something that would do the trick. I was sorely disappointed for several years until FINALLY, Pork on a Fork popped up and around the corner from work, no less. This is BY FAR the best BBQ in the Valley. HANDS DOWN. Don't go anywhere else because you'll just be wasting your time and taste buds.  No matter where you live in the Valley, it is def worth the drive to come eat here. Just look out for the little flag on Deer Valley because you can easily miss it, being in the industrial park where it is. Over the past year, I tried everything on the menu and was never disappointed. Literally, everything is great! Tender meat, delicious sauces (I would bathe in the Crazy J's sauce), and awesome sides. Now that I no longer live in AZ, I miss this place dearly, so I had to come on here to show some love.   Why haven't you gotten in your car to head over already?! Seriously, go there NOW! You won't be disappointed.

I don't leave reviews very often, but after eating here today for lunch, I had to share how AMAZING this place is!! It is a bit tough to find if you don't know what you're looking for, but keep looking - I promise it won't disappoint! I had the Cha Keung (which is lemongrass stir fry) and a basil jelly drink! The stir fry was so flavorful and delicious, I thought I was making a scene as I scarfed it down. I love spicy, so I opted for the chili sauce with it,  but I ended up not even using it because it covered up the crazy flavor of the stir fry. It was like nothing I've ever had! And then the drink - it comes with tons of little basil seeds floating in it and was very refreshing! One of the most unique meals I've ever had. I just wish I had found this place before moving away from PHX! Ok stop reading and go over there already!
