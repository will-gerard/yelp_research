Always good food... and the staff is really nice. Their minestrone soup is incredible - add some chicken... as is their cobb salad... and their homemade ice cream sandwiches.  If you belly up to the coffee bar.. ask for Theresa - she's fun, knowledgeable, and pulls a mean coffee... ! =)

Great breakfast... we showed up with 12 people at 9am on Sunday... and was told 20 minutes. I for sure was betting that they wouldn't get us in under 45 minute... but they did - which really impressed me.  The food was good... tasty, hot, and the eggs were done correctly... not much more you can ask for from a breakfast place... we'll be back definitely!

This place has gone down hill since I've first been here... i can certainly understand - costs can be outrageous in a restaurant - but I miss those duck fat fries, man!

Yay... this place is really fun with good food... and the only place that I'm aware of in the area that does food like this. Worth checking out...

Been here numerous times for the Indian food fix... and the owner, Raj, has always been responsive and helpful in making suggestions. We will bring our 18 month old and they are always very accommodating and helpful with the timing of his meal and surprisingly he loves it!  For Indian food in our area.. this place is it!
