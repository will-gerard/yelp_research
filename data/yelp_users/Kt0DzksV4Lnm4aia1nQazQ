Greeting cards will always hold a special place in my heart. There is a special feeling you get when you receive a hand written card in the mail, and that is why I continue to send them. Papyrus has such a large selection of cards -- birthday, anniversary, wedding, and so much more! Plus, they also have unique stationary, journals, and gift wrap.   I would recommend Papyrus to anyone looking for quality greeting cards. And make sure to sign up for their mailing list for special offers (including buy 3 cards, get 1 free)!

I have been going to Sachi Salon & Spa for many years now for highlights. You must see Tiffany Carter if you want excellent service and beautiful highlights.   Sachi Salon & Spa is kept clean and organized. They offer water and other various beverages for guests. I would recommend Tiffany at Sachi Salon & Spa if you are looking for an excellent and professional hair stylist.

My boyfriend and I stopped by Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to find a sweet evening treat. The staff member was helpful, and suggested the candy apples or the truffles. We tried the truffles: Birthday Cake, Mint Chocolate, Raspberry, and Milk Chocolate.   The chocolate was creamy and full of flavor. There are many other treats we would like to try, and we will definitely be back!  If you are looking for a sweat treat, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory is a great place to go!

Decided to go here for dinner with my boyfriend because of good Yelp reviews, and because the Southwest Airlines Dining program offers miles for eating here. Unfortunately, the food just didn't measure up.  Let me first start by saying that I like southwestern food. My family lives in New Mexico, so I know what New Mexican food is supposed to taste like.  To start, we ordered drinks. Then I checked-in on Yelp, and got the free chips and salsa. All of which was fine.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas. I got the enchiladas. I attempted to eat the enchiladas, but as you can see from the video I posted, the enchiladas were more like a soggy cheese crisp that a child would cook in a microwave.   The enchiladas were not even rolled. The blue corn tortillas were flat and soggy, but the outside of the tortilla seemed slightly burnt. Then the cheese grease made it completely unpalatable.   So I didn't eat the "enchiladas" and just ate the beans and rice which filled me up anyway. So when the waitress finally came back over and asked how everything was, I told her that I was not happy with the enchiladas, and I explained what I explained above. She asked if I wanted something else, I said no since I was full and didn't want to wait for something else. So she said I'm sorry "it wasn't what you expected" and walked away.  Some time later, a random guy comes up to our table and asks us how everything is, I say fine and he moved on to asking the other tables around us how their food was. My boyfriend pointed out that he was probably the manager, and that I should say something. I turned around to see if we could grab his attention, but he was already gone.  A while later, the waitress comes back over and asks if we need anything. I ask for the check. She goes and gets the check and puts it on the table. I put my card in, she brings back the check and says I'm sorry the food wasn't what you expected, but I hope you give us another chance in the future. And I said that unfortunately we would not be back based on the quality of the food.  On our way out, the guy that had stopped by our table (whom we assume is the manager), was standing at the host stand. I went up and said that I wanted to share our feedback because I don't think the waitress fully understood. I proceeded to explain what I wrote above about the enchiladas basically being a microwaved cheese quesadilla. The guy then proceeds to say that he was sorry that the food didn't taste like what I expected, and that they are a New Mexican restaurant which is not like Mexican food.   So I said, I completely understand that. In fact my family is from New Mexico, so I know southwestern food very well. And that the problem with the meal wasn't that I expected authentic Mexican food, and instead was given New Mexican food...the problem was that the food was poorly made.   He then proceeded to tell me that I should have mentioned something at the table when he stopped by. I told him that I didn't know he was the manager (as he was no more dressed up than the other employee or customer). I walked out after that, because clearly there was nothing that I could have said to get him to understand.   I would not recommend the Carlsbad Tavern restaurant.

My sister and I attended all three nights of the 2015 Phoenix Fashion Week at Talking Stick Resort. Phoenix Fashion Week is always an exciting experience, and I would recommend that anyone interested in fashion, and specifically some local fashion, attend a Phoenix Fashion Week event.

Jersey Mike's Subs is one of my favorite sandwich shops. I usually go to a location in South Scottsdale (Hayden & Thomas), but I stopped by this location after work on my way home.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in the service at this location. I waited behind another guest, whose sandwich was being made. I was kind of put off when I heard one employee say to the other employee, "When the bread is too hard, I just throw it in the microwave for a bit to soften it up." So the employee proceeded to put the bread into the microwave, then continued making the sandwich.   That employee then made my sandwich - and I am unsure if the bread they used on my sandwich had been microwaved, however when I ate the sandwich, it was extremely hard. The bread tasted as if it had been put in a toaster oven.   I called and informed them that the bread was just way too hard to eat, and the employee on the phone did offer another sandwich if I returned to the store. I declined because I was home at that point, and I didn't feel like driving back in rush hour (plus I didn't want another hard sandwich).   In my opinion, if you have to microwave the sandwich bread in order to be able to cut through it...then that bread is probably old or cooked incorrectly. So unfortunately, I would not recommend this location for that reason.
