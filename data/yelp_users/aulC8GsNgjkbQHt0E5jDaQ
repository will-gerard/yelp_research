THE BEST WALMART IN PHOENIX!! I swear! Lots of handicapped carts.. crucial for my shopping. Clean well stocked Employees are human beings and can comprehend basic english and even seem to like their jobs! Whatever this walmart is doing they need to spread it around some cause the diffrence is VAST! I drive well out of my way to shop here because its just that much better! KUDOS!!

OMG its just around the corner so i thought it might be good cause there are cars in there all the time. Well it was better than that super quick service awesome menu and the best Pho! its on our list of fabulosities!  Can't say enough good things! Haven't tried the ice cream macaroons yet but i'm going back soon.. it was perfect for an emergency hangover relief meal!

second time back here it just gets better very fast service and free beverage with Yelp checkin.. ahh man and the smell of the spices and food are heavenly when you first come in.. still no room for the macaroons though!

food came cold. redo was awful. cook slammed plates and acted an ass. manager suddenly lost all command of the english language when informed of poor food quality. never could eat my chicken freid steak.. gravy was weak. potates were bland. mac and cheese was really shells and white sauce..really icky. my freinds hashbrowns were literally dripping with grease and they brought her two types of eggs instead of eggs and sausage.. resteraunt looks clean and nice but even the ice tasted dirty and the soda was weak as well..  they were'nt busy at all either...not a good time! go to another location and save the hassle!

Dude.. authentic Japaneese in a crappy strip mall.. it even has a tree growing inside. Its an oasis of goodness in a crazy world.. evrything i try is awesome but the bento is my fave.. the gamazio dispenser is an unprecedented discovery! even i cali i'd not seen one.. This is so awesome! I'm a habitual vistor.. its just that freaking awesome!

so overpriced. didn't have dinner... just horrible  under poured drinks..  everyone was so busy trying to look sophisticated standing around saying nothing.. just vacuous! the kicker is this  hollywood type screen with logos that your supposed to take a selfie or pose in front of.. like its the pork destination station! Look like prostitutes and old people finally got a big night out!

Meh food was awesome drinks were too! It was very pricey and i tried to be ok with that but we were seated right next to a big table of very rude people with equally rude children that thought chopsticks were drumsticks and swords. I was attemping to justify our over 50.00 tab with "its a good date for me n mine" but shit these little ignorants and the big ignorants with them ignoring them ruined it all.. perhaps if we were in a booth? regardless its champange dining in a school cafateria.. have fun with that one!

Ahh mann.. tiny but mighty! The freshest tastiest seafood ever.. I'm a big fan  Ceveiche and the shrimp (something in green sauce) are stellar..fast service and very cute little hut reminds me of those beachside places that are so good and unpretentious!

Dude! we call this the ghetto walmart.. Panhandlers.. Dumb  people work here nobody knows what the heck is going on.. they hide the handicapped carts in the back no wonder they dont ever have any! the bikes are locked down so tweakers wont steal them.. just a hot mess and youll get to know your neighbors and possibly another languge as well cause the lines are so long!! Don't go here unless youre desperate for something and only the last week of the month and speak Arabic in the parking lot so some lady crying with a folgers can with a kids picture wont do her routine.. i swear there are better war zones!
