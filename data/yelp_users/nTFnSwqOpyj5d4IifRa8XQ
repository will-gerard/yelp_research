ordered the whiskey river bbq burger... looked nothing like the picture! was pretty disappointed for i assumed that by going to red robin, id be getting a gourmet burger! however, i would have rather had a burger from in n out, even burger king! the restaurant decor was nice and gave a pulp fiction like feel when uma thurman had her $5 shake + burger. hopefully this place can step up their game if they want to stay in business longer!  tips to the cook::  my buns couldve been buttered up ans toasted, i didnt see 1 onion string on the burger as to seeing lots on the pic.

moved to az from california and ive aways been looking for a place with a legit jja jang myun (black bean paste noodles) and this is the only spot that ive come across that has it. there are many types of asian restaurants but only a few that serve this chinese-korean style and do it well... this is one of them. the tang soo yook was also on point. nomnomnom!!

so this is what its like to be treated like a king. from the moment we took our seats til the last bite of the "chocolate molten cake" (which im going to say is a definite must), we were in awe of not only the setting, atmosphere, and delicious meats/treats.   before our wonderful dining experience (or might i say carnivore adventure), i had no idea what to expect... but, between the delectible sun-dried tomatoes (or you could pronounce it,, sun dried tom-ah-toes) and the filet mignon there was an outstanding staff ready to serve.   what i recommend:::::: besides all of it..... -sundried tomatoes -potato salad -cucumbers -filet -top sirloin -pic-kanye??? -and a must.. pitcher of sangria amazing way to end an amazing night... happy 3 year babe ;)

this place deserves more stars just with the bean dip... its a spicier flavorful dip to get your tastebuds ready for whats to come. ive ordered about 5 different things from here and the food has always been good... some days better than others, but always tasty and flavorful. ive only tried the beer they brew themselves once and it tasted a bit older and not as carbonated as a crispy beer should taste so i wouldnt say their beer is the greatest, but the food speaks for itself. the menu also includes an image for each dish so it makes it a lot easier to picture what youre gnna grub.   today, i ordered the hatch green chile relleno with machaca beef and got a tortilla on the side... had good flavor, spice and overall 3/3 nom's. gnna try the red corn pork taquitos next time w/ chzy fundido sauce for sure. they also have a good ice cream egg roll type dessert. nomnomnom!!

great food and good prices.  food has been 5 stars 6/7 times that we ate there.  complimentary chip and salsa bar for dinner is a pretty cool edition too. i fell in love with the chile relleno (so delicious everytime) so i havent ventured anywhere else on the menu yet.  the girlfriend always gets their machaca taco/chz enchilada/ tostada (#1) combo which is also delicious.  both meals for under $20.  dont forget to leave a tip for the courteous staff!!

Been coming here since open late 2011 and I will never step my foot into another barber shop. The quality, the expertise, and the professionalism were a perfect match with the exceptional taper fade that I usually get.   Above and beyond.  That about sums it up in 3 words.  Along with the deep shampoo I was given with the cool, minty shampoo (because I had leftover Got2BGlued gunk in my hair) that left me feeling refreshed.  To top off the cut and the razor shave, they give a hot towel massage that left me feeling like a million bucks.    Definitely recommend this spot if you're looking for a affordable, quality cut.   Good times, good people, and fantastic service
