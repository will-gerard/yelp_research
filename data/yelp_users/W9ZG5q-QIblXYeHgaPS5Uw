Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back.

I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly.

Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.

Love this place - they were very accommodating to me, Peanut and Gramma (she goes often).  Solid wine selection and Gramma says they make a good Margarita.  We all enjoyed all of our food as well.  Great view of the Mon too.

Love this place.  I used to live within walking distance and that was a treat!  Karaoke is a great time.  The drinks are great and inexpensive and there are always great people to meet there.  I miss the pickles.  ;)

how can you not be a fan of a huge pile of whatever you ordered with fresh cut fries, tangy coleslaw, cheese, and tomato smooshed between 2 thick slices of fresh italian bread?  if you aren't, there is something seriously wrong with you.  oh, and don't forget to pair it with a yuengling and a whole bunch of the cayenne pepper sauce.  also - make sure to say 'hi' to lefty!  he'll appreciate that.

These guys are AMAZING!  The food is great and everyone there is so welcoming and hospitable.  Went twice on my last trip in and each time the staff looked as though they really enjoyed themselves.

I just got a yearly pass so obviously we are fans.  The down side is that not all the informational boxes for the animals are not all functional so that's a bummer.  Otherwise is a clean, well maintained zoo that the kids really enjoy.

This place is pretty cool!  I had no idea this hidden gem was tucked away in a strip mall!  My friends and I opted for outdoor patio seating since it was such a nice evening out.  I recommend taking that route whenever possible.  The food was great!  My friends and I opted for the sampler appetizer and a combo platter and the shrimp special for dinner.  DO NOT leave without having some sweet potato pie!  Everything tasted great!  I'd love to see some different wines on their menu - maybe a good Australian Sauv Blanc or some good white blends to pair with the spiciness of the food but the Melbec that we had was just fine.  And I was impressed that one of the OWNERS was in the trenches working with the staff!  I forgot to mention my check-in deal when the check arrived but that's totally my fault.  I told the owner in the beginning of the meal and said I'd show her again when the check came.   Don't do that.  I will definitely return - most likely with my Dad, he would like a place with such authentic Cajun food!

It's a bar.  The beer selection is great as is the happy hour menu.  We had one of everything as it was a long day at work.   It would have been awesome if the bartender would have given a crap about us or the job that she was doing.   I won't say that I'd never go back, it just isn't on my list of places that I will run to in Ahwatukee.

Love this place and better yet, so did my kid!  Great food (there is a ton of it) and even better atmosphere.  Don't count on the service being that great but they aren't the ones hired to entertain you - they just pretty much bring you your food and drinks.

Z'Tejas has great margaritas (DUH), a great wine list and great food.  The atmosphere is awesome and I have never had an issue with service whether dining in the bar or in the dining room.  They are even nice enough to customize my margarita with jalapenos when I go there.  You'd think it wouldn't be that hard for a Mexican/Margarita joint but I have a hard time getting that request fulfilled at several places around PHX.  Bottom line, this is a great place for a date, a friendly get together or even lunch!!  The food will get you in the door and the cocktails and ambiance will get you coming back.

I love going to Zipps!  I've been to several in the Scottsdale area but this one is most convenient.  You know what you are going to get - good pizza, great chicken fingers, cold domestic draft beer, sports.  If you are going to do a sports bar, keep it simple, do it right and that's what you got here.  Oh, yeah - Zipp-aritas.

Although I may not look like it at first glance, in my past life, I was a barfly so this place felt like home.  However, if you are a new citizen to the bar atmosphere, this place may just scare the sh*t out of you.  I will totally be back and I thoroughly enjoyed having Amber Bock on tap and the interesting clientele that imbibes there.  The bartenders were nice enough and seemed to be good at holding their own (they were tiny gals).    It was fun and I will go back.

So I must comment on the great service that I received from one of the Sunflower Market managers, Tony, a couple weeks ago.  I was overcharged for a couple of items.  I understand that it can happen but I didn't realize it until I was almost home and my daughter (a 2yo) needed to go potty so I couldn't just turn around.  I called and explained my situation.  The gentleman on the phone (maybe Nick?) was kind and understanding.  He said I could come see Tony the next day.  I went back and met with Tony.  The store was very busy and needed him but he was prompt, kind and courteous to me and my situation.  He was able to reverse the charges for me no problem.  Although I wasn't a regular customer before that situation, because of the great customer service, I have been back TWICE.

As a family - we love pizza, and pasta, and hoagies (and wine and beer).  Yes, these guys are capable of good food - just not consistently.  We've eaten in and out and at various SONY locations but this is one closest to our house and one we have TRIED to order for delivery quite a few times and each time we've been let down.  Tonight's order was, yet again, another let down with cold food, a long time delivery (quoted an hour max and we were wondering if we were going to get our food at the hour 15 mark), a big tab (me, hub and small child) and, well, a disengaged driver.  It is what it is... I fear we are running out of boutique-y pizza places in our area - the big chains aren't great but doggone-it they are consistently hot, timely and meet the expectation.  I love supporting local businesses but I shouldn't have to sacrifice quality for my money... right?  The positive - whatever frozen cake that gets thawed enroute - we enjoyed that.  Pizza, pasta and salad...boo.  Damn.

Don't get me wrong, we love this place for sure.  The Mac and Cheese is great and the Southwest dumpling things are A-mazing.  My husband is a fan of one of their pork dishes - we get the same thing every time.  The service is spotty for sure.  I suggest going and sitting at the bar whenever possible and DO NOT go with a large party and expect to get taken care of properly.  I was embarrassed a couple times when we have taken friends and out of town guests there after I raved up and down about it.  We just go by ourselves now but hey - at least the food makes up for the service :)

What a great neighborhood find!  My daughter and I had such a great time!  They were very accommodating for us.  I hope my hubby and I get to return for happy hour or some time at the bar.  Very nice, casual environment (and clean)!!  I hesitate to give it 5 stars because the service wasn't totally spot on... I am open to upgrade my rating upon a favorable return.  We will be back.  I will recommend.  :)

Don't expect the ambiance to win you over here.  It's a small bar with about 10-15 chairs around the bar and a hand full of tables in the bar area.  The staff is as friendly as the guests and it is just a laid-back place off the beaten path.  I enjoy seeking refuge here after attending festivals in the Civic Center in the hot weather.

For a place called "Grapevine" I'd expect the wine menu to be at least decent.  I have gone to this place several times for food, drinks AND karaoke - I enjoy the view from the upstairs patio (I highly recommend sitting there).  I must admit that service every time I dine, is slow at best.  It wasn't just me though, this last time I watched the frustration of another table with a different server.     I think the location is fantastic and the building itself is great!  I would do an overhaul on the menus (drink, wine and food) and concentrate on the quality of food being served and food presentation.  I'm sure this place isn't hurting but I know it has some real potential to be AMAZING.  As it stands, it's only ok at best.

I love going here and finding new treasures for the house.   I find really great things all the time.  I don't know what a couple of these other Yelpers are complaining about when they are speaking about this Goodwill not having any clothes and wondering "What are they doing with the clothes I donate? Send them to a less desirable location in Phoenix?"  Jump on the "interweb" and Google Goodwill and make note of the Goodwill 3 miles down the street.  Anyway, if you are looking for something unique for your home - a picture, painting, coffee table, chinaware ect on a bit of a budget - check this place out.  They do a great job filtering out a lot of the crap (a lot, not all).  Some of their used furniture leaves much to be desired sometimes and I don't think I'd choose to purchase new sofas or mattresses there even through I have considered multiple chairs there BUT they have had the answer to quite a few of my furnishing needs otherwise.  Oh!  Also a great place for holiday decor throughout the year.  And they have THE best baskets for the price.  Sign up for the coupon and get 20% off a purchase of $10 or more too.

I really like this place and really enjoyed the bartender (last name was Love or something ironic like that?).  I got to escape from my hubby and kid on a Monday afternoon and it was just perfect.  The "patrons" were amusing and the bartender attentive.  I had  great time.  I am not 100% sure if I am ready to battle the crowds on a Friday or Saturday night and pay a cover but will make sure to stop in the next time I am looking for a cheap PBR during the day.   Bottom line - check it out, it's cool.

This place is great!  My husband and I ordered the other night and were pleasantly surprised!  Great food, great pricing and quick, friendly delivery.  I will note that the gentleman on the phone was pleasant and spoke English very well - we have had some issues in the past with communication break-downs so this was totally a bonus.

Just like every eatery, it is hit or miss with the service.  However this time, what's notable is the shrinkage of the menu and the quality of service.

Very impressed with this place. We've lived across the street for almost 7 years and this is my first visit.  Off the bat: pretty busy (granted it's a Saturday but this isn't a prime location - this is a destination concept and this location is tucked right next to the Salvation Army store). I didn't realize it was quick casual (you order like a fast food place but they bring you your meal). Great beer, wine and cider selection. Couple of fresh brewed teas in addition to a reach-in cooler full of beverages.   Menu looked pretty decent! I wanted to try so many items but I know I am not a big eater so I settled on the cheese chili fries. They were so good! I paired with a cider since they aren't always available in PHX. I'm coming back for the spicy tomato pasta number next time.  I am so excited to see they have almond milk shakes! Dairy is not my friend and ice cream pretty much kills me even though it is the most amazing thing on Earth. I'm having one of those with my daughter next time. She'll be thrilled I can have some ice cream with her.  All-in-all, a great find. Looking forward to another great visit. As I write this review, the line is out the door. That's really great to see in this neighborhood.  Ps - really read the reviews. If you are having a bad experience, speak up to someone who is running the joint; chances are it's not them, it's you.

Today was our first time eating at Jim's.  We have been living in this area for 3 years and I cannot BELIEVE we have overlooked this place!  1.) For a "diner" environment, this place is so CLEAN.  In fact, I have been to other, I guess, "more refined" restaurant's that weren't this clean and well kept.  Even the bathrooms were clean.  They need some updates but I am not going to complain.  2.) The service was prompt and friendly.  Again, I have spent big money on meals only to get crappy, crappy service.  They aren't going totally out of their way here, but again, we got good, overall service.  3.) The meals served covered all the "diner" bases and what we had (breakfast and they serve it all day which means they know what they are doing) was great.  I can't wait to go back for a gyro (pronounces GIRO where I come from ;) and a dog. )  4.) The prices are great and the food is plentiful.  You aren't going to gorge yourself but you will finish just about everything on your plate and be totally satisfied.   I will be recommending this place to everyone who comes to visit me and everyone who lives around me.  I was so very happy with this visit, the money we spent and the chance we took going to a "new" place for us.    Give them a try!

I'm a fan for sure.  Went yesterday with my toddler and they treat us well - not like a zit on the nose of a supermodel - something we see more often than not.  Food is good, beers and drinks are priced well and the clientele is pretty tame - even when we sit at the bar for "date night."  I would recommend this place to anyone. The Long Island is great for $4...

Really like this place for casual hang out... You can bring your patents here if they don't mind hanging out with a couple of questionable locals... :)  Edit : USED to come here often. No more. With Fate up the street, we can go for a good beer without being extorted for money because a fight we have no intention of watching is on. Bye, Felicia.

I love this place.  I always find great deals on things I need and things I didn't know I needed until I found them at Big Lots.    I am in their frequent shoppers program and especially look forward to my 20% off rewards to make the savings even better.  Don't be surprised to find just about everything you need here...  I no longer am.    Although I live right down the street from this Big Lots and go a couple times a month, I recommend going to the one on Shea and the 101.  They have a pretty good furniture department.  This particular location is limited due to space.

Great Italian food, great price.  That's really all you need.  Wine selection is okay but they have SOMETHING that will pair well with what you are eating no doubt.  They have great specials and great happy hour.  I have even taken my kid for pizza and she loves it!  Service and staffing has always been good as well.  That's as important as the food and specials!

I used to come to this place often.  I like supporting small businesses in our neighborhood and this was certainly one of them.  I came so often that my husband bought me a gift certificate for Christmas.   I went to redeem it in February and that's when the run - around began.  I was denied the first time after my services were complete.  No problem,  I paid and was told that the former owner would be contacting for payment of the certificate.   I went back 3 times after that and was given different excuses each time.  Finally,  today, I said "So $30 has been stolen from us ?" She said "yes, sorry."  I'm supposed to continue to spend my money there?  No thanks.  By the way, I have the receipt for the gift certificate for proof of purchase.      I don't only give negative reviews (nearly all are 4-5 stars) and I enjoy supporting local businesses but I cannot support bad business decisions.    They lost years of continued business from myself and my daughter (and my out of town guests) for $30...

The one good thing about this place is it is always consistent, the bad thing is it's always a consistently not good.    The margaritas are so-so, the food is so-so and so is the service - this time we lucked out and got an adequate server.  Most of the staff are poorly dressed and unkempt.  Make sure to order your next cocktail way before your first is finished so you get it in time.    The kicker, the state of the restaurant - it is dirty, unkept and in desperate need of a face-lift or at the very least a fresh coat of paint and pressure washed.  A friend that was with us stated that it's because college kids don't care about the environment that they eat in.  Looking around I pointed out the families and said that if they appealed to the families and the corporate offices in the area, they may have a better environment for guests AND staff.  So why do I keep going back?  It's never my choice.  I only go at the request of other and don't recommend them to anyone.  Have I contacted them about poor device issues?  Yes - management has reached out to me in the past but with each visit, it is clear to me that guest feedback does not effect how they run their business.    The good news, it's America and they can run it however they choose and as long as they are in the black, they aren't going to do anything to change.  Can't argue with that logic I suppose.   I would suggest their Jimaca summer salad though - the dressing is the thing that made it great but I am going to be on the hunt for Jimaca for my salads at home.  I'll just keep going to Fuzzy's for my mexican food and entertain my friends at Cafe Boa.

This place is a killer find and I can't wait to go back again to try their new menu that they introduced yesterday.  We went on Monday and the place was jumping!  A group of friends and I sat at the bar and had good service, great wine (they have a very eclectic wine list) and the food was AMAZING!!!  Although the bar is a totally cool place to sit, the next time I want to sit on a patio, I'm heading here!  Great job!

I really like this place.  The food is really good, the wine is really well priced, the beer list is interesting enough for beer lovers or novices and the patio is great for dining with children.    I like the new location as parking is MUCH easier and one doesn't feel so claustrophobic when you dining inside the restaurant.   I have never had a bad meal here nor have I ever had crappy service.  The dough balls and cookie desert are great touches for the kiddos as well.    They are doing something right...

I wish I read the reviews before we went.  It is overpriced, mediocre food.  I got a "wrap" that was institutionalized and tasteless.  Server didn't even notice when he removed the 3/4 of the uneaten thing from me.  We weren't offered boxes for the kid's food.  The drinks were OK but not good enough to get me to go back.  Side note - I find it ironic that a place that is built for kids goes and scares the crap out of them every 20 minutes with a thunder storm.  I think my kid is scared for life.  $100 for lunch.   Jeez.

Sushi is great - service is good and each time I have dined there with my toddler, they have been great.  They have a pretty good kid's dish that my kid enjoys as well.  The wine list leaves much to be desired (wine lovers have to "settle" but it isn't horrible) but the sushi is WAY better than Ra for sure!

Never had a bad meal or a bad beer here.  Great selection of brews and the food that they make is simple and GOOD.  Great recipe for success.  Service is a little spotty but expected due to the fact that these are college students who really (speculating here and actually giving the benefit of the doubt) don't care too much about customer service - it's just a job to them.

This place is great for young, school aged children. We just had our daughter's 6th birthday party and the kids and parents had a great time. We weren't quite sure what to expect but you must remember that this is a place for children. Through the lens of a child, this place is a place where they can run around with friends, participate in games, rides, laser tag and golf. We got a little room but the kids didn't even want to come in and eat cake and pizza. We didn't even open presents there because they were more interested in playing with each other. Our party coordinator was sweet and attentive and the staff in general appeared to be happy. Some of the games are dated but you know what? The kids had a blast. That's all that really matters.

I'm a total fan of this place.   The people who work there (and at Atlas right next door) are awesome.  I love stealing away and trying some great wine with some A-mazing cheese (from Atlas) and I always meet some great people who are also enjoying this little treasure of a place.  Awesome - great job.

The produce here is consistently sub par - they often have some stuff you can't get in other chains but come on.  It is right down the street from where I live yet still I only go there in a pinch - especially beer and the occasional panic for something for dinner.  The staff has never been aloof or disrespectful to me or my daughter so I do enjoy that part.  I feel a small face-lift and better quality meats and produce would put this grocery on another level.  Oh and don't bother going there for wine... there isn't a bottle in the place.

Love this place!  The staff always seems to be polite and considerate.  Food is awesome!  I saw that someone posted "The Ugly - Closed Sunday."  I always respected CFA for not being opened on Sundays.  It's a well sought-after day off in hospitality and gives their employees a chance to relax on a special day of the week with their friends and family.  Maybe that's why the customer service is so good?  Just saying...

I like this place but as stated by some previous Yelpers, the service staff is a bit... special.  The last time we were in, our server smelled of Patchouli Oil and cigarette smoke.  Not appetizing at all.  We usually get the pizza nacho things but I am dying to try the Elvis pizza one of these times.  They always have a great selection of beer on tap - a little something for everyone.

Very impressed with the attention they give to kids menu, ect.  The food is great - I have taken company there twice now and haven't been embarrassed at all by the choice.  Not too expensive but it's not cheap (ambiance, decor) or cheesy looking.  Very nice ( but not over the top) wine list and a good selection of beers and specialty cocktails.  Patio seating is very nice as well.

Great for kids and adults.  I recommend coming during the week and not the weekend.    The peanut and I had a great time!  A lot of great exhibits and there definitely is something for everyone.  Peanut didn't care for the robot exhibit but loved the fish - we were even there while a fish was laying eggs!  Never saw anything like that before.  We went during the day, during the week and that was perfect!  The Sports exhibit didn't have too much for a 4 yo so I'd suggest saving that one for an older kiddo.

This place is awesome!  It's a grocery and it seems weird but they have done a great job at offering great beers and wines at "The Watering Hole!"  We have gone for events AND for grocery shopping (though not at the same time).  Highly recommend for great grocer selection but also a great place to catch a great pint of beer or glass of wine.

Sushi was so-so, the wine list wasn't anything to make me want to go back.  They seemed to have a lot of interesting looking cocktails but I prefer wine with my sushi.  We weren't in a rush so I can't really comment of the sense of urgency for the service staff.  He seemed to be around when we needed him so that's a plus right there. The restaurant itself was clean and in good shape.  I just wasn't impressed with the sushi and the rolls at all.

Last visit was a vast improvement... It is always based on the level of service.  It was really cool to see a bunch of military recruits there- always a plus.  The guy at the table next to us snagged their bill before we could - an indication of the caliber of people that frequent the place.  The server will make or break your experience - the food is good, the atmosphere is great for family, friends and/or a great night out however the experience is contingent on the service...  the park behind the place is a great view too.

Great place!  Took a little work to figure out getting a reso but when I did everything was smooth sailing.  They took great care of my kid ( bonus points duh) BUT we were smart enough to make my reso early to be the first turn.  Food was great, wine pairing (my choice) was great. Take advantage of the Cammeron Hughes selection - I didn't know that was available until too late but I did not feel bad about the Bella Glos selection at all.  We will be back, we will request the same table, very easy nice outing for a celebration...

$1 Oysters!!  Can't beat that!  Great beer menu, great wine menu.  The bartender was a little pretentious but I will definitely be back next time we are in town!  Great atmosphere and a great cigar bar next door!  Overall, I recommend it!

Love, love, love this place!!!  Great food - huge portions - creative cocktails - eclectic wine list - good beer selection - great service every time... if you can navigate around some of the occasional Scottsdale "Riff-raff" - you will be in good shape.  I recommend getting there early - especially for Saturday and Sunday brunch... it's a hot spot and the wait can be a bit long.  The positive?  They always put out cucumber water and coffee for those of us anxiously waiting for a table.

I'm a fan.  Love the atmosphere and ambiance.  Great for a couple beers and some live music.  I liked that it's tucked away and not inundated with tourists.  Good beer selection and great patio seating.

This place is AWESOME!!  I used to go WAY back when the property was a desolate pizza place.  I was really impressed with the decor, atmosphere, wine list, beer selection, food and most of all their acts to accommodate children!!!  What a brilliant idea!!  People with children do have money and do want to spend it at places that don't have a play-land!  We went on a Friday for Happy Hour (again I recommend) and even got to sample a new Iced Tea Vodka - Deep Eddie's (that I can't wait to have again).   The service was just attentive enough but not intrusive.  We may have been too preoccupied with conversation and kids too have a two-way conversation with our server all the time.  We made sure to take care of her though.  My Yelp friends know I look for a good wine menu and that influences my rating - they had a great selection for wine lovers and those new to wine.  They had a packed patio as they had some outdoor festivities going on which added A LOT of energy to the place!!  Super fun - take your friends, take your family, take your kids and have a great time as there seems to be something cool going on everyday!  Most places don't like to do too many specials as they think it may "confuse" the guests but doing it this way makes it exciting to go any day of the week!  I would suggest one thing... maybe more bathrooms?  Unless I am mistaken, there were only 1 set of bathrooms (like 1 toilet each men and women) on one side of the restaurant and 1 set on the other side.  I'm hoping I missed something but that won't stop me from going back and telling everyone how awesome this place is!!

I really like going to this particular location.  I am constantly surprised that the service is so good.  Each person that I encounter there seems to really enjoy what they are doing.  I am really impressed with their customer service each time.  I understand this isn't someone's ideal job that they want to do when they grow up but if you are going to be a ditch digger, be the best damn ditch digger ever.  These folks do a good job at emulating that sentiment.    Otherwise, Dunkin is Dunkin.  As a corporation, they are doing a good job at branding and introducing relevant items within their market.  As a location, they are doing a good job at following through with the product.  The coffee is good and I was happy to see Egg Bagels in this town but I am still an eternal fan of the Boston Creme.  My daughter loves just about anything you give her from there so that's a win too.

Love it!  Every time I go I get a great glass/bottle of wine (depending on how many ppl I go with), prosciutto wrapped bread stick are great as always however was blown away this time by the bruschetta with brie, pears and honey!!  Amazing!  The ONLY reason this doesn't get a 5 is because there is always room for improvement - wish HH went until 7.

Great place. Great booze, beer, and wine selections. They say they don't have uniforms but I've been here several times over the past 5 years and the clothing of the staff hasn't changed. So there's that.

I am a fan of tea - iced or hot. This visit was my introduction to loose leaf tea and I'm hooked. Marion was just great - she allowed me to shop comfortably and was able to assist when needed. I am having my blend right now and it is the best cup of tea I've ever had. I am looking forward to my Sauv tea blend as well as the events (Tea 101 and dinner pairings) that Marion was telling me about.   I have wanted to visit this place so many times before but haven't had the chance. My only regret is not doing it sooner. Fortunately, it's located right next to my favorite wine bar so I know I will be making subsequent visits soon!   It's Small Business Saturday - a great opportunity to give this small business a try.  Thanks!

My husband insists on going here for the Animal Fries... every time we go there the service is consistently sub-par.  This most recent time, beverages took forever, the server didn't know how to properly open a bottle of wine (thank goodness this one server whom I've seen bust his butt a couple times before helped us out) and I got a spotted glass that I ended up polishing myself.   She was nice enough and never ever rude or short-tempered but blonde hair and a short shirt doesn't get a great tip from me.  Prompt service does. We waited quite a long time for our check then to have the check processed and then even longer for a to-go box.  It's ok for me and my hubby but I don't take any out-of-town visitors there.  There are too many other options in that area that appreciate their guests and always are looking for ways to Wow them... in a good way.  These guys "Wow" me every time... but in a bad way.  Total time there -  nearly an hour and a half for 2 apps, a kids meal, a bottle of beer and a bottle of wine (that I ended up corking and taking with me).  PS - the cheese plate consists of deli cut cheeses and meats... not impressive either.

My kid loved this place!  The fish and animals appear to be well taken care of and the activities for the kids to participate in seem to be plentiful.  It is a surprising place to have an aquarium but you'd never know once you are inside.  We will be going again... I am considering a membership.  I am not quite sure yet though.  I'd recommend for sure!

Heart this place.  Try the Pineapple Habanero Salsa for sure - order a Pale Ale or Sauv Blac to cut it though.  Bummer is that HH ends at 6 but I will slide in whenever I can - however NEVER ordered something I didn't like.

Great happy hour.  Friendly service. Great food.  Great cocktail/wine/beer offerings. AWESOME patio seating.  I will definitely be back and I will definitely be telling everyone I can about this place and I will definitely be bringing friends.  Great job in making a local restaurant shine!

Great food, great atmosphere, great drink menus and pricing.  I got to meet one of the owners which doesn't happen that often these days so that was pretty cool too.  The place SMELLS AMAZING!  The guests sitting at the bar next to me were raving about their food so that was good to hear too... I loved my chopped salad too.  I am excited to go back soon!  I was really glad that I chose that place for my lunch.

What a great find!!  It is different than any of the other Tex-Mex place in town.  First things first though, if you've never been, make sure to look over the menu before you get to the register to order - it makes things better for everyone!  The portion sizes are generous, the prices are bank account-friendly and patio seating is available.  It may be a little awkward for folks who aren't used to their quick-casual style of service - you order at the register, get your drinks, find a table, they call your number, you go get your food.    A pretty decent beer selection too.  I missed out on the Margarita-with-a-Corona-in-it creation but that's something I'll try on my next visit because I will be back.

I love this place!!  I love challenging myself, I love being able to work at my own pace and I love that these guys actually know my name.  It's a unique experience so if you are looking for a great place to work out and be social if you want or you just want to go in and do your workout (and it's kinda like playing a video game) - this is the place for you!  It's not a beef-cake factory - just normal people trying to get a little healthier!  Check it out!

What a great find!!  How can't a place with wine on tap be great?!  The atmosphere is really neat and the service from the bartender was very engaging.  Although I didn't eat on my last visit, the menu selections were enough to make me want to go back.   They had a nice wine selection and cocktail and beer selections for everyone.  I can't comment enough on the great decor - it is amazing to me as I knew how the place looked before it was renovated for this concept.  It's so open and airy!     I was happy to find out that this fellow that owns this place is a relative (son I think but I don't want to start rumors) of the folks who own Wally's American Pub - one of my favorite places to go when I lived in Arcadia.  I really like to keep it local whenever possible!

The food was really good.  I had the chicken lime salad, the kids had a cheese crisp and beans and my sister-in-law had a big burrito that she loved.   The atmosphere is really nice as the new location is a vast improvement over the last location.   We had a new server so you want to give them the benefit of the doubt but she was pretty bad.   Ordering a margarita from her was a bit of a nightmare - not going to lie.  I had to send it back and of course got the excuse that it was the bartender's fault.   Don't order iced tea though if you are not a fan of sugar or sweet n low - that's all they have.

Great beer (duh) and great food!  The menu was concise and paired well with the beers we selected.  My kid had this amazing Vanilla Jellybean Soda, and my beet salad and pretzel were awesome!  My hubby liked his burger and fries.  We were planning on brats for dinner so we had to pass on them for lunch.  It will be on the list the next time we visit.  Disappointing were the mustards, really.  For a German themed restaurant, bland mustards are NOT the way to go.    The bonus was that we got to meet one of the owners.  To be fair, it was the first week it opened so they were very active in the operations.  I don't think that will last much longer if it is still going on.  Our server was a little odd... made for a couple uncomfortable interactions.  He wasn't horrible, just odd.  I think we got an incorrect beer too - hubby is a professional brewer and I have worked in craft beer and wine for almost 10 years, we kinda know our beers.  BUT we are totally going back and we are totally sitting in the beer garden.  Parking stinks though.  Just know you will be parking a little ways away.

Yikes!  Please allow 2+ hours for dining service...  The food is decent and the beer and wine selection is very good however I think the service needs a little attention.  There experience we had there was just... odd.  From the host taking our name for the wait (quoted 25; waited 45 - I get that it's an estimation, just communicate this with the guests).  There was a back room not being used for guest seating and someone had to bring us some chairs because my family and I were sitting up against a wall waiting for our table - the most odd thing about that was that was a perfect spot for some more tables and seating.  I've been there 2 times now and I really would like a good place to thrive there - I hope this feedback is some help...

Love this place! The food is fantastic, the drink lists are extensive and the food is spot on every time. Oh - and the scenery and ambiance is amazing! We've only been here about a dozen times and we finally got a membership to the gardens to visit after our brunch.

Love this place!  Great atmosphere, great food, great beers, and cool drinks.  They seem to have some great happy hour specials but brunch is where it's at.  We'll be back for the grill cheese and beer thingie too.

Overall - mediocre at best.  This time we had baked wings, meatballs and pretzels.  The food is ok - service is spotty, slow even. (I waited for quite a while to be acknowleged then nearly twice as long to be acknowledged again to place my order - I had to re-order the pretzels; just a little disconnect there)   The beer selection is pretty good but these days, that's almost a standard.   I am certainly confused about the theatre atmosphere...

While the food was good, service was still slow.  We waited for more than 10 minutes to be created - I got up and got a manager.  Even after that another manager brought us out our food.  I think a server assistant refilled our waters and eventually a server brought us our bill.  While teamwork makes the dream work - I am pretty sure that knowing at least someone's name and engaging in some kind of conversation is the ante in to a full service restaurant.

I am a great fan of this place. Their draught beer selection is great, food is spot on for the environment and there is great parking. There is a great selection of canned/bottled beers as well, I just prefer draft. Come here, relax and enjoy.   The ONLY downside is there is little foot traffic, so don't come to people watch outward - the people watching has to happen inside.  Cheers

Fantastic location. Great selection of house and guest beers. Great food too!    This place is new. While I have had terrific experiences my past 3 visits, they are still working out a couple minor tweaks.
