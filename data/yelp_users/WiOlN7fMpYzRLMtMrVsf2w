Tasty wines and good snacks... I'd go again, although they don't know what the yelp offer (free sample) is and never bother looking into it for you... Though we did go in with a wine tasting and cheese platter groupon so that may be why. Nonetheless, cute shop with a lot of choices. AND did I mention the beers available are crazy cheap!!

The plumber showed up on time and did a great job.  He even replaced the old copper water flex tubing with stainless steel to avoid future corrosion with the piping.  He explained what he was doing and gave instructions on how to re-light the pilot on the water heater if needed in future.
