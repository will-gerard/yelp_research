Kind of a dive, but friendly and efficient service, and the food is consistently good.  Their fried pickles are surprisingly good. My bf is a huge fan of their salmon dinner.

Phenomenal food and atmosphere....one of my favorite places.  Parking is a hassle, but well worth it

I have brought several of my cars here that left other mechanics stumped. I've been very impressed and will use them again.

Used to be one of my favorite places until a friend of mine and I came down with food poisoning that made me wish for death. Notified them and they apologized and said they'd send a gift card for a future meal. Never received it, but would NEVER go back anyway.
