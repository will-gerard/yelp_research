I saw Dr Lykin and thought he was very professional. He'll take the extra time needed to answer any questions and he's very friendly. He took the time to checkup on me at the hospital the day after the surgery. The scar after my surgery was very small and other medical professionals have commented on how good it looks. The office does offer forms on their website that you can fill out prior to your visit which is great way to save time. The biggest surprise was the refund I received because I was overcharged for my surgery. The office probably could have kept the amount which was over $100 and I wouldn't have known. So I think their name is fitting.

Be prepared to wait a long time. Took my wife here and it took almost 2 hours to get in even with an appointment.

Very tasty food once you find the combo of entrees that taste the best to you. The Jade Chicken and Pork are my favorite. The cookie that comes with the meals are delicious.

My wife and I decided to try this place because we were in the area and hungry. The food was all lack luster and bland like the owners don't care. I saw items that looked like they were sitting there for days. The crab legs had not flavor and didn't taste right. My wife said she saw an employee push food off the counter back into the food for the general public. They had vanilla pudding with crunchy cookies that was disgusting it runny and the cookies were soggy. The name of the restaurant is fitting because it's crazy to eat here.

The fried chicken is awesome and the portion sizes are huge. The only thing I didn't like was the peach cobbler. It was like eating peach soup because it was watered down.

My fiance is trying to eat healthier and avoid meat products so I'm trying my best to limit my meat consumption. We were in Scottsdale and found this nice little restaurant nearby. The service was a little slow but everyone was very friendly. The cucumber rolls with peanut sauce were delicious. The Golden Soy Chicken Delight was really good it was hard to believe the chicken was actually tofu. We will plan on visiting this restaurant again the next time we're on that side of town.

I've gone by this place many times on my way to the Culvers next door and decided to finally try it out. The chicken kabobs looked good on the menu but they were really dry like they were cooked and reheated. The vegetables and rice were okay but I've had better. The person I was with had the gyro with fries. They said gyro was good but the fries were awful which I agree. The fries had no flavor and looked like they were fried twice. I will avoid going to this restaurant in the future.

The food was good and serving sizes were enormous. Everyone was very friendly and the lady at the counter was in the words of my girlfriend adorable. The beaver cookies are awesome it was like eating a lemon meringue pie.

Been to the Squash Blossom twice and have been happy with both visits. The food was really good for the price. Waitresses were very nice and polite. Banana Pecan French was awesome left the restaurant in a food coma. The bacon and eggs was really good. The fruit and small red velvet cupcake with the meal was nice. Give this small business a try if you're in the area.

The chicken fingers were good but everything else was lackluster. The coleslaw was bland and the french fries were terrible. The french fries always get soggy and cold too quick when I eat to go. The last visit they also flat out forgot to provide the Texas toast in both the meals I ordered. I was pretty surprised because I saw the girl at the front counter check the meals before she put them in a bag. The quality needs to be more consist.
