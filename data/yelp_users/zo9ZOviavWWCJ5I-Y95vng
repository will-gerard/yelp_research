So amazing! I was hesitant on going, but glad I did! Best biscuits I've ever had! A little pricey and the corn bread was a little dry, but most of the food was perfect and great atmosphere.

Just ate here for the first time on Monday and I was impressed. A little pricey, but good food and good service. Plus great location for dinner and a movie! I couldn't eat more than two slices because they're big and filling. It was interesting having white sauce, but really good still. Makes good left overs as well.

Worst customer service! A bunch of people working and took a few minutes to take orders. Then my iced coffee came up with no cream, so I asked the girl to put in the cream, and she got an attitude when she did, then didn't even stir it before giving it back. Then my friend got hers back and asked if it was supposed to have whip cream on hers because it never did before, the girl gave her attitude about that too. Worst Starbucks I've been too and it doesn't taste good either.

Was a lot of fun! I like that they get he audience engaged and keep you guessing the whole time. The food wasn't bad, but not a very big portion. I laughed the whole time and met some interesting people. I'd go again and encourage you to go too!
