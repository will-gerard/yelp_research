Liberty Market is amazing! Their food never disappoints and their coffee is crave-worthy. When the weather is nice, it's perfect to sit outside, enjoy the reason we live in Phoenix metro, and enjoy what Liberty Market has to offer.

One word....YUM! I had the buttermilk. It was amazing. I'm still thinking about it 12 hours later. Can't wait to stop in next time I'm in Glendale. Oh, and $5 for 6 delicious donuts - can't beat that!

When we used to go to there, my kids always left Airworx hurt in some way, usually from poor supervision in the Dodgeball area when some kid aims at the head and is not taken out.   One of my biggest complaints is the rule of no outside water. My kids are past diaper and stroller stage, so I have nowhere to "hide" these items. I walked in one day, had my water bottle taken from me, was forced to drink nasty drinking fountain water, or spend money on bottled water. Then, I looked over and watched all the moms pulling water bottles from their diaper bags and strollers. Nice rule, Airworx!  To top off my frustration with Airworx, I sent them an email about the water situation, and also told them about an incident when they had freshly painted a cubby DURING BUSINESS HOURS, my daughter sat in it, I let them know, and was never contacted by a manager. I received a poorly edited email back where they forgot to change all the references of "she" (obviously a lawyer had advised on what to say back) to "you," promising reimbursement for the skirt. I emailed them back with my address and never received a check or another email.

I love to find a locally own restaurant. Nothing beats it! The owners of this delightful cafe are friendly and kind, as well as great cooks! The food is amazing. I have loved everything I've had there, from the quiche to the soup to the delicious lemonades, and for a treat, the scones.  Highly recommended!

I love Nosh! It's wonderful to have such a delicious, trendy, and locally owned business in the neighborhood.   I have been to Nosh for just drinks, appetizers and drinks, as well as dinner. Every time, it was delicious and the staff was friendly.   I love the changing menu. It's a surprise each time and gives me a chance to try something new.
