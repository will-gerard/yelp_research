This is a great family owned Chinese restaurant. The sesame chicken is excellent (if ordered extra crispy). The spring roll is an excellent addition to any meal and they are spot on with the lo mein. They are fast with delivery and carry out; and thief customer service is a bonus!

I love Mexican food, and this is one of my favorite places to go. The food is always made fresh and they are always super friendly when you walk in. They don't mind making orders custom and that is a major plus in my book. I recommend if you are ordering takeout that you call ahead. Especially on a Saturday, we wait can get a little bit long. It is definitely worth it though!

The drive-thru at this location is HORRIBLE. You pull up and they don't even greet you promptly. I said hello four or five times before somebody responded. Then they were extremely short with their responses. I am not usually one to complain and I understand that working in fast food can be chaotic, but there's no excuse for a lack of customer service. I don't think I will be back to this location.

The food here is always good, but the customer service is FABULOUS! They are always friendly and smiling. The wait times are never too long.   The potatoes are my favorites but you'll need to ask for them extra crispy. Otherwise they come out just shy of mashed. And the biscuits and gravy are excellent.

We went in looking for granite, and had very little information. The entire staff was friendly and extremely knowledgeable on the entire process. Diana was so attentive and made us feel right at home. We brought our small child, not knowing they were unable to go into the actual showroom and they were so great about explaining the process and making us comfortable while we waited for one another to browse.  I have never experienced such great customer service!

This salon is great! I know that every time I come here I will leave with cute nails and they are always done in a timely manner. No waiting around for 20 minutes. They always ask to make sure I like the shape of the nail and the color that I chose. The best part is their prices are unbeatable, especially for gel manicures! It's an overall win! I don't go anywhere else! :)

I am in IKEA junkie. I feel like for the price that they charge in the quality of the product that they provide it is more than awesome. I don't go here too often, but even the cafeteria is yummy!

This is by far one of the best "quick" burger places in town. It's always great quality and consistent everytime I go there. THe customer service is a puls too.

I cannot say enough about this company. They were fabulous. David came out within a few short days of my call and assessed my entire situation. He listened to my needs and concerns and created a plan of action going forward. He was upfront and honest about all the chemicals he would be putting in the house and how to treat the situation with having an infant that is mobile. I will definitely be utilizing their service again.   Not to mention that the pricing is more than fair. I initially purchased the yelp coupon, and I was expecting a jump in price when I scheduled future services. They are extremely competitive with pricing and they show up when they say they will.   Thanks David!
