Hands down worst gluten free cupcake I've ever had. I cannot believe anyone would associate that product with their name, it was terrible.  Not only are all the other bakery's gluten free cupcakes superior to this one, but so are the grocery store box mixes like the gluten free Betty Crocker or Pilsburry. This was the first time I've ever thrown away dessert half-way through, I always finish or save it for later. The vanilla flavor wasn't the problem. It was so dry, that I had to take a sip of water with each bite because it would get stuck in my throat. If you're at Fashion Square and craving a gluten free treat, do yourself a favor and go to the Macaroon place. I'm disappointed, especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax. The one star is for gluten free cupcakes only, as I have not (and cannot) try a regular one.

This place doesn't need any more reviews to reveal how delicious it is. I just need to crown it BEST TURKEY BURGER IN TOWN!!! None of the other gourmet burger restaurants have comparable turkey burgers... and I've tried a lot! They're always consistent and awesome, doesn't matter which burger you substitute turkey for, all good!

Viva la brussel sprouts! Do yourself a favor and get them. Perfectly charred and fantastic. Even the presentation was the best I've seen yet for brussel sprouts! Our waitress said they are the number 2 selling item on the menu, the number one being the grouper sandwich.  Everyone in our group this evening loved their meal! We all had those "oh my gosh this is good!" moments. Even our friend from Italy gave two thumbs up on her Wild Mushroom Pappardelle, which is a big deal coming from her. She said order it as is, do not add meat, as the flavors were perfect and balanced!  She then lamented that Italians don't put chicken, shrimp, etc on their pasta the way Americans do!  My husband really enjoyed his grouper sandwich. Our friend loved his Gnocchi & Short ribs, but he wished the dish had a larger portion. To be fair, he was warned by our waitress ahead of time about the portion size. My salmon and spaghetti squash was excellent. My piece of fish was really fresh, large, and well prepared. Our side of cauliflower grits were delicious as well and worth getting.   Twisted Root, Twisted Grove, I don't care what they end up calling it... we will all be back! We also all decided that we preferred this over Grassroots. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. For me, I have to crave and day dream about going to a particular restaurant to make it 5 stars.  Side note: The owner was the only person smart enough to convince the landlord to construct a wall in the restaurant reducing the enormous square footage by 50%. I believe that's part of the reason why all other restaurants failed in this space, way too massive of a footprint which caused them to always look empty!

I may have almost shed a tear when I found out an O.H.S.O would be going in at Tatum and Shea. I waited (sorta) patiently, and finally got to eat there yesterday evening. I was happy that there was a sizable crowd when I arrived at 9 PM on a Wednesday. God bless late night eateries. And super god bless late night eateries that just so happen to also be breweries- YES!  5 stars for ambience! How in the world did they turn that unassuming, bland strip-mall location into something wonderful with great character?! It reminds me of the Vig uptown and the Yard. The design is more creative than the other two locations, and much larger. Also, as an ex-Boing employee, I appreciate the giant helicopter blade fans!  Of course, as the place just opened, there are still a lot of kinks to work out. I had been hearing rumblings in my neighborhood about warm beer, messed up orders, and bad service. My husband and I ended up experiencing some of that as well. I ordered the Summertime Cocktail, a muddled basil drink, and they forgot the the basil! Maybe that's karma for not ordering beer at a brewery? My waiter was nice of course and brought out a new one. Our table took "wobbly" to a new dimension. It was as if it was missing a leg entirely. It was a good laugh though, it almost felt like we were being set up on a hidden camera show.  My husband, who has the largest appetite of anyone we've ever met, ordered the diablo burger and only ate half! Good value. I got the blackened salmon tacos. Salmon is not normally my favorite fish for tacos, however, this really worked! The seasoning and flavor was nice. This too was a hardy portion for fish tacos. My only complaint was the under-seasoned, very soggy coleslaw. I'm guessing everything will vastly improve in the coming months.  I've definitely had worse experiences at newly opened restaurants (eg: the opening of Pomo at Gainey Ranch, sheer disaster, twice.)  I will be back, often! I'm still grateful this place opened up in my hood!
