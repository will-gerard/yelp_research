Frank does an amazing job! I'm so glad that I discovered this place. I bought the groupon and have been back 4 times now!  The place isn't super fancy bit it's super affordable and I love the way Frank does my hair! I definitely found my new stylist; and my mom and sister are going there now too

I've only ordered from here, but have done it about 5 times now. The language barrier with the people who take your order over the phone makes it pretty difficult, but if you can get past that the Mongolian Beef is sooo worth it! I love that stuff! Its spicy and the grilled onions are amazing. I didn't even know I liked onions that much!  But the eggrolls are greasy and just taste bad. I don't think you should have to cover them in sweet and sour sauce to make them good. Also one time I had the Kung Pao chicken and it wasn't even kind of special. I was bored with it and halfway into it looking for somethng else to eat.   I don't know, maybe I shouldn't give this place such a good review then, but the rice and mongolian beef make me love getting food from here

I went here yesterday and was soo dissapointed. I really needed a car wash, mostly on the inside of my car so I decided that I would "splurge" and get the superworks car wash, 2 steps up from the basic wash.  It was a disaster, They did a terrible job of cleaning it, there were more then a few spots that looked like they weren't wiped down at all.  And they didn't put the air freshner in my car!  I had to stay for after they were finished and tell them everything that was wrong with the car. It was really awkward cause I felt rude having to point out all that they didn't do, but I really neeeded my car to be cleaned and I paid double of what I would of on a basic wash so I figured I might as well get it fixed while I was there.  I felt even worse becasue the staff were all so nice, we'll  mostly the main guy that was helping me. He sincerely apologized several times and hooked me up with a free car wash card for next time, so that was nice. But I  kind of feel like I still need a car wash, so I might be  using that really soon.  It just seems like the owner of this place has checked out and doesn't really care about it anymore. It seems like the staff is left up to their  devices and  are trying to do the best they can with the place.  I am totally guessing but that's the vibe I got from it.  The store was empty which was dissapointing because I was planning on buying accessories for my car and a snack for the wait.  Then there were no paper towels in the bathroom and the girl behind the counter said that she had asked her boss to get more but he never did.

I love everything about this place; how its decorated, the delicious food, and the friendly staff. I had the egg salad sandwich and it was perfect, just like my mom used to make, I haven't had a sandwich like that in a while. And the caprese pasta salad is sooo yummy. I can't wait to go back and try more  I wish this place was closer to my house because I would probably go there everyday! But it is defiantly worth the drive to support such a great local business.

uggh I loath Applebees! It's like the Wal-Mart of restaurants. So corporate, cheesy, and generic. And it's not even cheap! People: Don't go to places like this, local mom and pop resturants are soo much better

I LOVE this place! I miss it. I used to live on Ash so I would get it all the time but now that I live in Mesa I never go there, it's just too far. And even though I work in Tempe it would be a pretty heavy lunch, well at least what I always get, the calzones!  They're sooo good, and worth the price. The ingredients seem really fresh and the dad and daughters that are the staff are so sweet.  I wish there was one of these by my house in Mesa!

This place is super cute, it reminds me of Casey Moore's in Tempe. The food was pretty good but not amazing like I was hoping for. My friend told me that it was the next best thing to pizzeria bianco, so after hearing all the raves about that place (but I still unfortunely havn't been myself) I was certain the Cibo would be really good.  Everything in there is nice and cute, the kitchen, design, even the bread they serve before the meal. But my firends and I spit their house salad which sounded really good to me, but the greens were really stemy.  Then we got a pizza and I loved the crispy crust, but it wasn't anything to die for. But then again my friend took it upon herself to add garlic to it, which I think might have ruined it, so I defintiey want to give this place another try and eat a pizza how it comes.

it's like a grown up Casey Moores! So cute and I was soo loving the saxaphone player with the DJ. The food was good too, I would be interested in trying more of the food here because I hear good things about the chefs.  I think I really like this place, but fear it may be a little too yuppie-ish, but we'll see!

I love Lush and almost all of their unusual cosmetics that I've tried. I'm addicted to the Coalface face wash, it's the first product I've found  in years that always leaves my face feeling super clean without drying it out. It also has helped me to keep clear skin all year round.  Their bath bombs are so much fun and a great excuse to take a load off and relax in the tub.  Hmm what else have I tried? Ooh their Big shampoo is awesome. It's kind of weird at first because its like you're putting exfoliant on your head but once you add water you get a great lather going and it ;eaves me with big shiny hair with a lot of volume.  And on top of all of this all the Lush people I've ever dealt with are super nice and very helpful :)

I was soo dissapointed with this place. I was hoping that it was going to be a New York style deli like Chompies, but it was more like hospital cafeteria food. For a deli they don't even have good bread choices. I asked for 9 grain and I got this crappy faux weat bread, you know the weat bread that is brown but basically just white bread with no nutritional value. Then the mayo they used on my sandwich was nasty, and I asked for rosted red peppers and they gave me this weird pepper oil spread instead. My side was a handful of crappy potato chips, there were no other options. :( The side was My sister got the salad bar and while she kind of liked it, I thought it sucked. The only fruit they had was covered in fatty yogurt and cake!  I would never go back to this place again, it's just overpriced cafeteria food. Oh and the manager starred at me and my sis the whole time, it was awkward!

So it seems  that I just went to a really bad, ghetto Jason's Deli. I recently went to the Mesa location and it was really good. I loved the salad bar and that they had so many healthy options, I was very pleasantly surprised! And their multi-grain crackers are awesome.  On an unhealthier note the giant baked potatoes are crazy but soo good!

I love this place! Its so charming and makes me feel so inspired. I love all of the antique/ vintage items they have, and the prices are great! Its like they went and did all the hard work by searching antique and thrift stores for all of these cute / rare things and have it all there for customers for such reasonable prices.

I guess you guys agree with me, but if this place isn't good why are they ALWAYS packed?! I'm so confused. And during my 8 years of living in AZ people around me all seemed to love Macayo's, another thing I don't get, because I think the food is nasty. It's inauthentic and makes you feel like crap after you eat it.  I like the idea of the restaurant with all the bright colors and the cool patio, but the place is actually really dirty. Now they don't even have taco salads anymore! What kind of Mexican restaurant gets rid of their taco shells??  If you're looking for Mexican food go up the road to Si Senor, that place is amazing!

I really liked this place and will definitely go back but its far from perfect. Not the cleanest or nicest place, but that's cool with me I'm used to going to crappy run down spots in Chicago that have amazing food. I got the Del Ray Torta, OMG it was crazy! Sooo good though! Its like the biggest sandwich I've ever had. I also had the watermelon juice that was so delicious!   Disappointments include:  music that was too loud no tortilla chips?! they only have ruffles!

I used to really like it here, but now everytime I go I end up dissapointed. Its really not that good and so overpriced. I do love the decor and the family dinning they support it allows you to really spend time with the people you came with.

Delicious!! I was so excited to see such a chic (but unpretentious) place in downtown Chandler. It really brings a great vibe to the downtown area. The food is amazing, as fresh as it gets, and the drinks are strong and yummy! They have a huge wine list and the owners really know what they re talking about and don't mind helping you choose. this is the perfect place for a dinner party.

I think this place is great, although a lot of the time the staff consists of bratty high school kids who act annoyed that they have to help you.

I went here twice since then and the workers were much nicer, no bratty attitudes, still teenagers but thats fine with me. Now I'm obsessed with this place, the food is sooo good! I love their bread and the ton of lettuce they put on your sandwich. My favorite so far is the warm roast beef, try it, it's great!

Soo excited that I finally went here. I loved everything about it; the atmosphere with the candles and awesome music playing on the juke box, the service, and the food.  Last night we went and sat out on the patio and I was in heaven! the weather was perfect, Heidi the owner was great, and I was so releived to finally find a cool place with good food by my house.  I got the spicy asiago chicken pasty and it was great; and I think I might go back already today, and get the Rosemary chicken! yay finally a place with a little culture :)

I love this store! The prices and staff are amazing!! I wish I could remember the name of who helped me last time I was there becuase she was fantastic. I've been to tons of shops in my quest to find a dress and she was the best even compared to some of the very high-end boutiques.

I was so disappointment with this place! We were the only people in there (on a Saturday night, when they should be ready for crowds) and we waited waay too long for crappy sandwiches! They were way over priced and awful. The sandwich was all bun with very little meat. The cheese was not real cheese whiz and dripped off the sandwiches like water. What a shame, we were really looking forward to some great cheesesteaks

I love the idea of Genghis Grill and used to go to the Tempe Marketplace location a ton. I love to make my own bowls and I think the quality of the food is really good.   This location was a hot mess though! We went last week and were so disappointed.   Our server explained that his "boss forgot to renew the liquor license."   Ok, I don't know what's worse... forgetting to renew something so important to a restaurant, or having employees who would tell guests something like that. We heard him say the same thing to 2 other tables!  Then we proceeded to watch our server flirt with the hostess while the majority of what seemed like unsupervised staff, jerk around while we waited for our food.  I kind of felt like I was in that movie "Waiting," which made me a little nervous to eat my food lol    I'm sorry to give this place such a bad review, but I feel like I owe it to the owner to let him or her know what's going on. If they could only get it together this place could be awesome!   It has everything you need to make a successful restaurant.. good location, great concept, great food, good prices.  It just seems like the owners have given up.  If they turn things around I would go back.

My organization hired DJ Adidas for a large community event that we held.  We couldn't be happier with the services that he provided to our guests!  Not only was he an amazing DJ but he was also flexible, kind and very entertaining.  I'm so glad that we found him.  We will definitely request his services again for future events!

Definitely the best nail salon that I've been to! Great, comfortable atmosphere and the technicians are all very professional. I'm always treated so well while I'm here. I love the decor and how ventilated the space is. I also love that they play great girly movies which contribute to the relaxing expierence. They give water bottles and do whatever they can to make sure that you are comfortable. I also like that they pay attention to the customers rather than speaking to each other the whole time like I often see at other nail salons. I definitely recommend Polish & Pamper and am so happy that I discovered it!

I LOVE this place!! I love that it's family owned and that they make everything from scratch. Sure that makes the orders take a little longer, but I would rather wait for fresh food then have something pre-made come out quickly.   My family and I went here for a birthday dinner and they made us feel so welcome. The owner even came by to check on us and chat with us, which was a really nice touch!  My husband and I pick-up food from here all the time.   Everything we've had has been great. Amazing calzones, great pizza and best authentic pasta dishes in town  Definitely the best Italian restaurant we've found in the valley (and we've been here for 12 years)!
