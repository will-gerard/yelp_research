My kids ALWAYS want to come here! The pizza actually doesn't taste bad! One of my children doesn't particularly care for sauce, so the garlic bread pizza they serve is right up his alley. The weekday lunch buffet is a great deal. They even let a child age 2 or under eat it for free (Yes, A child, as in limit one.) Salads are available - as part of the buffet or served as an entrée.   Peter Piper coupons can be found on their website, and you can also sign up to receive offers via email. The deals are pretty good, too. They are usually for some sort of pizza and token combination.   I have had birthday parties for my kiddos here. Things went very smoothly each time, and the pricing was quite reasonable.   The kids love the games and play area. It's pretty clean. However, it gets busy here quickly. Some parents don't watch their kids, so there are usually a bunch of kids running amok, climbing on arcade games, etc. Aside from that, this is a fun place with decent food and pleasant employees.

My palate would say this place is mediocre at best. My digestive tract would declare, "stay away!" Yuck. I was a patron here one time...and I believe it will stay that way.

DO NOT GO TO THESE CROOKS! Totally wishing I could give zero stars to this money hungry business. They do not care about their patients, only the almighty dollar.  Long story short, they demanded my full insurance deductible amount paid to them by the halfway point of my pregnancy or else they would refuse to see me. They didn't care when I explained to them that when the time came for me to pay them after the delivery of my baby, I would not have a complete deductible amount due. I would have paid some of my deductible off elsewhere, like for the facility charges. But, like a fool, I gave them a chunk of my savings account -- out of fear they'd dump me like a bad habit and I'd have to find a new OB in my third trimester (ugh). Anyhow, they screwed up the billing to my insurance. Of course. To this day (three years later), the claim has not been approved by my insurance, because of the faults of Goodman & Partridge's incompetent billers. I was able to convince one of the billers to reimburse a portion of my cash (yay!), but what they kept from me is only a guess (a generous guess, at that) of what I would have owed them had they appropriately billed my claim. Grrrr. (Again, this was the very abridged version. I was on the phone with my insurance company and the Goodman & Partridge Billing office on a regular basis for almost 18 months. Enough is enough; losses cut.)  While I'm at it...the front desk staff is unprofessional, rude, and just plain snobby. (Sure, I'll stand there and wait 5 minutes to schedule my next appointment so you three girls can finish giggling amongst yourselves and send that text out on your iPhone.) The medical assistants and doctors treat expectant moms like a number and the majority of my visits were rushed. The wait times were pretty crappy sometimes -- 40 minutes is a bit much.  The office is decorated very nicely with movie themes and is meticulous (ok, maybe that's where they can earn the one star I gave them). It's too bad that same level of attention is not applied to their patients.   And stop trying to bribe customers with free massages.  That blurb that they have printed on their receipts?  Something along the lines of "if you like us, tell a friend; if you don't, tell us"...? Well, I told you, my friends, and the yelp community - I Don't Like You, Goodman & Partridge!

I enjoy being a Costco member, even though the membership costs are a tiny bit sucky. But I understand they must do what they need to do in the wholesale business.   Typically, I'm able to get good deals on items, but not always. Do your homework, people, if you have the time. Sometimes, the regular, old grocery store advertises a better buy (yay, Fry's!). The coupons are great, especially on items I was planning to purchase regardless. And unlike the coupon mailer states, you do NOT have to bring the mailer with you to the store to receive the savings -- the cashiers have customers covered (thanks, guys!). The staff is typically personable, too.   My kids can't get enough of the food samples. The "free samples" tactic has worked with me -- I've happily bought a product, because a sample was offered and I found it delicious or my kids really loved it.   I had a positive experience purchasing my latest smart phone from the vendor several months ago. The staff was pretty knowledgeable and didn't pressure me into anything.   Coming from the east coast, I really miss BJ's Wholesale (better prices, better selection), but I'll take Costco over Sam's Club any day!

I was not impressed by this Jamba Juice location today. I was greeted as I entered, so that was a plus. It was downhill from there.   There were two employees working.  They were very slow and very disorganized. It took forever for them to make the four small juices I ordered. I'm not sure why they were so backed up. Customers were actually leaving the building and then returning later to pick up their small orders.   They could use a couple more tables and chairs in the establishment. The floor could also use a decent cleaning. It was disgusting. The napkin dispenser was empty. This place was just sad.   My kids are still alive after drinking their Jamba Juices, so there's a second plus!

Our favorite local Italian restaurant! The bread and the dipping oil with herbs is just amazing. Hubby and I had about three of their little loaves, thank you very much. Started out with the chicken zucchini flatbread appetizer. It was fresh and delicious. Wouldn't have minded if it was a smidge larger, though. Our beverages were a raspberry Italian soda and some Italian beer on tap - both were great tasting!  I ordered the tilapia for my entrée, and the piece of fish I received was massive. Also I upgraded my side to the fettuccine Alfredo. I was not disappointed. My husband opted for the linguine Pescatore. After placing our order, our super nice waitress, Alli, returned to our table to report that the kitchen did not have mussels for my husband's linguine dish. To compensate for the missing item, he was given extra amounts of shrimp & scallops - score! Since this was a complete splurge meal, we finished off with their Chocolate Dream dessert. Ummm...yum! Great atmosphere, great food, great staff, decent prices. Will definitely be returning. (Just not right away - I'm still trying to burn off these calories....)

We are regulars here. Usually, we call in & pick up. The lunch specials are a great deal. I love that they include soup (and fried rice, an egg roll, & a crab rangoon), unlike many of the other local Chinese places. However, if you eat there, it seems the portions are larger than if you take your food to go, and tea is also included. The General Tso's chicken here does not taste the same as that which I grew up eating on the east coast, yet the unique flavor is delicious. We will continue to use Hong Kong Kitchen as our go-to Chinese takeout restaurant.

The last three or four times I have called to place a take-out order, the woman taking my order had an awful attitude, like I was bothering her. On these last several occasions when I have arrived to pick up my food, I was not greeted as I entered the building, and the female employees hanging out in the front of the restaurant rudely continued their conversation in an Asian language as I stood there, waiting to pay for my food that was sitting on the counter.   The food tasted all right, but the portions seemed to shrink again and the food was not the freshest it could have been (and I even arrived within the ten minute window, as instructed by Grumpy on the phone).  I'm not in any rush to return here & have since begun frequenting Iron Chef in Queen Creek.   Work on your customer service skills, please!

I'd consider myself a cheese enchilada snob, and I completely enjoy the cheese enchiladas at this Los Favs! The place isn't fancy in the slightest and it gets crazy busy during weekday lunch time, so it's definitely a "grab your Styrofoam container and go" kind of joint.

My favorite grocery store! The staff is very friendly and helpful (aside from a couple cashiers I avoid, like red-vest Courtney), the sales are terrific, the interior and exterior are very clean, and the gas points are a nice little bonus.

The best DD around! I have never had a problem here. Can't get enough of energetic Woody at the drive thru -- he makes the coffee ordering experience amusing. The staff is always pleasant. The coffee is consistently good. Can't beat the deal they have during the summer for 99-cent medium iced coffees. Yum!

Great store! I buy most of the meat for my family here. We have never been disappointed with it. I love their wide array of bulk foods. It's convenient to be able to purchase the exact amount of a product I want, as opposed to grabbing it prepackaged off a shelf. I always stop in during the week they advertise their 25% off vitamins and body care extravaganza.  Their regularly priced items are not always economically appealing. I don't mind waiting for the sales to stock up, though. Every Wednesday, customers can take advantage of two times the discounts with Sprouts Double Ad Wednesdays. The weeks' sales begin and end on Wednesdays, giving the public eight days of savings instead of the standard seven. That being said, this store is an absolute zoo on Wednesdays! Also, the parking stinks. I've seen this mentioned by other reviewers, too. The spaces are very narrow, and the lot is not easy to maneuver. My vehicle has earned many battle wounds on my visits here.  I appreciate the organic and holistic products sold at Sprouts, along with their friendly and knowledgeable staff. Keep up the good work!

My favorite local Mexican place! I can't stay away! I absolutely love their cheese enchiladas. Their 99 cent Monday through Thursday deals are nice add-ons. I also like their bean and cheese burritos, although it wouldn't kill them to add a bit more cheese. Sometimes the service is less than stellar (slow speed, credit card machine issues, unfriendly male employee), but nothing awful enough to keep me away for long.

I'm really upset that I am writing this updated review, but I know I have to do it.  Gordo's has gone downhill, people.    The food here that used to always be stellar for me is now extremely inconsistent. On the occasions I have received gross food, it honestly has been really bad.  Their enchilada sauce used to be spectacular all the time (perfect consistency, brilliant amount of spiciness).  But recently, I was receiving a thin, gross, tasteless sauce every other time I ordered the enchiladas.  The last meal I had here, I ordered a vegetarian burrito, chimi style.  They neglected to include the guacamole with my burrito.  That's my favorite part of the vegetarian burrito!  [Sometimes when I order it chimi style, they plop the guacamole on top after the burrito is fried.  When it wasn't on top, I figured the guac must be inside -- wrong!]  Also -- and this part really disgusted me -- I noticed that my chimi had seven super-duper, fried-beyond-belief French fries stuck to the bottom of it.    My husband used to be a huge fan of Gordo's crunchy tacos.  The last few times he has ordered them, the chicken has not tasted right and the taco shells were very mushy.  I guess we kept giving Gordo's chances since we were big cheerleaders for this place from the get-go and was hoping the bad experiences we had here we just flukes.  Doesn't seem like it anymore.  Also, they recently changed their menu and hiked up their prices.  Not cool.  So long, Gordo's, you've lost your Duke & Duchess of check ins.

It's Taco Bell, people. Don't go here looking for the best meal you've ever tasted. For what it is, though, the food is decent, and the staff has really improved on remembering to make and bag all ordered items. Not perfect, but like I said, a definite improvement.   The staff is super perky and positive. They always thank me for choosing Taco Bell, and in return, I always drive off with a smile on my face (and maybe some hot sauce, too...lol).

This is a decent place. Ordered a mini shake and fries with fry sauce (use the yelp check-in offer for free fries!). The fry oil needed to be changed. The shake was delicious - the mini was very large (oh, the irony). Bathrooms weren't the cleanest, staff wasn't the friendliest. The shake was so yummy, though, that Iceberg gets four stars from me!

Our go to place since Aspen Leaf closed. Salted Caramel Corn is my favorite flavor. The staff is always friendly. Great $3 all-you-can-fill cups for their 1 year anniversary today. We also enjoy two-for Tuesdays.

The staff is not particularly friendly, the place is not as clean as I would like, but the donuts are always fresh and delicious!!! I have been to Bosa in the late morning, in the late afternoon, and quite late at night -- the quality of their donuts has never disappointed me!

I'm not sure why I gave this Starbucks location yet another chance today. The service is so irritatingly slow, the baristas I have encountered are always frazzled and unpleasant, and my coffee once again tasted awful. Not worth the time and money. The parking lot and drive thru set up were horrendously designed. This place is just a nightmare.

I was so excited to try this new, nearby Mexican restaurant, only to be thoroughly disappointed. The staff was not welcoming. The prices are not competitive. The portions were ridiculously small. A burrito double the size is available at Gordo's a stone's throw away and for a lesser price! The salsa did not knock my socks off. My Enchiladas had barely any filling and the sauce on top was slight and dry. I will not be returning.

Gave this place another shot. Bad idea. I appreciate the complimentary chips that accompany each order, but they are terribly stale and salty! Yuck! The salsa bar is unimpressive, although I did appreciate that cilantro was available. The enchiladas are still nasty (barely any filling, gross cheese, and dry sauce), and the employees are so blah (smile, darn it!). I will not be giving this place a third try. Adiós!

When I walked in here at 10:00 a.m. today, I was hoping to see an assortment of scrumptious bread products (perhaps of the breakfast variety, given the time of day) and attentive friendly staff. Instead, the first things I encountered were a closed register to my right, a tower of products for sale to my left, and a short line of patrons ahead of me.   I scanned the menu overhead. Nothing offered for breakfast jumped out at me as particularly exciting. There were several staff members behind the counter, some bustling about, others not so much. For the four minutes I stood in that unmoving line, not once did any member of the horde of visible employees greet me, smile at me, or even freaking look at me. This made me unhappy -- hey, Kneaders, let me know you appreciate my business!   As I continued to stand there like the ghost I apparently was, things started to agitate me, like the location of the merchandise mountain blocking the dining area from view and the fact that the bread behind the counter was haphazardly thrown onto wooden shelves (I assume this was the look they were going for, though). I noticed a display case filled with dessert-type items. It was still breakfast time according to their posted menu ("till 11 a.m."). Why weren't breakfast items showcased? Maybe hip Arizonans eat frosted brownies for breakfast and I'm out of touch.  I wish I could comment on the taste of the food, the speed & accuracy of service, portion sizes and what not. Unfortunately, I departed after those four uneventful minutes. This first impression of Kneaders is a crappy one and I don't plan on giving a second chance any time soon. Great job rubbing a bread lover the wrong way!

A five piece strips dinner should contain FIVE strips, not four. Sadly, today was not the first time this has happened to me. Plus the four strips I did receive were cold and tasted like they had been sitting there for a while. Yuck. Get it together, Popeye's!

Today is only this Sprouts' third day of business.  It was nice to see a pristine store, fully stocked and organized.    The only other Sprouts store with which I have experience is the one on Val Vista/Williams Field.  This new store has the same setup as that one, so it was very easy for me to navigate through and locate exactly what I needed.  This location has handheld shopping baskets, Sprouts-standard-size shopping carts, and also the smaller double decker style carts.  I like the assortment!  I witnessed a fellow customer asking an employee a question about a vitamin supplement, and the employee really helped out the woman.  She lead the customer to the appropriate section and elaborated on the products.    Sprouts continues to issue a five cent credit for each reusable bag customers bring in with them.  My bagger offered me courtesy ice for the meat I purchased.  I appreciated that.  Oh, they also have express lanes here!  Convenient!  It wasn't insanely busy on this Friday morning, so I enjoyed shopping without the crowd, but I do not think this store will stay under the radar for long.  Overall, I had a pleasant shopping experience today at this new Sprouts on the corner of Gilbert/Ocotillo.  This will be my new Sprouts location!
