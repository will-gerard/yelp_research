Went to celebrate with a party of 15 and they wouldn't let me in with my daughter because after 4 PM it's considered a bar. Security was extremely lazy in getting management when I wanted to speak to him. Finally he came and explained its the law I understand and respected that so I asked if I could just speak with my party for 5-10 minutes before i left since I drove there and they would not let me eat and was declined. Never going to recommend this place to anybody since not even a simple request could be made, I know it's the law but you can bend it a little for the customer and afford a 5-10 minute conversation.

Pizza was ok , personally I thought it would blow my mind but it tasted a little better than frozen pizza. And the hot Wings were disgusting , they were literally stone cold and some were hot. It like they were frozen for a month and left in the hot sauce , really dry wings. Never coming back... Btw the guy who answers the phone is not very friendly at all when asking for specials and sounded very annoyed when I called.

I work right across the street so its easy to go for lunch. I usually eat the hot deli area(The buffet looking) not the "ready to order" (which ill mention as well). Anyways, After 7:30 pm its $2 for two diff foods, rice/fried rice/ noodles and bowl of soup(Hot and sour or Egg drop) lunch plate special. I go very often so the supervisor and most of the worker know me by now and "Hook it up" lol but I stick mainly to orange chicken(when its crispy),beef and broccolli , curry chicken and potatoes(when it was actual bone in chicken) and sweet sour pork(again when crispy looking). All of those choices are best tasting and better looking, plus just reheat 30 secs in the microwave for a "fresher taste".   The steam rice is good, fried rice is ok and lo mein noodles are a little oily so that why i stick to the steam rice. Now the Soups are really good too, the egg drop actually has egg and tons of it but my favorite is the hot and sour soup which tastes like tamarind which i like with some tofu. Also their Egg rolls are the shit!! I dont like egg rolls but these are really good and crispy plus the sauce that comes with it is great as well.  I occasionally have Boba(Bubble tea) when im tired for quick pick me up and I ussually get the original or mango which is my fav. Its satisfies my craving for sweet and thirst at the same time, all in all its really good stuff.  Now the ready to order menu is expansive but ill tell ya my favorites which the manager loves as well.I have the sweet rice w/ chinese sausage but I tell them to add curry sauce to the mix , it tastes amazing with it!!! I also have the beef pasta cake which is nothing like it sounds, think of an empanada with mince meat inside but softer and crispier shell, its a great starter. I just recently had the Beef noodle soup with egg noodles instead of the traditional and it was great. It was hot , temperature wise and spicy, flavor wise. Very filling and none of the flavors were overpowering. All in all its a great store with friendly deli people.   Lastly just wanted to add since im latino and have had "JUMEX" all my life, they have a great selection of can juice of mango and guava from hawaii and philipines which a lady said make the best juice. I was not dissapointed at all. Very flavorful and nutritious. Also, the bakery is really great too, I have had the coconut custard which looks like a white "flan" but its delicious and also the meat/sweet buns are great as well.

Love the pizza, reverse happy hour special , especially the wings and pretzels. Beer is obviously the best part

Honestly havent had a burger "WOW" me in quite a while.... his little hole in the wall was precisely what I had hoped for. I had the Rocket style (3 patties on a 10 inch roll) Cali burger that has bacon, avocado and rocket sauce, bread is toasted with butter so its not soggy, you can order your burger Med or well done which is a nice touch. My daughter had the corn dogs and even those were surprisingly really good. Go to this place now! Fries are actually great :)  PS. They have something like 500 bottles of flavored soda, check it out if its your thing

The Pho Ga(Chicken Soup) is really good. Its flavorful and good ingridients... Now I also tried the Vietnamese sub, the bread was good and crunchy but the BBQ Meat was "Meh" , nothing too crazy about it. The Spring rolls with shrimp with peanut dip sauce tasted bland as well, almost like it was imitation shrimp, very chewy so it whatevers and then the crunch roll with fish sauce was actually good too. I had a Banana smoothie to wash it down but was dissapointed, nothing too crazy, I wished they mixed it in with milk instead of water because it just tasted watered down. All in all I always come back have the Chicken pho

So I went to this place hoping it would "wow " me since I used to love the original tortas la presa , but boy was I disappointed. As soon I went with friend we waited 20 minutes before they asked us what we wanted to drink and another 10 minutes before they brought it over. The place had maybe 2 tables so it was not busy, so I kept wondering what took them so long to ask for my order. As I was waiting I noticed nobody in the kitchen were wearing sanitary gloves or hairnets(I'll get to that later) , finally when they got our orders; my friend ordered the torta without onions and I ordered they're biggest one called the hipocampo . Our order arrived about 20 minutes later again with not a full restaurant and had to return my friends because it had onions, they offered to redo the torta since it was their mistake. I started eating my torta and I left unimpressed since the milanesa tasted dry/chewy and likely old but definitely not fresh. We waited another 10 minutes for the redo of the order and you can check the picture I uploaded as proof , it came with a nasty hair( remember the hair net mention?). So at that point my friend was disgusted and so was I , so I asked for bill. The lady in the front said she was gonna charge me for both tortas since they had to redo it twice, I was in complete and utter shock that they had the audacity to even think about charging for a mistake they made and another with a disgusting hair on it(very poor food quality) . She kept insisting she wanted to charge me for both and I insisted I was only gonna pay for two horchatas and ONE torta. She said she would look into it by asking the lady chef in the back and I listened since I know Spanish perfectly , her response was "he has to pay for both! He's lucky we don't charge him for all three! We wasted ingredients and product making them" so she came back and kept insisting I pay. She then called her manager and HAD to ask her if she could give me the courtesy of not charging the 2nd torta in which she kept nodding with a negative manner. She finally got off the phone and said in order for me not to pay for the 2nd torta , I would have to write in the back of the ticket "why I didn't pay". I wrote hair on torta in Spanish and paid for the rest of the meal, never in my life have I had such a struggle in getting, paying or eating food. Places like these make other torta establishments look bad in the way they interact and treat their customer. Needless to say , I'm never returning to this place.

Ask for Rosa! Very well trained and entire barbershop is extremely clean at all times. Price per haircut is $13 which is a deal! She speaks Spanish also and does single razor shaves. Must try!

Honestly this place is amazing! Best Mediterranean food I've EVER had in my life and I eat many places. The portions , the quality, the flavor and service were all beyond my expectations. I take my hats off to these guys for making my taste buds explodes classic dishes like gyro plates with basmati rice and chicken kabobs. Both meats were well seasoned and juicy... I'm honestly a customer for life and I will let people know to go here. Compliments to the chef and to the nice waitress expecting a child . You guys made me and my daughter's night!  Sorry about the broken glass cup my daughter dropped ! You guys handled it very professional and I respect that more than you guys know.   Go! Go! Go!
