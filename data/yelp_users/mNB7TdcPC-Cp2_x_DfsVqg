The food is satisfying. We ended up here because no one could decide what they wanted to eat and I parked the car in their parking lot in frustration as it was the first restaurant I saw. There is a lot of Asian food even in the plaza but the colorful tapestry and open tables beckoned me to make an executive decision. Much of the menu was accompanied by little chili symbols, some dishes up to 4 or 5 if I remember correctly so if you like spice this may be a good spot to kill off some tastebuds.

I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.
