I have lived 2 blocks from this place for a year and have not tried it until a friend brought my boyfriend and I here for lunch about 2 weeks ago. We have been back 4 times since! The food is amazing, the service is fast and friendly and the prices are very low. So far we have ordered the #12 pho which is great, perfect flavor, comparable to LA pho. The spring rolls are very fresh, large and delicious. The beef and basil chow fun and spicy sate beef are also amazing dishes. Great flavor and good portions for the price. Also try the thai tea! Very refreshing and delicious! Every visit has been a positive experience.  I cannot wait to try more of the menu.

I have been here so many times now and have tried all of their specialty rolls. Everything is delicious. Our favorite is the tsunami roll, which has no rice. Their calamari in the best I have ever had. I never really ordered calamari anywhere else until I had it here. Now my expectations are too high when I order it elsewhere and I am always disappointed. Also, order a side of the soy jalapenos, they are great on top of sushi.   The restaurant is small and very cozy. It is always very clean and the food is very fresh. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. I have never had a bad experience here.

The fact this restaurant has 4 stars boggles my mind. The service and atmosphere is great but the food, unfortunately was a let down.   We were recommended this place by a friend because of how much my bf loves french dips. We figured for $19 and the rave reviews it would be a great sandwich. If you love bread, not a lot of meat and sub par au jus, then this would be the sandwich for you. I've had plenty of better french dips at local bars, for half the price. We also requested extra crispy french fries, which came out pretty soggy.  I ordered the thai steak salad. I LOVE thai everything, but this salad was just a smorgasbord  of clashing flavors. The filet in my salad was also very salty. Not a very well thought out dish, was only able to eat half of it.   All in all, not worth the price. Disappointing.  Won't be back.

I got off work the other night to find my tire was completely flat. Apparently I ran over a huge screw that embedded itself in my tire over my lunch break. I went over to Discount to have them take a look at it. I get off work at 6, which happened to be the same time they close. I showed up and they stayed open to change my tire. They were so nice and helped me out so much. I definitely recommend this place, great customer service.

I love this grocery store, they have everything. They have a fantastic alcohol and cheese selection. Great sushi made fresh and tons of pre made items in their deli area. Great for lunch. AND THERE IS A COLDSTONE CREAMERY IN THE FRONT, can't get much better than that.

I work close to this location and have come here for lunch many times. The thin crust pizza is very good and they have good lunch specials. If you get the specials the service is pretty quick.  I went to this location tonight with my boyfriend. I ordered the Oregano's Favorite salad and he ordered the Alfredo in the Dark, which was kind of a Southwest take on pasta and cream sauce. I have ordered this salad before and remember is being better. It seemed like it was missing a few ingredients. My boyfriend's pasta was pretty bland, which was a let down because I love Afredo.   I will stick to the pizza.

My parents used to take me here when I was younger, and I remember the food always being good. I just went here the other night for dinner, and I'll have to say, their quality has REALLY gone down hill.   My mom ordered the chicken fajitas. They tasted weird, not like how I remember. They really cut down the size of the fajita sides (sour creme, salsa, cheese ect.) I ordered the baby back ribs. They were seasoned very poorly. It was a sweet and salt rub, but not in a good way. My brothers hamburger was huge, and he loved it, which warrants at least the 2 stars.   Really sad this place isn't what it used to be.

I come for the twice cooked BBQ bourbon jalapeno wings. They are soooo good! You gotta get them extra burnt on the grill, YUM. Free pool on Sundays, which is awesome. They do trivia on Thursdays, which is great if you have a large group of people.

My birthday is on the 18th and my moms in on the 19th. My grandma takes us both here to celebrate out birthdays each year. I have always had a very pleasant experience here. The food is superb, service is good and atmosphere is cozy. I recently ordered the pesce alla vodka, with spinach instead of pasta. It was amazing! The chicken parmesan, garlic bread and eggplant parmesan are also very good. This has always been a special place for me and I would definitely recommend it.

I had a very nice experience here. I came in for a photo facial a couple of months ago, which was done by Sharlene. This was my first photo facial and she was very gently and informative through out the whole process. She is very knowledgeable about what she does. The staff here are very friendly and the atmosphere is clean and welcoming. I am happy with the results and I plan on going back soon.

Should be renamed The Bad Egg.   It takes a lot of dissatisfaction for me to warrant a 1 star for a restaurant. To start, we were quoted a 15 to 20 min wait, which ended up being a little over 30 minutes. There were a lot of people waiting, all the while there were plenty of open tables. Didn't make any sense.   I ordered the half BLTA sandwich and half kale salad. BF ordered the oatmeal, and we ordered a chocolate chip pancake for the little one. It took 45 minutes to get our food. Probably the longest I have ever waited at any restaurant for food, and this was a small simple order! The server was nice, even though there was no apology or explanation for was super slow service. My kale salad had no kale, just mixed greens that were pretty wilted. The sandwich was good, but not worth the wait. Boyfriend's oatmeal was cold. Server offered a Dr.Pepper in a to go cup after dropping offer the bill, which we said we wanted. Waited awhile but she never came back.  Not sure how this place stays open, maybe they were just having a really bad day. Regardless, there are plenty of better places to go for breakfast.

Probably the worst pizza I have ever had.  Took forever to be delivered. Since I was at home, I was able to at least put some garlic & onion powder, pepper flakes, oregano and dip in into some marinara sauce I had in the fridge. Which made it tolerable.   DO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Came here for a birthday dinner. The food is amazing and the service is excellent. Very pricey, but nice for special occasions. I ordered the special, which was a Chilean sea bass with crab meat on top. It was incredibly delicious. Bother got the aged NY strip, which was very good.

I have ate here and ordered take out here multiple times. They are very consistent with fast service and amazing food. Hands down the best biscuits and gravy in town. Very good eggs, coffee, wraps, oatmeal, salad and sandwiches. There is really nothing that I have ordered that I have not been happy with. The service is amazing and very quick. I am glad I work right across the street, it's great for lunch and late breakfast!

Love this place! I have been going for a few years now and have never been dissatisfied with a dish or service. For starters, they bring out a great assortment of bread. I have tried many of their dishes and they have all been very good. I love to get the grilled vegetable salad with grilled chicken and a side of the arrabiata sauce. I have found it to be the perfect combination. My boyfriend gets the chicken marsala with a side of fettuccine alfredo. The fettuccine is amazing. They make the pasta in house and cook it perfectly. Great neighborhood restaurant!

I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH  I regretfully say that I have lived 4 blocks from this place for about 2 years and have only knew of its existence for a couple of months.   The cuts of meat here are amazing. We have tried the filet, NY strip, 4 different seasons chicken breast, and pork chops. Everything has been superb. They also have a nice selection sauces, charcoal, wood chips and beer. There are so many things I have yet to try! They even have seasoned pretzels and amazing seasonings.   I have been in here many times and have always have a great experience.

Pretty disappointed with my last visit.   Went for lunch on a Tuesday with my boyfriend and his daughter around 1:30, it was pretty dead, only about 4 other seated tables. We were seated quickly, waited for about 10 minutes for a server and no one came. We eventually had to go up to the bar to ask for someone to take out order. The bartender was very apologetic, friendly and took our order quickly. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, BF got a bacon cheddar burger and the little one got a cheese burger off the kids menu.   Salad was very tasty with good portions and lot of different ingredients for a nice variety of flavor. BFs burger was bland, and they forgot his onion strings. It was a couple dollars extra for the burger meal to be upgraded with sweet potato fries. They were decent, all 15 of them. The kids meal burger was incredible tasteless with a stale bun. She took 3 bites and refused to eat the rest.   All in all, we will not come back. We were offered a free desert for the lack of service, which was good and a nice gesture, which warrants 2 stars.

If you like quantity over quality, this is the place for you. The food is mediocre at best. I ordered the 2 eggs, hashbrowns with a side of pancakes. It was a lot of food for only $5, but the large portions with cheap prices is the only thing they have going for them. My bf got the chicken fried steak, which he could not finish becuase it was too fatty. We were really looking forward to the biscuits and gravy after reading the reviews. However, we were very disappointed, as they completely lacked any flavor.   If you are looking for good quality food, skip this place.

This is a local place I been wanting to try for a while now. Phoned in an order of jerk chicken and curry goat since that's what most people have given good reviews. The service was nice and friendly. When arriving, the place was quaint, clean and nicely themed for the cuisine.   The goat curry had really good flavor. However, it seemed like every other bite I chewed into a bone, and had to pick it out of my mouth. Not very pleasant. The jerk chicken was very dry and bland. The load of rice and side veggies were subpar fillers for a disappointing meal. I was really looking forward to finding a new local ethnic place. I am very surprised with the 4 and 5 star reviews.

This is one of my favorite restaurants. I have never had a bad experience here or a meal I did not like. My absolute favorite pasty is the "lovely bit of salmon." I have tried some other ones, which were all very good. Meatball appetizer, pate and curry potatoes are also fantastic. Great beer selection and friendly cozy atmosphere. Also, very affordable with large portions. Its about $10 for a pasty and I always end up taking half home.

Great local family ran little restaurant. I ordered the Panang curry and my BF got the Thai basil. Both dishes were very good with great flavor and nice portions. The same person who took our order also made our food, presumably the owner. He was very nice a friendly. Good prices too. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu.

I love this place. We order take out lunch from here all the time. They have a great lunch special for $6.95 that includes entree, steamed or fried rice and soup or salad. The portion sizes are large. Great value for the price. I usually get the spicy basil chicken or panang curry... but usually the panang curry. Why? Because it's the bomb.

All around outstanding dining experience. Our waiter, Sam was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. Nice open casual dining area. I've heard many good things about this place, and let me tell you, the ratings are true. Very attentive wait staff. Never an empty water cup. Price was good for portion size and quality. Lets talk about food now!  Had to take advantage of the great happy hour prices. Ordered the Kilt Lifter Fondue, which was served with sliced pears, sausage and bread chucks. Large portions & very tasty.    We split the chopped salad with smoked salmon. Incredible mix of flavors, every bit was a perfect mixture of awesomeness. This dish is a MUST TRY.  I ordered the crab cakes app as my main dish. They were very good, perfectly cooked with no weird fishy taste. You can tell they are made fresh, not from frozen. Very tasty.  BF got the meatloaf. It was recommended to us by our waiter. Glad we listened to him, it was fantastic. Great flavor, you can tell they use high quality meat. There was a perfect amount of sauce and nice portion of potatoes.   We sampled the bread pudding and chocolate brownie. Both very rich and decadent. We did not try any of the cocktails, but the selection was huge. Maybe next time. Can't wait to come back.

I love Teriyaki bowls and this place has never let me down. They are very consistent, fast and delicious. I order lunch from here occasionally. I like to get the spicy Teriyaki chicken with white meat, low carb style. With the low carb, they substitute rice with fresh steamed veggies. It is great mixture of broccoli, carrots and cabbage. It's a great choice for something healthy, quick and cheap.

Came in for lunch around 1 and the place was pretty dead. Very nice atmosphere and comfortable seating, open dining area but also private dinning areas for large groups. Our orders were taken quickly. We asked for garlic bread as an appetizer. After 15 minutes went by, we asked our server about the bread, she snapped back "it's cooking" and walked off. Two minutes later she brings us a basket of room temp bread slices slathered with cold garlic butter. Not very appealing. Service was very slow considering there was only one other group of people dining.   The chicken caeser salad was decent. Dressing was a little mayonnaisey. Overall, it was a typical caeser salad, nothing special. Best part was their homemade croutons. The Milano pizza was incredibly dull. With as many toppings as it had, I was pretty surprised by the lack of flavor. For $14, there are WAY better pizza options out there. The "Panini" was disappointing. It was more like meatballs between dried out thin pita bread.   Best part of our meal was their Kentucky Mule cocktail. $9. VERY DELICIOUS.   Overall, there are a hundred better options for food in this price range and in this area.

My bf and I live right down the street so we wanted to try this place out. We had read good reviews on the burgers.  The atmosphere was pleasant and service was superb. The food was not that great. I ordered the the hot wing (hot), which were $9 for 10 wings, a little on the expensive side. My boyfriend ordered the smoke jumper burger, and a cup of chili. Our food came out in a timely manner. The wings were not very hot at all and unfortunately did not have too much flavor. The burger was very greasy, with soggy bacon and it too lacked flavor. They don't seem to season their burgers. The chili was bland and came out in a ramekin size cup, for $4.  We might try this place out again for drink and pool, but definitely not the food.

Great local place to grab a drink or a bite to eat. I have been here many times and have never been disappointed with their food. Their burgers and chicken sandwiches are very tasty. They even have good breakfast! Had some relatives over for the weekend and we were looking for a good local breakfast place and decided on Jolie's, based on reviews. I was amazed at the quality of breakfast that came out of this biker bar nightlife hangout. Huge omelets, perfectly cooked hash browns, awesome biscuits and gravy!  Also, they have taco Tuesdays. 99¢ Tacos,. Cheap and delicious!

More people need to know about this place!  We were seated quickly and were immediately brought water. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere is casual, but still nice for a date night.   I ordered the Jager chicken schnitzel, which is thin fried chicken breasts with a brown wine gravy mushroom sauce. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the gravy was outstanding. Each meal comes with a side dish and 3 side "salads". For the side I got the dill mashed potato, which were alright. My sides were green beans, beet salad and tomato basil. All very delicious. I am all about variety and flavor matching, so I love that I was able to customize my meal so much.   Boyfriend got the Polish sampler plate with the two types of meatballs, and potato dumplings. He thoroughly enjoyed his meal, and as did I of the bites I stole. Although this place serves food that traditionally is not spicy, they even had sriracha available.  I was regretfully too full to venture into the desert menu, however I will DEFINITELY be back to try what else they have to offer.

They deliver! Was home on a Saturday afternoon and was looking for something local that could deliver and found this place. We ordered the spicy orange chicken, crab puffs and Hong Kong style curry beef brisket. We were quoted 30 min for delivery, they showed up in 20. The chicken was very tasty was all white meat with no weird chewy pieces. The curry beef was amazing, very good flavor with fresh veggies. The crab puffs were of course great, it's kind of hard to mess up deep fried cream cheese stuffed awesomeness.   We will definitely be back try what else they have to offer.

For starters, the place has a lovely atmosphere. We came in on a Saturday afternoon. They had the large roll up doors open, which allowed a nice breeze in, great way to enjoy a nice day. The service was quite slow. Friendly, but a bit inattentive. The complimentary chips were good, with salsa that actually had a nice kick to it. Now for the main foodz...  I ordered the Fila salad. Very fresh ingredients and nice presentation. Salads are about $10 a pop, then an extra $3 to add meat. It was good, but nothing to rave about. For $13.50 I just wasn't that impressed. BF ordered the Beast burrito, chimi style, with shredded beef. It was surprisingly bland.

I am so glad this place opened! I work in the same complex so it's really convenient for me. The best part about this place is that you can try all of the flavors before you buy them. You won't get stuck with a flavor you don't like, which happened when I used to get my juices online. I have been thinking about getting into the mods and customizing my pieces more. They were really helpful with showing me how to make new wicks and what pieces to buy. Definitely worth checking this place out!

The food is decent, the beer selection could be a lot better, and the service is adequate. I find it very strange how a business that is wilderness oriented serves everything on paper plates with plastic utensils. Not only is it difficult to cut your food with a plastic knife, it is just plain wasteful.

I am so glad I finally tired this place out. The food is very good and fresh. I ordered the 4 soft tacos each with a different meat, carnitas, grilled chicken, barbacoa, and steak.  All of the meats were very flavorful and moist. The steak was my favorite, all charcoaled on the outside and tender on the inside, delicious! My bf had the steak burrito which was also very tasty. Very good fresh homemade tortillas.   It is set up somewhat like Chipotle, where you go down the line and tell them what you want on your order. It is great that they also have a salsa bar. Service is very fast and friendly. Lobby was clean and welcoming. The owner himself was serving the food and was very nice. Great family ran local place to grab a quick bit for not a lot of money.

We are so glad a new local pizza place opened so close to our house! We have ordered delivery from here numerous times now. The pizza always comes very hot and delivered very quickly. We have also tried the cheese bread and garlic knots, both very good. They are always very friendly when taking my order. Have not been into their actual store, but I can say their delivery service is superb.

Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. The ambiance in very nice and comfortable. The food is typical American, a small step up in quality from your average Applebee's. The service was friendly and attentive. We stared with the queso dip, which was decent.  I ordered the Asian chicken salad and the boyfriend got the Tuscan chicken sandwich. The salad was very good, and a little different  with having mango and a touch of mint. The chicken sandwich was pretty average. Everything is very affordable, with entrees  around $10. The food is a solid 3 stars, service/atmosphere 4 stars, price value 4 stars.

Was looking forward to trying this place out. We went on St. Patrick's day around 7pm and the place was pretty dead. When we walked in, no one greeted us and we had to look around to find someone to be seated. Once seated, servers walked by us multiple times with with no acknowledgement of us being seated. Again, we had to get up to grab someone in order to be served. The service is horrendous here.  We ordered the queso burger, wedge salad, Reuben sandwich and pretzels for a starter. The food is good but nothing above your average bar food, and it was pretty pricey to top it off. They have a nice set up with an good sized open patio and large indoor bar area. But nothing else to really make me want to go back.
