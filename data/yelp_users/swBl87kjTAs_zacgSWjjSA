EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT staff. Cannot stress that enough. And the foods were delicious! During the summer, they have the pre fix menu which is $39 for 3 course. That's a pretty good deal. I had the duck ravioli as appetizer, diver's scallops for entree, hubby got the beef fillet and all were so divine!! We had our 4 year old with us and the kid's menu isn't on the list, but your server will let you know. Our daughter had the steak fillet with fries and omg it was really good too lol. The presentation was beautiful as well. Thank you for making my husband's 29th wonderful.

*** I HAVE CALLED VERIZON CUSTOMER SERVICE OVER THE PHONE ON THEIR 1800 NUMBER AND VERIFIED EVERYTHING BEFORE COMING INTO THIS STORE***  The scenario: I am 1 month shy from "Edging up." If I were to upgrade 1 month early, I would just have to pay the remaining 1 month which would be $25 for my S5. I signed up on May 2, 2014. Months before Verizon changed their contract about switching phones. It used to be at least 50% off the retail price of the phone before you can switch. Now it's 75%. Yes, the 50% still applies if you sign up before a certain date. If you however, "renew" by upgrading a phone, the new 75% will be applied. Anyway, I wanted to switch to the Experia Z3V. Verizon exclusive.... I called the store ahead of time to check if they have the phones in stock so I don't waste my time. They did.  Upon entering, I was greeted by a nice lady that eventually passed us to Barbara. While I was waiting for Barbara to be available, my husband took a look at the Experia, both phone and tablet. 5 minutes later, Barbara came to us, looked at us and the phone and just seemed completely uninterested in us. I asked her if there were any promotions about the Sony products, because the man that I was on the phone with earlier said something about bundle package with a watch  (to be fair, I couldn't hear him well due to noises and signal kept cutting off). Turns out that they weren't. So anyway, I told her okay I'll just go see around real quick.  We went to another table to check out the Galaxy Note Edge. Hubby liked it a lot and it suits his needs for stock options. She came over to us and I asked her (I get straight to the point), how much would be for me to pay today knowing that I have 1 more payment to upgrade (2 phones about $50, as I've checked with a sales person over at the VZ call center plus sales tax). She told me that ALL EDGE plans will be $180 for EACH phone out the door because THE NEW CONTRACT STATED THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. I said are you kidding me? What's that? She said it's the bundle and it includes screen protector, case, car charger and another gadget that we like. $180. What the actual f**k. I could go to Amazon or Ebay and spend less than $60!!!! And I said I have never heard anyone saying that we'd be required to pay that $180. She INSISTED that it was part of the contract even though our contract started before the contract was changed. Did I mention she also looked like and sounded like she hated her job? She also told us if you want to you can ask them if you can do 0 money down. THAT IS THE CONTRACT. OMFG. Unless you owe the remaining months. What a joke! Also, we've already researched the pros and cons and specs about the Edge and asked her what she thought about it. She didn't know how to answer so she just tried to talk about the S6 instead and just said "I've heard good and bad things about it." Lol. Really?   Anyway, we left telling her no thank you we'll wait. I called the Bullfrog VZ store in Anthem and asked the guy there if we had to pay $180 to edge up. He said "For what? " and told him the story. He said no.   Never going here again. What a liar!

Love this place. Hubby and I frequent here. My kid loves the satay and thai BBQ chicken. I love getting their soup with coconut milk.

I have found our sushi joint. Sapporo, Ah-So and all those crappy wannabe Japanese places in Scottsdale has NOTHING on this place. This is a hidden gem.   My husband and I came here on our anniversary which happened to be on Easter.  We came during dinner time and thought it was going to be a full house. It was busy, but not full. Lucky us!   We were seated promptly by our female server. She was very nice and helpful! I was very indecisive because almost everything on the menu sounded delicious! Anyway, we started off with Hana Sake raspberry flavor. It was definitely delicious. My appetizer came first and it was quick! I ordered the octopus salad and husband had the baked mussels. I LOVED both appetizers. I'm very picky about tako salads too! Portion was great and they were each both under $10! I requested my salad to be spicy and the chef made the spiciness up to my level. Bravo!   We shared sushi roll plate. It was the crunchy scallop roll with 2 spicy octopus sushi. Both were delicious as well. With the crunchy scallop, you get extra scallops on the side! Idk what sauce they used but it was godsend. Seriously. My taste buds level went over 9000. Hubby actually wanted to order the sea urchin sushi but they ran out that night. No biggie, we were full as heck anyway. Especially with that chocolate pyramid mousse with caramel.   While we were dining, one of the servers dropped a plate by the customer. Hey, things happen. It's life ya know? What surprises me is that the owner (I believe) immediately cleaned up and was very apologetic. They handled it well, unlike many places I go to. The atmosphere was VERY clean to a T. When you enter it's a bit cramped but the seating isn't.   We also tipped the sushi chefs on top of our server despite not sitting at the sushi bar. They worked hard and we were more than pleased with our food. Thank you guys! We highly recommend this place!

I have been here several times now. 90% of the time I am disappointed, but I tend to give several chances to businesses before making a negative review.   1. Upon entering, I find the hostess always seems to be the nicest.  2. If you sit in a regular table, some of them are not as clean. Check the dishes too! Heck even sometimes the tenpayaki table is dirty. 3. Sushis are cold. Contrary to popular believe, sushi is supposed to be served with warm fresh rice. Not cold. The Sushis are meh at best. Flavorless. Like I could buy the same thing at Fry's market for much less -_- 4. Hit or miss customer sevice. Several times different servers keep either serving us wrong drinks or totally forget our orders. Sometimes though, they rock.  5. The Bento lunch special is alright. The box is large but the amount is wtf to a nation that likes everything bigger. Rah Sushi has a better bento lunch box. 6. Drinks are overpriced and tastes god awful. 7. Clean bathroom at least. 8. The tenpayaki chefs are actually great and funny. I do like their menu for that section. It's no Japanese, but it's good. Though overpriced.   This place is no Japanese. Please stop thinking these joints are authentic. They are there to accommodate the majority of Westerners taste buds.

Two star only because my waitress wasn't a b and the cheese dip was good.   This place is like walking into a frat house. The seats felt rather sticky, pretty gross. And since it was dark at night, you don't know what the heck are on those leather. Service was super slow. The waitresses definitely has something to "showcase." My guy friends were definitely starring lmao!   I came here for a friend's bday. The outside patio was packed. Inside was loud, but they played great music. The food, besides the cheese dip is nothing to be raving about. My tamale was dry and overcooked. Either that or it was frozen o.o Guacamole was alright. Salsa was good. Basically foods were meh. Drinks were good though. I don't think I'd come back unless it's for a friend or something. Definitely not my type of scene xD

Unbelievable. Do not go here if you want great quality service. We ordered lunch for a client and was turned down because they were busy. Hello? We have heard of waiting you know. We just want to pick up however long it took. We asked if we can come back later then and they said no. We can't take your order. What kind of establishment is this? Completely absurd.  I have been in there several times to DINE IN with family. Service has ALWAYS been slow. I'm talking about 45 minutes just for 3 mini burger sliders. That's too bad, bc the cook is actually decent.   Won't be coming here ever again.

My first time here. I have very thick and coarse asian hair. I have another stylist that cuts my hair but at $75 for every monthly visit it gets expensive. So I ventured out and found Cleo.   This isn't a 5 star luxury place, but he will listen to you, input his opinion and do the job right. I like how much lighter my hair feels. I look much younger now lol.   The chair at the shampoo station is very comfortable. It's actually the same chair at the salon I used to go to. He's very fast.   I will be gone for 2 months and when I come back I will try his deep conditioning treatment. Overall I'm very happy.

Not sure who Dr. Lori is, but she's long gone. Have been seeing Dr. Smith for quite some time now. Excellent service and great staff. Highly recommended. The membership is worth it in my opinion.

This is my new Viet place now. Better than Angelina Pho & Grill imo. I usually order anything on the Pho or porridge menu. I love porridge and they made it to my liking!   I've never tried anything else, but next time I will try. The price of pho is great and the portion is generous. Love it!   Did I mention how clean the place was? Oh and this place is right next to Belle Reflexology which you guys need to check out.

Update!  Last time I was here, there was no bar and there are some more items on the menu. I ordered the slider : brisket and pulled pork. DELICIOUS! !! Juicy and just melts! You have to try the raspberry BBQ sauce that they offer. They are to die for, so underrated! I came back a couple of times after. Next time, I'll order other things too. The servers that they hire has always been nice and attentive so that's a plus.   Idk what the other reviewer is thinking when he says this place needs Gordon Ramsey LMFAO. I wouldn't go into that deep end. Maybe if this place had roaches and terrible rude servers. Trust me, I've been to a place where they literally just shoved a plate at you and walked away.   In any way, I believe they've improved for the better. The bar area is still small, but this place is the top 2 or 3 places in Anthem for sure. Legends is overrated.

Forget massage envy. Had a horrible migraine going on occasionally this whole year and was prescribed prescription strength meds. The massage from this place helped a lot. It's super affordable which I like. Buy their oil too. My Chinese family has a bunch of these oil lol. Will be coming back.

We stayed last year actually in August for my husband's birthday. The staff were very attentive. I was dressed down and I usually look like a 13 year old when I don't dress up, but they never gave me the "usual" what is this "kid" doing here look that I'd normally get from other places. The golf cart driver guys were nice and delivered our bags to our room and drove us to the underground parking garage to get to our vehicle. We stayed in a 2 queen bed room by one of the adult pools. The room was immaculate, beds were very comfortable and oh my gosh the bathroom!!! The shower was large with 2 shower heads so you know... just wanted to say incase you're going to pull a 50 shades stunt... kidding. The room had a nice size balcony. The main pool was amazing. There was a server/bartender and we ordered mojitos that were yummy. Pool is heated at night. The landscape around were clean and well maintained. People we met there were so nice too. They have several restaurants within the property. Given it was hubby's Bday, we decided to go to Prado. Amazing service and worth the price. The aged steaks just MELTS in your mouth. I had the scallops. We also had room service for every day that we stayed. The server was prompt and the foods were DELICIOUS, of course. Anyway, we are going to come back to this place for sure this year. I loved it so much! Thank you Omni for making our stay memorable.

Food is excellent! Definitely give it a try here. Yes, the other Indian places around this area are not that great. However, when I went to this place, the service was very slow. There were not that many people inside. It was my family (3) and 3 other families inside.  Also, the price is quite high for the portion size. And I can't believe rice and the bread are extra! You know how restaurants have a side of bread or rice with meals? This one didn't so it was disappointing. Luckily, the flavor of their food was excellent. Hence the 4 stars.

Dr. Loud and her staff are SUPERB!!! I had been looking for a new dentist since my last one dramatically changed in service after relocating her office. Anyway, Ann(e?) the front desk/insurance lady is very knowledgeable and helps you understand your bill down to a T!!   Dr. Loud herself is very knowledgeable too and I am looking forward to her services. I'd bring my 4 year old with me since I do not have a sitter. Ann would put on a TV show for her on Netflix by the front desk to keep her occupied. They have boxes full of goodies/toys for children. The office is very clean and again the staff are professional, accommodating and personal. The have 2 great payment programs. One is Simple Pay and the other care credit. Dr. Loud also works with children. I'm so glad I found this place.

I was invited to a friend's celebration here. Majority of the customers there were Eastern Europeans, so this will be an unbiased review from a fellow Asian. It is beautiful inside in contrast to its surroundings. The saying "Don't judge a book by its cover" applies here. The inside has a classic, but lavish feel from its interior to decor. There is a bar section with a large TV screen. The place also plays Balkan music. Speaking of music, sometimes this place turns into a concert venue (thought it doesn't look like because I thought the space was a little too tight for performance and audience). Plenty of space for parking and the inside of the cafe seems very clean.  Now to the food.... I didn't order anything because the food were ordered ahead of time for us. Family style sharing of kupus  (Yugoslavian shredded cabbage salad, which is delicious), bread, cevapi (Balkan version of sausage), spicy sausage, schnitzel with cheese and pork, fresh potato fries, some kebobs and veggies. The cevapi was delicious. Was not dry at all and full of flavor. I didn't try the kebobs because the buttons on my jeans were about to break after I ate everything else LOL jk. I wish I did though. The fries were delicious, not your typical American fries. I had ice coffee topped with whip cream. Yummy! I believe they have some specials as well.  Overall satisfied with the place. I believe the guy that was serving us is one of the owners, but whomever he was, he seemed very accommodating. I can't fully give 5 star yet because I haven't experienced the "night life" part of the cafe. When I do though, I will edit this review. However, I do recommend this place for hanging out or having a big party.
