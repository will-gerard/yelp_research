I love working with these guys! As the owner of a pool service company I love having these guys on my team. Anything we need to help service our customers they can provide.   Ed is so friendly and always willing to drop what he is doing to help. Kenny has an answer for everything, he seriously knows pools more than any guy I know. Darryl is great in the field, he provides excellent knowledge and expertise on repairs. The motor shop guys are great as well. They are always eager to help.   If you are looking for a pool supply store, don't go to a generic chain store, come to the best pool supply store in AZ. The Swimming Pool Warehouse will provide you with quality service and knowledge. They have everything you need and even test your water for free! They also provide honest and fair prices which I can't say for a lot of other places in the pool business.   You will not be disappointed!   Thanks for all you do guys!!!

Love this place! They have the best yogurt in town and the best customer service. The place is always busy, but the staff handles it very well. I recommend this place to all my friends and family!

Went here for the first time last week. Our experience was horrible. Drinks were not mixed right. They were out of some ingredients, and the food was just bland. The waitress forgot things and was not very polite. I had high expectations, but was definitely let down. We will not be going back anytime soon.

I had a consultation with Dean. He was very professional and easy to work with. Very knowledgable and an honest man. I will definitely use Brown Roofing for my future roofing needs!
