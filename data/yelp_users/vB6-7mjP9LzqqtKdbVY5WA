finally went. My mother was craving a chili dog while we were out one day so we decided to go for lunch. I wish that I enjoyed it as much as most other people seem to.   Food wasn't what I thought that it would be. I thought that the hot dogs were okay, nothing special and not worth the price---I've had better from the grocery store and cooked on the grill at home.  My mother didn't like the chili and I didn't care for the sauerkraut that I had on my bratwurst. The onion rings were decent though.  The decor is cute and makes you feel like you've been pulled back in time and out East. Now this is where the big problem starts...  The service is just horrible. I encountered four different people working there and only one smiled, another asked me what I wanted and then snapped at me for "ordering incorrectly" (like I know how you're "supposed" to order at a place that I've never been to?)  and the last girl was breaking all kinds of health code violations. Seeing her play with her hair and drinking her personal drinks with her GLOVES ON and then touching food disgusted me. Maybe that played a role in why I didn't think the food tasted that great...because of the people who were handling it. I threw out most of my food, honestly.  I'm usually willing to give a place a second chance if I have an off first visit but I honestly don't ever see myself going back to Ted's. Gross.

This place has definitely changed for the better! I had visited here a while back and remember the food as being mediocre and the decor was just horrible and cheap. Today I called for take out for the first time in quite a while. When I walked in I was shocked, there's a new name and the whole restaurant has been completely redone! It looks wonderful! The staff is very friendly, they kept thanking me for calling and telling me they hope that I would enjoy the food. When he told me my total for two lunch specials, and egg drop soup, and some fried wontons, I was shocked! Only $12?!  With this in mind, I was still expecting the same mediocre food....it was WONDERFUL! The egg rolls were nice and crispy, the sweet and sour sauce tasted great, and most of all the chicken lo mein was to die for. It had plenty of vegetables in it and even water crescents which I feel like are left out of a lot of dishes these days! I was really impressed by the service and the food. I'll definitely not take so long to come back this time around.  The new management has helped this place quite a bit. I've tried just about every Chinese place in Tempe and this is definitely my winner.

I'm all about good beer on tap so I love stopping by different breweries in the area. I finally got over to Four Peaks to catch up with a friend and have been wanting to go back since! Good food, good beer, great music, awesome service. The only downside is that the parking sucks---we parked quite walk down the street because there was nothing close available (and this was a Wednesday afternoon). That being said, park far away and burn off of those extra calories so you don't feel guilty about all of those beers that you're about to drink (:

I just recently moved to Tempe about a month or so ago and was immediately on the search for a new sandwich place (considering my favorite from my old city was only located there). I had heard a lot about places like Jimmy Johns, and have both a Subway and Cheba Hut right next to my place, and I tried just about everything before I got to Silver Mine---I wish I would have tried them first! Their subs are REALLY good. My two favorites are Dodge City and Cripple Creek. They are really easy to order from, as you can go into the store, call them, or even order online for pickup or delivery. I usually have them deliver and they're always super quick---usually 15-20 minutes tops when they give you the estimate time of 30 minutes. Not only that, but they deliver until 3 AM which is perfect for Tempe considering it's a generally young crowd who are up late and partying and get those late night munchies.  They are a little pricier than some other places but they always have coupons and deals for you while most other places don't offer this. Even with slightly higher prices, I think they're totally worth it. I'm a 100% Silver Mine fan now. Keep up the good work!

I recently moved from Surprise out to Tempe about a month ago. I live literally right across the street from Cheba Hut and was so excited because there was one across the street from my old college, it's a frequent hangout for college kids. The food is decent but I think the atmosphere and theme of the place is really what attracts people. I mean come on, how many weed themed places have you seen?! Haha However, since moving to Tempe and discovering a good dozen other sub places, I usually would try something else these days (huge Silver Mine Subs fan!) but all in all, Cheba Hut is decent and worth a shot if you've never been there (: Go get some "toasted" subs! haha

When I lived in the west valley I would go to the Pita Jungle in Peoria every chance I had, it's a 5-star all time favorite place. When I moved to Tempe I was really excited to be by a Pita Jungle. The food is awesome and has great options for everyone including vegetarians and children. The atmosphere is really cool although the small parking lot is ridiculous to get into/find a space. The food is five star-but the service I've had at this particular location has honestly.....sucked. I've been to this location twice and even though I love Pita Jungle, I don't really plan on going back to often and haven't in quite some time unless it's a different location.

Oregano's is a great place, definitely my top choice for pizza! They have toppings and combinations you've never even thought of plus. I'm not a fan of their deep dish pizza but their thing crust is to die for! Everything else I've had their I have loved. Cool atmosphere and great service, but do prepare to wait!

Whenever I got to Casey's, I usually sit at the bar. The bartenders are always nice and they usually have some good beer selections. I've never had anything that I didn't like as per food from here. Someone got me hooked on the blackened shrimp tacos and I will never be the same!   Side note: If you go in the afternoon, you'll be sure to see some dogs hanging out on the patio (: It's awesome. Woof woooof!

This place was so neat! The patio was lovely with nice lighting and a live musician, very relaxing! It would be a great place for a date with the dim lighting and the nice, long wine list. I went with a friend and and the food was wonderful. We had the shrimp bisque to start and my friend ordered a bowl so I could try some but the waitress surprised us and split the bowl in two so we each had our own, I thought that was thoughtful (: The voodoo penne was good and if you're a fan of lots of peppers and tomatoes then it would be  good choice. What I will say is that this place is pricey, it was over $30 a piece before tipping which I think is about double a lot of places prices for similar dishes. The presentation and preparation of the food was fabulous though, you can tell that they care about how the food looks! I would go back but not too often, it'd hurt the pocket book too much :P

This is probably my favorite place in Tempe. I would eat a pasty from this place every day, no joke. They have a wide variety of pasties from more traditional ones like Shepherds Pie or Bangers & Mash (my two favorites besides the Cajun Chicken) to The Mexican or Chicken Alfredo. I usually get a pasty, some oven chips, and a Strongbow (which they almost always have on tap). This has been a favorite place for my group of friends to meet and catch up at for years now. I've never once had a bad experience at this place. Plus, great music! (;

I don't know why so many people give bad reviews to Chen Wok. It's one of my favorite chinese places in Surprise and has been for years. They have a large variety of food and huge portions! I have literally never been disappointed with my order from here. Plus, they deliver. Who doesn't love that?

Chompie's is pretty awesome. They have a great menu with mile high sandwiches! Everything I've eaten from there has been great and the service has always been awesome as well. I love all of the pastries that they have, I had been looking for some decent cannoli's in Tempe for a while when I stumbled across this place. Definitely a great place to go for a sandwich or breakfast.

Absolutely my favorite chinese place in all of Surprise and more than likely out of any place I have tried throughout my life. Every dish I have ever ordered has been fabulous. The people who own/work here are very sweet. The location itself is somewhat small inside but also offers outside patio dining. While I have dined in on occasion, I prefer takeout to get my chinese fix! The orange chicken is literally my all time favorite dish!

I always hate when you go to a place that's been hyped up just to end up generally disappointed. The pizza wasn't bad---it just wasn't anything too special like I expected. They have a lot of options for toppings which is cool, as well as some interesting appetizers. I did like their crust, it was crispy on the outside but nice and fluffy on the inside. Really, it just reminded me of pizza I've had a million times though...better than your huge chains like Pizza Hut and Papa John's and probably on the same level as places like NYPD and Streets of New York. So, it wasn't bad. I will tell you that the pizza warms up horribly though in the microwave! A large (16 inch) pizza is about 25 friggin' bucks so I want to eat all of it, leftovers included, but the crust cooks too much and becomes hard while your toppings are still cold. So, you either enjoy the crust and not the rest of the slice OR enjoy the majority of the pizza and not the crust which you actually enjoyed. Service isn't that great, I feel like this is a trend on Mill. They do seem to have a lot of options as per beers and whatnot, I'd expect they'd be a cool place to go for happy hour.   So, overall I won't be trying them again. If I wanna pay a lot of money for a pizza I'll go a block over to Oregano's where the pizza is cheaper, bigger, and more enjoyable in my opinion. I really was hoping for more from this place.

I was definitely expecting something a little different. It really isn't reminiscent of "pub" at all and once I saw the menu with minimal pub fare on it, I just had to move past that idea and look at it from a different perspective. The hostess was rude, but our server was absolutely amazing. He joked, had a constant smile, and always could tell when our drinks needed refilled. 5 stars for him. I got a chicken caprese sandwich, sounds good right? It wasn't as good as I thought. The thick mozzarella on it was cold while the rest of the sandwich was hot which made the bread extremely soggy. I only ate a small portion of it. The fries on the side were great though, nice and crisp! I've heard their burgers are really enjoyable. I would go back and try something different, such as a burger, but from my first experience their we both agreed it wasn't that great.

I absolutely love this place from the awesome decor and menu (inspired by artists such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and The Rolling Stones) to the delicious food and beverages this place rocks (quite literally). There's always good music playing and great service as well. They're always willing to answer any questions you have about the menu or give you suggestions of things to try and everything I've tried I've ended up liking. This is a great place to hang out with your friends or being in the ASU area it is also a great and different environment to grab a cup of coffee and study (: Everyone that I've brought to Metro so far has loved it, and I'm sure the people that I bring in the future will as well. It's such a nice escape from the corporate coffee companies that have all but taken over Tempe. Thanks for giving us somewhere more interesting to hang out at! Keep it up guys!
