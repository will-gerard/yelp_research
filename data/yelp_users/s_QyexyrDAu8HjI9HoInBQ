I love this place! I can always find a full outfit here (often designer) right down to the shoes and handbag in one day and pretty quickly too.  And the prices are so cheap. I spent $300.00 and came home with a full Spring wardrobe.  If I did that anywhere else, I would be lucky to get just one outfit! And would have spent a week trying to find it all.  This place is the best and beats walking around the Mall for the entire day bouncing from store to store to try to put an outfit together.   It is clean and organized well and their home goods section is a pretty decent size. I have never gotten anything poorly made either.   So far so good. I love Ross!  I have been to others and so far this is the better one in my opinion.

Took my car to this "hand wash" car wash and the 2nd time I used them, the paint on my newer Lexus is coming off now. The clear coat has been taken off some how. It is very dull and scratchy now! Maybe the chemical cleaners, maybe scrubbed off, maybe improperly waxed; maybe the water is too hard here? IDK? The inside has been scratched up too. My dash and the plastic cover over the gauges are all scratched up.   They are VERY heavy handed to say the least - and it sure seems very careless - even intentional!?!  They ruined my paint and interior.  It is very bad, and I now have to get my car painted!  I really cannot believe it. I won't ever take my car here again. And I am considering holding them responsible for the damage - just don't really know how to do that.  Look at all the bad reviews of Arizona Auto Wash in Scottsdale! I wish I would have read this first on Yelp, but I would have never guessed they would cause damage to my paint and interior.

So far they are accommodating and very nice.   I was in yesterday to get make up but they were out of stock. The girl behind the register said that a shipment comes in every Thursday (for my make up) and to call so they can hold the items I wanted. I did just that and they made it easy, breezy to get in and out with everything I needed.

I'm excited about this Y. It is pretty much the same as all the other Y's, but that is what is great. It is more private, personalized and cozy (if that makes any sense). I love to work out and they have everything I need - nothing too fancy - just your basic - get down to business fitness equipment. And then there's the classes and pool and so much more than the "showy" gyms. Plus, the people are friendly, and I get a family type of vibe here. And there's no one walking around with there ass crack pinched up in a thong! It is classy and pleasant. I just love it here and look forward to my workouts as a result. It really should get five stars, but I haven't tried the classes to see if the instructors are any good yet (so I will update:)

I had a really rude experience today at Sprouts in Scottsdale.   I have been coming here to get organic beef for a while now. They were out of organic roasts so I asked the guy working in the meat department if he was going to be putting any roasts out soon.  He got noticeably upset and stormed out from behind the counter and started grabbing and tossing aside packages of beef until he found one that said organic chuck - but it was a very, very small slice (a chuck steak) and the only one there. I needed a roast.   I told him I needed a bigger one. He said you will never get a bigger one here - we don't have them. I said, "really, I just got several last week and I remember one of them being at least 3 - 5 times bigger than that one."  He said, "so you got a roast that was about 38.00 from here." I said,"no, but I did get a roast that was. 2.79 lbs." which was much bigger (by about 3Xs) than the steak he was trying to force me to buy.  This guy was nasty and very argumentative. I only wanted a roast. So he got really sarcastic and went into the back and brought out a wrapped up roast that was the size of a calf and said to me... then you want this!  Well, one, I thought he did not have anymore roast and certainly not big ones from what he was saying. And, two, no I obviously don't want half of a cow - just a normal roast.  Is that really too much to ask.  So, I thanked him and asked to have one cut into 3 lbs. He said sure. When I came back to get it it was still crazy large weighing almost 5 lbs. I couldn't even fit that into a pot if I tried.  His attitude was really uncalled for... very argumentative and nasty. Very unprofessional. I thought Sprout's accommodated your butcher requests. This guy (a very young and cocky kid) makes it like you are insulting him.  I guess he just did not want to do any work and cut up a roast. That is a chore... but it's your job genius.Just do it right.  I took the roast, but on walking away to the register, I decided not to get it. I really could not trust a very poor attitude like that. For all I know he could have substituted it with a non organic or lesser quality meat.     I should have gotten his name. He was the youngest one there and walking around very proud-like with a bit of a red face.  Sprouts, you really need to do something about this guy. He will definitely scare business away. As it stands, I am VERY reluctant to purchase beef from your department now.  On a side note, this place is not as nice as the other Sprout's. It is small, dirty/smelly, and they do not carry as big of a selection. And, the organic section is full of mostly old and rotting produce. I never get organic produce here, and now I am not so sure about the organic meats either:-(

Trader Joe's is so much better than Whole Foods in every way.   Their prices are unbeatable. And the quality is outstanding, so much better than Whole Foods!  They have a fair selection of Organic food & products (that are affordable), and their packaged Trader Joe's label products are non-GMO. Plus, they have a great selection of fish and they have independent testing done to see if it meets their standards for no mercury, no antibiotics, crowding and etc (but I think that is only for certain selections of fish). They have very responsible products and minimal ingredients without all the chemicals and by-products.Check out the website for more info on it.  Every time I need something and think WFs will have it - being that they are so big - they don't; and I find it at Tjs every time - even though they are smaller!  I do wish you would start carrying a larger selection though; And I wish you had courtesy ice.

Stop spraying your fresh loaf breads with BUG SPRAY.  Yes, I am a fan of TJ's. The quality and price just cannot be beaten, but lately they are falling waaaaay short.  I used to love their fresh loaves of bread until I kept getting them doused with bug spray. I had this happen 4 times - so beware. I WILL NOT BUY IT AGAIN!  Also there organic cream is very old lasting only a week according to the expiration date and so far it has gone bad on me 2 times before that date.  And... I purchased organic chicken breast that was bad too.  So there quality and care seem to be going down a bit at this location.

This place is in a great location - next to the Boulders and all of the beautiful scenery. The mountains up here are gorgeous and worth the drive alone. But top that off with great food (especially the salads!) and great service well that just makes a night out (and go at twilight!) to die for. It is fairly easy to get to - just straight down Scottsdale Rd. And you can do some shopping around here too. I am impressed but a lot of things are impressing me about AZ. This is definitely one spot to check out.

I am here visiting my sister in AZ. She has been very ill and trying desperately to get medical intervention. She has seen a number of doctors - all whom were of very little help.  This one - though - takes the cake!!! Yet, she is typical. If you are looking for an intelligent doctor who can think, move on. Dr. Mirella Mircescu is limited.   It is so difficult for sick people to get real help, and it is so sad to watch. We have not been able to find a good doctor yet. If we do, you can be sure I will post it everywhere I can. No wonder the people in the United States have such poor health. So many of our healthcare providers just are not very intelligent, they can't diagnose people and are really in medicine for all the wrong reasons (money).  Well, that is my rant! I feel so helpless. Some doctors are really bad in Arizona and here in FL.
