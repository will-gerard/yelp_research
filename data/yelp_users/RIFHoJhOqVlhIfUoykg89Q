I used to eat here all the time. It's been a hot minute. Today having lunch at their once great lunch buffet was horrid. The rice was dry and crunchy. The food was of poor quality. The tomato chicken tasted like beef jerky . On top of all that the services was horrid. I had to actually get up from the table and walk over to the bar were there was 5 waiters standing around and talking to ask for a refill of soda. They acted like it was such a bother and barely said two words to us. Never going back again

Can't believe they sell nazi items here.  Will never be back as well as their customer service and knowledge was  very poor.

This is one of my favorite places in the valley to eat. Hands down some of the best Korean BBQ anywhere and I have traveled all over and had lots. Their sides are amazing and they are very very generous with them. I would recommend the short ribs marinated as my personal fav. Remember if you get a meat not marinated first that is what you are getting just plain meat. Everything is good and the services is great and if you come back they will remember you.

Great selection...must be over 150 antique vendors in this Marketplace. We spent hours going up and down all the aisles searching for treasures. Was tons of fun, and will definitely go back again in the near future!

This place is such a hit or miss. I try to go here just to support local business but some days I walk in there and get great customer service and some days I don't. It's really upsetting because my dog eats special food. So when some cashier is being snotty with me telling me I need to call days and days ahead to make sure they get the food when I'm explaining I've never come in and it not be here, and her just brush me off is disconcerting. But I'm constantly going in for stuff and having to come back because they don't have it. The staff is sub par to say the least and I feel I know way more about all their brands then they do. I regret to say it but I'll have to go elsewhere even if that means driving far.

This place is awesome....best Pho I have found in the Valley. Very affordable....treated 3 of my friends to lunch here recently...we ordered appetizers(try the Fake Pork rolls) main courses, and drinks...and the grand total for 4 people was only $34!! This place is hidden gem.

Burnt pizza .. 45 min wait for food that was bland and mediocre.  On top of that they said the special was a shrimp pasta but really it was a regular dish with 3 shimp's that they added 5 bucks to my bill for. It was supposed to have truffle oil but instead I got a bowl of pasta drenched in olive oil and water.  I can't believe I paid for this I was just happy to get out of here.  The service was slow and food wasn't worth the wait.

Brandon at Doggie in the Window is hands down the best groomer I have ever met!! He goes above and beyond. You can tell from the moment you meet him that his calm and confident personality rubs off on the pets he grooms. He takes his time and gets to know each one. He does a phenomenal job! Because of Brandon my dogs actually get excited and look forward to going to the groomer. If your dog needs to be groomed definitely take them to Doggie in the Window.

Service was great. Food was below par and not worth the price at all. Really there was a major lack of flavor and originality.

Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.

The food here was good. They had kabobs which in my book are always a plus. If your looking for decor give this place a pass but I got the feeling it was a family business and are just getting it off the ground. It looks like they have alot of the old buffets equipment left and put in a few items of their own. I'm a fan I think its great to see a buffet this side of town that offers more then just a lunch. A few of the dishes were cold but overall everything looked fresh and tasted good. They also give you pita at the table and had a large variety of hummus dishes.

Wow, what a waste. So after waiting half an hour for our appetizers which one was chips and salsa we waited another half hour for food which we were told would be up shortly. We needed to go as we had somewhere to be and the rate it was going it felt like it would be another half hour before we saw our actual meal. I would think they would comp our appetizers for the inconvenience but no sure enough they brought us a bill. Lame bad start. The appetizers were mediocre at best. The guy said to give them a break because it was their 6th day open. They had at least 4 servers and 3 bussers, was their only one cook in the back? I didn't know it took 30 minutes to arrange chips on a plate! I would give this place a second chance, I will wait until they are on their 30th day open and maybe by then they will have figured a few things out about service.
