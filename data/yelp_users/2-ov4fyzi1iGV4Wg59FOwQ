If you are purchasing a car seat, breast pump or stroller from Babies R Us beware... the warranty they sell eliminates these items from the "gift card no hassle refund"  I purchased a warranty on a stroller from Babies R Us last year after the cashier convinced me that if anything happened to the stroller Babies R Us would send me a gift card to be able to purchase a new one and that I would not have to deal with the manufacturer warranty.    When I tried to file a claim the system kept kicking me out. Then customer service at Babies R Us tells me I have to go to the store and purchase a new one then send both receipts (the one for the old one and the new one to them) then they would reimburse for the new one, but only after the manufacture warranty expires. What a pain. Who wants to do all that. They get to collect an extra $20 from people and get away with this supposed added convenience that is actually just a scam.  I will never set foot in a Babies R Us / Toys R Us again. The nerve of big business to steal $20 from the working class.

Lifetime is doing a lot for the kids now which I really appreciate.  I almost left the gym after kids activities and child care times started getting cut last year, but the new kids schedule is pretty amazing.  I'm glad this gym is so family friendly.   I attend the group fitness classes in the afternoon and evening. The instructors are awesome!

Sometimes the service isn't so great and the food is burnt now and then, but overall this is a great breakfast place.  Hoosier Cafe has been around forever and has enough cliental to not really need you to try them out. The food is delicious!

The people in the pharmacy here are pretty rude but other than that I love this Costco. I've been shopping at this Costco for a couple of years and it's always a good experience.  Bit of advice: Don't go to Costco without a list or you'll leave with way more than you need!
