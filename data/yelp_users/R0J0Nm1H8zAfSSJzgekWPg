Just a quick trip from Arcadia or Biltimore area  and you are eating Salvadorian cuisine. Reasonably priced, and large portions, with extras like a little bowl of chicken noodle soup to start you off.   Had a chance to speak with the owner and he gave us some background on the place and his daughters name is Eliana. It saddens me to go into a place like this at 7pm and not see it packed, when any given Fox Restaurant has a wait out the door. (Really PHX?)   Either way, go support this restaurant and your stomach. You will enjoy the food and atmosphere. Also the owner has come to our table everytime we have eaten there and said hi while  personally asking if everything is OK.  There is a dish with chicken and sour cream that has the word Favorito in the name, that is my fiancee's favorite.   Oh yah. And get down with some Papusas. You want be sorry.

These guys know whats up. Took the time to tell me about some tire problems that I had, and even asked me if I drive the car 'aggressively' as they would have set it up a bit different. Not many places left that actually seem like specialist of a trade. Will be going back for sure!

OK Quick tip food service industry. If you are a smoker and bringing me my food, it is not only appreciated, but absolutely necessary that you defunk after your smoke sucking out back by the grease trap. I get it, brining me my bread is stressful, and you need your nicotine while you bitch to your coworker how I am only drinking water. However this literally makes me sick and sets an overall bad town for the entire meal.   Not only that... But this place is 30 years old... They hired servers once and they have all been working there since.   Not that they were not kind, or attentive. Those parts were there, just a very old school approach.   As far as the food goes, nothing was that impressive either. We ordered the antipasto for two which was a selection of cured pork, olives, peppers, a caprese etc. The tomatoes tasted like they got them out of the dumpster at Wendy's and the meat was sliced a bit to think for the fat content.   On to the entrees, I got a red sauce, seafood dish, the diablo I believe, which was supposed to be spicy, it's spice factor was on par with Taco Bell's medium sauce. Also, they didn't clean the shrimp. I understand in the cafes of Paris (Say it like par-ee) they will serve head on shrimp that are fantastic, however 40th street and Indian School is a far way off from the Mediterranean. Also the calamari was excessively chewy, the muscles and clams were small and dry. However the fettucini was cooked very well and was actually pretty tasty. The dish was honestly Fazoli's quality on a good day.   My Fiancee got the chicken piccata and while I thought it was not to bad, she said she has had better in the middle seat of a Delta flight from New York.   The waiters presentation of the aged desert platter was tempting, however after our shitty food, we were over it.   Stay classy Arcadia.

What a joke. I took my girlfriends car to this place because of some tire issues that we were having on her car. There was an obvious object stuck in the tire and their was obvious separation. Drove their on a Saturday, the guy working said they couldn't do anything so sent me home. Driving home, that is...Also my tire pressure light was still on after they said they filled up the tire...  Oh and the only reason I even came to this place was she had purchased the tires here a year before and also bought the worthless warranty.   Anyways, dropped the car off the next day at the scheduled time. Sat in the waiting room that claimed to have free Wi-fi that didn't work. Anyways after an hour and a half of waiting, the manager I believe comes in and tells me exactly what he told me the day before, except now he says I need new struts.   He said he didn't have the tires we needed and he would call me the next business day.  Well that day has passed and even with the warranty from Goodyear, we ended up going to Discount.   They took care of us in a professional manner.  What a waste of time. Don't go here.

Meh. Your BMW driving cliental doesn't impress me. Here is the deal, when I go out to eat I expect to be treated like a guest, not a potential tip. I think this is how it is supposed to be, am I right?   Either way, my fiancee had just graduated Pharmacy school and was owed a dinner from her wonderful father in law to-be and she chose Chelsea's Kitchen. When we were seated, a server immediately came and took our drink order, which was nice... After that another person came by with the drinks, and then finally our server. Our server was a late 20' something that looked less than thrilled to see our water drinking selves.   Anyways, ordered the Guacamole: $10   not that it was bad or anything, but when we ran out of chips it took five minutes for the server to get to our table and an additional five mins to get the chips. Not super busy either...   After this it was more of the same. I got the short ribs, which were supposed to be a specialty item. Now they were not bad, but I have had much and made much better. And they seemed a little dry.   My dad and brother got tacos that were good, but they ran out of tortillas and it took 10 minutes to get new ones.  The lady got fried chicken and it was a little dry,with grilled broccoli which was not received well by the Pharmacist. Anyways, my point is this....The server didn't see us as a phat tip and it showed via her lack of service. Over all food was ok, but the server ruined it.

Im sure this place is better... however per circumstance I have to rate it poorly.  We showed up about 8:15 dodging construction and Glendale night walking folk to a fairly empty restaurant. Waited to be seated for 5 minutes and grabbed a couple menus to pass the time... Anyways, first thing the bearded, long haired, and very german waiter has to say to me is that the kitchen is closed. The hours stated they were open till 9. Either way, the onion soup could have been good if it was hot, as well as my knockwurst. My fiance got the chicken schnitzel and it was pretty good. I have worked in the industry and would have rather had them tell me to come back another time than recieve half ass food and service.

Sent me home with a chicken meal instead of the vegetarian one I ordered and I didn't notice until I got home. Couldn't eat it and it was like 118 degrees outside so I decided to not go back.   Called and let them know about this and the girl I talked to apologized and expressed her sympathy for me and told me that a manager would call me back to take care of this...  Never happened.  Seriously can't stand when people or businesses say they are going to do something but don't. The food is not awful, but this is a part of the "Service Industry" not the we forgot about you after we effed up your order industry.   won't be back.

ehh, came in here to get a coffee and the condescending tattooed waitress just ruined the whole trip for my fiancee and I. The display looked great, and to judge a place without actually eating there is not my style. However, customer service is very important, and not only was she rude, but also kind of insulting. Personally I would not go back. Scratch this off my list...

I really dislike giving bad reviews, especially to an establishment owned and operated by someone as sweet as Aurora, unfortunately the staff does not have the same passion as her. Our food also was nothing extraordinary.  It had potential, however "meh, I've experienced better"  First off, we sat for 10 minutes without a waitress coming to our table. Finally when we did get seen by Jennifer, it was quite the underwhelming experience. We ordered Mac and Cheese minus the pork, the duck leg and eggplant parmigiana.   Oh and to start, we got a bruschetta, and also the olive selection.  On the plus side, the potatoes where on a bed of greens with a roasted potato and date vinaigrette. The duck was a very modest portion and a bit over cooked. The mac and cheese, was nothing special, and the eggplant parmigiana was undercooked to the point where the puff pastry still had a raw dough taste in the middle.   The space is nice, and funny enough the older gentlemen sitting next to me said "don't get the steak special" when I sat down with his wife quickly chiming in stating his name in disbelief. I dunno, a restaurant where you pay $65 bucks for two to eat with no drinks, should be a bit of an experience. The servers should be professional, put together and at your table within a couple minutes to take your drink order and go over specials. I cook, and I eat. When I don't want to cook, I expect people to be on point.... and this was not.

Through high school (which I rarely attended) I got a job as the night manager at Haagen Dazs in the Biltmore. This has forever ruined my experience with the majority of ice cream joints. On Christmas eve, I had a hankering for some ice cream. (a hankering, really Tony? what are you 75?) anyways... my Dad happened to have a Groupon for Sweet Republic so we checked it out.  Being the glutton I am, I ordered the flagship Sundae. With three scoops, multiple toppings, whip cream etc etc. The ingredients are all fresh. From the homemade ice cream, to the freshly whipped cream. The caramel I believe is made by a man named Jesus, who lives in the middle east some wheres...   The ice cream is fantastic. The owner is knowledgeable and walking the talk as far as local and organic. Also the product is able to stand up to my overly critical ice cream palate. I am an ice cream freak, and this place is FREAKIN GREAT!

Imagine you are hungry, really hungry.  Then imagine you are not really someone that eats meat. Then imagine there is a vegetarian restaurant right by your house that is reviewed well.   Then fast forward to the point were you visit the restaurant and imagine the waitress to be acting preoccupied and treating you like you are inconveniencing her yogi swag.  Then imagine that the food was only OK at best. Then imagine that there were 8 employees there and you had to wait a considerable time for refills and extras.  Well you just imagined my experience at Chakra. Attitude goes a long way with me... And their vegetarian elitist attitude is hardly inviting or hospitable. There was an older lady there that was very kind, however the other employees were just abrasive. Won't be back.

Now a days you would be hard pressed to find a decent meal for $5 that was actually edible. While fast food joints continue to feed the nation processed garbage Two Hippies stands out from the crowd with their large portions, organic veggies, and fresh natural meats.   On top of that, the staff has been nothing but helpful, friendly and really makes you feel like family. Brandon actually takes the time to make sure my tacos are made correctly on a daily basis. If it is Monday through Friday, you can usually catch me here. Also as far as vegetarian options go, the black bean taco or burrito with rice is probably my favorite. The daily specials are a hit as well.  Can't lose with Two Hippies! Much love guys!   Tony

Would like to also point out that the owner just tried to bash me personally after his employees did.  I am not the type to promote negativity in any sense at all... however when he is trying to publicly say that I had a credit card denied, just shows the lack of class on his part, and the organization he represents. Just because your property is in the heart of old town, and you have a weekend pool party with a dj, does not make your "resort" anything more than a poorly ran business. The staff I encountered seemed miserable, and unapologetic of the inconvenience they caused me by ill informing me on the phone when booking the appointments. Not to mention, the staff reminded me of flash backs of bad DMV experiences. This place is awful. The property is beautiful and its a shame that such shallow, selfish and overall negative employees ruin the whole place. Was engaged the day before and looking at wedding spots... hmmm. might wanna put your best face forward regardless guys. YOU NEVER KNOW. With that I am gonna tell you, dont waste your money as The Valley HO.

Just go eat here. Get the cheese curds, I think they may be developing CCA (cheese curd anonymous) soon, but until it becomes a diagnosable disease I will continue to indulge.  Oh yah, the Pine Steak, is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies.   Oh, oh, oh...  the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in Phoenix.   Just do yourself a favor and go check this place out. And try the home made ginger ale, tonic or lemonade by them selves... or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits.

A few bucks more than your fast food Mexican chain restaurants, but well worth the price. Right next to my office and has quickly become a favorite. I get the machaca (shredded) beef burritos or tacos, and it is always so hot I have to wait a few minutes to eat it. A+ Headed there now!

I eat here at least once a week. The staff is friendly and accommodating to my request! They have vegetarian and vegan options as well.   I would really recommend the Chana Massala as well as the eggplant. I order those dishes with the fresh made Naan and it can feed both myself and my gf for a nice dinner.   They are currently updating the look and feel of the restaurant and store. I usually just get togo from there, but sometime may dine in. More of a togo place for me though...  But look forward to seeing their updates! Good lunch falafel lunch wrap too :D

When im in Central Phoenix and looking for a pick me up that won't land me in jail, Urban Beans is the only place I get my iced coffee from. I guess it is slow brewed for 12 hours, and honestly you can taste the difference.  Also they support many local business's as well as purchase locally roasted beans. Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. Great patio seating area right off 7th street and also a spacious interior, to work, study, meet, or just have a cup of your favorite beverage.   They also have a great little market area with tons of cool local companies products on display. Check it out, and stay away from that green place. Put your money someplace that actually cares!

Cheap and authentic tasting. Fresh meat and veggies. I like the feeling in the place with the elderly woman cooking in the back that seems to come out to see if we enjoyed our food. Don't ever order anything EXTRA SPICY unless you are looking for a cleansing effect.

Had the pleasure of getting my haircut today by Amber the salon owner. Not only was she attentive to all of my request, but she also seems to really be walking the talk when it comes to being "green."   While she was snipping away at my mistreated locks we had a chance to talk backyard chickens, vegetable gardens and the apathy of society when it comes to consuming. It is refreshing to find like minded individuals in any industry, but especially so when it is your hairdresser. Would definitely recommend you go your hair did at this spot.   Decor is awesome, with stained  concrete floors and a local artists offering. Plenty of little touches as well! Music was unique but not offensive. I am a happy man. I will be sending people your guys way!  Thanks for the awesome haircut!

So ran across one of the owners Joseph passing out flyers for this place right before opening and was intrigued by the menus simplicity and price point. This morning (1 pm) after a long night at some local dance and drink spots we made a point to go check this place out. Pleasantly pleased. Home cooked food with a comfortable new and hip feel to it. Break the chain habit and go eat here. I got the chicken and tried the pork and its as good as I make. YUMMM

Took our kitties here after their perverse actions led me to believe that removing their man hood would be a good idea. My wonderful fiancee did all the foot work and found the best deal for us that was near our house. Dr. Katz and her sister were super friendly and treated the kitties like they were their own pets. The cats still like to whine outside our door at 5am but apparently so do the docs. Great experience overall and we will be coming back for any of our animal needs. THANKS GUYS!! ALSO WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER THAN OTHER VETS WE CALLED!

I drive a Volvo that is almost 20 years old and have been through the ringer with several local shops already.   Russ is the only mechanic I have found in town that actually seems to know what he is talking about. No bs, friendly dude and really honest pricing. Thanks again Russ!

I can't get enough of this place. Just go. It's kind of in the hood, but shit, if you want you can get a $10 fade and fix that bong that has been sitting in your closet in the same parking lot. Besides the fade and bong stem, make sure you get the best $1.50 fish taco of your life.  Amenities are minimal, but if you are not stuck on the glitz and actually enjoy food this is the place to be!

American Fare is dominated by MEAT. I grew up eating meat and still consume other mammals, avians, and our friends in the sea on occasion. However after my recent learnings of the industries that fuel my beloved bacon mushroom cheeseburger I have decided a change is needed!  Personally, I call it an aware-a=tarian.  Anyhow, what I am getting at is that going out to eat, being primarily an eater of plants is like going to a fast food restaurant and asking for a water cup. Never Satisfied!   Instead of being attentive to the fact that you want to eat plants, the vegetarian options are usually a bland house salad with sponge flavored tomatoes, and cabbage that would be better suited as a packing material than food.   This isn't the case at Sol. I am not sure of their vegetable sourcing but everything tasted fresh, and of origin from some type of soil. In addition we had an excellent waiter from Chicago via Croatia, who's name I will refrain from butchering. He was attentive, knowledgable, polite and more than helpful with my friends 17 month old. We were there this Saturday, late morning and there was also a brunch offering.   Sweet potato tacos were yummy, as was the veggie burrito as were the mushroom and poblano tacos. Also, I was talking to the waiter about the vampiro* taco and he brought one of those out as well. Very good stuff. The chips and salsa were fairly boss like too, being made of tostadas with some seasoning on them. Salsas were fresh and unique but not weird.   Only negative about this place was the host that seated us was definitely a bit of a control freak. He didn't appreciate the fact that we wanted to move tables to accommodate my friends baby. I get that we are in North Scottsdale, and you're not catering to 17 month olds, we get it... But babies are made in DC Ranch too Mr  middle aged snobby host, so be nice.   Now I was here on a Saturday morning and it was fairly slow. I could really see this place being capable of being full of more material seeking individuals than myself, but to each their own. With that being said I hardly EVER dine out in the 'Dale, but again this was not an awful experience at all!  Also our server was phenomenal and that makes all the difference. Peace out yelpers.

Sometime I look in Andrews eyes, I don't  a word, and he brings me the perfect craft cocktail. These kinds of occurrences shape me in the human I am today. The human that has an empty iced coffee from 4 weeks ago still in my fridge.

I hate to do this, because I don't want this place to be busy for selfish reasons, however I have an obligation to uphold. It is of no surprise that Vovomeena is anything but fantastic, coming from the flavor dense minds from Tuck Shop and Astor House.  This morning I got their signature Japanese iced coffee and the Espanola which was kind of an egg, potato, spinach and cheese pie with a chunky red sauce that is bursting with flavors.  The decor is sustainable and hip, chairs were comfortable, lighting is good, staff is friendly and personable as well... Can you tell I like the place?

Products and people with integrity... what a concept!!! These girls are doing so many great things that they deserve nothing but success!   I think juicing can get a bad rep sometimes for not being ultra tastey, but kaleidoscope juices are all very well thought out using only organic ingredients! Also their Thai Tiger Salad is amazing!   On top of the products being excellent, they compost all of their waste from the juicing! BIG PLUS!    All in all one of my favorite spots to visit! Staff is very knowledgable, friendly and can help you whether you a seasoned juicer or just trying something new!   Go get a juice, it will make you feel energized!

First time at D'Lisa's new salon and I must say I was impressed with both the building and service. Simple yet effective decorating, a friendly face when I walk in the door that always asks if I want something to drink.   As a man walking into a 'salon' it is almost intimidating. Unfamiliar smells, and women are at their most vulnerable, sporting aluminum foil in their hair pecking away at smart phones like it's there jobs. It is almost like there is no boys aloud type of feeling.   I did not get that vibe at D'Lisa's salon. The atmosphere is fresh, and artsy yes still comfortable. There is always refreshments, and I just got one of the better hair cuts of my life! Vanessa took the time to listen to me gripe about the government, crappy food, valentines day and still managed to get me looking fresh.   These kinds of services are not what I call 'cheap.' So when I spend my money, I want to be happy. And that is exactly what I am after my haircut today. Happy. Thanks guys!

Kaleidoscope's new location is great! Pick up a juice, smoothie, coffee, peanut butter protein cookie or wheat grass shot all from the bike up window. All products are organic, and made with lots of love! The staff is helpful and attentive to your personal needs regardless if you just want a pick me up in the form of juice or coffee, or a life transforming cleanse.   Go try it! It may just change your life...
