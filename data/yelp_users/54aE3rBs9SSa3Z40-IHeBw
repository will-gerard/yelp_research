My husband took our son there after he fell on his hand at home.  His finger was sticking out in a strange direction. After 4 hours and a consultation with both a radiologist and hand specialist (both looked at the Xray, neither saw our son's hand), we were told his fingers were neither dislocated nor broken. We couldn't see a hand specialist for 5 days because of a 3 day weekend, and there we learned that both fingers were broken, one needed to be reset.  Because it had been so long, the reset didn't work very well and surgery was required a week later.  I was very disappointed in the quality of care from Banner Gateway. Our copay was $150. When they determined that our son could eat (b/c he wouldn't need emergency surgery), I asked if they could order some food for him. She told me to just go to the cafeteria.  In our previous experience, they feed kids in the ER when they 've been there for 4 hours.

We were referred to Howard by a friend and have been so impressed. Each time I bring my car in, he tells me the minimum I need to have done (as opposed to the maximum at other places).  The price is always lower than I imagine. Last time, the steering wheel was shaking, I thought there were a lot of problems. Howard test drove my car, drained and refilled the power steering fluid, then told me the real problem was my tires.  He sent me to a tire place and DIDN'T CHARGE ME A A DIME. He is a great guy. (I love that his shirt says "Howard," it's awesome.)

Babbitt Motor Werks is the only place I take my BMWs. The owners, Nathan and Jen, are smart, hard-working people who take great care of me and my cars. They are very competent, providing the best parts and service while always trying to accommodate my schedule by giving me a ride or arranging for a rental.   Is give Babbitt Motor Werks 6 stars if I could and I refer all my friends to them as well.

We went there with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food and drinks were. Definitely will return. Ordered the shriracho burger and lavender lemon fizz. So delicious.
