Worst gel mani of my life. What a Hack job. The lady was really rude. She literally covered my cuticles.  I asked her to fix it and she said oh so sorry too late. WHAT! ? who does that.  No manager or owner on duty.  Will NEVER return. Thanks for wasting my time and money.

Love coming here before heading out to work.  First time I walked in I wasn't sure what to expect. But The owner makes a great cappuccino!  I can't get enough of the apples and walnuts baklava thing (sorry forgot what it's called) the bread is top notch made daily.  Thank you guys for being here!

First time here. If you're looking for reasonable kosher priced dinner this is the place to go. we started off with soups which were delicious. Had the beef pot stickers surprisingly very good. Also  ordered a pesto chicken pasta, teriyaki salmon came with a delicious baked potato and the hubby ordered a schnitzel. All were good.  , best part was the service, Leah she was fast efficient and friendly. If you go there make sure you ask for her.

I think I feel sick after trying to eat this food.  Ewww. Out of desperation we called and ordered food for delivery from this place.  I got the cashew chicken, which I don't even think was  chicken. Some odd substance. Egg drop soup was gross as well.  Ordered side of fried rice which cost extra and I don't think I EVER saw fried rice look that.  Thanks for the most nastiest Dinner ever. I'll go throw up now. ..

Fresh,  Fridley,  and fast delivery!  Thank you for providing this town with delicious  food.  My favorite is the salmon bow tie pasta with marinara sauce and veggies! The salmon is so tender and perfect. The soups are delicious and you can't go wrong with them. Try the pastries they have, always fresh! Everything is reasonably priced too. Thank you La Bella!

Yes!  My new favorite place in cave creek now! Beyond AMAZING food and every bite is so delicious!  Don and Regina have really put their heart and all efforts in providing cave creek with a nice fine dinning experience.  Our server was Ben and he was great and very knowledgeable!  We had the Catalina island salad, wow prefect salad.  The beef skewers very tasty and filed with flavor. Lobster Risotto was my favorite. And we ended it with the apple puff pastry desert. Mmmmmm

I try not to eat doughnuts but  OH MY GOSH....Delicious. Also the coffee is a total hit. I've tried my 4 shot iced espresso and it was perfect.  Also they have this thing called Cafe Du Monde it's a coffee Blend coffee poured condensed milk, you can have it  hot or cold just amazing. The owners are really friendly too.  Thank you Sam and Satia!
