I had my first appt yesterday here. I was lucky enough to have PA Jessica Rosenblum. What a sharp young lady. She was extremely personable, easy to talk to, had excellent answers to my questions. I was very appreciative. The staff runs a tight ship. I barely had time to fill out my paperwork as they called me in exactly at my scheduled time. The young woman who did my intake was really great, fun, really knows how to put a client at ease. I was very impressed with my experience. I appreciate being able to use a PA. Not sure they ever get enough credit, but I know first hand how much schooling they get and know as much as a doc. What they lack, generally, is the arrogance that goes along with many physicians.  I've already recommended her to several of my friends and to my daughter, ALL of whom have NOT had the annual check ups we should all have.   She took off 5 suspicious spots and I left feeling very at ease about my health.  Thanks, Jessica!

Should have gotten to this sooner. Had a tooth "blow up" on me about 2 months ago. Truly the worst pain I have ever felt!  I was rushed to this office and was truly amazed with the speed of which they got to me, got me OUT of pain, and fixed my tooth.  I have used these docs twice before for non-emergency issues. All three experiences have been excellent. Talk about compassion.  My face started swelling on the Sat after the emergency. I called the doc on call. He was at his son's sporting event, doing the announcing, and was ready to bail and come to me immediately. Unreal.  I declined, asked for some suggestions, followed them and did fine. Even so, I received 3 phone calls checking up on me. I would never consider going elsewhere for work.

This is for all Chase banks...not just this one. And it is not regarding the great service, FIVE STAR, I would normally give for how great they have been.  I am very disappointed they have chosen to go almost fully automated. Ive been to two branches in the last 3 days and both have eliminated their drive thru windows, their tellers and only have one teller available.  This lacks the personal touch I've always enjoyed there. I realize this is how the world is going...not happy about it one bit.   If I can find a bank or credit union that will continue with the old fashioned style of real customer service, I will move my business.

WOOOO hoooo! We love our Zipps...not only is it a great place for food, our fav waitress, Kayla is always there. Its worth waiting for her section. She takes such great care of us, knows all of our drinks and food and just starts making our drinks when we walk in. We don't even have to order. She's got us DOWN!!  Only bad part is it would be WAY more fun if she could just join us. We love this place....we've narrowed it down to our only happy hour place. Always great service and food, but Kayla makes it the BEST!

I'm pretty angry with the system this company uses. They are clients of Valley Anesthesiology Consultants. I had surgery last January and was certain all my bills were up to date. Apparently, I was billed (FOUR TIMES) by the anesthesiology but my bills were returned to them because they had copied my address wrong from my physician.  Far be it for them to CALL me to correct the address. Instead, they sent me to COLLECTIONS with this agency.  Arrowhead ALSO did not bother to verify my address. They CLAIM they called my work and were told I was not employed here! No one on my staff would, or DID that! They did not call my cell phone.  They, TOO, send the bill to the WRONG address; a totally different one that the anesthesiologist sent. Thankfully, my mail carrier recognized my name and delivered the bill or I'd never known about it.  Then.. what happens to my credit after that??  Thankfully, I was able to call the anesthesiologists office today and PAY my ENTIRE bill, which is what I would have done immediately upon reception of the bill. When I asked why they hadn't just called me, I was told they are far too big of a company to bother to call clients.   This has been a lot of unnecessary work to correct an error anyone could have fixed by calling my doctor, or me. What an aggravation!

A big shout out THANK YOU to James, #914, for your help today!  Having messed up my bulk trash pick up, placing my items too close to an electrical box... like WAY too close, James stopped by to tell me. Instead of just giving me my notice, he kindly explained the whole process (I've never used it before)...and THEN, he loaded my whole pile into the back of his truck and took it away for me. I know that's not his job, but he really went above and beyond and I'm very grateful!

Just had an hour and half massage with Alecia.  EXCELLENT, great pressure, extremely relaxing...pretty sure I fell asleep. Got this on Groupon for $58!!  This massage is worth FAR more than that. Check it out.  Great place, great environment, and Miss Kayla at the front desk to take your reservation is a sweetheart.

Unbelievably well run shop. They take SUCH great care of their customers. They get me in quickly, and out quickly and always leave me with excellent work and a CLEAN car when I drive out.   I never stick around while they are servicing my car because I need to get back to work; but they make it hard to leave. There is abundant GOOD food, coffee, beverages, comfortable seating, televisions, an enclosed play area for children with great games and movies.  Who wants to waste time getting their car repaired? pretty much no one, but Earnhardt takes the sting out of the time investment with the great atmosphere and top notch customer service. Thanks, Norm!!! You did it again!

One of the best Massage Envy locations. As a newer spa, the management has done an excellent job creating a family culture. The staff at the desk know and greet you when you walk in. The variety of therapists is really good. I have a fav, and I'm not saying who she is because I don't want you all to book her ...so then I couldn't get it. But, there are many there that are great., If you like deep work, there are several who can do trigger point and nail your issues.  I was in yesterday...going back on Friday.

So frustrated with Direct TV.  After a week of battling with over costs they did not disclose up front, I have our new tv set up in an extra bedroom.  I ended up paying $200 MORE than I was told; and all the talking in the world to supervisors lead to nothing more than the buck being passed to the next supervisor of equipment; who was SUPPOSED to call me the next day to make a plan. They never called. When the technician showed up today, he had the exact same equipment order the guy had last week that would not work and knew nothing of the revised order.   The time consuming , waste of time it takes to get THROUGH to a human being to find out what to do is just off the charts.  A COMMUNICATIONS company, one would THINK, would communicate. But once you get past all the recorded nonsense, the people on the other end of the line say "I'm Sorry" a LOT but do nothing to really help. Then, when you DO get a supervisor, they make promises they don't keep.  All of my convos with them are recorded, yet when I asked what was in my notes, the girl on the line today said she could not see them.  ???????  While setting up my equipment, the tech tied my tvs to QUEST for internet. Now, that he's gone and there is nothing I can do to get help, my wireless internet connection is now lost.  My computer tells me to shut down my router for 10 seconds; which we ALL know will then cost me the use on  my TV....ugh!!!  I have marked it on my calendar since I'm locked into a 2 year contract, again....to cancel DIRECT TV on July 27, 2016, and go back to the other bad company, COX.  Both companies are awful. But, they know they have a monopoly on this whole gig and can treat people however they want. Wonder why they demand contracts??? OH!!! Becasue they KNOW we will be unhappy and want to change so they force us to stay or CHARGE us to leave.   You'd think after being a loyal customer for 6 years, never paying a bill late, purchasing a LOT of service including the NFL and NBA tickets, they would provide a little loyalty and a LOT better service.   Sad day at my house.  Mostly aggravated with myself that tv is that important to me.....maybe need to get more of a life!!

Very disappointing that even after a YEAR that I complained about this service, they have never bothered to try to rectify their poor customer service. Still waiting for my contract day to expire and I will change companies.

So, I had forgotten how much this company irritates me. I bought a new tv a few weeks ago and I needed an additional receiver.  Ooops, was supposed to cancel Direct TV and go back to COX...yep, I hate them worse. So I stayed. Sigh, MONOPOLIES. Ugh.  Today I called to order a new receiver and guy was great. He got me all handled and did a great job. Then, he told me I had to talk to ANOTHER person to verify what I had purchased. Ok. So, on the phone comes a  woman who has probably only been speaking English for about 5 hours. I couldn't understand a word she was saying. I heard her say "name" so I was assuming she was asking my name. I asked her if I could please speak with someone else...not sure what she said but she kept talking. I explained that I could not understand her. I can't help but wonder why a communications company will hire someone to COMMUNICATE who does not speak the language. I mean, I could go to Germany and I'll just bet they wouldn't hire me to do phone communications for any company! Finally the line went silent and about 3-4 min later a gentleman came on. Good grief, he was better but he couldn't speak English either. I have no idea what languages either WERE speaking but it wasn't English. Sorry, I'm not bilingual yet.  I kept having to ask him to repeat himself. He wanted me to state that I understood the terms, but I DIDN"T understand the terms because I couldn't understand HIM. So I told him, "No, I don't understand what you're saying...let me restate what I ordered and you can confirm if I am right...you could be telling me I have to give you my first born child...(who is grown and no one wants a grown man)".  But he needed to SAY it to ME...but I couldn't understand him. Come ON, Direct TV...get your act together and make your customer service customer friendly.   I really wish there were more choices for TV providers. I really do.

Fantastic doc. I would highly recommend him to anyone. He did very "tiny' surgery on my finger pinning a bone that had shattered. He's very detailed, very personable, great office staff. This man is one of the best in his field. Its really worth watching his videos if you have issues like carpal tunnel, etc. He is state of the art in this field. Don't risk going somewhere you won't get the excellence this man provides.

This is my NEW FAVORITE place. They have EVERYTHING.  Call Laurie Castillo for the best facial you'll ever have. She can pretty much do anything to make your face look and feel better. I never tell her what I want; I just let her look at my skin and make her expert decision. She also did my permanent eye liner; oh MY!!! How I love it!!! And, today I got my botox there for the first time, and it was fantastic.   This beautiful little hidden away spa is the place to make you feel beautiful and WONDERFUL. ( I even saw a gentleman (tough guy biker) getting pampered, today) Their list of treatments is LONG and thorough and absolutely WONDERFUL.  Check it out!!!  They are not "by appt only" but you'll prob get a better time if you call ahead. Don't miss this gem.

Incredible to find out that my aesthetician is not only fabulous to her clients, but she is also a kind humanitarian who gives back. I shared with her that I had a student with horrible acne that I had been trying to help before he gets to high school. She took him on pro bono!!! Who does that?? He is SUCH a happy camper because she's going to ensure he starts school without the horrifying effects that acne can bring socially. Amazing lady!!!  I've referred several friends to Laurie for facial treatments. Everyone comes out with that same feeling of being pampered, feeling like they are Laurie's favorite person (She has that knack), and their skin feels fantastic. Very proud to refer her.
