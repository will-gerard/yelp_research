Having been binging on Breaking Bad lately, I set off in search of a good chicken joint.  It's a tiny hole in the wall, so don't expect to eat here, but the prices are reasonable and you get a decent amount of food. I ordered the combo, which comes with grilled chicken, fajita beef, tortillas (corn or flour), beans, and pickled onions. Â¡Muy sabroso! I mopped up every bit with my tortillas, and finished my lunch stuffed and much satisfied.  Believe the hype, you won't be disappointed.

This is one of my favorite spots in the Phoenix area.  I'm fortunate enough to be able to see it on mornings that I take the light rail to work, but the place really shines at night. In cooler months (note: Phoenicians typically consider anything 90 degrees or below as "fall weather), it's an awesome place for a late afternoon/early evening run or just walk in the park. You'll see runners, families with their kids, and ASU students out enjoying the weather. Great to people watch, or, if you're feeling up to it, renting a kayak (I haven't tried it yet but hope to soon).  My favorite spot at night is the dam on the west end of the lake, over by the performing arts center. It's a spectacular view as the sun is setting and the area lights up once it gets dark. Perfect spot if you're looking for somewhere to take your date.  This is a pretty popular location for events. Oktoberfest takes place here every year and I'm told it's quite the scene.  Downside: Be aware of your surroundings once it gets dark. It's a nice time to enjoy the view and weather, and the times I've been there have been plenty of other people around, but homelessness is a big problem in Tempe and this is one of the areas they tend to congregate in.

This was my first pho experience in Phoenix, and, as you might've guessed by my five-star rating, I wasn't disappointed.  I'll start off with a disclaimer about the location: it's in one of Phoenix's sketchier areas, and I've never not seen a homeless person walking around in the strip mall it's located in. That being said, if you go in the day you should be fine. I can't speak to how ghetto it might get at night.  This isn't one of those Vietnamese places that invests a lot in ambiance. You walk in and usually are greeted by a busy wait staff and plenty of customers. I've never had to wait long for a table though. Compared to places I've been in Tucson, Albuquerque and California, the prices are a steal - a little over $5 for a decent sized bowl of some of the best pho I've ever had. One of the other reviewers praised the broth, and I have to agree - no need to drown it with hoisin and sriracha too much. They don't skimp on garnishings like some of the other places I've been too either. Their spring rolls make an excellent appetizer. If you're not in the mood for pho, feel free to grab one of their banh mi - also decently priced and plenty of bang for your buck.  All in all, a great place, and one that I look forward to returning to.

Coming from a Filipino, I wasn't all that impressed.  I usually head to the ASU Food Truck Block Party on Wednesdays to grab lunch with a couple coworkers. I had seen Hey Joe! there the past few times we had gone, but having grown up eating Filipino food with my dad's family, I was skeptical and gravitated to the other trucks. Since the Block Party has had more or less the same selection the past few weeks, I decided that this week I would finally give Hey Joe! a chance.  I imagine that for many of their customers, Filipino food is a new thing. The food wasn't god awful, so I can see why many the untrained taste bud might be raving about this. "Filipino food! Sounds different!"  I ordered the chicken adobo with rice, and a side of two lumpiang shanghai. Probably the most Filipino thing about my food was the fact that the "to-go" container consisted of two Dixie paper bowls covered in foil. The chicken adobo lacked that certain quintessential flavor that makes Filipinos everywhere crave it so much. The lumpia, or egg rolls as I wouldn't even call these real lumpia, had no pork, unlike most lumpiang shanghai, and the veggies inside left a bland taste. I did not receive any of the typical sweet chili sauce that you're supposed to eat lumpia with. I did receive a side of atchara, or pickled radish, with my lumpia, so at least they made an effort there.  If you really want to try Filipino food, I recommend going to one of the many restaurants we have in the Phoenix area.

$2 beers? How can I say no?  This is a pretty great place for your afternoon happy hour. It's not uncommon for a few of my coworkers to head over here if we get out early on Fridays. The menu selection is pretty varied, and service is usually pretty fast.  The decor aspires to be a bit hipster-esque, but not suffocatingly so. Don't feel out of place if cardigans and tight jeans aren't your thing. I like it because it's a nice change of pace from some of the more dive-y places on Mill. The crowd is usually pretty mixed, so you'll find young professionals, older adults, and college students.  Great place for a meet up with a friend or group.

I woke up yesterday morning with three words on my mind: "STEAK AND SHAKE."  Working across the street from this location, I was getting a little worried (okay, a lot worried) as the morning dragged on and my inbox became flooded with the e-mails of equally concerned co-workers panicking about the long line that was building up ahead of the grand opening. I work with quite a few people from the east coast, who had been telling me nothing but good things about the Steak 'n Shake chain ever since we found out one was opening on Mill. Luckily, once doors opened at 11 the line moved through quite quickly and me and my equally hungry coworkers had a window to grab our long-awaited fast food before the next wave started around noon.  I ordered the Original (it being opening day and my first time at a Steak 'n Shake, I had to go with the signature) with fries and a Cookies and Cream milkshake (trust me, you'll want to order the milkshake). Within ten minutes, my burgers and fries were gone and I was onto the milkshake. Hey, I'd pretty much been hungry all morning and the panic about the line didn't hurt.  I'd say this is comparable to an In 'N Out, but with a slightly pricier menu and more selection. I'm sure opening day won't be anywhere close to the last time I order from here.
