Honey Bears is an experience.  I don't want to see how clean their kitchen is(n't), use the restroom or walk to my car in the dark alone, but I CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!!  It is the best BBQ around hands down!  I LOVE the pulled pork sandwich and would eat anything drenched in their bbq sauce.  Its sweet and spicy with the perfect touch of vinegar-i-ness.  You definitely need quite a few of the paper napkins to clean up with afterwards.  Actually, just take a shower.    Their beans, coleslaw and peach cobbler are delicious too.  They also cater.  Its a dive, but TOTALLY worth the trip!

I could eat here almost every day.  During the day it is chill and relaxing.  At night its trendy and busy.  The service can be spotty, but the food and wine are worth it.  You can't go wrong with the bruscetta.  All of the choices are amazing.  Its a great place to go with friends.

Houston's is one of those places that never disappoints.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, lights dimmed just right, and food ALWAYS wonderful.    I used to only get the ribs here, and they are still my favorite.  Best in town.  Since my brother started working here I have expanded my choices.  First of all, they have sushi now.  Weird, I know, for an upscale American restaurant, but its really delicious.  Its not traditional sushi of course, but wonderful none the less.  Their veggie burger is one of my favorites anywhere, the seasonal veggie plate is awesome, and the thai steak and noodle salad is perfect.  Their coleslaw is the best I've ever had and the rice and beans side is surprisingly satisfying.  If they have Key Lime Pie, GET IT!!!!  You must save room or you are missing out!  The next thing I'm going to try is an order of ribs with a bun and coleslaw.  My brother says its the best sandwich you'll ever have.  Wow...i'm salivating.....Time for dinner!

This is one of my old standbys.  Great for takeout or eating there.  Its never that crowded and the food is awesome.  My absolute favorite is the green curry chicken.  If I could be sure no one saw me, I would lick the bowl!  The japanese teppanyaki beef is also wonderful.  The meet is super tender and the noodles are delish.  The malaysian cashew beef and lettuce wraps are also great choices.  I like the varitey they offer, lots of different asian flavors.  I'm moving farther away soon and am bummed it won't be right down the street.  But I'll still make the trip!

This is the perfect european neighborhood bakery.  They have different types of bread to take home (the foccacia is fantastic), yummy muffins and the BEST CROISSANTS EVER!!!  Regular or chocolate, they are amazing!  If they happen to have the apple foccacia, get it!  They don't make it often and its fantastic.  Their sandwiches are delicious too.  Simple and fresh.

I've been coming here for a while.  Their beer is really good and so is the food.  I really like the italian beef beer bread sandwich (with beer battered fries of course), the cheesy garlic beer bread, fish and chips and the az chicken rolls.  My favorite beers are the kiltlifter, hefe, and apricot (not sweet like it sounds).  The atmosphere is cool, but the service can sometimes be iffy.  Still worth it though.  Just wish they had a better happy hour....

I love Thai Pan.  I used to work up in that area and go a lot.  Sadly it is a little too far now for me to go often.  The couple that owns it is super nice.  Their style is very Pei Wei.  You order at the counter then they bring you the food.  Prices are very reasonable for such fresh ingredients and tasty dishes.  I have not had one bad thing there, but I am especially fond of the curries.  PLEASE PLEASE open a location further south!!!

I only have 1 wishes.....that I lived closer to Lalibela or that the'd open one closer to me.  I really enjoy their food.  It is flavorful and the price is great.  I always get the spicy combo, mild combo, collard greens and string beans and carrots.  Its plenty of food for 3 and super cheap, especially at lunch.  The injara (spongy sourdough pancake like bread you eat the food with) is delicious and high in protein.  They have really great desserts too.  Most definitely worth a trek if you don't live near by.  And if you do live close, I'm jealous.

Love the pita jungle!!!  My fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer.  Definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too.  Also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza.  You can't go wrong here.

This is my favorite wine bar around.  The wine selection is amazing and easy to navigate, even for a beginner.  There are just the perfect amount of choices.  Glasses and bottles are reasonably priced and they have great flights if you want to try out a few kinds.  They change it up enough that its never boring.    The food is fantastic too.  Great things to share.  My faves include the savory cheesecake, sliders, and all the flat breads.  They have salads too, but i never get those because the other stuff is too good.  The desserts are delicious as well.    The atmosphere is perfect!  Lights are dimmed just right, comfy seating, high top tables, bar or patio, its all just right.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  They have great specials mon-wed.  If you're in north scottsdale, you have to come here!

I just tried this place based on the reviews on here but I was disappointed. No ambiance, though that's not always a bad thing. The staff was courteous but the food left lots to be desired. The spring rolls,  which I always look forward to at Vietnamese restaurants, were wimpy. The pho was ok,  nothing special. I had to ask for cilantro on the side. I'd come here again if I was really craving pho and didn't have time to go anywhere else.

This place is amazing.  The atmosphere is cool, modern and retro at the same time.  The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  I love their cocktails.  I love the clams and the spicy shrimp pasta.  The olive oil cake for dessert is awesome too.  A must try!

What a great place!  It definitely has a dive feel, but it is so cool too!  We waited 30 min on a sunday, but it was well worth the wait.  There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try so I went with basic: eggs, bacon and hash browns.  So good!  The bacon was really crispy, the hashbrowns just right.  I will definitely go back and try other stuff.

I love this place!  Perfect for take-out or a casual dinner out.  My faves are the yellow curry noodles, panang curry and pad thai.  Portions are huge.  If you do take-out, get extra rice to soak up all the yummy sauce.  The employees are friendly and the prices just right.  The food is always delish.  One of my favorite little finds.

I have to agree with the recent reviews on this place.  I've only been there once and probably won't go back.  The service was mediocre at best.  The happy hour offerings were ok.  The best thing we had was the coconut shrimp.  There are much better places to get sushi in the valley.

I went to Tuck last night because of the reviews on here, and I loved it.  It really is tucked away and all the better.  It feels even more special.  We had the panini bites, dates stuffed with chorizo, and the citrus brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles.  Not your greasy comfort food here.  Everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try more.

I admit, the service here is inconsistent, but they are new and should improve with time.  The food is wonderful.  I've had breakfast and lunch and enjoyed both, though I'm partial to breakfast.  My favorite thing so far is the Hangover.  Turkey sausage, bacon, egg, carmelized onions and jalapenos and harissa aioli on sourdough bread (i like it better as a wrap).  Its the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  Great if you are hungover or not.  The salads are delicious and the portions are huge!   My friend loved the burger.   I can't wait to try their tacos.  Thats next.....

I've only been here for happy hour, but it's great! 3-6pm and 9-11pm, $2.95 taster menu with 8-10 items on it, drink specials on wednesdays. I've had everything on the taster menu and it's all amazing!!!  A friend and I shared 3 items and were stuffed.  I've had the pasta a la vodka, also amazing.  Definitely worth a visit!!!
