I am of Native American decent. I currently reside in Tempe and I've made three visits to this hospital for a TB test, screening, and an emergency situation. All of my visits were very pleasing. The staff definitely deals with lots of in and outpatients but also provides compassionate care if you treat them with the utmost respect.  The level of care that was provided was excellent, especially for a federally funded organization! It is crucial if you plan on making a trip to the express care is to definitely call and check if they have exceeded the amount of admitted patients, otherwise you'll come down and they will have a sign stating that you will have to return the next day.

Semi- hard to spot out from the surrounding plaza.   Walked in during the morning with a small rush. However, they had about 4 people working and they did everything to minimize their line and the wait time for the non-stop customers.   I ended up doing some pre-lab assessments for school here so I sat at one of the tables inside and could hear countless orders being taken. I also noticed how well the cashier knew her usuals!   These woman running this store this morning definitely provided superior customer service including knowledge of the drinks being created. What every Starbucks location should be on a daily basis.

Contemplated for a while whether or not we wanted to try this restaurant so we decided to finally try the place.   The staff could not be anymore friendly! But the food was not good at all. We ordered $10 crab cakes which looked like they were microwaved from a box. They had minimal taste and were not easy on the eyes.   Our food came shortly after and looked very pleasing. Surprisingly our meals were displeasing with tasting almost too dry. The pasta wasn't completely cooked thoroughly but it wasn't that big of a deal.   Overall, I gave two stars because the staff there were very accommodating. The choices from the menu were also pretty general.

As soon as you walk in you're greeted with friendly staff. The whole interior is beautiful. You're quickly asked if you want to sit inside or sit out on the patio.   If you're a patio person, come during the evening. The whole ambiance just seems to be romantic, that is if you're out on a date.   As soon as we sat down, our waitress came and introduced herself. It was a little difficult to hear her with all the Music and people there so maybe they should alert their staff members to speak up.   Our order was quickly taken along. If you don't know what type of food you want, come here. They have so many food choices to pick from for instance, Mexican, Italian, American etc. I went ahead with angel hair pasta with shrimp which in fact satisfied my appetite.   After dinner, you're going to be asked if you want dessert. I didn't know what kind of cheese cake to try so I asked our server what new comers normally try and are pleased with. She suggested I try the red velvet cheesecake so I went ahead and ordered that. It was probably one of the best cheesecakes I've had in a while. A little on the sweet side but I scraped majority of the frosting off.   Looking forward to coming back to another Cheesecake Factory, I might even come back to this specific location.   Great environment, friendly staff, and tasteful food.   (I'm giving four stars because our server was really nice until we left. It felt as if she was being nice to us up until we signed for the bill. I had just gotten off work but I don't think I looked like someone who wouldn't tip... Might I add, the rush server basically threw my plate on the table.)

We've been coming to Abuelo's for a while. Originally from New Mexico so it's pretty hard finding an actual authentic Mexican restaurant.   Surprisingly the salsa's offered as soon as you come in range from sweet to spicy which is a good thing if you like hot salsa or mild.   I always order the enchiladas which never disappoint.   The service here usually varies. We've had a handful of good servers but there is always an occasional bad server. She must've been having a bad day.   Overall, great food and environment.

My sister and I wanted to try something new but we were very unsure what we were wanting so we thought we'd go with the whole Mongolian "let's see them cook in front of us" place. I yelped here and there and noticed this place has extensive reviews. 4 stars with lots of reviews is hard to come by now days.   We walk in and we bypass the register so the lady immediately followed us and asked if it were our first time (clearly).  They have an option of bowls but there is only a dollar difference between small and large (we went with large).   You start by selecting the food you want from a small bar with numerous amounts of meats and vegetables. After that you get to pick your own seasonings that'll highlight your dish. The person at the register helps you with all of these options and is really helpful. After all your desires have been chosen you get to see the cook, cook your meal in front of you.   Along with the meal you get to pick up rice and soup with a drink (if you have gotten the meal). Which is a pretty sweet deal. After  our meal (which we didn't finish) we asked for to-go boxes which you have to pay fifty cents extra but with this being our first time she let us have them for free.   Overall experience was amazing. We definitely will be coming back but with empty stomachs. ;)

Thought we'd try something new other than Papa Johns. I'm very pleased to say we will be ordering from here in the future.   We were pretty skeptical whether or not we needed a large or extra large so we went to the XL Venezia supreme and hot wings.   The tasting of the pizza and wings were exquisite! Not too much marinara and just enough cheese. Our order was expected 45 to an hour wait but we ended up waiting about 40 minutes.   Very satisfied with our first experience.

I live around this area and this is the Starbucks location I always seek after if I want one of my favorite hand crafted drinks.  If you're like me and enjoy an occasional Starbucks drink, look no further. This location seems to hire happy, insightful, hard-working employees. They always seem to put effort into tending to your needs.   You know how when you go to a Starbucks looking forward to a signature espresso drink and they make it different than what you're used to? Well this location does not do that, in fact they may even just exceed your expectations.   I've never paid attention to the ratings through Yelp for Starbucks but this location actually deserves some gratification.   P.s. If you haven't had a PSL, you don't know what you're missing!

The staff was very nice. The service was fast and the barista knew exactly what I wanted and how to prepare it to my liking.   I would recommend anybody who would want to hangout or enjoy their favorite coffee at this location. Sofas and chairs are provided outside with shading.   Let's not forget the free wifi for those of you who are saving their data. Lol.

I normally don't order from Domino's due to lack of creativity but accounting for the time I needed a pizza delivered on a Sunday night; it was the only store open.   Ordering the pizza online could not be any easier but when the pizza came to my door the delivery guy gave me a receipt that was not only more than what I paid for, it was the wrong receipt. Obviously I used my card online so he needed a signature and he made me sign the receipt that wasn't mine. It was late, he probably had a long day so it wasn't that big of a deal. I ended up tipping the guy anyway.   The pizza that was delivered were prepared horribly! One pizza was overly cooked and had almost no cheese at all. The other pizza had a fair amount of cheese but the crust WAS NOT thoroughly cooked. It was a huge let down and definitely made up my mind to stay away from Dominos. :/

The place is very easy to find but you may get confused with two other buildings that are close by. Parking may be a bit of a hassle depending on what day and time you're there.   Despite the small issues the coffee and breakfast is definitely worth driving around the parking lot on a Saturday afternoon! The choice of beans they use for their espresso have a rich, bold and intense flavor that'll leave you wanting more.   I live in Tempe and the drive there is definitely worth it. If you're coming alone, bring a book, you'll look like a regular.

The prices may have been rated differently than Starbucks, but they are pretty similar when you retrieve your item total.  I walk into the coffee shop and greeted quickly by the cashier.  It was my first time coming to the place because I was in need of coffee. I had a little trouble with the menu deciding on what to order. So I ask her what would be good or what she would recommend.   I ended up asking her what was similar to a caramel macchiato and she suggested a vanilla hazelnut macchiato. I ordered a large and the price was very related to the venti iced latte from Starbucks but the cup seemed to be smaller than Starbucks.   With all the comparison aside, my iced latte was very good.   Customer service was also very, very, good. I would come back but maybe if Starbucks isn't open. :)

If you're going in after 8 pm make sure and try your latte! I know some employees like to start cleaning early and don't want to use the espresso machine, which will result in your latte tasting like a hot, high-sugar content frappuccino!   Very upsetting because this location always makes great coffee. However, the amount of ratings state otherwise.

The food is good and so are the options BUT..  The food could be so much better! The food did look like it was left out and was only bothered when a customer walked through the door. The girl who helped me was very nice!   However, the supervisor came to help another customer and her entire attire was just a mess! I felt inclined to tell her to fix herself up. Not out of disrespect but this woman's hair was really bushy and she had white flakes around her entire uniform (she wore a black polo) shirt. I ended up eating the food which was actually pretty decent.   Two weeks later I drove by the place again (to go to Starbucks) and saw the same bushy haired woman through the window. My sister was in the passenger seat and said "Look at that girl! Why isn't she wearing a hair net?" I mean this was through the window of my car and the restaurant.  I didn't leave a review before but after seeing that again I thought I should give civilians a heads up. I mean if someone doesn't feel their appearance should be maintained while at work, then who knows how they run the place - especially a supervisor!  Thank God I didn't get sick because I noticed some reviews said they had. If you decide to eat here you better pray over your food.

Was pretty skeptical about coming to this place reading the previous reviews about customer service and the ambiance.   We ended up coming here forcing ourselves because the reviews about "the best coffee in town" really did catch my attention. We come in through the back and come to the counter asking if we came through the wrong door. The cashier really didn't mind and told us how many doors to the coffee shop their actually was - there are three.   We come from the whole Starbucks iced caramel macchiato scene so we weren't too sure what to order. We asked the barista what she'd recommend to someone who enjoyed an iced CM from Starbucks and she mentioned the agave latte, white mocha, or the regular latte.  I'm pleased to announce that the agave latte is divine. The natural sweetener has a certain taste alongside the espresso.  My sister and my experience here could not have been more pleasing. Definitely coming back. :)

Thought I'd try a new coffee shop so I found this little place. It's actually located 3 minutes from my place. I should have walked.   The location is a bit hard to find but I got it. It's actually connected with the barber shop so if you want to come get some coffee, latte, etc. and you're in need of a touch up. Come down this way.   It's a bit small inside but seating is throughout the building and continues outside to a patio. It's a pretty chic cafe if you're into those classic coffee shops.   It's a Saturday and there is only one guy making drinks and on register so if you're in a hurry I don't think this place would be suitable. But if you're looking for a place to hang out and you got time on your hands then this will work.   I ordered an iced caramel macchiato with soy. The espresso in the coffee is Devine. I can taste every bit of the caramel and the espresso. Just made the wait worth it.   Great service and great coffee.

I live in Tempe and I work in Paradise Valley. Tweaked my schedule to drive all the way to this barber shop because they do pretty good hair cuts. I guess the only thing they're bad at is opening the store on time. Three guys including myself were waiting by the door for the shop to open. 20 mins later and I ended up leaving.   Bad for business not to open according to the time printed on your building..

I used to go to this Barber shop in the past but quite some time ago the shop didn't open accordingly to the time that was posted.   I started going to another barber shop near Paradise Valley which did pretty good haircuts. The owner of 'Who's Next' had sent me a message trying to resolve the issue and offered a haircut on the house. These guys know how to cut hair so after work I decided to take him up on the offer.   Later, he explained what had happened the day that I came and the shop was not open. We're all human and things do happen so it was all water under a bridge.   The amount of precision that was put into my hair definitely made me consider coming back to this shop. I always walk out feeling very sharp.   I live in Tempe so I'm pretty far from this shop but trust me, the drive is well worth it if you're tired of  your neighborhood barber outside of North Scottsdale.

It has been a whole year since I've been trying some Pho. Thankfully for Yelp I came across this place with enough reviews to convince me to try some Pho here.   We come into the restaurant and it is actually a lot larger inside than it looks from the outside. Everybody inside was really nice and inviting. People who were coming in for lunch were greeted with recognition which was pretty nice knowing that people were coming back.  We started with egg roll appetizers and we have never had egg rolls with lettuce wraps. They were amazingly good! Our pho had came to our table and the smell was amazing. I ended up adding the jalepeno and the hotness of the broth had released the chili aroma and was just enough spice. The only complaint about the pho was how the chicken had tasted. The chicken had look and tasted like it came from a package. I'm not too sure why it had an odd taste but it did not set to well with me.  I would definitely come back to this location for some pho. Another reason I would come back is for the surrounding asian market.

I've hiked Camelback numerous times but this hike was definitely challenging. I went early in the morning. The drive from Tempe was about a good 30 minutes so you might want to take that into consideration if you are coming from the city. Also, you will have to bring plenty of water.   The hike was gorgeous! Definitely worth the effort. Bring a change of socks and change them until you reach the top. There are also a variety of flower bushes on the trail which attracts many bees so you may want to bring a sting ease cream JUST IN CASE. I had no problem with the bees but I did get worried at times.   If you feel like a challenge Flat Iron is the way to go.

Wanted to get some italian food so we thought of going to Olive Garden. Thankfully, i decided to look something up on Yelp! and I'm excited to say I'm glad I used the app to find this place.   We all ordered the eggplant parmesan with salad. The salad and the dressing that it comes with compliments each other very well! I do not remember how many refills of salad we had gotten that day.  The eggplant itself was amazingly good! There was also sufficient amount of eggplant that was given. Definitely quality italian food.   Our server was also really great! She also gave us a slice of espresso cake, which was probably one of the best cakes I've had in a while. I could be exaggerating but it really did taste good.   Check it out for yourself. You will not be disappointed.

First time coming to the place and our server Brea couldn't have been nicer. I wasn't familiar with the menu so I asked her for some suggestions.   The happy hour here seemed pretty cheap. The food was exceptional. I would definitely come back.   We went from the dining room out to the patio considering how nice of a day it was outside.   Overall satisfaction with our visit. Great place to eat and pretty cool environment. I would recommend anyone to come and visit this downtown grill and pub.

This place is a bit sketchy from its exterior but don't let that fool you. The staff inside are really nice and want to help resolve your issue with the utmost regards.   I've been here twice because we all know Arizona highways loves throwing rocks at us! They have this deal if you have more than one crack it's an additional $10 for fill the next crack (after agreeing to $24 for the first crack), which is not bad at all.   The reason I gave this place 4 stars is because the inside looks terrible. If you're going to have great workers and great customer service you need a nice environment. I've had 5 cracks filled total from here and if they keep this up I will be going back (hopefully not anytime soon!) lol.

Being raised within New Mexico and in contact with hatch chili, the Hatch Burger was surprisingly spicy! It was good but it would have been much better with some lettuce tomato and onion, which is offered in the menu.   I did notice a woman order a mac and cheese burger, which is why I will be going back to try such an intriguing burger. Do not order your burger with water. A root beer or a beer would definitely leave you feeling full and satisfied.

I called the post office yesterday because apparently my package was dropped off at my apt. The guy on the phone was pretty sarcastic and told me my package was at the post office and that it would be ready for pick up in the morning.   I come to the post office the next morning and a woman helped me. She was very nice to the guy in front of me but was very rude to me. I told her about my situation. She went to look for my package and came back telling me that the postal man had said he left it at my apt complex yesterday.   Of course I was skeptical about the package so I asked a couple of questions and she replied with yes or no answers. I don't know if she was cranky but they had just open so I don't know what her problem was.   I go back to my apt. Office and they don't have it. Apparently the postal office have new employees who screw up all the time.   Very annoying.

It's pretty inconvenient for us to drive all the way from Tempe. But the last time we ordered sleeves through the mail the majority of them were damaged.   Making the commute is always worth the drive. The staff here are always very tentative and nice. They know their stuff and we always seem to have something to talk about when it comes to coffee. Also, they always have tips on how to create different beverages with your specific Nespresso machine.   When sampling drinks they always seem very knowledgeable about the tastes and what a customer seeks in relation to their coffee preference. I mean what coffee company lets you try their espresso/coffee before purchasing?

I go into the barber and the wait for someone's hair to be finished, which happens to be an additional hour. I'm next and tell the guy what I want done to my hair. I told him I wanted the sides of my hair to be straight and not rounded off. Any barber knows what rounding off the sides mean in a fade and I made it perfectly clear that was not what I wanted.   I'm in the chair for a good 45 minutes and so much time and effort is given into my cut. The guy immediately places gel into top of my hair without asking and come to find out he is using the gel to help guide him through the rest of the hair cut.   The guy finishes my hair and spikes my hair in the middle of my head, which result in a fohawk/mohawk! The price for the haircut was $15 and they did not have any change so out of decency i ended up leaving him a $20, which was a $5 tip.   If you are the type of person who describes to your barber how you want your hair to look, maybe this place is not for you. I am very displeased, feel very embarrassed,  and may have to get it fixed or wear a bag over my head!  Oh, I also drove around on Priest and University looking for the damn place because yelp guides you to a false location.

Very close to home so thought I'd come here before church.   The staff here are extremely nice and are very productive.   The external environment does not do the building any justice as to how big it is inside. It's very modern inside with a touch of that old coffee house chic furniture.   My order came out perfect. Great location but a little hard to get into.   I would definitely come back to this location

I was looking for a  barber shop that was close to Paradise Valley and this happened to have great reviews and seemed inexpensive.   I came into the barber shop and was slightly greeted by whom I believe to be the owner.   Waited not too long but noticed that there were a family of kids getting their haircuts. The guy cutting them did an exceptional job and treated the entire family very kindly. If you have kids, this place knows how to deal with them.   I'm very particular when it comes to my hair being cut by another person but my directions are not to complex. I told the barber what I wanted and he pretty much went over the top dealing with my head of hair.   Definitely worth the drive and if I ever need a haircut again, I'll be making the trip.

The course provided was very thorough. The instructor definitely cared if you passed the course.   I have taken my BLS/CPR card from a different location and felt like I didn't learn anything but had passed. I passed this course and obtained so much information and definitely feel I can perform the actions anytime when needed.   I definitely recommend this course to anyone seeking this certification.

I started my membership back in June and it was a definitely a nice gym. Everything was cleaned occasionally by the staff members and everyone was always nice upon your arrival/departure.  The amount of equipment is basically what you pay for (BASIC EQUIPMENT).   The reason I have to give a 1 star review is because while I tried to cancel my membership, the staff had an entirely different attitude towards me. Not only myself, but my roommate decided to join me and my transfer to LifeTime fitness (*ahem* no ending contract fees along with an entirely better facility).   I was well aware that I had to pay a contract ending fee so it was no problem. However, while I was trying to end my membership the attitudes were very snotty and made it very hard for me to cancel; my roommate experienced the exact same thing.   Their motto is "judgement free zone," which I guess only pertains to current members or people trying to join. This experience was definitely displeasing.   Don't trust a gym that serves free pizza and bagels!

I drove from Tempe just to get my haircut here because the price was reasonable and the ratings were pretty high.   The customer service skills that this place offers is exceptional! As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted by two of the employees. I was quickly assisted with Cody. I hadn't been to this shop before but I'm sure glad I made the trip.   The amount of time and precision that was out into my haircut was great. I don't remember the last time I've gotten a fade as neat as this.   I also noticed while getting my haircut people were starting to line up. One of the employees had offered water or beer while they waited. Which is pretty cool to me. I'd definitely come back and would recommend anyone who were wondering about the facility.

Second time trying pho and this has to be the best place for spring rolls and  pho. Only downside is the amount of Pho broth you can order is chicken or beef but the chicken definitely went well with the shrimp.  Unlike the first pho I had I actually wanted to finish the entire broth! The guy who was taking our order was very nice and also very helpful. We are definitely coming back for more pho and spring rolls. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is a pho fanatic or someone who wants to try pho.   I've driven by the place numerous times and had never known that this hidden gem existed.

If you come here you're in for a treat. Ordering may take a while because you're trying to decide what to have.   I ended up trying the snow crab, shrimp, and calamari. They were all very good. If you want something spicy then you've come to the right place.   If you have no problem peeling your food and getting your hands a little dirty then you wouldn't mind eating here. I had to clean my shrimp down from head to tail. It'll take some time to get use to but you'll get the hang of it.   The service was excellent, but it would've been nice if they picked up some of the things off of the table. Another thing that bothered me was how many flies or gnats were around our table. It was pretty disgusting having to guard my friends food while he went to the bathroom.   Overall food was good and so was the service.

My first visit I ordered the breakfast tacos and they were delicious. My second trip I ordered the breakfast burrito and the green chili had a little spice. I had added ham with the burrito and it was most pleasing.   Their americanos are pretty good. However,  I cannot say the same about the coffee pancakes. Otherwise, great service and great food.

We were tired of our regular sushi places so I sought after something new. This location had plenty of reviews to decide to venture out of our comfort zone.   We tried the jalapeño poppers and they were amazing. All of the sushi rolls we ordered (Las Vegas, Phoenix, and shrimp tempura) were prepared very well.   The only complaint I had was how long it took for our order to come out. After looking back on our experience, I've settled with "you can't rush perfection."
