I can't say enough great things or comments about how awesome of a treatment my entourage and I get with every visit. From stellar and classy customer service, to exquisite and delicious cocktails, great music, clean atmosphere, a vast pool area, plenty of seating for gatherings or small get-togethers...the list goes on! This is what a proper bar should be like! Kudos to the management team for always giving us a warm welcome. I'm hooked!

Horrible service. They messed up my bread bowl, called back and asked me if I wanted a $5 when clearly, the bread-bowl is $10. This is an utter insult!!!! I'm also filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau about this type of service.

Love the service and food here! Not as ethnic or authentic as Polibertos but one can never go wrong with their burritos or horchatas! A great place to frequent for lunch or dinner!

Loved the atmosphere and the wines! You don't have to drive to Scottsdale to find a great place to dine when it's right across from your house!

First of all, I'd like to attest that I've been a customer here for a while and one bad experience has completely changed my opinion about the type of service given here. Last night I invited 3 friends who had never been to this restaurant for happy hour. The bartender argued with me about the drink I ordered, which wasn't alcoholic to begin with. Took them over 15 minutes to take our order and there was no particular attention or checkup on how we were doing. The "so called" manager who I called and spoke to this morning happened to be the same guy who was chit-chatting with the bartender, instead of serving us or providing elite service. May this be a lesson learned to your company as I will take this matter to the corporate level. It's a shame to see the kind of management running this place when there's no certain reassurance on the type of expected service most loyal customers are accustomed to when they bring other clients into the scene.

Horrendous customer service! The night manager used profanity when arguing with me about an order she COMPLETELY screwed up for a party of 4 and when asking for a refund she responded, "Have a great night" while hanging up on me! I'm sorry Geno's but you just lost a loyal client and I'll make sure others are aware of the kind of service you provide there!

There are many reasons as to why I'm never coming back to this so-called "pizza pub." First of all, service has been declining ever since it came into new management. The food is utterly mediocre since it's not made fresh and the ingredients are dismal! The pizza dough, which is made elsewhere, is delivered at night in front of everyone and not discreetly distributed from the back patio, which is very tacky and unprofessional. The only good thing about this place, which is the only reason that I gave it a one star, is the Karaoke, which has also been on a downward spiral. Due to some recent events as to how my entourage was treated in, I've taken the initiative to make this bar known for it's horrendous service towards the public and previous loyal clientele such as us. May this be a lesson to the new management team who run this business, as others will be posting similar reviews in the future regarding their practices.
