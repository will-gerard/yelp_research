We were so annoyed at the Scottsdale Hilton facility that we checked out a day early and went to Best Western Supersitition Springs Inn and Suites.  It was everything the Hilton had not been.  Wonderful bed, quiet room, extra cotton blanket, generous and delicious breakfast and really friendly staff.  We would recommend it highly and will stay there again.

It is hard for me to write negative reviews, but this one was easy!  The price was expensive and the hotel was cheap.  Long walk to room and the bed was not that comfortable. When I asked about getting a discount for military, I was informed that we were lucky to be getting it at $169. because they usually charge $250 and it is high season in Scottsdale.  Then they charge you for everything! But it was especially annoying to be told that if I just checked email, I would be charged $10.00.  Got nachos from the outside patio and they were filled with gristle and fat. Yuck.  We were supposed to stay for three nights and we moved to  the Best Western Superstition Springs Inn and Suites and had a wonderful room and a great breakfast for 89.99.  I was going to just chalk it up except I just received an email from their customer service department and   Dave Horton Global Head - Hilton Hilton Hotels  I decided he was a day late and a dollar short asking if we were happy there. Perhaps the staff should have mentioned to him that we asked for tea bags and they were going to charge us! Gimme a break.  It was noisy in the rooms at night as well as the conference rooms during the day.  I am going to write a glowing report on the Best Western Superstition Springs Inn, so watch for that one.  Then you will know that I am usually a nice person who is easy to get along with.
