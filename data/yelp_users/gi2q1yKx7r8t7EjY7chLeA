I think I've eaten about half the lunch menu here and have yet to be disappointed. Friendly staff, great food. I would definitely recommend the red curry or pad prik king...or the spicy noodle.

The food and ambiance were both decent at best. Food was extremely bland. Only upside was the server seemed to be quite knowledgeable and friendly.
