Very upset this place has closed. Please come back! One of the few places in town where you can get healthy take-out.

June, the owner at Cutter's Cottage, is a gem! She knows color. She knows cuts. She knows how to keep a conversation going! She's been doing my hair for more than 10 years and keeps me looking stylish. The stylists that work here all seem to really know their stuff, especially Yusenia and Rebecca.

In the worst economy I've seen in Arizona in 30 years, Biltmore Fashion Park has just decided to institute PAID parking at its shopping center. This is insulting to the locals who consider BFP their neighborhood mall and shop here frequently. And it favors the ultra wealthy...a valet actually told me it's his job to "protect the patron's luxury vehicles." When I asked him if my $35,000 car met his definition of luxury, he gave me a blank look. Ridiculous. The ever-widening gap between the classes isn't being helped by policies like this. Hey, BFP management...remember the French Revolution?

This place has really good food for dine in or take out. Order the pecan chicken (not on the menu) with shrimp-fried rice. Delish! Great lunch specials here too. I don't think they do any advertising or they'd be packed every night. Neighborhood gem!

I have two dogs and bought their Optimum Wellness Plan to help with the high cost of vet bills. Pre-scheduled visits and the annual wellness exam are handled professionally, but when my dog got sick, they couldn't see her. They were too busy. They recommended I call another Banfield, which also was too busy. So I'm asking myself, what good is a pet hospital and a monthly plan if you can't even get your dog in when they REALLY need to be seen? And I'm not talking just waiting a day...I'm talking waiting weeks. It's ridiculous. I won't be signing up for this again.

I hate it when I call a store and can't get a live person on the line or anyone to pick up the phone once I've been transferred--which was the case with the plumbing department at this location. You suck.

Fantastic coffee and lots of yummy baked goods. It's become quite a hipster hangout, which has its pluses and negatives. Sometimes it's hard to find a quiet place to work or talk. And parking can be tough on busy weekend mornings. But it's a non-chain Phoenix original, so I'm a fan.

Worst. Place. Ever. My dog was vomiting, hadn't eaten in 3 days and lethargic. I called 4 vet offices and couldn't get her in for treatment. One vet recommended I take her to this place, an emergency treatment center. We arrived at 8:20 a.m. and there were no other clients in the lobby waiting. I filled out the paperwork, then a vet tech came out to look at her. She said her heart rate was elevated, probably due to hydration. They told me there were dogs in the back that were being treated, so I'd have to wait. After an hour, they told me it would be another hour before my dog could be seen, but if a sicker dog came in, they couldn't guarantee it. I told the receptionist that there was NO ONE else waiting. She said it didn't matter because they had to take care of the dogs in the back first. I called another vet office and made an appointment for later in the day, which, to me, was risky because she was already pretty sick. Then I left. What's an emergency animal clinic good for if you can't even get your dog treated within a reasonable timeframe? And cost wasn't even my concern. I'm so tired of bad service and bad people. And this place is just another business with both.

Having Hana's quality sushi in my "hood" has been a real boon. The food is always good, the restaurant vibe energetic, and the waiters super fun. That's why I was sooooo disappointed to have a bad experience there. Hubby and I went out for dinner recently and were told by the host that the two open tables were now being reserved for walk-ins of parties of 4 only because, "we make more money off them." That's exactly what he said. He told us that something at the sushi bar was sure to open up soon. Thirty minutes later and still waiting, we now had a growing crowd of two's on the wait list. A party of three walked in and were seated IMMEDIATELY. We should have walked out right then, but we were so hungry we figured it couldn't be much longer. Wrong. We waited another 20 minutes until a table finally opened up. Meanwhile, the table for four remained empty. This is a BAD policy. Seating should be first-come, first-served. I will only be doing takeout there from now on.  The food is 4 star. The wait policy is 1 star.

This place sucks. Was told to avoid hour and a half wait to go in the lounge. Sat at a dirty table (only one available) and was totally ignored for 15 minutes so we left. Never again.

The good news: You can save $10 per ticket by pre-purchasing online.  The bad news: You will wait one hour for each ride.  I took my adult sons here for a day of birthday fun and we were so terribly disappointed. The ride lines were long and so slooooow. Everyone was complaining. I just can't understand how Disney can get this right but no one else seems to be able to. PEOPLE AT WET & WILD: hire an efficiency expert to fix this problem.   Oh yeah, and you need more of those 4-people rafts. Half the waiting was because you didn't have enough of them.  When families spend this kind of money to go to the water park, they want to have fun. Not wait. Yes, there is a fast-pass you can buy for ANOTHER $20, but I saw those people waiting, too.  Another nit...a bottle of water is $3.99. And a double scoop of Thrifty (ha) ice cream cost me $5.00.  Really, truly disappointing. I won't be back.

Very unhappy with this place. Spent over $50 on dinner for self, hubby and two sons (19) and (22). After dinner, went into bar area to shoot a game of pool and were asked to leave because my younger son wasn't 21. I find this ridiculous since Arizona law says servers must be 19 to serve alcohol. We were there as a family, weren't drinking and just wanted to have a fun family night. I won't be spending my money here any more.

So I thought the beauty of the Drybar was that you could walk in and get your hair done. Nope, apparently you have to book an appointment well in advance (which is something I could do with my regular stylist). I went last weekend, and this place was wall-to-wall with bookings. Really frustrating. Why don't they have a "floater" stylist who can take walk-ins? There are certainly enough hairstylists out there who need jobs. I just can't understand why so many businesses aren't business people. They never seem to see the need and fill it.

So thank you Drybar for resolving my issue by allowing me to try you again. It was very responsive and generous. My stylist was personable and did a great job.

Delicious wine. Divine pizza. Depictions of Italian street life on wall murals. And a surprise treat at the end of the meal. This place offered up a great dinner experience a deux for hubby and I.  The Margherita pizza was simple...and simply delicious. We shared one pie and a salad, and then a slice of the Hazelnut Torte cake. Yummmm. The waitress was knowledgeable about the wine list and suggested two reds that we also really liked.  After our meal, the chef brought us a special (and unexpected) treat...homemade limoncello shots and powdered sugar-coated crispy dessert bites.  After a meal like this, the only thing I was left craving was a spin on a Vespa!

Warm friendly people and good coffee. The owners are from East Africa and they make an organic iced tea with their own special spice blend of cinnamon, cardamom and more.

Reserved breakfast at The Henry for Mother's Day. Just hubby, myself and two pups. Pups aren't allowed on the dining patio, only in the very front, which they don't normally make a reservation for (because it's first come-first served for quick coffee and pastries). But they made an accommodation for us. Had a nice shady table in the front where we could catch views of Camelback Mountain and people watch.  This place is turning into an Arcadia hotspot and we saw lots of folks, mostly well-heeled, coming and going with their families. But it's also a good place to enjoy coffee or made-to-order Bloody Mary's with friends. Like all Fox Restaurants, the interior is well designed and the menu is innovative, but I kind of wished they had more traditional breakfast staples. For example, they offer carrot cake pancakes and caramel apple french toast...which sound decadent...but too dessert-like for me for breakfast.   I had the Flower Child Scramble with organic eggs, kale, mushrooms, asparagus, peas and parmesan accompanied by potatoes. It was good, but didn't come with toast, so I ordered a side of the Cheddar Popovers to nosh on while waiting for the main entree. Hubby had the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito, which he enjoyed. I also ordered the "Drop Out" latte with caramel and it was delish.   The bill for two was around $50, so not a cheap place for breakfast, but good for special occasions.

Was looking for a good used car for my 20-year-old son. I found the car on the Internet and made an appointment to come and see it. The salesperson was waiting upon our arrival and made the whole test drive/paperwork process smooth and easy.   There was a problem with vibration at idle, but he gave us a coupon to bring it in for service to have it fixed for free. They worked with us on the money so that my son could add a stereo system.  The finance process was relatively painless and Antoine was very kind.  All in all, a great used car buying experience.

The service guys at Camelback Subaru are great! Kyle and Robert are the best! Always helpful and honest and I never feel like I'm being ripped off.
