Absolutely most incompetent store... Zero customer service. Unfortunately I will continue to return but I dread going to this store more than anything... it's not worth the few extra dollars you think you save.

Great little bar with good food. Service was top notch from both our bartenders as we came in during shift change over. We will be back, next time we'll have to ride our beach cruisers up!   Club Sandwich was HUGE!

The security staff ruined our trip to this stadium. Absolutely zero respect and lack of rationalization skills by the manager and supervisor! Unfortunately we lost the cost of our tickets because of the lack of forward thought this stadium has. A set of lockers for purses that are too large for the irrational guide lines would be a money maker for the stadium.

Philip is right! This place is legit... the other one off of Thomas has really gone downhill

Fantastic!! I've driven by this place a few times planning to stop by one day and I finally did! Great food, had the chicken souvlaki pita and salad, it was amazing. The pita was delicious and the salad was perfect size with lots of topping and fresh cold lettuce. Staff was awesome, the girl running the front counter was really friendly and incredibly efficient. Kudos to the staff, I'll be back!

Awesome place... the food is awesome, drink specials all day and the staff do a great job. When my friends come into town, we always make this a spot for dinner and some drinks!  If you don't like the food, I'm sorry but you made your own bowl- its your fault!!

Carne Asada plate is awesome with fresh chopped onions and cilantro with hand made tortillas... can't go wrong!  Don't forget to bring cash!

Eurotechs is the new home for my Jag!! Jerry is both honest and very knowledgeable.... I spent 2 months dealing with another tech that jerked me around with parts and prices... in 1 week Jerry had my X-Type back on the road. Found me a used part that didn't break the bank, suggested we go this route first because he knew how much I had dumped into it before and installed my new H.I.D lighting system while we were waiting for the part. Over all a great experience!   Jerry you have made me a loyal customer! (Because I own a Jag, I'm sure I'll be back!)

Save your money and skip Salty's... This place went downhill with the new spot. Customers service was a joke, to-go food was lousy to say the least (chicken fajitas undercooked, dried-hard rice.. and flour tortillas when the menu reads CORN tortillas) I finally had to flag down a server and ask her to check on my food. The bartenders where too busy flirting with the staff to offer another beer while I waited or update me on the food.  There are plenty of spots in Old Town... I doubt I'll be back

My wife paid for a 3-day cleanse, I decided to drive down from my office in N Scottsdale after work to pick it up for her.  Apparently they decided to close early?! It's 6:30 pm and their hours read open till 8pm, she even called this morning to let them know she would pick it up AFTER work and she was told no problem. This is how you lose customers!

Hands down the best prices and customer service. No up selling, just great and honest advice. And the owners policy "if you don't like it bring it back" makes you feel comfortable trying new supplements. I've stopped shopping 5 different websites for the best deal... Firebird is my go to!

Awesome place, I happened to stumble upon this place while out shopping and taking a look on Yelp. Met the owners of the shop, they are true believers in what they do and the quality of their product.... and I am too! Good luck in your future endeavors, if you open a shop in N.Scottsdale I'll be your first customer!

Quite possibly one of my best finds thru Yelp. Awesome little cafe that does breakfast and lunch... and they do it right! Small rotating menu of some great food, super reasonable prices and did I mention.. this is a non-profit organization! Proceeds go to help feed children in need through out Arizona.   Do yourself a favor and give them a try.  Thanks again guys, I'll be back again! Maybe even 2 times in one day again.
