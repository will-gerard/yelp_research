This has to be one of my favorite breakfast places near Tempe. Although it is a little frustrating when it is super busy(which is majority of the time) it is well worth it. And for a college student, it a little out of budget so I only go here when the parents visit or to treat myself!   I am obsessed with the chocolate pumpkin muffins.  My only thing is I feel like I see people that have ordered really cool dishes yet I never see them on the menu? Am I missing something?  Great food, entertaining atmosphere, couldn't ask for more

My roomie and I decided to go shopping at Kierland mall to torture and remind ourselves about all the money we DONT have.... And despite the holes in our pockets we decided to still divulge in the holes in our stomachs. A girl's gotta eat! We ended up at Zinc Bistro which is a french inspired restaurant. My roomie is vegetarian so she got a boring dish(the house salad) and I got the bistro boulliaise( I cant spell) and it was DELICIOUS! risotto and this soup and scallops, rock shrimp, and salmon although I did substitute salmon with more scallops. Service was decent and I loved the atmosphere. Not too over the top despite the uh giant lit up Eiffel Tower in the middle of the restaurant... Everything went well and I would love to go back there soon!

AMAZING! im obsessed.... we have gone the past two days because it is just so magical. Love snow cones and their ice is soo finely shaved. an immense amount of flavors to choose from and also smoothies, coffee, ice cream.  Bonus though, you can order 60 snowballs for 12 bucks! How cool is that? they put them in a cooler and you are good to go for a snowball fight! We are having one tonight i will have to let you know how it goes. This place is definitely worth experiencing especially in this AZ weather

The Hen and I (thats what I call my mother) finally tried this place that everyone has been raving about. I was a little nervous since sometimes when people stress about how great a place is then it never lives up to your expectations. Definitely wrong about that! We sat at the bar and I wish I could remember the bar tender's name that served us because he was amazing! We had amazing wine and food and I cannot wait to come back for happy hour!

I am putting 4 stars because my lunch was absolutely delicious! I went to lunch yesterday february 26th with a good family friend and I had the roasted chicken sandwich with the pasta salad and he had the Reuben, I think. Sandwich was amazing and I feel the other fellow yelpers were right this place is very tasty :)    However, our service was not up to par AT ALL. He was tall, slender with a dark beard with hints of grey in it..hmm well I was waiting for my guest and ordered a cup of coffee.. so far so good. When my guest finally arrived we waited about 15 minutes until he approached us. He asked what my guest wanted to drink and the minute he said ill just have water and was about to say we are ready to order or waiter was gone. He rushed away, dropped off water and left again! So confused... then when we finally flagged him down he un-enthusiastically recommended some entrees(since we bother have not been there) and that was about it. Not personal at all. No fun!   Great food, will come back for that but hopefully next time we will have quality service to go along with their quality food!

AMAZING! Extremely over stimulating though. I felt as if I needed about five different brains to take all the commotion in!  There was everything going on and let me tell you not once did I feel the slightest bit un-entertained! You must go!  Contortionists kind of scared me but other than that the diving and the big black guy in a thong. Too great not to experience! Definitely splurge and get front row seats, I feel as if the nose bleeds would not be as effective.

I went here on a wednesday night and it was packed. I was surprised yet our service was pretty decent considering the crowd. sushi was not bad, a little over priced but what can you expect--sushi in scottsdale.

I went to Vegas last weekend and found out my parents were going to be there as well and decided to mooch of them for an evening. Starving college student ya know? Well fortunately for me my parents and their friends were going to the Bellagio to eat at Prime and then see the show "O" which is amazing by the way!   First of all, this restaurant oozes high class and high expectations. I enjoyed the ambiance and loved how you can view the water fountain show while enjoying your intense meal!  Despite the fact that everyone at my table ordered the filet, I decided to go with the braised short ribs.  Eh, they were okay, but my mom's filet was to die for. Thats why I only gave 4 stars. My meal was good but not as orgasmic as my expectations and but my momma's was perfect. Dessert was fantastic. I got the chocolate cake!  If you an afford it, GO!

Went to celebrate with my honey and a friend suggested this place. First of all, great atmosphere. Second of all we were seated right away in the restaurant and decided we wanted to sit outside. The hostess was super nice and accommodated for us right away. I always feel like an annoying person doing that and the hostess definitely did not make me feel that way! Ordered some wine and the roasted chicken flat bread to start. That was yummy. Then I ordered the white fish (which was a halibut) and he ordered the pork chile verde AMAZING! our waitress Elena was awesome and extremely attentive/informative. My only thing was that they brought out the entrees while we were still eating our appetizer. Not that big of a deal to be honest.

I went here last night with some friends from out of town who I havent seen in awhile (I know it was valentines day but we were celebrating being single of course)! We also wanted to watch the olympic ice skating and relax. I showed up late (horrible habit) and found them in the center of the room... apparently they had just ordered so I quickly looked over the menu. 10ish minutes passed by and not a single waiter in sight.. except for the one playing video games so I politely went over and asked if I could order and he said go to the bar and ask (i forget her name) so I went over there and she said she would find my server for me. I said thank you and sat down. 5 minutes later still nothing. 10 minutes later our server does appear with every one else's food! All I wanted was some water and some wings.. Needless to say I finally got my food (honey bbq wings) and was happy but the service..yuck!

Pitaya is a relatively new store that I absolutely love! It is organized by color which makes it very pleasing to the eye as well as easy to locate certain items of clothes.  The best part about the store is the customer service! I have never been helped so well--the girls there made sure I was never lugging around my clothing that I wanted to try on and gave genuine, honest opinions.  Definitely is a place to check out if you are on Mill Ave.

mmm I love me some Dutch Brothers. I have yet to talk to someone there that is not friendly and fun. Perfectly located near campus for all the caffeine -hungry students that need to stay up late to catch up on papers that are due the following morning. Not only is it a good location with awesome staff but the coffee is amazing too. I love the Kahlua Kicker and I am also a major fan of the iced chai tea lattes as well. This place is definitely worth becoming a regular for! They also offer a deal of buying eight coffees I think and get one free

I consider myself a pretty patient person for the most part. However, that flew out the window in this situation. I needed to get my car wash and I heard good things about this place, so I decided to try it. I pulled up and there was 3 choices to choose from and I wanted to know the difference between "the works" and "the vip" since there was a $6 difference in price. The guy literally said, " your dashboard is shiny" I laughed and he said he was serious. oookkkkkkk weird. So then I said I really want my car vacuumed and trash cleaned out and asked which one I should get and that I was willing to pay extra.. he said "the works" is fine because as you can see on the sign it says vacuum. RUDE.  So I got my car and it was shiny and smelled nice but there was still trash and it looked it they barely put a vacuum near it. I kindly asked for them to vacuum and he took my car for 2 minutes and THERE WAS STILL TRASH and ughhh so annoying, I got in my car and said see ya could of done this myself.   Never going back there again. Never.

My honey and I have been frequenting 5th and wine for the past couple months and love it. We have yet to actually sit at a table because we are scared to leave our great bartender. If you ever have the chance go, go just to meet Steve. He is awesome. Very friendly and informative about wines and the menu. He is also pretty good to look at :) I'm just getting into wine and he has been a fabulous guide and always gives great suggestions. I also have to eat gluten free now and he was extremely helpful! The steak was amazing and my honey loves all the bruschetta including the hummus one. I do not like the hummus one though. We enjoy this place and plan to keep coming back!

I live down the street and LOVE this place. So glad to have a cozy coffee place nearby. My favorite is the pesto breakfast sandwich and I get it on a bed of spinach instead of the roll...AMAZING and only 4.50. My other fav is the java mocha smoothie which has nutella and other goodies in it. I have not tried the lunch items yer but Im sure they are equally as good.
