Okay so we had an awesome Yelp event here tonight! I thought the service was superb! I thought the drinks were great! I thought the party favors were a hit! Just a note on the food... it was buffet style & I enjoyed all of it! I especially loved the corn tamales... they were spectacular! Cheesy, Creamy, and Corny.... just like me! LOL =) I loved the atmosphere... there was a lot of old town feel & history here! You should stop by & pay a visit. Nice going Aunt Chilada's, you know how to throw a party... real live donkey & all!

I showed up at 5:40PM with a closing time for them of 6PM with an almost flat tire (perpetrator? You ask - screw!). I felt bad & told the guy they could just patch & I would come back in the morning - he said we don't care what time it is, we take customers until closing, no matter what the problem! I was already impressed (even though I'm smart enough to realize it's about business & the almighty dollar & bottom line). They didn't have to see me & I was grateful that they did! Unbeknownst to me, I was riding on 4 bald tires - clear to see - and I needed replacements. They handled it with efficiency & precision, getting it done by 6:30pm. I had already called my husband who was on his way to meet for dinner because I thought surely it would take longer, but alas the Cardinal game was on & they know how to get it done to get home to their personal lives. Needless to say we went for dinner at one our other fav's, Guru Palace across the street, so it all worked out! Now me and my car are riding like a dream thanks to them! Cody & Preston? & whoever the guy was who put my tires on were courteous & fun & now have my business in the future. Great job guys! Thanks =)

Wow! This is a prime example of why you can't always trust 4 stars on Yelp. (Sad face) I have seen a Groupon for this place multiple times and have been curious about the quality since their reviews on here seem to be great. We went during early lunch hour time, was helped promptly at the order counter, was excited to see the full menu & our mouths started watering thinking about this special caloric treat we were about to indulge in. And..... then the let downs started. No soy sauce, just some kind of mix that seemed teriyaki-ish, but whatever, who needs that sodium bottle anyway. Food came out relatively quickly EXCEPT the side order of lau lau which is what we were most excited about, it was delivered to us after we were done with our other plates. We gave the benefit of the doubt because this is a slow cooked item & we thought they were putting love into it... NOT! It was sooooo disgusting, if you've ever had real lau lau, you would understand how horribly prepared this was. After we worked our way through the dried banana leaf portion, we made it to the treasure... NOPE! The leaf was extremely bitter, filled (using the term loosely) with 2 large pieces of fat globules, a few (meaning 3) strips of what seemed to be dried jerky like pork substance. Enough on that, I'm getting upset again just typing it. The Mac salad with no potato, huh? tasted like orange zest & was low on flavor. The Kalbi ribs were so chewy I had to spit some bites into my napkin because I was going to get lock jaw trying to process it. My better half got the chicken katsu & it was just alright.  Now I have eaten at Ono & thought that was passable but do not choose to eat there, but I would eat there any day in comparison to here. End note, if you've been to Hawaii, then you know what authentic flavors are, if you are looking for the real deal, go to Aloha Kitchen. They know what they are doing, it's delicious and less expensive and so much better quality! Was that too harsh? I really dislike wasting hard earned money.

Sorry about the length but thought all was pertinent for an accurate review.  GREAT FRESH MEXICAN SEAFOOD!! We got a tip from my husbands coworker to try this place out. We went the same day because we were very excited to try some fresh seafood. It is in a location that could make some get a little uneasy... I will explain. We walked in & immediately saw that EVERYONE had a large abundance of shrimp on their plates in all different styles. One of the waitresses signaled for us to find a seat. They brought chips & salsa as soon as we sat down. We started off with drinks... my husband had the margarita which was large & tasty, and I had a pina colada which was good. When we looked over the menu we wanted to order everything! They had pictures & it all looked delicious! He ordered a fish plate with rice & salad. It was a large piece of flounder covered with a cream sauce filled with shrimp & octopus... Wow! Very good! I decided on the shrimp salad with avocado. I have this thing with wanting my salads chopped for easier eating & I was happy to see it came chopped!! except the shrimp of course - those were whole, fresh & cooked perfectly. It had what seemed like an endless amount of avocado - impressive! I also got a fish taco a la carte - it was deep fried (all right by me) and then they give you your own squeeze bottles full of sauces to top it off yourself which I thought was ideal. It was all great! Did I mention our food came out lightening fast? It was only a matter of minutes- less than 5 for sure!  I don't want to sugar coat the atmosphere... there was a guy who came in to get some relief from the hot concrete he apparently called home. There was a nice patron who bought him a beer & maybe some food - didn't stick around long enough to see that- but that patrons brother got up to stop him because he said the restaurant didn't want him there! It caused a minor scene, but the brother did not win... the guy sat drinking his cold beer - that made us feel good to know there were good people willing to step out & do a good deed!! The situation didn't really bother us at all. Then there was a young (young!) boy who came in that was peddling for money & who you could tell was sadly hooked on serious drugs. He did score a small donation before he was asked to leave & did so without incident. My husband wanted to kidnap him & get him some help because he was very young & it was a hard truth to ignore, but we ended up just hoping the best for him. Very sad. Bottom line- those were minor occurrences in a room full of ordinary people. That is my story about my trip to Restaurant Sinaloa! All in all, we left there saying we can't wait to return!!! This place is about food & if you can overlook the location & some peoples battle with life, it is a must try!

Wow, I'm impressed! Years ago the past owner was one of my patients & we visited Nello's every so often & ALWAYS enjoyed it, but I lost touch with it.... I will not do that again! We stopped by on a fluke today because my husband was in the mood for pizza & there is no doubt about it - Nello's delivers! (no pun intended) I have known the food is great but today we received Superb service from our bartender Nick! From the moment we sat down it was like he was reading our minds... No questions asked just AWESOME customer service! Definitely want to mention since we are beer fans, that they have a nice selection on tap & you can't beat the price. Great Happy Hour Prices on Pitchers! My hiatus is over & we will definitely be back! Oh and they have a fantastic Napkin Artist - that's right I said Napkin Artist! Go check it out - it's pretty cool! Thanks Nello's (& Nick)!

We took our little girl back for her grooming maintenance today. Same gal cut her, but this time we gave some slight pre-instructions/requests AND they listened! She looked great & we were once again happy with Aardbark Grooming & would now recommend them. It seems like with any good relationship.... communication was the key! Thanks - that deserves an upgraded rating! Yay :)

We usually go for breakfast, but wow, dinner is outstanding! (And today we went to Liberty Market for both... LOL) It can be pricey & you will spend a pretty penny on any of the specials they have, but we do it every time because it is so worth it!!! When Chef Dave puts a special on the menu, you can be certain that it will be full of flavor & amazing! I have to say, he has perfected the soup du jour-it has been delicious no matter which one we try. Highly recommend dining here =)

There are not enough great things I can say about this office. Dr. Lundgren is awesome! I have been a faithful patient since 2002 and would not dream of going anywhere else for my chiropractic care. Dr. Lundgren is extremely knowledgeable in many areas of the body not just bones... he looks at the total picture. He listens to his patients and never gives up in finding a solution to your specific problem. He is confident and caring! His team is very helpful, friendly & compassionate. He has had very little change in his staff, even those employees who leave, have come back to work for him again... that says a lot! Whatever your circumstance may be, if you are looking for a well rounded, extraordinary chiropractor, please call Lundgren Chiropractic. He has also just added a pain doctor and has expanded his practice into pain management as well.   After reviewing my review (haha), I realize it sounds like a pitch or that I work for him, but I can assure you that is not the case, I am just a loyal patron who knows a good thing when I find it!

LOVE LOVE LOVE the bean & cheese burritos! Just made a phone order for pick up to try it "with sauce" per most Yelpers recommendations... can't wait! Fish tacos are good. Tacos are street taco size, and they pack a lot of flavor- Delish. The place is not special but the food is =)

Solid 3-1/2+ stars. 'Cheers' kind of feeling in this place. Friendly service. Great for watching UFC fights! Nice beer selection. Good people watching. Check-in offer is great except for the fact that you REALLY have to hate AC/DC. (wink wink) Food has its ons & offs but they get creative with the Specials menu & offer some good food. Clean environment. We are regulars on fight nights.

we went back - held our groupon coupon until it was time to pay. I'm not saying that is what got us better service because I don't believe that to be the truth. BUT this visit was very different from our last! It was great from the beginning to the end. We had an awesome waiter who was perfectly attentive. He did a great job & gave us great service! The food was well cooked, a bit salty, but delicious! I have changed my mind about Cowboy Ciao & would be willing to go back again. Still rave about the Mushroom Pan Fry!! Good save this time! Thx for the improved service, much appreciated - upgraded one star  :)

You definitely won't go hungry here!! The atmosphere was nice. The people were even nicer. It can be casual but you might want to put on something a little more special to dine here, plus it makes you feel good to dress up. The food was outstanding! The value to portion ratio at dinner is insane, I suggest fasting before eating here. You will get two large meals out of it. I was so hoping to try dessert after Yelps recommendations but I will have to control myself next time to fit that in. The bread is delivered to your table shortly after coming out of the oven & is warm & delicious. There were a few large groups that had laughter oozing from the tables which made it a fun experience. We can't wait to go again!

* SORRY NO RE-ENTRY * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY *  I can't believe that no one has commented on this very important note (totally worth mentioning again if I didn't see it)! We were 1st timers (our mistake, I guess, but one that should be duly noted) & didn't see the INSIDE "signage" before stepping through the gates of hell...  * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY *  We had to take off our shoes for some bullshit pat down. Whatever. Cockroaches all over the place. Gross. Bathroom disgusting. Gross. Beer expensive. Whatever. One time run on credit card, so must open a tab or bring lots of cash or get banged at the ATM. Whatever. No seating. Fine. Security hopped on hopes of "catching" you. Whatever. Shitty pizza offered. Whatever. Doors opening & show starting are NOT the same thing. Whatever. Limited parking. Whatever. Size inside. Not bad. Outside patio. Not bad. 3 bars. Not bad. But let me re-state the shittiest thing again... Once you're in, you can't leave!  * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY *  We were excited to see Steel Pulse, who were awesome BTW, but were very let down with all the 'RULES' at this place... and we are hoping that we don't have to go back there to see another great band. We can appreciate grunge, but try again Marquee Theatre.  * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY * SORRY NO RE-ENTRY *

Mmmmmmm Mmmmm Mmm........ so good! I was skeptical about mach meats, but was pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were prepared. We ordered a couple of apps & 2 bowls to try. The apps were good, but my drunken mushroom "chicken" was executed beautifully! The best part? The "TSoynami Clunky Monkey" was a dessert that I couldn't stop moaning after every bite! Was that TMI?? Just imagine... Soy Ice Cream mixed with chunks of bananas, pecans, and chocolate drizzled throughout. Even if you eat too much and think you don't have room... don't miss this chance - make room!! You won't be sorry.  Overall? Excellent!  I am a fan and can't wait to try more on the menu!

5 STAR! 5 STAR! 5 STAR! Wow... What else can I say? If you haven't been to Cafe ZuZu - what are you waiting for? I was sorry it took me so long to get there!!  The amazing, talented Chef Sean created wonders on a plate... Seared Ahi - Delicious Truffled Grilled Cheese - Outstanding Asian Pear Salad - Perfection (That was course #1) Brussel Sprouts Au Gratin - Mmmmm Crab Cakes over Cheesy Grits - Speechless Lamb Sausage - Oh so good Mussels - Seriously the BEST I've ever had (anywhere)!!  (That was course #2) Tropical Iced Tea w/Fresh Mint & a side of Simple Syrup -  Refreshing (Could not fit another course in... will have to go back for dessert!)  Well, enough about the food, let's move on to the atmosphere. Very cool, very chic, very retro (50's). We could not stop thinking & talking of ideas on how to bring more people here, i.e., family, friends, large gatherings, work parties, etc. We want to share the feeling & the fabulous food we enjoyed here. Not to mention, they try to source local, have fresh herb garden right outside the kitchens back door, and mostly made from scratch! The service was personable & friendly! And we hear they have a great happy hour during the week, which we will definitely be back for!  The team that put life back into the Hotel Valley Ho & Cafe ZuZu is genius! The place is simply impressive. A gem tucked away that should be admired, enjoyed & taken to the next level!   GO NOW! =)

Saw Here Lies Jeremy Troy for date night with my husband. I love the Hale Centre Theatre! It's a very intimate setting for a play, up close & personal. That specific play itself was a comedy & hilariously entertaining! I have seen other plays there & recommend the experience. Plan it.... it's fun! You can reserve tickets/seats online at no extra charge. Plus there are a lot of great places to eat in a very short walking distance... Joe's BBQ, Liberty Market, and Oreganos. Liberty's our favorite, Joe's is good, and Oreganos is always very packed ~ not sure if they accept reservations, but would recommend that long before the curtains open. Enjoy!

Okay - so let's start this off right... We went to see Ziggy Marley concert there last night & the music/entertainment was amazing!!  Okay - on to the rest... 1st of all the parking for this event was ridiculous! Only saw one staffer that finally closed a gate & was there to tell people to move on past a full parking lot, but all other areas were a ghost town with no direction, no communication on where else to park. We were all driving around like crazy people. You would think with the amount of money made from ticket sales, they would be able to afford to put a little more into an event like this. Guess not!?!   Let's head inside... only accepts cash at the outside bar - again ridiculous! Then when we moseyed on over to the inside bar (Radio Bar) - what horrible service, actually that's not all true because we never got service! We were patient, held out hand graciously, we tried just to say what we wanted in hopes that one of only 3 bartenders would pay attention, but there was blatant ignoring going on & we were in the front, on the bar... Needless to say - we decided that we would get faster service at our Home Bar inside our kitchen 35 minutes away - so we left & it was a great decision to finish with a nightcap on our couch talking about the evenings awesome Ziggy Marley Entertainment!  Fort McDowell Casino you have some work to do!!

Dr. Madder and his team are awesome! I use to work in the Dental field so I know what I speak of. They are friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, thorough, and caring from the front desk to the back office and most of all, Dr. Madder. He is gentle and informative. Their office is very nice, clean, and has a calming atmosphere, which is important during such a personal and sometimes scary necessity of the dreaded dental visit. They also offer Nitrous ("laughing gas"), which is a huge plus for those of us who need a little help taking the edge off! I would highly recommend their office for you and your family's dental needs. Thanks to them for taking great care of mine!

We love watching Eight Arizona late at night when in bed (TMI?) - it has extremely interesting, educational & captivating shows on. It's not good when you are trying to fall asleep but you can't because what they are broadcasting is way more interesting than your dreams could possibly be... Thanks PBS! Love it & keep up the good work!

We just happened upon this cafe via our GPS & wow were we pleasantly surprised!! My husband being from SF & my many trips there has taught me a lot about the mediocre coffee offered here in town. When I walked into Solo Cafe... it was like I had ventured on a trip to a cozy, special little place tucked away in the streets of San Francisco! The vibe was cool, the decor was great, the service was personal & the coffee was an awesome change from the usual Starbucks. It just felt good!! The ambiance alone won me over. We are excited to make this a regular weekend trip! Great job going Solo!!!

I have been a member here for a little less than a year. We go about 2-3x a week & love it! We bought the year pass because it was cheaper that way & we wanted to be more committed than the daily or monthly pass. I have been a member at other gyms but not as impressed as I am with the atmosphere here at Tumbleweed. It has an indoor track to get out of the AZ heat. The gym also offers racquetball which is a fun alternative to workout. They offer an array of classes (Zumba, Yoga, Pilates, Core Conditioning, etc)  which are included in your membership!!!!. You can't find those options for the same rate anywhere else that I know of. The people are professional & friendly - there is no haggling over membership price, commitment, or being approached by personal trainers. On that note, they do not have any personal trainers, which if you are someone who needs motivation or accountability, this probably wouldn't be the place for you. But for the price & option of the daily pass - you could bring a workout buddy anytime!!!  The other side to joining a Rec Center is that you are supporting your city & giving back to the community - not supporting some big money hungry corporation!   Check it out!!!

We tried platters... very pleased with both. We especially liked the feta cheese on our salads - it was the most creamy delicious feta cheese I've ever had... they said it was from Bulgaria... mmm mmm mmm yummmmmy! Lamb was a little overcooked for medium rare, but didn't take away points for that because it was still fabulous. Definitely will return for more!  P.S. A little hard to find.

So almost 1 year later, we return. And I wonder why it took me so long. The service is great, non pretentious, friendly, informative & just really nice. The food is impressive. Not too much, not too little, just right in every aspect... cooking, presentation, portion, etc. When you walk out of somewhere & the 1st thing you think is.... have I Yelped this place? - You know that it's really made a mark on your feelings, your thoughts, your need to share with the world the information of a place that is getting it right! It is in the back or side of a strip mall (surprise - welcome to AZ), but when you walk in you are transported to a quaint, welcoming atmosphere, including the patio area. Definitely a hidden gem that I wouldn't pass up!

THE ONLY THINGS THAT SAVED THIS FROM BEING A ONE-STAR IS THE BEER WE GOT TO TRY & THE WAITER! Everything else was a definitely a one-star! Let's start with the "clam chowder" - it was liquefied mashed potatoes with a couple of clam pieces thrown in. Next came the "caprese salad" - it was 3 cherry tomatoes uncut, 3 small mozzarella balls uncut, lots of crustini, balsamic sprinkled with dry basil & side salad w/dressing... all on a 7 inch plate for $8. Then came the main sandwich dishes: rib-eye steak with leek fondue on a ciabatta ordered medium rare - came on wheat french bread, 3 small pieces of dry, well-done SIRLOIN steak, the sauce was absorbed into the bread & nothing else. 2nd plate was a veggie sandwich - which wasn't bad, we split it as the steak sandwich was not good. Now let's talk about the fries, partially uncooked, extremely oily, wilted, have to say they looked good but were completely inedible!! So we came here on a Groupon deal & when it was time to pay - the bartender girl shorted us $6 & called it a Deal Chicken. I was polite in confronting her and she was extremely rude in her response. She said the computer would not let her discount alcohol. I told her the Groupon did not exclude alcohol therefore she should apply our entire discount. She was angry & said she would talk to manager. Well, obviously he gave us what was RIGHT! She didn't even look at me when she handed me the new bill.   Now let's talk about the good things... our waiter Cord, oh what a saving grace at this place, we wished he would find a more promising job! We left him a higher than average tip to show him that we appreciated his service! Also we tried a beer that we have been curious about, Session beer (light & dark)- it was surprisingly tasty & a nice find. We will be purchasing that in the future!  I feel bad about a dying business, but sometimes you should let dead dogs lie..... or bury them! Ugh, hate to say it, but I think this place's time is limited. Sad.

We stumbled upon this pizza place while walking around downtown waiting for The Australian Pink Floyd show (BTW-they're amazing) to start. We were intrigued by the Organic tomato sauce sign & the fact that they had wheat dough. It was an absolute a delight! The thin pizza crust was great & the choices for interesting pizzas/toppings makes it a fun experiment & treat! The topper to the experience is that they had some (only a few, but) good choices of beer on tap & offered a great deal on ordering a pitcher vs an individual glass! It was exactly what we were looking for when we ventured out to find something new & tasty!! Only wish we lived closer :(

Great craft beer selection! Liked our waitress, Theresa, seems to be a good place with good people & friendly staff. The wings were pretty tasty (try the "Crazy" Bbq), we want to try them grilled also. Liked the variety of ways you can order your wings, nice touch. We had a greek quesadilla too, it was good, meat was tender, but could be improved slightly (maybe add some feta cheese?) They have lots of TV's so we expect it to be a good place to watch some events. (No UFC though - too bad!) We were really impressed with the CRAFT BEER & the always rotating menu - keeps things fresh & us wanting to come back for more!! So far, I'm a fan!

Hula's Modern Tiki is awesome! We went there for brunch on Sunday morning and we have zero complaints. Lets start with the all day happy hour on Saturday and Sunday.... who can be disappointed with $2.00 mimosas? They were in a small flute which went down quite quick and easy, then we went for the house made bloody mary - simply delicious!! The food was great... ahi eggs benedict & the hula hangover was what we finally decided on, but can't wait to go back to try the next thing on the menu! We were also excited to see it was on the metro-lightrail route. The architecture was cool and it was a beautiful day to sit out on the patio. We couldn't stop talking about it the rest of the day... it was yummy and a delightful experience! We highly recommend it :)

We took our friends out to dinner & chose this place off of yelp reviews. We were excited when we looked at the website promising belly dancing and live music and a Lamb Shank that falls off the bone. So the Lamb Shank lived up to the hype, but we were the only customers there for most of our visit, which actually made it kind of nice :) and no live entertainment. So we laughed out loud & enjoyed our friends.  We tried the Quail hummus... delicious! I had the fattoush salad... the taste was good but the size of the veggies was not appealing to my mouth, I would prefer a more chopped friendly salad. My friends were happy with their choices which I tried & all the food was at a high standard of preparation. The authentic beer selection was terrible.  The service was personable, very authentic & spicy ;) I liked the feel of the place, the owner was there & checked on us - he gave us coupons for the buffet & we are excited to go back for more. He also explained that they were packed through the holidays & decided to give the live entertainment some time off, but encouraged us to come back to check it out. Woohoo!  All in all, nice find!!

I needed my annual eye exam and decided to try Focused on Eyes. I'm happy I did! It was a pleasant experience. I didn't have to wait to be seen, they were prompt in all areas, including reception area, and fitting of new glasses. Dr. Lucas gave me an extensive eye exam, answered all my questions and concerns and was very nice and professional. My eyes aren't too bad but in my aging process things are changing at a rapid pace and I found a place that I can feel confident in taking care of my eyesight and glasses needs for years to come! Thanks to Dr. Lucas and her team!

Okay, so many of you have had the experience of getting your bluh.da (blood) drawn and have to wait in those crappy offices for an unknown amount of hours. Well, I was mixed about giving this review because then you all would go there & change it's fabulous aura! But I just had to give props to the two girls who work there... Rea and I'm sorry I didn't get the other girls name, but they ROCK-N-ROLL at their jobs!! It's always just the two of them & I have never waited more than 30 min. and then they are really sorry for that. Seriously, they are awesome! The office is carpeted & nicely decorated... not all sterile & cold. Thank you Sonora Quest for having this diamond in the rough!  You Go Girls :)

okay.... so this is my 1st review as a yelper & unfortunately it is not a good one - I felt compelled to write this one asap!   I work around the gilbert/baseline area & was excited to see a new taqueria opening up! I went today for the 1st time & was sorely disappointed. At 1st I thought "this is going to be awesome" because it was very busy and the food coming out looked good. I ordered my food to go so didn't make my discovery until I was back at the office! I ordered a combo plate with a fish taco & rice/beans. The beans were okay, but the rice bland. My 1st bite into the fish taco had a sweet flavor - completely not what I was expecting! I have to say the fish itself wasn't bad, it was grilled & not breaded... but with the sweet sauce - it wasn't very good. Here's the worst part... I also ordered a green corn tamale on the side- DON'T GET IT!! It was very dry & 1/2 of it was inedible! The salsas were okay - didn't try any of their specialty salsas but was intrigued. It is well overpriced for the quality of food I received!!  So needless to say.... I may go back to try something else, maybe I ordered the wrong things? If it's better I will update my review.   Sorry Tia, but so far.... no bueno!!

Dana.Dana.Dana... you can't say anything about Emerge Acupuncture without mentioning the Star of the Show! She is impressive all the way around. Her knowledge is endless, her commitment to her clients is inspiring, her bedside manner is amazing, and not to mention her ability to touch the body & soul deeply. She has a very calm, comforting, and caring demeanor which is priceless when you are about to get stuck with needles or the ever-odd cupping procedure. I would recommend her (and have)  to anyone searching out acupuncture.

I should start by saying I'm not a big fan of BBQ. The bar service was friendly & personable. The beers weren't great. But the food at Famous Dave's is just okay. It's not too bad & it's not too good. The corn fritters say there is heat in them, but there's not. The southern rib basket was pretty good - the meat was tender & we like the pickles & onions that come with it. The beans are okay. The boneless wings were good & we liked that they came w/blue cheese w/o even asking. Really nothing to write home about & probably won't be back unless there isn't another option available or we're really hungry & it smells good when we walk by. That's about it.

Went to my first UYE (thanks Jim & Audrey!) & enjoyed meeting other yelpers, who gave some great insight to their experiences & reviews.   It was a great time & the food was great too! I had my introduction to fried matzo balls & potato pancakes, um..... both were awesome! Who knew that applesauce & sour cream would be so good together as a topping, obviously someone did & they were right. If you've never had matzo ball chicken soup, I suggest you try it. Note: it's the best when you are feeling under the weather! Also tried Rugulach - don't even know how to pronounce that correctly, but it's very similar to Baklava, so if you like that you won't be disappointed & it comes in a variety of flavors. I have to say I like this Chompies better than the one in Tempe for a number of reasons.... but mainly because it's so much closer to my house! Lol :)  Give it a whirl, you won't be sorry, and if you're not sure about what to get - ask your server - they are very friendly & informative! Good job tonight with such a big group & thanks for the extras!!  *****OH YEAH... BTW - THE GOOGLE MAP ADDRESS ON HERE IS WRONG - IT PUTS YOU IN SOME FAR AWAY NEIGHBORHOOD. THE DELI IS RIGHT BEHIND THE CHANDLER MALL. IN THE SPORTS AUTHORITY, BED BATH & BEYOND, DSW, ETC. PARKING LOT. JUST FYI*****

All I can say is if you have an A/C or heating problem.... like their name, you can really trust this company! I used them for my own services. I was referred by SRP during some promotion for annual check ups of your system. On that trip I bought an electric timer thermostat, was thankful to have them recommend it & install it on the same visit. Then in the middle of a cold winter my unit gave out.... kaput, nada, nothing, DEAD! Well, I had to get a couple of estimates before going with such an expensive repair. Trustworthy came out the winner, gave me a top of the line unit for a good price in comparison. (replacing your A/C-heater unit is not cheap!!) Then my friends had a problem at the beginning of an AZ summer - yikes! I referred them to Trustworthy who was at their house w/in hours/for approx 5 hours & fixed their problem for under $300 when they thought they would be paying thousands to replace an old unit. Needless to say they were impressed & extremely thankful & instantly became new loyal referring customers like myself! They are honest, hard working & I would vouch for them any day!

I have been going to this Discount Tire for years & have never been disappointed. I just got a set of Perelli tires on their recommendation & am very happy with them. They have consistent, knowledgeable, friendly & as their name states... discounted service. I have tried other places for my son's car but nothing compares to their bang for the buck. They take competitors coupon deals if you ask or mention them and match it. You can't beat that, so give them a try!

Went here with a Groupon for the 1st time but they were having some kind of special event w/live music & singing... it was very entertaining because the place was so small, they walked around while you're eating & it created an authentic atmosphere. They had a packed house! Unfortunately, they were not accepting groupons that night (had a sign posted) but we drove all that way & was intrigued with what was happening there. We ordered, ate & left quite satisfied that we would be back again to enjoy our groupon.   Fast forward a few months... went back with the groupon. Atmosphere was much different this time.... Not so busy, but we were thankful that we could try out the place with less distraction so we could concentrate on the food. We were quite impressed again! Love the flavor of the food... it is a little salty but extremely tasty. The Lomo Saltado de Carne is absolutely scrumptious! The taste seem to resemble some german flavors (sounds weird, I know) that brought nostalgia to me & my husband with thoughts of happy times growing up. Him with his grandmothers cooking & me with years spent overseas. Needless to say - yum, yum, yum!! We also had the Picante de Mariscos... has a little kick to it & delicious as well. Drink menu is limited. Portions are on the small side but we have not left hungry yet.  The staff, both times, were very friendly & helpful with decision making for people who were unfamiliar with the food preparation. We enjoyed both visits & have already discussed our excitement to go back for more. We would love this place to succeed!

Did you ever say you wished you had a J-Lo butt? Then read on...  I might be a little bias being 1/2 Puerto Rican, but you know you are at the right place when you walk in and see that countries native people eating there. If you want a real treat and have never had Puerto Rican food, please go to Millie's and try it. It is a Mom & Pop place for sure -you will see Millie herself right behind the counter cookin' your food like you were sitting in her kitchen while her husband is taking your order. The price is definitely right! We practically had the entire menu for $40. Don't be fooled by the ambiance... tiny dining room, fold out tables & chairs, plastic ware & cups with ice from an ice chest propped up on a stool. The food is where the money is!! BTW- cash only, so be prepared. Open Thurs-Sun for lunch & dinner (11am-8pm).  Here are some highlights if you're not familiar: Tostones... fried & salted plantains - get the garlic side dip Pasteles... pork inside green banana (like a tamale, but better) Amarillos... sweet fried banana Arroz con Gandules... yellow rice w/beans and last but NOT least (here's where the J-Lo butt comes in) Mofongo w/a side of pork - it is hard to describe but easy to remember! It is plantain w/crispy fried pork formed into a ball of joy! And the sides of pork that they give are the most tender juicy pork I've ever had. This is a must try item! But not for the faint of heart - literally.   "Bottom" line is I would eat here everyday if I could afford new clothes.  P.S. I read someone else's review that stated that the Flan was not made there. Just FYI, Millie is the Flan Lady & makes the flan right there in that same kitchen. The only problem is that she makes it for restaurants valley wide & so in that mass production - it loses some of it's homemade quality. It is still good though & she makes a mean pastry. Try 'em!

The lesson learned here... You can't always trust 4 stars! So I'm going to take it down a notch. We only tried the breakfast burrito (no meat diet at the moment) so my review of the food may be off as far as flavor but you can do a lot with beans, eggs, cheese & potatoes and they just didn't. Not to mention, we waited over 20 Minutes for our order of 2 burritos! They did apologize & offer free soft drinks, but come on people. Maybe they were dealing with the cockroach that had scurried across the floor? Or the obviously under-age worker who checked us out (10-11 year old boy) We won't be eating here again!

Great homemade chorizo! Non-pretentious place. Not a great location, but were steadily busy. My husbands chicken burrito plate with green sauce was freakin delicious! We can't wait to try more stuff. I was excited to see they had green chile cheese corn tamales, it's been a while since I had a good one, so high hopes to get my chompers on those. A little pricey on the dozen tamales ($18.99) but must be good, right? We were there early so they didn't have the chips made for the day, but their salsas packed a lot of flavor. Nice people, good food, solid place!

So we just went here to see our friends art exhibit. (who is showing the entire month of June - you must go see Jeremy Mcmurtry's display & purchase some of his cool art pieces) Shameless plug for a friend! But on to the Film Bar... cool place, nice vibe & had good beer offerings. We were there on 1st Friday & when I checked in on Yelp they had a discount 2 for 1 tap beer... when I showed the bartender she said they normally don't give those discounts on 1st Fridays but she would honor it for us since it was our 1st time (& I think the whole Yelp review played a part), but either way we thought it was a cool thing to do. We only visited with friends & enjoyed the atmosphere - we did not take part in film watching. However, we are excited & looking forward to seeing some independent films here, we had no idea a venue like this existed & are stoked to enjoy some fine art sometime soon! I'll be back to tell you more then.

We found this restaurant through Yelp & it had a good rating but mixed reviews, so we ventured there with no expectations... WE WERE PLEASANTLY SATISFIED! The Jalapeno Poppers with crab were some of the best poppers I've EVER had... they are a must try! There weren't many patrons, at one point we were the only ones there at about 5pm on a Friday evening, that could have been a concern being a Sushi place, but the food/fish was fresh & DELICIOUS. We have it on our list of must go again. The service was excellent! Thank you! (They are currently offering 20% off all day Happy Hour on Sushi ROLLS only)

BoomBozz is spectacular! Great food, great execution, great service! The beer is good, my husband likes their selection more than I do, but trust me when I say, I can find a cold one to put down - nooooo problem! I like less hoppy beers & to most who enjoy the finer selections of beer would think I was crazy, so for you beer lovers, you are sure to be satisfied. Just a few recommendations - try the portabello sticks, and any pizza (they do it nice on wheat crust), and the veggie sandwich is awesome. Great prices on social hour but we would eat there any time of the day!  Thanks BoomBozz & here's to wishing you much success! ~Cheers

So, unfortunately, last time we ordered from BoomBozz, it was not good... maybe it was a bad night, but I have to update my thoughts to be honest.  The wheat crust was horrible! It was like cardboard. Very flat & not at all pleasing to the palate. The Portabella 1/2 of our pizza at least made up for flavor, but the fajita 1/2 was very plain tasting. We were very sad & marked it up to a new chef or something, but very discouraged to try again. We have liked it so much in the past, that we will be willing to go again, but after that experience, it isn't very high on our list.  They have digressed.  Sorry.

Okay, since my latest review, I was contacted by the manager who expressed concern on my bad experience. Fran wanted to make sure they had the opportunity to make it right. I was impressed! I do want to say that even if the food sometimes needs a little sumptin sumptin, the customer service is Great and always has been! I give them superb credit for that & the ambiance is nice too. We went back for another try & we were satisfied. I definitely think you should stick with the thin or traditional crust, it was better. Also a note to update a previous review - they no longer have the Portobello Steak Sticks, not sure why, maybe a cost thing, but they were delicious and I will miss them! Another cool note that should be said because it can't be said about most places with an outdoor patio - they do not allow smoking in the patio dining area, which is such a refreshing change. It's nice to be able to enjoy the great Arizona weather this time of year. Thanks for that!  Final words... BoomBozz is on the top of our list again

I'm a big fan! Postino's has the market on Bruschetta... it is scrumptiously delicious! I have tried their salads, sandwiches, desserts and all were excellent. And the Butcher Block was amazing! They also have the market on the best pitcher price for great beer, not just domestics, crafts as well for only $5 until 5pm... what a steal! Also on Monday & Tuesday nights they have a House bottle of vino & an order of Bruschetta for only $20, another great deal. Atmosphere is nice, relaxed and fun. Service has been good, very friendly & knowledgable. It can get very busy and have a long wait but if you plan ahead, you will be eating and drinking in no time at all... Totally worth it!

So far so good. We went for happy hour & ordered almost everything on HH menu except for brussels sprouts & only because we were full from the other four things we ordered already. Very different & very delicious! We did find multiple items to be slightly over-salted but it did not take away from the dish. We can't wait to return to try other menu items. Highly recommend!

We were pleasantly surprised with the food & drinks here. The chicken fried steak was delish! But the biscuits and gravy were not good enough to order again but were good enough to eat once. We were intrigued by the rest of menu & will definitely be back. The En Fuego Bloody Mary was great & spicy, just the way my husband likes it & who doesn't like bacon?! We would suggest to them though to keep the bacon as one piece instead of crumbling it on top of the drink- as soon as you tried to eat it, it sank - booooo! They have many nice hangover drinks to choose from so we will definitely be back for those too!

Came here because they left a flyer on our front door, that is not usually a tactic that impresses me, but after reviewing the menu I was intrigued. When we walked in we were the only customers there which can be a bad sign but it is their "grand opening" time so we decided to stay. Owner/chef very politely offered us a table, we sat, we enjoyed, we will come again. Started with crab puffs (light, crispy, delicious), then on to the salted fish & chicken fried rice (simple but yummy), and even though they have an extensive menu we special ordered noodles (tasty and perfectly spicy). We were impressed with the nice service & wish them great success!!

Great craft beer!! We've been here a few times now & will continue to support this awesome establishment on a regular basis! We love craft beer & they have an extremely small set up, which is a big draw for us. They only serve their crafts (and tea, I think) so don't go lookin' for Bud, Coors or any other watery substance... This place is special & so is the love they put into their beer! It is not for the weak hearted, it's real beer with extraordinary tastes. Sometimes they have more choices than others & that's part of the fun... You never know what you're gonna get!  They have a decent menu with delicious burgers. Yay for the guys who were successful in seeing their vision become a tangible & superb reality for us!! Btw, there are many who feel this way, so it does get crowded & loud & you might have to wait if you don't go early. They also have a long bar type table that is neat, you sit intimately with strangers which can be fun & interesting if you want to chat up new friends or just eavesdrop, hee hee. Woohoo, this really is as good as it gets!! :)  Go there & partake in the joy of AZ Wilderness Brewing Co. "Don't feed the beard" Love it!

The only reason this place is getting 2stars is for the beer SELECTION, not the prices. And as all the other Yelpers, we so wanted to love this place, but just can't. My husband doesn't like it when he knows I'm going to give a bad review because he feels bad for them, BUT the whole point is to help these people figure it out! During our visit, we decided pretty quickly that we probably would not be coming back, so hopefully these reviews are taken seriously & with consideration. I will give the atmosphere and decor a 4 star, it's cute and has a nice set up with a lot of potential. And here comes the big but again, BUT you can't serve overpriced crappy food with great beer. You can't have a team that doesn't know anything about your great beer selection & brings you the wrong samplers. You can't have them correcting you multiple times on how to pronounce a beer if they get it wrong!! You can't have them give you the wrong tables check at the end of service. You can't have them wipe down a wet table while your seated with another wet, disgusting bar towel & then make you wait while they search for a dry one to finish the job. You just can't do any of those things & expect repeat customers. The food was bad, really bad! And when you are talking about the great beer, why would we come here if we could go right down the street to a Brewery who also has great food & beer that isn't overpriced! Let me say, we don't have a problem paying high prices for great beers or great food or great service, but when you miss on all counts, it felt like a waste of money. Perch you need to sit down with the greeters, chefs and the servers and have a pow wow, ASAP! Sorry for this BUT I just couldn't accept not writing this review. :(

Party with a paint is such a great idea and so much fun! Carole was great! My girlfriends and I went for the first time last night. We had a fabulous time!! We were concerned about the difficulty because none of us are very artsy, but it was easy to follow and all of our art turned out great (at least our moms think so, haha). Time flies by and it's a little stressful sometimes to keep up, but alas that is where the wine comes in... Keep calm and paint on! It is BYOB and they provide nice plastic wine cups or if you wanna go a little more country you can go with the red solo cup option. She also provided little complimentary dessert bites, which was a nice touch and yummy! No matter what the painting is or drink or no drink, you can be assured it is soooooo much fun! We will definitely be doing it again. Thanks Carole!
