The broth is good, the smells are incredible, and the servings are generous.  The only downside I have to this experience is that it just isn't QUITE there in terms of full pho flavor.  I tend to be overly critical of VIetnamese food in general since I always had high quality authentic food at home growing up.  I was skeptical when my co-workers suggested it.   However, good experience, good atmosphere, and a GREAT price.  Bigger plus for being close to work AND for having Vietnamese soy milk!  Oh it's a bit hard to see, but it's in a strip mall on the East side of the road next to a Mexican restaurant.

The best sushi in Chandler. Possibly in the Phoenix metro area.  Shimogamo is a quiet sushi location in a strip mall.  The interior has just a few tables and is very peaceful.  Hurry is not the name of the game here; bring a friend that you really like and have some great conversation while you enjoy the easy going but very pleasant service.  You won't taste ice on your fish here and it's one of the few places I feel comfortable eating sushi in the desert.

I walked over to Ray's when visiting nearby Thunderbird University and ended up telling everyone else at the school to walk over there for lunch!  I ordered two slices of beef & black olives, and kicked back in one of the old-school diner booths to watch the game until my food was ready.  Cozy atmosphere, quiet but not too small, with a few small TVs mounted around the place with sports on.  I got two slices & water for about $6.  I got my pizza and was pleasantly surprised.  The slices were large (think bigger than delivery pizza but not too big to hold one handed with a slight bend in the slice).  The beef was not ground beef as I expected, but slices of beef.  The taste was awesome; the beef was more like gyro beef, which lent a great flavor to the pizza.  The crust & bread was thin but soft with a slight crisp at the end.  Perfect.    If I had more time, I would have gotten a whole pizza and walked it back.  Definitely a great place to eat if you are in the Glendale area!

A group of students walked over here after class and we split 3 pizzas, spending less than $5 each for about 3 slices each I think.  I just needed to update that I am not a fan of most veggie pizzas, but the veggie pizza here was so great & filling, I actually didn't miss the meat!  The mushrooms & tomatoes were great...actually, now that I think about it, the lack of green veggies but the variety of others was what made this pizza so awesome.  As always, the staff rocks.

Nordstrom the brand gets five stars, but this location's selection and organization is sad enough to knock it down to a two.  When in Scottsdale, might as well go to Nordstrom Rack.  Let me say that my previous Nordstrom is a marvelously organized HUGE expanse of shopping with shoe sections that would fill up the entire downstairs of this one.  The clothes are beautifully arranged with niches designed more like fashion show rooms than department store space.  No attention has been given to this Nordstrom in terms of layout, which causes a circling pattern in a small space.  The clothes aren't awful, but as other reviewers have said, there is not as much variety as I have seen at other Nordstroms.  I usually rate highly based on the service & availability in the shoe department.  Other than salon shoes, I only saw one or two pairs of cute shoes, which was a huge disappointment, so I didn't even bother to test the customer service in the department.  Scottsdale marks the only time I actually have walked THROUGH Nordstrom to get to the mall.  The makeup department is still great, but the store size ruins the entire experience.

Not a vegan or a vegetarian, but I am a fan!  First note: if you are looking for this place, pay attention to the map BEFORE you get in the car.  It's in the corner of a strip mall and is VERY easy to miss.  It's just south of McKellips, for assistance.  You will see a low to the ground sign that just says GREEN.  Turn in there; the place is in the corner.  Very small, very unassuming.  I tried this out because I am lactose intolerant and decided to just try eating a vegan meal to ensure no dairy was in my food.  I got the Thai Peanut and a Soynami.    The portion was large enough that I was able to split it into two bowls when I got home.  I got my Thai Peanut with brown rice and fresh tofu.  Now, I already love tofu, and this dish was fantastic.  Absolutely one of the best stir-fry type dishes I have had with tofu.  In fact, I was surprised that 1) it was so good and 2) it was vegan.   It was the type of meal that you keep eating even though you can feel yourself getting full because it's just so good.  Ditto with the soynami.  The texture was interesting, which made it seem less watery than many soy based desserts that I get.  I got mine vanilla, with chocolate chips and sliced almonds, and it was perfect.  Another case of "I'm really full and should stop eating but hell with it, I'm already crashed out on the couch anyway"...I wish you could get a half soynami because half of the Thai Peanut + half a Soynami would be a perfect meal.   I can eat a giant steak in one sitting, but this meal made me go into couch potato food coma mood because I was just so...full...  In my return trips, I have learned not to eat the entire bowl and to pace myself, but the call of the deliciousness and the great staff keeps me coming back again and again.  I don't know if it's healthy, I don't know how they do it, but I don't care...it's delicious.  Note:  I haven't tried any of the "fake meat" items--that just sounds weird to me...so no feedback on that. The decor is a bit odd, but it's one of those quirky joints you just learn to appreciate as a contributor to the "local flavor" category. PS: They have VIMTO!  I was seriously taken aback and laughing when I first saw this, but it definitely took me back to some Middle East travels...if you love Vimto, this is your place!

Only stopped in to try a macaron. No reason to go back. Waste of money, even if the people are super nice.  I love macarons; Laduree and Maidon du Chocolat have some of my favorite flavors. I have been fortunate enough to eat them in France regularly since i was very young.  Ever since I moved to Arizona, I have been craving one again. I heard this place was good.   The macaron was not good. Not even for cake or cookie standards. It was too dense, not crispy enough on the outside, and thick instead of fluffy on the inside. The ganache was like fondant, it was so thick! In fact, I couldn't help but make a face through the first few bites, and had to throw it out. I tried the chocolate, mint chocolate, vanilla, and lemon: similar results.   If I am in the mood for a dense cake, I will buy a cake for cheaper. In addition, drink menu advertises soy milk for an extra $0.60 but when I asked only one drink could actually be made with soy milk.   Extra star because the staff was amazingly nice and I almost felt bad for how disappointing the food was.

Too boring, frosting too sweet, store too small...Sprinkles lucked out on location, because I cannot see these mediocre cupcakes thriving anywhere else.  I got a dark chocolate cupcake.  The cake was too try, the cupcake too sweet, and there was more frosting than cake.  Cupcake vote was out the window there, and isn't this the whole point?  The store was TINY.  Once I got my cupcake there was nowhere to stand to eat it without getting in the way of people ordering, so why do they bother having cocktail tables in there if there is no space to stand around them?  I will say the decor is cute.  I am off to find a better cupcake today.

If you don't have a lot of money for an amazing super romantic all-out steak dinner, at least call them for some lobster mashed potatoes to go...I PROMISE it will be the best $23 on mashed potatoes EVER!  Tucked away in what looks like a business strip across from Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, City Hall doesn't look like a steakhouse and the entrance can be hard to find (keep going down Camelback West and turn in across from Neiman).  You walk into a cozy, upscale venue that doesn't demand you be dressed to the nines.  It's equally a great place for the date of a lifetime or an upscale hangout with friends (there is a loungy area by the bar with live music).  This is the place where waiters replace dropped forks before you've reached to grab it, where they are talkative but make the best recommendations ever, and where you will stop talking because the food is just too good to slow down for conversation.  The steak speaks for itself--just order it.  I still have other favorites in the valley, but their steak is definitely in the top tier of quality.    It is the sides that totally make this place. I never thought I would like creamed corn--this place makes it southern style and I basically ended up stealing it from my husband. LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES.  These changed my world.  Seriously.  I can't even make this.  It was creamy and meaty and flavorful and enough to eat for lunch for the next two days!  I took this to go and thanked the Mastro's staff while I reheated it the next day.    This place isn't cheap, mind you.  It'll set  you back just like any high end steakhouse dinner.  So make sure you are hungry and you are ready to appreciate it.  Anytime husband wants to meet me after I'm done shopping, this is my go to place.  I absolutely love it. So much food we took enough home to feed us both for lunch the next day and part of dinner! They also separated all the components for me so that everything could be reheated separately.

For $20, you get a gorgeous hand car wash here  They do a good job and really pay attention to the details.  Beyond that, they actually check your claim ticket to make sure you only pick up your car.  Attention to detail and low cost make this a great carwash option!

I guess I'm the only one with a positive review, but I must say, this service is amazingly easy to use.  The people always arrive right on time within the first five minutes of my selected delivery window, and they always assist with putting everything away.  They are organized, polite and efficient.  I wish the website was more intuitive and saved items I order frequently, but other than that I think it's a great service!

There is a reason I saw four dentist offices on my way to/from this place. Candy heaven!  First off, when you're looking for this place, look for the Jelly Belly or Wonka logo, since those are bigger than the word Sweeties at the front of the building.    Once you get inside, KEEP YOUR HANDS DOWN.  I mean it--it's a must to fully walk around and get a gauge for the candies they do and don't have before you start picking up things helter skelter.  Otherwise, you'll come out and post a review saying "this place is expensive! I spent $80 on candy!!!"  I browsed everything, made a plan of attack, and walked out with $3 of snacks for the week.  The first section, clockwise, is a series of your typical candy by the pound segments.  You take your own personal scoop around with you and fill bags.  Each section is candy of the same price-per-pound, so don't mix between prices!   When you're done there, the candy by the bulk section is ahead.  After that, candy is offered in individual pieces or in bags/boxes, depending on the brand.  So you can buy one PushPop, or a box of 20...good for snack urges and also long-term candy stashes.  What I liked is that the candy you can find in grocery stores is not overpriced here, so you can grab that stuff as well.    Con: Mexican and European candy is not as readily available...I definitely thought at least Mexican candy should be available here since there is a decent selection of it at the nearby mall.  If you need sugar free candy, turn right and head to the corner when you walk in--there's a pretty good selection!  If you have kids, give them a fixed amount of money--I saw a few parents trying to reign in overly excited grabbiness.  All in all, a fun stop near work.  Worth a visit!

I never thought I could have such a good tanning experience standing naked while someone attacks every crease with a spray nozzle. Platinum Spray Tan will change all that and at a remarkably reasonable price.   First--I love the communication! Staff is excellent, you can text MJ directly and she is always SUPER responsive! Incredible in this day of technology that there is a place that understands that phone calls take forever for scheduling!  Give them your # and you can get text messages about crazy deals like $5 tan specials.   The environment is really intimate and clean; the work goes quickly and the staff is ready with a full breakdown on pre and post-tan care in case you're a first timer and ready to go if you're a regular.  Fantastic customer service.  Easy appointment, great walk through of maintenance and the results really spoke for themselves. Love this place!

Oh my gosh...the crepes...THE CREPES!!!  Look for a small dilapidated shack with letters that look like broken neon, and you've found it. But for every ounce of wear and tear and hipster flair this place has, you will rack up an additional value in TASTE.  Plus, this deliciousity is available 24/7, one of the few late-night options downtown.  Grab a menu off of the door (no it's not closed; you have to put some FORCE into opening that front door--but be careful in case someone is standing on the other side) and get in line.  You can sit up at the counter or just walk right up to the counter.  Order your crepes by their numbers--if you're picky, this staff will actually create a new combo for you.  Too cool not to have the latest tech? Log into square and say "[Insert name here] is ready to pay" and they'll send you your ticket to pay, sign, and tip from the comfort of your phone.  $7 will get you a delicious brunch-sized crepe and $2-3 will get you the fanciest coffee you want with 4 varieties of super-trendy healthy sweeteners at the bar.  If you want to sit down, head to one of the cozy tables by the windows or farther back by the piano. Don't piss off a local by taking an outlet-facing table unless you have to.  The staff is really good surprisingly about remembering names/faces, so my food almost always gets to me quickly.  Not in the mood for random screenplay writing or local music?  Ask for your order to go, but remember to specify if you want a box, because the crepes are traditionally loaded in individual cups and then in a cupholder for easy portability.  Are you there on the weekend?  Then why are you complaining about waiting 15 minutes?  These are custom made crepes!  Enjoy the local art posted around the place, or sit outside in the sunshine until your order is done. You'll forgive them their slowness by the time your first bite is in your mouth.

I don't care if you're 5 or 50, this place ROCKS!  First off--easy to find--they face away from the street but their name is in giant letters on the back of the building too, so you find it easily in the strip mall.  They explain the entire process carefully and if you ask, the girl will even give you her recommendations on which flavors go well with what bases.  LISTEN TO THEM!  They know.  The process is so fun to watch that I took a video for myself.  I'm easily entertained, you could argue.  I also love ice cream.  Anything with liquid nitrogen should be given SOME cool factor.  My ice cream was AMAZING.  Smooth, creamy, with a good distribution of flavors!  Husband went with a combination she said didn't go well together and it showed.  I definitely recommend picking a heavier base, custard or something, unless you have to pick a non-dairy option.  My soy was good because I paired it with heavy flavors.  Husband tried light base with light flavors: yogurt + Pepsi and it tasted like the foam on the Pepsi when you first pour it--smells yummy but just isn't dense or as satisfying as the Pepsi itself.  The funny thing is that if you screw it up, you can only blame yourself--after all, you pick your own ingredients.  My friend who recommended this is AWESOME and I was so thrilled with the experience.  I heard if you have kids they'll do tricks with the stuff and show how it works in a more fun way.  It was awesome from my adult-ish perspective as well!   I checked in with Yelp and got $1 off! :)

Regardless of how impeccable the service, I won't eat anything but the cheesy bread here voluntarily.  ...and I have eaten here a LOT.  This place is fairly easy to find: it's in the outdoor segment of Chandler Fashion Center, and is by the parking lot.  The decor is awesome...seriously, amazing.  Every seating area is unique and has its own charm.  From a romantic date to a huge familly, there is an area of the seating chart that is meant for you.  I love it...it helps me get through dinner, honestly.  The meals all come with the bread, salad, and spumoni (italian neopolitan ice cream), so you pay for everything in the price of your entree...honestly, that's a good deal.  The wait staff is phenomenal; they're always helpful, friendly, there when you want them, yet unobtrusive and quiet.  We've stopped the manager several times to praise an employee's outstanding service, so they are making the right hiring decisions.  The first time we ate here, I had ravioli and hubs had the rich meat sauce spaghetti.  It was easily the least flavorful ravioli I have ever eaten.  The saucing was sparse and had no boldness.  I'm not a huge fan of the sourdough bread.  The spumoni was FANTASTIC, but that was after I hated all the food and hey, I already love ice cream.  On the opposite end, my husband LOVED his food.  I tried it and thought it was the most boring spaghetti I have ever eaten.  There was nothing rich or meaty about the sauce--I personally think jar spaghetti sauce tastes better.  Second time, had the spaghetti squash; this was better, but just was interesting texturally more than taste wise. This time we had the cheesy garlic bread.  THIS is their best item.  It's melty, cheesy, garlicy wonderful on a still crisp perfect loaf.  I ate this happily and finally had a good mood after coming here.  Third time I tried the spaghetti with the light sauce, also same thing: it's so BLAND!  Seriously, I would guess that only those recovering or on plain diets would like this food...I can't fathom why my husband likes it (he keeps picking it when it's his turn, which is why I keep giving other menu items a chance...I have no choice except not to eat!).  I LOVED OSF in Houston, Texas, so I don't know what is up with this location, but it is just such bland food!  I don't like the lasagna, spaghetti, ravioli...so what exactly is the point of eating here???  I love my husband, that's basically it.  I've started getting takeout here so he can eat his boring spaghetti and I can pick up authentic Italian from elsewhere.  I feel badly because this place has such a good atmosphere and great staff, but I just don't care for the food.  I've had spaghetti, ravioli, and lasagna in Italy repeatedly, so maybe I just prefer the fresh flavorful experience and can't resign myself to this place's humdrum attitude toward food.  I still say save your $40 and go to Vincitorio's!!!

From the moment you walk in to the moment you finish your last delicious bite, Federal Pizza is a fun and awesome place to be.  The introductions are hilarious, the waitstaff balances courteous service with hilarious interjections, and the food is delicious.  I like the variety of pizzas, and the environment is friendly and clean.  Really under-emphasized when reading lists of places to eat on Central. Take some friends and check it out!  If you park in the back, you'll be next to the bakery and can get a cookie on your way out.

In the building with all the rest of the Phoenix natural medicine spots, corner to Lola/Pita Jungle.   Was greeted by super friendly people and encouraged to discuss what I like and dislike in juice so they could help me pick one. While I was waiting one of the other business owners popped in and was very friendly & encouraged me to take a tour of the other business.    They open much later now, around 9a, so I won't be able to come here often, but I think it's a great local business with good fresh juice!

Don't bother.  Dropped food. Dropped money. Forgetting menu items. Serving one person their ENTIRE meal before anyone else even gets a napkin.   I have a lot to say so I'll have to edit this later to capture the sad decline in service over the past few months that culminated in today's giant fail of a dinner attempt.

Amazing ice cream hidden in a simple office complex.  I'll have to try all of the flavors to give you more info, but I'm on the case!  So far I'll say I definitely recommend these: - Chocolate Gelato - Strawberry Jamaica & Lavender - Chai Tea
