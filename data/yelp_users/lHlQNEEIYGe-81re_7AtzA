Horrible seafood. Horrible martinis. They have a Martini slushi machine. Returned half or food because it smelled so bad. This place is a running joke for us now.

Its good sushi, the waitress is funny because she speaks Happy-Fast-Engligh-As-A-Second-Language. We go there about once every week or two

Great place to eat some oysters and make fun of all the guys in skinny jeans and man buns.

They are sooooooooooo slow here.  Do not come here if you are in a rush or have anything to do for the rest of the night. There were 3 other people in the whole place and it took our food 30 minutes to come out. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers, 30 minutes for 2 cheeseburgers at a place called Cheeseburgers. Had to ask multiple times for the check.

My new favorite sushi place. From the pics it looks like you get only a few pieces for each roll, but in reality you get about 8 pieces per roll. This is the most per roll anywhere. The sushi chef is funny also.

Saw the prices for a paddle boat, $15 on a regular day. Rented one for 4th of July, $75 and $100 for every 15 minutes past 10pm. Absolute rip off. No wonder there was only 5 other boats on the lake. Would NOT rent from them any day simply because of this price hike.

Garbage. Hair in the food. Always getting the wrong order. Food is slopped together. I drive 10 minutes outta my way to go to the other Taco Bell. Stay away.
