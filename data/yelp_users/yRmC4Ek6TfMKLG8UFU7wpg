She is seriously the BEST! Don't forget she doesn't accept cards, us regulars know that but for some reason whenever I go some people still show up to pay with their card.  I've taken multiple dresses to her, they're always quick, and always great quality. I've had a dress with sides cut-out, I had to have it taken in and it fit perfect not only that the sides were still even and you couldn't even tell it was taken in! I needed that dress in 3 days and she had it done in 2.  She can handle any type of material, from simple to complex beading! I sent my aunt to her because she needed a beaded dress taken in and the place she was going to was trying to charge her over $80! Joanna only charged her $35, seriously there is no point in going to anyone else if you want great prices and quality work!

Great gyro for a great price! I got the original gyro and chose the Greek salad instead of fries. The salad is decently sized and the Gyro is definitely worth the size. I paid a little under $7.00 for my meal with no drink. It was pretty busy at the time I went, it was about 12:15pm I only waited about 10 minutes for my food to go. I would probably recommend calling in your order if you're in a rush! The cashier was friendly and helpful, definitely will be returning!

Absolutely amazing! I had checked her website for scheduling and it said she was all booked until June and this was on 05/26. I was in an eyebrow cleanup crisis since I was leaving for Vegas in 2 days. I took a chance, called Laura and left her a message. I told her that I lived in old town less than 5 minutes away if she had any cancellations or no-shows I'd be more than happy to take their place! That call was at 1:57pm, at 2:11pm she texted me and said she had availability at 2:45pm. I showed up 5 minutes early and she was there waiting for me. I explained to her my previous issues with my eyebrow aestheticians, she completely understood I'm trying to grow out my brows. They are shaped perfectly, she worked with my natural brow shape and didn't try to make them something they're not! Not only is she great at what she does but she's so friendly and funny, we laughed a lot and joked about my trip to Vegas. I definitely will be returning and even though I don't want her to be booked all the time I really recommend you check her out!

I should have trusted the bad reviews! Although the nail tech was lovely my gel nails lifted after only 3 days, it was really unfortunate because I loved the color and the atmosphere of the nail bar. It may be due to the fact that I didn't get a manicure just gel polish, but I maintain my nails and I've had many gel polish changes before that haven't lifted. My spa pedicure was decent, however the lady kept making this face that seemed like disgust but later on I realized she may just have RBF or it may even be just her look of concentration. I may give them another shot but for $60 I expected much higher quality.
