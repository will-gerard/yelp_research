WOW. What a nice hotel for the price.  The breakfast area was great with oatmeal, eggs, fruit, yogurt.  You can even make your own waffle.  Rooms are VERY nice with great beds and furniture.  They even have sacks you can grab if in a rush with bananas and a breafast bar.  TV in the mirror. TV in the mirror. TV in the mirror. TV in the mirror.  Really cool.

There aren't a ton of restaurants and are ABSOLUTELY PHENOMINAL.  This is one and, dare I say, is the best mexican food in AZ.  I've written a fair amount of reviews and this one is likely to sound gushy enough to make my wife jealous.  Their chips are made fresh.  Not made fresh that day.  MADE FRESH FOR YOU, right when you order them.  They charge $1 for a very large basket.  Salsa is free.  The only thing I am not a fan of there is their red salsa, but thier green is so damn good and so damn hot.  I pay, but its worth it.  Ok, now the beans. Oh my God!  They are so creamy and perfect.  I highly suggest you order a side to go along with your chips.  I live a solid 30 miles from this place and will drive here JUST for the beans.  My wife loves beans so much.  Its almost unnatural.  She could seriously sit down with a plate of beans, thats it, and be happy.  She get absoluely giddy when she knows we are gonig here.  Rellenos.  Oh my God AGAIN.  I can't even describe how wonderful they are.  They really are unlike any other restaurant's I've ever had.  First off, they are huge. Secondly they use a batter that fries up so light and puffy.  So you have this slightly crisy, kinda fluffy exterior surrounding strips of relleno pepper with the most luscious, ooey gooey cheese in the center.  I dump a ton of their green salsa on top and just go to town.  All you'll here from me are moans and sighs or delight once it is put in front of me until I'm done.  They actually continue a god 30 minutes after I leave as I replay the feast in my mind.  WOW  The chicken enchiladas are perfection, the machaca is oh so good, tacos are cripsy goodness.  Here's my order...  Chips with green salsa and a side of beans while I wait for my a la cart cheese relleno and either a chicken enchilada with green sauce (not salsa) or a machaca taco.  Depends on what mood I'm in.  If I eat the whole thing for lunch.  I don't eat dinner.  There are only a couple places that really deliver every time like Rosita's does.  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM  DAMN I LOVE THIS PLACE!!

Weird place. Definitely a dive bar. Certainly dive bar customers and decor. The place is tiny with about 50% of the real estate taken over by a pool table.   Why is it so bright!? If you are gonna be a dive bar turn them things down!  With the Swizzle Inn (one of the best dive bars ever) across the street I won't be back.

Holy crap.  I can't believe I'm saying this but their Italian Beef is better than the Chicago Hamburger Company, and if you are a west sider, then I'll tell you it is better than Fuzzy's of Chicago also.    That is a seriously strong statement and I am shaking my head in disbelief while writing it, just like I was shaking my head in disbelief while eating it.  Did I say holy crap!?  HOLY CRAP its good.  The beef is wonderfully tender and juicy.  So juicy in fact they don't even serve it with au jus, but they do have it on hand if requested.  I recommend you ask for a side.  Save some for me though!  My only very minor statement is that I like the hot pepper mix at my other two spots better, but the beef...  OH the BEEF makes up for this tiny shortcoming.  I can't wait to go back.... and back... and back.

I never knew this place existed until today when a client asked to be taken here for lunch. He was an older guy, but I figured it would be good because I suggested Chelsea's Kitchen and he stayed on track wanting to go to this place.  Shortly after my whining tantrum caused purely by jealousy after driving through the Biltmore Estates we arrived at the restaurant. It is connected to the Golf Course but certainly isn't a "Biltmore" experience.  Obviously inexperienced wait staff (who did just fine, but a little awkward) and very limited menu. Just one side of one page with very normal stuff like burgers and turkey sandwiches.  I got a grilled chicken sandwich, by other two coworkers got sammies also. One a BBQ chicken and the other a burger. Our client got a turkey sandwich. ho hum..  Nothing to rave about. Several other older folks at tables. I'd say it was just fine for the price point but certainly not a place to go to unless you are hungry before or after a round and want a bite to eat. Considering the options in the area, I won't be back.

YES!  The company I work for just moved into a new building a few days ago and I was so pleased to see that there is a little sandwich shop taking up residence in the building also.  My co-workers got sandwiches the first day and all claimed they were great.  Just standard fare but a decent amount of meat with fresh bread and fixin's.  $5 with tax included is great considering the proximity and that it is not a chain by any stretch.  This morning I got a breakfast bagel sandwich.  PERFECT.  They have a large assortment of fresh bagels (I chose sesame) and the sammy have a good amount of nice fluffy scrabled eggs, with ham, bacon and cheese.  MAN was it good.  You couldn't put those ingredients together any better.  It was a whopping $3.25  They also havebreakfast burros, salads, the regular speard of cold sammies and a few hot sandwiches too.

I guess its about time I reviewed Baby Kay's. Long overdue really.  I come here quite often since I work across the street (so close we walk most of the time) and am lucky enough to be treated to lunch as a nice perk to my job.  I've never had even a mediocre meal here. Its excellent every time, and spot on with the proper Cajun flavors.  Dirty rice - excellent Jambalaya - excellent Gumbo - excellent Crawfish etouffee - OUTSTANDING  My typical meal here is to get the Cajun Combo, which has a healthy "cup" of the bottom three on my list above.   Even the potato salad and cole slaw are truly friggin fantastic.  If you like Cajun food you must go here. If you haven't had it, get your butt to Baby Kay's and give it a try!  Oh! and they have this hot sauce called "Louisiana Gold". Really great and goes awesome with their dishes. I put it (a lot!) on everything but the Divine etouffee.

UPDATE!! - Baby Kays is closing at their current location effective 8/31/13. Their A-HOLE landlord of 20 years did not even give them a chance to renew their lease. Instead the landlord just signed with a different restaurant and gave my beloved 60 days notice to vacate!  Anyway, the new location will open at the old Richardson's location on 16th Street and Bethany sometime in November. You can follow their facebook page for updates or stop in and they will take down your email address and email you updates.  Enjoy. You betta go get some etouffee while you can!!!  Had it yet again today. As good as ever. YUM.

Excellent , very upscale jewelry boutique.  They will custom make anything and did a wonderful job on my wedding ring.  They were very patient through the process and I was impressed.    They are only open 9-5 M-F so you really have to live a life of leisure or something to shop here.  They just happen to be across the street from my office so I could go at lunch.  Just as a hint of the customer base, Muhammad Ali is a regular and I saw him once while getting sizing done.

I'm definitely a fan.  Fast, well made sandwiches at a darn good price.  They have a wide assortment of sammies already on the menu, OR you can just make your own.  The first time I went I had the special of the day.  It was a crazy assortment of grilled chicken, grilled artichoke hearts, spinach, pesto and cheese (havarti, I think) on grilled tomato basil bread.  Don't get me wrong, it was very good, just not my style.  I went back the next week so I could place a custom order in an attempt to mimic the end-all-be-all of sammies from my old (now closed) sandwich haunt that they called the Entrepreneur.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!  And only $5.18.  So good in fact that I didn't eat the cookie because I didn't want to spoil the taste in my mouth.  Here's how it goes: Grilled turkey, grilled ham, and bacon on grilled sourdough with lettuce, tomato and mayo.    There is something special about this combination of flavors.  Get one.  I dare ya.

I've been here dozens and DOZENS of times over the last 25 years.  5 stars without a doubt.  Standouts are the Italian beef with "lots o hot".  Their cheese fries are absolute perfection...  here's why.  Put fries in a basket, smother them with cheese sauce, put another hand full of fries in basket, SMOTHER AGAIN WITH CHEESE SAUCE.  When you are done with these cheese fries you are looking for more fries for the cheese, not more cheese for the fries.  Then, when you walk out, school girls and boys break into song and birds start chirping.  Oh, I have to mention the cheese steak.  I don't like the standard way they do it (beef, onions, cheese) BUT if you ask for it "Philly Style" they do it with their cheese sauce that they add extra cheddar cheese to.  Yum yum yum.

Get your old watches out of your drawer! This place is just perfect. I've had 4 watch batteries replaced and one watch polished.    You walk in. The owner asks you what you need. You say watch battery. He says OK. Five minutes and $5 later he hands you your working watch. $5 is also the charge to get all those scratchs off of the face of your watch.  Bring cash. No cards accepted.   Do not pay attention to the first reviewer. Same name then but different owner.

A great unpretentious but very nice salon with good people who care about what they do.  It shows.  I go to Todd Miller.  He is a great guy and a better stylist.  SO silly that the owners picture is the photo for this place.  Sends a bad vibe that this place does NOT have.  I've been going here for years and have never met her.  Most stylists are busy/booked, but they do accept walk-ins most of the time.  Might want to call ahead though.    Ann Gentle and Heidi H. are also great.

Sit-Well has me sitting well now!   I had bought a large couch and love seat from Ashley furniture about 3 years ago. The fabric was still in great shape but the cushions were totally shot and the couch felt like it was about 100 years old. I was sitting on the springs and embarrassed as heck when we had friends over.  No wanting to spend another $2k on a new couch and love seat, I jumped on YELP (of course) to see if I could find a good company to replace the cushions. I called several and Sit-Well not only seemed the most professional, but had great pricing, so I decided to go with them.  Not wanting to spend a week without my couch cushions the owner agreed that I could take them down there one weekend to get measured and then bring them back the next once he ordered the foam and wait while they did the final cutting and stuffing. The owner was very nice to work with. His dad was even in the shop helping out when I got the original measurements taken (a quirky pair, him and his dad). Turns out the cushions were much larger than he anticipated when quoting me a price but he still honored the quote and provide his best high density foam as discussed. Good business!  After the cushions were "stuffed" (it took about 90 minutes) I hauled them back to the house. I have to admit that they were very firm, but only for the first week or so and now they have broken in nicely. One great thing about this company is that they have been in the business for ever and even offer a 15 year warranty at no additional costs. Well done Sit-Well!  Luckily I live pretty far away from this place... huh? Yep. Here's probably the best tip of my review... because I live so far I decided rather than waiting in his shop for them to stuff the cushions I asked the owner (Rick) if he knew of any good breakfast spots... and boy did he point me in the right direction. A new spot had opened up down the street called Original Breakfast House (OBH). OMG was OBH the B. O. M. B.  I'm gonna buy an old crappy couch just so I can enjoy Rick's good service and have an excuse to be in the area again for breakfast.

Yep, a doctors office that gets four stars.  I go to Doctor Underhill.  What great "bedside manner".  He was able to VERY tactfully tell me that I'm fat and drink and eat to much.  I think there will be more salad reviews in my future.  Seriously though, all the new patient forms are available on line so you can fill them out before you go.  They are on time and even open for walk-ins on the weekend and you don't have to go off site to have your blood drawn.  Good folks.

I have to admit that I am a Stein Mart lover. Moreover I'm a bargain shopping fiend.  For what it is, this place is great. Kind of like a mix (in quality and selection) between Nordstrom's Rack and TJ Maxx. You can really find some great deals here.  I'd say that the target shopper here is between 40 and 60+. I'm not in that demographic YET but if you are in the market for some great golf/business casual apparel then this is your spot. I'm a big fan of the Ben Hogan shirts. Great quality and here you can get a $100 shirt for $30 or $40 bucks.  Last visit was a great one. My wife found a REALLY awesome pea-coat for herself. $250 bucks marked down to $60, then she used a 20% off coupon she found on the net. Can you say SCORE!?... Well I can.  Check it out. You may find something you like.

This location has been on the west side forever.  They are open late in summers which is very nice because I can stop in on my way home from work.  Its a small place and won't have as many "trinkets" like inflatable alligators and stuff but if your pool needs help, they are happy to do so.  They test water for free and take pride in selling high quality items for a reasonable price.  They guys are very patient and helped me through a pool disaster last year when buying a home where the pool was so bad that I couldn't see the top step.  Now its beautiful and they help me keep it that way.  One of the guys even gave me his cell phone number so when I got home I could send him pics of my pump.  Can't ask for more than that.  Oh, they also will refill/exchange your liquid chlorine saving you a couple bucks.  FYI - the location on happy valley doens't have the permit for it.

Oh AJ's...  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways (BEERS)... 1...2...3...200!  They have so many different beers to choose from here.  If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it.  If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe, this is the place.  From 10 differnt types of flower, 15 different brands of pasta, to 20 different types of EVOO, if you're making a really great dinner, spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here.  One day I'll be able to afford the prime steaks.

Best Sushi on the west side.  Portions are great.  If you haven't been here before I'd recommend ordering much less than your typical order at other spots.  Really good bang for your buck here.  I always leave full and drunk and drop $60 MAX with tip.  That's saying something.  I've never had a "fishy" fish and I've been here dozens of times.  I hear the lunch specials are great but I'm never in the area on weekdays during that time.  The waitresses are always so bubbly and happy.  If you order a large Kirin you get a bottle of sake for a buck, PLUS you can pick from a few of their appetizers for only 50 cents.  Seriously?  Yes, seriously.  Bring your girl, and your appetite.

Goddam I love this place. I came for a special night with my special lady (Wifey) and had my best experience yet. I usually sit in the restaurant but NO MORE. Its teh sushi bar for me. It was, hands down, the best sushi experience of my life.  So fresh. Such great recommends from the Oscar, the head sushi master.  Tips from Oscar - 1. If you order your sushi of sashimi "toro" they don't charge extra but it is extra good. It is the fatty belly of the fish instead of teh "sides". Fish fat is supposed to be good for you so eat up.  2. Order a Kirin and get an saki for a buck  3. Order a Kirin and get an appetizer for a buck  4. And this is why I usually don't sit at the sushi bar... I like to tip well but always feel that when I'm at the "bar" that the sushi guy deserves the bult of the tip but I still don't want to short the waitress. I gave the waitress $15 because my check came to $75 (we ate a drank a LOT) and I also gave Oscar $5, but really the situation should be reversed since Oscar took my order and did everything but bring the drinks. He thanked me for asking and advised that they SHARE the tips. PHEW! I feel so much better!  I'll be back asap.

It is very tough to find a course on the west side of the Valley that is not surrounded  by houses.  I can't even think of one in fact.  This is a nice desert course and the is not a single hole were you have to worry about hitting someones home.  This is NOT to say that the course is easy, but it is always well cared for and one less thing to worry about while on the tee-box is a good thing for me.

I had a great experience here.  The prices and product were excellent.  Heads up that they don't take AMEX and they also don't have a computer system.  They rely on the tickets to keep track of your stuff, SO don't loose your claim ticket.

The people at this Alberson's are SO helpful and there is never a line.  Both things that are quite a change from the Fry's across the street which is always packed to the gills with customers less than chipper employees.  It seems like there is always someone there and ready to help when you need it.  My ONLY complaint is that they do not stock shallots all the time and some other obscure ingredients can't be found there.  Check it out instead of Fry's once.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.

It is tough to find a restaurant with a 20 page menu.  Even tougher to find one that does it ALL exceptionally well.    I've been here dozens of times and never, EVER, had a meal that wasn't great.  I haven't been much in the last few years because I really try to stay away from chains but went back again for the first time in at least two years last week.  Friggin awesome as usual.  In the past, the only part of their food that I wasn't in love with was their shoestring fries, and they no no longer offer them.  YES!  My meal came with normal perfectly cooked and seasoned fries.  The Navajo chicken sandwich is SO GOOD.  Pastas - SO GOOD.  Also, this might sound lame, but their chicken fingers are outstanding.  If you or your date are ever not sure what type of food you want, go here.  The selection and quality are unbelievable.  So is the service.  5 stars all the way around.

This Ray's is as good as they get.  I've been to several over the years, but who hasn't?  I had never been to this one until I moved a few months back to the area.  I must say that I have never experienced poor customer service at a Ray's, but the customer service at this particular location is out of this world GREAT.  The employees smile so big it looks like it hurts and bend over backward to make you feel welcome and that your business is GREATLY apprecaited.  You ask for a ranch, they come back with three.  You ask for ONE extra wing sauce, they beg you to take two, and they don't even mention that there are already extras in the bag.  SO REFRESHING.  Oh geez, I got so caught up in the service that I neglected to mention that their pies are friggin perfect.  For New York style pie my wife and I like it a little crispy on the bottom with plenty of sauce and chees on top.  For a Ray's, this place does it perfect, every time.  Thanks guys.

NOW THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKIN 'BOUT. The perfect dive bar. Dark. Pool tables. Pin ball machines.   If you own a dive bar, and are proud of it, get your ass to The Recovery Room and do what they do.   When I win the lotto I'm buying this place and putting it within crawling distance from my house.

Mi Comida is EXCELLENT.  I've been a dozen times or so (used to be called Mi Cocina Mi Pais, which means my kitchen my country).  The food is 5 stars but be ready to explore when you get there.  Not much is typical about the menu.  Even the beers are not what you normally see.    There are 3 different types of ceviche.  The one with white fish is the star bur all are great.  You must, MUST, get the Ecuadorian tamale.  It is wrapped in a banana leaf and just to die for.  They are darn big and run about $2.50.  My wife almost always gets the chicken stew.  So simple and so yummy.  I have a hard time staying away from the Bandera.  It is a Colombian collection of rice, sausage, fried egg, plantains, beef and an arapa (a little cake of masa).  Yikes is it good.  The fish wrapped in a banana leaf is also wonderful.    Every dish on the menu is a star.  I'd recommend you stay away from the empanadas and traditional Mexican style tamales.  Not because they are bad, but only because there are other much more defined stand outs on the menu.  There are only 5 tables inside and it is located in a strip mall behind a Taco Bell.  Don't be fooled by the location.    Don't go here if you are in a hurry.  You must relax and enjoy.  Only one person cooks and only one person serves.  The Chef/Cook/Owners husband or son will be your waiter.  The husband is hard to understand but it just adds to the charm.  The son is soft spoken and great.    The chef is classically trained and worked at the Four Seasons for many years before she started this restaurant making the food she loves and grew up with.   Mi Comida is a special place.

I found this WONDERFUL little ma and pop sandwich shop several years ago when my end-all be-all closed.    PLEASE go here and support this gem.  They bake their own bread daily and take pride in what they serve.  Sandwiches are standard deli classics done well.  I get a hot pastrami with provalone, lettuce, tomato, onion, bug juice and mayo.  YES!  My wife gets a hot Italian with the same toppings as above.  The "bug juice" is a creamy italian dressing.  I would go here more, but (unfortuantely) like ALL good sandwich shops, they are not open for dinner, or on Sundays.  They DO have what is called a "pizza kit", which is pretty cool and makes for a fun night.  What it is a a premade and cured dough ball, pizza sauce, cheese, pepperoni, and some instructions.  It is your job to stretch the dough, put on the toppings, and bake the pizza at home.  Nothing gourmet, but definitely fun and worth the wopping $6.50 they charge for it.  I have NEVER left this place unhappy.  EVER.  I've been at least 50 times.  It is one of those places you look forward to going to and when you leave you are wondering why the heck you don't go more.  If you are on the east side, I also recommend Guido's as a solid sandwich shop.  R.I.P. Prickley Pear.  Gone but never forgotten.

The Christmas lights are quite a sight in this small bar.  The prices are good.  I went on a Sunday during football so there was a bit of a crowd but still enough room in this tiny bar because of the patio.  I'll be back when in the area for a quick cocktail or two.  I love dive bars.    There are some "true" bikers there, but the majority are rich guys pretending to be bikers.  It is HILARIOUS.  Worth a stop just for that.

What a place!  What a view!  WHAT THE HECK?  I came here with my wife the Sunday before Valentine's.  It was my first time there and boy is it beautiful.    We pulled up in awe and had the valet take the car.  Hostes was nice and said we could sit in the bar or patio (both have great views).    After walking around and weighing our options we chose the bar with a seat by the window.  It was very dead as they were transitioning from brunch to dinner (it was around 2 or 3).  So, we sat down at the bar and waited...  and waited... and waiters and bartenders were walking by and cleaning...  and we kept waiting trying to get someones attention.  We waited some more...  WE LEFT.  Are you kidding me?!  My wife is georgous and we were both dressed to the 9's.  How does waiter after waiter ignor us?  There were only 2 other people in the bar/loung area.  We tipped the valet (he didn't do anything wrong) and he asked us why were were leaving so quickly.  We told him and to his credit he wanted to go get a manager but the "romance" was gone so we headed down the road to Olive and Ivy to relax on their patio.  Hope your experiance is better than ours.

Sorry for my lateness but I wanted to update everyone that after my review I was contacted by management, apologized to, and asked back for another chance. I WILL be back just as soon as it cools down and update my review then.  Everyone deserves a second chance to make things right.  I appreciate the professionalism and attention to customer service. I'm looking forward to it.

I don't like Top Shelf...  I don't like Top Shelf...  This is what I tell myself everything while shaking my head and pulling into the parking lot.  A short story about the sad state of affairs on the west side...  It is pretty interesting when you can be AT a restaurant, and talking to a packed bar full of people IN the restaurant, about how much the restaurant sucks.  This was my experience the last time I was there.  Then why are we all sitting here!!??  That concludes my short story about the sad state of restaurant (especially Mexican) affairs on the West Side.  Their tortillas are just horrible.  Thick like door mats.  Tacos, OK.  The fajita quesadilla is supposed to be top notch, but at $15 bucks, I haven't tried it.  Go across the street to the Caminero if you want some darn good Mexican.  No booze there though, just solid Mex.

Our staduim is great! I've sat in $200 seats and in $10 seats, and both in the last month. No matter where you are the view is great. The fans are great too.   Go D-BACKS!  BOO MATT WILLIAMS... BOOOOOO!!!!!!  The a-hole wouldn't sign my baseball card when I was a little kid and shrugged my off like the a-hole he is. F-ing jerk. I'll never forgive you!  Gotta love watching a game in the ac, rooting for the d-backs (and booing Matt Williams).

I got to the airport nice and early the other day and was delighted to see that delux was serving breakfast. It sounded delicious... the perfect sandwich. One of their yummy buns with two eggs, bacon and sausage. Heck yeah.  Unfortunatly it wasn't near as good as it looked and sounded. Eggs had been cooked a while ago and were a bit dry and the bun wasn't the yummy soft, fresh bun it should have been.  Fries were great. Maybe the burgers are better.

This place is damn good. They used to have a pastrami sandwich that was to die for, but it is no longer available. Saddened I got a cheesesteak that was one of the best in memory. SOLID.  I've never had the pizza so can't speak to that, but the sandwiches are proper.  Note that there are very few places to sit. You order at the counter. No table service or anything.  Enjoy.

Best patio in town.  Order the sangria pitcher and take a load off.  I won't bore you with a long review other than recommending those two items.    Recap...  Step one, get a table on the patio. Step two, order the sangria pitcher (by the glass is a rip) Step three, "take a load off".  YES that's a step!  OK fine...  One more thing if you insist.  Order something to nibble on also.  Their food is wonderful.

One of the best patios in Scottsdale.  Great stop on an afternoon of day drinking.   Recommend the side where you seat yourself.  One thing that gets me is that they change their menu every few hours.  It goes from brunch to some sort of mid-afternoon selection then to the whole dinner menu.  I find it annoying but the great service and relaxed vibe keeps me coming back.  Luckily I rarely order food.  When I do, the bruscetta trio is stellar.

Luna itself great.  Especially for a chain.  I think I have 16 or so check-ins here.  Food is four stars but the service there is always great (I sit in the bar), which adds the extra star.  Their Mexican Pizza is REALLY good... really good.  Chips are always light and cripsy.  Their happy hour is top notch too.  Their house margarita has a punch, and I'm a big guy.  HH is 3-7 M-F and on Sat and Sun (I think from noon-6) also.  I'm a pretty big snobe when it come to mexican food.  Much of the menu is prettty standard with some stars mixed in.  Fundito is solid.  Green chili is a good one too.  I wish they would bring back the chopped tuna tacos.  They also have a special for check-in on Yelp.    Special note to management (who is great) too.  Please put a rail for our feet on the back side of the bar  :)

CARLOS O'BRIENS IS MEXICAN FOOD!  Sorry for yelling but I nearly dropped my phone when I started reading reviews from people expecting Irish fare.  I've been eating at Carlos for 22 years or so.  I remember being quite young going to the 12th Street and Northern Location.  They have, hands-down, the best Pollo Fundito Chimi I have ever eaten, and boy have I eaten my fair share.  5 stars  Their chips and salsa are also always fresh.  The chips get also 5 stars.  Always fresh and hot.    Their mild salsa is very mild and watery.  Not my style but it fresh.  I mix the hot in with the mild which works form me.  Shredded beef tacos are also 5 stars.  Love 'em.  Fried ice cream is also yummy.  I'm not a desert guy so I won't attach stars to them but yum yum.  Other tips are to come at happy hour.  Good deals.  Lunch specials and portions are just right also.  Carlos O'Brien's is a great place that just gives me comfort knowing that it is there when I need it.  I spend so much time trying new places, especially mexican, that this old favorite tends to get skipped because the closest one is 15 miles from the house.  Why only 4 stars?  Only because there are more authentic places like Los Dos and Rosita's Place that get 5.  I'll be back.  I always will.  Next time sooner than later.  That darn Fundito calls my name.

Love the vig, I just wish a few less people did too!  It can be tough to get a seat after work but it always seems to work out.    Parking is a pain.  You can either go to the free valet (just tip them when you leave) or park across the street.  If you have an extra couple buck I'd suggest the valet.  Quick, easy and frankly it makes me feel "special".  Happy hour is stellar and everything I've had there is great.  Burgers, wings, salmon.  Great beer selection and even better patio.  If you read my reviews you will quickly notice a theme of 4 things...  1. Love bars 2. Love patios 3. Love food 4. Love my wife  This place satisfies all.  They have bocci ball to boot.  Grab a cocktail, put on some shades and loung in one of their comfy chairs.  Oh - staff is always on point from the bartenders to the bus boys.  Oh - (another one, sorry) I heard the owner opend a bar called Little Woodys down the street.  Haven't been but if its the same guy I'm sure its a nice spot.

I don't drink coffee but if you like tea then you should really be going here at the least.  They have whole leaf tea that is freshly and perfectly brewed.  Good selection too.  None of those darn packets!  Booo Starbucks.  BOOOO!  The staff is very helpful and patient.

I love this place, especially October through April.  Wonderful, upscale, outdoor shopping center with excellent shops and restaurants.  Also love that you can now easily hop across the street to Scottsdale Quarter for even more of the same goodness.

Seems to be a dying breed. The store next to my house closed so this is "my" new Blockbuster. AT LEAST IT IS STILL OPEN.  I hate going to red box and don't have the energy to figure out how to use my PS3 to stream movies.  Service is always good and folks are nice. Not much more to say than that.

Sorry, but don't go here. Stop at a Wendy's (you will see mainly the same customers, and get much better food) and get tickets to a real play.  Seriously a truck stop atmosphere, with truck stop humor. The actors were pretty cool and very nice, but the whole experience was very disappointing.  This is a makeshift stage in a shut down half of a Cocos restaurant. Food is from Cocos also.  Also, be prepared to be a little uncomfortable, and if they "pick" you to be a part of the show, be prepared to be embarrassed.

This place is solid in every way.  Great local brewed beer.  The food is surpisingly good every time.  The menu is huge and they really do everything well from pastas and pizzas which are excellent to their Philly, which is equally great (they put a little gravy on it, mmm), and wraps.  Fries are darn good.  Servers are all nice and like working there. It shows.  Good lunch specials.  Good happy hour too with half priced appetizers.  I really recommend this place.  Solid and semi-local.  Can get busy but I always sit at the bar.  PS.  Believe it or not I met my wife there a few years ago!  Thats why it gets the 5th star.  :)

Furniture and kitchen gadgets that will make your friends jealous.  If you are getting married and don't register here, SHAME ON YOU!  Some things can get pricey but the quality is always there at this store.  With kitchen stuff, just like furniture, you get what you pay for.  This holds true here.

I don't like this store.  The manager was condisending to me once because I brought a propane container into the store to be filled.  I'm 32, not a 6 year old kindergardener.  There produces IS good and there is a good selection.  Decent prices on booze too.  Their meats are poor at best.  I only come here when Albertson's, across the street, is out of something.

Although folks that have been coming here since there was only the one on 32nd and Shea say it has gone downhill, I still really like Uncle Sam's.  Indeed it has but we are talking from "outstanding" to still "really darn good".  If you want the old Uncle Sam's order your cheese steak with extra meat and cheese.  It costs a few bucks extra but the value is still there.    Their dollar drafts at happy hour and "bail out" plan are some of the greatest values around.  They still have the best cheese steak in town when ordered as described above.  Service is always great along with the wings.  Can't speak on anything else because that is about all I've ever ordered for the last 25 years of patronage.

Hate the prices and the line.  Love the cupcakes and the look on my Wife's face when she is eating one.    Take your girl if in the area.  You will get major BROWNIE points for splurging on CUPCAKES.    Highly recommend the carrot cake and chocolate with coconut.  mmmm  Enjoy!

I could rate this place 5 stars and I could rate it 2.  First, don't pay their rediculous $25 "resort fee". Tell them no and they will waive it, unless you seriously came to Vegas to work out and you feel obligated to pay (don't forget you are about to lose you a$$ at the tables.  Second, if you are the type of person who appreciates a nice, chilly, hotel room, bring it up with management. Thay have a code that will stop the goddam AC from turning off when you leave the room or FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT. They have those annoying motion sensors that only turn on the AC while you are in the room.   Third, have fun. The rooms are great and staff very accomodating.  Fourth, eat breakfast at that French restaurant to the left of the check in. The "ham and cheese" crepe is wonderful, so is everthing else.  One of the best breakfasts of my life. WOW.  Oh, and the location is great. Its really nice to have that walgreens right on the corner.

This is another of my many reviews based solely on their happy hour and sitting at the bar.  First let me say that this place is COOL. Interior decor in a blondish wood. Jaw dropping selection of Saki and a very eclectic drink menu, much of which is included in their happy hour WHICH INCLUDES WEEKENDS.  Their rolls are all amazing. Again, many included in their happy hour at deeply discounted prices.  Funny enough the thing that has my wife and I coming back again and again are these damn little burgers for two bucks each. HOLY SH*T are they good. I mean come on... how good can they be? THAT F-ING GOOD is how good. God in Heaven smiles at me when I order them. Yikes.

I go here every year with my Wife.  It makes for a beautiful night of holding hands in the crisp air while meandering down candlelit paths between the live musical performances.  I love the Native American flute/story-teller.  My wife love the "Dickens" carolers.  Get your tickets early as the popular nights (Fridays and Saturdays) sell out quickly.  I also recommend to get there early.  You'l' be surprised how quickly the night goes.  Dress warm!  It really gets us in the Christmas spirit.

Z Greek is consistently delicious.    Zervice is as good as you will ever find ordering from a counter.  Portions are huge.  They skimp on nothing.  Gyro's are just wonderful.  You can't go wrong with any menu item at Z's.

I finally had the opportunity to go here a few weeks ago and I was definitely impressed.  Its a French place for those who don't know (I didn't)  I had a warm beet soup to start that, believe it or not, was just wonderful. Velvety smooth texture... so nice. Mellow fresh beet flavor...  Main course was the lamb that was suggested by the waiter. Not much to say other than it couldn't have been prepared more perfectly. Great cut of quality meat. Outstanding job.  Service was impeccable and the ladies loved their lobster salads by the way. Yummmmy.  I'll be back again without a doubt.

This is a mainly a review of the bar.  Food secondary as I drink here much more than I eat.  First off, happy hour is good and lasts until 7.  Good for us folk on the west side who can't make it back from our jobs in the big city until 6.  Beer selection is ok.  A few of the typical on tap and always something nice on the "guest" tap.  I do have to say that the bar tenders are pretty tight on their pours of the hard stuff.   Because of this I pretty much stick to beer at Dillon's.  The bar is comfortable with a ton of TV.  Many are new, nice, flat screens.  Problem (BIG) is that they are not connected to HD.  What???    Oh how I would love to watch NFL there.  Fix the HD issue and you'll definitly have several more customers on Sundays.  The BBQ is darn good.  I do my own so am pretty picky.  This also means a very rarely order it.  They do a great chicken fried steak (and chicken).  Fries are good.  Gravy, both white and brown are good.  This location is undergoing a big changing of the guard right now with two of their long time bartenders 5 months pregnant.  The new girls definitely need some work but hopefully Carl, the very affable manager (did you try the velvet hammer yet?), will get them in line.  I'll give it some time.  The best thing that keeps me coming back are the bar specials.  They are good all the time, as long as you are in the bar.  They have a small order of onion rings for ONE DOLLAR.  The onion rings are fantastic to boot.  They also have Potato Peels for ONE DOLLAR.  This is essentially are just what they say they are, the peels of the potatoes they use for their mashed potatoes.  Most are pretty thick and they give you a great portion.  Like thick potatoe ships, kinda.

I have to review this place to give it 5 stars for just one sandwich.  For what it is (fast food) their hamburger (not all of them) is top notch.  Here's the deal.  Go in and get a 1/2 pound double with cheese.  No substitutions.  Nada.  Get some napkins too.  You'll need them.  I'm pretty snobby about burgers. Holy crap is it good. It just is. I almost hate that it is so damn good.  BUT IT IS!  Could be that I didn't spend $13 dollars on it, BUT IT IS!

Pretty cool spot.  I was in town for a business conference and they took about 25 of us here to unwind a bit.  Tons of TVs.  Not your typical "bowling alley".  Its more of a nice (very large) bar with 20 or so bowling lanes if you're so inclined.  Good beer selection.  Food was ok but they set up a buffet for us so I can't really say one way or the other as to quality.  Our services was quite good especially considering the large group.  I have a feeling (by the the large group next to us) that this is pretty normal for them.  Place is a twin of Lucky Strike back in Phoenix but not quite as nice.  Steeeeee- rike~!  Sorry, had visions of Al Bundy and his thumb warmer the whole time is was there.

I tried to use Google Translate to find out how to say "Holy crap that was expensive" in some Indian language but didn't have the option.  I came here with a client yesterday for lunch. It was my second time a Tandoori Times, although this location was a new one. Its actually kind of tough to find... tucked away in a pretty large complex of businesses and restaurants.  We sat down and were greeted by a very nice waiter. We both ordered an Indian beer and asked for suggestions. He pointed a few out and we got to ordering.  Appetizer was a Lamb Kabob (but they take out the stick before it is served). Just ground lamb with some sautéed onions and peppers. It was accompanied by a few sauces. It was ok but certainly nothing earth shattering.  Then we ordered two entrees he recommended. One was a shrimp dish with a reddish curry. The other was chicken vindaloo. Pretty much chicken with potatoes in a yellowish curry.  He also suggested we get some nan (a flat bread) and some rice, advising the dishes were family style.  Hope I don't sound to crabby, but the portions were crap. I was expecting it to be like a Chinese restaurant where you get a good portion to share. NOPE. The shrimp dish had a whopping 6 shrimp. For $14 bucks I expected much more than that, especially after teh family style/sharing comment. If I go to a Chinese place and get spicy shrimp they bring out a proper portion.   Same with the chicken. Maybe 6 or 8 chunks of chicken with a little potatoes. Same story as above. Anywhere else and I'd get a mountain of chicken. Enough to share, right?!  The little bit of lamb was $13, plus they also charged for the nan and rice. $3 bucks each. Anyway, the food was definitely good, but when accompanied by a $67 bill (plus $13 tip), this was probably the smallest $80 meal I've had. Both my client and I could have eaten much more if allowed.  So I guess to sum it up. Good food but not at its price point. Those things have to line up to get a glowing review from this Yelper.  Highly recommend it though if price isn't a big concern. Can't wait to have to explain to my boss why I'm expensing an $80 lunch for just me and one client at an Indian joint.

I figured I would write an update on this review since the waiter reached out and attempted to rebut the points in my review. Unfortunately all it did was change their review from 2 stars to one.   The waiter's comments are below.   Waiter response to my original review - - - "Hi, i waited to respond so i could look at your check for this day. First i apologize for your experience Lamb Seekh Kabob is served without skewers because they are metal ones and 5' long. We have daily lunch specials which run from $8.95 to $11.95 , its complete lunch and comes with everything. Lunch specials combo of two dishes is only $2.95 additional.  We cannot compare Indian restaurant with Chinese restaurant. Tips were voluntary. We will surely look into our prices compared to other Indian restaurants. Thanks"  My response to this is...  I followed your lead when ordering our meal from beginning to end... I trusted you... if you had options that could have SIGNIFICANTLY reduced our bill, why was there absolutely no mention of this during my 90 minute lunch?!  I originally thought the service and food was good, but meal was overpriced compared to what we received. Instead, apparently the service was not good. You seem to have let me pay $13+ for each meal plus an additional $3 for rice and $3 for nan when we could have gotten much more for a lesser price (and likely left very satisfied). We trusted you to guide us to good food, not just good food that would pad the bill at a la carte prices. In the future, you may want to guide your customers to your specials.

Postino Central is my fav location of this great restaurant. Not a whole bunch to add to the mass of reviews. gI especially love it because of the proximity to Federal, Joyride and Windsor...   Reason its so great... THEY ALL HAVE HAPPY HOUR FROM 11a to 5p EVEN ON WEEKENDS!  DRINK UP!!!

This place has really great mexican food.  Carne Asada is quite good and the three salsas you get with each order are all great.  They actually toast their burritos on all sides.  Nice touch that adds nice flavor.  I orderded a carne asada burrito and one shrimp and one fish taco.  The carne asada part was great.  Thing is they put rice and beans in the burro so I am not getting that mouth full of the wonderful beef that I would like.  It is on the menu that way so can't really complain.  The shrimp taco was good, nothing crazy but I did enjoy.  The fish taco was great!  Great sauce and perfectly cooked fish.  I'll be ordering that again for sure.  The first time I went I also got an asada burro but got a barbacoa taco also.  The barbacoa is very good also and the burro was identical to the first time, which is a good thing.  I have to say that I was a little put off by one of the owners over a Yelp coupon.  He eventually said he would accept the coupon.    Must say I'll be back though.  Prices are a little higher than the norm (so is the quality) so buy the Yelp gift cert or groupon.  Enjoy.

One star for service.  3.5 for food.  Dear Revo, When a business orders lunch to be ready at a specific time, and well in advance, MAKE THE DAMN FOOD AND MAKE IT READY WHEN YOU SAY YOU WILL.  Sorry for yelling.  Had to vent.  They have done this to me 3 times now where we order at 11 for an 11:45 pickup only to have the person picking up wait 20 minutes.  You've lost our office's lunch business.  This is a shame because the food is quite good.  Even if you eat in they are very slow though.  SO, if you have an hour or two for lunch, give it a try.  Everything I have had is good.  Solid green chili and carne asada.  Real stand out is the creamy rice that comes with the combos, YUM!

Really.  Good.  Italian.  Lasagne is absolutely fantastic.  Everything there is.  The sad part is they had, hands down, THE BESTcalamari in town.  Sooo friggin good but they changed it and now it is mediocre at best.  Strang becuase everything else is so good.  Take it for someone who has been for at least 30 meals.  Good happy hour too.   Also, be aware that unless you are going for lunch (which I recommend) you will need to valet.  Its free, except for the couple bucks in tip, and fast.  PS, don't get the burger and give it a bad rating.  If anything give yourself a single star rating for being an idiot and ordering a burger at an Italian place.  Manga!

Excellent beer selection with bartenders that seem a little "too cool for school" but service is still pretty good at the bar. Food is solid but one thing REALLY bothers me about this place...  NO FRYER, which means no fries. They take pride in this for some strange reason.  I don't always want fries, but knowing I can't have them makes me want them twice as much.

Go here.  Best Mexican for miles around.  I'm a strange breed and, as a Native, love Mexican food of all shapes and sizes.  From greasy, gut rot Bertos, to central Mexico and New Mexican authentic, to high class more fancy Mex in Scottsdale. I love all types of regional Mexican fare.  This place sits nicely in the middle of grease and Scottsdale.  No drive through but you do order from a counter.  The nice part is that if you eat in, your food comes on a actual plate and the guy behind the counter will actually bring it to you with real silverware.  Been here a few time and each time was very good, and cheap to boot.  I recommend the Caminero burro.  Solid beans and salsa too.  Just a nice little family owned spot with a menu similar to most Mexican places with the assortment of burros, enchiladas and tacos.  They just do it a little better here than most places and certainly WAY BETTER than the ripoff, joke of a Mexican restaurant across the street, Top Shelf.  Laugh as you leave and look across the street at Top Shelf.  You'll $20 richer and a good bit happier than if you went there

Caminero is like my mistress. I wake up thinking about you. You make me happy and never judge me. You don't get mad when I cheat on you and when I come back into your arms feeling guilty you give me a big hug. I can even bring my wife around you, although I here she is now making solo visits and not letting me watch.  My latest hug was the Chorizo Breakfast burrito. Its the best I've had. Perfect blend of cheese, chorizo and eggs. The hug before that was the chicken taquitos, which might I say are hand rolled and very meaty, not from a box like that ugly whore "Berto" down the street.  See you soon my love.

They took the chicken wings off of the menu but you can still get a huge portion of their delicious fried chicken for $10 with fries.  Last time I was there I had the fish and chips.  Good portion and perfectly cooked.  They also offer at least 4 AZ brewed beers on tap.  Great to see.  Support this AZ establishment.  Heads up - they often offer discounts on restaurant.com which are also good for booze.

Sorry Lafitte's.  I was pretty stoked to go here after reading some positive reviews.  I also had a "spend $35 and get $25 off" certificate from restaurant.com which made the excitement even greater.  I parked under a sign that said I better lock my car or I'm SOL.  I'm a big boy so ok, no worries.  Still optimistic.  When we walked in I felt like I was in the school cafeteria with all the lights.  Boy is it bright.  It was also dead.  A few "blue hairs" in the booths but I didn't come here to socialize.  Again, ok, still optimistic.  Waiter came quickly along with her backup with some bread.  ho hum.  Just bread with a little granulated garlic on top and packets of butter.  Ok, getting just a little worried.  There were just the two of us (my Wifey and I) and we had $35 buck to spend so we ordered up.  She got the crab cakes.  I got the prime rib.  We also got the wings and ribs combo to taste what everyone what talking about.  The crab cakes were poor and had a fishy taste.    My Prime Rib was a nice big hunk, tender, and cooked properly.  The strange part was is was covered in gravy.  Huh?  Not au jus, just thick, salty, plane, brown gravy.  I friggin LOVE gravy, but not on my prime rib please.  This was definitely gravy from a packet too.  I actually said to my wife that I didn't like the gravy.  She dropped her fork, laughed, and said that she never thought she would hear me utter those words.  I'm pretty surprised that I didn't hear about the gravy in other reviews.  It came with a salad, which was fresh, a vegetable, and a side.  I chose the mashed potatoes.  The veggies were squash.  A little undercooked and WAY under seasoned.  Potatoes were the same way.  Tasteless, even after I scraped the gravy onto them.  The final piece of the meal was the wings and ribs.  The wings were actually great.  Perfectly cooked with a nice seasoning to them.  A surprise star was the blue cheese that I asked for with the ribs.  Great blue cheese with huge pieces inside the large portion they gave.  The ribs were cooked properly but I didn't care for the aftertaste to the BBQ sauce.  All in all it was decent at best.  Again, the prime rib at $19 bucks is a steal, too bad they couldn't round out the rest of the meal.  Even with another coupon, I doubt I'll be back

I've been several more times since my first review and just had their grilled chicken wings for the first time.  At happy hour (daily until 7) they are half off so only 4 or 5 bucks for a dozen.  They were EXCELLENT.  Still stand by Sakana being by far the go-to spot on the west side for sushi.

I've been here 4 times.  They are hit and miss with great experiences I want to tell everyone about and really bad ones that I wish never happened.  The bad experiences seemed to all revolve around the hostess girls.  The last one was bad but I'll be back again because of their awesome happy hour.  I consider myself a happy hour expert and theirs is damn good with several top shelf options for bottom shelf prices.  They (are supposed to) open at 4:00pm.  The last time I went my wife and I showed up a few minutes early.  The door was locked but no biggie, they aren't open yet after-all, so we decided to chill and chat outside the door.  4 o'clock came and we tried again but still locked...  Whatever, its beautiful out and I have the best company in the world to wait with.  4:05.  Still locked.  By this time another couple had come by and left, not wanting to wait like us.  4:10...  still locked.  Seriously?  So I decided to call almost as a joke.  I did.  They picked up.  I asked what time they opened.  She girl replied happily that they opened at 4.  My next question was to ask what time it was because I was waiting outside.  I was nice about it and all.  Her reply was "ummm", then I heard her ask someone else if the time was right on the computer, then she put me on hold.  Tic toc..., a minute or two went by and by this time we were getting a little frustrated with it now being almost 4:15.  I hung up, tried the door again, still locked, so we walked away.  We got pretty far away and sat on a bench so I could consult Yelp on the next new spot and looked back to see a girl poking her head out the door.  We went back and were let in.  No "sorry about that" or anything which is about all it would have taken.  We ordered our cocktails (the C.E.O.) which is supposed to be a dirty martini with Chopin, by far my fav vodka.  Its a potato vodka unlike the Belveder (also very good but not Chopin) which he used for the martinis.  Small detail but it would have been nice if he said something instead of just using a different vodka than listed on the menu.  We ordered their steak quesadilla which was awesome as usual.    I've had dinner here also and it was expensive but very good.  Place gets nuts (pretty fun crowd) at night with live bands, cougars looking for rich guys, and poor guys pretending to be rich to land a cougar.   Post up at the bar and have fun.    So I guess "it is what it is".  I'll be back.  People watching is great.

I typically like the berto places but they certainly range from location to location.  This one is NOT a good one.  Try Filberto's a mile down the road on 30th street and Indian (newly remodeled and clean, they also give you chips while you wait) or Armando's on 36th and Thomas.  These rec's of course are limited only to Berto's type of places.  If your not in a hurry the list changes entirely.

ALERT!!! ALERT!!!  MAUI DOG IS CLOSING ON DECEMBER 29th.  I had lunch here today and the owner passed along the news.  Landlord is hiking rent and he never made a profit so can't aford to stay and is out of the cash needed to move locations.  A sad day for Phoenix.  I have to say, SHAME on myself and the rest of the Phoenix foodies and Yelpers out there.  We all love this place, so why don't we go?  I work 2 miles from here and have only been three times.  AND I LOVE IT.  I've told people to go.  THEY love it.  Alas...  Two weeks from today...  no more Maui Dog.  Thanks to the owner for his pride and guts with this delicious concept.  I hope to see you pop up again somewhere in the valley.  If you do, I vow to be more supportive.  I will definitly be back again before you close.  EVERYONE should.  You know you have it bookmarked.  Change that bookmark to a Check In YELPERS!

My wife and her family love the margaritas here, but only because they are strong.  They are but NOT cheap.  My chimi was ok.  The shrimp fajitas were also just ok.  Frozen fairly small shrimp.  The options around this area are limited.  The chimi (luch portion) 7.99, fajitas 12.99 and two margs each ran $46 bucks.  Yikes!  If you can, go somewhere else.

Been here a couple times for food.  Once for a beer.  Food is quite good (green chili) but their customer service is VERY lack luster, and I'm not picky. The people up front always smile, but it is always one of those f-u smiles.  Just a bad vibe.  They even charged for a water cup once. Not cool.

Very cool place with tons of people, bars, restaurants and options.  Adult Disneyland.  It is what it is.  People know that when they go.  For what it is, I don't see how it could get much better.

These guys came out to fix my windshield after a rock chip spread after a trip up north.  The offered a time window of 8-12 the next day which was fine.  I got a call just after 8 to say that I was the first stop and he would be there soon.  The van showed up about 8:30.  Very nice tech.  He got started but they gave him the wrong windshield so we had to wait another hour for the correct one to show.  Bummer.  Then he was using a new tool to remove the window and it fell through and cause some minor damage to the paint.  Bummer.  He was apologetic and said they would fix it but who has time to put your car in the shop!!??  Two days later (Sunday) it rained.  I pulled my car out of the garage and my windshield wipers were put on wrong and not working.    Safelite was closed of course to I had to take it to a mechanic to have them fix it.  Another few hours lost.  Pretty disappointing.

You gotta love Nordstom's Rack! Great selection of high end cloths and shoes and, usually, about half price. AND you still get to enjoy the wonderful Nordstrom's return policy so you never have to worry about returning ANYTHING for any reason.  For instance... I bought a pair of very nice Hugo Boss black loafers last week. I wore them for a full day and got a blister (I'm used to Bruno Magli or Too Boots). Remember these are leather soled and hard leather upper shoes, so when you wear them you can certainly tell.  Not a peek. Returned them with a smile. Nordies... I'm smitten.

This place is probably closed by now.  Heard it was from the rumor mill.  I hate to say it makes me happy because I really try to support local spots.  This one is so close to my house and I want it to be good so badly.  Its been through at least three different names/owners over the last couple years (Hammerheads, Portofino's Beach Bar, and Dirty Pelican).  Every one of them were horrible.  Mediocre food at best.  Decent drink prices but the ambiance is just atrocious.    Ever want to have a beer at Wal-Mart or your local aquarium store?  Me either.  This place is a cross between them.  Unappealing, uninviting, just poor all the way around.  Advice to the new owner...  Change the beach theme and lose the aquariums.  The place needs to be gutted.  Make us want to come in and when we get there give us service that makes us want to stay.  The last time I was in there we had pretty bad service from the bartender.  He didn't notice us for quite a while sitting at the bar after we arrived (it was slow).  Then it was just poor from there on.  He didn't seem to know the food specials.  My wife and I both gave each other the "wow" look.  How does the bartender not know the happy hour specials?  Turns out we get our bill and the guy (bartender) tells us he is the owner and to come back again soon.  WHAT!?  If owned a bar...

I've never had their pizza. I've never had their salads. I HAVE HAD THEIR MEATBALL SUB WHICH IS...BY FAR... THE BEST MEATBALL SUB I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OR PUTTING IN MY BIG MOUTH!!!  Holy crap... I mean... HOLY CRAP.   Sorry for yelling but I wanna shout it from the rooftops.  Have you ever eaten something so good that you were mad that you hadn't ever eaten it before? Its rare, but that is what happened to me the other day at Oregano's.  I've had hundreds of meatball subs in my 34 years on this earth. Most were decent. NONE compared to what I had the pleasure of eating the other day.   Its also huge. My wife and I shared the calamari appetizer (it was ok) and split this monster sandwich at about 1:30 and neither of us were even hungry for dinner. We added onions and peppers per the recommendation of the excellent bartender (who is truly awesome at his job... a real pleasure to watch work).  I also recommend getting a side a marinara, so you can drizzle a little on each bite. Just do it.  Next time we go we will split the "small salad", which is HUGE and this sammy. Maybe wings, which are also excellent here.  Here is my solemn oath.. I, Nick R., will never, EVER, step foot in an Oregano's again without ordering this heavenly creation, my new bestie, the meatball sub.  I'm glad the Chicago deep dish pizzas take 45 minutes to cook (heads up, you can call ahead if you want one), otherwise I would have never had the pleasure of making its acquaintance.   Thank you Oregano's... thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I've been back twice since my original review and I wanted to say that this wasn't a fluke. I've gotten (split with someone) the meatball sub each time and split a salad.  Each one is better, and seemingly bigger, than the next!  If you have dinner plans, I wouldn't eat lunch here!  Can't wait to try the pizza!

Very happy to see a small bar pop up close to the house.  It is what it is, a small bar with small bar food.  No cullinary stars in the kitchen but reports from the croud are that the food is just what you would expect and decent.  They have $2.50 coronas all the time and specials on canned beer which is great to see from a place like this.  Where they do excell is on their TV's.  They have at least a dozen BIG ones.  Full HD and they also have two projectors that broadcast onto entire walls.    This bar is very small so I'd say that they have as close to as many TV's per square foot as Santisi Bros, and with better quality.  Now that is saying something.  Support your local dive bar!!!!!

This QT, like nearly every other I've been to, is great.  Helpful staff who run two registers at once so you never get caught behind someone cashing in, then buying, a hundred scratcher tickets.  Hallelujah!!

First I have to say that I've only been once and only had appetizers (several as I was with a group on business). We had cocktails, pizzas, and several of their cheese and meat trays.  I wasn't excited to go as I used to have a North in my neighborhood in Glendale and was not impressed. I've also been to the Scottsdale location and the white leather, super modern motif doesn't really do it for me. The food was always "just ok" too, especially for the price.  Things have changed. The North in Arcadia is set up to look like a rustic Italian kitchen. I give major kudos for the pasta being freshly made by hand.  The cocktails I was having (called the Quiet Italian Gentleman) were a fantastic mix of rye, amaretto, and two other Italian liquors. Yum!  Another cool note is that they use a hand cranked deli slicer to slice their meats in order not to melt the wonderful fats in the meat. I've never seen this before and enjoyed the touch.  Pizzas were fair to good, but pizza is a tough nut to crack. I think I had every meat and cheese they offered. Every one was quite nice.  The only draw back was that it was HOT inside, which is apparently a problem as the manager came by to advise that an additional unit is being installed so this shouldn't be an issue going forward.  Our server was also excellent.  I'll be back.  PS Parking is valet only, which annoys some people. Not me since it is complementary and makes me feel special so its worth the couple buck tip.

Always good.  Always full when I leave.  Always a line too but it always goes quickly.  Great standby for when you've spent too long long on Yelp trying to decide where to go and are too hungry to think any longer.

A great thing happened when I went here...    I really wanted to like it, and I actually DID!  I loved it actually.  Seems to happen rarely lately with let downs more common than not.  Been twice now and both times was VERY happy with my meals and service.  The second time that I went was for lunch.  I got a seafood pasta with Mussels, Shrimp, white fish, and calamari.  It was $15 bucks and well worth every penny.  Great portion of each ingredient and the calamari was SO tender with a wonderfully mild flavor that I actually asked the waitress if it really was calamari.  WOW  We were a party of 4 and all of us loved our dishes and left full with no appetizers other than some bread and olive oil (which was delish, of course).    People complain about portion size and I am a BIG (usually over) eater.  I was happy.  Others complain about price.  Go to AJ's and get great pasta (not Barilla!), great San Marzan Tomatoes (not Hunts!) fresh basil and seafood so fresh its still wiggling and you'll see why you don't get a trough of pasta for $13 bucks.  Better yet, make it yourself, so you'll actually slow down and enjoy the differences of taste and texture.  Either develop your palate, or stay at Olive Garden and don't review this wonderful restaurant.  I'm an avid cook (kind Wifey would say chef, but never any formal schooling for moi) and I've really been getting into authentic, rustic, Italian cooking.  Simple, fresh, phenomenal, ingredients put together with love and care.  The menu rotates so that he can serve only the freshest ingredients.  BIANCO NAILS IT!    I need to say it again...  BIANCO NAILS IT!!!

Went for lunch again. Impressed again with the food and the place was twice as busy as I've ever seen it and it was quite loud inside, which I'm ok with. Happy to see this but the service was unfortunately poor for the first time, but I'll give them a pass, this time since I come for the food and wasn't in a hurry. Nice girl but seemed to forget we were there. I don't think they were expecting the rush. I was with 4 others.  I had the special of the day which were the gnocchi with a bolognese ragu. Melt in your mouth MMMMMMM I also got a side of meatballs. They come in 3's. Love em.  SO FULL  I'll update again on the service next time I'm back.

I hate to say it but I keep having bad experiences here. I used to love Caramba's and have been going to the Bell location since highschool. I got a "Giant Caramba" with Machaca yesterday because it was on special. My wife got a machaca burrito and added beans and guac (which is her standard, she's been gonig here off and on forever also).  My burrito was huge, covered with melty cheese and really good red sauce. Sounds good right!?  Unfortunatly, no. My huge burro was 75% tortilla with just a little bit of meat. Seriously. I actually counted 7, YES SEVEN, layers of tortilla on the bottom of my burro. I'm shaking my head in disappointment while writing this.Where's the beef?!  My wife's burro was just as dissappointing. Just a very small portion of meat. When you get a beef burrito, and add beans, they are not supposed to take away beef. It should be the same damn amount of beef with beans ADDED. Again, where's the beef!?!?  I would much rather be at Cafe Rumba on 59th and Union, or, better yet, Caminero on 83rd and Deer Valley, both of which have excellent food at the same (or better) price point.   I waited a while before deciding to leave a bad review, something I don't like doing. This was my 4th time at this "new" location, my 4th time hoping for something to change, and my 4th time dissapointed. I won't be back again.

Although I haven't officially been a paying customer yet I am STILL giving this place 5 stars.  My wife and I were walking around the Scottsdale Quarter and ran into this new establishment.  It is basically the make your own pottery place "As You Wish" pumped up on some serious steroids.  You can make your own soap, candles, birthday cakes and, of course, pottery.   They are in a wonderful space unlike the typically tight quarters of As You Wish.  The girl up front was very bubbly and helpful and promptly took us on a tour.  Here's the kicker...  They will soon be able to serve wine and beer!!!  Couldn't imagine a young kids birthday without buzzed chaperons!  Tons of neat stuff for young and old alike.  I'll be back.

I went here last week with my Wifey. I'm a nice guy and damn good hubby, but painting potter "just aint my thang". Poor girl had to beg for months for this one.  Really cool place. Not only can you paint pottery, but make soap, make candles, even decorate a dang cake. We went on a Sunday and it wasn't as busy as expected.  The staff was great. Very helpful and patient. They were even sweet enough to lie about the monstrosity of a coffee cup I painted and pass out a few compliments.  Seriously guys... take your lady here. Grin and bare the humiliation and wallow in the sheer delight that is making your wife happy.  Oh, and take lots of pictures so you can remind her what a great guy you are.  FYI - you are looking at about $10 or $15 bucks each for most of the pottery, then there is a $13 each price for using the facilities (for all the paint you waste, paint brushes, etc.). The whole thing was about $60 bucks. Kinda steep if you think of it as "just two coffee cups", but if you think of it as an experience, I was ok with it. Heads up though... they do offer tons of little things the call "POP", pretty much little decorations that cost extra. If you are letting a little kid run wild in here you may end up with a thousand dollar cake. My wife and I just painted coffee cups so what I thought I was going to pay was exactly what I paid. I like that. If you have kids, set limits... DUH.  Have fun!!!

I've gotta agree with the poor reviews.  My wife and I went on a Saturday around lunch.    Two years ago we were in Manhattan for their San Gennaro festival.  I didn't go in expecting this to compare but I was surprised at the stark contrast.  I was expensive!  Even with the coupon it was $12 to get in.  $9 for a poor sausage and pepper sandwich (we didn't finish it). $10 for two beers.  The way I look at it I paid $31 to get dusty and realize I was in the wrong place.  Shoulda spent it on boxing a trifecta!  The one diamond was the old sweet Italian man that was wandering around the food court singing.  He didn't sing to us but we chatted with him for a minute.  Boy he had the sweetest smile.  Reminded me of my Pop pop.  I'm would never go on a carnie ride, I guess I am just chicken, so I came here for the Italian experience and food.  I always feel badly for the animals too.  There is zero "Italian experience" to be had and unfortunately it looks like we just picked a bad vendor.  I saw some people carrying around some great looking food.  Then again, our sausage and peppers LOOKED great.  The singer when I was there was laughably bad.  Khaki docker pants, white sneakers, black shirt, and a voice that fit only a mother could love.  Looked like a Seinfeld outfit from the 90's.  Sounds like some other people got to enjoy some better acts.  He wasn't one of the "headliners".  A big part of the turn off was the dirt lot the event was held on.  I try to go to a lot of festivals, I really like browsing around, but this one just fell flat.  A different location might bring a tiny bit of much needed class to this event.  Good thing that Turf Paradise is a short walk away.  Had fun there!

Rating as a bar only after one trip on a Sunday morning...  My Wifey and I needed to kill some time before we painted some pottery at Make Meaning.... So... what did we do... hit the bar OF COURSE.  It is really funny walking into dive bars with my foxy wife and watching guys break their necks to get a glance. This place has OTB so hips likely got broken also by the older clientel (gambling addicts) spinning in their chairs.  Anyway, the bartender was nice. Good drink specials, and a VERY SOLID BLOODY BAR.  I mean f-ing proper. At least 10 hot sauces, 10 different seasonings, 4 or 5 types of "mix", another 8 or so toppings (pickles, a couple different types of peppers, olives, celery, etc).  Hell yeah.   I may come back if hungry and in the area considering the great reviews the food gets. What was coming out of the kitchen looked very solid.

Quite surprised there are no reviews of this Chipotle yet.  Its been open for a month or two.  My lovely Wifey and I stopped in on the way back from Cali on Monday at around 8.    It was my first time inside and I was a little surprised that it is not quite the "standard" Chipotle set up.  There is no wall dividing where the line backs up with the rest of the restaurant.  There wasn't much of a line when I was there but imagine it could get annoying if you were at one of the tables in the areas with someone literally standing right next to you while you are eating.  On top of this the tables "next to the line" are high tops, so I imagine the folks in line are that much more in your space.  When I went they were out of barbacoa so that was a bummer.  Other than that its your standard Chipotle.

This is my favorite Asian market in the Valley. Its just the right size and the empolyees are more helpful to this white boy than at other locations. I'm always looking for some crazy ingredient (lime leaf or galanga or certain noodles or plantains or whatever).  Prices are excellent for produce. You can buy limes and garlic and squash for pennies on the dollar compared to the chain stores. You can also find some off beat beers here.  It think its just the right size too and laid out well. I can get lost for hours at Lee Lee.  Yes, it does smell like every other Asian market I've ever been to. God I hate it, but for some reason I don't think I would trust the place.

Los Dos is the shiz-nittle-SNAP! Yes it is hot! DAMN HOT!!!  Folks, this is New Mexican food, not Mexican. New Mexico is home of the Hatch Chili, which they use... in everything, and not at all sparingly.  YOU WILL FEEL PAIN, especially if you get the green sauce. Deal with it.. or better yet, love it!   This place is for seasoned, professional, iron tongued, steel stomached, sweating and sniffling half way through your meal, true spice connoisseurs.  Other than Thai restaurants that know what they are doing, and a few places with absolutely crazy suicide wings, you will not find burn like this at any other restaurant.  If you don't want spicy food go to one of the chain restaurants and get your boring Mexican food and go on with your boring life and continue writing boring reviews of flavorless places like Olive Garden or Applebees or Garcia's.  Sorry, had to get that out of my system.   What is really fun is to bring folks or clients here from out of town the say the LOVE spicy food. "We'll see", I tell them...  They do have some less spicy alternatives, BUT...  Get the Adovada Burrito with Green Sauce and you will see God. Its a burrito I would punch my mother for. Tell your wimpy friends to get the sauce on the side, it helps control the heat.

Quick update. I've been coming here at least once a month for the past 6 months.   Quality and consistancy are amazing. The adovada is heavenly and seriously addictive.  See original review for thoughts on spice level. :)

This place is a decent alternative to Z Greek if you are in the area and have a gyro craving. VERY meaty (as much as Z). Nice bread (not quite as good as Z, a little doughy). Good fries (Same). Good tzatziki (almost as good as Z). They did charge for it though.  If you've ever been to Z, being in the same ballpark as them is a pretty damn solid review. They are that nerd (me) in class who always screwed up the curve for the rest of the class.  One thing that was pretty funny was the girl who took my order was new and pronounced YEE row as GUY row. F-ing hilarious, especially in a greek place from a worker. The owner was behind her and didn't bat an eyelash, but I give koudos to him not correcting her in front of us.

I travel a good bit for business and use the east economy lot. The sky train is great for a quick transport to terminal 4. Seems to arrive the second I walk up every time. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't take you to any other terminals so leave yourself some time if your airline does not depart from terminal 4 because you have to take a shuttly to access any other terminals. Wait can be 10 minutes sometimes... plus the travel time to get there.

Huh? What? Really???!!!  How is it possible that this outdoor area only has 3 stars? I'm outraged!!!  Wake up Yelpers! Can any of you point me to a better patio in Phoenix?   I'm not reviewing the restaurants (which I do like), not the service, but the outdoor area, WHICH IS AWESOME. Ping pong, bags, tons of SHADED space to just sit and chill, and you can drink while doing it... What's not to love?  When I come, I just go into the bar and get my drinks from the bartender... Quick, easy, no problemo!  I'm thinking that the poor ratings must be from people that were born on some other planet where they must have Ferris wheels and tea cup rides in every back yard, so a patio like this is no big deal.  I strongly suggest you check it out. I also strongly suggest you leave your children at home, or supervise them closely. To me, its a "bar patio", for adults, not a place for kids to be running around. I've never had any problems with this, but can see that it could be an issue.

By the stars you already know this won't be a glowing review. You've got to be BAD to deserve it, especially if you aren't a chain. This place does.  So the story goes... I was attending a seminar downtown and am TRYING to be healthy. I really do enjoy a good salad and was in the mood. I found this place nearby (Using Yelp of course) and was looking forward to it.  I was STARVING when I got there, which would typically sway a review to the positive side, and got one large and one small salad. Hey... I said I was staring...   For the large I got a cobb because I like them about 100% of the time because of the meat, cheese, egg, etc.  This cobb was disgusting. Strong words but it was. Processed chunks of turkey with tasteless turkey bacon on top. No egg but did have avocado. Other than the lettuce and spinach it was the only thing edible. Even the blue cheese dressing which they buy, I'm sure of it, was really bad also. Nonetheless I cleaned my bowl like a good boy but I was really scratching my head because it is rare when Yelp leads me this far astray.   The second salad was going to be good for sure!  So... I dug into it. This one was the "Steak Escape". I was looking forward to it when I ordered it and really looking forward to it after the abomination I just choked down. WOW more like the steak escaped from the frozen food aisle at the Dollar store. It wasn't actually steak, but frozen thin slices of beef that they warmed up, and thoroughly dried out, on the flat top. Kind of like when you get cheesesteak but they didn't even bother to chop it up to make it look appetizing. Just put the flat rectangle on top of the salad along with three or so tomatoes. I don't remember seeing any peppers or onions.   I couldn't believe it was possible but I think it was even worse than the first salad.  Side note: If you want a FANTASTIC, knock your socks off, tell all your friends, beef salad try the Spicy Chicago Beef Salad at Half Moon by the Biltmore. Sooooo good and a good portion (I can only eat one of those)  Now back to D'Lish. This place bills itself as a healthy, kind of hip, place but is churning out processed junk. It's been two weeks and I'm still shaking my head. Disgraceful salads. Really they were.  Oh... the guy at the counter was really strange too. Sweating for no apparent reason and looking shifty. Remember that guy at the pawn shop in the movie Men In Black?... I was waiting for Will Smith to bust in and blast off his head and another, even sweatier one to grow back.  No second chances for this place, especially since I tried two things my first visit.

I FINALLY stopped in to Portillo's on Friday for lunch with a Chicago native that moved to our Phoenix office. I had no idea what to expect other than knowing they took over the old spot that Uncle Sam's used to fill on 91st and Shea.   First off, I COULD NOT BELIEVE how busy it was, especially for a weekday lunch in an area without a large concentration of businesses (I work downtown). Drive through line was a mile long (but seemed to be moving quickly). When we got inside I was shocked at the amount of people cramed into this large space. Not a table to be found and long lines again, but we had made the drive so there was no turning back... Glad we didn't because that line moved quickly also.  My buddy and I both got the "combo" sandwich, which is an Italian Beef with a sausage stuck in there also. Strangly enough my Chicago friend got a chicken sandwich, which apparently he loves there.  Cool thing about the "combo", or just regular beef sandwiches, is you can choose how much "gravy" you want on them. Hardly any, some poured on top, or, and of course the one that I picked, DIPPED. They dip the who damn sandwich in the "gravy" (beef drippings). NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN BOUT.  We got cheese fries too. Fries were good but they put the cheese on the side...kind of a bummer, BUT the sandwiches were excellent... Best Italian Beef I've had other than Luke's of Chicago on Indian School, which is quite a compliment.  We did end up finding seats by the way. Very crowded place, but a lot of turnover, so if you just wait a second something will pop up.  Prices were excellent also. Most sandwiches were right around $5 bucks, even the Halibut fish sandwich, which I gotta try next...I'll be back. Gotta try the dogs too!!  Enjoy

Had an awesome experience in the bar yesterday. Had a few cocktails and appetizers. The duck fat fries were great. I cook my potatoes in bacon fat so I was used to a great flavor. What really topped it off was the poached egg on top.  I'm a total whore for an egg on anything.  Brussels sprouts were darn good and so were the potato-bacon-tot things.  Solid old-fashioneds and nice pours all around.  Open kitchen like I love and the food coming out looked spot on.  Five stars for now. Will review again after I have a meal.  Note that they are not open for lunch on the weekend. BUMMER

YUMMY YUMMY in my TUMMY.  I must say that I have been waiting for this spot to open up for some time now. I must also say that it was a little bit bitter sweet because they are now inhabiting the infamous prior home of Maui Dog (may they rest in peace).   This could have worked out badly for them for a 3 reasons. 1. Typically, when I am REALLY excited about a new spot, I tend to hold them to a higher standard than I normally would. 2. I went into a rather deep depression when Maui Dog went out of business making reason one all the more unfair to this new business. 3. This is a burger and taco place. I will tear your sh-t apart if your food isn't up to snuff. There is some serious competition on the area for both of these major food groups.  To be honest, I went in there thinking, "This place BETTER be GREAT" and thank you Baby Jesus IT WAS.  From the decor, to the menu, to the staff, this place was absolutely great. FYI, it is a very small restaurant but they did an excellent job revamping it. Very slick, with a white, blue and grey motif. They do also have a small patio (near replica to the one at Over Easy in style, but smaller). Oh, they have a drive through too!  The menu was small also, which I like. In sales they teach us to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), and they did just that.  Here's the menu: burger, taco, fries or shake. Me LOVE it.   The burger either comes with cheese or without. I got mine with (duh). Damn it was good. It is more of a double cheese burger. Instead of one fat patty, they use two, with two corresponding layers of yummy cheese.  The style is similar to an In and Out double-double (meat, cheese, toppings, bun, everything), but closer to the size of Del Frisco's cheese burger. If you really want a good comparison, and are lucky enough to have been to the Iconic Manhattan hole in the wall "Burger Joint", this burger is a near exact copy. THIS IS A GOOD THING FOLKS. A VERY good thing!  FYI you can also add bacon, grilled onions, or grilled jalapenos to your burger if you like, but I was feeling plain today and, since it was my first time, wanted to get a feeling for their standard and work up from there.  I've said "I must say" twice in this review already, BUT, I MUST SAY, that I was very impressed.   It is hard for me to swallow (he he) a $15 dollar burger. This quality with this price point was refreshing.  I got fries with my burger that were very good. I ended up sending the first batch back though (I hate doing that) because they were unbelievably salty. I am kind of a salt fiend so if I think something is too salty, it definitely is. They hand cut their fries fresh, and leave the skin on which I think is a nice touch. They do a much better job of this than In and Out does. The salt they use is a cracked sea salt (big chunks, so easy to overdo it) and my first batch was covered. The second batch came out perfectly salted.   To wash it all down I got a Mexican Coke in the bottle which is always fun.  As mentioned, they do offer tacos at about $2.50 each. They have a Chicken, a Veggie, and a Short rib which will be reviewed and devoured after my next visit. Shakes too, but I'm not a sweets guy so you'll have to find info on that elsewhere.  The staff was cheery and as eager to help as I was to eat. I will definitely be back.  See you there soon.  PS, Yelpers GO HERE. Support this small local business. Don't let it fall to the same fate as Maui Dog, R.I.P.

I've just gotten back from my second visit to The Stand and feel inclined to update my first 5 star review to a 4, now having gotten over my "first date" giddiness and tried the tacos.  As promised, I went back today to try them (tacos). Well, they weren't as nearly as good as I had hoped. I ordered one short rib ($3) and one chicken ($2.50), along with another burger (yes, I'm a glutton).  Neither taco came even close to knocking my socks off. Don't get me wrong, both were good, but thats it. The short rib taco was the better of the two, mainly because of the addition of the cotija cheese which was the most flavorful part of either of them.  Both were shredded meat and neither had that punch of flavor I (and every one else) is looking for in a taco. The chicken was a little grainy with much too fine of a shred with almost no flavor. Put some seasoning on that thing!  Short rib is short rib, nearly always great, but theirs lacked that succulent richness that I look for with that type of meat.   They also ask if you want mild or hot salsa ON the taco. I asked for the hot, but on the side because I didn't want the salsa to take over and I had no idea if it was good or not. Boy, I'm glad I asked for it on the side. It is chunky SALSA, not a smooth hot SAUCE, which i prefer on a taco. Excellent for chips, but not on my taco, and it was nowhere NEAR the realm of spicy. My Mom could eat bowls of the stuff.  Considering two stars is "Meh. I've experienced better", these are definately a two. With places like Gallo Blaco out there, the taco battle is a tough one to enter, nearly as tough as the bigger burger war that they have also entered.  I did get a cheeseburger that was as good as the first. Quite good and fresh tasting, and a 5 star burger, but only because of the price point.  Service is also excellent. In fact, couldn't be better with them clearing your plate when you finish and having smiles all around. Definitely 5 stars for that. The place was MUCH busier than last week which is a good thing.  Keep your charm, The Stand. I'll be back, but its burgers only from now on.  A side note... I think us Yelpers can sometimes be TOO picky. I'm guilty of it too for sure. We want EVERY burger to be the best we've ever had, every taco to leave us speachless. Well. I'm not sure that every place is meant for that, or even tries for that. How many stars does good food at a good price garner...? With the competition out there can a place like that even stay in buisness? I dunno. Just something for me to think about I guess.  PS - I do agree that adding the choice of green chilis or a fried egg would be a spendid option. I too and am absolute whore for a fried egg on a burger.

A new bar hits the North West side! My wifey and I know two of these 3 sisters (3 sisters = Times 3) from their past lives at the Heights.   We are so happy for them that they jumped on this opportunity to take it on their own.  I hear the wings are really good, but haven't eaten there yet.   My wifey and I have been there 3 times (really) now and each time the place was full of fun, nice, folks and our service has been great (thanks Melissa!).  I've definitely been overindulging in their $7 for a shot and a beer special. Beer is a domestic tap and the shot is either Jager or Fire Ball. YIKES!  Keep up the good work! See you soon.

This place is excellent. Everything that I want a breakfast place to be. Its like "The Place", but with far superior food. Fast and extremely friendly and informative service, low prices, fresh local ingredients.  If this place was in Arcadia there would be hour long waits. Fresh squeezed navel orange juice. Awesome Coffee. Fresh local Bread. Local jam. Spot on Green chili. Perfectly crispy Hash.   I like the El Paso. A very yummy omelet with chorizo and black beans and veggies. Get an order of green chili on the side and you will be a happy person. My wife is nuts over the french toast.  Its just a small, unassuming, little breakfast place that happens to do things VERY well. You won't find ultra hip music playing, or waitresses with super cute outfits.  Just go here wanting a good breakfast and you will leave getting exactly that. I think it is funny when people set their hopes too high for a breakfast place. I mean really, how good can an egg or hash browns be? In my opinion, this place tops the charts for the things that matter...  Do it right. Do it local. Do it cheap. Do it fast. Do it without an attitude.  If this sounds good to you, Go to OBH and enjoy.

The folks here are great. Since my transfer from disgusting smoker to guy who vapes I've made this my go-to spot.  I'm not an expert on the subject by any means but these guys really take the time to help and be sure that you are getting what you want. They also have tons of great flavors that they let you try before you buy.  Really cool part to me is if you spend a tad more money you are getting "juice" made in Prescott, not that "who knows what is in it" crap from China.  Note that they don't have refills for "Blu's" or other cigarette type vaping devices. Just the refillable kind.

What a great place. Nice showroom and a warehouse full of product.  I just got a puppy so wanted a smaller piece to put on my sideyard. They have remnant pieces that they will sell you at a great discount.  Walked out of there with a prefect small piece for 25 bucks. Thanks!!  Three of my coworkers will be showing up tomorrow. :)

I'm giving this place 5 stars as I have given Bianco and Cibo.   Excellent pizza that nestles itself nicely between the crusts of Bianco and Cibo.  Bianco = paper thin, irregular shaped pies with crunchy (no doughy) crust that's a little burned in a spot with or two with big bubbles and fantastically fresh ingredients  Cibo = crust about as thick as two nickles with the outside wonderfully flavored and small "bubbles" and chewy and fantastically fresh ingredients  Pomo = nickle thick bottom with outside crust right smack in the middle between the above two. Medium bubbles here. Again.. fantastically fresh ingredients. Their slices of pepperoni are thicker but smaller around than the other two  Really just depends on your mood that day. Reasonably priced like the rest and awesome pie.

How does a taco shop get 4 stars off of 150 reviews in one location and absolutely suck in another???  I was happy to see this taco shop open up close(r) to my office. I had heard the good reviews of the other location and had been looking forward to giving it a try, so when this one opened it was a no-brainer.  I love me some tacos... BOY do I love me some tacos.  BOY does this place make a weak one. I got the sampler with one of each. 1 chicken, 1 carne asada, 1 pastor. I ate them in that order and each was less appetizing than the next.  When I got back to the office I called the 7th street location to see if they were affiliated. Apparently this a franchise with each location owned independently, so don't take this review as a review of the one on 7th.  It is good to note though, that this IS a franchise. Usually not a good sign. I'm not sure what the other location looks like, but this location was a bright and steril looking place like Baja Fresh (who makes much better tacos by the way, but everywhere makes better tacos than this place.). Decades of ruthless taco devouring experience has made me instinctually prefer a seedy looking establishment where English is definitely a second language as a sign that a good taco is about to be served. Some chipper gringo high school girl was at the counter of this establishment.  I've had MUCH better tacos at taco bell and Carl's Jr. Sad sad sad.  Meat was dry, seasonings flopped, dry thick corn tortillas. I still ate them... they were still tacos after all. They were the worst I've had in quite a long time. This is extra nuts because I got there at 11:45 to beat the lunch rush. Usually this means everything is extra hot and fresh. um...nope.  No wonder the place was empty... even when I left at 12:30. Wonder what the next restaurant at this location will be?

Been here twice now and had an excellent experience both times.  First visit I had the shrimp po boy. Perfectly cooked shrimp and a perfectly soft bun for that type of sandwich. Shoe string fries are don perfectly. I also got a side of the cheese and jalapeno grits which were pretty darn good.  Second visit I got the braised short ribs. HOLY CRAP. Best short ribs I've ever had. Very nice portion and the meat... oh the meat... SO damn tender and juicy. Only forks needed for this dish. Had a side of their slaw also. Interesting mix with a light "sauce" which consisted of only cabbage and parsley. Slather on the Crystal hot sauce they have on the tables and it was damn good.  Hear from others the fish sandwich is also exceptional. Its on the same bread as the po boys. Perfect for a delicate sandwich.  Salads looked great too. Nice portions.  Enjoy.

Valentin is a fantastic tailor who can make anything from scratch, alter suits and make your favorite pants fit better again. He's done several things for me over the years and his work is exceptional. Get that old stuff out of the closet and bring it over.

My wife just had a Pea Coat tailored by Valentine (owner of Valenti Custom Tailoring). She is thrilled with the fit. Another great job.

Scratching my head on all the people complaining about the price. This is a RESTAURANT, not a drive through like In-n-Out where you get your burger in 8 seconds.   My wife and I went on Sunday afternoon. We got a cheeseburger, chicken sandwich, and shared a cheese fries. The total bill was $16 bucks. Seems like a value to me.  Both the burger and chicken sandwich were awesome and a good size. This is not like what you would get at In-n-Out where I can power down two double doubles without batting an eyelash. One double here would more than satisfy me here.  The beef was delicious and props to the girl at the counter who asked if we wanted pickle and onion on it... YES. The pickles are bomb and whoever does the buns should get a nice pat on the back. Perfect size and tooth to not fall apart with the juicy as hell burger and nice gooey cheese.  Chicken sandwich was spot on. I think Chick Filet has a great, simple chicken Sammy. This was just like that, but with a better, lighter, batter to it. Yum.  Last is the cheese fries. Hate to admit it, but I love some cheese fries with the standard runny "nacho" cheese. Prefer them that way. The cheese on these babies knocked my socks off. It had that gooeyness that I covet but the flavor far surpasses my wildest cheesy dreams. Such a nice refined chedar/irish cheddar flavor... I need this recipe because it would also make the perfect mac and cheese.  FIVE BIG STARS all the way for Shake Shack.
