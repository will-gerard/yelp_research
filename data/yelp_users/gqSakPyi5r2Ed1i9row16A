Crazy busy street to walk on to get here.  You can tell this used to be a fast food joint.  On the outside, it is not so inviting.  GO INSIDE.  GO.  Lunch time was groovy.  The seafood soup is a coat of warmth.  I only did the broth.  The even leave the shells in it. LEGIT.  I am a carb loving fool.  Anyone that is happy in life knows that carbs are what makes the world go round.   RICE ME.  Yep.  I took that plate down like they were taking me to the electric chair.  Balls to the walls awesome.  I even ate it with chicken.  It is something I am trying, chicken.  Whatever.  It was super tender.  Veggie Heaven.  The best part, you ready.  I do this at home on my dishes.  FRESH BASIL.....on hot anything, breaks it down.  On the bite you devour, pops all in your head and just makes dining that much more enjoyable.  Service was groovy.  Huge lot for free parking, hard to come by in the PHX.  Valet here and there.  Give me a break.   I hate touristy crap.  So I was happy I found this spot.  Thanks Yelp.  Great Vacayyyy...Hey.

Basically a Chilis.  The service was eh.   Only two tables of people in here and it took 15 min to get service.  It smelled like cleaner.    It was freezing inside.  But the food was great!  All the beef dishes are excellent.  Just stick with that.

Street Taco HEAVEN!  The pork, and the beef.  ASADA ME.  Grilled Cactus and Homemade salsa.  AND CHEAP!   I am wasting your precious time.  Just trust.    However parking is minimal.  4 spots in the front.  Building is up on a hill next to the mechanic shop.
