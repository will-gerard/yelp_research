Just checked out this restaurant for the first time and, OMG, Fabulous! The place was very busy, which to me, usually means the food is really good. We were greeted by the owner, Dawn, who is quite the delight. We waited no longer than 10 minutes before we got sat. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. Our drinks were always full and I could see that pretty much everybody elses drinks were full as well.   We had the breakfast (I had the Mediterranean Omelet, my husband had the Green chili omelet) and we were both thoroughly impressed. The food was delicious! I would certainly recommend 5th Ave Cafe to anybody interested in a tasty breakfast.   I have not tried the lunch yet, but their lunch menu looks great. I will definitely be back to check out their lunch and have their breakfast again.   Great staff, very inviting, wonderful food!

I was craving a gyro and went to yelp to help me give me some ideas. Due to all the great comments about the food, I had made my decision and decided to try it out for myself. Well.... very happy I did. Food was great! Lots of meat and the salad was delicious! Although the place is not very pretty to look at, the food is well worth it. What's even better, it's super close to my house. I will definitely be going back!

First off, they have no prices on their mailed menus or online, other than specials. And, when I called the kid who picked up was not friendly AT ALL! I decided to order the $16.99 pick 3 special, which I had a coupon for from Hungry Howies. When the rude kid gave me the total he said it was $24.+ . I asked why it was so much and he told  that the price had changed to $18.99 . I said, "well I have a non-expired coupon for $16.99." He then said, "well, the price has changed." I asked to speak to a manager. Manuel (supervisor) got on the phone. I told him I had a coupon and asked that since it was from Hungry Howies and there is no expiration date on it, will they honor it. He, at first said "no",then said "ok, that's fine, I'll go ahead and give it to you at $16.99. Not a big deal"   I chose not to purchase the "deal" only because I was unsure of what they might do to my food. I did tell Manuel that the kid who I originally spoke with was rude and very unfriendly.   I will no longer order pizza or any other "deal" from Hungry Howies. It was very upsetting to have to argue with staff and manager about honoring a unexpired coupon from their own company.
