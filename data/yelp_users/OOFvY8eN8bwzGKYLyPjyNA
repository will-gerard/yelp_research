Just love this place! I dont get over much anymore but when I do it is consistently amazing , clean, and wonderful friendly service- not to mention the food is FABU! Yoshi (owner) always does a great job making sure everyone is taken care of and will participate in your celebrations on occasion. Keep up the great work guys!

So I returned here for a quick lunch today after probably 8 years and have to say I was sadly disappointed... I remember this being "the Place" to get amazing Thai food and it is clear to see that the owners are running themselves ragged trying to manage this place today.. The restaurant is dated, not clean and disorganized, giving an unwelcome feel. To top that off, the Masuman I had was blah and the chicken was dry and overcooked.. Buffet wasn't looking great either. I hope they get the help they need to make this place what is use to be.

I had previously been here and was dissatisfied .. environment was hot and sticky and service was less than par at that time (2012), food was just okay. I never returned because the staff/owners there were just plain rude and off putting.. But this week, I was in a pickle and needed some food so I decided to stop in again. This time it was different... it is under new ownership and they have made some aesthetic changes but are still working on fine tuning things. I met the owner who was very nice  , I ordered a gyro plate with Greek salad and all was delish! I really couldn't complain even though I had previously had a negative association with this place. I wish them luck and hope to see it improve and be vibrant again!

One Word sums up this place- AMAZING!!! I don't care if you are a carnivore or a vegan this place has something for everyone and everything is DELISH!! It does take a little longer than most places but its worth it. Small and quaint with simple ambiance, but a little gem that offers a nice variety and daily specials - Also, their RAW desserts are insanely good and good for you!

Love the detail that the staff includes , even on a basic wash and always offer a great deal for other services as well. They do take time to get in the cracks and crevices and do a fabulous job, so plan on being patient as its well worth it!!

So my dear friend stopped in here today while I waited in the car... He asked for some info on renting a Tux for his upcoming wedding and the person basically booted him out of the store !! Not sure if hes the owner or what but he conducted himself very poorly... When my friend inquired , the store worker stated he didnt feel he was in there as a serious customer and told him he had 2 seconds to vacate the store. I was so baffled by this I had to report so that others will know this place is NOT friendly or worthy of any decent persons business.

Visited HOB for lunch this week to check out the new menu,ownership etc.. Love the new ambiance and vibe -  the place is definitely on the up & up! Ordered the Spinach salad, it was very tasty, fresh chicken and avocado was delightful. They also have upcoming events and a boatload of big screens to watch ALL the games, not to mention the multitude of craft beers they have on draft... I'll be back for sure!
