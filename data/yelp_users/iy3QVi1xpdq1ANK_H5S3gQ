I ordered the sweet and sour shrimp and egg foo young and was dissapointed with the lack of flavor, the dry texture and the overall quality. I have good interactions with an employee there, so I added a star.  The egg foo young was a dry, flavorless, seemingly premade patty. The sauce was alright, the chicken and veggies were good. Part of my disappointment is that I prefer a freshly made patty with the veggies and meat mixed in and a slightly thinner sauce.  The sweet and sour shrimp wasn't high in flavor and was dry and could have used some more sauce.  I believe I was dissapointed with the food the last time I ordered there as well, so I'm going to have to scratch this restaurant off of my list. It seems a lot of people like this place, so maybe it's just that my preferences don't mesh with this restaurant's output.

I love Thai Basil and this location especially, despite its small size! Love the intimate atmosphere created by the low lights, soft music unobtrusively playing in the dinning area and the medium stained woods and browns of the decor.  The food is fresh, tastes amazing, and even when they're super busy, comes out fast. I think this is the best Thai I've ever tasted.   The staff is always friendly and seem good about anticipating the needs of their customers.   Tonight, my friend from out of town ordered the glass noodle soup with tofu and I had the green curry with tofu. He really liked the food and managed to finish his soup even though he had some of my curry and he typically doesn't eat much. He said it was so good he had to finish it.   He even suggested that we come back again some time while he's in town! I will definitely be back and will try to bring my friend one more time before he leaves.

The price of $2 is fabulous for a treat and the woman that put together my order was friendly and helpful, so these aspects should garner a higher rating, but the blandness of the cookies (one chocolate chip and one peanut butter) and the ice cream were a major disappointment. If I'm going to consume the (I assume high-ish) calories, I want to be wowed by the flavors.   I recommend giving this place a try anyway because everyone has different tastes and it seems like a lot of people like this place.

I went with some friends on a Friday night, and I got the German special of the day, a bratwurst in a bun with a side of sauerkraut and spicy German mustard, dumpling soup, potato salad and a drink for eight dollars. I shared some of my soup with a friend and gave her half of the potato salad and was still stuffed! The potato salad was the best I've ever had and the owner told us that it's made with mustard and a little oil instead of mayo. It had bits of bacon in it and that made it it so yummy! I'll definitely be back to try the other German specials and see how the owner's menu will grow (sounds like she has some tasty plans!)
