Everyone is very friendly, excellent customer service, quality coffee. I always order an iced americano  from Starbucks and haven't found another coffee shop that is as good until now. Luckily, there were no Starbucks on the way to work so I had to try something new. It's way better!!! Highly recommend!!

We have always enjoyed the Phoenix location but the Avondale location is terrible. I went there today and got fajitas, Chile con queso, and a soda to go. They brought my soda and it literally tasted like it had insect spray in it....so did the guacamole. Maybe it was the foam cups, I'm not sure, but I have been sick to my stomach ever since, headache, and feeling horrible. I do not recommend eating here. Something is wrong with the food.

I got food poisoning from their food after talking to the hostess about the poor service we received. They were very rude and,  I'm guessing,  did something to my food.  Horrible experience!

We've been to this location three timed and are apprehensive about going back. Our family has always loved Texas Roadhouse but this location has left a lot to be desired.  First visit, too busy and no one even talked to us about getting our name on the list.  Second visit, they inverted how each one of us wanted our steak cooked, didn't bring requested steak sauce, and overall poor service.  Third visit, very poor service AND there were long hairs in not one but TWO dishes we were served. My nice got a hair in her salad which we tried to move past but it was followed up with a hair in her chicken. Plus, the chicken on my salad was pink and squishy. Terrible experience. The manager apologized and gave us a gift card which was nice but it will be a while before we are able to go back and give it another chance. Ugh!

This couldn't have been a bigger  disappointment! I would NOT attend the food festival again. The website had pictures of all kinds of interesting foods but when we got there it was nothing but food you would find at a fair or carnival. The vendors were "subject to change" but come on! Funnel cake, barbeque, fry bread, frozen lemonade.... Blah blah blah....   I paid extra money for an express pass so we wouldn't have to wait in long lines because there were supposed to be separate lines for buying food, sampling, and express passes. However, there was one long line for every vendor and every sample. Everyone who bought an express pass should be refunded! This event couldn't have been more disorganized!  Food was not amazing, lines were ridiculous, and it wasn't at all what it was advertised to be.
