I recently moved near Chizona and was excited to get a taste of Chicago. Being from Illinois I've had plenty of food from Chicago and was expecting the pizza to be deep dish but the thin crust style was still very good. I plan on trying more of their foods but as of right now I can say that the pizza is worth a try.

I've been going here a little over a year now and absolutely recommend Dr. Carr and his team if you are looking for a great dentist. Everyone in the office is extremely friendly. The receptionist is very helpful with scheduling future visits but she is also great at explaining any procedures or answering any questions you have. Leah, the dental hygienist, is awesome and has helped a lot with brushing habits and making sure my oral health is on point. My experiences here have all been stellar and I don't plan on switching dentists anytime soon.

First 5 star review for me. I don't think many businesses deserve the 5 star rating because there is usually something that can be improved. Not here. Tott's is delicious, well priced, served fast and fresh.  I've had a wide range of their menu items from the Thai based dishes to the Chinese dishes. Everything is great. Definitely somewhere you should go.

I have been here twice within the last week and both times the food has been excellent. I really love Thai food so I think most places are great but Yupha's is definitely worth checking out over some of their competition.   At first I was a bit worried because it is kind of tucked away in a strip mall so I was expecting business to be slow. Both times I have been in for lunch it has been very crowded. I have tried their red curry and pad Thai and both were very good.   Only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because after getting our food I didn't see our server again until we got our check. I am not someone that wants to be constantly approached by the staff but a simple "is there anything else you need?" Or "how is everything" would make up that little difference. I ordered my food Thai hot and ran out of water. It would have been nice to have had someone check in and refill our carafe.  All in all the place is great and I will definitely be back.

Love this place. Unfortunately I'm not in Tempe as often as I used to be so don't get to eat here as often as I'd like. The tikka masala fries are awesome as is pretty much everything I've tried from here. Its very well priced compared to some other Indian places I've eaten. I'm giving it 4 stars because I do think there is some room for improvement. For the price its great but I have had better Indian food. Definitely recommend trying it sometime.

Literally just finished eating the tri tip sandwich. Must say it was quite delicious. I went with the spicy bbq sauce which had a great flavor and wasn't overly spicy. I am definitely going to be back to try some more of the menu.  Not a 5 star simply because of the ambiance of the restaurant. Food was really good though so I'd recommend checking it out. Compared to the other bbq I've had in AZ this was great.

Had a minor collision where I was rear ended and there was some damage to my back bumper. Having been in a few accidents in the past I was reluctant to have to go through the process of finding a repair place and get everything fixed because of the headaches typically involved. I was told about BumperDoc by a friend and the process couldn't have been better. Quick, friendly, and affordable. Can't ask for much more when dealing with the unpleasantries of going through an auto accident.

I am surprised this venue has such good reviews...I've only been once but I firmly believe that any watering hole that includes cocktails or spirits in their name should at the very least be able to make a decent libation.    Perhaps I found the 1 bartender there who never heard that an old fashioned includes an orange peel and not a muddled mess of an orange, club soda, and Bourbon.   I only give this place 2  because the decor is on point and the place has potential. Get some mixologists and fix the probs
