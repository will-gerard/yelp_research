While eating in the restaurant, I saw one of their employees yell at two customers (who looked to me like professional women) and refused to sell them the cake they had picked out.  I called to report this to a manager, and it turns out it was the owner who had thrown them out.  She said they had made a rude comment about her to an employee, but I didn't see that, just her coming out from the back with the cake, refusing to write on it or sell it to them.  She told them she didn't need their business.  Very strange!

UBBC is definitely not closed - weird! I found Ultimate Body Boot Camp through Groupon - I thought it was a great deal. I chose the Windgate Crossing location, and it is definitely a challenging workout! What I love the most is that Ray gives a challenging workout, pushes you to do the best you can, but isn't obnoxious or in your face like the other boot camp I went to in North Phoenix. He's tough in a way that is motivating, not discouraging. I also love how Richelle, the owner, is so smart about nutrition. I have tried diet after diet over the years, talked to nutritionists, etc. and I learned more from Richelle about how eating affects your body than I did from anyone else.
