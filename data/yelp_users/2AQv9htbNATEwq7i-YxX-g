Great people watching, dive bar-esque. One time we were in, the karaoke DJ dedicated feel like making love. To his mother for Mother's Day. No joke. If you're cool with watching your bartender eat food and snack on fruit non stop behind the bar and don't care about unevenly padded barstools, this is your place!

The pizza was gross. We tried to get away from the typical chains and tried this place. The pizza crust was tasteless, soggy and gross! We couldn't pick up the pizza slices to eat because of the soggy factor, but it was next to impossible to cut into bite size pieces because it was tough. So weird,  Won't be back.

Unbelievable staff!!! From the tour of the maternity ward to my labor and delivery here to the 2 week NICU stay this hospital is amazing!!!! The special nursery nurses hold a very special place in my heart for the amazing care they provided for my twin girls born at 35 weeks. They were so attentive and made me feel so absolutely comfortable leaving the hospital to care for my 8 year old daughter at home. The lactation nurse Teresa was absolutely phenomenal as well! Being able to have a nesting room to be close to my girls and be able to rest and pump was so absolutely amazing. These ladies are absolutely amazing and I couldn't be more grateful or happier with the way my family was cared for. Thank you banner baywood OB nurses and neonatal doctors!!!

My husband and I came here for my bday and our anniversary dinner. I just had twins a few months ago so I hadn't had sushi in almost a year! Way too long to wait if you ask me!!! We got a table on the patio and ordered a ton of sushi off the happy hour menu. Service is what you would expect during a busy happy hour, not horrible but not fantastic either. We had to ask for bowls for our soy sauce twice, which sucked waiting to dig in to my sushi after such a long wait! Sushi was decent as were the prices. We'll be back, celebration or not.

Came here for a lunch date with daughter and we had the absolute best service on top of always fantastic food! Melissa our server was super friendly, engaged us in conversation, never let us run out of drinks, promptly delivered our food and managed to not make us feel like she was lingering. she even offered us drinks to go and boxed our food for us. On top of it all, the manager (pete, i believe) bought our pizza cookie for absolutely no reason! they made my special lunch date with my daughter that much better! thank you Oregano's, Melissa, and Pete! We will see you again soon!

I just came here to buy boxes and tape, the guys were helpful and helped me carry the two bundles of boxes to my truck. They even recommended buying the brown tape vs. the clear tape and dispenser and I absolutely grateful for that! It saved my ears the annoying ripping of the tape and was so easy to use and super strong!  I didn't use everything I bought and the return was super easy, they just needed the card I made the original purchase on. Piece of cake!  Thanks guys!

I LOVE this place!!! The first time I visited my husband and I ate downstairs then went upstairs to lounge for a glass of wine and to listen to the live music. Our bartender was great and was our server.  Second time around we stopped in to have a glass of wine in the lounge. They had live music (even on a Tuesday!) It was a charming piano man singing the jazzy crooner tunes. They even sang happy birthday to me and brought me a delicious piece of tiramasu. Keep in mind we just had a few glasses of wine, no dinner! Our bartender was absolutely fantastic. Upon realizing we didn't have cash and wanted to tip the piano player, the bartender let us have cash from his drawer and we just added that amount to his tip.    I will absolutely be back! This is our favorite date night spot!!!

I really only come here for Taco Tuesday. Sometimes it's just myself and my husband, other times we have as many as 15. Service is pretty decent, they are great about splitting checks. They have food runners bring out the food so it's always a food auction. But, for dollar tacos, who can complain? The salsa is on the watery side, but it definitely has good flavor and doesn't stop me from eating it. It's nice that it's complimentary as well.   I don't get here as often anymore because we moved from old town, but we still make the drive sometimes for taco Tuesday!

I love this walmart, the only reason it's not 5 star for me is because it's really hard to maneuver with 12 week old twins and they don't stock very much of the formula I use. So i end up going to an additional grocery store to get what I need. and by not stocking much, I mean even if I only had one baby. I use similac neosure because my babies were born prematurely. They typically don't have more than a few cans...   The staff is nice and clean, and so are the people shopping here. It's very clean and always busy. I make the drive from the moon valley area so you know thay're doing something right!

Took me 5 months to get my bridesmaid dress. Ordered nov. 1 and got it a week before the wedding on April 6th. Good thing I didn't need to have it altered. I called 3 times to check on the delivery of my dress, each time was promised a call back that never came. Another bridesmaid had a nightmare experience with them as well.

Everyone here is very friendly and I love the selection of annuals in the garden section. I super super love the kids carts that look like a race car! As a mom of toddler twins, this is a life saver and makes me able to bring the kiddos with!

Everything is always in sale and the staff are super friendly! If you search the clearance racks in the way back you can find some steals! For example, 2 pair of leggings for $4.99 and tshirts for $2.99. They have table with building blocks which is a great way to distract my kids so I can shop! We love desert ridge, and this store is one of the reasons I do!

This place is awesome! I called a few days before visiting to find out if they had the models I was looking for in stock, they weren't. But nobody else had them either. Phill informed me that they had placed an order for them and I could call everyday and check to see if they arrived. 2 days later, we stopped in. They had 1 of 3 models I was looking to buy. We loved one of the models so much we thought it would be perfect for my sis in law. We obviously needed 2, phill got right on the phone and called to the other store. Luckily they had one! He had them hold it for me. Sis in law came in, he gave her amazing service and she left happy and we headed to the other store for my new piece. I will definitely be back to this store. Thank you phill!!!!

5 bucks to clean a suit, done the same day. Great price, great turn around, could have been pressed a little better. Oh well!

I love this place! awesome food, great beer/wine selection. A really relaxed atmosphere. Thursdays they have .75 ice scream scoops, and they're kid friendly. Generous pour when you order a glass of wine, always a good thing in my book!  Jenna and Brooklyn are the only two that have served us and both and fantastic!!!

Super sweet waitress! Free burger for my bday. My 8 year old daughter loves this place so we'll be back! I have 12 week old twins and the staff was very accommodating, even opening the door when we arrived and left. Not bad for a chain restaurant!

Made an appt for the Genius Bar and still waited 30 minutes to be seen. The guy I dealt with was nice enough but didn't listen to my concerns and I left without the problem being fixed. Went to the arrowhead store and Sean listened to me and had my problem fixed ASAP. It was actually a bad charger, which is what I thought but the first guy refused to test it and told me there was no way that could be the problem. Won't be back to this location.

Made an appt. for the Genius Bar online, showed up and waited 5 minutes. That's it! Sean came right out, listened to my problem, diagnosed it and fixed it! Out in under 30 minutes!!! Much better than my experience at the Scottsdale quarter location. Thank you sean!!!

Came here with a wedding party to get a polish change. Went with the gel, first time experience. Paid 20 bucks, gave a 5 dollar tip. Keep in mind that was just a polish change, not a manicure. The color picked was light pink. 2 days later the color was nude with highlighter pink tips. Not impressed. Won't be back and feel like I overpaid for what I got. It's been  a week and a half and its peeling at my cuticles and 2 nails of my nails have broken. Ugh!

Best pedicures ever!!! Skip the manicure cause your nails will chip within an hour of leaving the salon, which sucks when you get your nails done to go one vacation and your nails look worse than before because half the nail polish chips off before the end of the 3rd day.
