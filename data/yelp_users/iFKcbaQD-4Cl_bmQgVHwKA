I have been in the industry for years and I really don't like giving reviews like this. I really enjoy the food and have been here many times over the years, but the service I received tonight was bad and it was only a to-go order. I understand the restaurant was very busy for a Thursday night, but I tried calling four times and never got an answer. When I informed the manager who took my order once I arrived he just shrugged and said 'It's busy'. The food came out in a timely manner. When I arrived back to collect my order, there was no hostess/host at the front door for at least three minutes. Once I was greeted, the service was very impersonal. I am just disappointed with my experience and I am glad I took the food to-go. I really enjoy the food here, and I really hope that this review doesn't fall on deaf ears. Service really needs to improve, even on unusually busy nights.

How can you beat a Starbucks where everybody knows you.  Everybody is great and it's what keeps me going back when there are so many others I could be going to.

Absolutely killer!! Try mixing the short rib with the cornbread for a sweet and smokey flavor in your enchiladas. First time in, but definitely not my last. Good value for the quality.

What a great addition to the neighborhood. This is one of the only places in the Camelback Corridor to serve rare or hard to find craft beers and they serve Silver Oak Cab and The Prisoner by the glass!! Not to mention that you can pay for your drink and take it shopping throughout the store.
