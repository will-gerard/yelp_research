Been wanting to try this place. Casual, clean and friendly. My partner and I were really hungry so we tried a number of items and loved them all!  I especially loved the Japanese Curry Chicken. I will go back and recommend this restaurant to friends!

Always get courteous service and a clean car. I use them as my primary car wash service. Great choice!

Poor, poor service. Went to their clinic for a severe leg injury. Was told they would refer me to a specialist. The MRI came back showing more damage than expected. The referral never came through. The back office failed to forward my referral to my insurance and the front office lied to cover it up. I have been promised results and an accountability call by the clinic and it has not happened. I have internal bleeding and severe pain but it doesn't seem to concern the staff. They just want me off of the phone. This borders on malpractice I will likely report this to every web site they are on. I can understand a mistake, but when no effort is shown to correct it and get back to me, this is unacceptable.
