Ordered the Luv It Special with whipped cream (custard any flavor sundae with any topping, pecans and a cherry).   This was such a great sundae!   If I lived in Las Vegas, iwould go here way too often.  The sundae was huge too!  It is actually perfect to share.  So yummy!!

I took a quick stop here for a few groceries.  I stopped at the Starbucks at the front of the store for an iced coffee then I got my groceries from the produce aisle.  Not a lot of organic produce unfortunately.  The selection was good other than that.  My checker was extremely friendly and nice.  I thought this was a nice store.

This property is on the edge of the strip ( north end).  I would have preferred to be in the middle or the south end.  I think that was the only downfall for me.  The property was beautiful and comfortable.  We were in a studio which is a normal hotel room but with a mini kitchen with everything you need.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.  Taxis were easy to get.  The pool and pool bar area are both very nice and big.  There is no casino.   Free WiFi is always a plus.

Delicious pizza!   We got Nicole's favorite.  It was soooo good.   I love thin crust pizza and this pizza was among my favorites.  I only wished that the crust was crispier.   I would definitely eat here again next time we are in Scottsdale.  Yum!

I went in for an umbrella for our umbrella stroller but they didn't have it.  However, I had three of the nicest employees helping me out which I greatly appreciated.  I have never had a bad experience at Buy Buy Baby and I hope that trend continues!

We went here for lunch because it was near an arts and wine festival we were attending.  It took FOREVER for our drink order then for our food order.  They were busy but not that busy for our table to be ignored.  The food was not that great.  I had a patty melt with fries.  I wouldn't eat there again.

Horrible service.   We waited 10 minutes before we were acknowledged and given a menu.   We had onion rings and split a bbq wrap.  The onion rings were good but the wrap was not.   Our waiter was a joke.  I don't recommend.  This was really our only option near our gate.
