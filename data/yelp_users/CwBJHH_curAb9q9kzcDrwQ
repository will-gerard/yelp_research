I just got an eight week old Dobie (Saber) and though I have a regular vet, I needed a different one to get his ear docked.  I was very uncomfortable with the whole idea until I researched online and read that it is the best way of preventing frequent, painful ear infections. I was recommended first by my own vet to The Saguaro Vet Clinic.  Then upon researching the net, there are only a few vets that do the procedure. Here's the referral part. I was SO impressed at how much time Dr. Mike spent with me going over picture after picture and all my questions to make me feel so secure in my decision. He spent 45 minutes with us, being sure to know that we were comfortabe and on the same page. Thank you Dr. Mike for doing such a great job!  He has experienced NO PAIN and his new look appears to have given him confidence!  I was told that his foam inserts would only last a couple days.  It's been 6 days and he doesn't even notice them!  I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Mike at the Saguaro Veterinary Clinic for anyone looking to find the perfect place for ear docking as well as any vet services.  The entire office seemed to truly be interested and care about my little Saber. I think he must have met each and everyone there on his first visit!

We live in the neighborhood and get take out from Rosati's weekly and consider it a treat! The thin crust pizza is always crisp and the sauce is fantastic!  We also love the hot Italian Beef and Meatball Subs. We don't expect anything more than a great pizza place. Service may be slow but it's worth the wait!  All good things take time. If I want fast food, I'll hit a drive-thru!

Tonight was the second time I've been here. The first time we were the only ones in the restaurant. We had a party of 8. The food was good but when the bill came, all the meals were 5 cents higher than on the menu. I know 5 cents, no big deal. Its the principle!  We were given the excuse that the prices went up but the new menus weren't in. Did I mention there were four different menus?  Then, they were cleaning to close all around us as if to say we would like you to leave. So I decide to give them one more chance. Here we are, two weeks later with another group of 8. Again, the food was fantastic but one of the girls was charged $1.05 extra and another was charged for an item she never got and again, we were all charged the extra 5 cents, per item!  To top it off, the temperature in the restaurant was about 80 degrees. We were all sweating bullets. It's too bad.  We loved the atmosphere and food but the owners are not what I'd call warm and fuzzy by any means. We will not be going back to Cafe Pino again. There are too many warm and inviting places to take our regular biweekly group.

As a fellow hair stylist myself, I highly recommend Charlotte!  Last year, my regular stylist of 8 years left our salon. I know, it sounds crazy, but that was very traumatic for me!  Like a lot of people, the anxiety of finding a new stylist is very difficult. I went 5 months of letting my hair grow before Charlotte offered to get my hair back in shape. She does a great job on my hair and I've been getting lots of compliments on my new color and style!  Thanks Charlotte!

I must say I was excited to go to Emily's. our favorite meal out is always Sunday brunch. When we walked in the ambiance was absolutely charming, clean, and inviting.  For this, I give it both stars.  We chose a seat by the window, with a pretty view of a fountain. That's where the good part ends. When we ordered mimosas to start the server informed us the have pomegranate fruity ones. No problem, I love a good mimosa. When it was delivered it seriously tasted like a very rich fruit juice. I asked her to please top my glass off with champagne and she brought me less than an ounce in a flute. Totally ripped off on the   My husband ordered an omelet and  I ordered the eggs Benedict, potatoes crispy. I emphasized CRISPY!  When the food was delivered our potatoes must've been soaked in olive oil before cooking. They were soggy but flavorful, albeit super fattening.   My Benedict had a slice of tomato between the Canadian bacon and the muffin so my muffin was totally soggy!  My husband said his omelet was ok but no where near as good as all the other places around. I'm surprised because they are located across the street to our favorite breakfast place (The General Store) which has great quality food at a good price. Ok, so back to the final check!  It came to $49!  Those mimosas with little to no champagne cost $10 each!!  If I had know that I would not have ordered. I would only pay that much if they were unlimited. We will definitely NOT be back!

Michel and Patrick did an amazing job on my tile floors. They had not been professionally cleaned in over 10 years, and now they look like new again!  Michel was very friendly and went above and beyond with details and service. Patrick was very friendly and worked hard to please this picky girl!  I felt that they were incredibly well priced and weren't trying to oversell the up sell, if ya know what I mean. Thank you for a job well done!  On a side note, I have a custom made leather living room set that I thought was completely ruined by two sets of renters, but Michel was able to give me a referral to someone that was an expert with leather. I love getting reputable referrals!  I would highly recommend Hydro Care Services to anyone!  In fact I referred them to my neighbor already!
