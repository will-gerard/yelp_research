I had ordered delivery because of my business near by and having my special needs daughter with me it takes a lot to get her in the car and back and forth so. I had ordered online to make sure my order was not messed up. Well I got my food, and they forgot my spinach on my pizza and they also did not have my salad dressing. When I had called to,let them know at 1st the lady on the phone told me there was NO spinach on the order, I had told her I am looking on my ONLINE receipt that tells me there is and was CHARGED for it. She muted the phone and made it right to offer me a free meal next time. Pretty good food but did not care to be told I did not order something on a pizza when CLEARLY it was stated on my ONLINE receipt. ?
