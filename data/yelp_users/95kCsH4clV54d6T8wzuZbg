Horrible pizza, paid $20 for a large pizza and the mushrooms are from a can. I rather have purchased a pizza from the grocery store for $10

Worst bartender service I have ever had. Bartender walks out of back looks at me and walks back in the back doesn't smile or ask if I would like a drink after sitting for another few minutes I yell in the back and asks if I can get a drink she tells me to wait I wait another minute Nothing that's the last time I'll go back

Make sure you don't sit by the fire pit we sat for 20 minutes without any service. The waiter said the cut off to get sevice is the last picnic table . If you are a customer it shouldn't matter where you are to get good service
