I'm a loyal patron of Steve's Krazy Subs, so i don't want to get involved in a family rivalry.  However, sandwiches are my business and they deserve a fair critique regardless.  At first approach, Neds is much more of a professional looking sub shop.  Nice large dining area, clean, fancy tables (*more on those in a minute) I was glad to see that Neds had the same lunch special...8 in poorboy, chips and drink.$1 more at Neds, but you get bigger chips.  Tasted exactly the same, so tough to compare.  My only complaint is the booths.  Probably great if you are 6'5, but for common folk, pretty uncomfy.

Lives up to the hype.  Unique setting in that you order and pay at the counter and then take a number to your table, a la Carls Jr.  However, the service was great and the food was excellent.  We had the flank steak and chicken sandwhich.  The steak was full of flavor and the chicken was tasty as well.  Definitely looking forward to going back and trying some other items on the menu.

Been wanting to try this place out for some time and finally had the opportunity today.  I didn't expect much of a crowd on a Friday morning, however when we pulled in I was shocked to see about 10 people waiting outside.  Typical for a weekend morning breakfast joint.....but a weekday?  This place must be good.  Suprisingly, the wait was short...they obviously know how to handle a crowd at this place.  Once inside, I was impressed.  Pretty small, but we had plenty of room in our booth.  I ordered the eggs and sausage, which came with toast and potatoes. The food came out quick.  The thing that really set it apart was the meat.... this was no Jimmy Dean.  It was worthy of Abe Frohman, Sausage King of Chicago.  Needless to say, I'm looking forward to going back and trying some more items on the menu.

It is with much regret that I give a 2 star review.  Me and Chuys go way back, like 17 years way back.  Many visits while in college in Tucson and then many a visit while living in Simi Valley, Ca.  Nothing but great experiences.  Now that I am back in AZ, I was longing for a taste of some old memories and went out of my way for a lunch at good ol' Chuys.  The decor made me feel right at home.  The tacky airbrushed paintings, silly wood cut out silloute booths and countless 5 star margarita propaganda.  I ordered my all time fave fish tacos and then headed to the self serve chips and salsa bar.  The chips looked a little stale, but I was in a forgiving mood.  However, when my meal arrived I was suprised not to see the tacos I was used to.  They tasted decent, but not what I was expecting.  My guess is that this location must be a franchise.  It was dead quiet during lunch, so obviously it isn't a favorite of the local crowd.

Just ok.  Nothing to go out of your way for.  I had the chicken combo plate.  I was hoping to find the so called "hole in the wall" that is an undiscovered gem, but nothing but average.

What's the big deal with this place?  After reading all these rave reviews I thought I was missing out on the meat mecca of the east valley.  I decided to check out the restaurant for a quick lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The parking lot was packed, which is always a good sign.  After first making my way into what turned out to be the bakery I made a wrong turn into the meat market.  I finally found my way into the restaurant and was seated at a tiny 2 top in between a bunch of old folks.    Not that I have anything wrong with old people, but I was there for lunch and I think they were there for an early supper!!!  I had the turkey sanwhich, which was good but nothing better than I could have made myself.  I think next time I'll just head across the street to Sprouts and get a much bigger and better sandwhich for the same price without the blue hairs.

Awesome lunch special.  8" poor boy (hot or cold) bag of chips and a drink for 5 bucks.  The bread is very fresh, staff always friendly, fast service and very dependable for a good sandwich.  Kind of a hole in the wall in not the greatest shopping center in Mesa, but a very pleasant sub shop I look forward to visiting at least once a week.

I come here for the beer, not the food.  Not because I don't like the food, just because I would rather drink my calories here.  Excellent beer, great college bar, but don't feel out of place being 30+

I thought we were in the middle of a recession??  Obviously people still need their deep dish pizza regardless of whether they have money or not.  This place is so good I can see how you would go into debt to pay for your pie!  We got their early....about 5:00 on a Saturday.  Clearly not early enough.  The wait was still about 45 minutes.  Once seated, we ordered some appetizers and "thin" crust, which come out fairly quick.  The deep dish takes about 45 minutes, so be prepared..  It is worth the wait.  The crust is flakey and buttery fresh.  Sauce is excellent and toppings are abundant.  I haven't experienced all the best pizza places in PHX yet, but this has got to be in the top 10.

I am a self-proclaimed sandwich expert and I was so happy to find Dilly's.  Everything about it is perfect.  I've only been in once, but can't wait to go back to make my way through the menu.  If only it was closer to where I work, I would go all the time.

I finally made it to this place after hearing nothing but great reviews from others.  Now I can see why it is held in such high regard.  If you are a fan of Paradise Bakery, this place is better...hands down.  At first glance, it appears to be identical, but on closer look it wins in two important categories.  First, the vast menu blows away the Paradise selection of "like 3 items"  There are countless sandwhiches, salads, soups and deserts.  Second of all, the prices are incredible.  It is very affordable for the quality and quantity of food.  Finally, the food is excellent.   Not that I have a problem with Paradise, but given the choice, Wildflower wins every time..

Wasn't sure what to expect as far as a bagel shop in this neighborhood, but I was in the mood for a bagel and thought I would give it a try.  I was very pleasantly suprised.  Excellent bagels and cream cheese, dare I say on par with Chompies.

From your first step in the door, you are immediately impressed by the awesome display of wine from floor to ceiling.  We were seated in a nice leather booth with plenty of privacy and greeted by a friendly server.  At first, I wasn't really sure about the entire idea of small serving dining, or whatever you call it.  However, since budget wasn't really the issue on this particular evening, we were up for anything.  I decided on a bottle of Chilean wine, since it tastes almost as good as a California, but 1/2 the price.  It met every expectation.  We then were served a romaine salad with, of all things, a deep fried whole egg.  It was interesting, but not my favorite...although my wife thoroughly enjoyed it.  We then enjoyed an open california roll.  It was not a roll in the traditional sense, however it was fantastic.  I decided on a pork dish for my entree, which was incredible.  It had so much flavor in each bite, I'm not sure I've received so much pleasure from a dish of the "other white meat" before in my life.  Needless to say, it was a great evening in south chandler.  I seriously doubt there is another restraunt of this caliber in the area.

This review is based solely on the sandwich dept. in the deli.  I'm sure the rest of Sprouts is good, but I'm not really the grocery shopper of the household.  This is one of the best lunchtime deals around.  Similar to AJ's, order at the counter exactly how you want it.  Choice of bread, meat, cheese and toppings.  The best part about it is the price.  Get the combo with chips and a Hansons soda for appx $5.  The sandwiches are very good. Not quite on par with a great deli, but you can't beat the quality at this price.

Thanks to Yelp, I called ahead and got my name on the waiting list.  We arrived and it appeared to be at least a 1/2 hour wait.  I went up and checked in and we were seated within 1 minute.  Fantastic service from start to finish.  Great for the kids, including a balloon guy.  The manager even came over and said the appetizer was on the house since it was out first visit.  I had the ribs and my wife had a steak. A lot of food, very affordable prices and great service equals 4 stars.

Thanks to Yelp, this is the only way you would be lucky enough to find a place like this.  I saw all the reviews and knew I had to make a visit the next time we were down that way.  I was suprised to see just how in the middle of nowhere the deli really is!  However, once inside, you quickly forget you are in a non-descript strip mall.  The Club sandwich was incredible.  I can't wait to go back to try the array of other meals that sounded tempting.

Perfect place for b-day dinner with the family.  Happy hour out on the patio, margaritas, sushi roll's, won ton's, pad thai.  All very tasty, great prices, good service.  Overall, I think this is one of my favorite local restaurants.  Not a big fan of chains, however I don't really feel like it's in that category.

I am not a yogurt expert by any means, however I thought this place was pretty good.  First time visiting a self-serve yogurt shop, and definitely enjoyed having free reign on the multiple choice of toppings.  I went with the Red Velvet / Caramel swirl and capped it with crushed Butterfingers.  The kids however tried about 10 flavors and 15 toppings in a small cup. We look forward to going back, especially in the heat of the summer.

Maybe I'm just caught up in the moment, but on my neverending quest to find the best sub, I think I finally found it.  I can't believe it took me so long to try this place out, but I'm so glad I did.  I ordered the hot pastrami combo.  At first I thought it was a little pricey ($8.00) but that was before I took my first bite.  It only took one bite and I knew I was onto something special.  It all starts with the bread.  It was fresh, warm and very tasty.  The melted cheese, sauce, lettuce, onion and pastrami were incredible when all rolled into one bite.  Not much else to say except try it for yourself.

I hate to admit it, but I like 5 guys better than In-n-Out.  I'm a Cali native and grew up on In-n-Out and I wanted nothing more than to say that 5 guys sucked and didn't compare.  Even though it is way over priced, the burgers are awesome and the fries are dope.

A friend bought some tickets on groupon and invited us to join them for a night out.  We had no expectations about what to expect, but were just looking forward to a night out and a few drinks.  When we first entered, it was a little disappointing to see a very small room with a tiny stage and bar.  However, we quickly overheard someone mention the room next door.  It turned out the comedy club was in an adjoining room and we were basically in the holding area bar.  Promptly at showtime we were ushered into the main room and seated in the front row.  I was quickly impressed with the quality of the comedians and found myself laughing outloud often.  The waitress kept the beers coming and the comics delivered a very entertaining evening.  I will definitely come back !

There are few fine dining establishments within a 10 mile radius, so Blue 32 gets a 4 star rating for being best in class of anything nearby.  Great food, excellent service and good atmosphere all lend to a fun night out.

I concur with the previous post.  Coming from California, I am not used to a prompt, young, tech savy medical office.  I am more accumstomed to the old, long wait, out of date medical office.  Altough it took a little getting used to the same day, day prior appt. system, this is definitely the way to go.
