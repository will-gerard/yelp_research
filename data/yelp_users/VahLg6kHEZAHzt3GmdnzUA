Wrote a letter to the medical office about this company. Robyn needs some communication skills. She is just awful. Hope I caught her on a bad day and she isn't always that miserable. Poor woman, bless her heart.

I have both a girl and boy here on Team. Beautiful facility with kind, compassionate coaches. They really push my kids to be the best they can be!

Maya is such an amazing person. She has helped my family tremendously. My Mother In Law went through some severe medical issues and had to revamp her diet completely. Maya has helped make the transition easy on both mother and her children. THANK YOU!!!

My husband and I laughed hysterically on our date last night at House of Comedy! It is about time we have some entertainment up north! The only gripe I had was that my cheesecake was served frozen, and then microwaved. I didn't go for the cheesecake though and the comics definitely made up for it!
