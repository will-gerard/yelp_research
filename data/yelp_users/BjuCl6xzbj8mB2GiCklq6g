I like it!  The chicken pitas are tasty. I've only gone for lunch since I work downtown, but I always enjoy the food.  Try ordering the hummus too!  I just wish they stayed open late at night.

This place is truly unique, and deserves 5 stars.  I too am now obsessed with this place!  The atmosphere is like no other you will find in a Phoenix coffee bar, people will actually interact and talk with each other, read, study, work, talk, watch television. It reminds me of being in someone's cozy living room.  I absolutely recommend this place!!!

I am a fan.  I went in for an hour and a half massage and had a very relaxing expreience.  If you go, ask for Brandon he is the best.  The location is newer, very clean, and the workers are friendly as well.

This is the SLOWEST drive thru I have ever been to in my life. If you come here, be prepared to wait forever.

Two words:  SMELLY and DIRTY!  Do not, I repeat, do not go to Jobot if you are hoping for a good environment, clean areas, or a decent crowd.  Is everyone doing these reviews blind??!  I am so disappointed too because I kept hearing about Jobot from multiple people, so I really wanted to check it out and see what it was like.  The cup of iced coffee I had was good, but that is the only positive comment I can make.  The customer service was so-so, the crowd there seemed sketchy and I just generally did not feel welcome or comfortable here.  I will not be back.

I am a fan of Glendale Sports Massage.  I stopped by one day because I was randomly driving by, and made an appointment with Eagle for the next week.  It was great!  My chronic back pain and knots in my muscles were relieved, and I felt like a new person by the time I left.  The facility is very new and very clean and organized.  I would recommend this place to my friends.
