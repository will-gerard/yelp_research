Don't come for the food. Just come for the atmosphere and drinks  Large indoor and outdoor spaces on a Friday night. Everyone in here was dressed like they were going out to a club in Vegas   Cool drink menu. Pimms cup was yummy but was mostly ice. My friend had the espresso martini she said was powerful and yummy  My friend ordered the smoked salmon platter. It came with lots of stuff but looked pretty boring  I ordered the galette. It was literally Lavash bread toasted to a cracker state topped with a little bacon, carmelized onion and light sprinkle of pre grated cheese and excessive amount of black olives. I ate it cuz I was hungry but it tasted like something I could throw together at home from leftovers around the house. It came with random slices of unripe tomato as garnish.   If you want this galette to taste better chefs: you should brush it with some garlic flavored olive oils, get rid of the olives, add a bit more cheese that you grate yourself and sprinkle chives. Or better yet, make your own flat bread dough

Fresh pasta dishes and the appetizers were yum(steak skewers and truffle laced kettle chips with blue cheese(get these), calamari was good but kinda salty), prices were fair for the atmosphere, cheaper than nearby restos like hakkasan, craftsteak, emerils, michealmina or Joel robechon's joints

ambiance: beautiful moorish archways inside, gorgeous al fresco dining, they had a guitarist there who was great, on saturdays they have flamenco performances (i was there on a sunday) service: ok, they had a lot of new servers, they are dressed like they are about to run with the bulls! I gave them 2 stars for ambiance  If you like their food, then you don't know what authentic yummy tapas are supposed to taste like  but when i go out to eat tapas, I expect something better than my home cooking. I knew after I looked at their extensive menu that they food would be so-so, reheated, or something like that. How could restaurant have all those choices, with foods that require lengthy preparation, and the restaurant was only 1/4 full on a sunday.  Highlights: free bread: pan de sal, rolls served with garlic sauce (or what they call aioli). they garlic sauce was yum....but when the dishes started to come out...i was disappointed...they all had the same garlic aoili  I typically order the following tapas at each tapas restaurant I try out to see how each one compares to each other, i've toured spain and ate a tons of tapas places so I know how it should taste:  1) Tortilla espanola 2) Patatas Bravas 3) Pan tomate  4) Paella Valenciana 5) Red Sangria 6) Croquettas (if they are on the menu, very few restaurants serve these) 7) Sepia(cuttlefish)/Calamares (squid)/ or Pulpo (octopus) a la Plancha  I didn't end up ordering the pan tomate or the tortilla espanola this time. They didn't have a "---" a la plancha on the menu either.. Duh, becuase in order to serve seafood a la plancha it has to be fresh and everything here tasted reheated.  We ordered:  1) patatas bravas: tasted/looked like KFC potato wedges with La Tapatia sauce.  Don't get me wrong, they still tasted decent but they were not authentic 2) fried artichoke with aoili: luke warm brined artichoke with beer batter  lying in a puddle of the garlic aoili suace (yes, the same one that was served with bread) 3) escargot: basically your average canned escargot in garlic/parsley sauce with drizzles of garlic aoili suace (yes, the same one served with the bread), this tasted good, but when does escargot in garlic butter not tasted good? 4) Paella Valenciana: they did not use paella rice, they had too much green bell pepper saute on it, the chorizo? i thought it was cut up vienna sausage at first, but it was chorizo, just in miniature form, they should have just minced it, the rice was more like a stew because there was tons of broth left in the pan, so no burnt soccarrat at the bottom to enjoy, you could tell the rice was blanced earlier and then tossed together with the ingredients in a pot then placed in the paella pan for service...don't bother ordering this if you like paella...it will just piss you off..and where was the saffron essence? 5) ham & cheese croquettas: 3 luke warm croquettas lying in a puddle of the garlic aoili suaces, again: they inside should melt out of the crispy breading, but because it wasnt' hot enough or because the filling was made with too much flour, it didn't  Definitely DO NOT ORDER:  Sauteed mushrooms: it only took them 3 min to bring it out after we ordered them, they were soooo grey and nasty.  I couldn't eat another bite! they were only warmed through...ugh yuck!  Stuffed squid braised with squid ink: i've had a version of this tapa several times so I know this stuff had to be good. Wrong.  The squid stuffing was luke warm in the middle. The ink sauce was missing something, it was heavily diluted with the flavor of chicken bouillion cube broth.

Craving one of their pops now! Tried the coconut, guava, and calamansi flavors. Soooo gooood! Brings back memories of eating fresh fruit paletas in the Mission of SF that no longer exist.  Do u guys ship?  Really! I'd order some right now! or can you do a special deal for me and ship some so I don't have to go to fly out to LV to go to LV outlets or LV whole foods to buy some

Come here if you've never had fry bread before and you will leave satisfied!   Huge portions with decent pricing. They also customize your toppings(chipotle style) so if you want more salsa or jalape√±os and cheese, that's your opportunity. They have a few tables indoors and outdoors   Indian taco is the way to go because the fry bread is already folded for you and easier to eat
