I was thrilled to see a Cracker Barrel on my way from San Diego to Phoenix!  I usually only get to eat there when I visit Florida.  Our server, Angela, was very accommodating.  I was on a very restrictive diet and she helped me pick what to eat.  The restaurant itself is very accommodating.  While we were eating, the manager unlocked and opened the back door so an elderly blind gentleman could more easily enter the restaurant.  The steak I had was surprisingly flavorful considering I asked them to cook it plain with no seasoning or butter (damned diet!)  I only wish it weren't so far from home.

I normally really like El Pollo Loco for their grilled chicken thighs and sometimes I get a salad as well.  Even though the place only had 3 customers inside at 11:30am on a Sunday, I passed up 3 dirty tables before settling on one near the back door.  Um docking a star because of that.  Our food came out quickly which was good, but the chicken was too spicy and so was the medium salsa.  Its OK to have a local flavor for a local restaurant but chains should be consistent in their recipes.

Lotus was a super waitress!  She didn't even write the order down and got our order perfect-- with six of us.  My mahi mahi tacos were excellent but I had to eat them with a fork because they were so stuffed full of food!  My husband had the meatloaf and it was the best I ever tasted.  Five stars!

I was so thrilled to see a Bealls On my way home from Phoenix!  Usually I have to travel to Florida for one of these!  I tried on 12 pieces and unfortunately most were so poorly made that they looked misshaped on me.    I REALLY wanted to like this store but because the quality was so poor I just cannot recommend it even though I wound up buying a few pieces.
