Became a country music fan when I walked through the door.  Furthermore, as a woman alone, it's the only bar I'll go to by myself.    I love everything about it, let me count the ways:  1.  Mesquite wood firepits and heaters warm you in the large outdoor section in winter (while you gaze at the stars or into someone's eyes.)  2.  Misters keep you cool in summer.  3.  You can sit at the bar outside, but still see and hear the live band and be part of the action.  4.  It's always crowded but not too crowded.  5.  Guys are always asking you to dance.  6.  Everyone is nice and smiles and talks to you.  7.  The lighting and sound is just right throughout.  8.  Plenty of tasty food choices to accompany the drinks (I like the chicken tenders with homemade ranch dressing but I'm a simple girl.)  9.  The music is outstanding.  From the world-class musical artists to the family atmosphere--five stars.  The Herndon family rocks.  (NOTE:  Ask around about how many famous people show up here to sing, play, have dinner or just hang out.)

The absolute WORST greedy monopoly you could imagine. They have been ruining my credit for SEVEN years -- over $36.19 -- completely unbeknownst to me. Here it is March of 2016, and they just sent it to another collection agency. I found out when purchasing a car yesterday. This bill was MY EX-HUSBAND'S--who switched it into my name right before he moved out. The forwarding address was HIS address, not mine. But I am the one who is suffering. A HORRIBLE company, a member of ALEC, writing laws for Republicans who pass them on behalf of all the Oil Welfare Kings who are members of this secret cartel. Also big-time FRACKERS, polluting the nation's water supplies. If I could give negative stars, I would. Southwest Gas SUCKs.

Liars. I waited for 45 minutes with my son last night at the store at Tatum and Shea, to be told that they were out of stock on the $99 Razr cell phone. They called this store at Frank Lloyd Wright and Scottsdale Rd - manager Travis - to hold the phone for us. First thing when this store opened at 10 am we were there - my excited little son by my side. I verified that the phone was $99. "Oh yes." Then they started ringing us up. The phone was $199, not $99. They wouldn't honor the $99 - it had "gone off special" a "couple of weeks ago." Travis the "manager" did NOTHING but jeer at me. They told me I could use my phone's $50 upgrade credit toward the phone. I continued to ring out - they then charged me ANOTHER THIRTY DOLLARS for upgrading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "Their new policy." I would have WALKED OUT except I didn't want to disappoint my son, since this was a gift he had been waiting all summer for. VERIZON ABSOLUTELY SUCKS and so do their non-union employees! No wonder their profits are so high - they are liars and rip off artists.

OMG - I don't even like beer that much, but I LOVE this beer.  And the food is to live for!  SIX stars, at least.  Don't wait, GO!  And they're planning an expansion.

HORRIBLE place.  I just received a TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL for simple blood test that was supposed to be part of my free-yearly-covered-by-insurance check up last December.  They have "outsourced all their billing" and "my issue is with LabCorp" - their lab that THEY USE.  I DIDN'T ORDER ANYTHING FROM LABCORP.   Avoid this doctor at all costs.
