I'm not rating the food , as my wife and I didn't stick around long enough to try it.  Now, where to begin... We entered the establishment only to find the lobby deserted.  We stood there for a couple of minutes, then I started down the hallway to where the hostess was having what must have been a very important conversation with another employee.  Body language says a lot and it was clear that I was interrupting her.  She told us it would be 10 minutes, at 3:30, on a Sunday.   After a few minutes they led us to a half-table / half-booth.  I took the booth side.  While I was sitting, I noticed all of the crumbs, crayons, and crap along the edge of the cushion.  Once seated, my rear-end noticed how worn out the booth truly was.  I commented to my wife, who told me that her chair felt like it was going to fall apart.   Then we both noticed the sticky table, and the fact that it wobbled with little provocation.   I understand that things wear out.  I also understand that, when your business is in the restaurant industry, you must deal with that wear and tear, not just ignore it.   Since it was impossible not to wonder about the condition of the kitchen, given the condition of what we could see (and feel), we were out the door before they could serve us chips and salsa.

We come for breakfast almost every Sunday.  They're always busy, but they always treat us like family.  Fresh, hot and consistently good.

Crying shame, it is, when a place that I've been touting to family and friends for as long as I can remember falls off a cliff.  While they still have a fantastic selection of craft brews, customer service has clearly, and RAPIDLY, fallen to the bottom of their list.   Twice in two weeks my wife and I have stopped in, hoping/expecting to get served in a professional manner, only to find ourselves compelled to leave, extremely disappointed.   Last week, while staring at several open tables, we were told that, "it will be 20-30 minutes while our servers catch up."  Then, just now, we tried again.  We got seated right away.  After waiting patiently for 10 minutes, I verbally snagged a server who was doing his level best to ignore us and told him I sure would appreciate it if our server would maybe stop by.   Some dude comes to our table and makes it clear that he's doing us a favor by filling in because they are, "so busy."  We left.  He made it abundantly clear that he could give a shit.  Seems unlikely we'll be back anytime soon.   Sucks!  I used to like this place.  Too bad their management clearly has their head squarely up their ass.

We found ourselves far from home, in an unfamiliar part of town, and hungry for breakfast.  Yelp recommended this place.  Good call, Yelp!  Fast, friendly service.  Good menu variety.  In-house bakery.  Cage-free eggs.  Gluten-free choices.  And fresh-squeezed OJ...with a free refill!!  Give OBH a try!

Not a good experience. First of all, we had a choice between sitting inside with live music that was ridiculously loud or sitting outside on the patio with no fans or misting system in Arizona. Secondly, their vegetarian menu items are limited to a cheese pizza (which appeared to of come out of a box), or a pretzel. Next, my Reuben sandwich had approximately half a teaspoon of Russian dressing and absolutely no sauerkraut. When I asked the waitress about this, she checked with the kitchen who informed her that they didn't have any sauerkraut, but they sent it out without it anyway. Not a good decision. While the beer flight was good, my wife's iced tea had all indications of having come out of some sort of mix. The final straw was when the lady at the table behind us lit up her cigarette. I challenged the waitress as to whether smoking was allowed and she said it was, despite being in clear violation of Arizona state law. The bottom line? While I may return for the beer, my wife most likely won't be back anytime soon.
