This company has been quite a nightmare to work with. Let's start with they allow you to skip your next delivery as long as it's made by 3pm the day before. Well I clicked to skip at 2 shortly after I got their voicemail and it said I had to do it within 2 days. Then I checked the invoice and I typically pay the balance when I get their delivery phone call, and I noticed that I've been charged for an extra month. I tried calling both of their 1-800 numbers and the phone number(s) gave me a busy signal. Which also is a problem because we moved and now they're going to deliver to the old address, and unlike every other company who owns a website they won't let you update your delivery address online, but they'll gladly take my credit card information. I'd say this company is a joke, but I'm not laughing.

This place is awesome!!! Amazing coffee and probably the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had, and that includes grandma's. The owners are amazing, and the staff on top of it! Can't wait to return!!!
