Our waitress was nice. But everything else wasn't. Food took forever to come out. Ask for  water in a kids cup, took them 15min or so. It was Thursday nooning, hardly anyone there.. I like Johnny rockets but not coming back to this one :(

Gone here couple times before and always like their garden eggs benedict. But this time I decided to change it up a bit and order their chorizo eggs benedict. It wasnt what I expected. Burnt, no pinto de gallo, pototoes was cold. Wasn't happy. My fiance got the corn beef hash, thumbs down. had to ask them to remake it. it was burnt yet soggy in the inside. overall not happy. used to be good. idk what happened. the cook probably had a rough morning. lol

Omg, Been wanting to go here 4-5 months ago. anways, came here on a Saturday night. they seated us right away. didnt really pay attention to the table till our food came out. NO utensils & NO napkins. hadda ask them a coupon of times. Finally when fiance finish cooking Galbi & Bulgogi. OMG the galbi smell, taste like vinegar. the waitress bought out a new one, yet it still smell.    Customer service SUCKS!! when u pass our table atleast ask us hows our food taste since you guys been messing up with our orders. NOPE not even once. just stands there looking around. Worst ever.

Horrible service.  Only two people working. The only time the lady smile was when she receive the bill. Party of 9, and everyone wasnt satisfied. First and LAST time everrrr.

My new favorite spot. The employee is really nice and friendly. This was the first salon I seen using liners for the spa on each clients. It's really classy and the atmosphere was comfortable. Everyone made me feel like I belong there. Beside all the construction going on. (new manager) It's a place to be!! I'm coming here more often!  They accept credit card, but bring cash for tips :)
