I am saddened to see the low star reviews of this place. This restaurant has been a staple of Phoenix for so many years and has always offered a piece of Arizona History along with a great meal.  My history started with the Old Spagethii Factory many years ago...when my parents decided that this would be my "thing" To do on my birthday. I am so glad that this year marks my 40th birthday celebration at the Factory and I would not give up the history for the world.  The food is always about what it is. My thousand island salad dressing is the favorite over anywhere else and I am pretty simple in my selection of food - rich meat with (1) meatball. Of course it all has to be started off with some awesome cheesy bread!   If you ever have the time to walk in an just inspect the place, you will find all kinds of cool antiques and articles from years past. It's a virtual experience in treasure hunting.  But before you leave, also take the opportunity to ring the bell on the trolley, because you won't find many trolley cars you can eat in!!  Be kind to the businesses that make Phoenix a better place and know that if they didn't live up to a 5 star review, it is the exception and not the rule!

A Blast from the past! We had an office just down the street and found this place to be great for eating in and taking out. A friendly staff is attentive and the food is pretty good. The stuff that litters the walls gives the restaurant character and a unique charm.  Oh yeah! And the soda fountain drinks are out of is world!

Ok, so for those of you who know me you know I don't frequent bars (of any kind) rarely drink and pretty much stay to myself. Found out Dwight Knox is the new owner here and last night we were talking about the FREE breakfast he serves Everyday. I was helping my sister out this morning and decided to stop by. Holy cow! This is amazingly good. All the games on clear TV and yes and the place was jumping! Doing a good thing Dwight! Keep up the good work.  Former Moon Valley and Apollo Alum are the owners!

I have only ventured to this restaurant on two occasions...the first was on suggestion from Pastor Paul Wilson and then tonight when Kristi and I were checking out places to eat.  Caramba's menu is very simple, but offers a wide selection.  I chose a combination with a taco, tostado and tamale. When the food came out, it covered two plates. Needless to say, even with my heavy appetite, I struggled to everything.  Kristi ordered a beef chimi...nothing special, but very filling as well. The big compliment came at the temperature of the food that came out. Everything was hot, and definitely was prepared fresh.  This is a great place to stop in for a quick bite or bring in the family for a meal.  Kristi and I spent like $20 and left full.  The one thing that was a little weird...the charge for drink refills.

I'm not going to lie...I miss high school.  Moon Valley was a place I spent the majority of my childhood.  As the son of a teacher, my adventure with Mooon Valley started in 1980 and continued until my departure in 1993.  When you go back through your memories, you have a tendency to glorify several of the things that happened in your life, but high school...wee, it is something that just happens!  Coming in as a freshman, the whole expienece is a bit overwhelming. You see the world from the bottom and know that you will have to wait your turn to be at the top of the ladder.  Moon Valley was a prideful school, with a history of success and a case full of trophies. A school that excelled in athletics and academics.  Over the years, the school has spiraled downward and just driving by makes me just shake my head.   Class of 1993... To all my classmates and the year of the first state track and field championships, I am honored to have spent some of the most memorable times of our lives.

I had my first haircut here many years ago. My Dad started getting his haircut here when he was 10.  There are few places where you can get the kind of service that reminds you of a different time and place in our society.  Danny is one of those people who is more like extended family than a Barber. He has been there throughout the ups and downs in life, listening and offering advice and his own life experiences on things.  This is a place where memories are made, friendships are formed, and traditions are past down from generation to the next.  If you stop in, ask Danny about his Halloween scare story and you'll be sure to have a good laugh- while establishing your own memories!

We use this for a post office location for our business.  The afte hours access helps us with our schedules and the employees see us coming so if are there during normal hours, we don't have to fumble with getting our box open.  We also use the location to receive packages and appreciate the email notifications when packages arrive.  The owner is very involved and is friendly and helpful. His involvement is evident in the way his employees act.

This was the first time I have been here since the name change from Bobby McGee's.    First appearance, it seems like the old place, with changes of course. The first thing that struck me was that all the Super Heroes were gone....those were the days when you could come in an have Batman (or if your lucky,...WONDER WOMAN) serving your food.  But like all things, we have to grow up.  Ever since El Paso BBQ closed down on 43rd and Peoria, I have been looking for good BBQ. Well, lo and behold...at Bobby Q's, I FOUND IT!  Start off with the Q rolls (which is a beef brisket rolled in a tortilla and then deep fried) and go right into your 2 or three meat platter. OH YEAR! The brisket is great, the pork is pulled perfectly, and all the meats are tender, juicy and flavorful!  Kristi indulged in a traditional chicken fried chicken and I will be darned if it was not the best I have had in Arizona!   I had to force down the macaroni and cheese, which was also cheesy and flavorful, but I managed,  As we were leaving at 9:45 PM on a Saturday, the lines were already opening up for the party scene on the bar side....so it shows that even though its no longer the Bobby McGees I grew up with, it hasn't lost its lister for the night life!  Highly recommended!

I'll give this a 4 star rating.  People need to learn to have an expectation and what you should expect is that there are tons of kids running around (after all, this place is pretty much an attraction for kids!) and you can expect that by the end of the day, it won't be perfect.  We have done birthdays here before and the party room experience blows...it's all rush, rush, rush.  Today, we jus had our daughters 5 birthday and, knowing the issues we have had in the past, we planned around it.  Instead of getting a party room, we got there right when the place opened (10:00 am). We chose a spot  in one of the rooms and and set up camp. We had about 15 people with us, so we did take up a bit of room.  With the buffet and the "all day" pass (which really only lasts 3 hours), it cost about 15 bucks a person.  Being there early, we learned the place starts getting slammed around noon, we had a great time. The lines were not too long, the food was coming out pretty fresh and hot, and the kids were having a good time. The staff is always friendly and they do their best.  We hung out until about 2 and got out of the before it got too crazy.   If you expect great food, your gong to be disappointed. It's a quantity over quality thing with this place. Food will not be super great, bu kids will be happy...and I always eat enough to be full.

Went here on mothers day with a party of 10. We called ahead to try and get a reservation and they would not accept....a little odd, but we showed up anyway. We were seated promptly and immediately offered drinks. The waitress, Jenny, seemed to be attentive and didn't let our drinks go. I drink A LOT of iced tea and measure my service by how long my glass sits empty, how much ice, etc. So, in this regards, huge points with me.  The food also came out promptly and was well made. Clam chowder was GREAT and steaks were really good.  Overall, we had a great experience, but it was weird that we were not offered any dessert....  Kids portions are huge (too much) and the adult sized portions were more than enough.

I hate writing poor reviews, I really do, and I take the time to resolve the issues FULLY before I take the time to write a negative review. I think 12 months is long enough of a wait...so here I am.  I purchased a 50/10 internet. Since I had this installed, there has never been a time when I have been above 15/5. That's pretty shoddy advertisement and then delivery on service.   Bottom line - Customer Support has been rude. Techs have missed multiple appointments and my service still sucks.   Stay away from COX.

I hate doing anything here...hate it. No desire to use this branch outside of last resort. Slow, incompetent, and understaffed all the time.

One of the best Philly Cheesteaks I have had!  Great little restaurant where the owners are super friendly, the staff I pleasant and helpful, and the food matches the quality you would expect.  We stopped in on a Sunday evening, not wanting to have to wait to eat. They were happy to help and offered some sugestions as we were just kinda "blah" about eating.  We ordered the sampler appetizers, a small cheese pizza for the kids, some bone in and boneless wings, the philly Cheesteaks and a ham and provolone sub.   We took a menu and a magnet on the way out and will be visiting again!

I enjoy this place.  "Whoz better than you!"   The food is not five star but not 0 star either. You pay a reasonable price for good food. The portions are enough to leave you full and you enjoy the place as a whole.   The owner of this location is friendly and fun. He has this thick accent and  is always willing to make suggestions.  He is a no bones kind of guy and will always tell it like it is.  If your looking for an alternative to fast food and like to whet your appetite on some Italian, it's a great place!

Great Concept!  My girls love this place. You have to really learn the schedule when the place is really busy (because it gets packed) and that is when the experience is diminished and the potential for getting hurt is heightened.  The big plus is the multitude of things to do. For the smaller,. younger children, they have their own set of trampolines and the bounce houses..well, who doesn't love a good bouncy bounce!  The older kids can experience the main attraction and I will tell you that watching some of the stunts is pretty amazing! Not to mention the dodge ball, foam pit and the maze...2 hours gets eaten up pretty quick.  Whats great about this is that kids are being ACTIVE and really getting a work out. I was out for like 10 minutes and my butt was kicked...so this is a great way to get your kids moving and motivated.  The staff is young, but so is the staff at hot dog on stick...but they keep things pretty well under control and I have only seen one person get hurt in all the times that we have been there. Looking for common sense, good customer service, or a straight answer and you might have better luck talking with the floor.  Worth the money...great value...and fun. A definite two thumbs up in my book.

Only a few words that can describe the experience that this restaurant has to offer: different, AMAZING, and great!    Third Place is not your typical restaurant and has been founded on a principal that everyone has Three places in their lives: home, work, and a comfortable place to hang out. Third Place offers a unique dining experience for the entire famly.  The food is traditionally American with a slight twist. The restaurant has only been open for a couple of weeks and we have already visited for two dinners and a Saturday lunch. With each visit, we have experienced different options from the menu. So far, we have had the Amazingly Embarassing Hot Dog (you'll have to see it for yourself to understand), to the grilled cheese with a sweet tomato bisque for dipping, to the 3rd Place burger, and my all time favorite- brisket tacos!  A little story behind the tacos is that this item is on the menu at my request! If you want to know the whole story, I suggest visiting yourself and ask for the Ugly Pool Guy Brisket Tacos and then ask for one of the owners to explain why you are ordering them like that! :)  My review of this restaurant will be something that will be developed over man posts and will include some of the more interesting facts of the restaurant as Well as my reviews of the different dishes tha are eaten with each visit!  A must for your family and be sure to take a look at the unique ways you will be supporting the community with each of the items you order!

Fun place, great food, better atmosphere!  We were recommended here by a teacher at the girls school (apparently the sister owns it) so we checked it out after church one night. The restaurant is an order and seat yourself kind of place. The price is very reasonable, about 34.00 for a famil of 4. The food was perfectly cooked and everything was fresh and of quality ingredients. The place was packed the entire time we were there and you could tell that it was just a great place to be. Highly recommended!  Btw: the just got their beer and wine license!

It's a prime example of a poorly run government agency. Never understand why the expectation of service has to be so low! My solution, privatize the whole thing, make it for profit and watch customer service improve!

I am a proponent of good skin and nails. As a contractor that wears flip-flops on a regular basis, my feet become less than friendly.   As a man, I wouldn't want rough feet and hands touching me, so I cannot imagine me touching someone feeling like that!  My first MANi-pedi (Noticed I capitalized MAN!) came many years ago and I was hooked!  When I found this salon, I was immediately impressed. It is one of the cleanest and friendliest places I have been in many years. The team that works there is very attentive and always ensures your satisfaction.   TIP: If you ask for a Margarita, you will be served a Vodka Margarita right at your chair! Much different flavor than a traditional tequila margarita and just a nice way to relax.  If you go into the shop, ask for the Ugly Pool Guy Special! You will get my entire treatment!

This is the greatest place!! If you are looking for a FAMILY OWNED AND OPERATED bakery/deli...well here it is!   Probably the most quaint location in the heart of downtown Glendale. Chef Tom is right there to make taste bud delights come to life!!  Come by during the summer and you lift find their Son, Duncan, delivering refreshing lemonade to sun beaten warriors of the concrete jungle!  And did I mention that Adriene Oftedahl Sanders is a Moon Valley Rockets Alum? So you have a local hometown family making it happen!  We stopped by to grab a sandwich and say "Hi!"  Show some love to your small business owners and get some great food in the process!
