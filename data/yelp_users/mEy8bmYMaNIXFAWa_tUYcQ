I decided to go to My Wine Cellar to finish some homework and it was a great experience. I brought my laptop and the staff was more than accommodating. Ann, the bartender for the night, was very friendly.   Overall a great experience!

What a rip off! I am a very understanding person since I've been involved in business relations for a long part of my life. I cancelled my membership 3 months ago, my credit card got stolen and during the time that it took to replace it and change it to a new one, Gold's Gym tried to charge it. Since they were unable to, they felt that they needed to extend my membership again and void the cancelation. I just had to pay for a declined charge, 2 additional months, AND had to deal with a very rude representative. Not to mention that their facilities are in decline. CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED!!

Thievery at its worst! My co-worker Carly was led to believe by Garrett Bias, a manager at this location, that she needed to get a voucher from her employer to get a discount (a complete lie because I never needed a voucher) and then proceeded to give her the run around about refunding her money.   I am not exaggerating when I say that this Garrett guy called one of my friends a bitch, called his corporate office to tell them a whole different story of what happened to cover his rude ass (he called a very rude and unprofessional lady called Kaitlyn ID#1912043) and is still not willing to accept that he conned her out of her money and lied to her face about her contact.   Be warned!

Thievery at its best. The basement of standards out of any airline I've ever used. Not only do the seats are horrible and compacted even more than a normal coach seat, but their customer service was rude and simply unprofessional when I attempted to contact their hotline. My advice? Pay extra for a ticket in a humane airline. After all, the price will be almost the same after you pay for bags and every thing they'll charge you for.
