They pharmacy employees were very rude towards me didn't take time to explain there policy nor did they give me a chance to explain their pharmacy manager waved a stupidly hand gesture I was basically treated very bad and it was done in front of customers I will go to your corporate office until I get answers I will never come back to any Walgreens the employees in the pharmacy are very rude and need help on customer service I will contact your corporate office

Found this restaurant on yelp when we got there we wasn't greeted I ask to be seated at the shushi bar the place was practically empty it took a while for a waitress to serve us i ordered a drink when I got the drink it barely had alcohol in it when we ordered the food was very good at the end of the dinner we noticed roaches on the wall saw one then more came out I told the waitress she didn't do anything about it I was grossed out i won't be eating here again

Went to the glass house the customer service I'll rate it at a 10 plus I love dive bars especially when there's one with in walking distance from my place I've heard a lot of bad stories from your bar I'm glad you guys either clean house or changed employees attitude or whatever you did now I have a bar to go to and the food was very good I own my company since 1985 it took hard work and dedication now company huge were all over the United States with 100 plus employees and we practice every day Customer Service good luck to you guys for having a bar that will be a huge success
