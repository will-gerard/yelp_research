Aris Physical Therapy is as professional and efficient as it gets. At age 71 I have a diagnosis of advanced arthritis in my left hip. My doctor told me that the only reason that I have good pain management and not overdue for a hip replacement is because I have done serious resistance training in the gym for the past 14 years. The muscles and tendons around the hip joint are strong. Al and his team at Aris are working with me to increase range of motion and fine tune my lifting techniques to keep keep things strong to avoid surgery in the future. The sessions are 90 minutes and they are teaching me stretching and additional exercises that will help keep me pain free without drugs or surgery. Al is an athlete himself, knows his way around a gym and understands the exercises that I do and have available in the gym.

The Shepherd's Pie listed on the Irish Faire section of the menu was mediocre, at best. It was soupy and greasy. It was basically ground beef soup. The vegetables were almost nonexistent. There were only a couple of bits of carrot. Peas, a customary ingredient, were missing. For $14.99, I expected a large serving and expected to take some home. The serving was less than generous. For a place that claims to be Irish, they need someone to show them how to prepare Shepherd's Pie. The Sam Adams Octoberfest was good.
