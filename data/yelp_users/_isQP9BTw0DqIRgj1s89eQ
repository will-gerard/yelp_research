I seriously love this place. Great sushi without breaking the bank and the ability to try multiple types of rolls without having to commit to a full roll you may not like.

Not impressed. Most expensive meal that I didn't care for. The wedge salad dressing tasted weird and was not great and I don't know what kind of soup that was but it wasn't clam chowder as they claimed. Fifty dollars later and I should have gone to Chipotle. I do not recommend.

Omg I could live on the croissants!!!! I'd be 500 pounds but man they are so good it might be worth it!!! Food was really good! I like the sides and the prices didn't bust the budget. Staff was super friendly and attentive! Didn't have to wait to get a table on a Friday night at 8pm. Definitely coming back!

Food was good and the service was as well. Happy to finally have a decent sit down Mexican food place in town!

Went here shortly after they opened to get donuts for my team at work. Several varieties were available and they were making them fresh! I got some that were still warm. The team gave them two thumbs up saying they were even better than Bosas. This is now the donut shop of choice when they want me to pick some up. The fritters were a-mazing!
