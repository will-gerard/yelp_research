I stopped in on my way home. I found the staff to be very pleasant. The lady, Thi, that did my pedicure, was very friendly and polished them up in a patriotic theme for July 4th. The shop is small, and they were really pushing "the extras," but I thought it was a pleasant enough place. And my pedicure looks great!

I have lived in Phoenix most of my life, but didn't try this place until a couple of months ago. What was I thinking?!? This place is awesome! I was a little concerned about the "fusion" of Asian and Mexican food, but I shouldn't have been. The food is delicious. They even let you try samples at the counter! My favorite is the red jade chicken, but really...IT'S ALL GOOD! And, they bring you a tasty little Snickerdoodle cookie with your meal, which makes the whole visit worthwhile. I would give it five stars, but the only drawback is the place looks really dirty. If you can get past that, however, you are in for a treat. Try it. You'll like it.

Being that my office is near this restaurant, I have probably been here about 20 times in the last three years. The staff are always accommodating and friendly. The assortment on the menu is excellent, and everything I've ever ordered there has met or exceeded my expectations. The ambience is quite inviting, but it is not a place for young children. One of my favorite things on the menu is a turkey dip sandwich that comes with a side of mushroom gravy. It is delicious! In addition, their couscous cannot be beat. My favorite dessert...when I allow myself to have one!... Is the white chocolate bread pudding. It is simply a slice of heaven! If you're looking for a great place to meet somebody for lunch or a romantic dinner, this is the place. Some of the menu items can be a little pricey, but their food is the best. As I said, I have been here several times throughout the past few years and I've never had one problem with my order. This is one of my favorite places restaurants in the Valley! Try it...you'll love it!

I often meet friends here because it is centrally located for us. I have been to this restaurant many times and am never disappointed. They provide an extensive menu for a variety of appetites. And while I'm not a big drinker, their cocktails and beers have been warmly received by my dining companions. I've also found each waiter I've met to be pleasant, friendly and attentive to our needs. The only complaint is that it gets very noisy and on weekend nights the parking can be a bit challenging. All in all, I like this place, and enjoy meeting up with friends there because the atmosphere, food and folks are great.

I live close to this Harkins theater, and it is usually where I go see movies. The staff are very friendly and accommodating, and the theaters are always clean. I can always count on getting into see the latest movie, provided that I get there at least 15 minutes early. For a movie theater, I I find that this one is quite immaculate, given that most theaters have popcorn strewn across the floor and in the seats. This is a great theater and I am fortunate that it's almost in my backyard. One more thing. I'm quite impressed with the loyalty cup and T-shirt program that Harkins offers. I attended a breakfast where Dan Harkins spoke and said that he pioneered this loyalty program in the movie theater business. I applaud this, as it has saved my family at least $100 or so in one year during our trips to the movies. Keep up the great work, Harkins!

From where I live in Phoenix, there are three Fry's that are about the same distance to my house. Today, I went to the Fry's at 19th Avenue and Union Hills and I was very disappointed. I know it's hot in Phoenix right now and being out in the sun is torture...but I don't know which is worse...people who REFUSE to return their shopping carts back to the cart corral, or the fact that the employees responsible for gathering them up aren't doing their jobs. When I drove in, the lot was full of shopping carts. I had to maneuver my car in between three just to park. And while I'm on that subject, the parking lot is filthy. There are bits of trash (I even stepped over a busted license plate holder) scattered everywhere, and the entrance into the store is a mess. On this particular day, they were also restocking shelves (at noon on a Sunday?) so the aisles were not only packed with customers but only employees wheeling gigantic carts. The store itself is also in disarray, and the grocery items were sometimes hard to find or they were out of what I needed. After I loaded my groceries into my car, (I actually returned MY cart to the now overflowing cart corral) I was backing out and swear I saw a drug deal go down as a man approached a car and something was exchanged. On top of that, they have some strange characters trolling this parking lot. I just didn't feel safe, appreciated or acknowledged at this store. It's a dump...and the store management doesn't seem to take any pride in improving the customer experience. Oh, well. I guess I have two Fry's stores to choose from now. Great prices, but not worth the frustration.

We have been to Scramble a few times for breakfast and it never disappoints. The food is fresh, the prices are decent and the place is very clean. We've had the French French toast (delightful)...chocolate chip pancakes (heavenly)...bacon (perfect balance of flavor and crispness)...and the best part of all...freshly squeezed orange juice. The juice seems to be a favorite, as most patrons grab one from the cooler on the way to ordering. If you want to mix up your breakfast routine and try something new, I suggest you try Scramble. Everything is simply delicious and a treat for your tastebuds.

While I cannot rate the hotel rooms, I will tell you that the Easter brunch there was THE WORST I've ever had.   We arrived around 1:00pm per our reservation, and we had to wait 10 minutes before we were seated. They took us into a back meeting room, where tables were so close together you could reach out and touch the family next to you. And while the staff was pleasant, our waiter had so many tables and we had to flag him down each time we wanted a refill on our drinks.   At one point, he served us basically carbonated water when it was meant to be soda. It took him at least ten minutes to get us the "right soda" and it STILL tasted horrible so we just gave up.   Now, the food wasn't much better. There were only a few choices of meats (dry turkey, ham, stale sausage and bacon) and the mashed potatoes were overcooked as well as the eggs. The food was lukewarm, and had no taste. The salad bar was pathetic. They had one large bowl of lettuce, some dressing, and croutons. No additional dressings or other veggies. The bowl was pretty much empty the whole time, so the staff wasn't paying attention to it.   The dessert table was a joke. Most of the time there were only crumbs left with sad, pathetic drizzles of the remnants of chocolate syrup drizzled on the serving plates. Plus, the selection was marginal at best.   Overall, we were extremely disappointed in our visit. This was supposed to be my birthday treat from my parents, and it was a big letdown.   My recommendation is that if you live in north Phoenix and you're looking for a good brunch, DO NOT come here. They charged $20 per person ($100 for the five of us), yet I bet my family and I only ate $15 worth of food because it was so horrible. This was a MAJOR disappointment.   You know the buffet is bad when you have to stop at a fast food restaurant on the way home just to get a burger to fill you up.

I've been taking my dog, Tripp, to see Dr. Grossman ever since I adopted him three years ago. Dr. Grossman and his staff are the ultimate professionals, and they love to see Tripp! Dr. Grossman has treated Tripp for a variety of afflictions, such as allergies and Valley Fever, and he always knows what's best for my dog. I know that some people hesitate to take their pet to a veterinarian because it can be cost prohibitive. However, that's not the case with Dr. Grossman. I am charged fairly and never have to break the bank to pay my vet bill. What I appreciate most about Sonoran Hills Pet Clinic is that the staff always calls to check up on Tripp after a visit. It's that kind of interest and care they take in Tripp that keeps me coming back to Dr. Grossman. If you live in the north Valley and need a good vet, make an appointment with Dr. Grossman and see why he and his staff are the BEST!

There are many places in Phoenix to go to for so-so BBQ, but there aren't that many that are as memorable ... and delicious!... as Pork on a Fork. This place is inconspicuously tucked away from the road near Deer Valley airport, with a sign that says, "Valley's Best BBQ" and an arrow directing traffic. Well, that is an understatement! The first time my boyfriend and I stopped in, we were warmly greeted by the staff. We chose our entree and sides (he got the beef brisket and I got the chicken ... and we both got macaroni salad -yum!) and took our plates to the back, where it opens up to a clean, brightly-colored room. From there, we had an assortment of BBQ sauces to choose from. (My personal favorite is the Sweet and Mild.) Since then, we've been back several times and now go at least once a week. We're so appreciative that this little gem is near our house...it's not only the best BBQ in north Phoenix, but possibly the Southwest. The meat is smoked, juicy and absolutely mouth-watering. The price is right, and the employees are friendly and accommodating. If you like good BBQ...and not the mediocre kind served by most chains around town...try Pork on a Fork...you won't just like it...you will LOVE it!

The first time went to a show at StandUp Scottsdale was last Friday night to celebrate  my birthday. Let me just say that I was beyond delighted. Being that the club is only minutes from Swanky Scottsdale, I was a little surprised to see that the outside of the club looks a bit scary. However, once we got inside, I was glad to see the tables were nicely spread out (we were in the front row, but still...) and there was no Scottsdale-ish pretense. The drinks were only so-so, but I give them five stars for not having a two-drink minimum. Plus, the atmosphere had a pleasant, comfortable vibe that I haven't found at other "Improvs" in town. What's more, they had a few warm-ups acts that were decent, especially the owner. (I forgot his name but he's a cute metrosexual who's my age...LOL) And the headliner, Lynne Koplitz, was one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen. When my friends and I left, our sides hurt from laughing so much! So...would I go back? Absolutely! This club has a great ambiance that is too fabulous too pass up for a date night or Girls Night Out. Enjoy!

We visited this location around 2:00pm on Sunday. When we walked in, we went to the counter and waited for at least five minutes before we were greeted by the guy behind the counter. He seemed to be preoccupied with making a shake. The line started to fill in behind us but he still wrestled with the peanut butter canister. An employee off to the side (who appeared to be doing take out order or something) told the guy behind the counter not " to feel bad, but be quicker." As we sat down to eat, we noticed several dirty tables. And, the few tables that were clean looked like food and napkins had been swept off the table and left on the floor. The restaurant was a complete mess. It appears there were only three employees in the whole place. In addition, the food just didn't taste that great, either, but it may just have been because our expectations dropped so low upon walking in. We will not be back to this location. Poor service, dirty tables and sticky floors aren't what we ordered from the menu. Epic fail.

Brought my 10-year old son to the MIM for the first time today and was looking forward to lunch. Ugh! Was I in for a surprise. I purchased the turkey sandwich for myself, which came on bread that fell apart as soon as I took it out of the plastic container. And the turkey was grey. Yes, grey. I have never seen grey turkey meat before so maybe they should use it as an exhibit. I also ordered a hot dog for my son, which was equally as bad. It was served with a side of beets that soaked the side of the bun. I mean, c'mon....beets with a hot dog!?! And the hot dog was salty and tasted like it had been in the refrigerator for waaaay too long. We also purchased a chocolate truffle brownie that looked good in the package but was just as horrible. The only upside was the French fries that came with the hot dog, which my son and I shared, and I sure they came straight from the freezer. This is truly a disappointment. When I pay this much for food ($30+), I expect it to be good. This was the most expensive plate of French fries I have ever purchased in my life! We won't be coming back here, and unless you are willing to shell out major bucks for a big fat steaming plate of crud, I suggest that you don't, either. One star is too generous for this place.

My boyfriend has been seeing pictures of this burger joint's "food porn" on Facebook, so we decided to try it. It was an excellent decision. There are so many burger places in Phoenix that provide a great burger. However, if you'd like to kick your burger eating up a notch, this is the best place to go. Not only do they have a great amount of specialty burgers, but they also have awesome fries and milkshakes. My boyfriend got the Brulé burger, which was divine. I got a specialty burger with Havarti cheese, and it was equally delicious. I should mention that their fries are absolutely the BEST...I'm not sure what they sprinkle them with, but I suspect it's crack, some type of barbecue seasoning and sugar. (jk) Whatever it is, the fries do not need any ketchup...it will ruin them! We also had two milkshakes. He had a maple bacon shake, which was made with real smoky, crispy bacon bits, not the crappy ones that you find in the salad dressing aisle. I had the fluffernutter shake, and it was awesome...chunks of marshmallow, banana and peanut butter...Yum! If you're looking for a break from your regular burger routine, I strongly suggest you give Paradise Valley Burger Company a try. You won't be disappointed. And... don't forget the fluffernutter milkshake.

My A/C went out last week and the tech from the company sent out to repair it was a first-class jerk. When I thought there may still be issues with my unit, I called my home warranty company ( Fidelity) and asked for a different company. That's when Martin from Grand Canyon Refrigeration called me back. He came over to my house early in the morning (arriving much earlier than anticipated which was fine with me!) ... and diagnosed the issue. He explained how my unit needed to work and that the humidity was causing some of the issues with my new repair. At any rate, he was prompt, professional and extremely knowledgeable. While I hope I don't have any more issues with my AC, if I do, I'm calling on Martin and Grand Canyon Refrigeration to get the job done fast! I highly recommend this company.

Looking for a great Mexican restaurant that's not like all the others? The next time you want Mexican food, try Plaza Bonita. I like to frequent local, family-owned businesses whenever possible, and this place is no exception. From the minute you walk in the door, the festive atmosphere instantly uplifts you. The menu is filled with delicious options, but I like the tamales best. And, the margaritas are the best! (Try one with Silver Patron.) They also have a Happy Hour menu that's sure to please. The staff members are friendly and the price is reasonable. But get there early! We've been there all times of day and it's usually busy...another sign of a great restaurant!

My friend and I stopped in at Del Frisco's Grille in Phoenix earlier today. The location of the restaurant is convenient...right in the heart of the Biltmore area. We arrived in between lunch and dinner so we had two menus to choose from. We opted for the dinner menu, and I'm so glad we did! I selected the Chicken Avocado Wrap and was able to substitute steamed broccoli for the "frites." (It didn't matter, though, because my friend ordered the Shaved Prime Steak Sandwich and I ended up eating half of her frites, anyway!) Not only was the food delicious, but the ambiance was very casual yet upscale. Our waiter was excellent and attentive to our table. Jeff, the manager of Del Frisco's, even stopped by our table to make sure we were having the most pleasant dining experience possible. I have seen Del Frisco's on the local TV news segments, and have seen the restaurant being mentioned several times in social media. (I still can't get the picture of that juicy Grille Prime Cheeseburger out of my head!) The restaurant is under new management, and many improvements have been made to ensure it doesn't have the same ambience as Houston's, its stuffy predecessor. I have to admit, I had high expectations when I walked into Del Frisco's, and I left a happy customer. If you're looking for a great place to hang out with friends and famoly while enjoying delicious food and drinks, this is the place to go. My only regret? I didn't try the Nutella Bread Pudding. But I'll be back. If you try Del Frisco's even once, I bet you'll say the same thing. This place is GREAT!

I've been to many spas in my day, but I LOVE the staff - Deb and Angie - at RecReate Spa. I've been going there for about a year now for various treatments, and they are always fun, courteous and professional. I always look forward to going because they make every client feel special. They offer a variety of services, and they have great monthly discounts. If you are looking for certain spa treatments, especially laser hair removal or the HCG diet, look no further than ReCreate Spa. They are simply wonderful, and will fix you up in no time. And...tell em' Tina sent ya!!

I cannot say enough great things about these cupcakes. They are, hands down (or up?)...THE BEST CUPCAKES...EVER! I usually buy a mini box of assorted flavors, and not one flavor disappoints. The creamy, rich  icing is piled a mile high on each cupcake, and it is delicious! My favorite flavors are white wedding cake and red velvet cake. The staff is always friendly and they even provide samples. If you're looking for a great cupcake, Gigi's is the place to go.

So I went through the online service to have my mail held while I was on vacation for 10 days. It's been two days, and they still have not returned my undelivered mail. However, I have received about six pieces of direct mail in my mailbox, but my other mail is nowhere to be found. I specifically asked for them to deliver my accumulated mail, but I still don't have it. So now, I'm going to have to go 10 miles out of my way to pick up my mail, even though I had clearly put in a request to have it delivered to my home upon my return. In fact, the confirmation even says that the mail will be delivered back to my house. But, where is my mail? It's nowhere to be found. This is just another example of the laziness that exists when exceptional customer service is not the norm. USPS is claiming that they have excellent customer service and get things to us on time. I beg to differ. This is just another example of mediocre service provided by our government. So disappointed.

I started bringing my dog, Tripp, to Pet Paradise Resort on Happy Valley Road as soon as it opened. That was almost  year ago, and he has been attending a couple days a week ever since.   I am extremely happy with Pet Paradise Resort. I have looked at other places around town, but I think this place is by far the best. Julie, the manager, is extremely pleasant and manages her staff well. That is key to keeping the place running smoothly.   Pick up and drop off is also easy. It doesn't matter which staff member I drop him off to, they all react warmly to Tripp, and are genuinely happy to see him. (Plus, I can tell from his tail wagging that he likes it there, too!) And  it's not just my dog they like, I've noted that every dog and cat receives the same greeting.   If you are a dog or cat owner and considering a daycare for your pet, I know that means you want them to be taken care of in your absence. I have never felt doubtful about leaving Tripp with Pet Paradise, as I know he's taken care of while he's there. I can't speak from the cat owner perspective, but I can say that Tripp is exhausted at the end of the day, which indicates he got plenty of playtime with his buddies. What can be better than leaving your pet in good hands, allowing him/her to socialize with other pets, and then having them come home and have a good night's rest? And, you receive a daily report card to tell you how your pet did that day.   I know there has been a negative review on here about this place, and there can always be isolated incidents. But I've been taking my dog here for almost a year, and with the exception of a chipped toenail and a chapped paw (I think he got it from scratching on the door in excitement of playtime), this is a GREAT place to take your pet. If you're still uncertain, go in for a "test drive." They will keep your pet one day at no charge to see if he/she likes it there. Plus, they have Wacky Wednesdays right now where they can stay all day AND get a bath for $20!   From one dog lover and proud pet owner to another, if you are looking for a place your pet will love, I heartily recommend you try Pet Paradise Resort.

***One more thing. I saw that another reviewer said her dogs were thirsty after coming home. Tripp is the same way. It appears he likes to knock over the water dish they have set up for him. He does it all the time. He also goes "potty" immediately upon checking out of Pet Paradise because he has been trained not to go to the bathroom indoors. I'm sure he does #1 throughout the day, but #2 he saves for afterward. As far as the smell, Tripp rarely smells upon leaving Pet Paradise, but it's got to be expected when you have your dog in a room with a dozen other dogs. Again, everyone has a different experience.

This company is AWESOME! I had an old couch and love seat I couldn't even GIVE away to three different charities. I was so frustrated that I finally called 1-800 GOT JUNK. I'd heard the company's commercials on 96.9FM, and thought the "Magic Finger" was a bit odd, but nevertheless...I went online and saw the pricing. I called the company and was told I could also receive a $10 discount for going online. I am NOT kidding...within ONE HOUR, the GOT JUNK crew came to my house and took away the old furniture within minutes. They were fast, friendly AND I was actually charged much less than what I was quoted over the phone. I ended up paying less than $80 and got rid of the junk. It was well worth the price. This company is the "real deal." Too bad they can't haul away ex-husbands or boyfriends....

This store is close to my home, so I am in there at least once a week. I can easily get in and out of the store, which is excellent for convenience shopping. The store is immaculate, and I can easily find anything that I'm looking for. I have found every staff member of the store to be pleasant, helpful and accommodating. In addition, the staff that work in the pharmacy are also some of the nicest people I've met. They know who I am, and make me feel welcome and appreciated to be coming to their pharmacy. I also applaud CVS' move to stop selling cigarettes. I think this is a  progressive company, and is committed to the health of our country. I prefer this store over the Walgreens that is in my area. I find Walgreen stores to be dirty, with lots of stuff laying in the aisles and no one to help.  In addition, the Walgreens rewards program is a total joke, while I always get heaps and heaps of coupons at CVS. I choose to visit this CVS over any other store that sells similar products and provide similar services in my neighborhood. If you're in the North Valley, and you need to go to a CVS store, this one is the best...

I called Johnny Locksmith to change the locks on my home. Less than 24 hours later, the locksmith, Mendel Beck, came out and changed them quickly and efficiently. He was professional, helpful and friendly. I had to leave for an appointment, so he made sure he completed the job in time. I also used the $30 for $60 coupon found on Yelp, which saves some $$$. I called them because they had great reviews on Yelp. They did not disappoint. Great service, great price!
