(Review for by the slice ) Thin and soggy. Over priced 1 slice with three toppings ( they just add it to an already cooked slice and then reheat it) was $4. If I'm over paying for pizza I'd rather go to Johnnys at cave creek and Greenway. They have thin but not soggy pizza and they make the sausage and mozzarella fresh in house.

I understand contracts. I understand cancellation  policies. Long story short they didn't receive my mailed cancelation notice ( they wouldn't let me cancel in office for some reason that day). That's my fault I should not rely on someone else to do their job. So I canceled at the moon valley location in person. Plus I cancelled my credit card but they have some agreement with capital one that allowed them to access my new account ??!!  so I continued to pay for kids club/daycare  while I was not a member. The club is overpriced unless you need a pool or want  to pay too much for one on one training. Try fitness1 at 7th street and union hills. I pay yearly and including daycare/group fitness it is around $15 a month.  The more you pay for the gym isn't going to get you more in shape.

My ex had me watch his dog while he was out of town and I decided to have it groomed like a lion. Mission completed. They are super friendly and the place was clean. Park in the back it's easier to get in and out.

My ex never picked  his dog up ( see last review) so now  Kingsley is my dog and he loves getting groomed like a lion.

I was nervous going in the first time...... Kinda like not knowing how to order at Starbucks for the first time. The girl working the counter ( Jamie) was on top of her game. Nice, friendly and walked me through the process.  I was impressed and will definitely be back.

This review is for the lunch express. The gimmick is $7 lunches in less than 7 minutes or it's free. My friend got his food in time but mine took about 20 minutes.  Food was ok for $7. No one said anything about my food taking too long. Would feel like a jerk asking for $7 back anyway.

Hope a manager or doctor reads this and makes immediate changes to who they use for collections. Whoa. I cancelled an appointment back in 2012 and apparently still received a missed appointment fee. This $50 dollar administrative charge was sent to collections. The collection company (T.C.S. )they use is the most unprofessional, rudest,  foul mouthed I've ever had the pleasure of not paying. What the actual F. I seriously thought it was a prank call the way he was harassing and insulting me. I THOUGHT i had everything cleared up and just recently they started again. I called to correct the issue and was promptly hung up on.  The health care provided was average but the crazy collection company was horrible. After researching the collection company I found horrible bbb reviews all with identical experiences as mine. Normally I would pay a $50 dollar fee no questions asked but its way past that.

Top of the line defense lawyer. He left the prosecutor stumbling over his own words and it was clear by the judges smirk that this man knows EXACTLY what he is doing. Highly recommend if you want quality representation.

I walked in at 8am desperate with a sick little boy as a new patient without an appointment. Without my insurance card. Without my debit card. Basically I was there at the busiest time of day without any of the basics you would need to be seen. I was referred to the nicest lady who took my info, looked up my insurance and allowed me to have my payment called in. I was given an appointment within the hour and my son was able to be seen. If they were this amazing to me in this situation image how great they will be to you ( who didn't forget your purse at home. )

Never go to a place that drills your shellac/ gel  polish off. If they are too lazy to soak go elsewhere. I was desperate and will now be growing out my nails to be healthy again. I did get a lot of compliments on the length and strength of my natural nails. ( thats because I go to a place that soaks and hand files btw )

We come here probably once a week and I want to update my review for a  5 stars experience. Our server Ly tipped the scales. I have been trying new dishes and there was one I didn't like (probably not Americanized enough for me) lol but Ly exchanged it and made me happy. Great experience and we will be back

Dr. Zamora is friendly and professional at the same time. I am the worst patient EVER and everyone there is always nice to me. After my car accident Dr. Zamora has helped me with awesome adjustments. I'm thankful I have found them.

I'll try to keep this polite and to the point. If you are not on state funded insurance or desperate do not go to this location. I spent 2 hours there just to get my sons shots.   Oh and good luck getting through on the phone line. 1 hour later and endless disconnects I am told "we have plenty of staff not sure why no one answered your call". I pay full fee for service for my sons medical care and get low income clinic care in return. Will be taking my son elsewhere for more personalized care.

Pediatrix had 2 years to get it together but did not. After extensive research  I have found the best pediatric office. It is a bit of a drive for me but completely worth the amazing care. Northwest Children's Clinic is a great practice.

This location is awesome. They always are super helpful and once even gave me trouble shooting tips over the phone to empty our company printers "waste toner" (don't worry, I didn't know what that was either)They are friendly, cost efficient and they deliver.

When I ordered my food at the counter the cashier verbally asked for a tip. What?! I just lost my appetite. I haven't even had a bite of food and will never be back......Looking for Mexican food? Try Villas which is nearby and always great.

I was way out west at my grandmas house and upon her request to pick up pizza I found this place nearby. I ordered over the phone and they couldn't tell me the total including tax which made me nervous. Upon walking in I freaked out...... Did I just make the mistake of ordering pizza from a dive bar? I was not greeted. Ignored while the bartender tended to a table. So I got to stand there full of regret a little while longer. I paid (The large deluxe pizza was $19.09 btw), drove back with my dive bar pizza and drum roll........... It was amazing. The crust was hand tossed but thin. ( love it ). The toppings were layered in between cheese. ( also love it). Don't be fooled by the dark dive bar atmosphere because this pizza is legit.

From booking to my actual visit this is now my favorite hotel I have ever stayed at. We stayed for my birthday weekend and walked across the street for live music at copper blues and arcade games at gypsy bar. They have bikes for you to borrow during day , awesome views and beautiful decor. Very reasonably priced as well.

Great for a date night. We caught live music next door at the Copper Blues and then played in the Arcade. The inside felt a little run down and some games didn't work but it was a unique experience and will definitely be going back. It seemed a little empty but I actually liked it that way.

Found a dog in the middle of the street, saved him from being hit by cars- found owner's Facebook after phone didn't work. They worked at 101 towing. Lady on the phone was weird. Took dog to business where everyone recognized him but refused to give the dog owners info because why? You could be an undercover cop.  obviously some shady stuff  going down here. Beware.

Still a 5 star daycare!! The daycare was great when he started and in the last year they have made so many improvements. My son started in the 1 year old room and is now in the 2 year old room. They allow the children the chance to get comfortable with going potty in the bathroom. The staff is great. still love it.

I'm cranky. (I'm on weight watchers and saved all my points for pizza) Long story short my order got screwed up. I was ready to cancel my order and give up. The manager fixed it in a professional way and I respect the customer service. Now excuse me while I eat my favorite comfort food from my favorite pizza place.

Quick run down. I called store to confirm they had the part I needed and quantity I needed. I arrived at store and was told to stand in line at customer service. 10 minutes later I was directed to go wait at the PC section. They brought me a connector that wouldn't work. 20 minutes later no one could find the adapter I was assured was available. No one offered to call other locations. They did offer me an apology.

I went to a free class with my coworker and loved it. Some background on me I have been working out with trainers for 3 years. I have used diet plans, HCG, weight loss clinics, prescription drugs, injections, fat burners and have even met with a plastic surgeon who told my only option was a tummy tuck. I officially started OTF Sept 22 and in one month I feel like my body has completely changed. I have lost no weight but my before and after speaks for itself. I go 4 x a week. It's expensive. There's no child care. But if you look for excuses you can find them with anything. I can't wait for the moon valley location to open up.

I found an injured dog in the middle of the street and took him (turned out to be a her) to Ark. I explained it was not my dog and just  wanted to just make sure she was ok. I feared she would be put to sleep if I took to pound. Dr. Hatfield and his assistant took pity on the poor dog. They gave me all the information to take her to the humane society and even provided me with an xray on disc at no charge to give to the humane society. I ended up fostering the little dog with a broken hip and she has since been placed for adoption. Thank you to Ark for their charity to this helpless animal. Their rates are reasonable and I will be bringing my dogs for their care from now on. Highly recommend.

I eat dinner here a lot with my toddler son. Slices of pizza are $1.50 so I don't have to flip out when he decides he won't eat it. The staff is amazing. (Very nice in a friendly comfortable way )  I tried the bloody  Mary build your own bar this morning and I liked it. Not fancy but decent and close to home. The salad and pasta dishes are priced too high for the quality coming in at around $15 so I stick to the pizza.

2nd DATE UPDATE  I'm in love with Orange Theory. Currently down 4 pounds in the first 2 weeks of the weight loss challange.  I actually know how to work out now and can use the skills in the gym on my own. If you need a helping hand to get into shape or add to your fitness routine this is it. Highly motivational group setting. The best trainers. The best music. Just the best.

I love this place. My first visit was worth every star. Our waiter (j.k. Was his name) was the perfect level of excitement and knowledge to make our first visit an event and not only dinner. We had crab and a catfish dinner. ( we also had a side of vegetables that were a level 3 medium heat but they were not edible. Too hot and I like hot) They forgot to bring one order of crab and took the veggies off the order because I couldn't eat them.  The food and customer service won me over on what could of been a terrible experience. The wait was 40 minutes but actual wait was 10 so don't go too far.

Imagine my horror when I found out Bosa (A DONUT SHOP) was going in to my work complex. Well, forget the diet because this place is good.  While I was waiting in line another customer introduced me to the apple fritter. We discussed the possibility of crack being an actual ingredient. I can assure you I am addicted. They sell out fast so get them while they are there.
