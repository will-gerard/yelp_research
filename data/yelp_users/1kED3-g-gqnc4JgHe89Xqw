Majerle's gets 4 stars from me for 1 reason and 1 reason only.  Hip hop karaoke on Tuesday nights!!!  That's right, you heard me, Hip Hop Karaoke.  It was awesome.  Walked in with a big group after the Suns game, and it was packed.  Even so, the hostesses went out of their way to find a bunch of open tables and pushed them together for us.  Service wasn't nearly as quick as I'd like, but I try to be realistic.  When you're in a crowded sports bar right after a local sporting event, it's gonna take a few minutes to get your drinks, and I'm cool with that.  After people had a couple of drinks and loosened up, the karaoke lineup was classic!!  It started off with a tiny girl singing Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg.  Then came the Beastie Boys and Salt N Pepa.  And that was enough, I was hooked!  In the business of full disclosure, I don't think it's advertised as Hip Hop Karaoke, I think it's just referred to as karaoke.  That's just what it's become known as between me and my friends because that's all we've ever heard/sang there.  Which is awesome if you've never experienced it.  Dan Majerle and a few of the Suns rolled there after the game too which was kind of cool, added another fun dynamic to the drunken sing a long.  Didn't have a bite of food so I can't comment on that.  But I did have a hell of a time and next time I can stay out late on a Tuesday (not nearly as often as I'd like) I will definitely be back!!

You know those times when you want to go as far away from your office as humanly possible but know that you still have to be back in an hour to avoid getting bitched at? Well I work in Tempe and That's A Wrap in Midtown Phoenix is so that place for me.  Their food is fresh and delicious, and considering how insane their lunch rush is, they do a pretty solid job of getting you in an out of there pretty damn quickly.  So, let's see. I've been there twice now during my "I've got to get the F out of Tempe this second or I may actually shoot someone" moments, and was pleasantly surprised on both occasions. The first time I went, I had the Buffalo 66 wrap, because if you've read a single one of my reviews, you know that I am incapable of saying no to Buffalo Chicken anything. The chicken breast was tender and extremely flavorful and the sauce was nice and spicy. The vegetables were really crisp as well.  The second time I went I got the Alota Fajita wrap mostly because I wanted to see if I could say it out loud without bursting out laughing. No real surprise, I could not. It was your run of the mill fajita wrap, again very tasty and flavorful, but not quite as good as my buffalo chicken wrap.  The place is very vegetarian-friendly, pro-natural ingredients and locally conscious, which I like, but in the business of full disclosure, it was just a little bit much. I don't want to pay $2-$3 for a can of shitty "all-natural Black Cherry soda." Gimme a break. By all means, save those options for the marks with fat wallets that think buying the all-natural soda is making a positive impact on the environment, but do the rest of us a favor and throw some affordable regular ppl options out there as well.  Minor rant aside, I am a very big fan of this place and will continue to flee my office for it.

This place was disgusting, and of course by disgusting I mean awesome.  And I suppose I also mean disgusting, because lets face it, Pomeroy's is not intended for the faint of heart.  A group of us came pummeling on Saturday night after Amber W. and the Second Time Ever boys were kind enough to give us a Sunnyslope Art Walk preview (which kicked ass by the way) and immediately I was hooked.  $2.75 Amber Bocks ALL DAY and a late night menu with grilled cheeses, chicken fingers, and mozzarella sticks? Where do I sign up? Like seriously, that is my holy trifecta of late night bar food, and this particular bar food was delicious.  And I can say that with great confidence because believe it or not, I wasn't drunk, so I could actually taste it : )  Be prepared to wait though, because the service for certain members of our party (sorry Jordan) was SLOW.  Yes, the table was filthy and no one once came over to clean it.  Yes, the clientele was a bit on the unwashed side.  And yes, there were at least 5 people in there that wanted to kill me for no other reason that I made the mistake of walking in with a designer bag.  But listen, Pomeroys make's ZERO excuses for itself, and really, what self-respecting dive bar should?  That said, before my next visit to Pomeroys, I will dirty myself up a bit and dress in the finest wife beater I own, and it will be on, because no amount of salty bar patrons will stand between me and my $2.75 Amber Bocks, so don't even try...

I hate Best Buy. How dare you even call yourself "Best Buy" when you are nowhere near the "best buy" on anything? Your prices are inflated to a point that I find offensive and your staff has to be some of the rudest, most entitled (to what, I cannot tell you) group of individuals I've ever met.   Was there a couple years back with Collin S. to easily get the worst customer service I've ever received while trying to buy a giant HDTV. The main TV salesman straight up refused to help me. I asked for his assistance several times, he ignored me and was just a cocky son of a bitch like helping me was somehow beneath him. It took everything out of me not to unleash a YOU WORK FOR ME ASSHAT on him, but somehow I refrained, probably because I am a lady : )  I ended up having to seek a manager who must've slapped his employee upside the head as all of a sudden he stopped being an asshole and was willing to help me. Thoughtful of them, don't you think? Willing to help me spend $1,000 at their store? That is really just soooo generous of them.  Anyways, I do not like Best Buy. The only Best Buy I like is in a tiny little town called Anderson, South Carolina because everyone who works there is polite and I only go there once a year over Thanksgiving when I'm in town visiting my grandfather. It's in the middle of nowhere so it is the calmest Black Friday Best Buy in the world, I am convinced.  To make a long story short, if you must go to Best Buy, avoid the one on 20th St & Camelback like the plague, and hop on a plane to Greenville, South Carolina, you'll thank me, I'm certain of it.

Eh, to be honest, as much fun as I had partying with my fellow Yelpers on Sunday, I can't give this place a sparkling review.  As much as I'd love to give a neighborhood sports bar props, this place just did too many things wrong for me to comply.  Went there with a bunch rowdy Yelpers to watch the NFC Championship game on Sunday and was fairly disappointed.  For starters, as a sports bar and Cardinals viewing destination that had been promoting themselves as "the place to watch the big game," they seemed grossly unprepared for the crowd they got.  For starters, I sat at my table for about 15 minutes before I gave up on a server coming over to take my drink/food order, and went up to the bar to order and take the middleman out of the equation.  Only when I went up to the bar did I learn that they had run out of glasses!!!  This is where it gets good though.  Their drink specials that I was interested in were their $2.50 20 oz domestic drafts, pretty good deal if you ask me.  And since they had run out of glasses (definitely not my fault as I am not their barware supplier) and the bartender asked me to get a bottle instead, I naiively assumed they would honor at least a similar deal to the one that they were promoting.  This is where I was SORELY mistaken.  Not only did they not give me my 12 oz bottle for the same price as the 20 oz draft that they were unable to serve me, they actually had the nerve to upcharge me to $3 per bottle!!!  Needless to say, I was a bit incensed.  And it had nothing to do with the extra 50 cents per drink, I just thought it was poor business practice...a bit of a bait and switch, if you will.  After the initial poor service and swindling of my hard earned $$, the bar ended up being okay.  Of course I will have to attribute at least 75% of this to the wonderful company of my yelp compadres, who I hate to disappoint with my less than stellar review, but I have to keep it real.  The TVs were big and plentiful, the food was fair.  I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap which wasn't bad but my fries were SUPER cold and therefore inedible to me.  But the bar's sorry excuse for a smoking section is what threw me over the edge and made me want to puke on more than one occasion.  We had the bad luck of being sat in the general vicinity of the door that led outside to the smoking section, and every time the door was opened either by a server or a patron, you could literally see plumes and plumes of smoke wafting into the restaurant.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't stay even 5 minutes longer after the Cards won to celebrate because I was coughing and my eyes were starting to water.  I am willing to give Gallaghers 1 more shot under the parameters that there can be no special event going on because they were terribly ill equipped to handle it, and mainly due to the fact that they had tons of TVs and it is relatively close to my house.  As long as the don't run out of glasses again of course...

My coworkers go to Los Taquitos for the women, I go to Los Taquitos for the tacos. Specifically, the hard shell tacos. They are literally the best hard shell tacos I have ever had in my entire life. Carne asada, chicken, fish, it doesn't matter, they're all delicious and incredibly flavorful.  There is nothing glamorous at all about this place. Strip mall location, plastic tables and silverware, whole nine yards.  That said, the food really is fantastic and the price is right. I usually get out of there at lunch somewhere between $6-$8 and I aint mad at that.  Just do yourself a favor and don't go during the week their episode airs on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the Food Network as the line is out the door.

Okay, here's another one of those places where I wanted to be selfish and keep all to myself, but alas the last couple of times I've gone it's been almost empty so I've decided to get over myself and share with you the sheer deliciousness that is Calabria.  Get off the 10 on 7th St. and drive North a bit and you're bound to run into a plethora of impressive looking dining options. From America's Taco Shop, to the Living Room, to The Main Ingredient, there is something for everyone. But if you want one of the best made to order pastas or sandwiches in a traditional style Italian deli, then look no further than Calabria. It is as authentic as you'll find in Phoenix.   Unfortunately I was never able to experience Calabria at its old, larger location downtown complete with specialty grocery store, but it sounded a lot like DeFalco's in S. Scottsdale, another personal favorite of mine. What makes Calabria about 800 times more preferable to me is the considerably personalized service and the minuscule wait time. I am anal and running late about 90% of my life, so the majority of my run-ins at Calabria are call-ahead pickups. After about the 3rd phone call the owner knew me by voice and exactly what I liked on my turkey sandwich. Best f'ing turkey sandwich in Phoenix, mind you. Trust, I've been looking forever.  What made me finally decide to write this review however took place last week at my first ever sit down dinner in Calabria. My date and I sat down and decided to try something other than the deli sandwiches we always get, him opting for the chicken parmigiana and me a simple plate of spaghetti marinara in addition to my craved turkey sandwich : )  We order our food and the owner asks me why I ordered two entrees, to which I replied I was just really anxious to try his marinara sauce, as I like to consider myself a bit of an aficionado about, and then it happened. He looks at me right in the eye and says, "You know we're BYOB here, right?"   That's it, I died and went to heaven. Delicious, authentic Italian food in my backyard that was NOT going to upcharge the shit out of me with their wine/spirits collection?? I might have actually fainted on the spot.    And yes, as you probably could've guessed by the tone of this review, their marinara was flavorful and exceptional as well.  Between the wonderful service, the delicious food, the rock-bottom prices which I think I failed to mention above and the fact that I can bring my own booze Calabria has made a lifer out of me!

Oh. My. God.  How have I never been to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles after 8 years in the Valley? Shame on all of my friends for waiting so long to take me to this hidden gem!!  Think fried chicken with your breakfast of waffles, eggs, and cheese grits sounds gross?  Well you have never been more wrong my friend!  I don't quite know how, but it was oh so right.  And I am not a big meat with my eggs fan (i.e. steak and eggs) fan in general so no one was more surprised than me when I was left craving some more of that delicious fried perfection after Brad E was kind enough to share some of his with me.  The waffles are dusted with cinnamon and melt in your mouth.  The cheese grits are wonderfully authentic to a southern girl such as myself, and let's be honest, who in their right mind would ever complain about a freakin' Mason Jar filled to the brim with delicious kool-aid.  I ordered WAY too much food for myself (shocker) so I didn't even get to sample the mac and cheese, corn, and other incredibly enticing side dishes that were scattered about my table.  Yes, the place is kind of cramped and you'll wait longer than you want for your food, but deal with it, you'll be thrilled you did.

I love the Bikini Lounge.  For those out there that know me, you might find this hard to believe, because I typically require a modicum of ambiance, attentiveness from waitstaff, and clean bathrooms from the places that I frequent.  And Bikini Lounge provides absolutely NONE of this!  But for whatever reason it works, and I don't wind up wanting to run out the door and jump in a vat of antibacterial solution...go figure.  Bikini Lounge is the epitome of a dirty dive bar, complete with shady Grand Ave location, bitchy bar staff that looks like they want to cut you if you make the cardinal mistake of trying to pay with a credit card, and on the positive, a kickass jukebox.  I was in there Friday night after a terribly stressful day and proceeded to knock back about 5 small pitchers of Bud Light by myself, and embarrass myself later on in the night, you know, typical Friday.  But what was atypical was the fact that I spent under $20 and I even bought a couple rounds for friends!!!  Now this is what I call a recession-friendly drinking establishment,,,  I really ended up digging the fact that no one there, staff or patron, gave a shit about me and how I was doing.  Strange, i know.  It was surprisingly liberating not having to worry about other people around me because NO ONE there was worried about you.  Call me crazy, but I dug it, and I will totally be back.

There's something incredibly charming about this place. Old and kind of dark, I live a couple miles away from this place and I had no idea it was there. Food was really more 3 1/2 stars but the fries were bomb and I was starving so I'm feeling generous enough to bump it up to 4.  I was with a fellow Phoenician who requested to remain nameless because he is weird. Eh fuck it, I don't care that much, it was Collin S. Mystery solved, woohoo.  Now on to the burgers. All beef ground patty was on the thin side, but I was totally cool with that as it allowed me to pile on 8 feet of toppings! For once I've found a topping bar that wasn't ill-kept and made me feel like dozens of chidren's unwashed hands had been rifling through everything. Flavorful and tasty and CHEAP. Have I had superior burgers? Absolutely! But not for the price of a McDonalds happy meal and that was A-OK with me.  Bottom line, Original Hamburger Works is the perfect place to go when you want a quality burger and fries at fast food prices with the luxury of a liquor license.

You know that crazy friend you have that you always wind up almost dead after you hang out with? They're super fun but you know it's probably not in your health's best interest? That, boys and girls, is the Hidden House.  I love finding bars where you cause so much ruckus that you swear they're about to kick you out at any moment, but for some insane reason, they let you stay.  A bunch of Yelpers and I visited this little dive bar gem on a random Thursday night.  I immediately felt bad for the rest  of the unsuspecting patrons (all 6 of them) who had no idea what they were in store for.  Any time you have a kick ass juke box, INSANELY cheap beer (like cheaper that Bikini Lounge cheap,) pool tables, and filthy bathrooms, things are bound to get ugly. And by ugly I mean 7 people headbanging, singing and dancing at the top of their lungs when no one else is, playing air guitar with pool cues, and rickrolling the bar an unmatched 4 times.  And still, they let us stay...a beautiful thing.  By the end of the night, Heather, the wonderful bartender actually seemed amused by our antics, as did the clientele, who I was pretty sure were planning to murder us all come Ric Astley song #2...  Basically, great dive, great service, place I could go straight from the gym and not feel even a little bit bad about it, and I like that.  Couple in the fact that I can walk home from there and was drunk for $8, I'm pretty much in heaven.

I can only review Martini Ranch on Sunday nights, because that is seriously the only night I have ever gone, but it is the freakin shit on Sunday nights.  Reasonably priced drinks, great setup with a bunch of different rooms and plenty of outdoor space for the smokers.  But what makes it so great that it's getting the elusive 5 stars from me you ask?  That's easy, a little known local bad that goes by the name of METALHEAD!!!  Metalhead is a hard rocking ass-kicking hairband that takes dedication and commitment to an entirely new level.  I don't even like calling them a cover band because I don't think it does them justice.  Sure, they sing Guns n Roses and Aerosmith with the best of them, but they do it in tight leather pants, leopard print muscle shirts, wearing wigs reminiscent of those bands glory days.  And they never break character.  Not one single time during their 3 set show.  it is freaking awesome.  Do yourself a favor, go there on a Sunday, quit being a cheap ass and pay the $5 cover to get in, as you will get far more than that back in entertainment, and watch what happens to you.  I don't care who you are.  You will literally lose control over your more demure sensabilities, your inhibitions will go flying out the window, and you will be fist pumping, dancing around, and singing at the top of your lungs in front of the stage along with the band and the rest of the bar for that matter, and you will love it.  And then you will thank me ;)

I'm almost afraid to post about Caffe Portobello for fear of ruining it.  It literally is perfect the way it is.  One of the very few things I miss about N Scottsdale...my beloved Ports.  How I miss spending every waking moment of my weekends relaxing at Ports.    BEST bartenders around, seriously!  No weak pours, super attentive, and bartenders that actually pay attention.  It's rare in Scottsdale that bartenders are actually cognisant of who and how long people have been waiting for drinks, rather than serving their friends and whoever they want to take home later than night first.  Wine list is small, but VERY good and quite reasonably priced for the area.  50% of bottles of wine every Tuesday as well...  Huge patio with the majestic McDowell Mountains in the background.  Seriously one of the best places to watch the sun set and enjoy a glass of wine.  Place gets fairly crowded during happy hour for precisely this reason.    The clientele consists locals, and not the bad kind.  Everyone there lives in the McDowell Mountain Ranch area and could walk there if they wanted...of course no one walks anywhere is Scottsdale : )   And the food??? I cant believe I almost left out the best part!!  The food is actually REALLY good.  Several tasty authentic Italian pasta dishes, but also does American fare very well for the less adventurous.  Seared ahi appetizer is divine.  If you're ever in N Scottsdale and looking for a place to grab a bite or a cocktail with friends, do not miss Ports!

Alright, not going to lie.  This place kind of took me by surprise.  I must have driven by Frashers at least a thousand times over the past 7 years that I've been in AZ.  Never once felt compelled to go in and check it out.  Then over the holidays earlier in the year, my brother and his family came in town to visit me from NYC.  To put it simply, they are VERY hard to impress or even please for that matter.  I love them to pieces but they are the epitome of the Park Avenue princesses who find flaws with everything!!  The Phoenician and Mary Elaines (back when it was still there) were incredibly "sub par."  I took them to Mastros and they acted like I was trying to poison them.  Then, believe it or not, after taking a suggestion from someone who worked at the hotel, we wound up at Frashers.  I assumed we were doomed from the second we walked in the door.  The interior?  Very understated and even had a bit of a bar crowd for the last few minutes of happy hour.  Not a good start for the upper east siders...  Then my brother opens the wine list, sees a bottle of Silver Oak he usually pays around $200 for in the city selling for $70, and decides to give it a shot.  And thank the lord we did!  That food was incredible!  And I mean everything!  My filet was absolutely divine!  Literally beat the pants off of Mastros at a much lower price.  My brother and his kids could not believe how good their food was either.  It was hilarious.  His wife practically couldn't speak the entire meal.  My nephew ordered some BBQ sampler if memory serves, and he killed the entire thing, saying over and over again how it was the "best chicken, ribs, steak etc that he had ever had in his entire life!"  Much to his mother's dismay of course : )  Anyways, if you want a ridiculously good meal that will completely catch you off guard, go to Frashers.  Great food and great wine at almost half the price of what comparable places in the valley would run you...what more can you ask for??

4 1/2 stars!  Oh Defalco's.  You drain my bank account and you take up my entire lunch hour just driving to and from but I don't care, because you are delicious.    By far the best authentic Italian deli in the Valley, I have yet to have one thing there that I didn't love.  They have a gigantic menu of options, featuring everything from hot and cold sandwiches, pizza, full hot pastas and entrees like the intoxicating chicken parmigiana, and a stacked deli case of side dishes with easily the best pasta salad I've ever had.  Family owned and operated which is another littler perk in my opinion.  Let's put it this way.  My boss is usually in town for a week to a week and a half every month and he still manages to eat there at least 6 times...it's that good.  They freshly bake all of their own bread daily, which is excellent.  I prefer the Crispy Baguette with my sandwiches because it is oh so flaky and wonderful.  If you've got extra $$ to throw around they also have a quite nice-sized grocery selection right in the deli featuring authentic Italian delights.  I'm talking everything from 30 different types of aged balsamic vinagrette to over 100 different bottles of Italian wine.  The only reason I have to take a half a star off is because if you make the fatal mistake of going there between the hours of 11:30am-2:00pm M-F and you did not have the foresight to call your order in advance, you will sit there for 45 minutes, EASY.  But now that I have mastered the timed call in approach, it is wonderful and you should all go if you haven't : )

Damn stoners forgot to make my food!!! How could you do this to me Cheba Hut?? I've loved you for 9 years! I understand the argument of not being allowed to watch the flatscreen TV during work hours is an important one, but being that apparently talking to each other is too big of a distraction to not miss orders, I'm gonna have to side with management on this one.  Aside from the literal temper tantrum I witnessed by the majority of the staff with regard to the aforementioned TV, screaming obscenities and all, everything else was pretty crappy too. I got a salad for the first time ever at Cheba Hut, specifically the Southwestern Chicken Salad, and boy oh boy was that a mistake!! After waiting 20+ minutes for my shitty salad, I am handed a bowl full of brown-edged lettuce with mayonnaise-based chicken salad looking suspiciously like it came out of a can scooped on top.  Nowhere did I see the spicy marinated chicken breast, salsa, and other southwestern accoutrement I was promised by the description.  The manager/owner/person of authority came out at the last second to earn this second star by giving me a free rice krispie treat for my troubles, which was freakin' delicious.  This broke my heart Cheba Hut, as I pretty much survived only on your Dank Nugs and Kind Pinners through college, but you did me wrong today.   Get your shit together, get some fresh (preferably local) vegetables, and get the whiny, pre-pubescent boys out from behind the counter and I'll consider coming back.  Until then, thanks to the god awful salad and non-service, you guys are cashed.

Damn you Yelpers you steered me wrong!!  I agreed to go to this place only after reading all of these glorious reviews on Yelp, only to be in for a rude awakening upon my arrival.    I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the phrase you get what you pay for has never rang more true for me.  I love Middle Eastern food, like seriously, no joke.  So how excited was I to try a new Middle Eastern restaurant not too far from my office with ridiculously low prices?? You can probably figure it out from there.  The meal started out okay.  I got a pretty darn big piece of Spanakopita for $1.95, which excited me.  It was decent, not very flavorful to be honest but for $1.95 I'll eat them all day long. My boss ordered a side of hummus to start, and his story was pretty much the same.  We then both ordered the Chicken Kabob sandwich for a whopping $3.99 and I was stoked. Until it arrived that is.  I took one bite and could tell right away that something was not right, with the chicken I mean.  After I taste a funky piece of meat, that's it. I will not be taking another bite. It just won't happen.  I did however perform a little surgery on one piece on a side plate to discover that as I suspected, the inside was pink, as in NOT FULLY COOKED.  It took a bit out of me to not get sick right there at the table.  I was hungry though so I tried to eat around the chicken, only to discover that this was the dryest chicken kabob sandwich I had ever had.  I probably should've figured that out by watching my boss douse his with the entire appetizer of hummus to add some flavor, but what can I say, I like to figure some things out on my own.  All in all my meal ending up costing less than $6, which was sweet, except for the fact that I didn't really eat anything.  Oh, and I should probably mention that we got back to the office and my boss didn't stop bitching all afternoon about how badly his stomach hurt. I believe that's called salmonella : )  Anyways, I'm a bit surprised that I had such a lousy experience with so many great reviews before me.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe all the reviewers before me were blinded by the price, regardless, I won't be back to find out.

I have been searching far and wide for a decent pizza/salad place I could get to on my lunch break for, oh, two years now. Fuck decent, this shit is delicious!!  Thanks to the lovely Sunny B.'s review on the Spinato's in Central Phoenix, I decided to do a little digging and see if they had one anywhere near Tempe. And that is when I found this total hole-in-the-wall little shack of heaven a block away from Tempe Marketplace.  I know we've all been taught not to judge a book my its cover, so seriously, do not let the meager building scare you away as there is a serious gem hidden inside.  Chicago style thin crust pizza, oven baked to a perfect crisp. Heavy on the tomato sauce just like I like it, and a heaping house salad served almost immediately after ordering it. And they also have a bunch of gluten-free options for you unlucky Celiac sufferers out there.  I am in love. I will certainly be back. After they get their liquor license, I might never leave.

How do I love thee House of Tricks?  Let me count the ways:  1.  The cozy cottage and gorgeous bar area complete with twinkle lights make me forget I am right off of Mill Ave which is a definite plus.  2.  There are plenty of delicious options at lunch and dinner for my non-meat eating friends.  3.  One of the most underrated wine lists in the Valley at a far lower markup than other restaurants of its caliber in the area.  Example, several years ago before Turley blew up and became a trendy wine, I used to enjoy bottles there for $45!!!  Crazy, I know...  4.  Their food is fresh and divine.  Their dinner menu changes seasonally and their creative chef always offers very inventive specials that you wish would be put permanently on the menu.  Some of my favorites are the Ahi tuna and the oh so tender Petite Filet Mignon.  5.  They recently added a Happy Hour!!!!  (Multiple exclamation points because we all know I like the sauce : )  )  6.  House of Tricks became the first restaurant in all of Arizona that my food snob of a mother insists I take her to every time she comes in town to visit.  I have to take one star away (well, really only a half a star if I had my way) because their lunch prices are a bit steep and it upsets me that my wallet prohibits me from eating there as often as I'd like.  If you've never been there, run don't walk.  It is truly a gem in one of the dullest dining parts of the Valley.

Oh Caffe Boa, what happened to you? I used to love you, like seriously love you but christ how you've changed! I know, I know, you've gotten yourself a fancy big-named chef and  in turn completely forgotten your identity. Case in point: A $19 lunch SPECIAL? Is that some sort of joke?? Your lunch "special" will run me $20 without even purchasing a drink? Doesn't sound very special to me.   Caffe Boa has turned into an expense accounter's establishment only with their insanely unrealistic pricing which has increased dramatically over the last several years. Inflation is one thing but this is price-gouging at its finest. Plain, meatless pasta entrees don't increase in price 60+% over 5 years due to inflation and higher food costs, they just don't.  Again, I used to love Caffe Boa. I spent just about every celebratory dinner I had in college there. Shit, I even hosted one of my graduation parties there! But those days are over.   I find it incredibly ironic that I used to be able to afford Caffe Boa in college when I was on a strict budget, and years later I'm working and have more disposable funds at my leisure and it has firmly priced itself out of my budget. Crying shame...

Alright, I can't be too detailed here because I only stayed for about 45 minutes, but I'll do my best.  I don't pretend to be an expert on coffeebars especially since I don't drink coffee, but after living up the street for this place for a few months and always seeing it packed when I'd drive by, I jumped at the chance to check it out when some friends were there earlier today.  I gotta be honest, this place was nuts.  I was confused upon arrival and had to look at my watch to check the time because I thought I'd just walked into a nightclub.  This place was PACKED.  I mean not a seat open at 5:00 on a Tuesday.  Music was blaring inside!  My boss called me from NYC and literally asked me if he was interrupting my bar time because it was so loud.  Anyways, loud (bad) music aside, I still had a good time.  The people watching was fantastic.  Such a wide variety.  I mean you had so many different angles covered.  You had your hipsters typing away on their laptops trying to look very important, the tortured artist at the table next to me feverishly writing in his journal, the section that I can only call the hairdresser's corner because all of their hair was immaculately coiffed and standing about 3 feet high, to my friends who were doing actual work at a table, sending out invoices believe it or not.  And then there was me, jaw gaping open the entire time, obnoxiously staring at everyone around me trying to get my bearings.  Since I did not eat or drink anything, I should probably point out that I will be returning to Lux for the people watching alone.  It was that good.  I'd imagine it would be mildly difficult for me to work here with the loud electronica music blaring in the background, but that's alright, I'm willing to sacrifice work for just a little while longer : )

AZ88 gets 5 stars for having the best Buffalo Chicken Sandwich in all of Arizona.  It is incredible.  Messy as hell but incredible nonetheless.  Oh, and just when you thought it couldn't get any better, it comes with waffle fries...WAFFLE FRIES people!!!!  It also comes with a delightful little fruit salad and slightly tangy ketchup which is to die for!  I go to AZ88 anytime I want to have a nice swanky time and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it.  it is the perfect place to have any sort of celebration because it is kind to people of all budgets.  Don't get me wrong, if you want to spend a crap load of $$, AZ88 will be more than happy to oblige!  Their cocktails are all quite pricey but they are HUGE and potent, so I excuse them for that.  But if you are just there to eat or have a drink or two, you can easily get out of there for $20, which isn't too shabby.  I go for lunch all the time and sit at the bar and hang with Jamel, my fave daytime bartender, as we sit, watch, and laugh at all the people who are confused by the HE/SHE bathrooms and can't figure out how to get in them. Just push open the door people...  The lunch crowd is quite eclectic, but the dinner crowd is very different.  They rather match the modern and voyeuristic design of AZ88.  Basically what I'm getting at, is these people want to be seen, and they want to be seen specifically in AZ88.  But again, we all have our moments (especially in PHX) where we want to pretend we're someone and somewhere else and AZ88 is the perfect place to provide said transport.

I promise I will keep this one short and sweet because there isn't possibly anything further I could say about this fabulous little bistro that hasn't been said already.  Anyhow, I just moved to Midtown, don't know a soul within 30 minutes, but by some shred of dumb luck happen to be in walking distance of Fez.  Many times have I come in by myself to grab some food or a drink at the bar for no reason other than to get out of my place, and the staff and patrons have always been lovely and welcoming.  Never did I feel awkward for coming in by myself, which was very refreshing.  At this point I've worked my way through about half the menu, and it's all quite good.  They seem to always have the perfect dish depending on how hungry I am, not too mention some killer cocktails and an always bumping happy hour.    Simply cannot wait for my friends to come visit so I can show them my fabulous neighborhood bar...how lucky am I?!?

Went back to Fez last night after taking a several week hiatus, and all I kept thinking over and over again was what the hell is wrong with me??  Why would I ever take a break from such a delicious and fabulous place?!  Went after the heartbreaking Suns loss, convinced that I could not be cheered up, and somehow Fez managed to do the trick.  Not sure whether it was one of the 5 reverse happy hour specials we ordered (chicken phyllo packets, bruschetta, 2 orders of fez fries, and lettuce wraps, what we were hungry!!) that did the trick, could've been the two-for-one drink specials after paying $9 for every beer at the game, or it may have been our fantastic waitress Sarah who snapped us out of it.  Either way, everything was spectacular and Fez just got bumped to a 5 star.

Now those my friends, were some $12 tacos.    I know what you're thinking, who in their right mind would pay $12 for some tacos?? I know this, because I was thinking the same exact thing.  Personally, I have issues paying just about anything over $4 for tacos, because I happen to think that's all there worth.  I know I sound like a cheapskate, but I'm really not, I swear!  For a good piece of steak or a nice piece of fish, I expect to pay much more than $12, but there is something about tacos, maybe the fact that I can get spectacular ones at Loco Patron for $1 and $2 on Tuesdays that makes me not want to break the bank.  But, I digress...  I was sitting at home on Cinco de Mayo feeling sorry for myself and content to remain there for the rest of the night, when the lovely Christina P demanded that I get off my ass and come meet her for some late-evening grub at Padres.  As you can imagine, especially with my tolerance for obnoxious drunks, I was not looking forward to going to a Mexican restaurant on this holiday, where I was certain I'd want to punch every patron in the place.  However, Christina P assured me that Padres was not my typical Mexican Cantina and that I would like it.  With the promise of booze and friends, I shot out my door like lightning.  And boy am I glad I did! Yes, Padres was annoying at first with the seemingly 800 people in attendance and nowhere to park, but I was immediately put at ease with a quick beer and a fun bongo driven band to distract me.  We were sat fairly quickly considering how many people were there, and that is where my love affair with these delicious tacos began, and everything went kind of blurry from there.  At our poor overworked waitress' suggestion, I ordered the short rib tacos.  I scoffed at the price, $11.99.  I further scoffed at the fact that there were no drink specials and it was Cinco de Mayo and we were at a Mexican Restaurant.  After a little sweet-talking, she agreed to give us Happy Hour beer prices which is all I could've asked for.  And then they came out.  They didn't look that remarkable at first, oversized, which was nice considering the price, but nothing special...until my first bite.  It was literally the most tender beef I have ever had in a Mexican restaurant, at any Arizona restaurant period.  They melted in my mouth.  They were rich and flavorful.  I had to consult Nathan S. to make sure I wasn't dreaming these magical tacos up, but he confirmed I was lucid and spot on in my diagnosis.  Now those were some $12 tacos...best $12 I've ever spent.

Almost $30 fucking dollars for a Reuben?!? I understand that you're Carnegie Deli and to make matters worse you're a transplant location in a shitty Vegas hotel, but let's be reasonable here. I wouldn't pay that price in New York and I certainly wouldn't pay it here. I don't care how delicious you are, you are a SANDWICH!!  And $10-$12 for vodka sodas and jack and cokes?!? I remember the good 'ole days of living in the Northeast when one could go to one of these delis and have a fantastic lunch or even dinner at a fair and reasonable price. If Carnegie Deli has its way, those days are long gone.

Okay, after recently relocating to Midtown from the vapid vortex of the valley (aka N Scottsdale) I knew I was in for some culture shock.  After scouring yelp for suggestions, I grabbed my best friend Lisa and we took off an a little mid-week impromptu bar crawl to help familiarize me with my new area.  First stop, The Roosevelt.    Oh my God.  How much did I freaking love this place??  I literally felt like Alice and I'd stumbled down the rabbit hole upon entering this quaint and cozy little bar, especially after spending the last 3 years up north.  Where were the steroid-induced and over gelled bartenders I had come to expect?  And where was the group of young 20 something girls that looked like they wanted to rip my head off right as I walked in the door?? Every where I turned there were great little details.  A guy reading a book while throwing back a beer in the corner snuggled up into a chair, a group of interesting looking women having a great time discussing lord knows what, and of course the fabulous bartender that let my friend Lisa (literally the most indecisive person in the world) sample practically every beer on tap until she found the one she liked the best.  And don't even get me started on the beer.  For those of you that don't know me, I had a bit of a reputation back in school for basically being able to drink my weight in booze.  And yet, after two tall glasses of their intoxicating house beer, shockingly enough I had a nice little buzz going on.  No, it may not have been my first drink of the night but that's besides the point : )  Sampled some food at the suggestion of my fellow yelpers, and I don't think anyone in the world has ever inhaled a grilled cheese sandwich and bowl of tomato soup as fast as I did that night.  Sooo good.  Only reason I am taking a star away is because of the 1 bathroom.  A situation that has proved to become a bit problematic as the place fills up.  Oh well, I absolutely loved it and will definitely return!

I hate to do this to you Harley's, especially considering how fond so many of my friends are of you, but give me a freakin' break!!  Can you say overpriced? Can you say completely un-inventive menu? Yes I know that's a made up word, but it fits so deal with it. Can you say laughable wine list?? I can, HARLEY'S.  I hate to be so harsh, but my Spaghetti Bolognese tasted like it came from Sbarro at the mall. The pasta was soggy, the sauce was flavorless, I was just completely unimpressed from start to finish. Listen, if you're going to make and serve low-grade knockoff Italian food, be my guest, but don't you dare charge higher-end prices! Don't even get my started on the $10 salad with dressing that so obviously came out of the bottle.  In the business of full disclosure, my pasta dish was 800 times better the next day, but more likely as a result of me adding my own sauce to it before re-heating rather than it magically improving on its own.  The only saving grace Harley's had for me was our server Justin. He was a doll. Attentive, courteous, and really f*cking hot. So, maybe I'm a little biased, whatever, sue me.  I really wanted to like Harley's, I really really did, but sadly, I could not. Especially not with The Parlor opening just a couple of miles up the road.

I love the Vig.  Good ole dependable Vig.  Great patio, kick ass happy hour specials, and bocce ball.  What more could you really ask for?  That's right, Stella on tap, and yes, they have that too.  I've heard their whole menu is good, but since I cannot get past their Trifecta (sliders) or their Chicken Fingers, I cannot comment.  But man oh man are the sliders and fingers bomb.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something very relaxing about the Vig for me.  Maybe it's their trumpet player that's there on Tuesday and Wednesday nights who's playing is intoxicating by the way.  Or maybe it's knowing that I can drink until I can no longer see and George and the Vig Rig will make sure I get home safely free of charge, just a kick ass service that the Vig provides (tips always appreciated of course.)  The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star place for me is the simple fact that their cocktails are priced a bit higher than reasonable.  If I'm paying $8 for a Ketel soda, I expect it to be tall and poured with a heavy hand, which these I'm sad to report are not.  I will however continue being a faithful patron of the Vig for all the reasons listed above, and you should too.

Cheap food, cheaper beer, damn fine wings and curly fries. Don't come to 16th Street expecting some swanky lounge with big leather booths. This is your classic dive/sports bar that doesn't pretend to be anything else, and thank god for that. New as of late, 10% off your check with a valid Yelp check-in!  Anyhow, tons of TVs, not a lot of servers and the place fills up quickly on NFL Sundays so make sure to get there early if you want a table. And without question this is an AZ Cardinals bar, so if you're expecting sound on a different game while the Cards are playing, think again.  Also has a big outdoor smoking patio that's covered for you dirty smokers out there.  One of the few totally solid and valid sports bar options in CenPho. We could use a couple more.

Loved loved loved this place.  Went there last night, for my first time believe it or not, with my new wonderful Downtown tourguide Will, and fell in love right when we walked into the door.  Everything about this place is right.  From the photography and other interesting art displayed on the walls to the simple fridge full of GREAT beer selections, nothing disappointed me.  The Stork Hunters were playing and don't even get me started on them, I feel compelled to write a whole additional review to talk about how much ass they kicked.  So freaking cool.  Who knew that a xylophone could be so bad ass.  Very cool crowd.  You have your typical urban hipster crowding in most of the place but you also had people like me, definitely not urban hipster and I felt very comfortable.  Everybody was so nice, again, being from Scottsdale, still not really used to that, and I just loved it.  Pretty sure I met every single person in the place by the time we left from owners to bandmembers to bartenders.  Everyone was very mellow and genuinely happy to meet you.  Can't wait to go back

Please know that this is killing me to give my team 2 stars.  But everyone who is giving them 5 stars needs to get serious.  This review is not about the arena, its staff, or even the game night experience.  This review is strictly about the team, if I can even call them that anymore.  As a die hard Suns fan who's had season tickets for 7 years, it is difficult for me to even begin to describe what a roller coaster ride it has been.  We started off terrible with no leadership, traded for Nash which breathed new life into us and sent us off running, and now we're slow and losing again, virtually eliminating all traits of what used to make us so exciting.  That's a pretty quick time period to turn a complete about face and then back again, don't you think?  The real reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because they are playing with no heart, the most insulting thing professional athletes can do to their fans.  The lack of focus, passion, unity, and determination make it difficult for me to even watch a game in its entirety on tv now.  The season ticket holders in my section don't even know what to say to each other anymore.  We all just kind of shake our heads in shame.  The only real saving grace for me has been the unexpected stellar play of Shaq, someone that was originally intended to be part of the supporting cast, not a major player.  The kind of ball he is playing is reminiscent of his time in LA, except now the man can make free throws...kinda makes my head spin : )  His intensity has been off the charts, but I couldn't blame him for wanting to jump ship after this season, to go join a team that is actually hungry, a team that actually wants to win rather than bitch and moan in the locker room about playing time and paychecks.  Instead, we fans will be forced to continue to listen to Amare whine about not being recognized as one of the premier superstars in the league like Lebron, even though he hasn't produced all year.  We'll have to watch Nash continue to cry and wipe away his tears because the big bad management group got rid of his favorite coach and traded his best friend Raja Bell, boo freaking hoo (I thought this was a business and these were grown men, obviously I was mistaken, ) as we're all forced to rally around Shaq and practical unknowns like Lou Amundson, who can't shoot a jump shot to save his life, but at least goes out there and hustles.  Believe you me, there is nothing I'd rather do than be able to update this review in the future with some positivity and more stars but that would involve them finding some collective identity and sense of urgency.  And with a home game tonight against the Spurs, I'm not optimistic...

Damn you Hail Marys, I wanted to like you, I really really did!! You're so close to my office, you have TVs in each of your comfy leather booths, you have cheaptiy cheap cheap drafts and a 99 cent Happy Hour menu!! Why I ask? Why was your food so terrible??  I went there with a coworker today all excited after reading about how good their chili was right here on Yelp, and then something awful happened. They brought me my "chili" (if you can even call it that) on a plate of spaghetti, mounds and mounds of spaghetti. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen, not to mention tasted. There wasn't much "chili" on top of my spaghetti, and it was pretty darn flavorless. My chili somehow morphed into some really gnarly spaghetti with sweet meat sauce on top...definitely not what I imagined.  My colleague ordered the buffalo chicken wrap which came with a side of hand cut fries. The fries were limp but flavorful. The wrap however was not a winner. After he removed all the tomatoes (which he forgot to mention he didn't want,) there was hardly any chicken in the wrap. He said there may have been 1 chicken finger cut up in the entire sandwich. Kind of a bummer for $8 or $9.  We were both obviously disappointed in our meal and our server knew it. He did not however care, which was kind of a bummer on top of everything else. I would've come back here and given the food another shot if the service was better, but now this will remain solely a drinking establishment for me in the future.  One day I will find a sports bar in the greater PHX area with dozens of HD TVs and buffalo chicken wraps that come with chicken in them, and chili that does not come on a plate of spaghetti, however sadly, today is not that day...

I have trust issues.  I have as far back as I can remember.  When I first read about the light rail coming all those years ago and everyone was hyping it like it was the 2nd coming, I didn't buy it.  I wanted to, but I couldn't.  I have always been a firm believer in the "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is" mentality.    Even after I moved to midtown from N Scottsdale specifically for the downtown community combined with the light rail just a short while ago, I still wasn't sure it was going to work out.  A nice idea, but just may not take. (I have issues, I know : )  )  But then came Wednesday night.  Wednesday night consisted of a little mini happy hour followed by the Suns game.  At that was it.  Trust issues out the freakin' window the light rail is the shit!!!!!!!  I couldn't believe what a geek I turned into.  I felt like a 6 year old at Disneyworld for the first time.  I finally  understood what all the fuss was about.  The cars are clean, comfy, and everyone else on there is just as geeked out as you are!  And I can't explain the incredible feeling of knowing that my car was nowhere in my general vicinity.  I wasn't going to be stuck in my parking structure for 40 minutes after the game.  I wasn't going to be followed the entire way home by Sherriff Joe's personal motorcycle stalkers.  And it felt really freaking good.    To all the skeptics out there like me, give it up.  Don't waste your time.  Just surrender to the inevitability that the light rail truly is a driving force behind the resurgence of the valley.  You'll be glad you did.  Go find your own version of Disneyworld...  : )

I can't hate on The Tavern.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of Mill Ave and I'm even less of a fan of ASU kid-infested bars, somehow the Tavern has quickly become my go-to March Madness bar over the last week.  It's got over 40 TVs, the majority of which are all HI-def flat screens, and every sports package you could ask for, which kicks ass.  What makes The Tavern better than any other sports bar with similar characteristics? The food!!!  Believe it or not, The Tavern's food doesn't make me want to puke, which is a definite plus!! They serve some of the best damn chicken fingers in the valley (extra crispy,) their mozzarella sticks are cheesy and delicious as is their buffalo chicken wrap. In the business of full disclosure, I went there with my boss last week and he absolutely detested his veggie burger, so I'd suggest staying clear of that.  I should also mention that he is the most difficult person to please when it comes to food but that is another story for another day...  I love that they turn their crappy music off for games, something I wish more sports bars in the valley would do, so we can actually hear the commentators.  I also love their big, spacious patio which enabled me to try and even out my ridiculous looking tan lines yesterday, while not missing a play of the game! And no, I am not evened out, now my back is even MORE sunburned if you can believe that! But again, not The Tavern's fault...  I have never been there at night to party with my whole aversion to the ASU kids thing, and yes, their drink specials could be a bit lower, but The Tavern is pretty top notch for game-viewing, beer-drinking, and relaxing on a Sunday afternoon...

You removed the illustrious Buffalo Chicken Wrap from your menu?? Was it something I said? Did I do something wrong? Do you just hate me??  I went there for lunch a few weeks ago with Collin S. mouth salivating for my delicious Buffalo Chicken Wrap and what I found was a new menu. A menu rife with typos mind you. With one very important menu item missing. I felt like I was being simultaneously punked and sucker-punched. Damn you Tavern! It's a good thing your drinks are still cheap and you're right off the lightrail or we would've had some serious problems. Now put my damn sandwich back on the menu if you know what's good for you!!!

Thank the lord that I live so freaking far from Charles David and that Kerland Commons is outside of my typically traversed bubble. Because if it wasn't, my ass would be officially broke. And I mean broker than broke. So broke that I would be begging on the street corners of N Scottsdale to feed my high end shoe habit.  Charles David has style, elegance, and most importantly a sale rack in the back that encompasses half of the store's collection at any given time. This is literally the only store I will buy shoes from. I love them. They cover everything from giant spiked heels, to classic pumps, to slip on slides and every single pair is somehow comfortable and doesn't make me want to rip off my feet at the end of the night. Craziness, I know.  Anyhoo, Charles David is heaven, plain and simple.

I think I am in love with my masseuse.  Seriously.  If it meant that I would get free massages nightly from Nathaniel, I very well might have proposed.  This is why Massage Envy gets 4 stars from me.  I am a firm believer in the phrase "you get what you pay for."  And at the ridiculously low prices, $49 for an hour followed by $39 every additional hour you go within the same month, I'd say Massage Envy passes pretty much every expectation I had going in.  Sure, you're not going to get the amenities and ambiance of a full day spa, but you're also not going to pay $150 for a more often than not sub par massage (in my experience.)  That said, I'd say Massage Envy is definitely worth a shot.  I could care less about the girls working the computer who to be honest I've only had quite pleasant experiences with and the lack of a steam room, as long as Nathaniel is working there, good luck keeping me away.

God bless you Robert M. there are now 3 sushi places in Phoenix I will eat at!! There's something endearing to me about a sushi bar with no liquor license and no qualms about letting you bring a 6 pack in with you of whatever your little heart desires. Never been anywhere else similar to it, but I gotta be honest, I kinda dug it.  Anyhoo, Robert was kind enough to bring me here in early June upon hearing I had never been there before and boy was I glad he did! Of course I drove past the restaurant several times before realizing it was in a strip mall, but I forgave the drab exterior the second I arrived and saw a packed restaurant aflurry with wait staff flying around every corner attentively serving their patrons. I was late (shocker) and our waiter was there to grab my sake out of my hand to chill it before my butt fully hit the seat. I was impressed.  Next there was the fish. Holy fresh as the Pacific melt in your mouth fish! We shared the octopus salad which was pretty tasty considering I'm not a huge octopus fan (solely due to texture.) Next I had whatever the toro special of the day was which was freaking exquisite and Robert and I split a catepilar roll, also quite good.  All in all my Hana experience was more than satisfactory. My biggest complaint living in Phoenix is a lack of fresh fish and sushi on demand and that was certainly not the case with Hana. I could've gone for a little more variety and adventure with their signature sushi rolls, but I really can't complain. Quality was definitely up to par and I will be back.

Stop what you're doing right now and get your ass over to Spoken. I don't care that you're at work. 98% of this gorgeous little boutique is 50% off, now MOVE MOVE MOVE!!!  Okay, now that we've gotten that out of the way, I'll let you in on a little secret. I have bought every single "special occasion dress" as I like to call them over the last 5 months there. A big first date dress, 2 birthday dresses (yes, I dig an outfit change,) a theater cocktail dress, literally, you name it, Spoken's got it and I've bought it.  Spoken has two very kick ass things going for it. For starters, they have clothes for every budget. What I mean by that, is if you want to spend $300-$400 on a dress, you can, and it'll be gorgeous. That said, you can also spend under $100 on a dress and it will be just as gorgeous. **Note, with the sale going on right now, go get your True Religions, your Citizens of Humanity and a million other top tier designers for lower prices than I've ever seen.  The other thing that sets Spoken apart from other boutiques I shop at is the store owner Amber. When I say homegirl knows what she's doing, I mean homegirl is on point!! She's fantastic. Let's me roam around the store picking things out myself, but by the time I get into the dressing room, she has an entire additional stack of clothes that she has selected just for me. And guess which stack I end up buying, yup, the one she picked out. She's got an eye for style and body type like I have never seen. Things that hanging on the rack I never in a million years would have grabbed for myself, are now some of my favorite and best-fitting dresses/tops etc. And I'd also like to mention that if it doesn't fit/look right, she'll tell you before you can even get both feet out of the dressing room.  All in all Spoken is a GREAT local business run by a knowledgeable and helpful fashionista. Such cute stuff and only a handful of each garment so you don't have to worry about running into 75 people around town all wearing your same outfit, which whatever, call me a snot, I FUCKING HATE!!  And yes, you can bet your ass if you see me running around Yelp in Bloom tonight, I will be in yet another of Amber's fabulous hand-picked pieces.

This place gets 4 stars from me for 1 reason only...CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CH CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP drinks!!!  Drink specials like whoa!  Hell yeah!  And isn't that why one goes to a sports bar anyways?  Maybe that's just me but I doubt it.  Furthermore, I contemplated grand theft for the first time in a long time after seeing all of their TVs.  HD as far as the eye could see, 60+ inches everywhere, it was truly a sports fan's paradise.  I was afflicted with serious TV envy when I realized how much they dwarfed my TVs at home.  Their happy hour specials were awesome, $6.50 BIG domestic pitchers that served at least 4 full pint glasses, 4 sliders for $2.50 that were of WAY too much for me to eat on my own, $5 personal 1 topping pizzas, and an attentive wait staff that could have probably been around a bit more but definitely wasn't MIA by any stretch of the word.  Look, I could sit here and tell you the food was gourmet, but I'd be lying.  It's a sports bar and we have to be realistic.  If I were you, other than the drinks of course, I would go for the wings.  They were super cheap as well and definitely the strongest part of our meal.  Oh, and the curly fries were delicious :)  I was teetering around the 3 and a half star point until I went in the bathroom and saw that they had Team Trivia contests 2 separate nights a week and Karaoke another 2 nights...SOLD!  Great place to catch happy hour and watch a game, but wouldn't stray too far off the beaten path of normal bar cuisine, could get a little iffy.  I will definitely be back, my friends and I all had a great time.

Made it back to my old college stomping grounds after a several year hiatus, and all I gotta say is Chompies, it's good to be back! Why oh why did I stay away so long??  Went there for lunch the other day with the always lovely Gabi K., after I was hit with an insatiable desire to have breakfast for lunch.  We arrived at 12:30 and the place was pretty packed but we were seated right away.  Now, I should probably fess up to the fact that I have been ordering the same exact thing at Chompies for 8 years now, and see no sign of switching any time soon, because it is perfect.  I get the greek omelette with American cheese, an everything bagel, and hashbrowns, and it is an instant party in my mouth.  Gabi ordered a soup and salad combo (which I didn't even know they had since I never get past the breakfast page) and it truly looked delicious.  Seriously looked like one of the better looking salads I've seen around Tempe.  In the business of full disclosure, our waitress did falter with both of our orders.  She forgot Gabi's soup and she did not make the sub to American cheese in my omelette as I requested.  Neither of us are difficult diners though so we rolled with it and continued our gabfest.  What really pushes Chompies over the 3 star line for me is all of the extra goodies in and around the display cases in the front.  Black and white cookies? Check! Real, authentic chocolate rugelach? You better believe it!  And my personal favorite, acutal Wise brand Cheese Doodles!!! Not Cheetos, of Cheese Puffs, or any of that knockoff crap, actual delicious, heavenly Cheese Doodles, my favorite snack of years past when I lived in the Northeast.  You wouldn't believe how difficult they are to find in AZ!   But not to worry, I can get them every time that breakfast for lunch craving hits, and I almost always do.

Yell at me, call me names, beat me up, just PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't make me go back to Saddle Ranch!!  Ick from beginning to end.    I made the mistake of bringing a couple out of town buyers here last night, a Monday mind you, thinking it would be fun and kitchy.  You know, they could watch a couple lushes get on the bull and made fools of themselves and fall off, rustic cowboy atmosphere, good enough for entertaining out of towners anyways.  Oh how wrong was I??  Just my luck it was their 1 year anniversary party and the placed was packed.  And packed with the worst kind of people.  It looked like a Real World casting call had thrown up all over the bar.  Skanky, underage girls literally falling over chairs, and being annoyingly in the way all the time.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure that all the steroids ever injected in AZ were in that bar too.  And get this, they were all wearing crystals on their shirts...puke.  It took FOREVER to get served at the bar which we obviously didn't stay at long because my clients wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP.  The only reason in gets any stars at all is because I cannot entirely turn my back on any place that serves cotton candy.  That would be the 5 year old in me : )

Holy f-ing hotness. I literally watched my date's eyes tear up and stream down his face repeatedly, in unison with mine. See, after we took a trip to Jamaica last year, we foolishly assumed that no transplant restaurant in the middle of Downtown Phoenix could compare to the legitimate heat the actual island's dishes offered. Boy have I never been so wrong.  While The Breadfruit's offerings are quite tasty, I cannot stress enough that this place is not for the faint of heart. After 10 years of living in Phoenix, I add jalapenos and hot sauce to just about every single dish I eat, and the spiciness The Breadfruit threw my way totally kicked my ass. I think we may have gone through 6 pitchers of water over our 90 minute meal. At the end of the night, my date's head was so overheated, he actually felt his ears popping repeatedly. (**Note: Whether that was actually happening or my date was just a pussy, we will never know.)  Anyhow, on to the food. I've been hear several times now and am hooked on the Jerk Chicken Plate and the Jerk Chicken Salad. I've also had the scallop entree which while tasty and this pains me to say, was just too freakin hot for me. The Jerk Chicken is spicy as shit as well, but the mango infused dressing and pineapple bites do a wonderful job of cooling your mouth. I think I only needed 3 pitchers of water my last trip : )  They recently opened up a bar next door called The Rumbar. This is what really excited me about this place. Over 50 brands of authentic Jamaican rum to choose from, with all hand muddled ingredients to throw in. Their mojito is sugary and delicious.   I've also been blessed with excellent service each time I went, however I do have an issue with a particular Duke of The Breadfruit who is a freakin server there. Stop checking in to your work! It's cheating!!!  Next time you need your sinuses cleared out, look no further than The Breadfruit. I'll be the chick with 6 empty water pitchers surrounding her plate.

Move over Ray's, you've been replaced.  Well, this review is obviously a long time considering how many times I order it on a monthly basis and the fact that I am on a first name basis with every single delivery driver.  Mamma Mia's is the best NJ style pizza I have been able to find in Phoenix, and that's saying a lot, since I've been on the hunt for 8 years and counting now. Oversliced slices, reasonably priced pies and wings, smokin' lunch special (2 slices and a soda for $4?!) and most importantly freakin' delicious.  When I lived in South Florida, I used to drive 25 min each way down to the beach in Ft. Lauderdale to get myself a couple slices of Sonny's NJ Pizza. It was perfect. Thin crust, crispy but still able to fold, heavy sauce, light cheese. Perfection. Thank the lord it's now practically in my back yard.  Mamma Mia's barely misses 5 stars for me as they are a tiny bit heavy on the cheese in my opinion, but if that's what you're into, it's practically perfect.  That tiny technicality aside, I love this pizza. They have two convenient Cenpho locations, delivery offered at both, which is both quick and efficient.  Pizza is always still hot by the time it gets to me.  It wasn't until Yelp Rocks last week that I realized I was eating Mamma Mia's pizza for the 3rd time that week, and I still hadn't reviewed it. Perhaps a tiny selfish part of me was trying to keep Mamma Mia's all to myself, however after meeting Frankie and the rest of the wonderful team in person, I couldn't deprive my fellow Yelpers any longer.

Totally just made a believer out of me. Woke up this morning with a flat, which naturally put me in the world's worst mood all day. Schedule an appt online (very nifty feature by the way,) only to arrive here hours later, still in the world's worst mood. What can I say, when I get there it can be tough to pull me out. Until my first experience at this Discount Tire that is...  Place is running like a well-oiled machine. Tons of employees, everybody hustling, not a soul standing around, efficiency at its finest. I have a roofing nail in my tire which I yelled at my bf about for an hour this AM as he lives in Cave Creek and my argument was that no one in Phoenix (where i live) can afford new roofs, so this obviously happened in his neck of the woods and was therefore his fault. Great argument, I know.  Anyhow, patch job totally complete (at 5pm on a Friday nonetheless) in 35 freakin' minutes! And get this, they call my name to tell me my car is ready to go, I go to pull out my wallet, and the lovely man says "NO CHARGE." Are you freakin' kidding me?! No charge?! Is it because I'm a girl? Not likely, I look about as good as I felt when I walked in there. Is it because of my charm? Certainly not. Remember the whole "World's worst mood" sentiment from earlier? Sadly the lovely employees were not spared. Is it because I scheduled an appt online? I doubt it because that's just stupid. I asked repeatedly why there was a total of $0.00 on my receipt, and all they kept saying to me was "Just come back and see us again." What a novel freakin' idea. Repair my flat for free on some tires I definitely didn't buy there, and hope that leaves a good enough taste in my mouth to purchase tires there next time I need them. You know what? It totally did. Bravo Discount Tire! Most pain-free car fixing experience of my 11 years of driving.

I'm sorry, I hate to be a downer, but this place is terrible!!!  I work in Tempe and was sooo excited when a new nice looking place opened on Mill Ave.  For all of those of you who've spent time on Mill, you know it is somewhat lacking in the area of fine dining, or even fair dining for that matter.  Anyways, we went there pretty consistently for a while after it opened, mainly because it was new and we were all deathly tired of the same things for lunch every day, and it started off alright.  Alright is literally the best compliment I could give this place.  The pizzas and salads were OKAY, the sandwiches pretty gnarly to be honest, and it was all incredibly overpriced.  That said, we are a fickle bunch so "alright" worked for us for a few months.   That is until La Bocca took a HUGE slide downwards.  All of a sudden our lunches, that solely consisted of salad and pizza started taking a full hour and a half to get through!  How it takes 90 minutes to shell out a couple of salads and pizzas I will never understand.  As more time passed, our orders were consistently screwed up, the wait staff was terrible, never refilling water/soft drinks or even bothering to come over and explain why after 60 minutes, NONE of our food had come out!  After several consecutive trips of service like that, we crossed La Bocca off of our list for good.  It was a bummer.  I had very high hopes for what looked like a cute little pizza/wine bar/cafe at first.  But spending almost $20 at lunch for a salad and pizza that take over an hour when you're one of 12 people in the restaurant?  No thanks...

This is the closest thing to a New York bagel as you'll find in Phoenix. Proper consistency, texture, I dig em. They make a mean breakfast sandwich too. In addition, they have a bunch of the traditional NY deli fixins like Wise brand potato chips and Cheez Doodles, black and white cookies, Dr. Browns etc which is important to this transplant.  Now, the bagels may be a little bit salty like many of the other posters have noted before, but you know what, beggars can't be choosers. And when it comes to finding quality NY style bagels in Phoenix, we beggars.

I like Maizie's.  Well, I've been 3 times in the last week so I guess I should say I like Maizie's a lot.  I went for this first time a week ago with the fabulous Dottsy Z for a little much needed Happy Hour after work, and it was pretty packed.  Dottsy was kind enough to secure seats for us at the bar while I fought the wonderful PHX rush hour traffic.  They had $3 off all wines by the glass which I must admit was a pretty impressive selection, and they had a decent list of appetizers that all cost $5.  We each ordered some wine and decided on the buffalo chicken dip.  HO-LY-CRAP this dip was good!!  I love the taste of buffalo wings but I hardly ever eat them because they're really messy and I invariably cover myself and whatever I'm wearing in them.  And as attractive as looking like a 5 year old is...  Anyways, this dip is like the answer to my buffalo chicken prayers.  Came with a huge helping of pita slices and chips and it was delicious!!  Definitely going back for the dip alone!  Luckily I don't have to.  Next time I went was Monday evening, and wouldn't you know it?  $3 burger and fries specials EVERY Monday night!  And they were gooood.  That pretty much ensured that I will be there every Monday from here on out until my arteries are so clogged that I have a heart attack and need to have a bypass.  If that means I get to keep imbibing at Maizie's, I will take my chances

AJ's I love you, but we're in a recession and it's like someone forgot to tell you.  Alas, you have become out of my price range which saddens me greatly.  Lucky for me, in walks Fresh and Easy with their kick ass low prices and their very reasonable single serving prepared meals.  I live by myself and cooking stresses me out, so I used to do most of my grocery shopping at AJs and I'd pick up dinner there regularly as well.  I would spend at least $150 every time and it always felt like my fridge and pantry were empty when I got home.  Finally made it to Fresh and Easy last night, spent $60 and my fridge and freezer are PACKED!!  Not only are there prices for name brand items I like for example my sugar cereals (I'm eternally 12 years old, I know) about 50% of what they used to cost me at AJs, but they also offer rotating "Deal of the Days" for $1.99!!!  Cheese and Pepperoni pizzas on sale last night for $1.99.  Needless to say I bought like 12.  I will agree with some of the reviewers before me that the fruits and veggies did leave a bit to be desired but I'm willing to overlook that since I much prefer pizza to fruits and veggies : )  The staff was incredibly kind and helpful.  I asked a woman giving out free pizza samples (heaven) a question and upon hearing it was my first time there she gave me a huge free soup to take home with me!  Then a guy ran up to me at the checkout and handed me a coupon for $5 off my bill!  Totally surreal and wonderfully unexpected.  Needless to say they won me over and I will be coming back.

I love Salon Krush which is what it's actually called, not krush Salon as it is listed here.  It is an adorable little salon smack in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale, in the same complex as E4 and Jackrabbit.  You know those salons that right from the moment you walk in everyone there is kind of sizing you up and it feels like they are intentionally trying to make you feel uncomfortable??  Well Salon Krush is sooo not that place and thank the lord for that!  To be completely up front, I have never gotten my hair cut or styled here.  I come to Salon Krush solely for Susan Deems, their ridiculously skilled and fantastic esthetician.  First I should mention that she is medically certified, so she can do Laser treatments and all that other fun stuff.  I literally do every treatment I physically can/can afford with her.  Not only is she quick as lightning with regard to waxing/laser and other slightly painful treatments you really don't want to drag out, but she's got an incredibly kind demeanor about her that immediately puts you at ease.  I'm sure many of the ladies on this site will agree that a certain comfort level with your waxer is essential to a positive experience : )  In my opinion, her pricing structure is extremely competitive.  Additionally, she bases them off of your needs, so as long as you're not the hairiest person in the world, you won't pay like you are which is VERY cool, something that no other salon that I've been to does.  I also get my facials from her and please believe that they are fantastic!! I don't even walk out of the salon when they're over, I literally float I am so relaxed.  She takes her time and doesn't rush through them, complete with neck, shoulder, and hand massage as well.  She also has her crazy med-spa certifications for facials so if you want micro-dermabrasion or any of the other high tech age-defying chemical peels that are out there, she can do those as well.  Sorry, not sure how pricing runs on those.    I do however know that she is always running specials and deals so do yourself a favor and check out Salon Krush.  Everyone is super friendly there, they always have a HUGE candy dish which is a gift and a curse, and you'll feel at ease right when you walk in.

SCAM ALERT!! Now, I'm kind of disappointed that my first Yelp of 2010 has to be a negative one, but whatever, this place really pissed me off. According to the fine folks at Merriam-Webster, organic is defined as "developing in a manner analogous to the natural growth and evolution characteristic of living organisms; arising as a natural outgrowth"  So that's their play. They will overcharge the shit out of you under the guise of being organic, and good for the environment, and blah blah blah.   However, upon my first and penultimate experience with this place, I learned that this was not the case. I brought in 5 dresses and 1 shirt to be dry cleaned before a trip abroad over Christmas. As I came to pick them up, they had 4 of my dresses and my shirt completed, and it cost over $70!!!! These were not ornate, delicate, vintage, lacey dresses by any stretch of the word. Cute? Absolutely! But delicate to the point of over $15 per dress? I don't think so.  If you've been paying attention you'll realize that one of my dresses was not returned to me. That's because they damaged it. Somehow, they caused to deep purple top color to bleed all over the grey bottom half of my dress. And this is what they said to me: "Don't worry, this happens ALL THE TIME. It's a super easy fix! We just throw a bunch of CHEMICALS on it to remove the bled dye."  Hmmm, throw a bunch of "chemicals" on my dress to fix your errors after I am paying top dollar to have my belongings "organically cleaned??" Me thinks something is not adding up as it should...  And this is the best part, after they damaged and treated my lycra/polyester dress (not fancy material in the slightest,) when I came to pick it up, they had the gaul to charge me $12 for it.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

Umm, made from scratch Sloppy Joes and fancy Mac and Cheese?? Pshh, you had me at Sloppy baby...  The fact that there are any sub-par reviews of this place shocks the hell out of me. I had my third meal at District last night, and just like my previous two, it was spectacular.  In the business of full disclosure, my friend and I were going to try Moira for the first time, but alas it was closed, and obviously a sign because we stumbled a few blocks further south to District and had quite the satisfying meal.  We walked in about 6:45, and I'm sad to report the place was empty.  We took a seat at a cocktail table in the bar area so I could watch the hockey game (seriously, I am a dream date) and perused the bar menu. A nicely mannered waitress approached us almost immediately and remained attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal.  The coolest thing about the bar menu was their new take on the pairing menu.  No longer do you have to be a wine conosseur to enjoy the Chef's special menu.  District offers three separate 3 course tasting menus, one featuring a wine pairing, one featuring a cocktail pairing, and one featuring a beer pairing all for between $12 and $14!  I mean, how cool is that?  I challenge you to find a better bargain for such high-quality fare complete with booze...give it up, you can't, I've looked.  If you don't know already, District offers about 10 or 12 different Microbrews on tap an obvious plus for a beer drinker like myself.  Being the difficult diner that I am, I asked for the Sloppy Joe Sliders off the beer pairing menu so I could get a couple other small things and try a bunch.  Yes, I am an adult, and no, I can't not order a Sloppy Joe when it is featured on a menu, I'm sorry, I just can't.  And thank goodness I lack that sense of propriety because the Sloppy Joe Sliders were freaking fantastic!! 3 perfectly sized mini toasted buns filled with possibly the best, spiciest Sloppy Joes I have ever eaten. Seriously, I sucked down my Apricot Ale seemingly in seconds thanks to the District's take on this classic!  Just don't tell my Mom, she still convinced I'm quite fond of her Mamwich Joes...  I also had to get a side of their Andouille infused Macaroni and Cheese, another embarrassing thing that I just can't not order if it's offered on a menu, and it did not disappoint.  Cheezy, creamy, gooey perfection. My only complaint is that I was so full from my Joes I barely made a dent in my Mac n Cheese...alas, there's always next time.  My dining companion ordered what must have been the biggest freaking burger I have ever seen, but to be honest I did not really look or care because I was far too enamored with my meal to be distracted by anything else.  All in all, I had a spectacular meal at the District, from beginning to end.  If you haven't checked out this gem at the new Downtown Sheraton, do yourself a favor, you'll be in for a treat.

What the hell happened to Cafe Roma?  I used to LOVE this place.  Well, love is kind of a strong word but I sure as hell ate there a lot.  They used to have the best lunch special around.  A slice of pizza and a salad for $3 and some change.  It was awesome.  Was the pizza great?  Of course not.  How about the "salad" (and I use that term loosely because it looked more like the chopped up lettuce and tomatoes you'd find at a taco bar)?  Well, I think my brief description pretty much answers that.  But it was $3 and I didn't care.  The broker I got, the more I ate there.  It was a wonderful relationship.    And then I walked in around 2:15 yesterday to grab a bite there for the first time in 2009 and everything changed.  I ordered my lunch special of a slice and salad like always, and went up to the register to pay, and the guy working the counter looked at me and goes "$6.49 please."  I almost passed out.  I thought it was a joke.  Who does Cafe Roma think they are??  I understand that times are tough and maybe they have to raise prices a bit to stay afloat, but almost doubling their prices??? No no no my friend, not cool.  For a shitty reheated slice of pizza that had been sitting out for 3 hours and some taco dressings.  I looked up at the guy and asked him when they raised their prices, and he ignored me!!!  He heard me ask the question, looked at me square in the eyes, and turned around and walked away.  Anyone who has met me knows that I do not take being ignored very well.  I went to sit down at my table fuming mad and started eating, thinking about all the things I was going to write in my Yelp review, looked down, and saw a gnat crawl out of my salad.  Swear to God!!!   I almost threw up, stood up, and walked out.  Downgrade!!!

Decided it was probably time for me to review Sidebar, especially in light of the fact that I went there twice in one day.  Yes it  was embarrassing, yes they remembered me, and no I didn't care.  Why?  Because Sidebar is the shit.  Has totally become my fave neighborhood spot.  Great seedy feeling bar, even though the decor is gorgeous and the bathrooms were spotless.  I love feeling like I'm in a place where I could easily get into a bit of trouble, the good kind, and Sidebar gives delivers every time.  Also love the fact that they feature works by some great local artists on their walls.  So great that I thought Sunny B. was going to steal a painting this weekend, but that's another story for another day : )  Sidebar evokes a nice laid back, sultry vibe, thanks to it's cozy quarters, dim lighting, plentiful couches, and soulful music.  They have a DJ spinning there on the weekends which leads to an impromptu dance floor in the middle of the place every time.  Great place to relax with friends, throw back a couple drinks and chat.  Music isn't so loud you have to shout, which is always a plus.  Almost forgot to mention the fact that they are open until 2am 7 days a week!!!!  They feature a GREAT selection of beers as the reviewers who came before me have said, and easily the nicest bar staff I have encountered since I moved to downtown PHX.  Gotta give a little extra love to Will G. who takes exquisite care of me every time I'm there.    They also feature a few small apps there but I have yet to try any.  With the sheer amount of times I've been in the past 2 weeks alone, it can't be long before I do.  If you haven't been, Sidebar is definitely a must visit.  Tell your friends, just not too many ;)

I've got two words for you people.  Well, technically one word and one hyphenated slang term.  Regardless, it is FREE WIFI.  That's right, at the freaking nail salon!  I realize that I have issues when I judge my nail salons solely upon internet access, but it is a beautiful thing when you can get a pedicure in the middle of the workday and not get busted for it because you are fully functional from your laptop the entire time!!  That said, it is also a nicely sized, CLEAN facility that is surprisingly inexpensive considering it's location on the corner of Central Ave and Camelback.  I used to pay an extra $5 in Scottsdale and at least another couple of bucks in Tempe as well.  The nail techs are all delghtful and speak english as well, which as most of you know, is not often the case.  I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes before I'm in a chair with my feet in hot water, including New Years Eve, which is pretty incredible.    My toes always come out looking lovely which is the icing on the cake.    Price is right, quality is right, staff is right, wifi is oh so right, consider me a customer for life!

I am embarrassed at how much I love Mojo Yogurt. Like, I miss it when it's not around me. Like I would probably marry and move in with Mojo Yogurt if it asked me. I have to have it at least once a week or I get the shakes. I fear my love affair with Mojo Yogurt is turning into more of a crack addiction than the fun fling it began as.  Regardless, Mojo Yogurt is better than all the new tart tasting, not terrible for your health, fro-yo places of late because it actually tastes good. Are you listening Dallas G??? Some of us like our sweets to actually taste like sweets, a foreign concept, I know. North Eastern elitist snob or not...  The Mill Ave. location is the best in my opinion (and yes, I've been to just about all of them) because it is the biggest, has the largest array of flavors, and can accommodate the most people so I never feel crowded. Also, they let you sample as many flavors as you want!! Dangerous, as I've seen people more than once (shakes her head at her colleagues) come in, sample several flavors, and leave without buying anything.  Anyway, Mojo has flavors like chocolate that actually tastes like chocolate, cookie monster that tastes like cookies in cream, always at least 1 non-dairy option for the lactose-intolerant, and a couple tart flavors for the more health-conscious who like their fro-yo to elicit the reaction of sucking on a lemon.  They have a huge do it yourself topping station with everything from freshly cut strawberries, blackberries, crushed up snickers (my personal fave) and sprinkles to off the wall additions like fruity pebbles, miniature gummy bears, and captain crunch.  Anyways, it's delicious, and you should go. Or you can be like Dallas G. and rebuff yummy treats in favor of being smug . The choice is yours.

Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.  Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!  Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.  My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.  I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.  I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!

Listen, moving is obviously the worst thing in the entire world, at least for me it is. Every time I move it's awful. I don't like to pack, I don't like to lift, I don't like all of the residual dust in your face. Yes, I'm a prima donna and I hate being inconvenienced and I REALLY hate moving.  That is until I hired Just-In Time Moving. I actually hired them to pack and move me, remember that whole prima donna thing? Yeah, wasn't joking... Anyhoo, I must have had the two most reliable, responsible guys in charge of my haul in the entire world. This is easily the 5th or 6th time I've moved since I've lived in Phoenix, and no one even comes close to these guys. They may be a little bit pricier than some of their competitors out there, but if you value little things like your belongings and unscuffed walls, you'll pony up for the pros.   As nice as can be, as professional as can be, and trust me, if they meet my ludicrously high standards, they'll meet yours too.

I'm going 4.5 stars here as I have no idea what else they could have done to bump themselves up to 5 other than perhaps not be 50 minutes away from my house which isn't their fault, but hey, I'm selfish, so there.  Now that the longest sentence in the history of Yelp is finished, I will get on with my review. I went here a few weeks ago with my manfriend and his manfriend after deciding we were all collectively too lazy to cook, and crap am I glad we did! Upon entry, I was immediately pleased with the old fashioned, rustic decor. I'm talking antique wooden benches by the hostess stand, deep browns and reds throughout the restaurant including a giant copper wood burning fire pit in the center of the main dining room.  Now on to the food. I'm not terribly into game meat to be honest so I knew right from the beginning I was going steak. Ended up settling with their beef tenderloin which I paired with the best god damn mac n cheese you have ever had in your entire life! I got broccolini as well which was also delicious but I would've married that mac n cheese that night. Steak was cooked perfectly, incredibly tender and flavorful, and oh so juicy.  The boys were a little more adventurous than I. My manfriend's manfriend going with the trio of quail, elk and buffalo, which he killed every last bite by the way, and my date got the elk, which he talked about for 36 straight hours, so I have to imagine they were both pretty darn good.  On to dessert, which for some reason we felt the need to order even though none of us could move after our entrees. I got the smores. That's right, I said SMORES. If I'm going to be honest, it was a tiny bit rich for my taste, but whatever, they had smores on their menu and that made me love them that much more.  Decent wine list pretty reasonably priced in my humble opinion. Settled on a few bottles of the Row 11 Pinot to pair with our dinners that only ran us $45 a bottle if memory serves.   From start to finish, I had a caesar salad to start, the petite filet with 2 sides, smores for dessert, and my share of 2 bottles of wine and my bill was like $90 or something like that. I didn't need to eat for another 2 days mind you.  Oh, and this probably goes without saying but the service was impeccable. Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable and sweet, never rushing us for a second even when we were the last table in the dining room savoring our desserts and finishing our last bottle of wine.  Run don't walk to Cartwright's, you'll be glad you made the trip.

Oh hell yes!  Now this is what I'm talking about baby! Freshly prepared pastas, delicious inventive salads, and fancy pizza I actually like?? I must be dreaming as this simply cannot be Phoenix.  In the business of full disclosure, I'm not a fan of fancy pizza. I prefer crispy, thin crust, NJ style pizza. For The Parlor however, I make an exception. The dough is just a touch fluffy but fantastic. Each pie is cooked to a perfect crisp in their wood burning oven. Their ingredients are top notch, many of which they actually grow themselves.  I've been to The Parlor probably 4 or 5 times at this point, and I have yet to eat/drink anything that wasn't mouth-watering. Yes, the pizza and salads are great, but the pasta, holy crap THE PASTA!!! Being a young girl growing up in North Jersey, pasta (spaghetti bolognese in particular) has always been my comfort food. To the point that it's the only thing I ever bothered to learn how to cook, and I hate to cook.  But after sub-par Italian restaurant after sub-par Italian restaurant in Phoenix, I found myself cooking far more than I like. I am thrilled to say that I am have to cook no more! Because The Parlor makes one hell of a delicious bowl of Pappardelle Bolognese. The pasta is the perfect texture, practically melts in your mouth. The bolognese sauce is thick and meaty as it should be. Literally, heaven.  I always order the small size, for the reasonable price of $10, and have never once finished it. I feel like the large size may feed me for a week.  Another great thing about The Parlor is their beer and wine list. Extensive and cheap!!! And by cheap I don't mean 2 buck chuck, but I mean they don't mark up their bottles nearly as much as many of the other local establishments that I frequent, and this recession-living girl appreciates that. Huge list of beers on tap, and they serve them in pitchers. Something about a nice restaurant willing to serve me my beer in a pitcher that warms my heart, can't explain it, it just does.  I think it's fairly obvious that I am turning into a regular at The Parlor and am actually pleased about it, and if you're ever in the hood, you should be too.

I am at the point where I'm making up reasons to go to The Main Ingredient, it's gotten that bad. I love it. Jumbo Coney Island Hot dogs, baked crusty green chili mac and cheese and more microbrews than I can even count all set to old school East Coast hip hop? Be still my heart!  I can't remember the last time I've been to a place with that killer of a vibe. Actually, I'm lying, I can totally remember. It was Hanny's in January of '09. Restaurants never cease to amaze me at how little attention they pay (it seems) to the music/background noise they pump out into their business as if it's a minor detail. I for one completely disagree as the music and vibe are the difference for me between a quick 45 min meal or a 3 hour one. And you can guess the difference between the tabs/tips on the latter one.  Anyhoo, the food is always consistently fresh and tasty. Nothing overtly fancy, mostly sanwiches and salads with a few just like mom made favorites like mac and cheese and grilled cheese thrown on for good measure. Everything is pretty much in the $6-$9 range as well which is awesome. Service matches the vibe, very unassuming and laid back but never lazy or unattentive. I remember being sad when Lisa G closed her doors but I couldn't be happier with the restaurant that took her place!

Ready to pack my bags and start my new life as a fly on the wall in this fantastic establishment I stumbled upon completely by accident. It all started when 2 non-yelpers (the nerve!) and I were a touch under the weather (re: hungover) and driving around aimlessly looking for a place to have a boozy brunch up in North Phoenix. It was literally by the grace of God that we were brought to Gino's. According to my GPS, we had arrived at Ollie's Omlette House. After our retarded asses drove around an empty complex for god knows how long, we finally all agreed upon the fact that Ollie's Omlette house was no more and Gino's had taken it's place. No longer willing to drive another foot, we decided to walk in to Gino's and give it a shot.  How freakin pumped were we that we did?!? I'm actually going against my better judgment even telling you about the goldmine that is Gino's, because at first I was tempted to keep this treasure trove all to my greedy little self. However, in the spirit of Yelp, I've decided to share.  Upon first glance of Gino's, it looks like a little beat up diner with a bunch of New York paraphernalia scattered all over the walls in the most depressingly dead shopping complex I have ever seen. I'm talking closed store after closed store after closed store. Thankfully, the depressing exterior dissipates the second you walk in. The entire staff is laughing, joking around, coming over to the tables and sharing their war stories from the night before, friendly as all hell and straight up hilarity.  The prices were retarded cheap. My entire breakfast, which consisted of eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast was $3.99. Three freakin dollars and 99 cents!! Cheaper than Denny's/IHOP and other look alikes...oh, and I could order a big fat cocktail with it. Not beer, not wine, liquor baby. WIN!!!  Upon further examination, I saw that they had insane specials like my breakfast going on every single day/night of the week. Like Thursday night Ladies Night which consists of $1 you call-its for the ladies. Be honest, how long has it been since you've heard of a bar doing dollar you call-its?? A long ass time, that's for sure. But that's not where it ends. I want to say Monday night was some crazy thing like $3.99 all you can eat pasta and Wednesday nights were $7.99 half rack of ribs night or something ludicrous like that.  The best part of this all, even better than the rock bottom food and drink prices, was that the food was actually pretty darn tasty and the drinks were poured STRONG! The owner Gino came over and hung out and shot the shit with us for a while during our brunch, telling us about a couple parties he's hosted there, including NYE where he provided transportation to and from the bar for every single patron, regardless of where they live and completely free of charge. How's that for some old-fashioned hospitality?   I am calling it now. This is my new Cheers. This bar/restaurant embodies everything I feel like most places I frequent lack. Good people, good food, good drinks all at a price I can actually afford?? I always thought places like this were just rumor and too good to be true, but Gino's, you've made a believer out of me.

Go to the Vig Uptown for the bathrooms alone. Seriously. If you are one of those neurotic people out there like myself who judges establishments and the frequency of which you will attend them by the cleanliness among other features of their bathrooms, then I am thrilled to say you will not be disappointed. The stalls are gigantic, completely separated from top to bottom so you have full privacy and don't have to stare at people's disgusting dirty feet, and best of all, they have a little ledge for your cocktails! Why more places don't consider that sometimes we like to take our drinks to the bathroom with us is beyond me, but it creates a real predicament once you walk into a stall and there's nowhere to put it. Oh, and if I ever become rich I am ripping all of the sinks out of the bathrooms in my condo and replacing them with whoever's sinks are in the Vig. In a word, GORGEOUS!  The second thing that makes the new Vig a winner is the Kid's Menu portion of Mac n Cheese. It is so freaking delicious I have no words. Almost tastes like fresh pasta smothered in Velveeta. Plus it costs like $5, possibly $6, whatever, I've never once been able to finish it.  Drinks are a little pricey for me to spend as much time as I'd like here, especially with regard to their gorgeous bathrooms, but still affordable enough that I'll come party here once or twice a month.  Go check it out for yourself, just watch out for their Sunday Brunch if you're not into babies...because they're everywhere!

Expect to find me here every single Sunday during football season. Think Fox Sports Grill with slightly inferior (although cheaper) food but way better TVs and seating options. And don't get me wrong, the food's not bad, it's just one of those places with a GIANT menu so I haven't stumbled upon what they do really, really well yet, although I'm certain I will.  Anyhoo, pretty standard drink prices, Bud Light drafts were $3.25 and my Greyhound was $5. And as Geoff L. mentioned before me, you can get a variety of giant steaks for under $20, which is insane.  The newest thing that secured my patronage to Wolfley's in addition to the million and a half high def TVs and the lovely hostesses who seat you according to your team allegiance for your viewing pleasure, is the NON-SMOKING PATIO!!! I mean, there is nothing that drives me more insane than living in Phoenix and wanting to enjoy this incredibly gorgeous weather we're having only for it to be RUINED by plumes of cigarette smoke being blown in my face. Not in Wolfley's thought! All outdoor seating is non-smoking and smokers actually have to leave the confines of the property to indulge, which I'm sorry to any smokers but KICKS ASS!  So yeah, Wolfley's now has my heart on Sundays. And I will continue my quest to find the perfect menu item that pushes them to 5 stars!

A trendy looking bar...in the airport, hmmm. Wait, in the Phoenix airport?!? No way, impossible, not a chance. These were all the things I assumed before I actually arrived at Barfly before my flight to Mexico a few weeks ago, and I could not have been more wrong.  I wish I was there longer and actually had a chance to sample some of their offered dishes, which honest to god sounded pretty decent. It's still the airport so plan on paying the awesome prices of $10 a beer etc but at least you can spend your pre-flight time drinking on a cozy leather couch watching tube rather than the alternative Fox Sports bar in every other terminal.

First yelp review in almost a year and Ann is the only one who could get me to do it. This is the ONLY place in town to get a spray tan, simple as that. Say good bye to streaks, orange coloration and gross after-tan residue, Ann does not let that shit fly in her shop!  She personally mixes every formula together prior to your airbrush session where there are fun little upgrades you can select to be added to your solution if you desire like slimming drops and quick dry formula (my personal fave) to name a few. She does every tan herself and is extremely thorough, even using a paint roller on you to get rid of any excess or buildup! Oh, and if you're lucky, she'll even send you a follow up text to make sure you're happy with the turnout. She's literally like the doctor of airbrush tanning.  I've always been beyond happy with my tans at Phoenix Glow, but that's not where it ends. Let's say you show up to tan in a business suit and you completely forgot to bring any loose fitting/dark clothes to wear home and are not thrilled with the idea of getting spray tan solution on your fancy suit. You have to go home to get a change of clothes, right? WRONG! Ann has a rack of loose fitting, inexpensive sun dresses for purchase for this situation precisely that also double nicely for a day at the pool/beach. Forgot flip flops? No sweat! You can buy those there too. Ann has a great gift for anticipating the needs of her customers and it shows. I was on my way to a Halloween party at Amber W.'s a few months back and realized I forgot to buy fake eyelashes for my costume. Who came to the rescue you ask? Ann from Phoenix Glow did, again.  I cannot say enough good things about this girl and this shop. The results are fantastic, there is always a multitude of specials running (I'm not sure I've ever paid full price for a tan once, thanks Ann!) and her schedule is more than accommodating. Extra bonus points for Yelp Check-In Specials too!  If you're looking for a gorgeous spray tan in the Central Phoenix area, look no further than Phoenix Glow, you will be more than satisfied. I certainly am.

Went back and saw Ann last night for the first time in over a year and she somehow managed to give me the PERFECT SPRAY TAN. I didn't think it was possible, there's always one tiny little thing you wish you could change, maybe some lotion got on your hands, your heels etc, but no, not this time.   I am standing here staring at myself in the mirror admiring the work of the goddess Ann, once again. The colors are so natural looking and the care she gives to each one of her clients is incredible. I couldn't make any of the appointments available work for my schedule so of course Ann offers to stay late to accommodate.  She is the best, her work is the best, you walk out of there feeling and looking like a million bucks. Best spray tan in Phoenix, case closed.

Okay, I haven't written a Yelp review in an inexcusably long period of time, but the experience I had with Pat Davis of Cat Groomer 602 inspired me. I have what you could describe as a somewhat difficult cat. She is a ball of fun and wonder 99% of the time, except for the 1% of the time I make her do something she doesn't want to, like ride in the car, clip her nails, make her be nice to strangers etc. Usually grooming for my cat isn't even an option because it involves waaaay too many of the things that she doesn't like, and my poor baby is traumatized for days afterwards.  Until I met Pat that is. I came across Pat's business Cat Groomer 602 on Yelp actually when I was looking for a new groomer as I have a house guest coming in to town who is not pro-cat, we'll say and I wanted to minimize the unpleasantries for her. Pat is different from every other mobile grooming service because Pat comes INTO YOUR HOUSE to do the grooming. Gone are the days when you even have to drag your cat kicking and screaming down the stairs and out to the van to be groomed. She sets up shop in one of your bathrooms, and in about an hour, your cat is gleaming, soft, smelling amazing and most importantly loose hair free. Pat used all top of the line Furminator products and even brought my cat a little blinged out necklace with her initial on it. Totally above and beyond the call of duty.  And last but not least, my cat by some miracle, did not hate Pat. My cat hates just about everyone that isn't me. Let alone someone hosing her down with solution and water? Un-freaking heard of. Her manor is amazing. She did the majority of the grooming with my cat in her lap for crying out loud. She loves cats, has over 30 years of experience, and I could not recommend her any more. If you have a cat who hates to be groomed, do yourself a favor and give Pat a call. She will make it SO much easier than you ever dreamed possible.

First of all, any place that sells Cherry Coke out of the fountain gets an automatic 4 stars from me at the very least. I don't care if you don't like it, that's just how it is.  I was really nervous about going to this place after the Smashburger disaster. The Smashburger disaster of course was when me and the rest of Tempe getting super excited that a supposedly legit burger place was coming to downtown Tempe, then I got there, and it was horrific. A patty and bun essentially served in a pool of grease, horribly over-seasoned fries, and a stomach ache that ruined my afternoon.  Needless to say, I was a little hesitant to get my hopes up for a new over-hyped burger chain near my office.  That said, I was actually pleasantly surprised with Five Guys when I went there for lunch today. Yes, like a moron, I went there on their very first day open, always a dangerous move mind you, so of course it was slammed. However, the place was very well staffed and they handled the crowd no problem.  Basically the deal is you get hamburgers, cheeseburgers, or bacon burgers, one or two patties, and a large selection of toppings, all which are free of charge. You also can either get Regular Fries or Cajun Style Fries.  The burger was juicy and flavorful. The Cherry Coke was as magical as you'd imagine, and the Cajun fries honestly kind of sucked. No real flavor to them and they were a little limp but boy did they give you a ton of them.  Luckily for them, I was still mesmerized by that heavenly Cherry Coke, but I digress...  Five Guys is by no means gourmet or fine-dining, but it is a very welcome addition to my DT Tempe lunching routine.

It makes perfect sense that my 100th review goes to TenPoint5, as it is my new obsession. I couldn't imagine sharing this milestone with anyone else!   Okay, let's start with a little backstory. I have been trying to get back into fighting shape for around a year now. Before TenPoint5, I tried running, Jillian Michael's Body Revolution and other various cardio methods. I learned I was the world's worst runner with the world's tiniest lungs, and all Jillian Michael's did for me was pack on a bunch of bulky muscle that was not cute. It also busted up my knees, feet and ankles with all of the jumping. Nothing actually burned the fat off my body that I was looking to do.  I had done barre classes a hundred years ago with Amber W. and we both loved them so I figured what the hell, we'll try this one again. Barre is a zero impact exercise that centers around teeny tiny movements intended to isolate and workout your muscles. Each class begins with a weight series for your arms, then moves into a section for thighs followed by glutes and then finally abs. There is intermittent stretching between each section. As I'm sure every other review says, the instructors are fantastic. They are super helpful without making you feel like an idiot, they push you to places you didn't know your body could go to and they encourage you to "Go Beyond" throughout class. And the loud pop music playing throughout is a welcome distraction! Full disclosure, it took me a solid 3 months before I felt like I could actually make it through an entire class respectably. This shit is HARD.   I finally get to a point where I feel comfortable with my performance, my muscles are starting to get long and lean as promised, and I've built up a nice juicy booty I've never before had in my life. And then they release Biker Barre to knock me on my ass once more. I have never both loved and hated something equally as I do with Biker Barre. Half the class is traditional barre and half the class is spin. It is brutally challenging and freaking amazing. I was pleased with the way my body was changing before and Biker Barre has seriously ramped up my results. That added kick of cardio in addition to barre is doing work on my body and I couldn't be happier.  I feel so fortunate to have found the fabulousness that is TenPoint5. Sarah, Christa, Bebo, Priscilla, Ashley and JoAnne bring the heat every single class. If you're looking for that long, lean, toned physique, look no further. You've found it at TenPoint5!
