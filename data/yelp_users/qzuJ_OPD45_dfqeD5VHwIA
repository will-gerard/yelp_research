Way over price for the entree. Too much msg ! Got so thirsty afterwards. Sad that we don't have a decent pho places in the north Scottsdale area.

Been there a few times .. It used to be better. Food was cold when we got home. We only lived 3 mins away from there. And of course they missed my soup .. Hopefully they will get back again

So happy to find a place like this by my house ! And this is best place to be for your eyelashes I promise ;) Been getting so many compliments on my volume lashes ! And their prices are very reasonable and affordable compare to a lot of places !!( trust me I know) the best part is they do stay for a while and still look great ! :D

Been going back for last 3 months ! Still very satisfied with my lashes and feeling gorgeous everyday ;) Megan & Alesha both are amazing !! Would love to try all the other girls in the near future ! And they are very honesty with their time and will never charge you extra!! Always a happy girl when I'm there!

We went there on Sat night around 11 pm, there was a good crowd , decided to stay ! Went inside and sat at a bar , the bartender told us he is closing .. Okay? ( sat night 11 pm on mill ) that's okay , so we moved to the other bar which seemed pretty busy , sat at a table , while there were still a group of people drinking and hanging out .. But when every time we tried to get the server attention , she literally just ignored and walked by us couple of times ... And if wasn't even midnight yet ...We just gave up and left. Pretty disappointed on the first visit , didn't try anything at all. Not sure will we ever go back. Yet it's a very nice , spacey , indoor and outdoor brewery !
