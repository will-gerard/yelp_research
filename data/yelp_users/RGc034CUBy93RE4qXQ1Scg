This place is a diner, and if you're expecting anything else you'll be disappointed.  But for a diner the food is fantastic!  I had the eggs and bacon with an english muffin. I ordered my eggs over very easy and they came out perfect.  The bacon was thick cut deliciousness.  My dad's girlfriend had the french toast and it looked amazing.  My dad had pancakes and let me try a bite - fluffy wonderfulness, in my opinion.  The orange juice is from concentrate, but again...it's a diner.  Please expect a diner and review as such.  Oh yeah....the price is right too.  About $25 for breakfast for three!

I LOVE the Giants, and I LOVE coming to Scottsdale for spring training.  In fact, I really love coming the week before spring training games start going to batting practice.  You get to see the players practicing in a pretty casual setting, and they sign autographs afterward which is fun.

Yuck.  I only went here because my manager was in town with me and says that he always goes here when he's in Scottsdale.  I'm honestly not sure why.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had enchiladas which were dry and gross, and no one else seemed to like their meals - except my manager who had tacos.  Maybe that is the thing to get?  I did really enjoy my margaritas (I may or may not have had almost a whole pitcher all by myself), but that was about it.

The surly older waitress was a huge bummer.  I realize we weren't all arriving at the same time or leaving at the same time, but we were drinking cocktails in the middle of the day on a week day.  Wouldn't most waitresses see that as a great way to get a bigger tip?  Come by more often, bring more expensive alcoholic drinks, offer to take food orders every now and then to keep us there and drinking longer, and for GODS sake, pretend to be nice.  Seriously - she was awful.  It was clear that she couldn't have cared less that we were there.  And the food was sub par.  My turkey club was a wrap with some turkey, bacon, and lettuce in it.  The cheese was melted on top to make it look like it was a burrito, and there was some canned salsa on the side, for about $11.  No fries or chips or fruit....really?  Some of the reviews make it sound like the dive bar to go to at night....I love dive bars so maybe I'd try it again, but that's a big maybe.

So, I'll first admit that I didn't actually purchase a tire here, but I found the customer service to be top notch, regardless.  I went in because I needed a place to leave my car for a few hours while I went to the Glendale Stadium for the Fiesta Bowl (I met some friends in the parking lot and we carpooled over).  The guys working at McFall assured me that I could safely leave my car there - just make sure it was locked.  I left and was in the middle of the tailgater when I realized that I could not remember locking the car after getting stuff out of my trunk.  My laptop and purse were in the trunk and I immediately started freaking out.  I called McFall and they were SO cool - the agreed to go out and check on my car and make sure the doors were locked.  So look.....maybe I didn't get tires there, but honestly, don't you trust a business that is good to you regardless of money spent there even more than a business where you're spending tons of money?  Thank you Mcfall!  I promised a great review - sorry it took me four months!

So this is a complete and total dive.  The whole operation from the casino to the restaurant(s).  And it's WONDERFUL.  The Prime rib was great, but my husband had a hamburger that apparently had bacon ground into it - it was unbelievable.  It's super cheap, and I think that 4 adults and 2 kids ate (and drank) for about $120 total.

I love baseball.  And I love visiting baseball stadiums.  This is the worst baseball stadium I've ever visited.  It was a beautiful 85 degree day today and they had the roof closed.  Is feels like a giant airplane hanger.  So.  Boring.

While in Las Vegas for business my colleague and I decided that we'd use our company food reimbursement solely on our dinner (breakfast and lunch were being provided so this left a good amount of money).  We searched on Yelp and found Bouchon - and how can you go wrong with anything Thomas Keller?  In San Francisco we can't get foie gras and I hadn't ever tried it before but was excited to - it was absolutely delicious!  We also shared the gnocchi (which is pasta rather than potato) and the beef short ribs - both were spectacular.  I had a glass of red wine which was delicious even though it was one of the less expensive choices - I especially enjoy when a restaurant will serve good wines that are less costly.  I would definitely go back again.

A co-worker and I went here the other night for a quick dinner after standing in our booth all day at a show.  We were pretty hungry and excited for some good sushi after several really amazing (but heavy) meals in Las Vegas up to this point.  Honestly, this was the worst sushi either of us have ever had, and it was made worse by the exorbitant prices.  The Unagi was dry and cold, and tasted like cardboard - it didn't even look appetizing.  We had two other sushi rolls that were okay, but not worth nealy $20 each. We did also order cevice which was quite delicious, but it didn't come with any wonton chips or anything, and that's strange for ceviche.  My colleague ordered a beer and the waitress brought the wrong one - she was pretty pissy when he sent it back, and it was difficult to get her attention after that.  I had the cocktail with a floating orchid in it - it was fine but nothing amazing.  Overall, especially given the price ($120 for an app, 2 rolls, Unagi and 2 drinks) this meal was overwhelmingly disappointing.  We overhead the waitress saying that they were closing, and I can only say good riddance.

Sooooooo yummy!  The fish is fresh and tender, and the rolls are pretty creative.  The staff are welcoming and friendly and the price is right.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  I'm used to sushi in San Francisco, which is a city knows for sushi, and Yasu is right up there in quality to any of the many great sushi restaurants I've been to here.  I would definitely go back when I'm in town again.

My parents brought me here when I was visiting them in Mesa.  It was great!  It's not a hole in the wall burrito shop (which would be my preference), but it was really tasty, and the service was fantastic!  I loved this place, and would definitely go back when I'm in the area.  The enchiladas were phenomenal!

I've been here a couple of times and I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  There is outdoor seating at the outdoor bar (two things I absolutely love), but unfortunately there is smoking out there.  That's the only thing I didn't love.  They give you bread with an aMAZing oil and vinegar with herbs in it before dinner.  SOOOOO yummy.  I've tried a couple of different things on the menu and the food has always been good.

Yummy bloody mary's, lots of tvs to watch sports, and waitresses for the boys to stare at, if you get my drift.  The food is decent but not amazing, and the space is big.  I'd go here again the next time i'm in town, but probably only to watch a game and have drinks.

After walking around on Mill for a bit on New Years Eve we headed back to our hotel for some drinks in our room (the college scene wasn't really what we were looking for that night).  We happened to walk past the Baer's Den, and it was exactly what we were seeking!  We sat outside and they turned a heat lamp on for us.  Drinks were cheap, and though they started out weak we asked for them a little stiffer and they accommodated.

The ribs are A-mazing, and the sauce is very good.  Skip the chicken - it's always dried out.  The fries are hand cut and delicious too though, and everyone there is very friendly.

One of my clients uses this business as their tech support.  I was calling in to get synced with my client's management system, and the owner (I think his name was Jay but I'm sooooo bad with names sometimes) was on the call with us.  He was aMAZing.  Not only was he helpful in getting me on the main server computer, but when our mutual client had questions about what was happening, he was like a consultant/therapist.  Seriously - he was incredible.   I would highly recommend these guys!

This is one of the most beautiful resorts I have ever stayed at.  It's far nicer and more modern that the run-down-feeling Phoenician, which I unfortunately stayed at the next time I was in Scottsdale.  My room overlooked the pool and Camelback mountain.  I was able to sit outside on my private patio and watch the moon rise over the mountain at night - it was truly spectacular.  I worked out at the gym a couple of times as well, and because I got there at 5am I was able to see the sun rise similarly - it's gorgeous.  I think it's probably one of the most spectacular sunrises I've ever seen (and doing a lot of backpacking, I've seen some pretty amazing sunrises).   I ate at the bar once and LOVED the cobb salad.  We also had drinks at the restaurant bar one evening, and they were delicious.  The pool is a bit of a party mixed with families.  It's a fun atmosphere.  Splurge and stay here sometime.   You won't regret it!

This review is overdue!  I'm sad to say that I don't remember the name of my server, but she was SO NICE.  I stopped by for lunch during a business trip, and I had some time to kill.  I ordered my lunch and a water with lemon.  The waitress was great about refilling my water and "making sure that I would stay hydrated".  It was really wonderful, and made me feel taken care of - kind of like a kid, but not in a childish way.  In a "I just care" kind of way.  She even prepared me a plastic to go cup of water with a lemon in it, and I refilled it all day long.  I've actually been here twice (once for dinner and once for lunch). Everything is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, thoughtful, and fresh.  The margaritas are fantastic, and the guacamole is delicious.  I highly recommend coming here, even if you are not staying at the Camelback.

This is a really cute little salon in the Dana Park area (I think that is what it's called).  They have a lot of fun product and the place is clean and tidy.

Just paid $9 for a Chipotle Grilled Chicken Salad and there was no chicken on it. Annoying.  It's basically a kiosk, so by the time I realized it I was already at my gate.

YUMMMMM!  I had dinner here the other day, and have to say that everything was fantastic.  The spicy crunch roll is unbelievable, and the half rainbow/half dragon was perfect.  I also ordered the salmon nigiri,  which was delicious but overkill as I was eating alone.  I'm embarrassed to admit that I also had edamame, which was salted with is always a plus in my book.  The fish was all tender and very fresh, and the customer service was fantastic!

I was in town for business and we were working really long days.  On Friday we were able to get tickets to the 8pm show, and I'm SO glad we did!  It's truly a delightful show - raunchy but super fun.  If you're easily offended you may want to think twice, but it really was quite funny and the acrobatics are amazing!

I was staying at the Saguaro and they gave me a card for a free guacamole and chips, so of course I had to head down!  I also ordered the fish tacos, and both were amazing.  To wash it all down I I ordered a pink drink that someone next to me had and looked good.  For the life of me I cannot remember what the name of it was, but it was some sort of pink margarita.  Also VERY delicious.  The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because I ordered the taco from the bar menu and it was only supposed to be one taco for $4, but when it came it was three tacos, which cost $11.  Since I was alone it was a bummer because who can eat a whole bowl of guac AND three tacos?  Okay....I can.  But I didn't want to.  In any case, everything was quite delicious and I will definitely be back!

I had a chopped salad, and it was one of the best salads I've every had - inside OR outside of an airport.  A wonderful surprise, and since I travel through PHX often I was excited to find this little gem!

I'm not sure why there are not reviews for Centro yet, but I loved this bar/restaurant!  I went during the NBA finals because I happened to be staying at the Monte Lucia, and it was a really fun atmosphere.  It's a really big, open space with plenty of seating and several TVs to watch the game(s) on.  I had the cobb salad which was quite good, and they have great beers on tap.
