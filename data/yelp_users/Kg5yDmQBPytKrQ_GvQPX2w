Very helpful!  The owner is really nice and very caring.  Helped us turn our green pool to crystal blue and the prices are GREAT!  We have been coming here for over a year! Leslie's is to expensive and I like to support the family owned small businesses

They LIE in the ad they send out in the mail...5 rooms for $40.00 LIE!!! LIE!! LIE!! They showed up and wanted to charge $350.00  When we said NO they charged us $15.00 cancel fee  I knew they would try to up sale and I was willing but not to $350.00???  CRAZY...DON'T buy into the BS  the flyer in the mail packs that go to every mail box......There's is a SCAM!!!  There is plenty of competition out there and great carpet cleaners ...stay clear of this ONE!!!
