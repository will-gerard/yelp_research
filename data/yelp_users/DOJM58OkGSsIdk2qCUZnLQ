We were in Phoenix for the ComicCon and I took my daughter over for lunch, because I didn't want Subway or Burger King again. Just a little place right off the light rail at 3rd and Jefferson. She had a hot dog and I had a garden burger. Then we split an apple cobbler for dessert. The service was fast (even with all the geeks there for lunch), and they were super sweet and friendly. I'll have to come back and try some of their other dishes, but the hot dog and burger were a bit above average fare. You also get steak fries with the meal. The cobbler was excellent.  They had peach and pear as well so I'll definitely be back! The light rail makes getting to these places from the east valley so easy now!

If you want spicy, this is where you need to be! The food was excellent, service was also very good. I had the Shrimp Balti with rice, and the chicken with mint sauce. Just all around yummy- and I will be back to try more things!  I was fine with the spice level, but if you aren't a fan of spice then even the milder dishes might be too much.

The food here is pretty amazing. The service, not so much, is very slow. I might not go here for lunch anymore unless it was take out. But the food alone keeps me a fan! Then you can stock up on whatever Mediterranean items you need in the attached market!

Great store for finding specialty items. They also have the cheapest prices I've seen for the energy bars I like. The only thing I wish they had more of is non-foods. Not a huge selection of soaps, shampoos, etc. Still have to go elsewhere for those. As with most specialty stores they are on the pricey side (other than the energy bars!), so I certainly can't do all my regular shopping there.

Been here twice in the past couple of weeks now- one for a friend's 31st birthday party and also for my daughter's school fundraiser. The fundraisers are always popular and fun- the kids love to see each other outside of school. It's a cheap way to kill a couple of hours. The birthday party was a private one. Adults only with alcohol. It was a blast- having the rink to yourself and no kids was probably the best time I've ever had at a skating rink. Yeah, it's not the cleanest place, and yeah the food is a step below movie food, but you can overlook that and still have a good time.  It's one of the cheaper entertainments in the valley, and it won't be my last time there. It's like a dive-bar skating rink!

One of the great things about living near farmland is... farmer's markets! Of course it's a little tricky to do here in the heat of the summer, but the Power Road market manages to stay stocked year around with produce that is fresh and for the most part local. It's a small Mom-n-Pop market, but they work with local retailers around the valley to bring in all sorts of different foods that go way beyond produce. They also roast fresh chilies daily, & sell locally made tamales and salsa too.   The prices are what really get me. So many complain about the jacked-up prices of farmer's markets, but this place has always been either the same in price, or I pay even less. Plus, because most of it is local, the food lasts longer!   If you're in the east valley, they are worth checking out and changing where you buy your produce. Buy local whenever you can!

Was there for my birthday yesterday, but it's not the first time I had been there. The service was excellent this evening, but I think that was because we got there at 5:30, just before the dinner rush hit. Our meals were brought to us in a very timely manner, and they even accommodated a picky child. I'm not sure why it says it's not good for kids, as the place was full of them and they have a kids menu.   The servings are always way more than you need. I had the Cobb Salad and brought most of it home. Had the calamari as an appetizer and absolutely loved it. And of course I needed a piece of vanilla bean cheesecake, after all it was my birthday. :-)  I definitely recommend going but try to plan a down time or just before or after a normal lunch or dinner rush.

I've been here before and just had an appetizer (which was great), so it was nice to come back and check out their actual meals. First off- if you're limited on time, you probably should plan accordingly. I've been there on a Thursday and Friday night, and it doesn't matter. It's just busy all the time. Because it's so busy, it's loud. Can't really hear yourselves talking, so not recommended for intimate conversation.   But the FOOD- excellent. Had spinach enchiladas and it was top notch. It also helps that I'm a cheese-a-holic. If you like cheese you will not be disappointed. I have also never been much of a fan of Mexican rice, and I loved their rice. You get a ton of food for the prices, very worth it. Our server took great care of us when we told her we were in a bit of a rush. I will definitely eat here again, I think Nando's just replaced Serranos as our Mexican food place when all the back east friends and family come to visit.  Though I'm thinking take out, to avoid the crowd.

Who can say no to dipping things in cheese? Who can say no to dipping things in chocolate? I decided to have a small gathering for my birthday, and I have never been here before and have always wanted to try. I pretty much knew I was going to enjoy the food before setting foot in the restaurant (again, cheese and chocolate). It would have to be something pretty awful to make me dislike that. Since we were a big enough party, we could try two types of cheese, broth for the main entree, and chocolates. Our server helped us navigate the process well. I don't have a single complaint, other than I couldn't order a second entree on the endless fondue because I was already popping buttons on my pants. So. Much. Food. I also appreciated their selection of local brews, although I have a suggestion for them if they ever want to expand (Sonoran White Chocolate, anyone?)  Would I go again? Definitely. I wouldn't get the 4-course meal, that is really pricey. Probably just separate cheese and chocolate selections. A great place to splurge now and again.

I love these wings. LOVE THEM. Other locations are just not as good. My friend and I frequent this place way more than we should for lunch, usually after a workout so we can pretend to justify it. :-)  We're usually there between 11:30-12, and it's not extremely busy. The service has always been excellent. Actually, and I don't know if I should be ashamed to admit this, but the server now knows us. Today when we were there brought everything out for us. We didn't even have to order! I'm not sure how it is in the evenings, but if you want wings for lunch this is the place to go. You'll probably see us there- just look for the two in workout clothes!

We've been eating here pretty much since they opened, I can't believe it's taken me this long to Yelp about it. The food is always fast, fresh, and has good flavor. The prices are good, and they usually have a coupon of some kind on their website. Daughter loves the crab puffs. I love the Shrimp with Vegetables and the husband loves the House Chow Mein. For fast Chinese food that isn't Panda Express, go here. Just as fast, you'll spend just as much and you'll get better food.

Here's something weird if you want to stick to a suburban mom living in Gilbert stereotype- I can't justify spending more than $15 on a haircut. I've certainly gone that route, and you know what? $40 or $15, there is NO difference at all! To be fair, I do one cut, and then grow my hair out to donate to Locks Of Love, so I don't have a lot of upkeep on my 'do. Regardless, I still can't do it. I know a lot of people are weird about who touches their hair. They have a relationship with their stylist or whatever. Well, you can build a relationship and spend less here too. The whole family has been coming to this location for years, and the staff is always friendly, and they've always understood exactly what my children have wanted done with their hair. None of us have ever complained, and they take competitors coupons. Weekends tend to be busier, but if that's the case then you can become the stereotype and get yourself a Starbucks while you're waiting. ;-)

I was here for a volleyball game twice now, and the courts are great. Seating is up above the court so you can see all the action, and there are nice high ceilings for those occasional high hits. I haven't seen the rest of the place, but if you're going for volleyball and on the WAY North side of town, this is a great option. Free wifi too!

Having lived in the valley since I was 5, I grew up with trips to Milano Music. Rented my first viola there when I was in 4th grade, and my sheet music collection is entirely Milanos-made. You can get anything you need for whatever instrument you play right under one roof. The sheet music section is gigantic, and only once have I not found what I was looking for, and that was today. However a staff member asked how I was doing, and when I told her, she went to the back to look for the book. When she couldn't find it, she ordered it and got my name and number to call me when it arrived. I was completely taken care of.   Milano Music is what defines DT Mesa for me, even beyond the Arts Center and other big draws. I always ride a happy wave of nostalgia every time I visit, and am always looking for "excuses" to go back!

Saw the Chandler Symphony this afternoon, and before that I saw Rick Springfield about a year ago. I really enjoy this venue. Comfortable seating, and small enough where there are no bad seats. The acoustics on stage while listening to the symphony were wonderful. It's a beautiful building, and we will probably be back to see more of the symphony as well as The Nutcracker in December.

Was in Scottsdale for an event at SCPA, so we decided to have dinner at Blue Moose. The food was good, typical bar food, but the service was really lack luster. It wasn't even busy when we first arrived. Our waiter seemed to walk one table at a time, instead of doubling up to bring things out to people. Then after he brought the check, both me and my friend were able to go to the bathroom, and the check was still sitting there waiting for him when each of us returned. Eventually we had to walk up to the bar to pay, so we wouldn't be late for our show. Not the best of dining experiences. I'd probably go back though, I imagine it's one of the cheaper places to eat in the Civic Center area.

Went for the first time today with my sister for lunch. Small and quaint restaurant. Service was fast and efficient.   I had never had Ethiopian food before, and had been putting it off because honestly, it just didn't *sound* like something I would eat. boy I was wrong- it was very good! Flavorful, and just filling enough without making you feel stuffed. I wasn't sure how spicy it would be, so I ordered the mild beef. It wasn't spicy at all, so I know that next time (and yes, there will be a next time) I will be braver in my ordering. :-)

Ahhh... the water park of my youth. Who remembers sand entering the wave pool? You don't? Well, now you know how old I am! Took the family here last weekend. I love taking the kids and they always roll their eyes when I start reminiscing about the 80's. However, we still manage to have a great time. It is smaller than the other water parks in the valley, but that's ok. It's a nice set up. I highly recommend coming at the end of the season. It's not as busy, and the food is half price. Just a nice, relaxing day at the fake beach. With waterslides!

I've been on both sides, on the stage and in the audience at Gammage, and it's a top-notch facility to see just about anything. And after seeing "Hair" there on Tuesday (thanks so much Yelp!), I can honesty say I've seen just about everything in Gammage. :-)  The show (Hair) itself was ok. Enjoyable, but couldn't hear anything other than the music. Would have liked to know what they were singing. I hope they fixed that for the rest of the performances.

Living in the metro Phoenix area all my life, I grew up with Monti's. Had family in town who also grew up with Monti's so we went out for dinner tonight.  I wanted to remind them how great the bread is so they would move back. There were 12 of us total, and the service was a *bit* on the slow side, but I think our waiter handled it well considering there was another huge party going on tonight (85 people).   The bread is still great.  Had their Monday special which is the filet mignon. It tasted wonderful, but just a bit on the salty side. The side of steamed vegetables consisted of two pieces of broccoli and two small carrot strips, so they could definitely stand to not skimp so much on the veggies.   Mostly we enjoyed going for nostalgia's sake- childhood memories, growing up and remembering the treat it was to go there for dinner. Drink a sarsaparilla, which always comes in a bottle and a glass with two cherries to pour it in.  Bringing my kids now too, and they love it as much as I did- and do!

My 10 year old's description of the restaurant: "A maze of awesome." Definitely take some time to walk around, it's full of Tempe history. We were there last night for dinner. My sister who grew up on Monti's was in town, and it's just a requirement. :-) Food excellent as always. Our friend who was also with us had the fish and chips and said it was very good. The rest of us had prime rib and as always it was pretty much perfect. The service was prompt, and our bread basket was always full. I always feel sad when I see bad reviews, because I've never had any service problems when I've visited, busy or non-busy times.

Went there with some friends for lunch after a PodcampAZ meeting. Had the Crab Cake Chipotle Caesar Salad. It was pretty good, nice southwestern twist on the caesar. I'm sorry those other reviewers had such a bad experience. The waitress was friendly and even with 6 of us we weren't waiting too long for food or service at all. To be fair it wasn't very busy either at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday.   Had a good time, would go again.

Wow. Just, wow. I've never had Indian food make me say that. Granted, I've only had it one other time, and it was pretty good. But this? Wow.  It wasn't very busy when we arrived, so we were seated right away, and it really has the feel of a "Mom and Pop" restaurant. Very nice couple, and a comfortable laid back atmosphere. I'm glad I was with my sister because she knew more about the food than I do (but I'm learning!), and I decided on the curried shrimp, which came with rice and 4 different soups on the side. Sis gave me a bite of her Chicken Biryani, and that was pretty yummy too. SO MUCH FOOD! And it was all delish. I wanted to keep eating even though I was ready to burst. The price with the amount of food you get was surprising, I expected it to be much more than it was.  I can't wait to go back, and I would not complain at all making the drive from east Gilbert! Wow!

Had take-out from here tonight while visiting family in Tempe. It just wasn't anything to write home about. Not a whole lot of flavor in the Kung Po Shrimp (though the shrimp itself was pretty good), and the Hunan beef left a weird filmy taste on my tongue. No dish was less than $10 either- not worth it at all. It definitely didn't make me want to go back for the dine-in experience.

We were in town for a family wedding, so the kids were in tow. Since being on the strip wasn't our main goal, I was happy to be at a place that wasn't right in it. These are timeshares, but you don't have to go through the 90 min. sales pitch to stay there. The rooms are spacious, fitting our family of 4, as well as three others. The pool was wonderful, and the kids had a great time on the slides. I took advantage of the fitness center, which was small, but had top-notch equipment. Also- FREE WIFI. All over the resort. That's one big win in my book. There are grocery stores close by, and the outlet mall. If you have a car, it's very easy to get to the strip if you so choose. It really is as good as it gets for a place to stay in Vegas, if you find you need to go with kids. Without the kids would be good too, if being in the middle of the hustle and bustle isn't your main goal.

Stopped for lunch after getting into town. It's just off the Strip so you don't have to deal with a crowd of people. They brought bread to our table almost before we sat down. Everything was very fast service- wise. I had their Italian Cobb and it was a decent serving. My sister had chicken and said it was very tender. My mother loved the eggplant Parmesan as well.   Also had breakfast on the way out of town and it was the same great friendly service. Their bacon was the best bacon I have ever had. Who has ever said that about bacon of all foods?? Definitely will eat here every time I'm in Vegas.

This place still rocks. My brother and his wife had their wedding reception here. It was small and intimate, but the service was wonderful. We only had 3 choices for dinner, and when asked if there was another vegetarian option they added a vegetable lasagna with no questions asked. I had the meat lasagna and it was excellent. They all ready had a pianist there, and he was sure to dedicate a tune to the newlyweds so they could get their first dance in. It's really a great place to check out for any meal, and for any occasion too.

Not sure if you want Chinese or Mexican food? This place solves that problem. Love the Emerald Chicken and the jerk fried rice. The place is set up cafeteria-style - long tables and sit where you want. You can also get a sampling of many of their items and they explain what they are and how their ordering system works. It's not complicated, but it's helpful to know.

Was first introduced to Penzy's by my sister with Chip and Dip seasoning. Then some English Prime Rib Rub, Cayenne Pepper... and I'm definitely hooked! Recently bought some vegetable soup base, and I highly recommend it. We have a vegetarian in the house, so this really helps so we can all enjoy soups together. Very easy to find at Tempe Marketplace. On the pricey side, but worth every penny for such wonderful flavors!

New books, used books, and all kinds of extras to keep you in the store for HOURS. If you are tired of helping the big box bookstores make more money they really don't need, then you should start going to this independent, local bookstore instead.

Bread bowl soups (and salads!), unique sandwiches, and downtown Tempe- it just doesn't get any better! Love the brie and beef sandwich on wheat. And anything in a bread bowl works for me! The prices are reasonable for what you get- and that's a lot of food! I've been here several times now and I just love it. I've never been here on a weekend night though- so I can only imagine it's crazy.

The east valley really lacks in decent sushi. You have your chains, like RA and Kona, but you might as well buy pre-packaged sushi from the grocery store. So when my friend suggested going to Taiko, I was eager to try it out. Local Mom and Pop Japanese restaurant! I'm in!  It's a tiny place, and I was hoping it would be a bit busier for lunch, just because the rest of the shopping center is deserted for the most part. At least we could sit down right away and get started eating! All of their rolls are reasonably priced, as well as their lunch combos. I had the salmon teriyaki combo along with a spicy salmon roll. It was excellent- such a treat getting fresh food! The vegetable tempura wasn't overly greasy.The miso was a little on the salty side, but I can forgive since it was all so wonderful. Service was prompt (well it wasn't busy) and very friendly. She even gave the 4 of us separate checks, no questions asked! I will go here for sushi from now on.   They also have a sake tasting every month.... oh yeah, I'll be back.

Finally tried Taiko for dinner for daughter's birthday last week. I prefer lunch time, simply because it's not as busy! It was nice to know that they do get business though, considering the shopping center is pretty much deserted. Had to wait a little longer, but the food was just as good and worth it. My husband, who is not sushi fan, didn't really like the chicken teriyaki. It comes with a salad, and the dressing on the salad mixed with the teriyaki sauce, which made it taste rather bad to him. I would suggest asking for separate plates should you order it. Other than that, I definitely will be back, over and over again!

Living in the southeast valley, the light rail wasn't something I felt I needed to seek out and take. It was always just easier (and faster) to take my car, rather than drive out of the way simply to catch the rail. However, with a friend in town and needing to go into Tempe to pick up a packet for Pat's Run, I decided to give it a whirl. One ride totally changed my perspective. Driving out of the way to Dobson and Main is completely worth it. The ride from there to Tempe was quick, and the train is clean and air-conditioned. A great experience, and to not have the pressure of driving into Tempe, finding a place to park, wondering how much it will cost, etc. was great. We ended up taking it again the next day for Pat's Run. The next week I was in Tempe again for an event at Madcap Theatre and once again the rail was a great convenience. I didn't realize how much I missed DT Tempe until I was able to freely spend some time there again.   Now, when I know I need to head west for whatever reason, I am in the habit of checking the rail line and seeing where the stops are. Turns out the Girl Scout store (I'm a GS Leader) has a light rail stop just a few blocks away...   Naturally I would like the rail to be extended further east. For now however, if you're heading into Tempe or Phoenix and live in Gilbert or Queen Creek or anywhere more east than Mesa, it will save you fuel and stress to take the rail there vs. driving. Give it a try!

Oh wow- what a great place! You would miss it if you blinked, right between a PetCo and Fry's grocery. Small and cozy- we got there just before the dinner rush and thank goodness we did because it filled up fast.   Let's just get right to the food- awesome. The servings are pretty good size. I had Serjio's ravioli, which is a shrimp mixture. SO good. Kids loved the cheese and spinach ravioli, and husband loved the Gnocchi. Really good flavors. The service was also pretty decent. Great place, I would love to go back again! It's nice to find some great Italian food that isn't overpriced.

It's a shooting range, not too much to say about it. We've been here two years in a row now for daughter's archery tournaments. There would be no other reason that I come here.   I will say that if you're going to practice shooting anything, I would rather it be at a range than out in the desert or your backyard. Controlled environments- good!

They opened their bar to us all day for our KWSS pledge drive Friday. The place is huge! Lots of space for hanging out for an evening with your friends. Had one of their burgers for lunch- ironically enough it was also National Fast Food Day. Well cooked burger, but I think the fries were frozen from a bag. The service was excellent from Yvonne, and she took care of all of us ALL DAY LONG. Just wonderful. The owner is also a great guy. I'm not just saying this because they let us take over for the day. If I'm ever up in that area and need a place to grab a bite, I'm going to Stingers.

I knew I was in trouble when I was told I needed to dress up for our anniversary dinner. Hubby set up a wonderful surprise, which turned out excellent for both of us since neither of us had been to Donovan's before. It was obvious to me we have been married for 18 years, we both ordered the exact same meal- the filet mignon with shrimp scampi. Wow. Steak that melts in your mouth. Fresh veggies, and delish au gratin potatoes. I wanted to lick my plate clean, but figured in this upscale setting it probably wouldn't have been appropriate. Service was also excellent, we weren't kept waiting for anything. Great way to celebrate!

We went for the grand-opening at her new Gilbert location. This is the essence of casual dining- you walk in and you feel like you've entered someone's home. It's a sit wherever attitude, with a "hey how are you doing!" like you've known Tina and her staff for years.   The menu isn't huge so it's easy to decide what to have- and if you can't decide, get the combo platter so you can have a little of many things. Everything is also fresh. Tina came out and talked to everyone, and told us that she doesn't like to freeze her food, so you will have fresh ingredients each time you visit. It's also made to order, so don't be in a rush. It's completely worth the wait. Our drinks stayed full and the decor contains many conversation pieces.   The flavors in the beef and chicken were amazing, and the bread had an extra-sour taste to it which was an excellent compliment to the meal.   I will go visit Tina again very soon!  PS- They don't have a sign up yet, so for now if you look for the China Bistro sign that's where Tina's is. Go. Eat!

This was absolutely the best experience I have had at an urgent care, and I've been to urgent care many, many times with my kids over the past decade. My teen had a fight with a volleyball at her team practice Friday. The ball won. That evening she bruised around her eye, and the next day during practice she was pulled because she had a headache and was a bit dizzy. This was Saturday, and we took her to urgent care to make sure she didn't have a concussion. Turns out she did not, but the doc was concerned about a possible facial fracture so sent in paperwork for a CT scan.   Unfortunately this was over Labor Day weekend, so we had to wait until Tuesday. She explained what the bruising could mean, and also put her on an antibiotic and explained that if there is a fracture being so close to the sinuses there could be possibility of infection. I had no clue about any of this, so I as already grateful.   On Monday (the holiday) they called to check and see how my daughter was doing. Today we went and got the scan, and within an hour I received a call from urgent care letting me know there wasn't a fracture.   It was a great experience, and really appreciate how attentive and on top of things they seemed to be. It was better than my regular doctor.

Have to say for pizza, this was the best I've had other than actually being in NYC. Went last week for dinner. The restaurant is small, so it always seems to be packed and at least a 10 minute wait. We even got there later, like 7pm. Would have checked in through Yelp but there is no wifi. Service was a little slow, but it's a busy place. Worth the wait though, pizza was excellent. Best mozzarella I've ever had on pizza.

Always happy when a chain restaurant has decent food. First off I thought they might be closed because it was completely dead at the Arizona center. They were open, and yep we were seated right away. They cover the pickiest of eaters who might not want Greek food.  I had the gyro platter and was very impressed. Generous helping of meat, veggies and potatoes. Drinks came in what looked like a half-gallon glass. If the other locations are like this one I would definitely go again.

I love the homey feeling of this place- the burgers are great and have real flavor to them. I'm not a fan of the sweet potato fries simply because I don't like sweet potatoes, but I hear they are the best. I am a fan of the baked potato fries however- complete with bacon, sour cream and chives. SO awesome.   Breakfast is also a treat there- tastiest eggs in Arizona!

Another yummy dinner at The Grill! This time I didn't even have to wonder what to eat- I knew I wanted a burger. A burger I did have! Also split some onion rings with the daughter, which have a unique seasoning to them. YOU CAN'T STOP EATING THEM. The seasoning is a drug, I'm sure of it. Daughter is in love with the vanilla bean shake with malt, and her friend had the Pumpkin spice shake which she said was very tasty. It's a little overpriced (does it really have to cost $40 for three people to eat dinner at a grill? No, it doesn't.), but that makes it even more of a treat to go and get some food, since we don't go very often. :-) Today was also their 4th anniversary- so happy Anniversary to them! So glad they are in the area!

We had bought tickets the moment they were available to the midnight showing of New Moon, so it was a few months before the premiere this past weekend. We expected it to be busy, and planned accordingly.  Little did we know that a new promotion had come out just a couple of weeks before the premiere, where you could upgrade your ticket to see "Twilight" beforehand, then keep your seat for New Moon. This seemed extremely unfair to those of us who simply wanted to see New Moon, and not pay $5 more a ticket to sit through a movie we've seen before just to claim a seat. We soon heard buzzing from other people in line of their disgust, and after a complaint to the manager we were let in early without paying for the upgrade.  It didn't matter. We were in the third row, all the way on the side. The theatre was 95% full of people watching Twilight. It wouldn't have mattered if we had camped out 24 hours before the midnight showing, we still wouldn't have had a decent shot at a seat.  Very bad planning on the part of the theatre. This will guarantee that I never attempt a popular premiere at Harkins again. It was as if we were being punished for doing everything right, since we bought our tickets in plenty of time, and showed up hours before. You expect it to be busy, naturally. However everyone should have had an equal shot at getting a good seat. Bad move Harkins, bad move.

We had a brunch TechPhx meeting here, and Switch was suggested by a friend. The reviews were also encouraging. I was not disappointed! It's very hip and trendy inside, and unlike other wine bars I've been to (I'm looking at you Postino's in Gilbert), the music was loud, but not so loud I had to scream at everyone. It also wasn't as busy which could have also been a factor.   The food- pretty amazing. I had the breakfast Gallette, which was a pastry filled with bacon, cheese, and veggies topped with a fried egg. NOM. You get plenty of food for the price as well. I definitely would like to go back and explore more things on the menu!

Was here for EVFN/ #TechPhx kick-off party. I've never been before, but heard good things. I wasn't disappointed. They always get a room in the back for EVFN, and everyone was so nice, and prompt with taking orders and getting drinks to us. I only had wings, but they were quite good! They also have a good selection of drafts. Good place- I will definitely go back!

This was my first time to San Tan, joining up with the #evfn crew for their weekly meetup.   First off- the staff really helps make the experience perfect. They were prompt, friendly, and they kept track of everyone's order. And we had a LOT of separate orders between the 30 or so that showed up. AND the place was packed on top of it.    I didn't have a meal, but the pretzels were TO. DIE. FOR.  Also had their ale with the caramel in it (I can't remember what else- or the name). Also great- and went very well well with the Girl Scout cookies brought to share. Which the staff was also very cool about.   I want to go back and have an actual meal- because from the looks of all the food others were eating, it looked fantastic! But even without eating the food, go for the beer and the pretzels. It's completely worth it.

Was here for a Social Media Day happy hour, and it was pretty darn good. Sushi is fresh and flavorful, and their specialty drinks are excellent. I would like to come back for an actual meal. :)

Tonight I was hanging out in the Tapas bar for #evfn (east valley friday nights). This is not my first time, and every time I attend I wonder why I can't get there once a month for this great event. It is SO worth it! They have special offers for #evfn guests, and the food is amazing. You can pretty much get whatever you want from the many different "restaurants" inside the store. As well as the alcohol- just go grab a bottle of your favorite brew and they will serve it to you. As for the grocery store itself- well you can't get a better collection of specialty and organic foods. Now they just need to open a store out in the Gilbert area! Whole Foods are you reading? I want to give you more of my money, but you need to be closer!!

I had lunch here today. Took my Brownie troop for a private party/etiquette class. That was amazing in itself. for $14 a child you get drinks, sandwiches, a bowl of fruit (large bowl too!), and dessert.  The girls enjoyed the experience immensely. While the class/party was going on, my co-leader and I went out to the main area to eat.   Love the set up- very contemporary hence the "urban". Had the pomegranate tea, which was excellent. Also had the capriese , tomato, and basil w/balsamic vinegar sandwich. That was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.   The server was very helpful in choosing a tea to go with your meal, and had many suggestions. Was also very patient as I asked probably way too many questions about tea.   I've been talking this place up all afternoon now, and can't wait to return and try more of their food. Probably on "Soul Food Saturday"! Highly highly HIGHLY recommend!

Introduced another newbie to the Tea Loft. Still excellent! Tried a lemon/raspberry/basil ice tea- awesome.  If you like tea and want to try some new, creative and tasty infusions, then you need to go here. Now. Close the browser and go. Oh, and yes, even if you don't like tea there are other things to drink. The food is yummy too!

Again, wishing you could do a half-star, because I would give a 3 1/2. This was my first half-marathon ever, so I was crazy-excited and just wanted to get running so I might not have the most objective view. The course is really good, and has plenty of water stations. I did find myself thinking they needed more bands towards the end of the run rather than so many at the beginning. By 8 miles you could use the pick me up! Of course, I might have just been running slower at that point....   They ran out of toilet paper in the port-o-potties BEFORE the race- how awful is that?   Also didn't really like being forced to attend an expo just to pick up the racing packet. However, there were one or two booths of interest. You would also think for what we pay to run that there would be a few more freebees included. How about $10 or $15 off at any booth in the expo? I know, genius right?  Oh, and get a ride to the start line or take the light rail and walk the mile. Then use the light rail in Tempe- you don't want to try driving around either of those areas. It is NUTS.  Overall it was a pretty good event, I will do this again. Perhaps even a full marathon!

I've been here so many times, I can't believe I haven't reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friend's "go-to" breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if you're not in a hurry it's no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!

Was here a couple of weeks ago for a Gammage Goers event. Love this cute little place right on Mill Avenue! The bruschetta was tasty and a good price for the quantity! The service was really slow (we waited around 15 minutes for the check), I think because it was St. Patrick's Day she was a bit overwhelmed, but I definitely want to go back to try more items. Especially their Sangria. ;)

I went in for a simple knee brace, and came out with a whole lot more! I am not disappointed about this- I know their job is to sell. I really enjoyed getting the Shoe Dog analysis of my running. I've been running for three years now and over the past month is when the pain has really started. It was very interesting to see exactly how I land and push off, and I found out that less support wasn't really helping me- I needed more.   We must have tried out 5 different pairs of shoes- which was actually a good thing because Jodie (the salesperson who helped me) had put some Rock Tape on my knee so I could try it out. So I had about 5 minutes total of running on their treadmill to test it. Neat stuff.   So I ended up getting shoes, the insoles, tape, and also joined the VIP club so I saved about $40 on everything. It made the insoles cheaper. :) I've since tried out the shoes and the tape. I'm liking the shoes, but still wondering about the Rock Tape. We'll see. Overall I am happy with the service at Road Runner. If you are running for the long haul, it's worth it to become a VIP just for the 90 day shoe return policy. Just do your homework so you can tell if you're being fed a line to get the final sale or not.

I do love the food here, although it is extremely Americanized Sushi. That's to be expected, but this isn't why I gave it two stars. I went for dinner and I thought I had entered a club. The music was loud and thumping, and we literally had to yell to have a conversation. It was during happy hour so I'm not sure if that is why, but all the same it didn't help the experience. I don't mind loud music, but it definitely didn't feel appropriate in this restaurant. I guess I'd go back, but maybe I'll just take someone I don't really want to talk to. ;-)

Went for lunch, a small place but nice. Had the Red Curry Chicken. Was very yummy, just the right amount of spice without being too overpowering. Service was good too. If you're tired of all the bar food and sandwich shops in DT Chandler, this is a nice change once in awhile.

Good mall, I go here mostly when the kids "need" me to. It's a mall, so you know what you're going to get. Mostly we go to the movies. The outside thing is great in the fall. In the summer I have no desire to go there. They are also dog-friendly, which I guess is a plus if you really need to take your dog to the mall.

Went out for the weekly #evfn (East Valley Friday Nights). Had never been before, and really enjoyed the atmosphere! They handled our large group of 40+ very well, and still managed to keep the service prompt and pleasant. I didn't eat a meal, but did have their Southwestern Fries appetizer, which was basically nachos with french fries instead of chips. It was HEAVEN. I'd definitely go back and try a meal.

I love this place. It's a little piece of water space that makes me forget I'm in the desert for awhile- even with all the desert plants and trees! The observatory is nice, and we've even had a couple of birthday parties for my daughter there. A great multi-use space.

Went here the last time I was in Vegas, and it's a great place to go. Even better since we signed up for a Player's Club card, so we had free buffet tickets. Very good food and wide variety of selections. The Prime Rib and crab legs were especially good. I think that's what Vegas is all about- the food!

There for dinner tonight. I only had the salad bar, and to be honest that little sliver of salad bar is not worth $9. It's better to get it with a meal. At least it's fresh, and has fairly good variety. My sister had the salmon florentine and my aunt had steak- mooing rare. They both said they were very good. We'll definitely be back. I wouldn't mind trying a few of their cocktails too!

Went in for lunch during PodcampAZ. Good atmosphere, very breakfasty, which is what you would expect. I had a spinach/mushroom omelet, which was wonderful. I'm usually worried the eggs will be overcooked and dry, but it was pretty perfect. The potatoes were a bit undercooked. My sis-in-law had their pumpkin pancake, which was HUGE. She said it didn't have a lot of pumpkin flavor, but it was good. Nice brunch! I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a breakfast place that isn't Denny's or Village Inn.

This park makes me want to pack it all up and move to Tempe. It has it all, and hosts many major events because it has the space. And you are right there at the edge of DT Tempe. What more could you want? The lake is beautiful, walking next to it is beautiful. And now you can walk over the new pedestrian bridge too. Love this park!

My only experience with Brand X was PodcampAZ. They custom-made all the shirts right there on site. Love the type of shirt they used, and everyone is so nice!   Then tragedy struck- my logo started to curl up and come apart after only a couple of washes. I was heartbroken, and then Charles came to my rescue! He was as distraught over this as I was. Immediately he contacted me and sent me out another shirt, along with a return envelope so I could send the defective shirt back and he could find out what went wrong.   Charles, my knight in cotton-blend armor!   Hey, things like that happen. The important thing is when they occasionally do, the problem gets fixed immediately. It is also a plus that they are a local company. Easy to get to, easy to exchange and get even more shirts made! Even if it's just ONE shirt- and no waiting a week or longer to get it. You get it while you are standing there thinking about how awesome this company is.   I need more shirts, pronto.

Went for breakfast Saturday morning with some friends who were in town for our 20 year HS reunion. I had not been to this location yet, only the other two. I was not disappointed. I really don't think they know how to do a bad meal at this restaurant. I had a spinach mushroom omlette, and it was perfect. Service was attentive and fast as well, even with 6 of us. But then again we were all chatting and catching up, so it didn't matter all that much. :-) It also wasn't very busy when we were there at 8am.  Good morning and GREAT food.

If you need space for just about any event, this should be the first place you look into. Mostly it's a workspace, but my daughter's Girl Scout troop hosted a literacy/writing event in February, and it was a huge success! As long as you plan it well in advance, you can hold any meeting or gathering. They also host talks and workshops, and have Gangplank Jr. to get those kiddos interested in science and technology. Again- your first place to look when you need a space for an event, or just need to get some work done, is Gangplank. Go take a tour- because you can't truly grasp the awesome until you see it for yourself.

Now that it's been several months that I've been back, I feel I can give a review. I had stopped going for several years, and went to a couple of different gyms. What's funny if they were only willing to work with me, I'd still be giving my money to them. Now that I've been back at Freestone for a time, they could offer me half of what I'm paying here and I'd turn them down. Here's a list why:  1) Giving my money to the Town, not to a private business. 2) Updated, clean equipment. Not as big as major gyms, but this does not bother me. 3) Running track! Yes, it's 1/12 of a mile, but it's a indoor track so you don't have to be on the treadmill all the time. 4) Rock wall. Since my kids are too old for the child care now, they can do other things while I run and workout. Or they can run with me! There is also basketball, table tennis, racquetball, pool... unfortunately not a swim pool. That's not enough for me to take a star away. 5) Friendly atmosphere. The staff don't have a holier than thou attitude like other gyms. They will talk to you like you've known them for years.  6) They have recycling bins set up all over the place. People exercising use a lot of plastic bottles, ya know.  7) Payment options. You can pay for one day. Or a month, or 6, or even a year. YOU get to make the choice, there are no sales pitches.  I don't take classes, so I am not sure what their offerings are in that category. Overall, it's just a very comfortable place, with no pressure. You can go alone or make it a family day too. If you live in Gilbert, I highly HIGHLY recommend you take advantage of Freestone. You get your money's worth two-fold.

Had our monthly book club here. Was nice that we could make a reservation, but we probably didn't need it as it wasn't that busy on a Thursday night. Our server was good but seemed a little over-anxious to get our orders going. Portion sizes of salads are interesting. I had a seafood cobb, which was HUGE, and very tasty. Someone else ordered a dinner salad, which was still around the price of a full salad but she had about a third of what I did (and I could be generous in saying that- could have been a quarter size). I enjoyed the atmosphere very much, and wouldn't mind coming back and seeing what their other entrees are like. The pasta dish someone else ordered looked quite good. Yeah, I'll be back.

I love their hummus platter and their California Club pita! It's quite the hip place, and always busy. I'd rather do take out than stay in, because it's just busy and loud. And I"m a grumpy old lady. Busy means slower service too. But the food is good.

It's not awful, but nothing really wowed me about this place. The chips and salsa are good, and their white jalapeno sauce on my chimi was great. The drinks, although HUGE, were pretty watered down and not alot of kick to them. Probably not somewhere I would recommend to anyone for Mexican food.

Came out to support Amy Donohue who was part of a Comedy Show tonight. Had never heard of Doc's before, so as any good Yelper would do, I read the reviews. I was a little worried about how the service would be based on the reviews, but figured I'd keep an open mind and see what happened.   We got there as the doors opened at 7 and were seated right away. It's a beautiful place, very classy. Service was fast and our server was really nice. I wonder if the service was prompt because we were there so early? Who knows. What I do know is we got our drinks, appetizer and our meals in under 30 minutes. And they checked back often throughout the evening for drink refills.  The food was AMAZING. I had this huge baked potato smothered in creole sauce with prawns and roasted veggies. Hubby had chicken in pasta with the same sauce. I wanted to take home a gallon of this sauce so I can cook with it at home. SO good.  I'm not sure when we'll be back- it's quite a trek from Gilbert. It's also gets on the pricey side when you have a door fee and dinner on top of it. But to come out and support a friend it was totally worth it! If you're in the CenPho area I'd definitely recommend going and eating here once or twice. Did I mention the food is OMG SO GOOD?

Honestly, it's all pretty much hype. I like the NYC one, but there was at least an hour wait at this one, and we didn't have 3 hours to spend at an ice cream shop. So we got some things from the "take out" window. Which is ridiculously limited in choices. The ice cream itself is fine, but so is Dairy Queen. Definitely won't waste my time there if I'm ever back in Vegas.

Wow. I love this place. I want to eat here every day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, lather, rinse, repeat.  A group of 12 of us went here after a show at The Torch Theatre. It was almost 10pm, and we made a reservation. We had to wait a few minutes for everyone to arrive, but we were seated pretty quickly. Even with a big group and a busy time, the service was pretty good. I expected slower service, so color me impressed!  The food! Amaze-balls. Had a shrimp taco and quesadilla. If I were there for a normal meal time, I probably could have eaten more. The prices are inexpensive enough that you could order 2 or 3 tacos and still get a great deal. Their guac was also exceptional! I was really blown away, and I do not say that lightly. I really loved it!   They serve breakfast all day and night too- a couple friends had pancakes and said they were really good. So see, I have to go back. Hmm... maybe right now...

It's a great trail, but very popular so if you want solitude don't go on the weekend. Still better than the crowds at Camelback. A good workout, especially the last bit where it is the steepest. This time we went past the cave and a little more towards the summit. Had to do a little rock wall climbing at one point. One of the better trails in the valley.

I go here for the free wifi and the bleu cheese crumble salad. That's it. Bleu cheese, craisins, sunflower seeds all on a bed of romaine. LOVE IT. I don't think I've ever had anything else on the menu, now that I think about it. Free wifi will get me in every time, that's for sure! I chose this location because I was in Phoenix in-between activities, and didn't want to drive back to Gilbert. This was at the Biltmore, and yeah, you knew you were in a Paradise Bakery at the Biltmore. Kind of funny actually. What can I say? I like to people-watch. :-)

Went for a late dinner.  I've been a fan of this chain for years. I was surprised it was still so busy at almost 8pm (I know, 8pm isn't late, but it is when you're used to eating with your kids at 6) ! We were seated right away even though it was busy, but the service was a little on the slow side after that.  That usually doesn't bother me though, I see it's busy and we weren't in a hurry. We split one meal, and they were kind enough to bring it out on separate plates. LOVE the Chicken Bryan, it's the only thing I've ever had to eat there besides the Lobster Ravioli, which is also excellent.

To be fair I was recovering from an exhausting weekend full of bad food. I was tapped out. So eating fried chicken and waffles first thing in the morning was probably not my best move. The waffle was tasty. The chicken was greasy. The coffee was good. It wouldn't be my first recommendation for breakfast. It seems like one of those "either you like it or you don't" sort of things. I don't think I did. Would I try it again? If it were someone else's idea, probably.

Heard mostly good things about Lenscrafters, nothing overwhelming. So decided to give them a try. New store opened at San Tan mall so it was close and convenient.   The eye exam was fine, really like the Optometrist. The customer service on the store side, however, was not so great. They were courteous enough when we were choosing glasses.  However when we were checking out the computer wasn't accepting the information that was being put in.  The woman helping us said she didn't care if it took 20 minutes, she wasn't asking for help to get in their system.   We were hoping it didn't take 20 minutes. Eventually she figured it out.  The next thing that put us off was several days later, when we went back in briefly to have my glasses re-adjusted (they were a little tight). An employee took them, then said plainly, "just want you to know that if I break them, we're not responsible."  Um, what?   So, no, not the best of experiences for me and my husband. We won't go back, nor would we recommend them.

I've been working out here regularly for 6 or 7 months now, and although they do keep it VERY warm inside (you break a sweat before you even begin your workout), I do enjoy the place. Plenty of machines so you don't have to wait on anyone else, though they could use more hand weights. It's a no-frills gym. You go there to workout, and that is basically it. Not very strong in classes either.  The kids area says through age 12, but age-wise I think any child over 6 would be bored. The staff has always been nice and will say hello, and from what I've seen their personal trainers are excellent.  I've even found myself taking mental notes on new exercises to try.  All-in-all it's a good place to go in the Gilbert area if you're not interested in the whole "club" atmosphere.

I knew it was coming the day I saw a subscription notice on the TV. I was told today that they are shutting their doors. Luckily, Fitness Works is taking over all contracts, so we're not left stranded. I'm bummed, I really liked this gym. Fitness works is ok, but not nearly as personal as this one was. But that is for a future review. :-)  Rumor has it that the owner just took off, and it was suggested that members make sure they stop payments on their credit cards. Wouldn't want any double-dipping!

This will absolutely be the last time I review this place- promise! They are changing their name to "Spectrum Fitness", and this week is the week to sign your new contract. Meaning, whatever deal you had is null and void. Everyone has to pay $19.99 a month. No exceptions. Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.  I hate to do it, because I really do love this facility, but it's not worth paying the extra money when I can still pay what I always have at Fitness Works, who took over our contracts. It's just a little annoying that they would rather lose two people (they lost my training partner too) who wanted to stay, than work out some sort of deal. Oh well, their loss. We'll see how long they last, after all it's the third company to be in the space in I think as many years.

I'm spoiled by Harkins. With the cup deal, and the shirt deal for free popcorn, you only spend a dollar or two more per person than if you went to Picture Show. Plus I'm spoiled by good sound for my movies. If I miss a movie before it hits the discount theaters, It's almost worth it to wait for DVD, then watch it on my TV at home.

There really isn't a huge difference in any of the Harkins theaters. We go for the dollar drinks (with the cup) and the popcorn coupons (with the shirt)- it's worth the price each year if you go to a lot of movies. The only difference I can really see in this one is the employees are more pleasant than at other locations. I'm sure the child care place is also a great draw for parents of younger ones.

On a recommendation was here for lunch Friday afternoon and WOW. I've never had such a freshly made sandwich before from a shop. I had the vegetarian (#6), which was full of different veggies (sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, tomato, etc), on a whole grain bread that definitely tasted homemade. It was filling and excellent- and in no way am I a vegetarian! I'm also NOT a fan of mayo, but I even enjoyed the mayo on this sandwich. I will definitely be coming back to try their other creations, especially now that we have the convenience of the light rail to get us to Tempe!

The husband and I have been fans of chiropractic care for years. We've been seeing Dr. Wasserman for around 6 years now, maybe longer. She's compassionate and really knows how the spine and body work. I know there are many who still think chiropractic care is one of those "fake" medical things, but if I didn't feel better after an adjustment I wouldn't go. I had actually stopped going for about 5 years, and just recently went back due to tweaking my mid-back during a weekend of standing around at the Phoenix ComiCon. There is also a massage therapist on staff. If you're in the East Valley and are looking for a chiropractor, I definitely recommend Dr. Wasserman. She is also very affordable without insurance, and can work with you on payments.

Met the massage therapist this week. With all the half-marathon training I'm doing I just needed some extra work. She's very nice and knows her stuff. Also had some good recommendations on keeping yourself loose and flexible. Prices are fairly reasonable too. She's a bit soft so if you want her to really dig in and get those knots out, you have to tell her. She also has limited hours. Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 3:30-6:30.

Being an (inactive) musician myself, I have been looking forward to this place opening for MONTHS. So today we went. I was not disappointed at all. You get a headset as you enter, and when you walk up to each display it automatically begins to play what is on the TV screens that are with all of the instruments. This way you can hear what the instruments you're looking at sound like, and how they were used. I could have spent hours there. I know I didn't see everything, and not just because every display wasn't ready yet.    The highlight for me was seeing John Lennon's piano in which he wrote/sung "Imagine". There were many donated items by famous musicians, such as Eric Clapton, Paul Simon and The Black Eyed Peas. The highlight for the kids (and the husband) was the Experience Gallery, where you could actually play some of the instruments. They had a great time in there.   A museum hasn't moved me like this in quite a long time.  It's worth the drive no matter where in the valley you live. Also a must-see when you visit from out-of-state too. I can't wait to go back.

The theater is small, but the fun is huge! (see what I did there?)  I had the opportunity to be a part of The Neighborhood last night. I've known about the theatre for awhile now, but had never been to see a show.   They were great! I was quite impressed with how they took my silly stories and made them so much more exciting and hilarious than my actual life! The troupe works very well together. I did a lot of laughing. I definitely want to see more of their shows. It's different, and an inexpensive night out. They also have workshops, so if you ever want to try out improv, there are many opportunities available.   Torch Theatre could actually get me into Phoenix more! Who'd a-thunk it?

Went to a Local First Arizona mixer. It's a great space- lots of room and perfect for any sort of reception or party. Since I didn't organize the mixer I don't have much more to say, but if I were living up in that part of the valley it would be a place I would want to use!

Having just recently starting running, Pat's Run was something I had been wanting to do for a long time. Not so much for the run part, but to pay tribute to a great man, Pat Tillman. I got the whole family together and we hopped on the light rail on a very early Saturday morning to participate.  It's a fairly well-organized event. We had checked in early, so we just needed to meet up with our team and find the proper timing corral to wait in. This was the biggest outcome yet- around 28,000 people. It's a great run- if you're walking you probably get a more scenic tour or Tempe, but it's just beautiful. Even if you don't run or walk it, there are a million things to do- a fun morning for the whole family.  The only thing I really had a problem with was the parts of the route that bottle-necked and became too crowded. I think my time would have been a little better if I wasn't forced to slow down due to runner/walker traffic! Either way, it's a great day. My older daughter did the 4.2 run as well and just had a blast. She loved giving high-fives to the ASU football players. My younger daughter did the kids run after, and wants to participate in the longer run next year. I was happy to be a part of such a great event, and will continue to do so every year they hold it.

Second year participating- it definitely seemed a bit more organized than last year. I think they had to since they are getting record numbers. Loved the wristband idea for kids/parents. The shirts were better this year too, not see-through like last year. Still not a fan of certain parts of the course that are too narrow. 30k is a lot of people to get through a narrow residential section. Also loved the irony of the sponsors- a healthy family event sponsored by Chic-fil-A and McDonalds! All in all a fun morning and a great way to honor Tillman and raise money for a great foundation. This year the entire family ran the 4.2 mile course, as well as my sister and friend from MA and NY!

Another successful year! This was my 5th time running. As usual it is too big for such a small course, but I understand why they wouldn't want to cut it off at a smaller number. You definitely do not run this race to make a time goal, especially if you are a slower runner as I am. Good or bad, rain or shine, I will always participate in this run, because the cause it more important than anything.

I enjoyed this place very much. Had a great burger. We sat outside, and the only downside was the place next door started mowing their lawn at 7:30 pm, and it kicked up alot of dust. This was not the fault of the restaurant of course, and they took care of it very quickly for us too. I would like to go back and try some of their other food!

I know, I'm reviewing a Best Buy, but I have to share the great customer service we received today. Daughter had a gift card, wanted to buy game. She was so excited for this game, and began playing the moment we got home. Turns out she didn't like the game. I warned her she might not get her money back, since you can't really return them or even exchange them unless something is wrong. Well, since we went right back they were willing to exchange the game for another one. I was greatly relieved, no one wants to see my daughter angry.   I'm thinking a subscription to Gamefly is in order.

Wow- I'm pretty selective with a 5 star, so you know I mean it. This place was amazing. Pad Thai, Curry Salmon, a couple of tofu dishes that I can't remember now- but all SO GOOD. So much flavor in these dishes I even enjoyed the tofu, and I'm a carnivore who tends to avoid spongy substances. The flavor was that good!  I'm even giving this 5 stars with the slow service- it was THAT GOOD. We literally took the last two tables, and we were split up. However, they do take reservations, so live and learn. Call first. I can't wait to go here again, or even get take out.   So. Good.

I wish you could give half-stars. This would be a 4 1/2. Went the other day for lunch with my sister. It's beautiful- a converted spanish-style mansion, with a huge outdoor space. It was quite busy when we were there at 12:30, but the bar was empty so we decided to eat there. Service was on the slow side, beyond "oh it's busy today I'll cut them some slack", and that is the only reason I can't give this place 5 stars. I had the Local Mozzarella BLT, which comes with Sweet Potato crisps. Those are just peelings of fried sweet potato. Those are amazing, and I'm going to attempt them in my fryer at home. The sandwich was excellent. Just the right amount of basil flavor, and not too oily with the olive oil  and bacon. All of it was made with local ingredients too. That's how the entire restaurant is run.   I want to go back again, totally worth the drive from Gilbert. My sister all ready gave her name for Mother's Day so we could have a reservation to take our mother. Something tells me they fill up fast at this place!

These places are sprouting all over the valley! I am happy there is one closer, because these sandwiches are great! Last time I had the vegetarian, so this time I added some meat, with The Hunter. Roast beef and provolone on wheat. Yum! Definitely a good place to go when you're sick of Subway (and who doesn't get sick of Subway?).   My only negative is there isn't any wifi. That's really become important to me. I wanted to check in and let people know the great food I was having for lunch right then and there, rather than waiting.

I first went to the Market when they were beginning, and could definitely see potential. That was when it was two little rows of vendors. I just went this past Saturday and WOW- it has grown so much in two years! Tons of vendors, food trucks, music. It's more like a food festival with a farmers market included. It's the best farmer's market I've been to in a long time- and I don't say that lightly. I didn't expect to be wowed the way I was. If I could get my butt out of bed early enough and get moving I'd be there every Saturday! However, they also have the Power Ranch one on Wednesday evenings, so I guess I could check that out too. ;)

I've always had trouble figuring out my hair, especially since I stopped coloring. I'm mostly gray, so my hair has frizz issues and feels dry. Yvonne has an excellent intake form- she covers everything from your general lifestyle to exactly what you like and don't like about your hair. Then she sits and talks to you so she knows a little more about you. It helps her figure out a hair style that works for how you live. She also gave me many tips about taking care of gray hair and making it look and feel amazing. It was a great experience, and she has gained a new client because of how personal her service is.

Was here for Twestival Phoenix- what a great space! Lots of room, easy to maneuver through. Great bar area, and outside seating on the patio. Definitely a perfect place for an event such as Twestival.

Had our PodcampAZ pre-party here. A great space which can conform to whatever you might need it for. And you can work there for a nominal fee. I love the co-working concept, and hope it continues to spread throughout the valley.

When your kids have outgrown the inflatable bouncers, you go here. This place used to be a Bally's fitness center, so it's a huge space. So. Much. Fun. One side of the room was one long trampoline. Then on the other side you have the slam dunk trampoline, and the dodge ball section, and even a section for those younger than 8 who aren't ready to jump with the big kids/adults. Everyone who worked there seemed really nice, and also really watched the trampolines closely. They have a snack bar and serve Papa John's pizza, so it's not an unknown most likely frozen brand that a lot of these places serve. Tons of fun for the whole family. Oh, and you don't need kids to go and jump. Just go and jump.   Forget my kids having birthday parties here- I want all of MINE here from now on.

Was here for lunch yesterday, but not my first time. It was after the lunch rush, so easy to be taken care of. Had the lobster bisque and salad. Salad was great, the bisque was a bit on the salty side, but still very good. Will have to try their mac and cheese on of these days!

It's close to me, and it's beautiful right on the Riparian Preserve. Huge windows in the back so you can get a comfy seat and have a great view of the lake. Since you can request all your things online through the county website, getting what you're looking for is a breeze. They also have great reading programs for children, at least I think so. Who knows if they've been cut by now. Good place to escape the heat of summer.

I've been here twice now. Once for a Yelp Event, and again for lunch with the family. I KNEW my older daughter (the horror movie lover) would enjoy this place. I was right. The atmosphere is fun, with plenty to look at. Including the football game on the HD projector. The tables are a bit small for 4 people, but we made due. I had the Green Monster salad, and it was a huge salad and very tasty. Service was quick, but then again it wasn't very busy on a Sunday afternoon. They are planning several events so I hope that brings them business. Perhaps the light rail coming their way will help too. It's unique and I'd hate to see it go. There isn't a place like it around here, especially in DT Mesa!

I would give 2 1/2 stars if I could. We were here to trade in our minivan and buy a used Prius. Husband is the ultimate researcher, so we knew exactly the price of our trade-in, and how much we could reasonably walk out paying. They came in low on the trade it, but after going back and forth and explaining that we knew what they would re-sell the van for, they finally raised it up to exactly where hubby thought they could. There were many, many upsell attempts, which we shot down. Be prepared for that. They like the upsell. We ended up walking out without having to pay too much out of pocket, so after waiting around for am hour and a half (financing came over AGAIN to see if we wanted the super-DUPER extended warrenty) we checked to see if there was a problem. Turns out they thought we had already left with the car, so there was an extra 40 minutes of waiting that we were just forgotten. Good thing we checked, or I would be writing this review from the dealership. ;)  Just remember, if you are buying, new or used, do your homework up front, and stick to your guns. When they say their hands are tied, don't believe them. You can get exactly what you want at the price it should be, not the price they tell you. And now I have a Prius that is one year older than my van was, and has less miles on it.   (PS- the van is up on their website. They are asking exactly what my husband thought they would ask for. They didn't even take off my old stickers and clean up the inside before taking photos. I would have cleaned that thing up better if I were selling it on my own. A dealership should pay better attention to the details.)

It's a bar, it's a restaurant, it's not bad for a chain. They have quite a selection of beers, and I love their pretzels- their dipping sauce has beer in it! The cobb salad was good, and my friend enjoyed the baked mac and cheese. It's a good place to go when you can't think of anywhere else and want a broad selection of food. And beer.

Was a wonderful experience with my daughter and friends. To spend a couple of hours filling bags with food that you know are going to help people directly? Well, it's just heartwarming, and the very least anyone can do. All ready have a date to go back. Everyone should look into this organization and give a little time.

Had a veggie sub and it was really quite good. Fresh baked wheat bread, and toasted so the veggies were all yummy-gooey with the cheese. Can't wait to try more, I have a feeling they are going to get a lot of business from me when I'm at Gangplank.

Fun little place, though seating is REALLY limited so if it's busy best to get your meal to go. GREAT sandwiches. If you weren't looking for it, you would pass right by it on Higley next to Fresh and Easy. Don't pass by- stop and eat!

We were heading somewhere else for lunch, then saw their sign on the corner. Well played Bourbon Jacks! So we had lunch. Was pretty good. My friend had the mac-n-cheese, and I had the chicken salad. I love crunch in my salad, so the pecans added were perfect. We split an order of cornbread, which was pretty sweet but still very tasty.   The decor is neat- rustic and clean. The music was definitely too country for my taste, but I knew what I was getting into. ;) I'd go back for sure!

Whether you've seen it one time or dozens, it's always a nice evening walking through the Zoo with all the lights twinkling. Going the day after Christmas probably wasn't our best move, because the rest of the valley had the same idea. Next time I would go before Christmas, maybe early December.

Decent soup and salad options, and you are free to have more variety in what is included in your salad. The food itself was pretty good- I enjoyed my lunch. I will definitely be back because I want to try more of their soups! Also, can't say no to a chocolate-covered strawberry (which comes with your meal)!

Went to breakfast a couple of weeks ago with friends. It wasn't anything to write an awesome review about. I had the egg/mushroom omelet. I was a little runny, but I think it was because they got my order wrong the first time and rushed to make me another. I might go back and try other things, but it's also a bit over-priced so maybe not. When there are endless choices of breakfast places, I would go back if others were going there. I probably wouldn't suggest it.

Today I went to a Vision Board Workshop hosted in part by Lisa. I had never done a board before, and didn't know how this would go. It was a beautiful experience. Lisa gave a guided meditation to help us open up to what we might want to have on our boards. It was very helpful and I discovered some words I wanted to incorporate. It also helped my younger daughter (12) figure out what she wanted to include in hers. They brought all the supplies, and assisted in finding the right words and visuals for the boards. After, she gave a closing meditation to help kick off the greatness that the vision boards will bring. It was an insightful experience, and a relaxing way to spend a couple of hours. I have not tried the other services Sacred Harts offers- but I know I will in the future!

I decided on the $6 wash to get a little more cleaning umph. I really would like to say something positive, but my car was only partially clean, and the drying part didn't work at all so I had to re-clean my entire car to get rid of all the streaking. Someone suggested paying the $3 and go through twice, but if the car doesn't dry at least somewhat properly there's no point. Didn't save me any time and wasn't even the slightest convenience. The staff was friendly however.

Oh wow. I mean, wow. That was a GREAT breakfast! Eggs cooked to a perfect scramble and not watery, crisp bacon and hash browns, and their namesake and gravy? WOW.  I practically licked my plate clean.  It's a cute place too. Farmhouse-style and spacious. Prices were pretty much the same as any other breakfast place. The reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 was the waiting. It wasn't busy, but we waited for a good 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, and then they asked if we were waiting for a table. Um, yes. Yes we were. Once we sat down there was another rather long wait, but once we ordered everything was prompt. I definitely would suggest this to others! I want to go back tomorrow!

Went and grabbed dinner around 4:30. The drive-through was only a few cars in, but still went to the walk-up counter instead. I had the Spinach Bacon salad and my daughter had the BBQ. We had our order in about 5 minutes after ordering.  Unfortunately they forgot the avocados on the BBQ salad. The portions were decent sized, I wasn't stuffed after eating, but was satisfied. I will definitely give their other salads a try.  I see from other reviews they have been running out of product and messing up orders. I would say since they have only been open a couple of weeks to give it another chance. Opening a new business is always a little bumpy. Hopefully they will be reading these reviews so they can correct some of these issues.

This is the third Paradise Bakery I've reviewed, so it's apparent I love the place. This is the cleanest one I've been in. Still haven't had anything other than the Bleu Cheese crumble salad, but I'm a creature of habit. :-)  I did take a couple of bites of the husband's Southwestern Caesar, and it was pretty good too. It has quite a kick so if you don't like spicy I don't recommend it. He doesn't like a lot of heat and it was too much for him. Paradise is a good "I am not sure where to go so I'll stick with what I know" sort of place to eat.

Was here for our monthly book club. Good sized place, love the meat-hook lighting. ;) I ordered a cheese burger fi, onion rings and a beer. The burger was really good, honestly better than Five Guys. And I love Five Guys. The onion rings are the best I've ever had. It's a little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it if you want a little more gourmet to your burger occasionally. Want to go back and try some of their "secret" menu items.

An odd place for a seafood restaurant, between a Kohl's and a Dollar Tree, but we decided to give it a try. Love the decor, it's very spacious and even though it was busy, it didn't feel crowded. Our server was very nice and attentive. We started with the lobster bisque, and I could have had 10 bowls of it. Delicious! Husband also liked it very much, and we were wishing we had ordered bowls instead of cups.   We played it safe on main entrees, I had the Surf and Turf Burger and husband had the fish and chips. They were average, and I felt a bit disappointed there wasn't more crab meat on my burger. Still, we want to come back and try their steamed items, they are made fresh right at the bar. A nice little gem tucked away in a basic strip mall.

Such a fun little spot for the DT art district! Everyone was so nice, and we were seated immediately. It was very difficult to decide what to eat, everything looked wonderful. I decided on the French Dip, and husband had the Reuben. The Dip was extremely flavorful and well-made. The Reuben was also tasty, but it lacked the amount of meat the French Dip had. Their home brews are not available yet, but I wasn't too disappointed as there were all local brews to choose from, including my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate Ale.   This was their soft-opening, and I look forward to going back and tasting more off the menu!

Dear me. I try and be stingy with 5 stars, but Southern Rail earned all five last night. I was there for the grand opening and they were not serving their full menu yet, so I was excited to return when a friend decided to have her birthday dinner there. We arrived a little early for our reservation, but no problem we were seated within a couple of minutes. Our waiter was right there to bring us water and get us started on drinks.   The fried green tomatoes and the pull apart rolls with apple butter were devine. I was stuck between ordering the duck or the pork, then our waiter described them both and I ended up with the duck on dirty rice risotto and collard greens. Amazing, the duck basically melted in my mouth. Everything was so full of flavor, and just the right amount so you are not too full, but satisfied. Also had the beignets for dessert, those were also perfect. Chef Beckett happened to be in the kitchen last night, so he came out and said Happy Birthday to the guest of honor, which was so nice. She has always loved his restaurants and his cooking, so she fan girled just a little bit.   It was a perfect dinner. The wait-staff was attentive, the food was excellent, and although it is a very noisy place, I want to go back soon! (It's pricey, so unfortunately it can't be a weekly (or daily) event as much as I would like it to be.)
