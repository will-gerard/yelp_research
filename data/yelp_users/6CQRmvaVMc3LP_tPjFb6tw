This is a small Italian place. The food is really good, but I have had better dishes elsewhere. I can't say that I love everything on the menu, but I am always satisfied with what I get.   I like the atmosphere a lot- quaint, family owned, the staff is personable and friendly.   It is a tad on the expensive side, but I think the food and service is worth the price.

I went here with my boyfriend yesterday because of the reviews on Yelp and we were both really disappointed.   The atmosphere is very club like- if you're into that sort of thing then it's something that won't bother you. But, it definitely wasn't my kind of ambiance. It seems like a place that should be on Mill Ave. Really you are paying for the atmosphere of a club-like environment, not the food.   The food was terrible. It was really bland, hardly any taste to anything we ordered, even the sushi rolls that were supposed to be spicy were still tasteless. Even the avocado on our rolls tasted like nothing.   I went expecting the same kind of food as RA, but RA is so much better. I would rather pay RA's full price menu than eat at Blue Wasabi for happy hour. This place is not even worth trying- it was a waste of 20 bucks.

I love this place! Everything I've had here is good. The staff is friendly and attentive. The only problem is that there is usually a wait, no matter when you go. But, it is totally worth the wait.

Food was amazing, staff was attentive, the owner came by twice. Atmosphere is modern and sheek. My fiance' and I were really impressed.
