Been going here for a few years and always loved it.  Yelp typically doesn't let you down.  Instead of going to many of the crappy joints downtown before concerts and sporting events we go here.  Even on the way out to Cricket for a concert.  Nice wines, cheese for all you cheese lovers, salad nicoise awesome, empanadas very good, and I could go on.  Jeff is usually at the bar and he is awesome.  Go there, a great wine option in the valley.

This place sucks, simply put.  Older venue with narrow hallways, a bitch to get a drink or beer, can hardly walk around the lines of people in the way.  Everything else is what you would expect from an older covered basketball stadium.  The acoustics sound pretty good concert wise.  I always wish concerts were elsewhere - dodge, cricket, jobing.

Celebrity is one of the better concert venues in the valley.  Sometimes the stage revolves and other times they do a 3/4 house show and it doesn't.  Either way, good place to see a show.  The bar downstairs is decent, friendly bartenders.  Dodge is probably my favorite venue but for smaller or mid sized concerts/acts this is the place.

This place is great all the way around.  Went there for happy hour and had a variety of wines by the glass plus a couple of different antipasto plates.  Also, ordered a salad and soup - great stuff.  Suffice it to say that we will be back.  Good food, cool atmosphere, nice wines by the glass, and the service is above average.  Go there, it's worth it.

Went back just to see if it was as good as it was the last time.  It was.  This place is worth a stop.  We took friends and they loved it.  The bruschetta and antipasta board are great.  Wines by the glass also very good.  Go, go, go.

Probably more of a 3 1/2 but it's close to a 4 so what the hell.  Tasty 2 gyro plate with fries, it's a make your own plate basically.  The young girl at the counter was very friendly and the food came up fast for take out.  I thought the gyro meat was very good, maybe a little overly salty but it's heavy fast foodish food so it's not the end of the world.  The restaurant itself is clean, nothing special but does the trick.  Will go back.

Don't go here period. My wife went here last week for a mystic tan. You go into the room, leave you clothes and jewelry on the chair, and go in the booth. Her wedding ring fell on the floor when she was getting dressed after the tan.  She was busy and realized that it had fallen on the floor so called them immediately while we were running errands afterwards.  They put her on hold for ever even after knowing how scared and heartbroken she felt about it being on the floor of the room.  We drove there and the manager that was there when my wife was there, the only person working there at the time, had already left.  She had cleaned the room and other clients may have been in the room.  Told the girl at the counter that we wanted to speak to the manager right away and of course she never answered her phone or called the location back. Look, we are intelligent people and realize that we may never see the ring again.  However, the way a business deals with a situation is the key.  Simply be responsive, show you care about your customers, take something like this seriously, and so forth.  They did NONE of the above.  The manager never called us back even though I told the girl at the counter that I would speak to my attorney.  As a rule, if you tell 10 people that you hated the service at a business they will in turn tell 5 or 10 people.  Ultimately, one bad experience can cost a business 50 - 100 lost customers.  I have about 1,000 contacts in my address book - friends, family, colleagues, clients, and the like.  Guess what Jamaica Me Tan you probably just lost 5 - 10 thousand potential customers because your staff was unprofessional and couldn't show us the least bit of care.  They could have offered to call the customers that had used that room, called management to respond to us (someone beyond the young girl manager), or anything.  They didn't and I am talking to my attorney.  Whether they are liable for the ring or not isn't my concern anymore.  The ring was expensive and more importantly has a sentimental attachment.  They just frankly didn't care at all so it's only fair to let people know what they are getting for their hard earned dollars.  There are tons of tanning joints so go somewhere else.

We happened to be nearby and had not been here before. It was well worth it.  We wanted Teppanyaki primarily and got it.  Nice little place, very clean, and solid service.  We tried the chili shrimp app and a couple orders of nigiri for starters (yellowtail and tuna).  All excellent.  We eat sushi all the time and just wanted to get a feel for the quality of the sushi for future visits.  We ordered 2 teppan dinner entrees, the halibut and filet.  The chef was super friendly and did a great job.  The miso soup, salad, fried rice, and veggies were flavorful (awesome actually).  We requested medium for the halibut and medium rare for the filet and both were right on.  We eat well more than our fair share at restaurants and love trying different places but of course love our favorites.  We are realists when it comes to restaurants and expect quality ingredients, a clean place, responsive service, and tasty food.  We got all of that today and will be back.  The economy is tough and they deserve our business.

We have been eating here for over 4 years and love this place.  It has become our breakfast and weekend place of choice.  Nothing like having a cup of coffee and a great breakfast with your family or friends.  We have gotten to know all of the servers very well and love seeing them.  We have been to all of the supposed hot breakfast joints in phoenix, scottsdale, chandler, tempe, and gilbert.  Living in the east valley there are a few decent places and in the entire Phoenix area there are some good to very good choices.  However, if you want a great down home breakfast, servers that are attentive, and a first rate chef/cook that has a great palate and creative omelettes then go here.  The lunch items are great too.  My wife eats various things but I am a breakfast person.  The cinnamon roll is awesome.  I also love the blueberry wheat pancakes.  Get some eggs with bacon or link sausage, good stuff.  They also have sausage gravy and chipped beef gravy.  Hard to find and tasty.  My wife loves the chicken pot pie and the skillet fried chicken.  It's very reasonable and you'll love it.

We have been here a zillion times since my first review a few years ago and love the place more than ever.  The food is always good, tasty, and big portions.  We've gotten to know all of the servers and they are all attentive, warm, and good at what they do.  The place makes you feel at home and comfortable.  It's next door to Liberty Market and I'm always surprised that people walk over to Farmhouse, see there is a 10-15 minute wait, and impatiently just go to Liberty.  Look, I've been to Liberty probably 3 or 4 times and its good but stopped going after there was a nice long hair in the eggs. Farmhouse is a nice small family owned business and the food is great.  I usually either get eggs over medium, half bacon and sausage, fruit, crispy hashbrowns, and coffee OR an omelet with turkey, green onion, tomato, mushrooms, and avocado.  Both awesome.  The French dip is great and the daily specials are all excellent.  We've tried most of the menu and love it all.  The chili is very good also.  As far as desserts, try the cakes they have available week to week.  Check it out.

Very good place.  It is cozy, not loud, and mellow.  The sashimi was very fresh.  For $20 we ordered a sashimi plate that had about 6 types of fish.  The miso soup and seaweed salad were well above average.  We tried a sake, which I never remember the names of.  It was also good.  Red wine I remember, sake always forget.  We also ordered an albacore roll with garlic and pickled onion.  Sounds a little different but so good.  The prices are  reasonable and the waitress was very attentive and sweet.  Will be back.

Been here several times and although a little pricier than celebrity or marquee, ticket and drink-wise, still a great venue.  Nice seats, good acoustics, plenty of bars and bathrooms.  Will go back for concerts.  Probably have been here a dozen times over the last few years and love going back.  It's like any large venue when it comes to parking and drinks, more expensive.  It goes with the territory.

A short review is in order here because after all we are talking about freakin donuts.  However, in AZ there are no good donut shops for the most part.  We had three donuts - glazed, chocolate long john, and a chocolate old fashioned/sour cream.  The last was a bit stale.  The first two were great.  We will go back.  Nice little place and it's open 24 hours.

Really like this little place.  Quaint and a nice patio.  We had the Greek omelet, which was awesome.  The omelet had pepperoncinis and it really added a lot to the dish.  It also included real artisan sourdough toast.  The two egg breakfast with sausage, fruit, and a side berry pancake were also very tasty.  The fruit syrup that came with the pancake was a bit sweet so a little goes a long way.  The coffee selection was nice as well.  The Mexican Mocha and Americano were both awesome.  Would go there just to have a coffee.  Finding it is a little tricky.  It's in the outdoor Scottsdale mall area.  Either go to the Mission and walk around the parking garage, around to the right then left, and enter the mall area from a skinny hallway OR go in the main street entrance to the outdoor mall, lots of nice landscaping, and walk straight thru the small bridges and sidewalks until you get an opportunity to go right and walk all the way around the corner until you see orange tables with umbrellas.  Behind and Indian restaurant.  On the way, there is another place that has orange tables on the left and that's not it.  Anyways, really liked the place.  The service was good.  A little slow at times but nothing major.  Check it out it's worth it.

I give it 4 starts for ambiance, location, fun, and people watching.  The food isn't bad but could certainly be better.  Look, this is a chain and typically chains perform about the same across the board.  This place has pretty decent apps, a full bar, and sushi that is average or a little better.  The reason you go here is because on Thursday and Friday it is one of the best places to hang out for happy hour.  Usually cool attractive waitresses, service is reasonably good, wine by the glass are decent to good, mixed drinks about the same as most places, and so on.  Again, good location at the mall and a fun place to hang out with friends.  If you want 5 star dining this isn't it but if you want to enjoy yourself then give it a try.

Over the years I have been here many times.  Typically the people watching is great, the food is reasonably good, service above average, and so on.  However, this time it didn't cut the mustard.  A simple thing like a ketel one tonic or grey goose tonic, which is what a friend and myself ordered, terrible.  Yes, of course we have had vodka tonics before and know what they taste like.  The tonic was either flat, cheap, or something different altogether.  It would have also been nice if they had spilled a little in the glass, maybe two fingers.  There's wasn't anything.  It was diluted piss basically.  We ordered apps and waited a long time so we cancelled and closed out.  Went across to Yard House, much better.  Even the people watching was marginal - maybe the economy or have people just gotten sick of this place.

Have been here many times but not for a while.  In the past I have eaten here, tried several wines by the glass, tried a few wine flights, and enjoyed the weekend live music.  Mellow but cool.  The atmosphere is great, kind of dark and mysterious, classy, and a progressive wine and food menu.  The selection of people is always interesting.  It typically gets going later.  Sitting at the bar is fun because you get a bird's eye view of most of the place - entry, bar, and main room.  Sitting on one of the couches of tables/chairs is cool too because it is super comfortable.  Whether you are with your spouse/girlfriend/boyfriend or just friends (and looking for someone else) it's a great place.

This was our last stop on a long night.  I have seen concerts here before but never reviewed it.  It's a good little concert venue.  A little tight but fun with good acoustics.  We just went to close the night out because they had a band playing 80's and wanted to see how it was on a Saturday.  Simply put, worthwhile.  The cocktails were good, the band was a good time, and there was a crowd.  Everybody was having fun, dancing, singing along, about half girls and half guys.  Good all around.

Like this place.  The inside does look like a pub to some degree but with hints of wine bar throughout.  The wine list was nice and different.  The patio was cool at night with the misters.  Just be careful because one of the couches gets soaked.  Good service.  A nice wine bar option in scottsdale.

Have been here a few times but usually for drinks.  The atmosphere is fine.  Just went there for apps and drinks and it was terrible.  All of the food was cold.  The crab taco special was marginal, very little crab.  The mango salsa it came with was good but they provided so little you just didn't have enough to do anything with.  The mini shrimp avocado tostadas were good but cold.  The soft tortilla fish tacos are usually pretty good but again cold.  The app with chips and three dips was decent.  The serving size are limited on the salsa and guacamole.  The margaritas are average at best.  Even with premium tequila they are just not made very well.  Look at my review of Barrio Cafe.  Our server was terrible.  She was hard to get or find, didn't pay attention to what we said most times, and waited forever to bring our food.  The apps took about 40 minutes and the place was not busy so go figure.  Having a drink or two here is fine as long as you stick with wine or beer but the service and food just aren't up to snuff.

I have a lot of the same things to say.  Celebrity is old but has a nice circular stage and great acoustics.  Dodge is nice and more expensive but a great place to see a concert.  My beef with Marquee has always been that it is a cheap warehouse and it is a bit of a dump.  Seeing a concert at a dump can have value too if it has some history or just a cool ambiance/environment.  Marquee has none of the above.  I will say that the ketel one tonics were stiff and the bartender was responsive.  Otherwise, it's pretty hot because the doors are open and they have a couple of large fans inside and that's about it.  Many bands sound somewhat marginal there because the acoustics are just not very good.  However, the concert we saw this week sounded very good so that was a nice suprise.  I usually go to rock n roll shows if that gives you and idea of the type of music and the volume.  LOUD.  Gotta love it.

Have been here maybe three times and will continue to go.  The chorizo and eggs with hot flour tortillas are great.  Whether you're tired and hung over, or not, they are typically served fast and have a nice kick. The huevos rancheros with green chili beef is also very good.  My wife loves it.  A little coffee, cool waitresses, interesting people.  What else do you a need.  A very good breakfast joint.

Still love this place, has character, good breakfast choices, and so on.  The service this time could have been a little better.  Apparently, the waitresses friends were more important than the customers.  Nontheless, the food is good, waitresses are generally very good, and cool place.  Check it out.

Have been here 3 times now I think.  Once for a full meal a year or two ago, drinks a couple weeks back, and a few days back for apps and drinks.  This last time was good.  The wines by the glass are good and the app selection had decent variety.  The short rib app is really good and has a nice kick.  The shrimp/fish cake was dry and marginal so he took it off the bill.  The atmosphere is nice because you can sit outside at the bar, misters, fairly quiet, cool place.  We were there somewhat late and so it seemed that all of the employees were drinking and smoking at the bar.  That was a little annoying.  I get that they are off and want a drink, that's cool.  However, it's a business so the customers should have the run of the place.  Either way, I would recommend it.

Coming home, tired, and hungry.  A little spicy fried chicken and biscuits hits the spot.  It's what you would expect, it's fast food.  The order taker was friendly and the order was correct.  Most importantly, it tasted good.  Go there.

I would say this is a well deserved 4 star.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and the food was very good.  We ordered the pork egg rolls, mushroom stir fry with shrimp, shrimp fried rice, and the chow fun.  The food was delicious overall.  The chow fun wasn't as good as hoped but maybe the drive home affected the noodles.  Either way, really liked the place and will be back.

It's a typical large indoor arena on the new side.  Very nice place, clean overall, clean bathrooms (nice suprise), and plenty of food and drink stands.  I have been here a number of times but haven't written a review.  Big acts or bands play here so the tickets are typically pricey but what do you expect.  The trick is to spend the $15 for valet because you literally pull up by an entrance and are inside in a minute.  Beautiful.  The acoustics are good and again what you would expect.

What a great place.  A little dark, dark wood that you would expect in an old steakhouse, experienced servers that know what their doing.  The french dip is a large portion, tender, and with perfect au jus.  The bacon BBQ onion and cheddar burger was a favorite also.  Good starter salad and fries as well.  Wines by the glass were fine.  They were packed for lunch but they were able to seat us almost right away.  The quality of the food and service were both great.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars.

I have been fortunate lately because most places that I've taken the time to eat at have been very good.  This place is no exception.  Great authentic Mexican food.  I had slow roasted pork tacos with incredible fries and chipotle ketchup.  Simple but great food.  The pork tacos were very tender and had just the right amount of spice.  My wife had an avocado, mango, shrimp, tomato salad with a vinegarette.  It was very tasty.  Again, simple and fresh.  This is the only place in the valley we've been where they can actually make a margarita correctly.  If you've ever been to Mexico they typically use quality tequila, fresh sqeezed lime juice, and and orange liquor (triple sec, cointreau).  The bartender here makes them just like that, no disgusting sweet and sour or other sweet juices.  You should be able to taste the tequila and just because there is tequila in the drink doesn't mean you're going to turn into a raging drunk and black out.  If you drink enough of anything that will happen.  A good 100% agave tequila adds flavor.  Try it you might like it.  He also gave us a great idea for making margarita's with tequila, lime, and a little agave syrup.  Cool guy and great idea.  You can buy agave syrup at trader joe's or fresh n easy.  We use 2 shots of tequila, 1 shot fresh lime juice, and 3/4 shot triple sec or cointreau.  However, instead of the triple sec or cointreau I am going to try 1 big teaspoon of the agave syrup.  Should be good.

Authentic good food.  Casual place and visually nothing special.  The server was funny and cool, the food was great.  Our group ordered a variety of things from tacos to burritos and a whole bunch of things to go into here.  Everything was very good and tasty.  The only thing we thought was that the margs could have been better, nore simple and authentic.  They are a bit americanized with maybe sweet and sour, which sucks.  The food and beer are great though.

Had dinner here last night with friends and been here two other times.  Everything is always fresh and creative.  Once you get past the sticker shock you realize it's Vegas and all nice restaurants cost an arm and a leg.  It's an experience though so just go with it.  We had miso soup, beef and lobster mini tacos, crab ceviche, shrimp and scallop tempura, some desserts, and of course sake.  Also, tons of sashimi including yelliowtail, tuna, red snapper, wild yellowtail, and snow crab.  All awesome.  The service was great, the place is very nice, and the food is always great and fresh.

Really a 41/2.  Back a week later except ate in the bar this time.  Had them make a scallop role in soy paper with caviar on top, awesome.  Also, stuck with sashimi again - yellowtail, snow crab, Japanese halibut, albacore, and octopus.  One tuna nigiri and miso soup too.  Had a couple martini's and had a shot of this unbelievable tequila called Deleon.  Very smooth and unique.  Expensive but we were celebrating so very worth it.  Service was very good and our server was very helpful and offered other local joints to eat at suggestion wise.  Expensive but a great place.

The food and service were very good.  As is typical with Vegas, when you get a bottle of wine they are pouring it at the speed of light so your table drinks faster and they ask you if you want another.  Why not but actually we'd like to taste it.  I had the seabass wrapped in a thin bacon, very good..  The make your own salad with up to ten items was great.  Everybody loved the food, the Orin Swift Prisoner by the bottle was fabulous (red blend from Napa), and the service was very good.  We closed things out with a tequila shot to get things moving along.  Will go back.

Been her several times and always found it to be good.  This time it was even better.  Glad to see they are stepping up their game a bit.  The 100+ beers on tap are always good and the wines by the glass are good enough (not great but what you would expect).  The sliders and fries are always good.  My friend ordered a spinach dip of some kind (app), he liked it very much.  Suprised he didn't swallow the plate and a piece of the bar with it.  It was busy, the bartenders were very attentive, and I will be back.  Happy hours here are good as well.

Been here a number of times and went this time for the Motley Crue residency.  Awesome show with crazy pyro.  The venue and seating were well above average, the cocktails were fine, and the security and organization to keep things moving were fine.  You can't expect perfection at a concert because people are people and lots of people always creates some issues.  Either way, always love seeing concerts here.  Staying in the hotel makes it even more convenient.

This place has a fun atmosphere with a variety of people for those of us who enjoy people watching.  More of a lounge feel.  It was happy hour and busy so we went to the bar for a drink, standing, but immediately got an outside patio table.  The patio is nice, the misters felt great.  The bottled beer was nice and cold but my friend thought the tap beer was not nearly cold enough. We switched to wine and others were having wine as well.  The wines by the glass had a nice variety of choices.  We tried a few and liked them all.  The trio of sliders were cooked perfectly, nice toppings, good bread.  The shoestring fries needed some flavor.  I love the style of fries but the cajun spice was flavorless.  A little salt and pepper and we were good.  The smoked salmon was very good - capers, red onion, greens, toast, etc.  I didn't have any artichoke dip but the others really liked it.  Overall, a fun place to hang out and have a drink.  Nice atmosphere and popular.  Go there, you'll like it.

Last time I really liked this place but we were here earlier, happy hour time.  I will go back for happy hour.  This time it was later, around 1130, and I was glad to see it was busy.  Sat at a booth and waited 10 minutes but no waitresses.  Went to the bar and couldn't get a drink, not that busy.  Went outside to back bar and they were completely nonresponsive.  If you want to be seen or are looking for a late night meat market then go.  Otherwise, stick to when the service exists earlier in the day.

There is nothing bad about this place.  Tons of gelato flavors that are delicious.  I had a carmel brownie flavor and a second flavor of very berry.  Both great.  We also got a chocolate coconut one that was very good.  That coffee isn't bad either.  Clean, simple, good atmosphere.

When they first opened I left a good review online and have been there a dozen times or more.  Wow. Today was terrible.  Almost like they cooked the chicken in the cashew chicken, let it sit out and then cooked it again.  Dry and zero seasoning.  The shrimp fried rice so bland you can't believe it even after dousing it with soy.  The quality and effort just seemed minimal.  Really disappointed.

Actually really good pizzas.  We live way closer to the san tan location but I believe they are franchised.  The reviews at this location were better and we were driving by it.  The iphone yelp app is always useful.  One pizza was sausage, mushroom, and olives with no cheese (dairy issues) and the second was jalapeno, mushroom, and pepperoni.  That one had cheese.  A side salad as well.  Good food.  Will go back from pick up.

This place is in the Forum Shops so the location and view of the strip are the attraction.  Don't valet in front of Caesar's, go to the right of Caesar's (as you are approaching it and driving towards the valet area) and there is a driveway on your right.  Take that and it puts you in front of a steakhouse with valet.  Go to the 3rd level and there it is.  Nice place, great view, and the service seemed to be very good.  It wasn't busy for lunch though.  I had the basics - miso soup, yellow tail and halibut sashimi, and tuna nigiri.  It was all fresh and very good.  It is an expensive place though relative to sushi that can be had elsewhere.  If you're going to spend that much you may as well go to Nobu in the Hard Rock.  Nobu has marginal atmosphere but good crowds and great sushi.  I would come back here but only for dinner on a busy night.

Go here once a week at least.  Love the little place.  Casual, good breakfast options, good americanos and other coffee drinks, and a cool lay out with the patio and large tall windows inside.  A couple of suggestions to the owners.  The doors are opening all the time so flies get in there, probably from Joe's farm restaurant next door.  Kidding but seriously too many freakin kids over there.  Maybe nothing you can do but there must be some bad ass fly killing technology out there.  Other than that bitch, love the place and will continue to go back.

Been here twice.  Very cool place with unique fresh dishes.  - they serve a rice liquor that's a touch weaker than vodka (good stuff) - chee burger (awesome) - steamed clams with red miso - aspargus - some sort of pot stickerish dish - variety of sashimi  All great.  Plus, they usually have specials, which are fabulous.

What can I say, I love whole foods or whole paycheck as some call it.  You have to be a little particular because it is pricey.  The produce is phenominal, service always good, beats starbucks when it comes to a mocha or coffee, and they have so many cool things.  It seems that they are running sales more because of the economy, which is a good thing.  We go there 2 - 5 times per month for this or that, love it.  Also, the berry smoothie they make at the coffee stand is very good.

Cool little place.  I would imagine a lot of regulars go here but a worthy coffee shop either way.  The Americano was very good and they had an unreal chocolate muffin with cream cheese on top more or less.  Awesome.  The service was friendly.  Cool decor as well.  Will go back.

What an awesome place.  First time there and had already eaten otherwise I would have ordered some sushi.  The place is fun, music going, busy, nice selection of people, and as my friend said (and I agree) one of the coolest/hottest bartenders around.  She's blonde, helpful, and cute - nice combo.  Overall though, the atmosphere is a winner.  It's not fancy or the nicest place you will ever go but it is fun period.  Go have a drink and hang out for a hour or two.

This is a very good place.  The tadig, ghormeh sabzi, rice, koobideh, and everything else were great.  Been going to the persian room for years ,once in a while.  This place is much smaller and the food is much better.  Will be back for sure.

Really a 4 1/2.  Sat at the bar and Damien was the bartender.  Ordered a Ketel One up cold three olives, very good.  They bring over a bread selection and had the wheat and pretzel breads, very good.  Then the best part, ordered the short rib with Indian spices and the root veggie side.  Seriously, both were awesome.  The Indian spice wasn't spicy just flavorful and the short rib fell apart with a fork.  So tender!  Had a glass of the Twenty Bench cab with it. When dessert came up I opted out for a drink instead.  They have a ton of unique bourbon's, whisky's, and many many scotch choices.  I went for the Pappy Van Winkle in an Old Fashioned.  This stuff is so hard to find but they finished that bottle and opened another.  The fact that they had a another was surprising.  Great drink.  Finally, a single espresso shot.  Good service, nice ambiance, and phenomenal food.  Puck is still pulling it off.

More of a 4 1/2!  Been here a few times and always excellent.  Service, even in the bar. is second to none.  Had the Indian spiced short rib and it's to die for.  So aromatic you can't believe it.  The carrots as a side are nice as well.  They give you so many snacks in the lounge area of the bar - popcorn, olives, miso peas, nuts, small bready pastries and tiny dessert assortment after dinner.  Awesome!  Also had the butter lettuce salad and it was very good.  The pretzel and five grain breads were amazing.  Had their version of an old fashioned and it was good but I have had better.  A Ketel One with three olives was tasty and a 20 year tawny to finish up the meal.  Really enjoyed it.  Will go back.

We've been here a number of times.  The margarita and bocca trio pizzas are very good.  Always have a nice crust, fresh toppings, and the wines by the glass are above average.  Cool and casual atmosphere with good service.  Will continue to go back.

Been to other locations and they are typically good.  Had a chopped salad and poke stack app for lunch with an alaskan amber beer.  It was all very good.  The bartender was good but could have been a little more social or talkative.  Either way, would go back.

Don't waste your money here.  16 bucks plus tip and they literally didn't clean anything inside the car.  I watched the guy and he just didn't give a shit.  Will never spend another dollar there.

In a very nice strip mall but the area is struggling so the AJ's has a big sale and looks like it may be closing down.  It's a shame because places like this get lost in the demise of a strip mall.  Lots of people live around there so hopefully they will maintain it.  First time here and really enjoyed it.  We sat in the bar and had a wine flight each, $7 each.  Good deal and pretty decent wines.  The bread with three side choices was nice but the bread could have been a touch more fresh.  Now the important part, the actual food.  They have a fried chicken tender app or you can get it as a breast in an entree.  It comes with mash potatoes, green beans, and a nice hearty brown gravy.  During happy hour it's only $7 and very good.  The halibut entree was very good.  It had crab and gnocchi, very tasty.  The banana cream pie dessert wasn't a piece of pie.  It was a cross between pie and mousse texture.  Really good but a little too sweet.  Overall, the portion are not huge but will satisfy you.  The quality is very good.  The bartender that came out to our table to serve us was very cool.  He let us try a sample of a unique vodka that he recommended and overall was a good guy.  That's always a nice touch at a restaurant.  Servers and bartenders that actually care and are social.  Check it out.

This place is a wine bar and store, where you can go pick the wine you want to uncord and drink or just order off the menu.  They have small plates and desserts, pretty simple good stuff.  We go here to have a glass of wine.  The staff is very cool and usually during parts of the weekend they have live mellow music.  It's not too loud or crazy, just a good time.  The ambiance isn't like many of the wine bars in the valley and I've been to many of them.  It's well worth going to especially on the front or back end of your night.  It's one of those comfortable places where everyone just belongs.

41/2.  We go here regularly and love it.  The owner and bartenders are fabulous.  It's a wine bar with food as well as a wine store on the far right.  We just went recently for Halloween and it was a blast.  Everybody was dressed up and there were some very elaborate costumes.  We mainly go to a wine bar or bar because it's inviting and you look across the bar at friends.  That is the case here with many of the patrons.  You'll see regular faces and they are all friendly.  The food menu is what you would expect, not an elaborate menu but provides some good options for the night.  Check it out.  We have really enjoyed going here over the last 2 - 3 years.  By the way, check out Bryan when he plays (one man band) on weekends.

Have now been coming here about once a week for maybe three years.  Loved it on my original review. As you continue to go here you love it more. Great staff, cool regulars and new customers, very good live music (especially Brian), and our neighborhood hangout.  Come here and check it out because you will come back.  I had written this and never finished it.  They ended up closing.  A lot of people were bummed because we all loved it.  Oh well.

Been here twice.  Loved the first time and would say it was incredible.  The second visit was maybe half as good.  The second visit was late and our waitress put on her fake smile when she walked over but completely turned before your eyes as she left the table to go to the bar.  She left our food out to sit right in front of us.  The kitchen called it out, she turned and saw it was out, kept bullshitting with her friends at the bar, came over 4 or 5 minutes later, and brought our cold food. Nice.  Let's go back to the first time when it was good.  It was early and there was a knowledgeable guy as our server.  He knew the dishes and sake and was geniune.  Imagine that.  The miso with white fish, spicy shrimp special, fried quail, and sake were all great.  We had other items but just can't remember.  Will go back but making it early so we can go back to the first experience.

Very nice little place with character near old towne.  It was busy on a Saturday, sat at the bar, and had a little meal.  Mango jicama salad, halibut, and pumpkin bread pudding.  All very good but the bread pudding was incredible.  It was funny because the bartender said my name when I sat down and said that such and such was expecting me.  She gave me a free glass of wine all while I'm confused.  She came back and said woops I guess you're not such n such.  However, same first name.  I told her no biggie and that I wanted to pay for the glass because it wasn't necessary.  She was beyond cool and still wanted to buy me the glass but since it was the end of the bottle (still 3/4 full) she gave me another full glass right after.  Then after a while a ordered a different red and had that as well.  Man, I was full and happy but had to figure out a way to fit that dessert down my gullet.  I did, no surprise.  Will be back.

41/2.  Love this place.  As a rule, if you go to places that get 4 or more on Yelp then you're typically safe and very good.  This is no exception.  The pork for two is so good.  The black and white bean sides are delicious.  Next time I have to get the guacamole made fresh, people around us had it and loved it.  The various bartenders I've met here are all very good and honest about the wine list.  The best red I believe is the first one of the red portion of the list.  Forgot what it was but very good.  I almost ordered something else, they gave me a taste and it wasn't my style, offered this other wine.  Fabulous stuff.  The restaurant is packed on weekends and the atmosphere is fun.  Going back for a business lunch tomorrow, can't wait.

Nice little place upstairs from Starbucks.  Great place to drop in and have a drink downtown.  We were heading to Dodge Theatre so we stopped in for a cocktail and enjoyed it.  I would recommend it.  The fresh grapefruit juice greyhounds were good.  Wines by the glass are above average as well.  Cool atmosphere.

Been here a few times at the bar just for an app and drink usually.  Had dinner once and it was good.  This time, we were supposed to meet the girls at blue wasabi an hour later so the guys belly up to the bar and we have drinks.  Didn't know the girls were there too on the patio.  The drinks and bar service are always good.  No big deal.  The girls tried the escargot, scallops wrapped in bacon, and nachos.  They said they were all good apps.  They ordered margs that were good not great.  Fresh juice but just not the way we would make it, needs more lime.  The beer and wines by the glass at the bar were what you would expect.  It's a good place.  Middle of the road, a little dark, and  not to loud.  Kona is across the way if you want more action and crowds, although this place gets busy too sometimes.

If you actually look at my reviews you will find that I have reviewed many local places and given them high marks.  This place is the exception.  Walking in and the bartender was coughing into his hands and touching pizza boxes with pizzas already in them and pouring drinks and touching receipts.  Disgusting.  The pizza itself was below average.  Decent crust but very few toppings and the sauce is done in their signature way where they put round dollops of sauce every so often on the crust instead of everywhere.  I'll take everywhere.  There was nothing but crust in several spots, bland as hell, and lame.  We were grossed out by the bartender and couldn't hardly eat anyways but we actually gave it a try.  I will never spend another dime in this location.

Have been to the other Postino's a couple few times but not this location until last night.  Similar theme, old post office rehab.  The bar faces inside and outside and is open, very cool.  The atmosphere is similar to the other location.  The happy hour is always good with $5 glasses of wine.  I tried a spanish red blend that was very good.  The board app with white beans, olives, italian meats, toasted bread, and so forth - all very good.  The white bean portion at the other location is much more generous but not that big of a deal.  If you're downtown just head up Central 5 or so minutes and you're there.  A worthwhile stop.

Great family owned place.  They own a farm as well as the meat store.  The pork chops, chorizo, and NY strips all looked great.  We bought pork chops with and without the bone and cooked them that night on the grill.  They were fantastic,  We don't eat pork chops very often so it was a nice treat.  The lady was very nice and at least you know where you are getting your meat from.  It's a little bit of a haul to get there but an easy drive and helping a small local business is always worthwhile.

Seen tons of concerts here.  Good outdoor venue.  Pay for the VIP bar access.  The booze at these joints could always be better but if you're going to get ripped off price wise you might as well get misters, comfortable chairs, clean bathrooms, and a place to hang out before the show starts.

Have been working out here for a few years and also spent the time and money to work with a personal trainer that they assigned to me.  The gym itself is usually in chaos, construction and changes, new staff (frequent) and so on.  I get it, you're changing the facility so it's more appealing considering there are new gyms popping up.  However, it's unfortunate that they did not spend this time and money on their employees because a number of them have made comments to me about the way they were treated and so they left.  I already paid for my agreement for the personal sessions but have several sessions left and now my trainer has left.  It's like your doctor, hair stylist or whoever.  Relationships matter and so you stick with that person if they do a good job.  Mountainside assigned me to my trainer in the first place and now he's gone and they will not refund the dollars based on the remaining sessions.  I called Core Concepts and talked to a nice guy but had to listen to how they are changing their structure and management and are in the best place they've ever been in.  In essence, how things have changed.  It has only been a week since my trainer left and the reasons seem to be the same as everybody else that I've spoken to that has left over the last 3 - 4 years.  Change may be coming but hasn't happened yet.  Also, that they have trainers that will do as good of a job or better than the trainer I already had.  Maybe that's true or maybe not but they won't find out because I will remain loyal to who they assigned me to because they've already done a good job and have proven themselves.  The agreement locks you in so I would be careful to any new members looking for personal trainer services.  I have heard a lot of doubters about this place and have always tried to overlook that.  Now I am one them and will not work with another trainer there or sign up again period.  Buyer beware.

After vine expressions closed many of us have tried this place.  I like new things and love different types of cuisine but this place doesn't hit the spot.  It's nice to go somewhere and get a wine list by the glass where you can choose a wine you enjoy but of course you want to know the freakin vineyard.  Not here.  By the glass, the list just has varietals - shiraz, cab, etc.  They change their list a lot but so do many places.  The food - below average.  Tried the stew that they said was great and famous.  Bland.  The sliders were like eating a salt lick, too salty.  The servers are nice but they tend to ramble on and give you a 15 minute dissertation on the menu and why you shouldn't look at the last page because it's not available yet but they want you to know it's there.  Finally, a few people mentioned the sucky chairs.  Boy, they weren't kidding.  They have many stools at tables with no back.  Customers should be comfortable, this is not.  The seats with backs have as much padding as a 2X4.  Bottomline, uncomfortable.  You want better options, here you go.  The living room in Chandler, my wine cellar in Ahwatukee, postino in Arcadia, 5th and wine in Old Towne, kazimierz in Old Towne, and terroir wine pub in N Scottsdale.  Been to all of them and all significantly better.    Tons more on Yelp.  Postino is supposedly opening where grainbelt used to be across from Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert so when that's there a local joint should be available.

Been here twice and really enjoyed it.  I typically like more mellow places that are a little bit more quiet or low key but this is a nice change.  Mix of young and old, reasonably good list of wines by the glass, the food is pretty good as well.  had a french dip this last time that was great.  The flat bread pizzas a good too.  Nice atmosphere, busy on weekends, and around 9 or 10 it transitions to being a little louder with a lounge/club feel.  Cool place for the east valley.

Had a reservation for 3 for a business dinner (friends really).  Arrived on time but still waited in the bar for 30 minutes for a table.  OK though, had a cocktail and caught up.  The double lobster tail, and bone in filets were what we ordered, along with starter salads.  The quality of the ingredients was very good, the service was great, and the location is nothing to sneeze at.  Great bread too.  We were in the restaurant right by the entry to something called the birds nest I think.  Very open restaurant right by Aria in the CityCenter.  Great place with a big bill but that is expected.  The wine list is a bit out of hand.  I never mind spending good money on a great wine list, which it was, but the median price point was over the top.  I go to many nice business dinners so I have an idea what wines should go for and these were ridiculous in some cases.  I will tell you that for the first time ever a restaurant manager called me the day after and left a message to make sure we enjoyed our dinner and that we would be back.  Nice touch since nobody every does that.  Mastros's is good everywhere and this location is no different.

This place is still a 4 to 4 1/2.  Pricey but great food and service.  The steaks, lobster tail, and sea bass were all worthwhile.  They have a nice bar that you can grab a drink at before dinner and the music they play live is nice.  Typically, standards.  Leave room for dessert.

This place is more like a 41/2.  Pricey but well worth it.  This is the second time we've been here and just as good as the first time.  We ordered a couple of Ketel One martinis for starters.  With dinner ordered a bottle of their Iconoclast house Cab, pretty good and reasonably priced.  The wild salmon was to die for, couldn't have been happier.  A side of crab and sautéed spinach were nice as well.  The ahi was excellent to boot.  The fennel added a nice level of flavor.  Let me just say this - I LOVE THAT FREAKIN BREAD!  It is so good it's hard to describe.  Comes out in a cast iron pan and glazed with a little butter and salt,  WOW.  I would pay big bucks just for the bread.  The truffles when you leave we're a nice touch.  I had a single espresso also, which was as expected.  Solid service, beautiful view and sunset, and great food.  A drive to get up there but absolutely worth it.

This was my first acupuncture appt ever and I was very open to the treatment.  It was fantastic and so much more than I had even hoped.  Dana is an unbelievable person and authentic beyond words.  She really tried to look at all of the issues and other methods of healing and working towards resolution, not just acupuncture.  The conversation  and level of delving into the issues at hand were very helpful and I'm looking forward to working on them.  Now, I know you want to know why I saw her, and frankly it's not much different than what many people are going in for, but if I told you then you would be infringing on my HIPPA rights (Now Wouldn't You).  LOL.  Go see her, she's awesome.  Back issues, acid reflux, stress, and all the stuff many of us have.

Really great place.  Live nearby and never knew they were there until I looked on Yelp.  Finally, good sushi in the east east valley near Power Ranch.  Been here twice, once at the bar and once at a table.  Solid service, clean and very good food.  Have tried cocktails, sake by the bottle and lots of sashimi.  The 24 piece sashimi plate is the best deal on the menu.  Get over you're fear of raw fish.  It's light, tasty and a fun experience.  The real wasabi is an interesting feature and hard to find anywhere.  A little tiny dollop of that on nigiri or sashimi and you're good.  Tried the fried rice, snow crab California roll and miso soup too.  Everything was fresh and fantastic.  Can't wait to go back.

Great little place.  We ordered shredded beef tacos, beef and potato tacos, carne asada burrito, bean tostada, and a cheese enchilada.  All were awesome.  The salsa and red sauce were both good as well.  Everything tasted authentic, even the beans and rice.  Casual, cheap, clean, local, and family owned.  I'm glad we finally went.  We'll be back.

Man, the food has really fallen.  We have been here a number of times and loved the food, left very good reviews and wanted to go back.  Went today and talk about dry bland shredded beef tecos.  Polite young guys running the place but no freakin salt or seasoning and over cooked.  Whoever made the shredded beef, wake up and add salt and pepper.  Didn't even finish my food and am disappointed.  Won't be going back anytime soon.

Been here 3 or 4 times now and really like the place.  Clean look, really original different breakfast choices, the coffee bar options are great, and so on.  The service can be slow at times but not terrible.  The eggs and meatloaf are phenomenal, chicken and waffles very good, chorizo potatoes awesome, cherry bacon love it, and the blueberry pancakes are nice and light.  Loved all of it.  The hot americano served in a real coffee cup is nice.  Yes, I am sick of paper cups.  A real cup is a nice change.  Go here, good place.

This place is more over a 41/2 but at least a 4. The breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all worthwhile.  We've tried them all.  Been here many many times.  The bar is fun to grab a drink at during games or on a weekend night.  We love the servers, bartenders, and managers.  Great place.  When they get super busy it can be a little slower but nothing major and frankly no restaurant is perfect.  Since the other places have opened in the strip mall the whole area has really picked up, which is nice to see.  The Cali Benedict, shrimp and chorizo hash, and the Florentine are excellent.  The eggs and sausage with a biscuit are very good.  Love the biscuits!  The coffee drinks are always tasty, love the Americano and Soy Latte.  They also have many coffee drinks that aren't on the menu so ask or tell them what you want.  For lunch, the goat burger is really good.  As far as dinner, the short rib pasta and the short rib dinner are very good.  Really a nice addition to the local east valley breakfast, and overall restaurant, scene.  This place is one of our staples.

It is exactly what you would expect from the Postino crew.  Cool warm urban place, big patio (too hot to go out during the day though, it's Phoenix baby), and a great $5 happy hour.  The service was good, the food was hot and tasty, the cocktails they have on their menu were very unique and we tried a couple as well.  Good stuff.  The #1 was very good, I guess i would call it refreshing.  The wall of cassette tapes was vintage and cool as well.  These guys understand what customers want.

There's no doubt that the beef buns and green onion pancakes are really good.  The shrimp fried rice and orange chicken were good not great.  It's just a small strip mall chinese joint, nothing fancy.  A humble hole in the wall with tasty food and a pleasant staff.  Will be back.

Went here after Windsor, right next door.  Great creamy ice cream.  Loved the peanut butter flavor.  They have regular, sugar, cake, and pretzel cones.  Fresh cookies too.  The bartender at Windsor told me that they will make an ice cream sandwich.  He described his choice of a peanut butter cookie on top and chocolate chip on bottom with banana ice cream.  Wow, that sounds awesome.  We will be back.

Seemed like a nice pet grooming service.   Took our two puppies there and they were responsive and the place seemed clean upfront.  The dogs looked good three hours later and they were done on time.  Will go back.

Have been here 3 or 4 times now and think it's a great place.  Nice atmosphere (inside and outside), good selection of wines and cocktails, and the food has not disappointed in any way yet.  The fish special is always good.  This last time the sea bass was great.  The scallop app is always tasty and cooked just right.  Service-wise, they have been attentive whether we have been at the bar or in the restaurant.  This is a great place to throw into your wine bar or restaurant rotation.  Slowly but surely the east valley is getting a few good places to go to and this is one of them.

Been here 3 times in the last several days.  Very cool place with an urban feel but very roomy and sophisticated in it's own way.  The French Dip and burger were both very good.  The fries were awesome as well.  The brunch was tasty, eggs and bacon, French toast, coffee, mimosa's, and more.  The employees are very friendly and helpful too.  Will try the locations in AZ for sure.

Came here for brunch and it's underwhelming.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and others at the table ordered the shrimp tacos.  Good chorizo and eggs is just that, chorizo and eggs.  Not tomato, other veg, and bland chorizo.  This dish was marginal.  Just go to the other 1,000 places that serve chorizo.  Overall, everything was bland.  The Bloody Mary bar is a nice idea but also somewhat average as far as the mixers.  Maybe later in the day for dinner or drinks but brunch or lunch, no thanks.  Won't be back.

Apparently only been open for 10 weeks and we have been to The Mission a number of times.  Wanted to go somewhere new tonight so looked on Yelp.  This is a sister restaurant to The Mission.  What a great experience.  Didn't have a reservation so bellied up to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks while we waited for the kale salad, lobster role, and filet with corn and balsamic reduction.  All fantastic.  Wouldn't have changed a thing.  The caramel upside down apple cake with pistachio ice cream.  Wow, awesome in general but the ice cream was unreal.  Good food, good drinks, good bartender, and good times.  Will be back and I would recommend that anyone check it out.

All of you that love this place, seriously?  I've been to the airport location a number of times and always disappointing or bad.  If you want a water, a bag of English muffins, or maybe a cup of fruit then it's fine.  I just ordered eggs, sausage, fruit, and an English muffin.  They weren't scrambled but just one flat thin overcooked egg.  The sausage was disgusting.  So overcooked and hard it clearly came from early early this morning and sat or from yesterday and was warmed.  The fruit cup, different than the prepackaged fruit they sell separately, was dark brown around all the edges.  Look at my other reviews and you'll find that I am always consistent with reviews and give places a second chance.  I've been to their main Phoenix location and the market was great. The food we had their was mildly disappointing to average.  I will not spend another dollar here.  When you leave a review try to forget your perception of the place and how awesome their reputation alone is.  Judge it on the experience.  This place sucks and after multiple times I've solidified that fact.   Colleagues have told me the same but they don't yelp.  Many of these popular local restaurants that have airport locations use airport employees because it's cheaper.  The exception that I'm aware of is Cartel Coffee.  They employ their own employees that have been properly trained and care about the end product.  This place just isn't worth the great tasty muffins.

Left positive reviews for this Cartel before and been here many times at the airport.  Today was disappointing.  Usually the people are friendly and attentive but not today.  The girl taking my order looked at me as if I was inconveniencing her.  I ordered a hot Americano but it was barely warm.  Last I checked, hot means hot because it's a hot drink, you want it to stay good and warm for a while bla bla bla.  To me that shows a lack of interest or caring and I always thought this place and Chelsea's Kitchen were the only two places worth a shit at the airport.  Trained employees, friendly and quality food/drink.  Cartel was NOT that today and won't be back anytime soon.

Been here twice.  First time was decent because they had a deal through Yelp for an app, 2 entrees, dessert and a drink each for 30 or so bucks.  They screwed up my pasta but the server made up for it.  This time our server took our order and never came back.  Asked for bread 4 times and nothing until we were completely done.  Ordered spaghetti and sausage no cheese but they bring it with tons of cheese.  Sent back and wait for the new dish.  Had to practically beg for another drink because nobody came around.  I'm not going back.

Love this place.  Went there for the first time yesterday and found a great vibe, excellent food, unique spirits and wine/beer, and cool people.  Tabitha was fantastic at the bar and Mark was super passionate about their offerings.  We really enjoyed talking to them.  We ordered the wild boar bolognese over home made pappardelle.  I don't know the chef's name but that dish is unbelievable.  We split it and ordered another for take out.  As soon as we walked in the door at home we wolfed that down as well.  Drink wise we ordered the Adventure Cocktail, a couple glasses of a red blend, their home made cherry infused bourbon, and a super smooth grappa.  I think it was called Tagliatella.  Enjoyed everything.  Will be back very soon.

Stayed at the palms, two miles away, and around 1000 pm wanted something to eat.  Everything closed except 24 hour restaurant, which sucks when you want sushi or steak or something more unique.  This place was open to midnight, got there in less than 5 and really enjoyed it.  Nice staff and the quality of the fish was excellent, as good as anything on the strip for 30-50% less.  Had a nice unfiltered sake, a sashimi platter that was great, miso soup and a take on friend chicken that was very good.  Will be back.

Will have stayed here three times in the recent weeks.  Years back I used to find the casino a bit annoying here because it's was smaller and crazy busy.  Now with the newer tower and a good stable of long time restaurants I find the place appealing as a guest.  The king casino tower suite was very nice, cool decor, and would stay there again.  Last time we were supposed to get a king suite in the newer tower but they were booked so they upgraded us to the boom boom suite.  Very cool and huge room equipped with a stripper pole.  Gotta love Vegas.  Cool hotel and will be back.

You guys are crazy.  Maybe your regulars and just love it.  Good for you.  We are regulars in Gilbert at a number of places and I have been to just about every worthwhile wine bar, tapas place, or cocktail lounge in AZ and a lot of the west coast and this place doesn't compare.  The decor is a yawn and the vibe is like being in an elevator with that horrible music.  The cocktails were fine and ordered some small stuff.  I ordered a burger with no cheese and of course it has cheese.  No dairy, a simple request.  Made another and it was practically raw.  I should give it 1 star but whatever.  Won't be back.

More like a 4 1/2.  Really enjoyed this place.  Nice bar and dining room.  Warm, casual, great staff, and nice ambience.  We sat at the bar first and had a couple of cocktails, a Ketel One up and a drink on their menu called the Sunset.  Both were well made and tasty.  We had the Funghi pizza and Heirloom tomato pasta as entrees, the brussel sprout and kale salad, the grilled bread and olive oil, and a couple wines by the glass.  Everything was well above average, seasoned well, and exactly what you want when dining out. Typically, pasta dishes can do you in because they are so heavy so I usually take some home.  In this case, I finished the whole dish because it was that good.  They have their own parking lot so the parking was a breeze.  Can't wait to go back,

The chai latte and americano were very smooth and flavorful.  Nice assortment of baked goods as well.  Family owned and accommodating staff.  Better coffee than The Coffee Shop.  The breakfast sandwich on English Muffin needs improvement.  It was like an egg frisby on a tiny English Muffin with a tiny piece of sausage.  Overall, liked it and will go back.

Stopped in here about 2 1/2 - 3 weeks ago for a drink after going to EVO for dinner.  EVO recommended it.  Great little place.  Nice ambiance, fantastic drinks, and an interesting menu.  We already ate at EVO but ordered the yellowtail app at Virtu anyway.  Really fresh, very good.  Ordered a few different drinks.  Had the Seasonal Smash, which is a rye whiskey cocktail, and really enjoyed it.  Got to talking with Clint at the bar and he recommended a Martinez, off the menu, because I love strong old school martini's.  It's the martini before there was a martini.  What a great drink made by a real bartender that actually knows what he's doing.  We also ordered a drink that I think was on the menu called a Penicillin, excellent as well.  It's off the beaten path right by a little hotel of sorts, The Bespoke Inn.  Virtu is across the courtyard off of N. Marshall Way.  Really close to a lot of places we like.  Thought I would get this review in because we were supposed to go to dinner there a couple of weeks back but couldn't.  Booked dinner for tonight.  Of course, we are stopping by the bar beforehand.  I'll post the 2nd review after we grab dinner and drinks there.  Go check it out, it's a great place.

Went back for dinner as I said in my previous review.  Still loved it.  Fantastic food.  Clint made us a couple of cocktails at the bar, great as they were before.  Chris was our server and Geo is the chef.  They fly in scallops that are alive in the shell.  They taste completely different than typical scallops you would order at other restaurants.  Very fresh and flavorful with a nice presentation.  Actually had two of those.  The octopus app was outstanding.  Never had octopus that was that tender.  The papardelle and elk entrees were unbelievable as well.  Everything had a beautiful presentation but most importantly tasted great.  Can't remember the name of the dessert but it was basically vanilla ice cream in a coffee cup with espresso poured over the top.  Interesting, really liked it.  Had a couple of glasses of wine to boot.  It's a cool little place with a nice, yet casual, atmosphere.  It will definitely be incorporated into our rounds of typical places we frequent.  We will be back.

I go out for sushi often and am not afraid to go to a high end place or a dive.  This place had decent atmosphere but is as cold as a brick of ice.  The girl and guy bartenders were as warm and friendly as a pile of rocks.  Are you sick of my analogies yet, ok.  Bottom line,  I ordered sashimi - yellowtail, halibut, tuna, and snow crab.  2 pieces each And completely overpriced as most strip sushi places.  However, not as good as others.  Miso soup and a martini too and those were pretty decent.  They were an hour from closing and were doing everything to get ready, as most of us would do.  I get it, you want to go home.  You have a number of customers still so stay focused and serve the customers and maybe warm up a little so they feel like you appreciate their business.  Won't be back.

Great place.  More of a 41/2.  Came in a couple days ago and had the special of 2 coney dogs and a drink for 8-9 bucks.  Also ordered the loose meat sandwich and chili fries.  Everything was awesome.  The natural soda brand from MI they carried was outstanding stuff too.  Of course, they call it pop.  The owner and staff were super nice guys and we look forward to going back.  They're thinking about opening another location so hopefully it will be in Gilbert near San Tan Mall.  Hint hint.  We live right by there.

Nice clean roomy place.  We had a glass of red and white wine, lamb shank, and lamb kabobs and beef skewer.  The food was good, especially the lamb shank.  The beef skewer was a bit tough.  The white wine was old and stale but they replaced the glass so that worked out.  Will go back.  Server did a nice job too,

Yelp reviews and really the star averages, by and large, are very accurate.  Not in this case.  Going in, we realize we live in the east valley so any seafood is flown in and not typically going to be as good as if you lived by the water on a coast.  So six of us ordered a variety so we didn't put too much pressure on the seafood aspect of their menu alone.  The fried chicken, okra, mac and cheese, steamed clams, fish and chips (anything fried is usually pretty good), cioppino, and drinks.  The steamed clams were overcooked and rubbery.  They also didn't seem fresh to any extent.  The fish and chips had a nice golden breading but no seasoning.  The fried chicken had zero seasoning and frankly the coating fell off in big chunks.  I could live with that if it tasted better.  The other stuff was ok based on what everybody said during dinner.  The consensus was that it was average at best but none of us would rush back.  The server was very nice but the actual service was disjointed.  Didn't offer bread so we asked and she brought bread for only 3 people after we already had apps.  We had to ask again and say that everyone, all 6, wanted a piece of bread.  Getting condiments required us asking 3 or 4 times because we would ask for vinegar, for example, and she would run off before we could state the other items we needed.  If you give someone fish and chips just give them vinegar in case they want some.  I've reviewed 200 or 300 restaurants on Yelp and always try to be fair but this really was disappointing.  The fact that the reviews average at 4 1/2 for this place either tells me that my fellow locals and/or reviewers haven't ventured out much to other places to eat that actually are 4's or above OR maybe they are just delusional.  Either way, go see for yourself and I hope that you have a better experience than the 6 of us did.  The ambiance is fine and it's clean, which is a good start.  The food needed help the evening we went.

More of a 3 1/2 but I'm feeling generous since they just opened.  This is another location of My Wine Cellar and the says MWC so don't let it confuse you.  Same place.  We went Saturday and enjoyed ourselves.  Ordered lettuce wraps with meatballs, Mac n Cheese, and we tried various wines by the glass.  I would say that the meatballs didn't taste homemade and several of us thought the same.  The server did a good job and was attentive.  We have friends that live around the corner and used to go to Wines Down Under often so they will be here all the time.  Good little place but I like Vintage, Postino Arcadia, Terrior, and other places a bit better.  Go check it out.

This place is horrible.  Twice now, gave it a second chance and still bad.  The staff couldn't give a damn about anything.  Asked my name and said Joe, they said Chuck.  Ok, I don't care about that so give me some decent food.  Asked for no cheese since I'm lactose intolerant so I get chicken street tacos and beans and rice with cheese.  Happened the first time too.  Gave food back to the guy to fix, a minute later a girl brings my food up but calls it a different name of a guy that just left, told her it was mine, she didn't say anything just took it away.  The guy tells her it's mine so she turns to me with a nasty look and gives it to me.  Freakin strange.  Owners, get a clue and stop using airport employees.  Hire your own people who give a shit and pay them what they deserve.  The tacos were spicy but lack any other flavor, the beans like glue, and the rice beyond flavorless.  Will not eat here again.

Really liked this place when they were in Scottsdale and we would go in occasionally.  Thought they sold and closed but realized one of the owners reopened in Tempe.  Went in for eggs and bacon and berry waffles.  Also, the mushroom omelet, mimosa, and Americano.  Everything was good.  I think it will get more refined as they work out the kinks.  The staff is great and look forward to going back.

The locations in Scottsdale and Las Vegas are better period.  4 of us ordered a meat and cheese board, trout, 2 fried chicken dishes, a sandwich (can't remember) and some drinks.  The chicken was good not great.  It's been great at the other locations.  The server brought our first round and it took 20 minutes for a couple of old fashioned's, a manhattan and beers.  We told the server that we would appreciate light on the simple syrup because we don't care for sweet cocktails.  We want to taste the whiskey.  They were still too sweet.  Asked again and brought us manhattans instead old fashioned's.  Tried to tell us that they were the correct drink. He was maybe young 20's and barely knew what each drink was made with.  Trust me we were given the wrong drinks.  The trout was disgusting and excessively salty.  Told the server and figured he would get a manger or take it off the bill.  Guess what, neither happened.  He asked if we wanted a box for it and we repeated its gross and salty.  Brought us the bill and we said fuck it.  We had plans and tickets so we left.  Disappointing experience.  Won't come back here.

Let me cut to the chase.  This place sucks!  When they closed the Power and Queen Creek location figured this location would be the same.  It's just down the street.  Not at all.  We ordered a number of times and it's just well below average.  Last night ordered two pizzas and one had no cheese.  We get the delivery and no cheese and also no freakin sauce.  Basically, cardboard with toppings.  Called and they connected me to manager and he said he'd get another one out. Get that and at the door looked in the box to find the exact same thing.  No sauce.  Seriously, who's in the kitchen the three stooges.  Told the guy to take it back and tell the manager.  Never heard anything, no call and so no reason to ever spend another dollar at Barros at any location.

Been here 3 or 4 times and really like the place.  Nice ambiance, very good food, above average cocktails and nice wines by the glass.  We've tried the pork shank app, deviled eggs, short rib entree, halibut and crab cake to name a few items.  Loved everything except the crab cake.  The one thing that I think needs attention is the one man band situation.  The place is good size, high ceilings and sound really travels.  The one man guitar is fine and has a more mellow feel.  The one man r and b and pop music on Saturday is way way too loud guys.  Heard this twice, everybody around us was wincing.  It's just too freakin loud.  Somebody said "well it's a bar".  It's not s dive bar.  It's a tapas or small plate joint, maybe a tapas and wine bar.  Therefore, play whatever music you want but not so loud.  You can barely hear each other.  That being said, I like the place and we will be back.  Great servers as well.

Great little place.  We ordered the fish ceviche, clam strips, cod tacos, and carnitas tacos.  A couple of beers and a sangria as well.  Park in the back and sit outside on the patio.  The service was consistent and above average.  We go to The Farmhouse, across the street, for breakfast all the time.  This place is family owned and has fresh seafood.  Where the hell else are you going to find that anywhere near Gilbert.  All of the food was very good.  We wanted to try a variety since it was our first visit.  The ceviche was tasty but if I'm being super picky it could use a little more seasoning.  I eat ceviche frequently in CA.  Bottomline, good service, good food, seafood from a local joint, and family owned. What more do we all need.

Don't waste your time.  Stopped in to try it out because I love breakfast joints.  Stood at the counter for several minutes with the server standing 5 feet away talking to a vendor of some kind, after a few minutes she looked with her finger up as to say just wait and when I'm done talking to this guy I'll ask you if you want something.  Strangest thing ever.  I walked a couple doors down to New Mexico grill, ordered a breakfast burrito and we eating in 5 minutes.  This place is pretty small so the server saw me, the hostess saw me and the whole kitchen saw me.  Nobody lifted a finger.  Won't ever spend a dime there.
