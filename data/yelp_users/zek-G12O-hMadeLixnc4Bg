I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is not even a sushi place but it pretty much has the best sushi around for around 8 dollars and I always second think about buying a small sized 8 dollar salad and then I eat it and it does not disappoint with how fresh and delicious everything is. BEST DESSERTS, CUTE STORE! LOVE!!!!!!!!!!

I waited 20 minutes and got quoted 40 dollars in the mall and they gave my watch back and said try it and make sure it is battery and sent me home with nothing! I walked in here and before I could even blink had a new battery for 5 dollars and got shown a beatiful Coach watch for under 100 dollars! If I was a coach fan I would have snagged it up in a heartbeat!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU LOCAL AZ! I WILL BE BACK! and hopefully someone snags that watch!

We went because we had a coupon for buy one get one free, which was for a nine dollar value. I had the sampler, the boyfriend had the veal. Let me say that it started off with some of the best foccacia bread we have ever had and a salad with chickpeas and the best homemade creamy italian. Everyone in the restaurant was very nice and greeted us immediately. It was around 9 pm so we were there with only another table who knew the owners that were there. As far as our meals, they were fantastic! The sauces and noodles were perfect, the best we have found in town and especially in the north valley. We will definetely go back and cannot wait to try the cannoli next time.

We visited this restuarant on a saturday night, which it was empty, and we used the travelzoo coupon for a three course meal for 40 dollars. This was a great deal since we got two appetizers, two entrees and two desserts but it was way too much food for two people and the coupon was maxed out at about 90 dollars although the total of our food only came to around 65 bucks so it was odd that we had to tip on that amount. The young women who was our waitress was lucky she got a tip at all, she gave us was the worst service we had ever had. First, she was dressed ridicuolously innapropriate for the ambience in a school girl skirt and t shirt, she took our coupon rudely made a face and never asked us for drinks or came back to our table for that matter. she took our order after being impatient and then all the hosts brought our food out, she never asked us for fresh cheese which was offered to other tables. We were so thirsty and she never offered us anything besides the wine which was included, we didn;t drink it but she refused to get us anything else and then dessert came and another host asked us what we wanted. I would have understood if it was busy but we watched her flirt with the bartender all night and then had to over tip her on our price of food, my boyfriend wanted to walk out. I know we had a good deal and the food came out looking lovely. The food and presentation were good but I prefer more authentic italian food but I could never recommend it due to this experience. On another note, all the other workers were lovely.

I am so sad because my husband went in for a specific haircut, a classic pompadour, he always goes to a barber and was very hesitant to go here. We only went because it was Sunday and the barber was closed. He had been growing his hair for 5 months and was told by the woman that she COULD NOT cut his hair the way that he wanted even though it was already cut that way and he only needed a trim. He gave up fighting with her and watched her cut all of his hair off because she did not know how to cut his hair. He now has a military style cut which I am sure is one of probably four haircuts that the stylist probably knew. I was very upset with the lack of experience and creativity and we will never be back here.

This review is only on the food. The atmosphere was great and the health store looked cute but I did not spend time looking around. It was my first time there so I got fresh squeezed orange juice and a crab omelette. My friend got the portabello mushroom burger. For spending 15 dollars and the place was packed, I was excited for my breakfast. The waitress was lovely and I will will probably try it again because the people were very friendly. Getting to the point, my omelette was okay but nothing special and pretty small compared to most breakfast places. The potatoes looked beautiful but they came out very mushy actually all the potatoes were super mushy like frozen and microwaved tasting so it was disappointing. My friends mushroom was under cooked and the avocado was way under ripe so overall we were all disappointed with our food. I would expect some fresh food in a health market but nothing was very appetizing. I may go back to check out the market but for the price will not do the food again.

I really wanted to like this place since I have watched them on facebook with all their delicious looking desserts but that is all I can say was worth it. I tried the blueberry pie and it was very good. Now for my experience, we waited 45 minutes for our food in am empty restaurant which consisted of pancakes the circumference of my coffee cup and some eggs for 10 dollars. We really liked the biscuits and gravy and also the rosemary potatoes were good but the quantity of food was not at all worth it for the price. I was told that it is inconsistent so perhaps we went on a bad day but we will not come back with all the yummy breakfast places in Phoenix.
