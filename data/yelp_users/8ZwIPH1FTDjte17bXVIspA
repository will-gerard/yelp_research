Two words: soggy pizza.  Service is the only reason I am giving two stars instead of one.

Great food, very friendly service.  We will definitely be back.  I had the prickly pear chicken sandwich with fries.  I'm thinkin' it was a good choice but my husband had a chicken parm sandwich that looked pretty good as well.  (It must have been good because he never even offered me a bite!)  Very casual atmosphere, with football on the TVs.  Seems like a good place to catch a game while eating tasty food.

What a great hidden gem.  Tucked away in a corner of an otherwise uninspiring strip mall in Tempe, Classic Italian Pizza is my new fave pizza place.  Right away, you walk into another world as you step inside.  Cozy and warm, you would have no idea that you were in a strip mall at all.  But the real reason to drive out to Classic Italian Pizza is the pizza itself.  Try it, you can thank me later.

Joel and his entire staff are great.  I appreciate their honesty, especially since I have found it to be so rare among mechanics I've dealt with at other shops, particularly at dealerships.  Well, do yourself a favor and skip the dealer and go directly to AZ Import Specialists.  They are reasonably priced, they will not rip you off and they will explain exactly what the car needs and allow you to make the decisions.   My car is running perfectly.   I will just finish by saying that Joel just saved me a small fortune because I decided to get a second opinion after receiving a ridiculously high quote for repair work at Earnhardt Nissan (Superstition Springs area in Mesa.)

Been here three times now and loved it every time.  We ordered the chips and salsa as an appetizer and were glad we did.  Great chips and the tomatillo/avocado salsa was perfect.  I also really enjoyed the bean dip.  I have ordered both the shrimp and tilapia tostadas and the Chicken Rojo and would highly recommend either.  Service was the right  combination of friendly and efficient and they played good music, old time-y style country (don't worry, for those of you not into country, it wasn't too loud.)  Nice lighting, nice atmosphere.  We think we're pretty lucky to have a place like the Spotted Donkey Cantina in our neighborhood.  Stop by and you will see why.      PS: They have nice outdoor seating as well.

Awful.  Pizza was disgusting (we ordered the thin crust.)  I've had better frozen pizza.  In fact, this might have been the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of having.  I can't imagine why people rave about this place, or why they actually wait for it.  I came here expecting the pizza to be amazing.  It was, just not in a positive way.  Never again.  What a mistake.

I was very excited to find this place as you will be when you walk inside and find nice clothes and accessories for even nicer prices!  There are several locations throughout the (east) valley.  Treat yourself.  You will be happy you did.

Gilbert is cool.  Yeah, that's right, I said it.  Gilbert is the coolest town in the valley and this is one of the places that makes it so darn cool.  The atmosphere here is perfect for hanging out and relaxing with a hot cup of coffee or, better still, a cup of cowboy cocoa.  Be sure to also check out the restaurant next door, Joe's Farm Grill.  Another amazingly cool place to hang out and enjoy great comfort food in a friendly setting.

Bunna coffee is my local coffee house.  The owners are lovely, the coffee is tasty and served beautifully in wonderful big mugs, and the food and service are always and dependably great too.  Despite it being housed in a strip mall (and what isn't in the valley, right?) the ambiance here is charming and I generally linger longer than necessary due to the relaxed feeling I get while sipping my yummy espresso drinks.  Also, the coffee is fair trade, which makes it worth 5 stars.

I love this little gem.  The owner is a lovely Afghani man who is friendly and helpful.  This was important because he made many wonderful suggestions to us, the uninitiated.  The Morgh Challow (which is a chicken curry style dish with rice )is the best thing on the menu, although the Mantwo is my husband's favorite.    If you have never tried Afghani, then you are missing out, and if you have, ben have missed Kabab Palace, then you are missing out as well.  I promise that both the service and the food will leave you smiling.  I have been there both for the lunch buffet, which was excellent (my husband kept going back, which was embarrassing to me but tells you something about the food) and the dinner.  I would recommend either, although the lunch buffet would be a better way to try Afghani food for the first time, as you can try a bit of everything and find what you like best.

My husband and I enjoyed some cookies here and will have to come back for lunch.  What a cute place in the Borgata in Scottsdale.

A great find.  One of our new favorites, the Santa Fe style food here is some of the best to be found in the valley.  The atmosphere inside is quite charming and our server was attentive and friendly.  Highly recommended.

We had to have our old dog euthanized and the vet (don't know his name, unfortunately) was so kind and gentle with all of us.   He handled the situation with class and grace.  I would give them 5 stars, but, again, they were a bit overpriced.  However, for this, it was worth it.

So glad to have found this little gem.  Best quiche I have ever had.  The texture and flavor were incredible.  They use only egg yolks and the eggs are fresh from local chickens, not the store bought variety.    The fries and all of the sauces are sinfully good (amazing really) and the service was friendly and efficient.  I am definitely going back and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys superior food and service in a casual atmosphere.

Bryan's is another new favorite.  I have now tried the chili and the chicken and found both to be excellent.  (Make sure to get the full order of chili, which comes with some incredibly delicious toast that is worth the extra time on the stair master.)  Their chili is a unique, black eyed pea and brisket chili and I absolutely loved the flavor.  It's got a bit of heat but nothing that most of us "youngsters" can't handle.  (My husband and I have found that we are some of the youngest people around our area of Carefree and not only does it not bother us, we're loving it, feeling like 40 year old "spring chickens," haha.  Next time you are in the area, make sure to stop by Bryan's.  Great, quick service, atmosphere and food make it a good choice when you're in the mood for BBQ.

This place is a find.  A gem tucked away in a strip mall in NE Mesa.  If you are in the mood for some good mexican food at good prices, come on down.  My husband and I each had different burritos and both were excellent, with great salsas too.  The flour tortillas were so fresh and like someone else mentioned, the food wasn't greasy.  This is quality food in a very casual atmosphere.  If you are in a hurry, I noticed that they have drive through too.  Definitely worth a try, especially if you are in the neighborhood.

I recently discovered this gem in Cave Creek.  The coffee is excellent, atmosphere is warm and inviting and the service is friendly.  I wouldn't dream of asking for more, but there is more.  They also serve food and judging from the delicious sandwich I had (a ham and swiss on multi grain, grilled, of the "build your own" variety), I will be back for more as soon as I make it out to Cave Creek again.  The patio area is a lovely place to enjoy the sun in a true desert setting.  We enjoyed watching birds (Cardinals, Cactus Wrens, etc) and also got to meet the owner's dog, a sweet and laid back afghan strongly resembling a stuffed animal.
