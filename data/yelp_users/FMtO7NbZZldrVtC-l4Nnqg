Im not sure why this place was featured on Diners, Dives and Drive-ins. Its not that great.  The chicken pad thai is pretty decent, but I have had better.  My second trip here was not great at all.  Came in and it wasn't crammed packed like the first time, so that was nice but the service was horrible.  My friend and I sat and waited as we watched the tables clear out one by one and no food came out.  I had to flag the waitress down twice before she would even respond as to why we had been waiting for 1/2 hour at this point for our food. It was a piss poor excuse and they weren't that apologetic.  We finally got our food  45 minutes into my hour lunch and it wasn't as good as the first time.  Pad thai was barely warm enough to eat.  If you want chili paste brought to your table.... an additional .50 cents.  WTF?  There prices are high enough to compensate the making of chili paste dry or wet.  I don't know if I will come back here.  I would rather drive down the road a few miles and go somewhere else.  Sadly.

I have been coming here for a couple years and love coming here. My food is never wrong, always have great service and also like it that my favorite server Jennifer is still there! She knows what I like and what my usuals are. Never are they busy enough to where you get ignored even at lunch time. Small little bar counter that you can watch football (oh yeah I love football!!!woot woot) or something dumb. Hahaha.  Gourmet pizzas are pretty good too. Love the BBQ chicken one minus mushrooms of course. Its the bomb on thin crust. All in all good place to go for lunch for sure.

Our office recently moved to the Glendale area and this place is a hidden gem!!!  The owners and staff are super nice.  We let them know it was out first time in and we were able to sample some extremely awesome split pea soup.  Nothing like I have ever tasted. :)  I ordered the Gyro lunch special... Holy cow it was sooooo good!!!  The French fries are cut and made fresh, which makes the meal even better.  No ketchup needed on those babies!!!  I also had a greek side salad.  They made it special and charges a little more, but, again it was well worth it.  The dressing was superb!  The grape leaves were amazing as well.  Very good blend of flavor.  So different from what I have had in the past as well, but a pleasant surprise all the way around.  This will be a regular place for myself and co-workers!  We had a fabulous lunch today!  I usually comment on the bathrooms when I do a review, but did not enter one today...  hopefully its not disappointing. lol  Thanks for reading.......

I have been coming here since I was 15 years old and it is amazing how much their food has not changed and in my opinion that is amazing.  Anyone who has lived in this are knows this is a solid place to eat!!  Their chips and salsa ROCK!!!  Their shredded beef tacos,  chimis, and anything else that has the shredded beef is amazing.  So tender and juicy with great seasonings.  Good service, nothing super fancy either, just a great place to eat if you want Mexican food.  Decent pricing and good lunch specials.  I have no preference as to what would be better than something on the menu.  I have tried just about everything and nothing is bad.  My favorites are the chimichangas, chicken or beef.  Either one is great.  If you are in the area and want a place to eat, try this!! I don't think you will be disappointed :)

This is a pretty good place to eat.  Plus they have this little mini bar area too, but I do mean mini.    My favorite,  or at least one of them is the super nachos minus the nacho cheese sauce and replaced with real cheddar cheese.  AWESOMMMMME. The chicken or shredded beef are both tasty.   It's always quiet,  no lines or long wait for your food.  They have a TV that is usually playing sports recaps or something so that's nice too.  The staff will do anything to make your food the way you asked for it and don't mind changing something small to accommodate.

I really like this Sprouts.  They just renovated and moved things around, but it is much more spacious and easier to see everything when you walk in.  Lines are always short and if they look long, someone will open up another register, so that is nice.  Gotta try the little sandwich/soup lunch market.  Their sandwiches are cheap and tastes like your mom made it.  Sooooo good.  I would suggest trying their chicken salad.  Great flavor and super fresh!!!

This is a great healthy alternative to burgers or anything deep fried in this area.   Never too busy nor do you wait long for your food. You can see what is being cooked as well, so no funny business going on with your food :)  Owners actually work there and they care about their customers.   I will always come here :)

Not pleased with this branch at all. :/ I see no logic in telling me I can't use checks I am cashing to get a cashiers check when I am an account holder.  BUT..... I can cash those checks come back and they would issue me one? Fucking stupid! !!!! How is that logical? All they did is piss me off to the point I won't come to this branch.  I seriously want to walk back in and get a money order with the teller right next to the other guy.  Grrrrrrrrrr.

We like this movie theater.  It's always clean and never crowded.  Movie prices suck of courseBut if you go before noon is not to bad.  Get the cup I'd you come more than twice.  It's worth it.

Staff here are ALWAYS helpful.  I have been coming here for about 5 years now.  Staff has basically been the same and always someone who is actually willing to help you and answer questions.... no matter what.  You are important to them - at least that is the feel I get.  But, they do know me as I shop there a lot.  Nice office max though.

hahahaha I should've read the reviews prior but as I telling  someone else, I at my standards pretty low so I wasn't surprised to see my truck at completion.  It could be better.  I'll be re-cleaning the grill and interior myself tomorrow. I'm pretty picky I guess. dried bugs left on after a wash is unacceptable.  I laughed inside as I saw the two girls "clean" and dry. for the amount of times they passed over an area you would think it would've looked brand new.  Not.  Anyhow, at least nothing for stolen and the staff was nice regardless of the quality of service.

I was not impressed with this place.  However the staff was very nice and i didn't have to wait long for my order. . I ordered the pad thai chicken for lunch.  Price was ok but the meal itself wasn't.  Barely any sauce,  no flavor. Too many bean sprouts too...I'm thinking the deep fried tofu they put in it was to replace having to use more chicken?  Whatever the reason, it didn't make it any better.   I've eaten a lot of thai food and this just didn't do it for me.  May try once more but not positive. Depending on how hungry I am.  Thanks for reading :)

The past office itself is okay but some of the employees there are morons. I hate having to interact with them.  Why after 6 years would you ask a regular customer whom you know by name for id and make you sign back of your cc? It makes no sense and is irritating.

This place was nice.  Food had good flavor good atmosphere as well.  Didn't try the tacos. Had a burrito.  I don't think it was worth 14 though.  Close but not quite.  Black beans are awesome.   Tried the white peach and hibiscus marg. GROSS. Tasted like I was drinking a flower.  Waaaaay to much hibiscus not enough white peach.  Took a while to get the flower taste out of my mouth.

I've had issues here but they do try to make it right.  Bring a lot of company trucks here so they do know I am a repeat customer.  Some employees have been here for a long time which is nice.  Never had anything stolen either and that should give them 5 stars lol!

Super disappointed!!!! Got a pedi before heading to Disneyland and was not happy at all!  Only a few employees in the place, the lady I got looked like she hopped out of bed and forgot to brush her hair...   Nail tech specifically asked if I wanted my nails short or longer and then cut them the exact opposite!  Super short. Grrrr #1  Paint job was crap!  More upset about this than anything - Bubbles on my toes, polish on my toes that wasn't cleaned off, color uneven so you can see through on spots, between the fricking bubbles! Still see white on the tips of my toes where she didn't get polish on.... Grrr #2  Had to literally pick off pieces of skin that was clipped..Really??? Grrr #3  Now I have to go spend more money somewhere else to get a re-polish Grrr #4.  Won't go back here!  I absolutely could have done better myself and saved the $20 bucks.

Even though this place is crazy busy all the time I do like the customer svc reps.  I've been coming here for a while and there are some individuals that stand out.  Polly for one. She is so nice.  Hopefully you will get lucky and end up with her.   Charles is awesome but moved to the Goodyear location

Follow up from my pre purchase of a detail...so I finally went back and even though I had to pre remind the manager about the numerous bad reviews about this car wash and I was taking a chance, I would say they have redeemed themselves.  My truck looked great!  Everything inside was cleaned as promised.  Nothing was missing (well I did take my change, etc out BEFORE - why temp anyone?  If you don't want it stolen, then take it with you before you leave your vehicle)  One more thing...if you paid for the detail of the inside of your vehicle, don't expect miracles and perfection on the outside.  It wasn't anything special but I didn't pay for it, so I wasn't disappointed.  I am please and will take my vehicle here again. :)

I would like to start off with my very first trip here about a month ago was absolutely delightful!!!  Their antipasto salad was amazing!!!  Now... to this current visit.  I ordered the same exact thing and to be honest, I am getting disappointed in the "special balsalmic" dressing that they make.  It has SO MUCH THICK OIL than anything else, it leaves your salad DRENCHED in oil and that's what you taste.  It ruins it!!! You end up blotting your salad to soak up the excess oil.  It makes the lettuce soggy quickly.  (this same exact thing happened at the Surprise location as well.....so it is disappointing)  We asked the waitress who walked by our table and she clarified on the ingredient ratio for oil to vinegar and I think they need to rethink that OR be consistent and have 1 person make the stuff. Seriously. Consistency is the key.  I showed her my salad and poured out on a plate as to what actually my "dressing" looked like.  She agreed it didn't look good either.  She was nice enough to offer me another salad, but I ate the one I had, so instead gave me a free lunch because I was unhappy about spending 10 dollars on my meal that half of it tasted like I was eating an oil sponge....     She then proceeded to tell me that I should ask for a spoon the next time and have the dressing on the side so I could take out what oil I didn't want.  What the heck???? If I have to do that, what is the point of paying for it?  May as well eat a salad at home with my own dressing that I DON'T have to mess with or alter, right?  So, in my opinion if you are a salad lover and want to try their salads... don't get the balsalmic dressing.  Go for ranch.  You are safe with that.  I am a fan of the pizza there.  It is tasty.  I love the Big Kahuna!!!  Also, I will have to say, they do care about their customer satisfaction, which is great and they don't get defensive about any issues customers have so I gave them 4 stars for that alone.  Thanks for reading.....

I agree with everyone's reviews.  Even the drive through is slow.  It isn't the greatest location but I do have hopes that they plan to upgrade the location.  There isn't many choices in buckeye for food add it is

Normally my co worker and I go to this place because its close to our office.  BUT my girl is gone (Kelly) and they may have new owners or something, because they are not the same people.  The gal I had was not very attentive.  She did not listen to one word I said to her and basically did what the "eff" she wanted with my pedi.  Grrrrrrr!  She immediately started mowing my toenails down like I had talons.  Never even asked how I like my toes.  I can't believe I am saying this either, but the massage was pure torture.  I didn't think it was possible for someone to make a massage on your feet painful, but she absolutely managed to get it done...Ouch.  Even my friend was laughing watching her.  The polish step was even worse.  she was more irritated at me trying to get her to understand that my polish needing fixing on a couple toes...  Then to top it off, I gave her a $10 for some change to tip her (very sparingly due to service) and she purposely brought back two 5 dollar bills.    Im hesitant on even going back there if the same techs work there.....  dang.  ***Just looked over and saw Carmen W. post.  I like her post too!

Very cool place!  Took son here by a recommendation for a lip piercing.  I loved the shop décor!  Very obvious owner is a Rob Zombie fan.  Shop was very clean, and sterile - I would have walked out otherwise.  Staff was real nice and answered any and all questions.  My son was very happy even though we had to come back and get the piercing removed two weeks later (he didn't like it afterall....)  I would definitely like to come back for a tattoo!

This is a quick place to go when you need your nails done in Buckeye.  Average price for a pedi, which is the only thing I usually get.  The shop is clean, relaxing and the nail techs are very nice.  I like to go in and relax and not chit chat with them.  And they don't.  They just do their thing and move on.  I will return to this place :)

This place is GREAT!  Been coming here since they opened.  Staff is super friendly and food is wonderful.  The only suggestion I have is that if you want a medium spicy then, have them put it on the side and you can add as needed.  Their homemade sweet and sour sauce it AMAZING that comes with their spring rolls, which, by the way are amazing as well!  Love those little suckers...lol  Otherwise, everything I have tried on the menu has been very good.  If its not, then they will make it right.  Nice place to go for lunch, etc.  Small dining area, but it makes it kind of cozy.

This is a great place to eat that is inexpensive and won't break the bank.  Boars head meats are a plus as well.  They even carry thrifty ice cream! !!! YUM!  good comes out fast with minimal wait.    Iced tea is amazing.  Best place in a long time to have such great tea.  I'm a fan!   The staff are pleasant as well.  Super friendly :)  This will be a good go to place for me for sure.

thank goodness for this place.  my son went from Ulta to here. I've saved tons lol.... I will have to say one irritating thing and this is also coming from a 16 year old. .. hairdressers -FYI... it's SUPER  rude to chew and smack on gum when you are cutting hair.  no one wants to hear that while they're  getting their hair done.  just sayin

Was next door at the surgery center and needed breakfast bad.  Since it was the crack of dawn the place was empty however that didn't stop the great service I got.  Cashier was so nice!  Had a smile on her face the whole time and have me good recommendation for what I was looking for to eat.  That's nice.  Ordered a breakfast burrito that was AWESOMMMMME.  I also had a Carmel iced coffee and that was great as well. I was worried due to the other reviews and glad it was yummy.  It's not called Donna s any longer.  Boba subs or something like that.  Nevertheless I would come here again.

Oh My Gosh!!! This place was soooooooo disgusting!!  First of all to pay 11+ for a 6" sub and French fries, was highway robbery.  Just sayin  I have a hard time believing some of the reviews for this place.  I don't see how you could like their so called Italian even remotely good.  You must have never had a sub sandwich in your life.  On the board the sandwich ingredients included, your regular meats, ham, cappicola, salami, etc etc.   The sub I got included the following.... black forest ham (maybe?? - it honestly tasted like store bought store brand ham) and COTTO SALAMI!!! It was so thick that is all you tasted.  I will never go back and eat here.  As my friend and I were waiting for our food, we thought what a great time to try a slice of pizza as their special was .99 for a slice.  We asked the girl at the counter,( who, by the way also had her two children at the counter as well....weird, yes.) for a slice and she said.... oh, we don't have any...  HUH?    It was not a good experience.... DO NOT GO HERE...IT SUCKS!!!!.  There are other places for desperation food for a lot less in walking distance than to enter here.   this is one of those places that you could definitely earn the Maverick badge.... hahaha  Thanks for reading.

This is a great Bealls Outlet!  I have been to a few around the valley and this is one of my favorites.  Lots of clothing for kids /women / men.  This has been my go to store for the holidays when I buy my toddler grandchild clothes - high quality name brand for a lot cheaper!  Jeans, Jeans, Jeans - if you can't find yourself a pair here, there is something wrong!!! Another great place to find that special pair ;)  The staff here are ALWAYS nice!!! They will hold stuff for you, help you find something, etc. etc.  Very pleased with this place!  Very clean, well organized, dressing rooms clean, GREAT clearance racks too!

This  is a tiny place downtown but very quaint. Nice atmosphere as well. My friend and  I came here for lunch as we were craving pho and thought we would try this place out.  Waiter was nice and had a great smile. We got the menu and it was pretty small but it seemed to have enough on the menu. lots of spring roll options. Too many too remember. However after looking at the prices for just one, my friend and I decided to pass as we would have been looking at $20 for lunch, which sucks. lol The Pho was GREAT. It had good flavor  and after a little siracha etc., it was even better!  Again it was a little costly...$11!  I did like the place but will try to find somewhere near for better  priced lunch specials. I will come back though.
