Some people may call me an a$$ hole, some may call me intelligent, some say I'm a talker.  Some people call me a Space Cowboy, Some people call me Maurice... whooot whooo.  I for one, like to call my self a Gyro Connoisseur.  I have been to almost every Gyro joint in AZ.  Not to mention quite a few in NYC and Boston.  This is hands down, with out a doubt, the greatest Mediterranean restaurant in AZ.  If you have tried a Gyro and thought it was too greasy and tasted like an over salted soggy strip of beef jerky.  You were probably right, because that is how most places destroy the savory goodness of which is known as Gyro meet.  You need to muster up every bit of strenth to try and forget the past and indulge yourself by trying the Gyro House's perfected adaptation of the Gyro.    The portions are very generous, which is pretty standard for most Greek places.  Although,the fact that it is run by a small friendly family of true Greek's, and not some hokey white dude with a crew of hispanics running the kitchen.  Brings a warm sense of family comfort that you can feel when you walk in, but you can taste as well.    The fresh baklava is always available and reasonably priced.  Not to mention, home made!    Thankfully, the hole in the wall, all you can eat BBQ place closed down next door, and they took over the bigger corner suite.  There is more room to sit and relax in the new space, which is nice.  There was nothing worse than looking forward to a nice big Greek Salad w/ gyro meat for lunch and realizing that all the tables were taken up by the loyal lunch crowd that used to pack into the old place every day around noon.

I think the other reviews are a bit un realistic in terms of what to expect from a fish house in the middle of a desert!  For what its worth, this place isn't bad at all. The big sign out front that read 4.99 lunch, sparked my intrest like a shiney quarter on the floor of a video arcade when I was 8 years old.   When we came in the server never really pointed out that the lunch menu with the 4.99 price point was tucked away behind the condiments.  Outta sight outta mind at its finest. The sandwich I had was tasty. The shrimp was fresh, and the salad was crisp. The service was very good, not overly anxious yet punctual.  For decor, I give it a 6 star. I dig the warm,  inviting feeling you get from the cultured stone and light to dark tinted woods that adorn the walls. It doesn't feel like your typical cookie cutter corporate dining establishment that you can find anywhere in az.

Hands down, the worst dining experience I have ever had. Food is FAIR. Nothing to write home about. Big Buddah across the way on Greenway and 303 is a much better choice. The service is absolutely horrific. The fire alarms went off as we were eating. The minimal English speaking wait staff never came close to anything remotely close to an apology or sympathetic response to having to endear 35 minutes of constant ear piercing screeching from the fire alarms. I understand not being able to control the fire alarms going off. But what you can control is the way you take care of your customers after the fact. I wasn't looking for a freebie dinner, maybe simply an apologetic side bar conversation about how unfortunate the circumstances were... that would have been fine with me. This is a typical hole in the wall Chinese joint that over charges on the meals that you can get at an all you can eat buffet. They think they are providing great service, but they are really just flat out annoying when they constantly swarm over the table and stare at you from across the room. I guess they have nothing better to do when there is usually only 4 people in the place at the highest point in their dinner rush.

I wanted sooooo bad to like this place.  I've given them "another chance" over and over again.  Finally, I've just given up.  The food is OK.  The drink specials and pricing isn't anything to brag about.  I live close by, and I was looking forward to calling "my bar".  Too bad the management and employees don't care if you like them or not.    The first time I visited, we came in for apps and drinks.  Overpriced, Super long waits for food and real stuck up and snobby waitresses.    Couple months later, brought a friend from out of town in for a drink and dinner.  The burgers were burnt and wouldn't you know it.... the waitress was rude and forgetful.  Few months later.. tried them again.  Silly me!  Took 45 minutes for them to bring out our quesadilla.  Never once did ANYONE ever come over to let us know there was a delay or appologize for the wait.  2 minutes after they brought out the quesadilla they brought out our food.  Who does that?  I tried to explain to them that this was bad form.  Now we need to try to eat our app while eating our main course.  I know this isn't the 5 star Capitol Grille, but its just common sence!  I asked to speak with a manager.  The "manager" said, (I kid you not) " I dont understand, we brought you the food... what do you mean it came out together?  It's your fault you didn't tell your waited you wanted it before your meal" ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? Its my fault??? Needless to say... We left and have never been back.  SQUID INK across the street has much better drink specials and happy hour apps.     Side note... for some reason this seems to be D0uCh3 Bag central.. Every roided out, loser wearing an Affliction shirt and sparkled jeans seems to hang out there.
