I am very disappointed with this. My mom and sister and I have been going here for years and they have been awful in the last year or two. I went in for a regular checkup which is covered by my insurance but I asked the doctor a few questions (QUESTIONS) that sparked a 2 minute discussion and I was billed $100 for it.  Then I was prescribed birth control and I can only get it one month at a time for nuvaring. They have 3 month  options but they won't sign off on it... And then without notifying me, they wouldn't refill it. So when I was due to start it back up on week 1 the pharmacy wouldn't give it to me because my doctor wouldn't authorize it until I came in for another appointment. This is ridiculous. You should give me a couple weeks notice if I am really needed in for an appointment (just so you can collect another check for an office visit)  Lastly, I was given a false negative on my pap smear because they messed up but made sure to charge me $300 for their mistake in making me take further tests but guess what?! I'm perfectly healthy! Shocker. They will do whatever they can to get money from you and inconvenience your life. I'm very disappointed with them.

I was looking around lost and confused and Patrick asked me what he could do to help me. He listened to my project and walked me through my options and how we could cut the wood to be most effective. He was so helpful and patient and completely made my day!! I am so grateful for Patrick and his help and wisdom! Thank you! What a great experience

I've been with them since I left my pediatric doctor and I could not be happier. Doctor Gannon is the best doctor I have ever had and every visit is informative, helpful, and he doesn't try and rush me out. He answers all my questions without charging me an arm and a leg like other doctors do. He and his assistant get my medications out quickly and it is a painless process for me. I would recommend him to ANY ONE! His staff has always been very nice to me as well.

The food here is fantastic. I will just say the wait is usually pretty long. We call in and order our food and it's always 30-35 minutes out and even then we sometimes have to wait. We just love the food so much we keep coming back. Staff is nice but expect a little bit of a wait when you go.

I had my son in January of '13 and went here for my appointments/check-ups/etc. They were kind, polite, happy, sweet and overall AMAZING. So when I was fed up with my prior OB/GYN for typical wellness things, I decided to call them. The receptionist was so kind and didn't make me feel awkward for explaining my concerns with my body. She got me in for an appointment that worked very well for me and I'm excited to have them as my primary OB/GYN from now on and especially for my future babies!

Honestly I loved Doctor Werther. He was always SO good to my son and I. He answered all my questions and didn't question my concerns. He was patient and kind and thorough. We saw him at the Val Vista and baseline office and my son lived seeing his puppy. I am very grateful for Doctor Werther and all his help easing a new mother's mind. I'm sad to see negative reviews because of how good he was to us. Thank you Doctor Werther for all your help and patience!
