Horrible!  I am not sure when it happened, sometime before Groupon and Living Social started selling discount coupons but this place has gone so far downhill.  I use to go and even pay full price and they took time and everything was nice.  As of a couple of years ago I would notice they didn't wipe the back windows on the inside or there would be water spots, or the vacuuming was shotty.  As of late, and I am only going until I use the last of my groupons, the man at check in is rude as can be and so pushy.  Today he starts off with you don't want greasy Armor All do you?  Don't you want to upgrade to a leather cleaner.  Why would he say that what his company uses as standard is greasy and crummy?  He then asks if I am sure I want to stay because there is a 45 minute to hour wait.  I tell him yes.  When I open my door to get out he again says, "I can't believe you want them to put Armor All on your doors.  They are dirty and need a detail"  Anyway, one more trip and I will never be back again.  The truck was minimally vacuumed, still had gum wrappers in the doors, and it was even dripping water when he drove it to me.  Pathetic to say the least and this was a $26 wash at full rate.

Went to this place based on Yelp reviews. I was very impressed with each person that I met who were good to explain the process. I did not end up getting surgery but felt I was given good information to make am informed decision.

I have an oversized sliding door and needed the screen replaced. I was able to drop it off with Deb and pick it up 30 min.later. she was very kind and the price was extremely fair.

Cute place.  Food is good.  It is a bit far from my home so don't expect i will go again.  Flavor was good but shrimp were over cooked.

Today I sold my second car to CarMax.  They gave me a bit more than KBB which I was happily surprised about.  I worked with Ian and Twyler.  They made the process very easy and smooth.  I am very happy with their service and will certainly consider buying from them in the future.

I have been going to Goodman Dental Center for many years.  When you walk in and see Suzie's smiling face and she calls you and all your children by name you feel very welcome.  Linda, who is currently away, makes you feel the same!  The dental hygienists are very nice and friendly and Dr. Brian is awesome.  I recommend them to all my clients that move to the area.  Although gong to the dentist is a favorite activity, I actually look forward to seeing everyone and feel I am taken well care of.

I love this store.  There is so much to choose from.  When I want a job done I look at what is on sale and there is usually something appealing and at a great price.  If I buy too much they take it back.  So grateful to see their displays for great ideas.

I really enjoy this place.  The atmosphere is the best, the food is great and the staff is wonderful.  Thanks to Phillip last night who was a wonderful server.  Only had bad service once.  They keep the patio temperature great no matter what time of years.  Great for special occasions.

Stopped in for dinner one night and didn't like the atmosphere but came back for a breakfast and was happily surprised.  Food tasted great and liked the TV on the wall.

I had laser removal done several years ago at another place and each time I went I could see a difference in my hair growth.  I also broke out in hives which was not good but it did rid me of unwanted hair.  I have been to Simplicity twice and although I didn't get hives I have seen NO difference in hair growth.  I think they are extra cautious but to have no results is very disappointing.

I went to Jackie for my eyebrows.  It has now been two weeks and the scabs are gone and I love that I don't have to put pencil on them.  They look natural.  I am going to sign up to have her do eyeliner.  At first I was put off by the $47 tip she requests in her appointment letter because I didn't see that in the Groupon I purchased, but after I thought about it still felt that the Groupon of $100 and the $47 tip was still reasonable for the procedure.
