I went to see Dr Cherkuri for an initial visit. I found him to be knowledgeable and empathetic. They looked busy but not rushed. The staff was overall very friendly and seemed to want genuinely talk to you. Overall it was a good experience.

That's what happens when you are the only game in town. Some of the sales staff are truly fantastic but there are a few of the sales staff that walk around with the ere of arrogance knowing that they are the only true dealer in Az. I've had a few friends tell me the same thing and have been turned off from the whole Porsche buying experience and ended up with an M6.  I've personally had a bad experience with on of the sales staff that mockingly told me that I should go ahead and buy a similar 911 that I located out of State for $11,000 cheaper since they don't pander to customers looking "for a deal." Ok that's fine. I've had hit and miss issues with their service department but mostly they've been position.

I don't understand why people call the food bland. If you want flavor full chinese food go to PF Chang's, but expect the heavy doses of salt, butter, unsaturated fats and other stuff. For me they deliver exactly what they promise, good food, low calories and salt, with very little fat. Unlike a meal at PF Chang's you the food settles in your stomach without that heavy feeling.  I eat here often.

I had my WRX tuned by Richard and company and am very happy with their service. The car runs amazingly and their service was top notch. Richard seems like a stand up guy and his reputation around many of the tuner boards is very good. I would definitely recommend my friends who'd want their car tuned to Dyno comp.

The location is fantastic. With the back drop of Camelback mountain and McCormick ranch just around the corner, it is one of the nicest locations in terms of ambiance and people watching, and that's why they get that extra star. Staff us also friendly and helpful but for the life of me I can't get myself to spend south in a cup of coffee. Yes it's pretty good,bug the l and pop shops just around the corner are just as good without the necessary bank loan required. Just my 2 cents.

I recently had my car repaired at their dealership.  I got quotes from several other places for repair of the back and side panels on my car. After briefly talking to the owner about my issues I decided to go ahead and get the car repaired there. Their quote was a good $800 less than the other places, and they completed the work in exactly the time they had estimated. The quality of work as far as I could see was on par, and since I'm writing this review several months after the work is completed I can say that I've had no issues since. Overall, I found the owner to be professional and courteous and he seemed to go out of his way to please. I would definitely go back.

The pizza is fantastic.  You can't beat their quattro stagione pizza. Their secret is the tomato sauce which is truly authentic Italian pizza style.

What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before. It is the dream shopper's secret hang out. Where else can you find haut couture items are bargain prices. Go there once a week and try to fight off the crowds for that special piece you'd see at Neimans for 10 times the cost.

I love the service. You can pretty much find anything middle eastern here. The owner is extremely helpful and will get you anything you need even if they don't carry it.

It's always hit or miss if the person helping you is knowledgeable about the product. I for one would stick with Amazon, as you're getting the same product far cheaper. Also, I'd avoid their product protection program, cause they'll replace your item with something of much lesser value.

I was very impressed by the fact that they took their time trying to diagnose a problem I was having with my macbook. Although I waited a good 15 minutes for my appointment, they spent a good half an hour trying to fix my issue, without charging me anything. Love to just hang out at the store somethings too.

I generally don't like to give 1 star to a business but in my opinion Tri City Appliance shouldn't even get a 1 star if there was an option on Yelp. They claim to be authorized Wolf technicians but when my Wolf Range circuit board wouldn't turn on, they gave us an estimate of $2,400 because they said that they couldn't diagnose the issue and needed to replace all 3 circuit boards one by one until they got to the problem. The technician smelled like a chimney and they continued to charge the trip charges despite us paying $1200 to PARTIALLY fix the issue.  We stopped them at $1200 because they were continuing to estimate more fees. We brought in another technician who stated that the problem was a pulled electrical cord from the back when we moved the range to complete our flooring. Tri City ended up being belligerent and stick to their initial evaluation and would not give us a discount despite all parties involved knowing that the issue was a very simple fix. BTW, we ended up paying another company $95 to fix the electrical issue that Tri City initially estimated to be around $2,400. Go figure, when you call Wolf USA, they will endorse only Tri City Appliance to perform certified work but be ready to shell out big bucks!

My attempted car buying experience was not so great. They tried to throw on the Camelback buyer's package (unaffectionately know as the 'Camelback difference' by other dealerships) which depending on the mood of the general manager and how much money they think you're willing to dish out can vary from $400 to $1700.  It includes window tinting, some paint protection junk, some anti door ding junk and nitrogen in the tires which is a completely useless option. Try to negotiate all this stuff out and get the window tint thrown in for free.
