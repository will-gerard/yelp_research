Poor service. We waited 30 minutes for our food and we had not one, not two, but three different servers.  We live around the corner and were hoping for a delicious new breakfast place to come to on the weekends and left very disappointed.  Food was decent, service so poor I don't plan on ever going back.

It was okay. Not a fan of the wheat tortilla on the mojo burrito and the sweet potatoes tasted similar to carrots next to the other flavors.  Not my thing.

Unique place and lots of fun, classic games. What's even more awesome is games are completely free for the time being! We had time to beat a couple games and play many others. Amazing time, a cheap awesome night out. We will be back :)

We have done several escape rooms before and this one was ridiculously hard.  It was so difficult to the point where it was more frustrating then fun. Part of the room malfunctioned and the employees didn't assist us till we were stuck for near 10 mins! You get 3 hints and when you need them you have to wait.  It's almost as if they are distracted and are not attentive to your room when you need help. The guy who assisted us out said we did "a really great job" because the over all percentage of people that complete the room successfully was "south of 4%".  If a room has that poor of a success rate, they need to reevaluate the room! I recommend escape the room, especially if this is your first time. Much more doable and they are quick to help if you get stuck.  Bad experience.  The employee also told us the other room was more difficult and the success rate was less than 3%.  Needless to say, we won't be back for the other room.

Came in today to try a new place and didn't realize this was first day it was open. Very friendly staff and well decorated. My husband got the penne and I got the bao mi. I loved the bao mi. So good. Also got the herbal mint tea with boba, just a touch of sweet with the boba.  We will definitely be back.
