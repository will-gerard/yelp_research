Although they are always short staffed, I see that they work very hard to take care of every guest that walks through the door. The food is always fresh and yummy! Great location in North Scottsdale as well.

Disgusting sushi. Tasted like it was left out for hours, the avocado was brown and warm on all the rolls. The fish tasted sour. Never returning nor recommending.
