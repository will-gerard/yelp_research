I came here with a friend for dinner.  The waitress seemed to be intoxicated and wasn't really paying attention.   We ordered drinks and that took about 30 minutes to get.  We asked for a menu when we first arrived and that didn't come out until about 45 minutes later.   She kept pushing the lasagna on us when we didn't want it.  I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.  Not a good thing when there are other restaurants 2 steps away.

Honestly.. How can you mess up a simple order of grilled cheese with bacon and give NO BACON.  The beer was nasty and bottom of the barrel, the 'tap was out' and then you proceed to give me a cold plate of COLD LIMP BACON to make up for the mistake. This is a MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT... I'll think twice before I come back..

Yeah... I was not pleased at all with the food. I couldn't eat half of what I got (odelay scramble with hash browns).  The hash browns were very buttery and the scramble was a mess.  No real flavor other than butter and the coffee came with coffee grounds and was very bitter.

I come in every two weeks and they take excellent care of me.  Very professional, clean and kid friendly.  My hair can be difficult to cut but they do it with ease.  Check them out, you'll love it, I have for over 2 years!  :)

This place shocked me. The bad reviews that i have read seem to lack validation.  The staff has been super friendly and a tentative.  Really good happy hour to serve even better food.  Drinks are drinks anywhere you go but I'm definitely coming back for the atmosphere, especially on Thursday.  Thank you Leah and Mia for awesome service!
