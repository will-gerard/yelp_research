The Newland family, which owns Hercules Industries, has such a creepy interest in the private lives of their female employees that they sued to avoid having to comply with the new health care law, which requires contraception to covered as a preventive medication. This company also forces Catholic doctrine on it's employees, according to the injunction filed on their behalf: "Thus, for the past year and a half the Newlands have implemented within Hercules a program designed to build their corporate culture based on Catholic principles."    HVAC contractors who respect women and believe in equal rights should stay away from Hercules industries.

Pro: The housekeepers do a good job and the price is reasonable.  Con: If your experience is like mine you will need to have a VERY flexible schedule to accommodate the constant abrupt schedule changes. I've been using them for 3 months now and they have last minute rescheduled me at least five times. I have never had this problem with any other cleaning service.

Glad we decided to try this tonight. Nice unpretentious neighborhood atmosphere and good service. We had the crab dip, which is quite good, and served with a large portion of homemade potato chips. We ordered the burger with bleu cheese and the patty melt, both of which were solid. We had salads on the side rather than fries because of the big appetizer so I'm looking forward to trying the regular or sweet potato fries on future visits, as well as the different entrees. We ended by sharing a nice coffee creme brulee. Only minor complaint is that I'd like a larger draft beer selection but I can live without that.

Timos is a hidden gem in North Phx. It's beautifully decorated, with a welcoming atmosphere and a terrific staff. The food is outstanding. Every tapas dish and entree I've tried has been scrumptious and they have a good selection of wine and beer. Or you can have Amy, the best bartender in Phoenix, whip you up a cocktail. Timos gets an unqualified 5 stars from me.
