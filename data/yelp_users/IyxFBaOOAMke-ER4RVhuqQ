Oh my God... Where the heck did this hipster haven come from -- and in Phoenix of all places! Seriously, Polaroids on the wall, mason jar glasses and lots of bespectacled patrons.  I saw just how many Yelp reviews Lux had and had to lay my preconceived notions about people from Phoenix and their snobbish ways aside (I'm from Tucson, can you blame me? We're all a bunch of dirty hippies in Baja Arizona). I stopped in on a recent trip up to Phoenix and enjoyed a croissant and a latte.   I was immediately impressed with the vibe (wait, did I just use the word vibe... I think I did), even though I was a little surprised by it's location -- there's not much around it at all. Great music, great art and a laid back atmosphere that's conducive to just hanging out or perhaps writing the next great American novel.  The croissant was to die for, and the coffee was perfect -- apparently roasted on site.  I sat at the juice bar and watched an impressively mustached man create some very interesting drinks. I didn't stick around long, but I liked what I saw. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town.  The only reason I didn't go ahead and give the full five stars was the initial frustration I had when ordering -- I'm no idiot, but the process wasn't intuitive and none of the staff seemed interested in helping me out. They were too busy updating their Instagram and talking about the next greatest band you've never heard of. That sort of bummed me out, but the yummy coffee soon made up for it.

My husband and I spent the Fourth of July in Phoenix because I had to catch a plane the next morning. We were looking for someplace nice to mark the holiday and also celebrate our honeymoon. (But remember, we're from Tucson, so our definition of "nice" is a little different.)  We'd been to a few of the other Fox restaurants and wanted to try something new. Culinary Dropout was open late, and their menu looked fun.  We certainly got what we bargained for -- classic comfort foods with a twist set in an alternative atmosphere that was really enjoyable. Initially, we were worried the place was over-hyped (lots of tattooed hipsters and a dining room that could have been featured in a Rock 'n Roll issue of Dwell magazine. Luckily the decor was a compliment to the food instead of a distraction.  We got the pretzel bites with provolone fondue for an appetizer, then my husband got the meatloaf and I got the fried chicken for dinner. Ho-le-cow the food was good. I mean totally delicious and better than Mom makes (sorry, Mom).  The service was great and the food was really something to write home about. We'd definitely come here again!

Imagine every hipster, Pinterest-inspired wedding you've ever seen. Then mix all that into an overblown cliche. The Duce would be the result.  Mason jars everywhere. Park benches as tables. Barnyard and rustic "chic." And they ask for your "crazy nickname" when you order. I was waiting to find the photo booth.  Overhyped if you ask me. I can see why Guy Fieri would recommend it.  Mega overpriced menu with very limited options. The kitchen is an airstream trailer.  Also, it's half gym...? Weird.
