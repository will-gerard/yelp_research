Give this place a 1 star.....not because of the staff.  When they first came to this location it was nice....the bathroom worked.....it seems every day the women's  bathroom is out now.....one day both were out. I hope the worker's wash their hands because today I went in the men's bathroom to wash my hands before I ate and no soap. It's $7.48 for a meal.....outrageously over priced. If you get the meal of the day it's better. I usually bring my lunch but on Fridays I like the Tuna....didn't realize today is Thursday.  The one girl who has been there forever is always hustling get around busy while others just seem to stand around....age needs a raise.

The paint department at this Home Depot is totally inept any customer service whatsoever. I can't give a negative rating so I gave a 1 star rating. I waited in line for 10 minutes while they took care of a customer and then got a gentleman who talked to me about my paint. I only needed one court for the inside door I picked the red he said it would show up pink so I went to pick another color and came back. I was standing there and he wasn't waiting on anyone yet....then all of a sudden  a man showed up....and he immediately decided that he would take care if him instead if me. I waited another 10-15 minutes and this girl was done with her large order......told her what I wanted and she told me to come back on 10 minutes......I returned in 15 minutes she was waiting on someone else.....my paint still needed to be mixed. I needed one semi gloss quart if paint how damn hard could that be????? Certainly will not be coming back to Home Depot anytime soon. Ace is a smaller family hardware store but certainly has 100% better customer service!

This has to be the worst encounter I have ever had at this airport. Why have TSA Pre-Check if your going to make those members take off their shoes and stuff out of pockets like the non TSA Pre-Check people???   I don't think I ever want to fly US Airways or American again. Not only did the restaurants that are supposed to stay open till 11 closed at 930ish-10pm.....but the city council members announcement keeps going off and repeating every 1-5 seconds....it's in a stop loop so no-one can even rake a nap. Why have flights this late if the plans are just sitting outside....who's the genius who makes up the flight and crew schedules....they certainly need to be fired.

This place needs to seriously reconsider how they treat customers! TWO cashiers....I get called up to one......he is taking care of a customer on the other side and it takes 10 minutes. ....meanwhile I'm stand there and the other cashier takes care of 3 other customers.....I'm quess I was the I visible lady to everyone.....

Tried this new place after a recycle event @ Desert Ridge. Ate the basic breakfast....loved the sweet potato tots and mimosa to wash it down....gonna try their happy hour next. Best part is it's in a small shopping center on the opposite side of the busy one!

I had an expired Groupon....so I decided I'd use the credit and finally try this place. I never knew this place existed even though I think I've passed it a few times.  I really wish I brought a few beer lover friends with me to this place cause the staff is really nice and the beers are great! Had a Turkey Panini sandwich which came our just as fast as my Pale Ale. Definitely coming back and bringing friends with me to try the other beers.

Great place to get a mimosa or bacon bloody merry :-) I'm a regular at this place because of good food and great breakfast.....the staff is always friendly....but...unfortunately the customers are always rude. I've witnessed table hawks and pushiness on numerous occasion.....I've sat at the bar and had people hover over my food and try to force feed me just to get my stool.....I guess that's because this is a popular neighborhood place.

I really enjoy coming to this place when I'm traveling.....I usually get a single seat right up at the bar. My mimosas are always tasty and service is prompt. Five minutes after I ordered my food...it showed up....very fast service! One thing I love is they have the best breakfast potatoes around....delicious! Highly recommend stopping by this place.....arena I won't miss my flight ir get stressed about getting through the gate....I have TSA PreCheck. ;-)

After my ARR 5k @ South Mountain I drove home on Central.....decided to stop and try this place. Walked right in and was able to sit at the bar. I ordered OJ and the basic 2 eggs, toast, delicious thick bacon and the best home fries.....they are awesome rosemary white potatoes with onions. The only draw back is the place is small so it's a little noisy.....but very popular!

I love this neighborhood place....you can get one of their classics or customize your pizza and it's pretty much along the lines of how I've had pizza in italy for a really decent price. The rewards club is awesome.....free pies or cookies. One thing I have yet to try is their salad. Today was my birthday and I came in ordered my pizza and my beer with a cheap $2.00 refill tge paid......well after eatting and sitting here....one of the guys comes up to me....hands me a pizza and say's.....this was extra....have lunch tomorrow.....right on!

I've been here when it opened and it seems since then the crowd has died down.  Wait staff has changed a lot over the past year and recently for the good.  I still really enjoy this place and would love to see more locals out on any night....food is good...I've had the Kale salad, Chicken Panninis and other's...the local beer's are great....and It's not a loud place at all.....mostly why I like it :-)

Heading to the Phoenix Mercury game and really didn't want the same old food of the Arena so I Yelped pizza and came up with this place. It's right behind Hard Rock....very close to the Arena. Walk in and try one if their own or make your own....I ate the tomato basil with spinach and bacon.....delicious....washed down with a Stone IPA all for only $12. Much better than the Arena food.....and I didn't have to wait long at all!

Walked in and the place was buzzing with noise and crowded.....everyone wants to try the new place.....I was able to get a place at the bar next to some very friendly people who have been  waiting about an hour for their food. I was able to sit down order my beer and food immediately and I got it within 20 minutes. The salmon was delicious and very filling... Side dishes were some delicious potatoes au gratin and couscous. Shortly after I got my meal and other gentleman sat down beside me ordered a martini and some popcorn shrimp...... He said both were delicious and he will come back again. I'm not sure why the other two people did not get their order as quickly.....but it is Friday night and this place is packed. I'm thinking it might slow down after a few months...... But maybe not because all the food that I saw from different people looked great. Have to end with a shout out to Justin....nice guy and bartender :-)

Every time I come to this place I'm extremely satisfied.....service by Justin is excellent. Tonight's special was Orange Roughy topped with encrusted garlic crab meat was delicious.....paired with snow peas and potatoes au gratin....I washed it down with a Sierra Nevada pale ale. Get on their email list for coupons and specials.

Tonight I was looking for just some plain old baked chicken.....I decided to use a coupon I received from an email and go have dinner. I'm always a single so there is no wait at the bar...lol. I ordered a Longboard Lager with a glass....and looked at the menu. Nothing is just plain here on the menu.....the food has a flair and is creative. I ordered a Chicken dish but do not know the name. It basically was grilled chicken with saut√©ed spinich/artichoke/ goat cheese on top. My side was potatoes au gratin which are always delicious here. Veggies where basic squash with spices and cheese. I'd have to say everything was great ....definitely not boring to the taste buds. Service was great but one waiter kept brining me everyone's food....lol....not sure why he thought a small skinny girl could eat that much.

Although it's a Sunday and busy I'm very disappointed this location doesn't have the NFL package....they only get the local games you can get on your own T....which go a sports bar is surprising.  I'm here only because I didn't want to cook breakfast.....which they now have a $10 or $15 option....which both are a pretty good deal. The problem with the breakfast is the scrambled eggs.....so I'm thinking it's basic quality and not actually eggs....another problem is the toast comes out untoasted on one side and not buttered at all....good luck trying to get butter. The bacon and mimosas are good. The problem with service is that when I arrived there was one gal working the whole bar....not sure if others were on a break or what.....then 20 minutes later a guy shows up walking around cleaning dishes....and he actually took a few drink orders....now there are two gal's doing the bar.....I'm confused as to who gets my tip now....so it's obvious n I think gonna be 20%. I would say if your looking to try beers and hang out with only appetizers and light eating afair then this would be perfect.

I've been wanting to try this place....so I decided to try it right before the Phoenix Mercury opener. Well...if you sit up at the bar service is fast.....so tgey gwt a 1/2 star....the restroom is clean so they get 1/2 star. Food was served quickly.....1/2 star. You get to make your own burger....how you want it...so 1/2 star. Total 2 stars. Food is over priced....and it's cold when you get it......and I had to ask for extra lettuce-sprouts because there were hardly any on the turkey burger I ordered. I was lucky enough to get the happy hour $4.00 pints of Grand Canyon beer......so I would give another star for that. I should have gone someplace else but you never know till you try....
