Late night.  Okay atmosphere.  Nice servers.   Food wasn't fantastic this time, but that doesn't mean I won't be back.  Sometimes we wait a while for service and our food, but we normally come late @ night or during busy hours so I don't hold it against them.   Appetizer sampler is always good.  My husband and I come often.   Carpets could use a cleaning, but all and all, good experiences are had here.

I went in b/c I didn't feel well, like all people do. The service from the staff was really great. The front staff were so kind to my husband and I. The back office staff were kind as well.   The only reason Im not giving WVUC 5 stars, is because of the physician I was seen by. She was extremely nice, but she seemed un-knowlegable. I left more confused then I was when I walked in and I was still sick. I ended up going to a different Urgent Care and got better.

I LOVE this McDonalds! Awesome service, friendly smiles & great tasting food. I alter every order I make here (b/c I'm picky) and it's ALWAYS correct, I never have to send it back or go in from the drive thru b/c it's wrong.   I have been coming to this location for probably 2 years and I've seen staff promoted and it's so awesome. I can't say enough good things about this mcdonalds. Keep up the great work you guys!!! :)

Coming to this chipotle feels like home. I know I can always come and get top notch customer service and excellent food. The line is usually long, but it's more than worth it.

I ALWAYS go to Alliance Urgent Care for myself as well as my husband and children. We go here more than our PCPs.   The receptionists do their jobs and are never rude to me or my family.   The physicians are ALWAYS extremely knowledgable and efficient. I always leave w/ answers. I can't complain.

I love Chili's and so do my little ones. Upon their resounding request, we came.   Today the service is a little slow, but normally service is on point.  I give a pass, b/c when we walked in every table was sat and it seemed pretty tense. My server was nice and friendly nonetheless and our food was great.   Ordering dessert from the Ziosk was pretty nice as well.   Keep up the good work Chili's!

4/27/13 Worst Starwood hotel ever.   Went to celebrate our anniversary and relax, but that's not what we got.  The hotel was loud and the staff we not very accommodating.  We will never return.

Fast service. I've never been disappointed dropping in to grab a couple of pizzas. I'm pleased that they opened this location so close to my house. We conveniently grab pizza @ least once a week and we are never disappointed.

I love this place. They always have what I need and they're so friendly and polite. They are only one of the places I go to for nail supplies, but I definitely enjoy coming here. Management is always knowledgable and if they DONT know something, they make sure they get you the answer ASAP
