Personally if I am shopping somewhere as high end as Saks Fifth Avenue where they cater to a higher end clientele I think I deserve good customer service. I came by here today to return a shirt that I had bought recently and received major attitude by the gentleman who helped me. He treated me as though I was an inconvenience to him. I then proceeded to go upstairs to purchase some jeans and the sales guy was rude and made me feel the same way! Horrible and seriously unacceptable and I don't plan on shopping here in the future and you shouldn't either.

I LOVE LGO! The place has been around for years now and it is always consistently good! The shop it's self is beyond adorable and has some great stuff that would be great gifts or a nice little something for yourself!  I have tried a little bit of everything from their menu. My favorites are the  *Smoked Salmon Salad that comes with baby spinach, arugula, basil, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, cous cous, house vinaigrette, its addictive and different and only $8.50.  *Guacamole BLT - Which has amazing thick cut bacon, fresh tomatoes, lettuce and guacamole. It's perfect and super filling. $7.25  but my serious all time favorite is their Croque Madame - broiled open-faced w/ ham, tomato, sunny-side egg, spicy mustard sauce and gruyere and a steal for $7.50!  They have insane freshly baked good - Try their homemade english muffins! You will never want to go back and and buy Thomas' English Muffins again, you will be permanently ruined! It's a great place to check out for Breakfast or lunch. It can be kinda busy at times and parking is a pain but trust me it's worth it!

I will make this short simple and to the point since there are 400 other reviews! Mondays and Tuesdays after 8:00pm this place is the best deal in town - $20.00 for a bottle of wine and some of the best (and generous portions I might add) bruschetta I've had! Heck even if it's not monday or tuesday this place is amazing! Great location, Great service,Great wine, and Great food = A fabulous time!

Jt's Bar & Grill is exactly what I have been looking for in the Valley! Neighborhood dive bar where everyone seemed to know each other, insanely friendly service (shout out to Kerri!) and killer bar food and chicken wings of epic proportions!  I am a chicken wing connoisseur, and frankly Jt's may have the best chicken wings I have EVER had! They deep fry those baby's, sauce em and throw them on the grill. They have several choices of sauces the best was the works which featured all of their sauces mixed together minus their suicide sauce which produced a delicious and not too spicy wing! I like my wings ultra spicy so I ordered a side of the Suicide sauce, which I personally loved - definitely spicy but not so that your mouth is on fire. Their wings will set you back $7.50 for a dozen ( Which makes me love this place more!).  They have a pretty large beer selection on tap and every liquor you would want! This place is def going to be apart of my repertoire and it should be for you too!

Decided to check out this joint for my annual Christmas Eve Thai fest and soo happy that I did! Their curries were spicy and full of flavor and their spring rolls were delicious! I can't wait to come back and try more of their dishes. One of the more authentic Thai places I have found in Arizona!

Having lived in Southern California for nearly 10 years, I used to frequent 99 Ranch Market pretty regularly. After I moved back to Phoenix, I started to go through Asian Grocery Store withdrawals. So when someone told me about Lee Lee International Supermarket I squealed in excitement! It's pretty far from where I live but I try to make it there a few times a month and stock up!

If there was a support group for individuals addicted to both coffee and bagels, you would find me there. Chompie's is my go to place for a delicious/fresh and cheap bagel and coffee on my way into the office.  They have a pretty large selection of bagel flavors as well as cream cheese flavors and service is always friendly and efficient.  I have dined in their actual restaurant several times and never had a bad meal or experience. If you looking for some fantastic jewish deli fare, Chompie's is your best bet!

I recently dined at Benihana for my birthday celebration. I always loved going to Benihana because it is typically an entertaining meal. So in my mind instead of going to a quiet dinner for my birthday this year that I would change things up and hit up this joint.   Welllllll let's just say nothing went right that evening... Our cook hardly muttered a hi to anyone at the table, basically cooked the meal and that was it. I got the Ocean Treasure that evening and lets just say I was sick all evening last night.   Not exactly the way I wanted to spend my birthday :(

I stopped here the other afternoon for a quick drink - It was a beautiful sunny afternoon in Scottsdale and I was out shopping and maybe quite possibly afternoon restaurant/bar hopping! I was slightly enjoying the fact that everyone else in the country was in a deep freeze and here I am in beautiful sunny 75 degree in January Scottsdale Az. We sat down and ordered a couple bloody mary's and then my eyes rested upon the fresh oyster display they had next to the bar - I LOVE oysters and frankly I had to try some! I ordered half a dozen oysters - I can't remember exactly where the oysters were from, but I ordered two of each of the available oysters. All 3 varieties were fresh and delicious! Service was great and our bloody mary's complimented the oysters perfectly! I can't wait to come back here for a leisurely lunch.

Ok, I mean seriously who doesn't love Dollar Tree?! Since I obviously spend a small fortune on dining out, I am always looking for bargains somewhere. Dollar Tree is my go to stop for random funny gifts, stocking stuffers, cleaning supplies, candy for my work candy jar.

Like all great sushi restaurants they are typically found in a unsuspecting strip malls and Hiro sushi is no exception to this rule. To tell you I love Hiro Sushi would be an understatement... The fish here is beyond fresh, I wasn't a fan of Salmon sashimi until I ate theirs. I swear on my cocker spaniels life that I could sit there and eat my weight in their in salmon sashimi. Sushi chefs were always totally friendly and helpful, and service was always spot on.   I am not a huge roll gal, but their rolls are pretty amazing as well... I highly recommend their Arizona roll.  So if your looking for some great sushi this is your spot!

Zipps Sports Grill is a solid spot to head to for Happy Hour or to check out a game on the weekend. It's super casual, and the prices can't be beat. They have a killer happy hour special, $6.00 for 10 of their famous wings, or you can get an order of their skewers $3.00 well cocktails, or zipperitas, and $4.00 32oz domestic beers or premium pints!  It's no secret that I am a total wing junkie. I think I may be in need of a support group. If wings are on the menu then wings will be what I order. One would assume that something as simple as Chicken Wings would be hard to screw up. That is not true my friends... Who wants over cooked, over sauced, soggy chicken wings? Not me! The wings were perfectly crispy, deep fried to perfection and the sauce to wing ratio was spot on. And for $6.00 who can complain. The only thing that slightly bothered me was they charged me $0.50 for a side of ranch, I hate when places do that. Other than that, service was adequate, food was good, and for the price you can't beat it. Perfect laid-back  HH evening

I am a huge fan of Arriba Mexican Grill! If you like spicy this is the place for you! When your seated they give you some of the best made fresh daily chips with 3 different types of dip (a spicy bean, a mild and a hot salsa). They have a great margarita selection ( the prickly pear is great as is the mango!)   Now down to the food! They have a great selection of lunch specials that are pretty cheap (from 6.99  - 10.99) and have decent sized protons. They are served Monday through Friday from 11am - 4pm!   The dinner protons are huge! And they have a huge menu! My favorite things there are the queso fundido (a great cheese dip, spicy but good!) the Poco Pollo Con Queso is to die for, as are the white sands chimichangas. I find the white sands to be a little spicy for me sometimes, so I usually switch out the spicy pork for the machaca or chicken.   It's not only a great place for a family to dine, but it's also a great place to go and hang with friends.

Bagels and coffee, it's my thing! But good service is super important to me and when I get exceptional service I frankly want to tell everyone I know! Einstein's of course has decent bagels, breakfast sandwiches etc... This particular location is even adjacent to a Starbucks (like I said, coffee and bagels.... it's my thing)! But what really has me stoked is the service here, Manager Tom really made my day with his dashing personality! It's always nice when employees actually seem like they don't mind working or gasp! even possibly enjoy their job!  So thanks Tom for making my Einstein Bros Bagel trip a memorable experience!

Yesterday my Toms shoes totally destroyed my left heel leaving me with a nasty infection that caused my ankle to become a cankle and it was seriously painful to boot. But who wants to deal with emergency rooms or urgent care? After family intervention and the real possibility of my foot falling off I decided to let my pride go and visit my local hospital!  Upon first entering the waiting room it looked like there was going to be quite a wait, great... I had work the next morning and wanted to go home and watch some food network before I passed out. That was looking like a grim prospect... But alas they had me triaged, had me in the back, seen by an amazing Physicians Assistant who was fast and friendly, my foot was cleaned and wrapped and antibiotics, tetanus shot and discharge paperwork in about an hour! Hopefully I won't have to use them again but if I do at least I know I am in good hands!

My first experience at Keg Steakhouse and Bar was super disappointing.... I came with some of my family, we had a rough week with a family member in the hospital and I had missed my brothers birthday so we were looking for some good comforting food to put us in a happily needed food coma! And they had prime rib, which my mom had been craving - She never goes out and splurges on a nice meal, and I love taking care of her when I am in town.   First off our server was friendly and efficient... but that's really where the good ends and the bad starts.  But on to the disappointing part, I don't know what was happening in their establishment on this particular night, but It seemed as though every item I ordered they were out of... And It was early, our reservation was for 7:15pm. First the cocktail I wanted they couldn't make - It had kiwi and they were out of kiwi (but of course after I was informed they were out of it, I saw someone drinking the kiwi martini, who had come in after I did... It would have been nice if the server informed me that they had kiwi back in stock and that would have been an easy $8.00 added on to my bill)  Now on to the appetizer order, I ordered the Mushrooms Neptune, the Calamari and the cheese toast - Of course they were out of the Mushrooms Neptune. Not looking so good here, We should have left. The apps that they did have came and were good - Calamari was crispy and had good dipping sauces.  Then we order entrees - My mom and I both ordered the Prime Rib, waitress takes order, out come our salads and soups then out comes the waitress with menus informing us that they were OUT OF PRIME RIB! The whole reason we came here to dine was for the prime rib and they run out at 7:45 on a Saturday Night.... So bummed, more so since I know how much my mom was looking forward to the prime rib and she had a rough week, and it was strange that it took our waitress a good 20 minutes to inform us that they had run out, super unprofessional. So we ordered bone in rib eyes instead which were yummy but not prime rib :/  On the flip side management sent over a few deserts on the house, but to be honest I don't know if that is enough redemption for me to want to quite frankly take a chance and come back and dine here or recommend it to anyone else. I understand one slip up, but every time I turned around something else was hitting the fan. The meal was pretty pricey ($280.00), and we left disappointed!

I feel horrible that I haven't updated my review for the keg! After my last dining experience I thought for sure there was no way I would ever go back the keg! But I received an e-mail via yelp from the owner of the establishment apologizing for the service that we had received and said to let her know next time we went back in.  So we went back a few weeks ago and our second time was leaps and bounds better than our first. They had the prime rib (which was seriously fabulous and cooked to perfection!), our server was amazing and on top of things and I had my kiwi cocktail! The stars aligned that night and we had a perfect evening! I can not wait to go back to The Keg to eat their delicious food, experience their fabulous service and the beautiful ambiance.   Kudos also to the general manager who was genuinely concerned with my experience the first time at the Keg - He was really interested in hearing my concerns and wanted to know what they could do better in the future to making dining there a much more positive experience. For that reason alone it shows the pride they take in the restaurant and are concerned about YOUR experience and I will be back.... and bragging to everyone about this place.

I left the village tavern last night feeling like I had been cheated out of a decent dinner. I have dined there in the past several times and always had a positive experience. Sadly last night was not at all how I had remembered it.  Service was great, as we waited we were offered a beverage and our waitress was good and a kind gentleman who was leaving the bar area was kind enough to give us his table. But that unfortunately can't make up for the terribly over cooked food we received which frankly should have never been allowed to leave the kitchen like that.   I ordered their salmon entree which was served with coscous which was mushed together so much it resembled the pan it had been it and it was cold when served. The salmon was so over cooked that it was beyond dry and was almost more like eating chicken than a delicious filet of salmon. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Marsala and his was like sandpaper. He did enjoy the spinach salad and the other plus was wine was half off on Wednesdays!  I was just really disappointed in the quality of the food I received.

Going to George and Sons is like going home and having my mom cook me a homemade meal - having grown up in the area George and Sons was a frequent take out spot as a teenager! The food was good then and it's just as good if not better now! They have killer egg rolls, they don't skimp on portions (imagine a shrimp dish with more than half a dozen shrimp!) and service was awesome and imagine my surprise when good ol' George was there not only greeting patrons but bussing tables and ensuring things ran smoothly! They have live music on Saturday nights, and awesome lunch buffet during the week and a full bar!

Buffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse... I adore you  Why, most of you ask? I am a true wisconsinite! And buffalo chip is where we belong! Cheese curds, Broasted chicken, beer chasers with our bloody mary's... heck to the yes!   Us cheese heads have to stick together and I am glad I found my spot!   Baffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse... As a wisconsinite and cheese curd and broasted chicken loving girl... my heart and soul is yours as long as you support the packers!   plus the food and service is amazing, even if you aren't all about all things Wisconsin (which, I frankly will never understand!)

I am a coffee bean girl - anyone who knows me knows I have a serious addiction... But at the urging of a good girlfriends husband who is a fan of this coffee shop insisted I check it out!  Service was great and their lattes were as good if not better than some of their name brand competitors. They also have a good selection of baked good and sandwiches. It is def on my rotation for coffee stops! It's also super cool that they roast their own coffee beans daily!

Since moving back to the Valley of the Sun, I have had a hard time finding both good and fresh seafood. It's one of the few things my little heart is broken over since leaving LA. Traffic on the 405 nope, don't miss that a bit... The better than thou attitudes and the plastic LA scene, nope, can't say I miss that either... But having access to super fresh seafood is something this girl misses... ALOT!  So last night when this chick was craving some fresh oysters and fantastic seafood... I was at a loss as to where to go, that was until Wildfish Seafood Grille was suggested. I thought sure, why not, haven't been there but frankly wasn't expecting to be wowed. Made a quick reservation through open table on my trusty Yelp app on my iphone and off we were to Wildfish!   Once we arrived we were greeted by 3 super friendly hostesses and were promptly sat in a comfortable booth, Our server Charles was quick to the table to take our drink order and was both knowledgable of the menu but also friendly, funny and engaging and was never too intrusive during our meal. It's rare that you find both good food and service so out of this world that it makes you want to go back and dine there every night of the week, but Wildfish delivered the good food and Charles delivered the stellar service!   We started off with a dozen oysters, which were fresh and delicious. Only complaint was that there were a few chunks of shells in several of my oysters but it happens. I can't wait to come back for more delicious and fresh oysters ASAP!   Being torn between 3 different entrees, I looked to Charles for his suggestion. He suggested (The Sea bass) and boy he was seriously just spot on. The Chilean Sea Bass is steamed Hong Kong Style served in a light soy broth. The fish was not only super fresh, but it was cooked to perfection and the soy broth perfectly balanced the dish. It would be hard to ever go there and order a different entree after eating that! They had a scallop dish that was a special that particular evening and they were smaller scallops served with roasted grapes, that dish was also quite delicious and I thought the grapes were an interesting addition. We ordered two small sides, The Brussels sprouts and the sautéed spinach, both good but the Brussels Sprouts were the real standout. We finished off our meal with their delicious bananas foster butter cake with butter pecan ice cream ( I think I died and went to sugar coma heaven) .  So moral of this story is this.... Go to Wildfish Seafood and Grille, make sure Charles is your server, order the oysters (if your into that kind of thing!) and get the Chilean Sea Bass and don't skip desert!

Dearest Binkley's,  I didn't think it was possible to fall head over heals in love with another restaurant as I have with you. My heart races and my stomach is full of butterflies every time I think of you. I have not experienced these kinds of feelings since my trip to the South of France and my subsequent meal at Tatou where I ate quite possibly the worlds best bouillabaisse. I didn't think love like that was possible again, but alas you proved that to be wrong.    I don't think there are enough words to describe my delightful evening with you - It was astonishing, mind blowing, inexplicable, stupendous, exquisite, clever. From the out of this world service to my bacon smoked manhattan, which is quite possibly the best drink I have ever had - and really how do you do that? It's one of the many amazing tricks you have up your sleeve to keep us coming back wanting... wait, no craving more! I can hear the crowds outside the restaurant cheering BINKLEY'S, BINKLEY'S, BINKLEY'S!  From the well thought out and endless courses of the amuse bouche - you definitely did more than give me a little bit of food to amuse my mouth and invigorate my palate! Starting with the worlds smallest (and tastiest!) sloppy joe on the worlds smallest brioche bun - which subsequently made me giggle in delight, to the pineapple with pancetta which was delightful and delicious, and I can't forget about the mini fried chicken and waffle which was simply heavenly.  My taste buds were lucky enough to indulge in the 6 course tasting menu, each course better than the next! From the ever so beautifully presented Steak Tartare, the perfectly seared crispy Foie Gras, to the out of this world white truffle pumpkin risotto, with the freshly shaved and ever so fragrant Alba white truffle. The black cod was moist and the bacon wrapped Guinea Hen was exquisite. The grand finale aka the black truffle fondue was stellar and the deserts were phenomenal. There was not a point through out my entire meal that I did not enjoy.   So thank you for giving my palate a mind blowing evening, and I can't wait until next time... I am counting down the hours until I can come back and be in your presence - until then, I am left with the fond memories of the evening we shared together!   Love,    Roxy

My parent's live out this way and when I come and visit I am always looking for somewhere nice to grab a glass of wine and this is just the place I have been looking for!  The restaurant is located right up in Verrado (which is a beautiful neighborhood) in the little town square. Service was fantastic, Wine was fantastic and the pizza was fantastic as was the desert that I got talked into! I had the Dame Edna which has Mozzarella, Arugula, Parma Prosciutto, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano. I have tried to replicate this at home and with no avail is it as good as it is here!  If your in the area and looking for a great place to try, go here!  Just make sure you leave some room for the Dolce Della Casa which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream.

Nee House is the bee's knees! No seriously though, after living in Los Angeles for the last 8 years and my frequent trips to the Bay area have exposed me to some absoutley delicious  mind blowingly good chinese food... Said mind blowingly good chinese food is hard to find here in the Valley, that was until my darling boyfriend let me in on what I consider one of his best kept secrets. I mean seriously though, you may chuckle a bit at that statement but know this... I love my food, he loves his food so when two foodies end up together you know your serious when they decide to let you in on one of the fav secret foodie spots.   So here is the 411 on the good, the bad and well maybe not the ugly.   The Good Stuff: I knew it was love at first sight when I walked in and saw tanks with live fish, crabs and lobsters! Tell me the last time you entered a resturant in Arizona, mind you a hole in the wall chinese joint that has flippin fresh live fish that aren't for decoration but rather to be consumed and doused in the delicious flavors that is Nee House. A word to the wise, get the peking duck... a whole huge duck, perfectly prepared, moist with ever so crispy skin and freshly steamed bao buns for $33.00, it's not for the faint of heart or really the appetite challenged! The shrimp with snow peas is delicious, as is the fried rice and well pretty much everything I have ever ordered from this joint (not a huge fan of their kung pao but thats my opinion)  The bad: While service wasn't bad per say, It wasn't great. The staff there was super friendly once we sat down and  they happily assisted us when we needed them, but they aren't super attentive nor did they go out of their way, and they can be a tad bit slow at times but really - when you have chinese food this good, I don't care about the service - just make sure you keep making that delicious food of yours!  So I know the boyfriend will be upset with me for ratting out this secret gem, but he knew he started dating a Yelper so really he knew food secrets don't stay that way for long!

I was driving around the other day and noticed Pure Sushi and remember thinking I am going to have to try that place out! Thankfully, I didn't have to wait long at all! A friend and I were looking for a place to check out for dinner and we both wanted sushi so I suggested we check out Pure Sushi over our usual joints. The decor inside is appealing, and very minimal, lots of white!  Service was fantastic throughout our entire meal, our waitress was really on top of things was helpful and friendly.   The two stand out items of the entire meal was the Fire Dragon Roll which has shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and cucumber inside, fresh tuna with cilantro and jalapeno on top, served with spicy poke sauce. It's fresh and flavorful and the spicy poke sauce with the cilantro and jalapeño really brings it over the top!  They have amazing happy hour specials from 3-6pm Monday through Friday and 11-6pm on Saturday and Sundays. I have heard amazing things about their poke and sea bass so those are my next must try items!   I def can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!

My love for Andreoli Italian Grocer knows no limits! I have been coming here long before their infamous debut on diners drive in's and dives, I also reluctantly admit that I was apprehensive to yelp about this place because I was scared that once the secret got out so would my dear beloved Andreoli's.   Thankfully, even with the major notoriety this place has received over the last year or so, not a thing has changed about this place other than the size of the restaurant and the Guy Fieri poster plastered on the door as you walk in.   The Patriarch aka Chef Giovanni still consistently serves up some of the best Italian food in town. A must if your on this side of town!

I have dined at Roka Akor several times, both for Happy Hour and Dinner.  Everytime service has been great and food has been mostly exceptional. The only item I have tried there that I wasn't a fan of was their Ginger Teriyaki Chicken Breast, the meat was super dry! My go to item has always been the Yuzu Miso Marinated black cod and I have fallen in love with their grilled rice! But everything from their sushi, which is always melt in your mouth fresh and delicious. I am a huge fan of their Salmon Nigiri, Toro Nigiri, O Toro Nigiri, and Chu Toro Nigiri. Their butter fish tataki with yuzu and white asparagus is out of this world. If your there for happy hour which is Sun-Fri from 4:30-7:00pm, a must have is their Japanese style fried chicken that is accompanied by a smoke chili aioli, I could eat that every single day for the rest of my life and be a happy camper! Their Hamachi Serrano chili roll is also another must have! If there is one thing I would pass on, it would be their tacos... Is the fish fresh, undoubtedly yes, but I personally find them rather bland! Its a must try if your looking for a hip social scene with great food, but be prepared to drop some dough, if your on a budget but still want to experience their amazing food Happy Hour is for you!

I don't normally understand the hype around burgers - you've had one you've had them all - that is until I had their speciality Cabernet Burger. It's a 1/2 pound beef patty flavored with cabernet wine, topped with swiss cheese, bacon jam, caramelized onions and onion aioli served with some of the most phenomenal french fries I have had in some time! The paninis were insane as well, crispy and really flavorful!  Service was great - drinks were never empty and waiters were friendly.  The decor is cute and french themed. Worth checking out if you are in the area!

This past year I decided that I was crazy and wanted to start doing triathlons, so I was in need of a gym that had all the amenities that would help make that goal a little easier. With my crazy work schedule, I loved that they are open 24 hours a day! I will admit, I have totally been a crazy lady there at 1:00am in the lap pool.  Since this is a premiere facility or as they like to refer to it as an Onyx facility, the amenities are pretty awesome as well... Great locker rooms, which are always been attended to and are spotless. Customer service is killer, Tony my on boarding guy is awesome - always willing to answer any questions I have. You have to go see him when you go to check the place out.   Their classes are awesome... if you have kids, their kids club looks pretty awesome, I mean there is really something for everyone here! If your looking for a gym this is your gym. I should note that I used to be a member of the Village and while it was great, I am sooo happy I switched to Life Time.  So go check it out, go see Tony and be ready to be a blown away!

Café Monarch is unlike any other dining establishment in the valley, other reviews have compared it to a secret garden and frankly that couldn't be a more appropriate comparison.  The atmosphere here is simply breathtaking.  It's the perfect location for anyone looking for a special intimate evening.  The sound of the water fountain, the flickering of the candle light, the beautiful and lush landscape is something out of a fairytale.   From my experience with most restaurants is that they either have a beautiful atmosphere or good food, rarely do you find both.  This is not the case here; this family owned and operated restaurant prides itself on offering diners the best dining experience possible. With a menu that changes weekly, they are able to offer diners a delicious meal that consists of fresh, organic, all natural seasonal ingredients. Owner Christian Lewkowicz is so passionate about offering diners such a well rounded experience, that He and all of his servers are currently training to become sommelier's, which as far as I know Café Monarch will be the only restaurant in the Valley with such training. Because the menu is always evolving, and the attention to detail; it's the perfect spot for anyone who considers themselves a foodie!   The particular evening that I dined there, We arrived a few minutes early.. So we sat outside and had a cocktail while we waited for our table to be ready.  I ordered the El Diablo which has Olmeca Altos Silver Tequila, Gran Marnier, Watermelon Fresca, Muddled Jalapeno, fresh lime, fresh lemon with a sugar-chili rim. It was delicious and I love that all of the ingredients were fresh, I highly recommend ordering it.   Once seated inside the restaurant - our server came by the table and explained what that evening's menu options were.  Never once throughout the entire meal did I feel rushed. Our server was friendly, engaging, well educated on the menu and wines offered and very discreet.    We were started off with a delicious amuse bouche of Steelhead pate with crispy wontons, It was delicious and a perfect way to start the meal.   The second course was an arugula salad with feta and red quinoa -  the portion was huge and the salad was perfectly balanced. I ordered the wine pairing with the meal, which I highly recommend. All of the wines offered on the pairing menu are not available on their regular wine list. The salad was paired with a beautiful French white Lorie wine by Domanie Du Lobard. It was the perfect pairing to the salad course, light and crisp with a little fruitiness.   For my entree I got the Sautéed Chilean Sea Bass, Crab-Edamame-Saffron Risotto, Petite Shaved Fennel-Onion Salad, Vanilla Bean-Lemon Beurre Blanc. I LOVE Chilean Sea Bass and it may have been the best sea bass I have had. The real stand out of the entire meal and a must have were the Seared "Diver" Scallops with Baby Spinach and Bourbon-Shallot Sauce which is well worth the $20.00 additional charge.  The entrée was paired with a Greek wine Skouras Saint George Nemea.  I wasn't expecting a red wine to be a good pairing to the Sea Bass, but it complimented the flavors perfectly.   The desert was a shortbread with fresh berries which was paired with a delicious  Prosecco.   I thoroughly enjoyed my entire evening at Café Monarch and can't wait to dine here again in the future. For the quality of food and the price point ($65.00/pp and $30.00 for wine pairing) it will be apart of my regular rotation!

I live in the area and I frequent this joint on a pretty regular basis for happy hour. I love their happy hour, the prices are pretty much unmatched. I will admit, I am not a huge fan of their regular menu. I personally think their prices are pretty high for what they serve.   Def a must visit if your looking for some great happy hour deals (which they do all day on Sundays!).   Service is always fast and friendly!

I don't get the hype or the solid four star rating on yelp. I came here expecting this amazing and unique dining experience and instead I got mediocre food and service and left hungry/frustrated/annoyed and $500.00 poorer. I kid you not, we had to stop by jack in the box on the way home (after paying $500.00 for dinner)  The concept of posh is really innovative, just severely poorly executed. You go in and they give you a form that you fill out, crossing off things you don't like, meats, veggies, dietary restrictions the whole 9 yards, and they create a menu just for you. You start off with a soup or salad and go from there. One of my dining companions for the evening got 2 very similar flan type dishes in a row, pretty much unacceptable in my book. Your paying 75.00 a person and they couldn't possibly think that giving someone two very similar dishes might not be appropriate. Most dishes were pretty poorly executed, I had a mushroom soup that was super salty, they ruined the uni by somehow over saucing it with a soy base making it beyond salty and nearly inedible. Although I will say that they had a shrimp dish and the wild boar bacon were both pretty stellar and their cocktail menu was extensive and all of our drinks were amazing.  Like another reviewer said and in my opinion is beyond correct, coming here is like playing Russian roulette, and if it yielded great results it wouldn't be a problem, but I think they have over extended themselves and in this case I got the bullet.   There are far better establishments to try in the valley that do the tasting menus right, try Crudo instead. It's easier on the wallet and the food is insane, I would skip Posh.

Hi my name is Roxy and I am a hot wing addict. I get it, I am a petite, blonde haired female. Typically that and hot wings don't go together. My mother would disown me if she knew that her only daughter ate with her hands, goes through more napkins and ranch dressing than any female ever should and joined what is supposed to be a boys only club. But don't fret mother, I still can't drink a beer, all hope isn't lost!  So being the wing addict that I am, I have searched high and low for wings - and I frankly really hate to admit this, but Buffalo Wild Wings has some legit good chicken wings.... besides they have more flavors than a Baskin Robbins.  Besides, they have every game on known to man and a huge selection of beer (which is ahem every mans dream), the place is super kid friendly and they have great cocktails to drown away any pain and torture your wife, girlfriend, secret girlfriend, want her to be your girlfriend is enduring by being forced to watch professional sports.  But for me... Really it's simple - I come for the wings!

I honestly love Blue Martini - they have some insane Martinis (fly me to the moon anyone?!), their appetizers are insane and if your a chick and a member of their ladies only club you get a coupon for a free martini! Service has always been top notch and they have live music which is a plus!

Elvis is rolling under his grave over this abomination. As a preface; I love Elvis and love Cirque du Soleil shows. In fact, I have seen the Beatles LOVE show four times and think it one of the best live shows ever. As for VIVA Elvis, God only knows what they were thinking. It is actually painful to watch, and it was noticable that many in our audience left before the end of the show. One would need to be 75 years old and a peer of Elvis for any chance of this being entertaining (even in a nostalig way). So sad, but this is the biggerst loser I can remember. Save your time on this one and buy one of his albums if you want any fond memories.

This show really surprised me. I went with low expectations, and came away thrilled. It is well conceived, fast paced and very entertaining. The singers are marvelous and an overall good time. It is a little skewed to youth, so I expect that younger folks (especially Girls Next Door generation) will appreciate it more than older folks, but was definetly a good time for all.

On my long drive into work half asleep wishing I was still at home in bed cuddling with adorable cocker spaniel Sadie, there is one thing that I can always count on to perk me right up; Dutch Brother Coffee. Now you see, I feel a little wrong confessing my love affair with Dutch Brothers. I have lived in sunny SoCal for the last 8 years and was and in my respects still am a Coffee Bean girl! I love their customer service, I have yet to encounter an employee who is anything but delightful and full of enthusiasm. So if you haven't already joined the Dutch Brothers Coffee bandwagon, I suggest you get on now!

First off I am in love with the decor of Modern steak. It is hip and feels like something you would find at a swanky Las Vegas hotel. I went there for lunch and I had the Jumbo Shrimp Louie with hearts of palm, tomato and avocado ($16.00). It was great, the shrimp were really huge and everything in the salad was fresh and was just phenomenal. My friend had the twin sliders and said they were great as well.   I have been always impressed with the restaurants and quality of food that FOX Restaurant Concepts put's out. I have NEVER had an issue with service, and the quality of food they put out!

Hi my name is Roxy and I am an Asian market addict.  No, it is a seriously true statement. There isn't anything that I love more in this world (well food wise that is) than walking into an asian supermarket, funky smell and all and perusing every isle full of items that I am culturally not familiar with.   I have been to all the Asian markets in Phoenix, Ranch Market, Lee Lee' in Mesa and Glendale... even the small mom and pop shops. But after visiting Mekong Supermarket today it's quite clear to who the stand out winner is, and that would be Mekong a mile above anyone else.   First, it's more of a small mall than a supermarket. Craving dim sum, there is a place for you there... Pho - Done... Fast take out chinese food, yep they got that too. Asian bakery with take out pork buns done... heck there is really something here for everyone. I could have easily made Mekong a day long excursion ( One day soon it will be!).  I have a passion for Asian cuisine. I think the flavor profiles are so complex, spicy, sweet, salty total umami. I cook at home and I love to experiment with ingredients that are out of my comfort zone and I find that Asian markets provide that sense of adventure.   First upon walking in I realized how large their fresh meat and sea food areas are.... They offer everything you could ever want.. Looking for duck heads and feet? They have that here... Pork belly, pork hocks, beef short ribs, flank short ribs, chicken feet, pork blood you get the idea... Now don't even get me started on the fresh fish selection. There is every kind of crustacean you would want - head on and headless, the fresh fish selection is as diverse as the crowd that you will see shopping at Mekong. I mean they had live spot prawns - I lived in cali for nearly 10 years and never saw those anywhere I shopped.  The rest of the store was large and diverse, and was sensory overload for me in a good way. I couldn't help but to do a bit of a happy dance throughout the store.  I came home with an abundance of goodies, and made a fabulous meal celebrating my 400th yelp review.... So thank you mekong for officially becoming my favorite and most beloved asian market in the valley, and thank you Larry and Fred the live dungeness crabs who I bought today at Mekong and made into a delicious meal tonight!   Its a must visit in the valley!

I don't get the hype over 5th and Wine... I've come here a few times with friends for a glass of wine and an app. Service hasn't ever been great, food is bland and their wine list is mediocre at best. The inside of the bar doesn't remind me at all of a wine bar. They really need to re-do their menus and décor a bit and add some wow factor. I don't think I will be returning any time soon

After purchasing some new art work for my place I was in need of a few picture frames... A girlfriend told me to check out hobby lobby and let's just say upon entering the store it was clear that I could not only get lost in here for days but it could also put me in the poor house as well! There is def something there for everyone... And every project Pinterest throws your way.  The frames were cheap to begin with but they were 50% off as well!

I will admit, I am not a girly girl. I am low maintenance and haven't ever been that girl who got their nail's done on a regular basis. I hated, I mean HATED going to other nail salons where I couldn't frankly have a conversation with my technician and worse than that I hated all of the side conversations they had, and the constant up sell's.  I dreamt of a place that wasn't pricey, did awesome nail art when I wanted, offered some good conversation if I wanted. I wanted kinda the dry bar of nail salons, and frankly that's what 20 nail lounge is!  Ashley always kills it doing my nails, I always leave with something fun and cute, plus she is just the sweetest girl around. $20.00 for a basic mani, $35.00 for a gel and $5.00 for nail art. Easy and simple... Just the way I like

Came in for a quick drink while friends of our gambled near by. It has an inviting atmosphere, cute waitresses and service was quick. They offer a pretty extensive list of speciality drinks (and 4 different kinds of bloody Mary's, my fav). I will def be back in the future. P.S did I mention Aria smells amazing! Vanilla yummy

I was really excited when I moved to The Residences on High Street... I loved the location, and the high quality of the apartments. Very quickly though, did the excitement turn into complete and utter disappointment and frustration.  After paying what I was paying for a two-bedroom apartment, which in all honesty could have afforded me a very nice home in Scottsdale, the caliber of professionalism and service that was afforded to me as nothing less of horrendous.  Upon moving into the apartment in the beginning of December 2015, I noticed that my flooring was bubbling up, I informed the community manager Erica George who had their maintenance Joe come up and look at the flooring. The initial visit to the apartment Joe had agreed that the flooring in fact needed to repaired, but he would have to wait until Erica returned to the country. Fast forward to the middle of January and the issue had not been addressed, I informed Erica that our flooring had not been fixed yet and what the hold up was. Joe then came back to the apartment several WEEKS later and decided after that visit that somehow the bubbling in the floor was normal. Seriously?! Erica was then brought into the picture and agreed that the flooring needed to be repaired and that she would have Joe fix it.... Let me tell you, by the time I moved out in April, the flooring had still not been repaired, as well as the light bulbs that had gone out in my unit.   The Cowboy bar across the street from their units is so loud on the weekends, I was woken up regularly from the noise of their patrons. At the time I vacated High Street, I could count at least 10 units that had left due to various issues with management there.   Also, it has been nearly a month now since I vacated and I have yet to receive any of my deposit/rent back. Getting Erica George to do anything is impossible.   So if your looking to live in a community that does not take care of their residents, is poorly run by management then high street is the place for you. I am so disappointed by my experience with this specific property.

"You gave Denny's a 5-star review, so you probably couldn't afford to live here" - Erica George, PB Bell Property Manager of High Street.   That is the harassing message I woke up to yesterday morning from High Streets quality and professional management. First off, sue me I eat at Denny's on occasion, it's fast, the food is consistent, they treat me with respect and the bacon is always crispy and the eggs are always perfect and it costs me under $5.00.  If I could give the residences zero stars I would. Since my initial post about my experience there, things have only gotten worse.   The management at high street and let's be honest PB Bell, are some of the most incompetent individuals I have ever run across in my life. I am astounded that PB Bell is even in business.   Since my initial post things have only gotten worse:  First off, I personally never got any information in regards to repairs or cleaning fee's personally from Erica George. Legally, she had 30 days to get me that information and she never did. I ended up finding out that she had sent that information over to my new apartment complex that I had transferred my lease and the new property manager ended up providing the information to me.   When looking though it I notice an astounding $800.00 charge for new carpeting - um excuse me, I lived on high street from December to April, there is no possible way I damaged the carpeting in the master bedroom or the second bedroom to the point of no repair in 5 months. Upon questioning Erica George about the charge she said my dogs had destroyed the carpet and it had to be replaced, after emailing with her back and forth for what feels like eternity she finally provided "documentation" of the damages. She sent me two photos: one of the carpet in my master bedroom and the second of carpet pulled up with horrendous staining on the bottom of the carpet. The shocking thing is that the second picture of the stains wasn't even from my apartment. So, the charges were totally fraudulent.   Upon review of those pictures, PB Bell corporate was called and Heather Garcia who is Erica George's manager refused to even entertain looking at the pictures. She simply stated that if Erica said there was damage, she was going with Erica. You would think if a customer is saying there are fraudulent charges you may want to look into that since fraud is illegal. No one returns phone calls from corporate, heck they don't even pick up their phones. They allow management to act like children without any repercussions. If I behaved like any of them at work, I would be fired.   I don't think my complaints in general have been out of line.   - Fix my flooring in a timely manner like you promised - Don't fraudulently charge me $800.00 for replacement carpet.  - Treat me with Respect and don't harass me online  The kicker to all of this is, I ran into one of my neighbors who was having issues with Erica as well, and he told me they charged him 800.00 for new carpeting as well. Must be Erica's MO, I wonder if she is getting a kick back from the so called third party vendor.   Super frustrating - So I am in the process of getting an attorney and taking this so much further. It's not about the money at this point, it's about the fact that they haven't treated me with an ounce of respect.

Don't let the strip mall location fool you, Le Chalet has some seriously good food! They serve swiss/french specialities, think Crepes and fondu! The interior isn't anything to write home about, but really who cares when you have food as good as they do!  Their beer sampler is insane. A few of the standouts through out the night was their Table Side French Raclette which is a plate served with 4 different kinds of cold cuts with a basket of steamed potatoes, but the best part of the whole entree was the fact that they served it with this amazing cheese they melted table side! So yummy! The Hanging Man which is another one of their house specialties. Beef Tenderloin served flameed  table side with rice and several dipping sauces. All of their Crepes were to die for as well.  Portions were huge and big enough to share and prices weren't too outrageous.  Worth a trip if your looking for something different.

I came and stayed here for a girlfriends wedding that was up the street at McCormick ranch. What a disappointment this place was. Service was horrible, and when I say horrible it was horrendous. There was a loud room across from me during my stay, security was called at 4:00am two nights in a row. I asked to move rooms, they said I couldn't be accommodated. I placed a request to have my room made up at 8:00am and by 3:00pm it hadn't been touched. My girlfriend who was getting married and had a suite as well asked to have her room cleaned early in the morning, same outcome as mine.  Front desk service was horrible, the manager was rude rude rude! Friends of ours were checking in, asked for an early check in... When they went to check in the front desk manager stated she wouldn't help and there wasn't anything she could do about it. Customer service is obviously not a priority of theirs, and because of that I will not ever come back here or recommened this establishment to any of my friends.

Ernie's is def one of the better dive bars I have been to in Scottsdale - bartenders were super friendly, the have tons of fried greasy food to soak up your booze when you've been busy drinking and working up an appetite singing karaoke. The crowd is super fun and friendly and drink prices are cheap!

I love True Food Kitchen - There is nothing better or should I say more reassuring than walking into a restaurant and seeing a kitchen that is full of beautiful and fresh produce! Such an amazing concept to have an open kitchen that allows patrons to see their food being prepared fresh! It has such a great vibe and a big reason alone I love this place! I know that when I dine at True Food Kitchen that I will be not only getting really fantastic food, but I know that it's fresh!   Their menu is full of fresh and seemingly healthy options - and It's all great tasting too! The several times I have been here I usually opt for a Kale Aid juice, which is freshly juiced and might I add delicious concoction of  Kale, Apple, Cucumber, Celery, Lemon & Ginger. It reminds me of a drink that I used to get at Pressed Juicery in Malibu CA! The Edamame Dumplings are fresh and tasty - the only criticism I would give is that the truffle oil really over powers the beautiful flavor of the edamame, I think in the future I would opt for the dumplings minus the Truffle Oil.  But the absolute best thing on the menu would be the Panang Curry! It rivals some of my favorite and might I add authentic Thai joints in Los Angeles....  it's full of Brown Rice, Potato, Broccoli, Ginger, Carrot, Mushroom & a beautiful and flavorful Coconut Shellfish Broth.   It's a great addition to the Arizona food scene and if your in the area and looking for a healthy and casual but still trendy option, True Food is for you!

WOW! Best brunch EVER. Words simply can not describe how absoutley fantastic the food was. For $20.12 you get a wonderful 3 course meal We were a pretty good sized party and they accommodated us, and service was great. Decor was beautiful but understated. I think the highlight of the entire restaurant is the HUGE display of fresh fish. They seemed to have an extensive wine list as well.

Every weekend my friends and I hit up citizen public house after we work on restoring my friends airstream... I love their happy hour - everything has been amazing (minus their ramen, it's spicy but is missing any flavor profile) and I always have to get their original chopped salad with double salmon! Their barrel aged cocktails are delicious as well.

I've been to Eddie V's twice now recently... Both times my experiences have been less that stellar. I'm bummed about it because so many people I know have such amazing things to say about their experiences there. I don't know if I just went on a couple of off nights, but for their price point I was hoping for a stellar experience.   on both experiences, we encountered hostesses who weren't friendly and on the second visit got a very snotty comment when I told her my name for the reservation. It took for a good 15 minutes to seat us and explanation as to why we were all standing around.   Service the second time was horrible... We dined on a weeknight and our server was really trying to rush us to turn the table. It was obvious to all of us. We ordered some apps, I loved their Kung Pao Calamari and the chilled seafood tower was delicious as well.   The frustrating thing is that our entrees came out rather quickly after our apps - even though we specifically told our waiter that we were celebrating that evening and to hold our entrée order until we were nearly done with the apps. And to add fuel to the fire, a couple of our steaks were severely overcooked.  He dropped our check without even asking if we wanted dessert. Super frustrating experience.

Butters Pancakes & Cafe is a solid breakfast spot in Scottsdale. The place is usually slammed on the weekends but honestly it's worth the wait, grab a coffee and relax in the usually insanely perfect Arizona weather.   I got their Corned Beef hash skillet which was super good - it came with hash browns, jack and cheddar cheese and 2 eggs of my choice. It's served with Pancakes or toast, I ordered the pancake which I was thrilled about because the pancake was perfection!   My friend got the eggs verde which was corn tortilla, black beans, jack cheese, 2 eggs (any style), and topped with green new mexico chile sauce. Served with hash browns or grits. They were super thrilled with their selection as well.   Coffee was good and they have fresh squeezed OJ as well!  Def worth a visit if your looking for some solid breakfast food!

What girl doesn't love being pampered and feeling confident and beautiful? I know I do... Which is really simply why I LOVE Drybar. Weather it be a special occasion, a lazy hair day or just a special treat to myself, I know that I will always leave the drybar with an amazing blowout/style that will last throughout the evening but It won't set me back an arm and a leg ($40.00)!

Came here the other day with a couple of girlfriends for Sunday Brunch! Service was excellent, I really enjoyed my smoked salmon Benedict (around $12.00), their waffle breakfast looked really yummy and the portion size was HUGE! prices were average but I was super impressed with their weekend Bloody Mary and mimosa special which is $3.00 all weekend long!  Great spot for a quick and casual breakfast or lunch!

I love Thai Basil Signature, not only is the food delicious but service is always spot on. I am a sucker for good spring rolls, that thin deep fried tofu skin, the rice noodles, and veggies... and let me tell you theirs don't disappoint. Their peanut (panag) curry is yummy and I adore their pad see ew noodles! My go to local Thai joint!

Came here with a girlfriend for a quick lunch. We were quickly greeted and seated. We ordered the Mista salad to start with and monte bianco. When our salad arrived we were delivered the wrong salad - don't get me wrong the salad we received was good but it wasn't what we ordered, then our pizza came.... THE WRONG PIZZA CAME! Both times we told the food runner and he looked mortified, but told us it would take a bit for the new pizza to cook so we just ate the other pizza.   I am still dumb founded that we ordered two things and both things were wrong - they weren't even busy. But what we did receive was really good - So i just don't know if we caught them on an off day or what, but I would be willing to try it again, I just better get the food I order next time ;)

I love Dunkin Donuts - They have seriously good coffee, their larges are super gulps of lattes (which being the coffee whore I am, I love it!) and aren't pricey at all! They obviously have good donuts, but their breakfast sandwiches are pretty amazing as well. But I mostly love the fact that it's a drive through and I don't have to drag my lazy butt out of my car to get my coffee and carb fix!

I have had the opportunity to travel all over the world and not only eat some amazing food, but some seriously fresh and amazing sushi. After moving back to the valley of the sun I never in a million years thought that I would encounter some seriously amazingly fresh and might I add authentic sushi.   I came here and was lucky enough to have had the opportunity to try the omakase menu. Each course was better than the next. Fish was beyond fresh, presentation was magical and service was spot on. I couldn't have asked for a better meal, I still have dreams about that particular evening that I was able to enjoy my dinner at ShinBay. I will def be back and if you haven't ever been... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!!!!?!!!!

Stingray used to be my go to sushi joint... I don't know what's happened to make them go down hill so fast! The last two times I have been there the food has been mediocre at best, service totally so-so and felt beyond rushed. And on my last visit I had to send our Yellowtail roll back because it was so fishy that I had a serious concern for my health. The waitress seemed annoyed that we wanted to send it back and didn't want to replace it with a new roll.  On the upside, if there really is one is that they have one of the best happy hours around. Which honestly is the only reason I have been back. Oh and they have amazing cocktails, my fav is the Kiwi Collins.   I just wish that they would improve the quality of their food and their the attitudes of their servers.

I will admit I am a coffee fanatic! Not a Starbucks sugar loaded typical addict but a true  connoisseur of delicious coffee. I recently had the opportunity to travel to Australia. I swear on my dogs life it's worth a nearly 16 hour flight for Coffee in Melbourne. There is no replicating it, I came home seriously ruined. I came home seriously worried that no coffee joint would compare, and let's be honest I don't add sugar, maybe a little warm milk and I love my flat whites! So sorry Starbucks, my coffee bean farewell because Cartel Coffee has become my official go to joint! My flat white was smooth and creamy, it l didn't need an ounce of sweetener. It was so good I came back for seconds!  So Cartel coffee lives up to the hype - no joke

I love Pita Jungle, it's fresh healthy food, service is always fantastic and you seriously can't beat their happy hour every day from 3-6pm! My fav item on the menu is their Wood-fired salmon salad served with mixed greens, roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers in a lemon vinaigrette. It's light, but filling and there is zero guilt after eating it!  Their Greek Gyro is pretty phenomenal as well. It has broiled beef & lamb marinated with spices and herbs, served in a Greek pita with mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tzatziki.   If your looking for a delicious and healthy alternative then Pita Jungle is worth stopping by!

I came here this past weekend to watch a football game - Honestly I had never been to Twin Peaks until then so I had NO IDEA about their hootersesque vibe. Cute girls all dressed like mountain men, proudly displaying their uhhh well Twin Peaks! Perfect place for the boys to watch whatever sport they like and to ogle at the cute girls working there. Food wasn't bad - totally your typical bar food. I was obsessed with their spicy queso dip with the taco meat added, plus was they totally refilled our chips without even asking! I ordered their bloody mary which was legit, it even came with a slice of bacon. Loved when they asked my friend if he wanted a man sized or girl sized beer - perfection!

I work right next door to Tom Thumb Fresh Market - It's my go to spot for lattes, gummy bears for an afternoon snack and when the boss isn't keeping me tied to my desk I love to come here for lunch and enjoy some delicious BBQ.  Toms Market is a neat place in North Scottsdale, Not only do they offer car washes, gas and good bbq but it's also a neat spot to stop by for a cool gift for someone

So first things first - It's a revolving sushi bar and the sushi rolls are anywhere from $1.50 to $5.00 a roll. The rolls aren't anything super fancy and most of them include some form of krab mix, something deep fried and or a creamy sauce. It's not a high end Nobu joint where you are getting really beautiful, fresh cuts of fish.... But frankly if you are craving sushi and don't want to break the bank I would totally recommend Sushi Station. Also, If eating food off of a revolving sushi belt isn't your thing, you can order your sushi fresh from their menu.

Last night my boyfriend and I were headed out to go see a movie and wanted a quick bite to eat before, I am a sushi junkie so we decided to try Sakura Sushi. We walked in and were seated very quickly but that was really where the positive ended in our experience.   We ordered both a meal from the dinner menu - The Kalbi Beef, we were charged a split plate charge when we never requested it (an additional $7.95), the beef was dry and beyond salty.   We then ordered items from their sushi menu, All of which were okay, typical california sushi, not very high quality.   We were waiting for additional food items to be served when our waitress comes over and asks us if we are ready for our check when half of our food hadn't been delivered. We asked her if the rest of our food was going to be delivered, and about 5 minutes later everything else was delivered. It was obvious that she had made a mistake and I wish she would have acknowledged it, to make matters worse the wait staff just kept pushing our dirty dishes to the side of the table never clearing the dirty dishes as more food came to our table.   Service was beyond poor, which was disappointing since our meal was over $100.00

Being a Thai food junkie and a Los Angeles transplant, finding an awesome and might I add relatively authentic Thai joint has been a tad bit difficult here in the Valley of the Sun... Thankfully with a little digging I ran past some awesome articles about this joint so it was placed on the top of my list of must try restaurants!  It's a bit of a trek for me, but it was well worth it. The service was amazing, they were friendly and helpful without being over bearing! We ordered a bit of everything, and it was all amazing. Prices were super cheap for the quality and amount of food you get, I had days of leftovers and left full! They even gave us free desert (green tea ice cream!!!!!!)  I will be back!

I was fortunate enough to find brown bag lunches on a whim! I found myself in a bit of a pickle when the caterer I was using, who will remain unnamed totally screwed me over. I was referred to Lisa (the owner) who reassured me she would be able to handle everything! Keep in mind this was a large event with multiple dietary restrictions with only 2 days notice. Fast forward to the day of the event, she showed up on time, über professional and friendly. Everyone was raving about the food and service! I will be using Lisa at brown bag lunches for all of my catering needs! And don't let the name fool you, this girl is a culinary master and trained at Le Cordon bleu!

Arguably one of the better dry bars I have been to - My stylist was Katie who was adorable and knew exactly what I wanted and was able to make my hair dream a reality!  Love going there and watching the girly movies on TV , getting pampered and leaving looking great and ready for a night on the town!

Since my triumphant return to the valley of the sun, I had made a list of restaurants that were a must try and Gadzooks Enchiladas & Soup was at the top of that list! This place is similar to chipotle in concept but the quality of food doesn't even compare.   Being a newbie to the joint - I asked the guy behind the counter to make me what he usually eats. I think this is the best thing to do sometimes, It's fun to try things that other people recommend.   So of course I had to try the Enchiladas, I got one house corn and one made from scratch half n' half corn flour tortilla filled with green chilie prok shoulder and a sweet corn type filling in the other, I went christmas style and got the red and green sauce and asadero cheese, topped the sucker with a griddled fried egg and guac, salsa verde, with a little scratch made cream, crumbled cotija cheese, and pickled red onions!  Seriously delicious - and not pricey at all.... I can't wait for it to be soup weather so I can try their tortilla soup!   So, simply why should you come here?! - Fresh homemade ingredients - Huge portions, and great prices - Amazingly friendly and helpful staff - And there is booze  A must try!

The ChopShop is by far one of my favorite dining establishments in the valley. They offer healthy and high quality food, with a pretty wide variety of options that range from healthy green juices, protein shakes, salads, sandwiches and protein plates! The atmosphere here really reminds me of Urth Cafe in Los Angeles, it's a really organic, earthy coffee shop feeling with both indoor and outdoor seating options. It can get pretty slammed during lunch hours so if your strapped for time I would recommend calling in and order ahead of time!   A few of my fav items here are the Kale Cesar Salad, The Tri Tip and the Shrimp protein Plate, both plates are served with their super healthy and might I add yummy black forbidden rice and a generous helping of roasted broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, onions and mushrooms. I was really impressed with the quality of the steak and shrimp that they have and honestly the size of the shrimp they serve. Juice wise I love their Power Green Juice which has Kale, cucumber, celery, apple, ginger, parsley and lemon.   When I am in the area and looking for a healthy and quick lunch option this is my go to spot!

Honestly whats not to love about Phoenix Open? Golf, booze, girls trying to walk on grass in stiletto heels, drunk girls just simply trying to walk or stand up for that matter! Drunk dudes trying to pick up on said drunk girls who can't stand up! Year after year the Phoenix open seems to never disappoint!

I have been wanting to try Humble Pie for sometime now - finally tonight a close girlfriend and her daughter had suggested that we meet up for some happy hour fun. They have a great happy hour selection of both apps and drinks. We ordered the toasted cheese ravioli, a cheese pizza, their fries and deep fried green beans! All of which were amazing bar food. I ordered their Jalapeño infused bloody mary which was pretty good.  I am still looking forward to checking this place out for dinner and trying one of their speciality pies! But simply as a happy hour joint I was super stoked!

Nori may be on of my new favorite sushi places in Phoenix... I was a bit skeptical walking in here the other night and had pretty low expectations because of its location in Desert Ridge. But alas I was pleasantly surprised and had an absolutely fantastic meal here - drinks, food and service were all on point!   For dinner we ordered a bit of everything -  We started off with some Nigiri, Tuna, Salmon and yellowtail. All 3 selections featured surprisingly fresh fish and the rice was cooked perfectly. It wasn't gummy and didn't fall apart.  The Seaweed salad was solid. For rolls we ordered a Poki Poki which featured their house speciality tuna poke and crab. It was recommended by our server as one of her favorites and she didn't disappoint. Soft Shell Crab roll was flavorful as was the Salmon Skin roll. We ordered a bottle of their unfiltered Sake which was placed in an ice bucket on the table to ensure that it was kept cool and their Strawberry lemonade Martini was to die for!   I will def be back!

Reasons Modern Margarita is amaze balls!  1) Their Margaritas are ridiculously good... fresh, delicious, and quite dangerous if consumed in high quantities during HH   2) I love their tacos - so much so that it wasn't too long ago that I was dared to consume their 15 taco flight, I did... Made Adam Richman from Man Vs. Food proud!  3) I still want to eat their tacos after my infamous 15 taco consumption challenge  4) Their happy hour is one of the best in town  5) Service is always spot on... Never ever have I ever had a grumpy waiter/ waitress/ bartender/ hostess... you get the point  So.... there you go my friends, 5 reasons why Modern Margarita should be on your list of places to go for Taco Tuesday, Margarita Mondays, Tequila Thursdays, Salty Saturdays, Sloppy Sundays, Fajita Fridays (so what if they don't serve Fajitas) or Wasted Wednesdays!

Dear Cuttlefish,    I am sorry we got off on the wrong foot... I was all wrong about you! I am so happy that I decided to give you a second chance, and you beyond redeemed yourself! If you read my first review I didn't have such a stellar experience, It wasn't bad per say but it wasn't what I was expecting! So, I was hoping that the second time around would be better and it was!  This time around we went and ordered another bottle of my now favorite wine Sexual Chocolate, it's a Syrah - Zinfandel blend and it's frankly to die for. The bottle runs around $65.00 and they offer it by the glass as well at I believe $16.00.  This go around we decided to order an assortment of their appetizers, and I was frankly blown away by nearly all of them. The only one I wouldn't order again would be the Spicy Tuna Pops. The tuna itself was amazing, super fresh and really flavorful. The waffle cone that it arrived in didn't exactly compliment the fish.   Other items that we ordered and LOVED were the dozen oysters, we got an assortment of the oysters they had that particular day and they were fresh and this time around there wasn't a trace of shell in any of the oysters! WOOHOO!  The Crispy Cuttlefish was one of my fav items that evening - The only way to describe it is that it is very similar to calamari but frankly it's better than calamari. It doesn't have that rubbery texture to it and it was fried to perfection and the lemon aioli was the perfect compliment to it.   Cuttlefish's take on a wedge salad is what dreams are made of! I love wedge salads but I usually am not a huge fan of the iceberg lettuce since it really has zero taste or nutritional value to it. The bibb lettuce was a welcome change of pace and the crispy pancetta, and avocado was a nice  addition.   The pork  belly, the Carlsbad Mussels, Shrimp and grits I could just go on and on! Had the opportunity to meet Joey one of the owners who was very friendly, and I was really impressed when I learned that he actually cooks in the kitchen there. I love that he is a hands on owner and it shows that he has a real investment in the establishment!   Def worth checking out if your in the mood for some fabulous seafood, and if you love oysters and champagne Wednesday's are 1/2 priced oysters and champagne nights and they had some great live music!

I love the Whining Pig so much that there is a huge part of me that doesn't want to write a yelp review. I happily stumbled across The Whining Pig on yelp a couple of weeks ago and have been wanting to check the place out ever since! Unfortunately my friends are all losers so I took myself on a date to The Whining Pig for Happy Hour! The thought of checking out a Wine/Beer Bar alone would be daunting, but whatever I decided to just go for it! I had such a great time, I happened to sit next to a super friendly Phoenix Fireman who kept me entertained for a few hours, Greg the ever friendly owner recommended a fantastic Chardonnay (that I might add was $5.00 for happy hour) and was friendly enough to open a Blonde ale beer to let me try since beer frankly scares me!  I can't wait to go back and partake is some trivial pursuit, listen to some awesome music and drink fantastic wine!

Ok - I am confused about the hype of Cornish Pasty Co. Staff wasn't friendly nor helpful, we stood in the entry walking around for several minutes looking lost and confused (they were empty) and no one acknowledged us until I finally acknowledged them. I ordered the bangers and mash pasty which was blah, no flavor - tons of potatoes but no meat - whats up with that? The chicken liver pate was delish though.  The real kicker is that I got sick off of their food that evening - Super disappointed since they were one of the restaurants on my places I needed to check out in the Valley.

Having moved here from Los Angeles and being addicted to green juices and going through withdrawal from my usual juice joint Pressed Juicery, I was looking for a place to fill that void and Nekter def fit the bill. The interior is adorable and very organic, the only thing I didn't like was that they have fruits and veggies displayed and they are plastic, kinda takes away from that whole fresh/healthy and organic feel.  They have a pretty wide assortment of fresh Juices and healthy snacks. I got the greenie, which I loved. It was pretty pricey though, more than I am used to paying.

I really wanted to like this place... I love mediterranean food and I think the concept is great (think chipotle meets pitas!) but execution was seriously off! I went and ordered the build your own entree and got the falafel. There were tons of choices to add on to my order and most of them were really great, but honestly their falafel was inedible. If I hadn't ordered it to go I would have taken it back, but instead I was stuck with falafels that could be utilized better by the Phoenix Coyotes as hockey pucks rather than a protein that is offered by an establishment offering fresh and healthy fare. Needless to say I was a bit turned off by my experience and I don't think I will be back. Next time I need my mediterranean fix I will head to Pita Jungle.

I love Erika's coffee dock - They have amazing coffee, fresh salads and sandwiches but the service that I get here is what keeps me coming back week after week! The owners who run this little gem are quite possibly two of the warmest and most welcoming people I have ever met! They always go out of their way to make sure that your sandwich is exactly the way you want it and they always do it with a smile!

Having grown up in the valley of the sun I have lost count the amount of times I have driven past Pink Pony. For whatever reason, this weekend was the first time I had tried it. I thought since they had remodeled it, it would be the perfect time to try it! So this past weekend when my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to check out, we decided on Pink Pony since he was as curious as I was.  We made a reservation for 7:30 on open table, when we arrived we were greeted by a friendly hostess. We were sat in a booth in the bar where it was extremly loud. Why they sat us in there I will never know, there were open tables all over the resturant. Everytime someone got out of the booth behind me my seat would move, not wiggle but legitimately move. We were greeted by our friendly waitress, she was knowledgeable of the menu, and offered several recomendations.   We ordered the Wood Fired Octopus as an app and a Romaine salad. Both came out at the same time super fast which was kind of annoying. We had ordered a 36 ounce ribeye to share and we were told that it would take 40 minutes to cook, so the spacing of the food was slightly questionable.   The Octopus was ok but not great -  it was Spanish Octopus, Garbanzo Bean Puree, Chives, Crispy Garbanzo Beans - Olive Oil, Salumi Butter and Banyuls Vinegar. It was slightly chewy and need some sort of acid on it - I squeeze of lemon would wake this dish up quite a bit.  $13.00  The Romaine salad consited of baby romaine, parmesan  country bread croutons, crispy white anchovy and a citrus & parmesan vinaigrette. Again the salad was ok - the croutons was still pretty chewy, the vinaigrette was lacking a bit. It wasn't bad it just wasnt great. $9.00  As I said above we ordered the 36oz Bone in Ribeye to share which came with 2 beers for $85.00. Since neighter of us drink beer we asked if they would subsitute something else for the beers, which they did without any hesitation, which was nice. We had asked for our steak to be cooked med rare plus, when it came it was so over cooked that it was almost like eating cardboard. We debated for a good 5 minutes on weather we should say something because we had already waited 40 minutes for the steak and we were both pretty hungry. So we ate it err he ate it.   I finally said something to our waitress - the manager came over and said oh it looks like several of the outer areas of your steak were cooked more well done. And told us that was normal. We informed him that the entire steak well done and not med rare like we had asked for. I get it we were eating it but that doesn't make it ok. He offered us free desert.   I just don't understand how that steak even left the kitchen. There was ZERO quality control. Between the cook, and the waitress someone should have noticed this steak wasn't even cooked closely to how we had asked.   I was super disappointed with my meal here and wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone. $150.00 down the drain.   Bummer

I am a sucker for some good Indian food.... well really, any kind of ethnic food! I have always heard some amazing things about Marigold Maison and when I finally had the opportunity to try this place I knew I had to go!  A few must trys! Their Samosa Chaat - which is a samosa with chickpea, onion, tomato, mint, yogurt, & tamarind. It's delicious and almost a deconstructed Samosa! The chicken tikka was delicious, as was their lamb Goan Vindaloo, made with wine, red chilis, curry leaves, and mustard seeds! Their naan was a knock out as well!  Highly recommend Marigold Maison

I recently started a new job which meant finding a new spot for lunch... 1 week in and I think I found my place! Walking in I was greeted by one of the owners Jerry. The Brown Bag is a family owned business and is run by a father and his daughter (how awesome is that!). He runs the front of the house and she is back in the kitchen! Having never been there before, I asked Jerry for his recommendations, He gave me 4 solid recommendations (The Health Nut, The Chicken Salad, The Caprese, and the Snapshot),  all sounded delectable but I decided to go with the Snapshot.   Seriously, let me tell you this - The Snapshot is quite possibly one of best sandwiches I have ever had. It's a hot sandwich with delicious turkey, melted swiss cheese, tomato and avocado smothered with a srirachca sauce on a warm ciabatta bun! What more could you ask for?!  Not only is the food great, But as people came in to pick up stuff to go, he knew a fair amount of the peoples names and preferences. It doesn't get any better than that!  I firmly believe is supporting family run businesses, but when you have the opportunity to not only support a family run business, but one that is run with pure love and passion like brown bag is, it's a no brainer!  So if your looking for a salad/sandwich/wrap that is simply out of this world paired with killer customer service, The Brown Bag is your place! I know it's mine.

I love Diego Pops, such an awesome and welcome addition to Old Town Scottsdale. It has good food, a fun and whimsical atmosphere without the attitude.   Food has always been pretty stellar, not mind blowing but pretty flippin awesome! Think your usual small joint taco fare with a few additions that take it over the top... think fresh poke bowls and honestly no visit is really complete without an order of their in my own opinion famous Brussels sprout nachos; yes I just said what you think I did, and seriously I get what is going through your mind but somehow they make brussels sprouts and nachos work. No joke, these are not your mothers Brussels sprouts doused in nasty cheese. Just try them and you can send me a thank you card later.   So go.... go on Margarita Mondays, Taco Tuesday, Wasted Wednesday, Tequila Thursdays you get my drift, any night is a good night for Diego Pops!

LOVED SPIGA CUCINA!!!!!!!  Spiga Cucina is possibly one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley. The restaurant itself is beautiful, I can't wait to visit again and sit outside on their patio once Summer 2015 leaves us! Our server was amazing, really helpful, and offered us some amazing recommendations.   We started out with the Calamari di "sara", the calamari was coated in a light breading and served with arugula, lemon-caper vinigrette, tomato remoulade. I love it and would def try it again. Next time I am looking forward to trying the Polpo alla griglia which is their grilled octopus, one of the tables next to us ordered it and it looked amazing and they said it was phenomenal.   Entree wise I ordered the linguini nero ( I subbed out the linguini for the pappardelle pasta!)  - it was literally over flowing with shrimp, clams, calamari, scallops with roasted red pepper, tomato, shallot and spicy sugo. for $22.00 it was a steal, I don't think I have ever dined at an establishment that put sooo much seafood in my pasta! I was in Heaven.   I can't totally remember what my dining companions got, but I know they all enjoyed every single bite! So if yours looking for a place that has amazing food and stellar service Spiga Cucina is your spot!

I can't tell you how many times i've driven past AZ Kabob House... Recently after a long Saturday morning workout, I was looking for something that was healthy but different from my usual salad joints.   The restaurant itself is cute and airy, our cashier was super sweet and attentive. We started with an order of their hummus which was creamy and delicious... I got a greek salad with a ground beef kabob. The Salad was flavorful and the kabob was delicious as well. It was quick, delicious, and price was on point.  Def a great spot for delicious and quick persian food!

Having lived here in the Valley for pretty much my entire life (minus that 10 year stint in Los Angeles) it's been awesome to see the evolution of not just Terminal 4 but of Sky Harbor! When I travel; and I do pretty often I am always excited when It's out of Terminal 4. Security is usually pretty efficient and friendly; which lets be honest is a rarity these days in air travel. There are a ton of food options both before you enter security and once your by the gates, Think Cowboy Ciao, Zinc Brasserie, Barrio Café, Chelsea's Kitchen, Joe's Real BBQ, Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles, Delux and Matt's Big Breakfast.   Love the changes and love traveling out of Sky Harbor

I def love Mad Greens - They have delicious, fresh and creative salads. There is a salad for everyone! Weather your the steak salad type, the quinoa lover, or the vegan! I will admit they are a tad pricey - think around $11.00 for a salad. I am a huge fan of the Siam I am Salad with Shrimp and the Don Quixote Salad is quite delicious as well!  Def a great spot for a quick and healthy lunch!

I am a huge fan of Crudo, so when I heard about Okra I knew I had to try it! So when I popped online and checked out their menu and saw Fried Chicken Skins with Honey Hot Sauce, I knew this was going to be a dangerous love affair. I mean seriously lets all be honest here... The best part of the fried chicken is that delicious crunchy exterior that has been deep fried to golden perfection! I mean if it wasn't, why would we order fried chicken and not just eat a boring chicken breast.... anyways getting off point here.  The restaurant itself is nice and modern, we sat on the patio since it was a beautiful spring night. Service was amazing (make sure you ask for Michelle!), cocktails were killer (old fashioned was on point but the real winner was the sazerac)  Being the fatties we are we ordered a plethora of food - because why not try it all! Obviously we ordered the fried chicken skins with the hot honey sauce, which is a must. The oysters al griglia were a serious home run! The conspicuous amounts of butter and garlic in those tiny bad boys was what oyster dreams are made of. Those oysters can know that they died for a noble cause. The smoked chicken wings were good not great, and the bone marrow with biscuits and ox tail and pepper jam at what dreams are made of.   Their smoked ham hock is the the true stand out of the evening... braised, smokey, tender, are all words i can use to describe this dish. No need for a knife here - its literally a fall off the bone delectable treat,   And after all of this, we still ate dessert! Donuts. I ended my meal with a donut covered in more salted caramel than should be legal! Not that I am complaining. Next time I want to take that donut and cover it with a piece of their chicken skin.  So if your looking for killer food, great drinks and a fun atmosphere where you can take your taste buds on a wild food ride than should be street legal, Okra is your spot!

I am sure most of us have spent a drunken late night at Denny's, my go-to was Moon's Over My Hammy (how appropriate!)... Now that those drunken fueled college days are over and I am currently attempting this thing called adulting (it's way over-rated!) the only times you will find me at a Denny's these days are on two occasions, Road trips and Sunday mornings.  They do a solid breakfast - I'm a simple girl, I usually go with two scrambled eggs, bacon and a pancake. It's always super yummy!  This particular location is super clean and updated and service is always stellar. Now if only they served Bloody Mary's and mimosas!

Who woulda thought that I would find a pretty solid bowl of Pho in the Paradise Valley Mall food court? This obviously family owned and ran establishment is definitely worth checking out if your looking for some different food court fare... The broth was flavorful, my meatballs were delicious and service was spot on!

To say my experience at Egg and Joe was disappointing would be an understatement... I was stoked about a month ago when their marketing manager sent me a message inviting me to their friends and family night, because of work I wasn't able to make it but it got the joint in my head! So this morning when looking for a brunch joint a light bulb went off in my head!   We got there and there was a wait, not surprised since it was a Sunday morning at 11:30, we were quoted 20 minute wait time... We waited eagerly and were finally sat. At that point I was starving and looking forward to breakfast ASAP!   Upon sitting down we both knew what we wanted and we ordered our Omelette and a skillet breakfast, as soon as we ordered the waitress told me the kitchen was backed up as long as 45 minutes. Umm ok - so it would have been helpful for the hostess to tell us that it was really almost a hour wait for a table and food!   So we sat and sat and the table next to us who got there a good 10 minutes after us gets their food we were still sitting there waiting for our food. Then out comes our waitress, informing us she FORGOT to put our order in, ok things happen .. She assured us that she would get our food to us and take care of us.   Our food arrived shortly after - flavor wise it was mediocre at best, but it was good! If I wasn't dieting I would have tried their infamous and delicious looking German pancake.   We get our bill, still no manager has come out to talk with us, there was not a single item on our bill that had been taken care of - which I am surprised at since our waitress said she would do something. Heck, I am not looking for a comped meal, even not up charging me for my bacon would have been nice!   Really not a positive experience at all - kinda left a sour taste in my mouth. I don't know if I would recommend this place to friends. I am empathic that it's their opening weekend, but the fact that it was nearly two hours for us to be seated, and get our food and pay is insane for breakfast

I will admit that I am not a huge pizza person, so for me to give this place 5 stars that's saying something!  So, why would a non pizza lover chick give this place 5 stars? Well my friends let me fill you in.  - First of all and seriously most importantly - the service is always spectacular. Friendly and helpful staff!   - I can't tell you how many places that will let me load my pizza up like I do for the measly $10.00 they charge.  - The pizza is delicious... I mean it's made the way I want it so how could it not!  It's those few reasons that should draw you into this tasty pizza joint!

I came here after work with a girlfriend to celebrate my birthday on Saturday night. I have been wanting to come check out Postino's since they opened, since I love their other locations so much! I mean they serve basically two of my favorite things, wine and bruschetta!  Of course their wine and bruschetta boards were amazing, it was the HORRIBLE service we received from the closing indoor waitress that evening. Anytime we wanted anything we ended up having to flag down a server who was leaving (I can't remember his name, but he was wearing a camo button down that evening and he is the reason this is a 2 star review! He saved the day)... The only time we ever saw her again after our initial greeting from her was when she dropped off the check.  Come on Postino's I expect better service from you guys!

I have a severe weakness for Thai food - well lets get real, I have a weakness for any form of Asian Cuisine. I love how they just somehow make all of those interesting and complex flavors work together to marry into holy matrimony. So lo and behold the other day when I was yelp-stalking new businesses in the phoenix area this little gem pops on under "Hot & New". I was giddy with excitement and knew this was going to have to be explored in the very near future. That moment was Friday evening after a long week of work, I knew my tush wasn't leaving my couch that night other than to pick up some yummy food to-go and a bottle of wine!   This joint is about as hole in the wall as one could possibly get - like most awesome Asian/sushi restaurant's this joint meets all the criteria for awesome hole in the wall food.  1) It's located in one of the most random Strip malls in the area 2) It's teenie tiny - maybe 10 tables 3) They don't have a website 4) Family owned and run 5) Treat you like family service  The curries were out of this world - I still can't get over the amount of shrimp that was in my Panang Curry and the chicken in the green curry. Spice level was on point too.  The only part that I didn't love was the Chicken Dumplings - They were a little over cooked inside and out. But I am more of a fan of steamed dumplings and these were fried so I think it's just a personal preference.  I can't wait to try more from their menu!

I love Elite events, mostly because I get to eat way too much food, drink some yummy cocktails and most importantly I don't look like such a freak because everyone else is taking just as many pictures of their food as I am... Ok, well maybe not last night... I was on a mission to win the social media contest, I failed and I am pretty such I annoyed all of my instagram followers (sorry guys!).  I had been wanting to try Inchin's Bamboo Garden for some time, but in all fairness I was a little reluctant due to their yelp reviews... So lo and behold when I saw it pop up as an elite event I knew I had to go!  Dinner was served family style and there was a lovely assortment of food - there was so much that I seriously thought I was going to have to be rolled out of the restaurant. My fav dishes of the evening were the Crispy Chili Baby Corn and the fish hot garlic they were d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s!   We were provided with samples of two new cocktails they will be debuting in the next month.  :: See no evil was a rum based cocktail with freshly muddled blackberries and lime wedges, It's perfect if you like your cocktails a little on the sweeter side. :: Spice Trader was a bourbon based cocktail made with fresh lemon juice, freshly muddled jalapeno and peach schnapps. It was pretty spicy but had a nice balance of sweetness from the peach schnapps.  I will def be back to check this place out again in the future, thank you again to Inchin's Bamboo Garden for allowing us foodie freaks into your restaurant and Hailey kudos for yet another successful event!
