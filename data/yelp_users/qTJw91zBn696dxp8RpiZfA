Tempura, service, and beer special good... quality of product BAD!!! Not worth the value.

This is the best example of " word  of mouth" marketing  I have ever experienced. I remember watching Jimmy Fallon one night and he mentioned pizzeria bianco and how he would fly to AZ just to try it. This means that the pizza in NY is really awfull or bianco is a God send. Look it's good pizza. Is the pizza so good that once you take a bite commit illegal activities to feed your habit  ??? No . It's good, fresh, and worth trying? The wait however is pretty much a deal breaker. Hey maybe they should allow tailgating in line.

The guy at the counter made me break a dollar to pay the penny when i pumped $30.01 This jerk made me sound like one of those janitor's with the huge key rings with all the change in my pocket because he wouldn't let me slide on one red cent. TOTAL DOUCHE!!!

Proof that you can market and sell anything with a catchy name. Lame happy hour, flavorless food, inattentive staff that's trying to look like an American apparel add. If this wasn't a Fox concept in the heart of Old Town it would of closed its doors 6 months ago.

Great job and very professional. Watched my house for a week while keeping an eye on the pets, watering the plants, and checking the mail. There was a good review of how the pets were during our vacation along with updates during outer vacation. Solid service for a great price.

Walked in and the place seemed cool, super busy on a Tuesday which is indicative of good food. So service was stretched and  they knew it. ,We've all been there and it happens, especially at popular places. Margarita was nothing special, but MASSIVE. The hair in my carnitas was special haha. It happens and its not worth blasting but they could be SOOO muchbetter if they tried.

very chill, great staff that pays attention but not too much attention (if that makes sense haha). Sweet corn tamale is the shiz and so are the pig wangz. Go there, supper tasty =).

This is the best BBQ in Phoenix that I have come across. The food is amazing (they run out of brisket pretty fast but the ribs and pastrami will blown your mind too). I can't say enough about how nice and friendly the people are which is alone worth a revisit.
