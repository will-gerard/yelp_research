I ordered a cake for my daughters graduation and going away party and they nailed it! Delicious and well designed, the University of Arizona/NYC theme was a hit! But most of all the customer service and communication were excellent! Thank you Jay and Tandra, very well done!

Was looking for a nice salon close to home to get my hair done... I found it two blocks from home! Very impressed with their team. Great customer service and super friendly. Kelley was awesome and the straight razor clean up was perfect! See you all in a few weeks!

Downtown living at it's best! The management team has been responsive and professional. The location is superb, the team here at 44 Monroe are friendly and helpful and the residents very welcoming! Now, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the views, these views are truly magnificent!!!! We are loving the sunsets and the splendor of the city at night! Urban living isn't for everyone but if it's your lifestyle then 44 Monroe is for you!

Looks aren't everything! Coming from a luxury condominium community just a few blocks away, I have definitely moved into a less luxurious community. The previous management team was less than impressive, condescending and not very forthcoming. We have since had a change in management companies and I would like to say things have improved... But they have actually worsened. If I would have been aware of the coming change I would not have chosen the Hawthorne. The units are nice, but as they say,  you can't judge a book by its cover. If you are looking for a one or two bedroom they will have vacancies come November and December as we will not be renewing our leases.

Do you think wine bars are sometimes stuffy and the staff a bit pretentious? Not the case at Central Wine. This charming and inviting wine bar in uptown Phoenix appeals to both the wine enthusiast and novice. No longer will you need to snap a picture of that bottle of wine you just fell in love with knowing you'll forget the name by morning. Now you can take it home with you! Well done Central Wine! Cheers!

I didn't get a chance to experience how good this place actually is. Turning away a potential client, especially one that lives and works in Downtown Phoenix is not good for business I don't care how good you think your business is.
