I have had the same gyn for since 2007. Since then I have only seen her 3 times. Everytime I go there the doctor is "at the hospital" or "on the phone".  I end up sitting for almost an hour everytime and get stuck seeing the nurse practitioner.!! !

I have been going here for years. It is nice but poorly managed !!  There is a 2 dog rule and people bring 3-5 dogs to one person.  They do NOTHING about the aggressive dogs that attack other dogs there !  People do not pick up their dog waste which can contribute to your dog getting sick.  There are rules at this park clearly posted but they are NOT followed and the People running that dog park DONT ENFORCE the rules. They could care less.

AJ Lydon is the best !! He finds EXACTLY what your looking for no matter how long it takes and keeps in contact with you during to search process.  A great ASSET to that dealership !!!

The food is way overpriced and it's not very good what I can say positively the service is better than the food. Don't waste your money

Coffee was awful !!  Tasted like it was there for days and the music is way too loud.  Should have gone to starbucks across the street.

This place is very nice and clean. Super friendly staff and when I pick my dog up she is worn out from playing.
