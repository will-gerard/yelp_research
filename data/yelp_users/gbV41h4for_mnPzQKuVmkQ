I showed up from Sacramento, California with high anticipation from reviews, reputation and recommendation.  Twenty dollar cab ride from the strip as we approach I'm thinking... uh are you sure this is it?  I'm reassured as I wait in a 70's strip mall for the door to open as other cabs and streams of people begin to show before the doors open on a Monday evening.  The chicken wings had to have one of the best flavors I've ever tasted on wings in my life.  I could sit there and eat enough of those alone to get sick to my stomach.  Service was on par as this place steadily filled up.  Dishes came out fast to our table and the owner came out and snapped a photo upon request from our table.  Hey I'm no Joe Montana but I took a picture just like he did.  They are so humble towards people from all over the world who come to eat their food.  Our table had some common dishes Americans are use to and everything met or exceeded expectations.  If you ever, ever are in Vegas and want Thai food this is the place.  They also have won consecutive national awards for their wine list.  I will remember this as champagne taste on a beer budget.  Absolute awesomeness!

Tried this place on my weekend trip to the area.  This place has the wow factor.  We pulled up Saturday night not knowing what to expect after seeing a line out the door and wrapped around the corner from the front entrance.  Got in line and saw the line reached some twenty yards to the service counter.  My nerves were settled as we got close enough to see cafeteria style serving vs. table serving was the call of the night.  Altogether the wait from start to finish couldn't have been more than twenty minutes and well worth it!        I had the half slab of ribs (6) with mac and cheese, BBQ pit beans, potato salad, and root beer float.  The ribs were cooked just right and the combination of self serve sauce was excellent.  Don't be afraid of the spicy sauce as the label is scarier than the actual kick of the sauce.  Beans were awesome and included meat in the beans to extract full flavor.  The mac and cheese as well as the potato salad did not disappoint as they were tasty.  My party of 8 who had tried this place for the first time were all pleased with not only the food but the prices.  This is the best BBQ for the price I've ever had.         The people of Gilbert and surrounding area are very fortunate to have an eating establishment like this.  I live in Sacramento, California and I will be back for more when I come to Arizona.  Finally something to rant and rave about in this area for dining!

NEVER AGAIN!  I'm thinking BANQUET microwave meals.  Nice service though!  Good atmosphere.  I just don't know what Arizonians are thinking other than the beer is cold!

Please never bring this chain to Northern California! The wings here are just about average, but nothing much to write home about.  The margarita pizza was just plain bland! Honestly I don't know what they could do differently to make it better. I feel like they warmed up a frozen pizza for our table.  I saw other entrees on tables across from me and I couldn't get excited about them either. Ugh I couldn't even figure out the theme of it was a sports bar or just a local hangout? I'll never stop here again for mediocre!

I loved every minute of my 2 and half hour eating frenzy.  This place is beautiful with an awesome selection of various food stations that include Asian, American, Mexican, Seafood, breads, pizza, deli meats, desserts, and more.  Bottomless mimosas are served with brunch on Sunday's.  If there is any buffet in Las Vegas you need to try this is it!  Every time I went to get more food my last dirty plate had already been removed from the table by the time I got back.  Bacchanal has buffet food and service down to a Science and I would recommend them to even the most pickiest and finicky eater.  You must experience this buffet.  The music they played made me happy and I ate to the tunes.  I could have very well experienced my first foodgasm.

And out of nowhere unsuspectingly a good slice of pizza at the airport. I have to say the several times I have chosen to eat a Phoenix airport has been better than any other food courts located in airports or malls.   It all started with a sample taste. Then I scurried about the terminal seeking other edibles. I came back to New York Pizza Dept and went for the whole slice. For a few bucks it was a steal of a deal to eat an an airport, and if you dare fly US Airways then you can cash in on this bonus too!

They've done a nice job with the decor. It's open, bright, and airy! Still kept the brick wall interior from 1926. They have a nice wrap around bar and ample seating.   The lunch special is just that, "special"! I had a nice salad and half tri tip sandwich with a 10oz beer for only $10 bucks. All the food I saw being served looked inviting. I also tried the smoked wings and they were so yummy! Habanero and Chipotle flavors...  I'll pass on their beer though, none of them really suited    my likings. I had a beer flight so I got some samplings and had the cherry porter with my lunch special.  If I'm ever back in this area I'd be hard pressed between choosing food and ambience over beer?

Ok so this review is based on my visit during the first weekend of opening. I was reluctant to stop, but I'm from out of town and my sister had heard about this place.   The Scottish Ale was so delicious! Kuddos to the brewmaster... It was so good in fact, I tried to come back the next day to get a growler, but was disappointed they didn't have their own growlers yet! Well I guess it was a 1 time experience for me since I live in California.   Don't forget to try some cheese too while you're here. They have a good selection of niblets, but don't expect a full kitchen offering appetizers or entrees.
