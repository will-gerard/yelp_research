Great place for dinner or lunch! Very diverse menu selections, they have asian food and italian! Food is always good. The service varies depending on who your server is that day. Sometimes the waiting time for a table is crazy. Parking is hit or miss.

Great restaurant. One of those places where you wish they had a better location or bigger building because it can get packed. Tucked in a small shopping strip, next to Snoh and across the street from Oregano's.   Food is totes delish. Service can be questionable: the nice waiters are super-nice, the not-so-nice waiters are tolerable.  Great menu. Asian food or Italian. Yum, yum, and yum!   Kid-friendly? Not so much. Small dining area. Kind of compact.   Decent prices. Needs a fresh remodeling, but no big deal.

Don't blink, cuz you'll miss them driving down 24th street. If you do happen to find the place and are able to squeeze into their "parking lot", then I think you'll be happy.  I have come here for the last 10 years. I don't think the place has changed much in the last 10 decades. Yes, that is a hundred years.  But, still keep coming back because they haven't screwed up anything of mine.  Yes, they do only speak spanish. I don't know what Rand is talking about, regarding them being Vietnamese. I guess I always work with the Spanish crew.  I have brought in a leather jacket and they altered it for less than $20. A place on Indian School wanted $80+ because it was real leather.  I have brought in slacks, button replacements, zipper fixes, belt loop repairs, and converted button up shirts to slim fits. Everything came out great, as directed. Pay on the average of $5 to $7. I find that the more I bring in, the less I pay per item.  For example, if I bring in a button replacement, I might $3. If I bring in a pair of slacks to taper the legs, than maybe it'll cost $7. But if I bring in both at the same time, I might end up paying $8 for everything.   My advice, take the extra minute or two to ensure they know what you want. After they put in the pins for the location of the sew, cut, etc., put the clothing back on for a double-check.  Also, learn a little spanish, or vietnamese. It'll go a long way.  Cash only, if I remember correctly!

The best place to experience comic book culture. It's crammed with books, comics, and toys. You have to explore every nook and cranny to see everything they have.   The owner "My name is Howard not Greg" is super friendly and funny. I'm not sure if this is true, but if he likes you and you're not a doosh, he'll sell you stuff less than cover price!  I was buying comics when cover prices were 50 cents, so discounts on these $4 comics is awesome.  Oh yeah, no one knows about this: Ask to see the HELLBOY mural in the bathroom!

Alright, oh dang, Da Vang! By far the best and most affordable Pho joint in town. I would say its authentic, but I've never been to Vietnam. Great food -- even more amazing is the cost!  Please understand though, its the real deal. The restaurant is in a dimly lit strip mall that's easy to miss. Look for the water dispensary in the parking lot. When you walk in you'll probably notice its older and surprise, surprise full of Vietnamese!  Don't expect the ambience of the Rice Paper Eatery. At Da Vang you'll be greeted by Vietnamese, not hipsters.   My recommendation: Beef Pho, fried rice, and spring rolls.

Great place for affordable dining. Now, just to clarify, the food is super good, but the ambiance is so so... and you are in Little Asiatown, too.  The wait staff is super nice. So, if you are looking for super good food and affordable prices than Dong-A. Still have to giggle at the name.  If you are looking to impress a date or friends from out of town, than Dong-A!!! No need to be shallow with your relationships right? IF you have to be pretentious for others than who are you really?

Great store for clothes and shoes... if you are a bargain shopper that doesn't mind scouring the racks. You may have to look for a while, they have a huge selection of clothes and shoes. Their accessories are totally lacking, if not cheap. Stay clear.   Definitely should be one of your "drop in" shops.

Great dog park! Well maintained. Used to be a dirt lot, but the citizens of Scottsdale took up the cause and the city takes better care of the place.  Always nice and friendly people/owners. My dog, a 10 pound Morkie, has never been attacked or mounted. Just to be clear, I also have never been attacked or mounted here as well.  Water fountains for the dogs, poopy bag dispensers, double-entrance gates, well-lit, adjacent to a baseball field, and a short walk nearby is a small botanical garden.  Great place. Great outdoor atmosphere. Open late also!

One star because I'm comparing it to the one in Scottsdale. This place is sketch-ee!!!  Dimly lit, so the only dog I'd bring here is a German Shepherd or Doberman... and that's to protect me! Since I have a tiny Morkie, I pack my 9mm instead.  Like most dog parks there's a big/active dog section and a little/passive section. Thanks for the signage City of Phoenix, too bad no one pays attention. Big dogs in the small dog section ALL THE TIME.  Usually what I end up doing is driving here (5 minutes away) to feel it out, and then 9 out of 10 times I make the 20 minute drive to Scottsdale.  One star awarded because it exists. That's about it. On a nice day it's worth walking around the area. There's a cool duck pond nearby. I'll rate that separately.

Went there recently for the first time. Went in to get mah hur dun and was connected with Linda. She did an amazing job. She was very personable and easy to talk with. Linda was fast but still detail oriented.   I love the Saturday hours. Very convenient.  Would I go back? Absolutely! Would I recommend to a friend? Yes, all of them!

Yumtastic!  Good food and dietary-restriction friendly. If you have any loved ones who can't have gluten, dairy, wheat, malt, or coffee than this place has a dish or two for them.  I'm not sure what it is, but this place is better than its Arcadia location.

Yup, if you need a plumber, Artie is your guy. Might be hard to book nowadays. His YELP profile has totally blown up!  When you call him expect him to be pretty busy. When he arrives be prepared for a heavy east coast accent and a mullet. Bonus: High-waisted pants and a belt.  Super nice, helpful and friendly. Plan your plumbing disasters accordingly.

Great place to see both national and local acts. Live music most nights. DJ's too.   When you walk up to the place you'll see the outdoor sitting area. When you first walk inside you'll be in the smaller stage area with tables, a full bar, and a TV or two.  Further in is where the larger stage is.  My friend plays here and her band gets paid decently. You have to appreciate a venue that pays musicians for their talent and the crowd they bring in. If you have ever been to NY or LA you know many venues have a "pay to play" system. Not cool.  Food is good and decently priced. Most beers on tap. Decent options for drinks and wine.  Great place to experience downtown Phoenix's music scene. Yes we have a music scene. It's just completed spread out across the metropolitan area we call home.

The best place for dietary restrictive date nights! If you don't have any dairy issues, you'll still love this place. Sooo good!   Good things take time, so be prepared for your yummy to take a bit of time. It's made when you order.

Comics, toys, & stuff you threw away and wish you had back. Ever wonder what happened when your mom threw your comics and toys away? These guys have them! We get 15% on our comic books here. Tons of Silver Age at higher grade, too. My favorite place to feel like I'm a kid again. I kinda feel like I could bump into one of the guys from Big Bang Theory at any moment! It's totally nostalgic!

One of the best contractors I've used for my home repairs. Clean, professional, and solid. Used the service for drain cleaning, and will use him again for a shower repair. Highly recommend!

The Stand is a nice change-of-pace burger / taco option for Phoenix downtowners and hipsters and those of us who aren't zombies. The Stand is awesome for folks with food allergies. I was in there and the owner was explaining his sensitivity towards people with food allergies because of his own personal (family) challenges.   5 stars for the customer service. 4.5 stars for the food. 4 stars for the prices.  It's a locally owned business, so I'll continue to support it!

More expensive than Petsmart or Walmart. They do have a few things that the two former stores do not carry.  Poor customer service. Employees are weird. Sometimes they talk to each other instead of the customer...while the customer is right in front of them at the cash register.   They now have an attached grooming service. I don't know. I have just about given up on this place. Would be surprised if they are still around in 6 months.

Professional and knowledgeable mobile motorcycle mechanic. I asked my wife to find a mobile mechanic and she found Anthem online. I contacted the owner/mechanic and he set up an appointment quickly. The work was done efficiently and the final bill was less than originally quoted. The owner, Jacob, took complete ownership of my '09 Ninja 650 and made sure it was road-worthy before he signed off on it. The prices are fair and he's a certified mechanic. Highly recommend using this company.

I took lessons with Chad Martin and he's by far the best drum teacher I've had (I've had two other instructors). He has a laid back teaching style, but he doesn't let you slack. Chad is personable and helpful, but at the same time pushes you to help achieve your goals.  I knew Chad because he was in a band project with friends of mine. He knows his stuff. He has toured all over and played with the best musicians in Phoenix. This guy has been around the Valley for a while, but he's still pretty bad-A! You know that one guy who thinks he's cool because he's in a band? That's not Chad. Chad is like the Chuck Norris of drummers. Chad doesn't play music, he is music.  He also teaches at the School of Rock, but I took private lessons because we both live in the Arcadia area. SOR is cool for kids, but not for working folk.   Like I said, he's super personable. Total family guy.
