Phoenix friends, if you haven't experienced Barrio Caf√© you done know what you are missing.  I anticipated a little taquerid was pleasantly surprised to find this to be do much more.  Guacamole made tableside was excellent, the seasonal Poblano chili dish was amazing. Service was excellent and we will definitely be returning.

Will NEVER be back.  Apparently rudeness is acceptable service.  My friend went in to pick up our pizza, watched the pizza jockey pull and stretch a pie trying to get it of the board and into the oven.  When the cashier was asked if that was our pizza, my friend was told "I'm not gonna tell you that" and refused to answer direct questions.  I guess they have enough business that they don't need my business now or in the future.

Great burgers, shakes are thick and tasty, wonderful proprietors.  It doesn't get any better than this.

Best burger find in a long while! Literally down the street from home, patty melt was delish and just found out they do breakfast all day!  This is gonna be a new favorite spot

Paid $20 and Waited over 20 min for 2 corned beef on rye sandwiches that were awful!  The meat looked like it came from a roll of baloney and it had 2 pieces of cheese.  The best part of the meal was the potato chips.  Never ever again!

Won't be back to this location.  Lines of what appeared to be open seats and, after being ignored by three girls at the hostess stand  (I was the only one at the counter) was told it would be a 1 1/2 hour wait.  Guess my money isn't green enough.
