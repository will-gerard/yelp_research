After scouring the various options before going out to Vegas, my fiancee and I decided to settle on Picasso after looking online at the menu. What is not necessarily apparent right off is that you have to request sitting outside on the patio if the weather is nice enough for it. You get a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains - but from the other side of the tourists - which give it an even better backdrop with the replica Eiffel Tower, the 'Paris' balloon, and the modernist Cosmopolitan/Aria buildings. I was shocked that the restaurant was pretty empty when we came for our 6:30 PM reservation on Friday evening (and it wasn't appreciably more crowded when we left)...but the setting is in a class by itself when you are outside. Maybe you don't appreciate having your conversations stopped every 15 minutes, but it was a fantastic setting for dinner. Our servers were prompt with service, pouring water and serving the dishes in a well-timed fashion.  One of my concerns when looking at the menu was that there weren't many options to choose from for dinner. I went with the prix fixe as a result, as I felt that afforded me more options (as my fiancee did the Degustation). Starting out with poached oysters was a great choice - it's four oysters, in the half-shell, presented with generous amounts of caviar and vermouth-infused broth. I'm not sure it's quite the equivalent of how Per Se treats oysters and caviar as a pairing, but it was so delicious - the sumptuousness of the oyster paired with the rich broth and the bursts of saltiness from the caviar - and the presentation in the half-shell was very unique. My fiancee's lobster salad was also very good. It's presented much more as a tartare with a light dash of flavoring, really allowing you to take in the deliciousness of the lobster, which tasted as fresh as if it had been caught that morning in the ocean. We both had delicious foie gras, albeit presented in different ways. The torchon was really well-done, presented with a toasted piece of brioche (although thinner than I would have thought) with caramalized pineapples and a dash of fruit (I want to say it was cherry) sauce. I really like the intensity of fruit with the torchon, so I wish there was more of the cherry, but the pineapples worked as a nice contrast to the richness of the foie as well. My fiancee's foie came out in seared fashion - it really does look like a steak, given how much is served - with an intense rhubard that really worked well with the bursts of juiciness that come with each bite. Her other appetizer (the scallops) were also delicious with regards to preparation. For the entree, we both went with red meats - I with the milk-fed veal chop, she with the lamb loin. Both were cooked to perfection; I really liked the veal served with au jus, which magnified the succulent flavors of the meat.  To be honest, I forget the desserts offhand (my memory ain't what it used to be, but they were both delicious), and the chocolate chip mini-muffins given as a bite for the next morning were so freakin' good. I'd come back here in a heartbeat - not only for the view, but the food here is really good. Given that I'm sure most of the food is sourced from somewhere other than Las Vegas (I can't imagine there are many farms in the desert), I can understand the relative consistency of the menu. But everything is so well-executed that I wouldn't mind coming back and having virtually the same meal again. For the price ($115-125, depending on which menu you eat), it is a relative bargain compared to some spots in NYC, and their cocktails and wine selection hold up to snuff as well. I would've been surprised ahead of time to hear that they have 2 Michelin Stars, but after eating here, I fully understand why.

I came here for breakfast, mainly because we had 2 complimentary buffet tickets as part of staying at New York New York, and MGM was just a bridge walk across the street. We arrived a little before 11 AM on Saturday morning and didn't have to wait all that long to get in - after getting through the first line (for the register) and the second line (waiting to get seated), we probably were all seated within 10 minutes. Since you serve yourself, there's not much to discuss in that arena, although the waitresses are very keen on refilling your champagne glasses without even asking if you want more...I would imagine it's quite easy to get yourself quite loaded before the morning is even out.  As for the food - most of it is standard brunch fare, but a great deal of it isn't all that fresh. The bacon was all over the map -  some pieces were too chewy, other pieces were overly crisp. Scrambled eggs were okay, if not terribly fluffy given how long they were sitting there. While I liked the flavor of the corned beef hash, it was way too dry. The tiny biscuits were good, but again - some were too dried out from sitting under hot lights for who knows how long. The spicy Polish sausage was probably the best thing I ate here, but that's not saying much - I've had better (and fresher) sausage elsewhere.  If you get your meal comped, you may as well show up. Otherwise, I'd probably stick with seeing what a traditional breakfast joint in Vegas would be like. If anything, it reminds me of why I haven't been at buffets in a long time (aside from encouraging me to stuff my face more than I should).

As part of some festivities a few weeks ago, a large group of us ended up at La Prunelle for dinner before going out. It was a large group of us (around 15 folks), but we had called in advance for a reservation and arrived right on time...so it was a bit of a surprise for us to end up standing around for 20 minutes waiting not only for the previous party (which was smaller) to finish their meal, but then for everything to get cleaned and properly put together for a large group. If anything, it's symbolic of why La Prunelle only gets a tad above one star - the service was poor, to describe it charitably. Perhaps it's because we were ugly Americans north of the border, but it definitely felt like we were being put up with than being served. The impressions certainly did not improve when we were told they were short on menus(!), so we had to share some...including some French-only(!!) versions. I pretty much had to interpret the menu based off the menu on their website that had some (but not all) of the dishes with English subtitles.  After a lengthy wait to finally place our order (another note: we had to wait way too long in between courses), we finally got our hands on some food to eat, which, for a large group, came off of a set menu. I went with the mushrooms with truffle oil to start; these were really good - cooked through just enough so they weren't soggy, and marinated with a richly truffle-infused sauce that really enhanced the earthy flavors of the mushrooms. I split a foie gras appetizer with a few others, and while it was solid, I've had better foie elsewhere. I went with the braised beef shoulder for the entree, and the preparation was great - not overly heavy despite the cut of meat, and very succulent and with a rich marinade making for a delicious bite of meat. The dash of thick pumpkin puree, though, was a misfire, with the flavor just not complementing the beef very well on its own. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate tart...which I never got. I'm not kidding; we had paid for dinner when the entrees come out, but they brought out dessert for only half of the table, and since we had to pick up and go, we didn't stick around to wait for the rest to eventually make its way to us. I had a bite of someone else's as I was standing up to go - decent flavoring, but a bit too light for my preferences.  On sheer service alone, this was one of the worst experiences I've had recently. I had definitely anticipated better, and I would only recommend coming here if you are with a small group of people and are planning to have a meal at a VERY relaxed pace. The food is alright for sure, but it's not something that I would take the chance of enduring the kind of service that was provided here again. Very surprising that on a Saturday night (ostensibly one of the more popular nights for folks to go out and eat), we had such a difficult and trying experience.

For our only night of dinner in Montreal, one of my friends called long in advance to reserve a table here, based on its fame for preparing duck (and foie gras in particular) really well. Funny, because she was the vegetarian in our party...with the reservation, getting seated was a cinch. The restaurant comes off as a lot more casual than one might think; it's about as loud as a bar is, and you have music playing in the background, adding to what comes off as a much more casual atmosphere. The menu is unfortunately a bit lacking in description (I think it's that way in French and English, so you're out of luck no matter what), which didn't help too much when we were trying to figure out what to order. Our service was pretty solid in bringing out our food and making sure our beer mugs were kept full.  As for the food itself, we started out with the tarragon bison tongue, which was really good. It's lightly cooked, but not overly done, giving it a texture that falls apart when you bite into it. The goodness of tarragon, mixed in with a cream sauce, really makes this a flavorful keeper as far as appetizers go. The onion soup is also really good here - it's got much more depth and flavor than most American versions of French onion soup have, and the cheese is present enough to give it flavor, but not dominate the dish when you take a bite. The maple-glazed fried chicken wings (which were a daily special) were also really good as far as wings go, but they're also incredibly sticky (you're provided a hot washcloth to wipe yourself off afterward). As for the main courses - well, we went all-out and had virtually a sampling of every meat dish there was. The house cut of pork was very succulent, although a big chunk of it was just fat and bone - which maybe explains why it weighed as much as it did. The terrine was phenomenally done here - one of the best I've had, and it worked really well with the apricot jam that was served alongside of it. The guinea hen (and yes, it's a full hen, complete with feet!) was pretty much what I'd expect from a chicken dish, although I did like the mashed potatoes combined with the gravy/broth that was left in the bottom of the pot. The duck magret was not terribly memorable (I would pass), while the duck in a can was very good. In particular, the foie has a texture that is somewhere between the kind that just melts as soon as you take a bite, and terrine. It works to add a substantive fattiness to the duck meat. Although we were absolutely stuffed at the end, we had to go for dessert, and I'm glad we did. The milkshake is not heavy at all, and it's got a nice hint of maple that really makes it a sweetly perfect way to finish off dinner. The ganache is also really good - with a bunch of crunchy nuts on top - but it's hard to beat the milkshake.  In all, we had a really solid dinner here. I wouldn't say it's necessarily the best of any of the meats I've ever had, but they do a really solid job with it. The food's a bit on the heavy side, and the portions are not small - so plan appropriately when ordering! I'd love to come back and try some of the other foie dishes, just to taste how many different ways it can be utilized.

My friend and I swung by Phillip's for a quick bite while our plane made a stop in Charlotte (our gate was right next to the restaurant). It's pretty simple - sit down, place your order when a waiter comes around, and get your food pretty quickly. The only real complaint is that the food's a bit expensive (as all airport food is) and that they didn't have BBQ sauce when I requested it for the chicken tenders. Aside from that, the food was pretty much what'd you expect overall from this kind of joint. The tenders were pretty standard, served with honey mustard sauce. The seafood platter comes with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. I felt better for not getting the bigger crab cakes when I had theirs - the crab meat was extremely nondescript, coated in fried breadcrumbs but with an indistinguishable taste aside from that. The spring rolls were okay, if unspectacular, and the fried shrimp was decent.  You're not going to get much service here - our waiter had to be flagged to give us our check - but it's an airport spot, so you can't really set expectations too high. I'd probably stop by if I wanted something other than standard fast food in the airport, but there's not much any other reason to come by here.

After a hearty late evening of drinking at Le Lab, my friends and I wandered over to La Banquise, which we had walked by earlier and had known was where there was some good poutine being served. Even at 3 AM, there was a pretty solid line out the door to get in - which gives you an idea of how much the inhabitants of Montreal either like their poutine or like La Banquise. We were probably in line for around 20-25 minutes before we got seated, but after that, it's very much a speedy journey until you get your poutine, as the servers are running around frenetically trying to serve and move people out as quickly as they can. You pay for your bill before the food arrives (in case you should be too inebriated to remember to pay), and the food comes out quickly - which, for this kind of joint, you can't ask really any more of.  As for the poutine itself, I've only had it once before in Toronto, but this was definitely better stuff. You really can choose from a whole bunch of different kinds; in the end, we got one of the vegetarian ones (I believe it was the with guacamole and sour cream), as two with meat (La Jaco and one of the others with spicy sausage in it). The meat ones were really all about the savory greasiness of meat mixed in with french fries and cheese curd, which adds an interesting texture (if a taste that I'm not terribly good at recalling) to the dish. La Jaco really does a good job with the mushroom goodness, which adds a nice distinct flavor and depth to the greasy sauce that you'll be dipping your bites in. I really liked the vegetarian one, though - it's extremely fatty, but I don't think there's another occasion I'd take to eat sour cream. It pretty much tastes like a taco without the meat, but it's really hearty nonetheless.  You can pretty much show up here anytime, as I think it's a 24-hour restaurant, but if you walk by in the evening, you'll definitely see how popular it is. Don't expect incredible service or even necessarily great quarters (we sat at a table that fit 4 but ended up having all 6 of us), but you're here to get your grub on. Probably a must-see if you're insistent on trying some truly local cuisine...and you can take out if you really don't feel like waiting.

On our last day in Montreal, a group of friends and I did a bike tour around the city with Fitz & Folwell. We had to reserve a few weeks in advance, and our preferred date (Saturday) was fully booked - so definitely call ahead if you have interest. The tour starts at 10 and is advertised to end at 2 - but be aware that if you do have slow riders in your group (and we had a couple who crashed a few times, which slowed down our tail rider), it will go longer. Our bike tour ended at 3:45 PM, which was substantially later than we anticipated - but the weather was incredibly gorgeous out (70 degrees with nary a cloud in the sky), so I did not mind at all.  If you show up around 15 minutes ahead of time, it's easy enough to get set up - you head out back (which is really just walking through the back of the store to a back road, where it's easy to get people set up on their bikes). After a short introduction (we had Frederic as our guide, and Mimi, a McGill student, as our tail rider), we were on our way. There's much more of a balance at the beginning of talking about the sites are you ride through McGill through downtown, and eventually down through Old Montreal to the water; once you bike past Old Port (which you will stop by later on), you get a decent amount of stretch where you are just biking beside Lachine Canal to Atwater Market. There, you'll eat lunch (which, for us, was pizza...and they even bought me a beer, which was quite awesome) on the old, unused tracks that ran along the canal before heading back. As mentioned previously, you'll stop by Old Port before heading up through the Latin Quarter and Plateau Mont-Royal back to the shop. It's a very informative tour that mixes in the sites of more modern Montreal with its older past. Frederic was very charming and knowledgeable about the sites, and didn't talk for too long - which can be a drawback of informative tours at times. The way the tour is designed, such that it does allow for an extended stretch of pure biking, was a nice way to make it feel more like you're just out for a bike ride and not stopping all the time.  In all, this was a phenomenal experience. If you are looking for a tour that will give you a great overview of the main areas of Montreal, this is a must-do. The shopowners are incredibly friendly, and it's right by Mont-Royal as well - so it's centrally located. Even if you haven't biked for a long time (and this was my first time in nearly 10 years), you won't feel like you're in danger, mainly because Montreal drivers have a sense of courtesy that some (like those in my native New York City) lack.

After stuffing ourselves at Au Pied de Cochon, our group made our way towards Candi Bar, mainly on the strength that we were interested in trying out drinks that apparently tasted like candy. Although there was a bouncer there by 11 PM, we were able to get in without much trouble (and perhaps because we had the right gender balance, if Montreal cares about that kind of things). It was also perfect timing, because the tables were all occupied at that time, and it definitely started getting more crowded at that point in time (the tables are also all reserved after midnight). I'm a huge fan of the decor - the artwork is very unique but also really well-done; the lights are kept low, and the low ceilings give it a very intimate feeling. The music is also very solid - from what I recall, mostly American music that's probably from the last decade.  That said, the main theme of the club was disappointing. The gummy bear drink had virtually no alcohol in it and was more liable to give you massive brain freeze if you drank out of the straw too quickly. The ladies at the table had another drink (the name of which I forget) that had the same Gatorade blue color and had slightly more alcohol in it. For the price (which I think came out to around $12/drink), it's simply way too expensive for something that is marginally alcoholic, at best. Even as a sugary pop drink, it's not that good.  In short - great concept, nice atmosphere, but really crummy drinks. If you want to come here just to chill, you'll have a good time, but I'd recommend a real cocktail if they make any, or beer, if you're looking for a beverage at this spot.

There's not much to say about Blizz, except that they offer what they say they offer (froyo and smoothies), albeit it at a bit of a higher price than I'm used to. I ended up going with the acai berry smoothie, which was pretty much what I expected, albeit a bit steep at an $8 starting price (and nearly an additional $1 for any boosters). It was okay, if a little bit on the bland side, and the protein powder seemed pretty weak relative to other smoothies I've had that usually have that boost.  The service was fine and quick, but if you are looking for something new or unique, Blizz is just your generic (albeit overpriced) smoothie and yogurt joint. There has to be a Pinkberry (or something similar) somewhere else on the Strip that would be better.

My Westin experiences in the past have been a bit mixed, and when we pulled up to the somewhat dated-looking valet parking spot, I wasn't sure how things would turn out. Step inside, though, and you have a very nice fire pit right outside the entrance, with a very modern, cosmopolitan feel to the hotel lobby. The walk to the elevator was a bit on the longer side, but not a huge deal. The room is the real treat, though - fantastic cityscape views of Phoenix, with the mountains in the background, and a feeling of having a huge room because the ceilings are so high here! We had a standard room with one king bed, and it felt so much bigger because of the floor-to-ceiling windows. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom had the same touches as other Westins I've been to but felt a bit more put-together. I really like the showerheads that are affixed to the ceiling and drop straight down, and the showers here had that.  The folks at the desk were nice, although I'm not sure they are fully attentive. They did not email me my receipt for the stay (not a big deal), and they also didn't even bother charging me for the overnight valet parking. Overall, a fabulous choice at a pretty decent price (probably because it was a couple days before Thanksgiving, with no events going on), and one that I would recommend if you're just passing through town or staying in Phoenix for a while.

Although we had a bit of trouble finding Le Lab (thanks to none of us having international phone plans, a cabbie who apparently was unfamiliar with Montreal's geography, despite telling us everything about where the gangs are; and the address being listed as 351 on some websites), we finally made it with a couple hours to spare before closing time. It's a dimly lit area that makes it feel like a speakeasy, but with pop music blaring and a much louder vibe than you'd find at a quiet bar. We sat at a table that could fit our party that was closer to the entrance, and our waitress was good about coming over and taking our (rather frequent) drinks orders and being a good sport about it despite us being English speakers.  As for the drinks themselves, they're definitely a bit on the pricey side (everything seemed to be in the $12-15 range, which is basically NYC prices), but they were pretty good overall. The Jerky Lab Jack is pretty much a must-try, as it's a house specialty. I'm not a huge fan of whiskey on the rocks (which is pretty much what this looks like), but it turned out quite well - the BBQ bitters add a hint of spiced flavor that Jack on its own doesn't have, and the beef jerky itself (which is good - well-flavored, and not too chewy, with the right amount of toughness) helps to temper the edge on the drink. Jay's Basilic also turns out quite well; the basil serves more to provide an herbal whiff as you sip on the drink, which is heavily based on the raspberry but delicious without being overly fruity. The Tiger Thai Collins is also really good - the chili adds a dash of spice, but aside from that, it has a very bubbly and refreshing taste to it.  In all, the drinks here are all pretty well-done. I do also like that there is a small beer selection, in case you'd like to switch it up. This is a very chilled-out bar and a great place to sample interesting drinks and have a great time. It's not a dance bar, so don't come here expecting to rock your moves out; it's pretty much a speakeasy but at regular bar volumes.

One of my friends was a fan of Evil Dead, so after a day of gambling, sightseeing around Vegas and Red Rock Canyon, and a solid steak dinner, we made our way on a whim over to Evil Dead. I guess it's probably a bad sign when you show up on a Saturday night and the show hasn't started yet, even though you're 15 minutes late. The second bad sign? Coming in and seeing a theater that was more than half-empty. In all, the entire production felt extremely amateur - like something you'd see put on by a high school theater at best. Drinks here are stupidly priced (a Dos Equis set me back $10), and our waitress spilled our drinks in the middle of a scene.  We ended up heading out during the first intermission. Both of us had fallen asleep at some point during the show, and there was absolutely nothing that inspired us to stay further. Given the cost of tickets here, I'd recommend going elsewhere for evening entertainment.

On our way up to Sedona for the holiday weekend, my wife and I did a quick pit stop at Zookz as we were driving out of town. We got there pretty early - around 10 AM - so the restaurant was pretty empty, and Carole (the owner) was working the register herself. She's very friendly, and she brought out our sandwiches once they were done. The interior itself is pretty much what you would expect for a fast-casual spot, but you can also read the story of how Zookz came to be on the wall next to the television - a very interesting and cool background!  As for the sandwiches - it's really well-done, particularly the crisp on the outside of the bread, and it definitely fills you up...you can fit a lot of stuff into those pockets! I ended up going with one of their breakfast sandwiches that had typical breakfast foods (egg, bacon, avocado) and topped off with some sriracha-infused sour cream (I think) that made it a properly fusion breakfast sandwich. My wife went with No. 25 - more of a lunch offering perhaps, but it also has black beans, avocado, and definitely more of a Mexican bent. The ham in particularly was quite juicy, providing a nice contrast to the crunch and crisp of the bread. We got a small side salad (corns and black beans being the base), which was pretty much in-line with the Mexican-inspired theme that the breakfast sandwiches take.  Overall - a really delicious meal at great prices. You'll definitely come away from here filled, and I really do wish there were more stores selling jaffles (which seems to be the name used in most other ex-British colonies, according to trusty Internet research). Although the sandwich may be unique, the fillings fit right in, and it's hard to go wrong with any of the choices offered. If I'm back in Phoenix anytime soon, I'll definitely be swinging by here for a meal!
