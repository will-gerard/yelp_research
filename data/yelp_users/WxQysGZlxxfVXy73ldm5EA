I went to My Mother's for dinner with a large group of family members (16), including 6 kids ranging in age from newborn to 8 years old. While the decor was generically bad "down-home" from the 80's, the staff was very nice and seated us in a side room with plenty of space for all of us.  The meal started with homemade bread which was warm and soft. This gave me hope that the meal wouldn't be in keeping with the general feel of the place. Alas, my hope was not long lived and I soon felt like an Obama supporter watching McCain win the election.  After ordering, I made my way to the salad bar. This seemed quaint, considering that salad bars aren't really popular anymore, unless you're at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes. The salad bar was not entirely scary, but wasn't anything worth going back to. I'm fairly certain everything came out of a can, bag, bottle or box. The freshest thing may have been the red onion, which obviously had been poorly sliced by hand.  Moving on to the main course, I had Mother's Meat Loaf dinner. My meat loaf came with rice pilaf and green beans. Once again, food from cans and boxes made an appearance, as my beans were canned and my rice must have come from a box mix. The meatloaf was actually made from non-canned meat, but wasn't all that exciting. It had been cooked with ketchup slathered on top, yet was served with gravy on the side (probably originally made from a powder mix). I ate most of my dinner because I was hungry, not because of the quality.  Hoping for a come-from-behind win in a big electoral state, I ordered pie for dessert. They tout their homemade pies, but seem to think that "homemade" means making pie from canned ingredients. My cherry pie was not spectacular, as the preprocessed cherry filling was encased in crust which attempted to be light, flaky and buttery, but only managed to be dry and chewy.  My Mother's was saved from a one-star rating by two things...the graciousness and patience of the staff, and the low prices. For two dinners and a huge slice of pie split between my wife and I, our total bill including tax and tip was $35.  My advice is to keep your hope in homestyle cooking and stay out of My Mother's Restaurant.

It's official...I'm in love with FEZ. I've never had a bad experience here. I've been to FEZ with small groups and larger ones and never had bad service. Most recently, I was there with for brunch with Smunch (http://smunchphoenix.com or http://twitter.com/smunchphoenix), which wound up being a group of over 30 people for Saturday brunch. Thomas and his staff never missed a beat, especially our server, who gracefully handled a constant stream of orders and meal deliveries as people arrived at different times.  The food at FEZ is divine. The sweet potato fries are ridiculously good, as is the FEZ benedict and peach bellini for brunch. The benedict is a wonderful twist on the classic, served on French bread with oven-dried tomatoes.  On top of the great food and service, I love the ambiance and location of FEZ. As Dave B. said, the interior is totally metrosexual, in a good way. It has all of the upscale urban vibe that Phoenix needs more of, and the location on Central Avenue is perfect. Parking is not a problem and it's only a couple minutes walk from two light rail stations if you want to leave the car elsewhere.  The bottom line is that FEZ is great place whose attention to quality and urban ambiance makes it one of the best dining destinations along the Central Corridor.

Joe's Farm Grill is a jewel on the southeast side of the Valley. From the retro 60's farm decor to the reuse of the old farm buildings to the top-notch food, Joe's is worth a trip from any part of town.  My wife and I had been to Liberty Market, one of Joe Johnston's other restaurants and we wanted to try Joe's Farm Grill. After a trip to Schnepf Farms, we decided it was a good opportunity to try Joe's for lunch.  I had a Fontina burger with fries and I was highly impressed. The burger itself was juicy and flavorful, without being greasy. The meat itself is lightly season with a mixture of herbs and spices, probably including salt, pepper and thyme, but I don't know for sure. Regardless, it made for a great patty. The mushrooms, red pepper, and arugula on the burger were fresh and yummy. I would have gone a little lighter on the pesto spread, but it was good, so I won't nitpick too much.  The fries were done just right, cut to a good size with the skin on and fried to perfection...crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My wife had garlic fries with her meal and claimed they were the best garlic fries she's ever had. I tried some and I'm inclined to agree. The garlic seasoning mixture was done very well and wasn't loaded too heavily on the fries, nor was it too skimpy.  I look forward to returning to Joe's for many meals in the future, especially for a breakfast.

My wife and I were having a lousy day and we needed somewhere to eat. We happened to drive past Stax and decided to give it a try. Once we sat down, our moods immediately improved. Our waiter was friendly, funny and attentive, without being overbearing or annoying. I was happy to see a decent selection of beers with a healthy dose of local brews. I immediately ordered an Oak Creek Nut Brown.  Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and glasses of water with cucumber slices. The cucumber added a nice cooling touch on a hot summer day.  We ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered a seafood burger, which on that particular day was shrimp. The sweet potato fries were excellent, fried just right and lightly seasoned with kosher salt. Even without the homemade ketchup, the fries were a delight.  My burger was tasty, with the shrimp lightly breaded and seasoned with a kicky teriyaki sauce and served on the bun with lettuce and thin strips of carrots. Also, the bun was very soft and tasty.  The only issue with Stax is the price. The burgers are more like tapas, in that they're small (3 oz). But, each burger ranges from $4 to $7, depending on the type of meat. A hungry person could easily eat three burgers, so plan to spend a decent amount of money if you want a large meal here.  Overall, a fun place to grab a lighter bite to eat.

First of all, let me state that I completely love Cartel. There's only two reasons that keep me from giving them 5 stars: the difficult to find location and the crappy wifi. Honestly, if the wifi rocked, that would probably be enough for me.  I call Cartel the "accidental coffeehouse". It started off as a roasting operation with a small espresso/retail component. Thanks to the ridiculously high quality of their coffee, they grew into a full-fledged coffeehouse.  The coffee Cartel roasts and brews is consistently some of the best in the valley. I am in love with their Black Market Espresso, which is a favorite of mine both at the shop and in the office when I brew my own.  Cartel provides all of the standard espresso beverages as well as iced toddy. However, they don't do any of the foofy blended drinks. Not only do I appreciate their commitment to classic coffee drinks, I also enjoy the freedom from hearing an insanely loud blender when I'm attempting to have a conversation.  There's also a couple of less common brewing methods available at Cartel. They have pour-over brewers which brew single cups. This enables them to offer any of their beans as fresh brewed coffee. Also, they have a Clover machine, which brews single cups on demand.  I do wish that Cartel served some pastries or other food, but Cartel is unabashedly committed to coffee, so I can't fault them for this.  The vibe at Cartel is a great mix of bohemian eclectic, which fits their proximity to ASU's main campus. The largely windowless interior makes it a great place to take refuge from the often brutal Arizona sun and enjoy a drink or two while hanging out with friends or getting work done.  Overall, Cartel is an excellent addition to the Phoenix coffee scene.

Solo Cafe is definitely one of the premier coffeehouses in the Phoenix area. They make excellent coffee drinks from Ron Cortez-roasted beans and all of their tea and pastries are from local businesses as well.  The ambiance at Solo can best be described as upscale eclectic. It definitely isn't pretentious, but it isn't the typical bohemian coffeehouse feel. The owners of Solo just completed a minor facelift of the shop, changing out some of the art and rearranging the interior. On the back wall, they added a large mural which features the Solo Cafe name. Also, they're in the process of adding a kitchen so that they can offer a wider selection of food, which I think will serve to make this awesome coffeehouse even better.  Solo Cafe is a gem among the Phoenix coffee scene and it's great to see a local business thriving.

Sweet Republic makes the best ice cream in America, as far as I'm concerned. I've been to the place several times and I have never had anything which was less than amazing. Everything is made in the store, from ice cream to sorbet to cookies and waffle cones.  Both of the owners are wonderful people who clearly have a passion for making and sharing great ice cream. They also use as many local ingredients as possible. Recently, I've enjoyed Peaches & Cream ice cream made with fresh peaches from a local farm.  Also, Sweet Republic as come up with some flavors which one wouldn't think to put into ice cream, but at this place, different is magic. Jalapeno Avocado, Bacon and Guinness are all flavors I've had here.  But, Sweet Republic also brings the magic to common flavors and does them brilliantly. Their Belgian Chocolate is to die for if you're a chocolate lover and their Mocha sorbet is fantastic. Finally, the pinnacle of Sweet Republic's flavors is the Salted Butter Caramel. A true description of the taste of this ice cream is really impossible, but it is wonderful.

This past weekend, I finally had a chance to try the brunch at Postino on Central. I went as part of Smunch, my monthly brunch meetup. I was really looking forward to this, as the reviews I'd read were glowing, and Postino did not disappoint!  I started brunch with a delightful peach bellini, and my wife and I shared an order of walnut toast with brie and fresh berry compote. The berries and brie were a fantastic combination and the bread was yummy, toasted lightly to add a bit of crunch.  I had the French toast, which I'd heard from Georgie S. was good enough to bathe in. It lived up to its reputation, as it was warm and soft inside without being too well done on the outside. It was served with creme fraiche, berry compote and sliced strawberries. It was an altogether delightful take on a breakfast classic.  Finally, I finished the morning with a glass of honey cucumber lemonade and a cup of coffee. The lemonade was absolutely wonderful, light and refreshing. I'm sure it's magic during the hot summer months, but even with the winter weather I found it enjoyable. The coffee is from Lola Coffee a local coffeehouse and roaster. It was slightly more bitter than I prefer, but I accept that I'm an unrepentant coffee snob, so I rate it as perfectly acceptable for a restaurant setting.  Finally, I have to commend Postino for handling the 30+ Smunch attendees very well. Troy (the manager) had set up four tables, but the group quickly expanded to seven. The staff, especially our excellent server Jenny handled everything with grace and a smile. I was also impressed that the kitchen staff was able to turn out so many simultaneous orders while keeping the quality high.  The only problem was with figuring out the bill. Instead of doing separate checks or checks per table, we had three or four checks which each contained the orders for several people, but we weren't sure whose was whose. In the end, we got it handled, and since this was a special situation, I didn't feel that it should take away from the five stars I feel Postino deserves.  Overall, Postino brunch is a resounding success!

Levi the locksmith lived up to the glowing reviews left by other on Yelp. I initially found him on Yelp and contacted him on account of his 5 star average. He was very responsive when I left him an initial voicemail and he returned my call on the same day to set up an appointment for the following Monday.  The following day, Levi realized that his schedule was too full and that he would need to reschedule. He was very prompt in letting me know and apologized for the need to reschedule. I appreciated that instead of trying to fit my house in to his schedule and doing substandard work, he moved my job to the next day.  When the appointment time did arrive, Levi was on time and did a fantastic job. His services are reasonably priced and well deserving of a 5 star review.

I've been to Gallo Blanco twice and had great experiences both times. The first time was for dinner and I tried the elote and tacos. The elote callejero was fantastic and a departure from usual Mexican fare. I loved the cojita cheese on it. The tacos are not the standard large tacos, but are smaller and are more like street tacos. They're also very reasonably priced, so two or three can make for a great main course.  The second time I ate at Gallo Blanco was for brunch with a large group (20+ people) and the food and service was excellent once again. Our server was very patient and accommodating, splitting checks in various ways and dealing with late arrivals. The food was also great; I had huevos rancheros with over-medium eggs and I was pleased. The eggs were cooked just right and I loved the thicker tortillas. Combined with a flavorful chili sauce, the huevos rancheros made for a great start to my day.  Finally, I'm really thrilled with Gallo Blanco's focus on using local vendors, especially Cartel Coffee Lab's coffee. I'm a big fan of Cartel, and I'm happy that I can get a great cup of coffee with my breakfast.

I noticed Margie's had opened in the strip mall along Broadway and I'm a big fan of indie coffeehouses in the Valley,  so I thought I'd check it out. Unfortunately, Margie's isn't even in the same league as the other nearby coffeehouses in Tempe.  Margie's doesn't really have a distinct personality. It's just a standard strip mall store, with the typical wooden coffeehouse chairs and generic art. It's uncluttered, but it feels like someone just bought some furniture at Costco or a restaurant supply store.  With regards to the coffee, my opinion is "Meh". They have a no-skill-required push-button espresso machine, which immediately turns me off. If I want espresso that requires no skill to make, I can go to Starbucks. I ordered a double espresso and it met my low expectations. It really didn't have much flavor, other than a lot of bitterness.  The whole feel of Margie's gives me the impression that the owners aren't really into running a coffeehouse, but seemed to think that the coffee/pastries/breakfast sandwiches business was an easy thing to get into and be successful. Overall, I think that they're competing directly with Starbucks, but giving customers no reason to go out of their way to come here. Margie's is trying to do what Starbucks does, but not doing it anywhere near as well, and they're certainly not coming close to offering the same quality and experience as the excellent indie coffeehouses around Tempe.  The hours are 5:30am to 2:30pm, which are clearly targeting the morning commuters and lunchtime crowd. While the prices may be a little lower than Starbucks, I'm not really sure Margie's is worth going out of the way for, especially with several Starbucks in the area. For myself, I'll stick with the far superior coffeehouses nearby.

In the Phoenix hailstorm of 2010, the large window in the master bedroom of my house was shattered. Thanks to Yelp, I found Garcia's Windows & More. I was impressed by their 5 star rating, which beat out every other competitor I found. I called Mark Garcia and he was able to give me an estimate within a couple days.  The service and the quality of work I received from Mark and his staff was worthy of the 5 star rating. Mark did an excellent job replacing my broken window and several screens which were also damaged in the storm.  Not only would I highly recommend Garcia's Windows & More to others, I've recently called upon them again to replace a broken kitchen window and screen. I wouldn't dream of calling anyone else to do glass work in my house.
