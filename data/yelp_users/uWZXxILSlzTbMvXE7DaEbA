Won't come back here... These people are incompetent... Over two weeks for alterations that still haven't been done.. Made me wait Despite coming before a regular.... I'll give one star because at least the lady was nice

So I've been ordering from these guys a few times a month because we enjoyed their food.... Normally through Grub Hub I've been having it delivered... This time I went to pick it up and turned out they didn't have a clue what happened to the order... I left because I didn't want to wait while they start the entire order again.... My wife called to follow up with their mistake and even asked to have it delivered instead but it comes to show when it comes to customer service they rank on the bottom... Having no leadership in the establishment really shows... The girl that answered didn't even differ to a manager ... Don't need to go on... They lost a regular also considering we tip well when they deliver it.........  So I put a 2 star for their review and the actual owner called my house and offered a few things...  It really didn't matter what they would of gave us but it's the principle that they called back and at least tried to accommodate their patrons.    Looks like we are ordering from them in about another ten days.   5 stars!!

After writing a great review for these guys after a huge mess-up a few months back.. I'm done with these guys...  Ordered food online.. food got here 2 hours later...  when I called them and asked the girl she claimed the fax was broken... then said GRUB HUB should of called me to inform me that it was running late???  Really?   The best part is when the food arrived THE DELIVERY GIRL SAID I HAVE TO PAY CASH!!  WTF?  I showed her my receipt when I ordered it and the payment.. even showed my BOA account the funds being withdrawn..  I would say these people got to get it together but I'm done with these guys.  Sad I was ordering pretty often and always giving them over 15% tip....lost a good consistent patron

Ordered some food.. the alfredo chicken was terrible.  I had to dump my entire chili flakes for the flavor... when they cooked the brocolli they dragged the excess water in the pasta dish...  or it was frozen and melted with the cooking process... either way that particular dish tasted bland ...  I've worked in the service industry for over 20 years.....  and can tell what's freshly made.  The delivery was cool.. tipped him fat but maybe I'll try and get something else if I order from here again.
