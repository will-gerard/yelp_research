We discovered Princess Mediterranean via Groupon, and became devoted fans from our first dinner experience. PM is a combo restaurant-grocery, and there is plenty for everyone to go around.  First, the restaurant. Bring a friend or two and on your first visit try the Princess Combo, which could easily satisfy three hungry diners. It comes with delicious chicken kabab, beef kabab, kofta kabab, chicken shawarma, and beef shawarma -- all of which you can order off the menu, as well. The toughest part is selecting your sides. The Arabic salad is my favorite, but the hummus and other options are delicious too. The service is super-friendly and if you go more than once, you're likely to be remembered. If there is any room for improvement, the iced tea (another addiction of ours) could use a little work -- but the food is so incredibly delicious (emphasis on INCREDIBLE!), it's a minor afterthought.  As for the grocery, there are countless treats to be found here, from spices to candies to foodstuffs guaranteed to make your mouth water. However, before you go pay your bill at the register, a MUST-DO is the baklava and namura (coconut cake) counter in the back. It's just about the very best I've ever, ever tasted -- and these sweet treats alone might keep you coming back again and again and again.  If Yelp allowed a 6-star rating, PM would get it from me. Go. Go now. You deserve it!

We discovered Mokis on groupon and loved it! The food is simply delicious, the staff is friendly, and the upbeat experience is fun. The first Friday of each month the host a luau night from 6pm to 8pm, which includes a scrumptious buffet and last night had really fun Haka dancers. Highly recommend!!

This is our favorite, at least once a month, Pho restaurant. The staff are courteous, friendly and efficient, and the food is excellent. As far as the Pho goes, there isn't a bad option on the menu, but the real treats are the other treasures on the menu, such as the salt & pepper calamari, which is the best I've ever had. The restaurant is large, that's a good thing because it gets pretty busy at peak times, though I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. Dinner for two, without drinks, may run you $20-25 + tip, but that's including appetizers (hint: the spring rolls are fresh and delicious), but your taste buds will thank you with every bite.

Yangtse Chinese Bistro is one of the East Valley's hidden gems. We come here for lunch and dinner and have always left satisfied and impressed. This is comfortable, friendly Chinese food served by friendly people in an atmosphere that is relaxing if not fancy. Considering lunch specials run an average of $5 plus drinks for tremendous food of prodigious portion size, you might feel just a little guilty getting so much for so little. But what they deliver is wonderful. Occasionally I dare to try something new, but more often than not, I stick with my far-and-above favorite, the Kung Pao Chicken with Peanuts lunch special (also offered as a dinner special with extra treats). This spicy, tasty treat will open your sinuses and wow your taste buds. This is one of those rare restaurants where you can't help but enjoy your meal, make friends with the people who work there, and start thinking about when you'll come back while you're paying your tab. They would be successful if they doubled their prices, but I'm thrilled they haven't. A must-try for the east valley!

Let's begin with arrival. There's a homeless person working the greeting station. Ok, maybe she's only dressed like a homeless person. This tyedyed greeter will eventually look up from whatever she's doing, stop chewing her gum long enough to seat you, then go back to (not kidding) walking around the restaurant with menus on her head.  So, then, you've been seated. It turns out the wait staff is very nice and very professional. A+ here.  We tried the PF Chang combo for two. The egg drop soup was fantastic. Someone apparently dropped an entire bag of salt in the hot n sour soup. I'd avoid that. And the dynamite shrimp appetizer was dy-no-mite! Very yummy.  We should have stopped here. The clumsy guy with the salt was back again. My Singapore street noodles had to have enough salt to de-ice the roads in upstate New York for a full winter. Couldn't finish it. By comparison, the Mongolian Beef was less salty, but it's possible a bag of salt might be less salty.  I'd write more but I'm gonna watch the hostess put on makeup at the front counter now. *sigh*

Far and away South Chandler's best sushi and tempura, and their miso soup is wonderful too. The staff is very friendly and by your second or third visit, you'll feel like you were missed on the days you didn't come in for lunch. Speaking of which, the lunch special combinations (sushi and tempura, for instance) are not only a great value, but are amazingly fresh and tasty, with the sushi prepared while you wait (never in advance). They have an extensive menu for specialty rolls, too, and if there is a better sushi option in the east valley, we haven't found it. Can't recommend highly enough!

Family-owned, friendly, fast and great for takeout or delivery. We order-in from Asian Grill at least once a month, if not more, but have never actually dined at the restaurant, though the tables are often crowded, so our reliance on this great Chandler/Sun Lakes fave for takeout shouldn't stop you from dining in.  The very first time I walked in the restaurant to pick up a menu, a woman waiting in line for her pickup order went out of her way to tell me, "You have to try the hot-and-sour soup; it's the best ever!" That's pretty high praise, as I've eaten in Chinatown in both LA and New York. Turns out, her recommendation was spot-on, which explains why Asian Grill is selling it's amazing soup all year around... even in Arizona during the summer.  Our typical order includes the soup or the equally impressive tempura shrimp apetizer, which are huge (and soooo tasty), the cashew chicken dinner, and the House Special Lo Mein, which includes beef, shrimp and vegetables with wonderful noodles.  We live close, so we often pick up, but their delivery service is free and quick, too. Can't recommend them enough.

Downtown Chandler has one breakfast spot that surpasses all of its competition: BRUNCHIES! The omelets are huge, the potatos are crisp and delicious, and the biscuits and gravy are, truly, legendary and must be seen to be believed (really, you'll go wide-eyed when you see their biscuits).  I was not surprised to learn that Brunchies was owned by the Serrano family, which operates another favorite of mine, SERRANO'S, an amazing Mexican restaurant just down the street. I think I read somewhere that the Serrano family business is one of the oldest continually-operating small businesses in Chandler, dating back to around 1919 or so. I will attribute their longevity and success to the quality of the food in their restaurants, and the dining experience they give their customers.  HINT: especially on weekends, the wait at Brunchies can be pretty long, but you can call-in and get your name added to the list before you arrive -- and thereby cut down on your wait-time once you get to the restaurant... but a big caveat there, don't call so early that you miss when you're name is called!

The Poisoned Pen would be a gem even if there were bookstores on every corner. In addition to having their own press with some really wonderful writers, and in addition to having a full wall of signed first editions to browse & buy (wow!), and in addition to hosting more author signing events than I've ever seen before, what really separates them (for me) from any/every other bookstore I've ever visited is the staff and owners who treat customers almost like family. It was fun to be a first-time visitor to the Poisoned Pen, and even more fun to return again. And again. And again. They are what all bookstores should aspire to be. THANK YOU POISONED PEN!

Haji-Baba was recently profiled on the television show "CHECK PLEASE ARIZONA" and after the great reviews they got on the tv, we had to try it. This was our BEST "check please" experience to date!  THE FOOD: make plans to go more than once, because even with the combination plates, you'll want to go back again and again until you've tasted it all! Yes, yes, the Chicken Shawerma is ah-may-zing! And yes, the portion sizes are very big (most folks leave with to-go boxes, but it's also hard not to over-order with such tasty offerings all over the menu). But the combination plates, in my opinion, are the way to go. It's not just a little bit of this and that... it's a full serving of this and that, and everything is so delicious, you'll be amazed with every bit. From the warm, delicious stuffed grape leaves to the hummous to the kebabs to, well, everything!  THE DRINKS: I have to mention this briefly... I'm an iced tea fan and the tea here is wonderful. They are always so busy, I haven't slowed someone down to ask what the slightly sweet flavor is, but it's the tea itself, not a sweetener. Yum!  THE SHOP: the building is 2/3 restaurant, 1/3 store... don't forget to pick up some truly fantastic baklava and/or turkish delight at the back counter register when you pay after your meal... it may be the best sweet treats you've ever had.  WHEN TO GO: they get busy and you may have to wait a few minutes, but because they are also a store, you can browse the aisles for european/asian cookies and tea and such while you're waiting... and its all worth the wait. so really, it isn't when to go, it's why haven't you already? the chefs in the kitchen are masterful and the staff will make you feel right at home... and, of course, it's likely to be some of the best food you've ever had!

I have only been once, this past Sunday, but left after nearly three hours. It was as if Sanford & Son had taken over an auction house. I kept waiting for TLC to show up with a camera crew; it was such utter chaos.  There must have been 600 lots up for auction, ranging from nice Victorian-era furniture to very cheap trinkets you might encounter at Goodwill. Auction lots were hand labeled/numbered with tape, but this soon seemed meaningless as there was no rhyme, reason or order to what lot was auctioned next. Mr. Brunk, the owner, would wander the room picking up pots and pans for the next item, or another painting, while the previous item was being auctioned. And there was no printout or listing. If you came for one specific item, or items, listed on their website, you were liable to be stuck there the entire day waiting, hopeful, that luck would be on your side and your item would be randomly picked next from the dusty hoard.  Mind you, just because your item(s) were listed on the website for that day doesn't seem to mean they were going to be actually auctioned off that day. We drove 42 miles from Chandler across the valley to Sun City for this "auction" only to be informed in Mr. Brunk's opening monologue (he should do standup) that they hadn't bothered to unpack or sort all the boxes this week. In short, for us, the items we had planned to bid on but couldn't find on the floor, were apparently still in boxes and would likely (no guarantee) be up for bid next Sunday.  Speaking of standing, we arrived to find a large building with easily 100+ seats inside, but most, if not all, were marked with tape, reserving them for "regulars" of the auction. We could understand this practice if, indeed, the regulars would bid on things, but from what we could tell, many of the regulars came for the bar-b-que sandwiches (pretty good), the cameraderie (fine, whatever), and the fun of a day out of the house in dusty, windswept Sun City, AZ. Within minutes of the auction starting, we counted at least six "regulars" already fast asleep in chairs that might have gone to actual bidders who were left standing around the room's edges.  After nearly three hours, we'd had enough. Mind you, these folks were pro's at getting people to pay $50 for chipped glass boxes you can get for $5 at the swap meet, which is probably where they found them.  If you're looking for "Honey Boo Boo & Family Go to the Auction", you'll find no better place... and the BBQ was decent.

Yupha's was featured on CHECK PLEASE, ARIZONA (great show on PBS) and we love this restaurant! This is our "spicy Thai" restaurant, and it never disappoints! Recommended: the papaya salad and the Pahd See Ew... both are better, and different, than I've had anywhere else. You can't go wrong with whatever delicious specials their chefs have created each day, and their teas and desserts are always wonderful too. AND, even better, they are just doors down from the Tempe Cinema's (the Tempe $3 movie theater), so you can have a gourmet dinner followed by a movie just steps away. ENJOY!

If you live in south Chandler, or don't mind the drive, this is the place for a nice sit-down, authentic Mexican meal.  Anything on the menu with Hatch Chiles will make your toes tap and your lips smack. The shrimp tacos are a personal favorite, and for breakfast/brunch, the eponymous "La Casa Blanca" is absolutely fabulous.  Chips and salsa are a staple at most Mexican restaurants, but here they are both fresh and delish, but careful not to fill up before your appetizers and entrées arrive. The chips are all complimentary and the salsa and bean dips are yummy, but nothing compared to the treats the kitchen will ultimately deliver.  What's the downside? It is always my intention to order the sopapillas for dessert, but I never seem to leave room. The rare occasions when I do, however, even these are especially good here.  By the way, this is a big restaurant with lots of parking, and lots of indoor and patio seating -- plus some great original artwork and sculpture to enjoy. All around, a great dining experience.

I've only been here twice now, but both times were AMAZING!  Great food, great service... will be back very soon.  FYI, you'll be tempted to fill-up on the out-of-this world salsa and dip which arrive to your table moments after you do. If at all possible, resist the urge. As good as these treats are, your entres will be even better.  Recommended are anything with the green chiles when in season, and if not, trust the Serrano family and their specials. We have been more than impressed thus far and will update this review as we go back again and again and again!

We are big Thai Rama fans... from the Thai BBQ Chicken to their several varieties of curries to their wonderful Pahd See Ew, Thai Rama offers outstanding food at excellent prices. On top of it all, the friendly staff makes sure everyone enjoys not just their meals but their visit, as well. It's not only a regular place we visit, but a "must do" place we take family and friends when they are visiting in town.

These folks might be able to kill bugs, but I'll never find out. What they can do is DUMP GARBAGE all over a neighborhood of mostly seniors, who then have to pick it up.  Preventive Pest Control uses leaflets instead of junk mail. Either they dump, or hire people, to dump hundreds of these flyers in neighborhoods advertising their service. Our neighborhood got hit last week. Since we're near Sun Lakes, many in our community are seniors. Did they need to be picking up 4, 5, 6 or more flyers/postcards off their driveways, lawns, flowerbeds, bushes???  NO! It's littering on private property, and nearly every house got hit! A week later, and walking around the neighborhood, you still see their garbage in people's yards, driveways, and in the street.  If they come clean up their garbage, I'll take down this review. Until then, they are more of a problem than the pests they want us to pay them to eliminate.  Maybe we should all dump our garbage at your house? Easy enough to look up at the ACC, you know.

Blu Burger is what all trendy burger places ought to inspire to be. Bison, Kobe, regular beef, chicken, fish and vegetarian options, plus dozens (if not hundreds) of bun, topping and condiment options that allow each burger-phile to create their own masterpiece on each and every visit.  In addition, the ice cream and handmade shakes are fabulous, too -- as are the sweet potato fries and, my favorite, the zuchini fries.  With no two burgers alike, you're going to wait 20-minutes-plus from the time you order until your tables' food arrives. Possibly longer if they are packed. But the wait is worth it, and if you're not enjoying the company of your dining companions in the meantime, enjoy great bar drinks, awesome original art on the walls, sports (generally) on the televisions, and great upbeat ambience that makes it a fun restaurant to visit.  Btw, there's a contest for all you creative types to come up with the Burger of the Month, which they'll promote and serve... and give you credit for, if selected. I much prefer to design my own, but some of the winners I've seen have looked mighty tasty!

Quick review and will expand more later because I've only been here once, but The Hungry Monk offers a great, great, great bacon cheese burger that was just out of this world. Will update once we've made a return trip and tried more on the menu, but if you're a burger fan, add Hungry Monk to your "must try" list.

WIth so many options for frozen yogurt and ice cream within a three-mile radius of this location, Tasti-D-lite is pretty close to bottom of the barrel. What promised to be a unique idea turned out to be rather pedestrian. The actual store's hours did not match their websites -- which is a bummer if you walk there and find them closing when you should have had another 30 minutes or hour. But maybe they were closing because they had no customers and just didn't want to stay longer. The frozen ice cream/yogurt (whatever) they sell does taste pretty good, but doesn't explain why they charge $4-to-$5 for a cone. This is Chandler, not Scottsdale. And for that matter, why would a cone cost that much in Scottsdale anyway? Healthier dessert options are to be applauded, but I'd really like to see stores go out of their way to serve our wallets as well as our waistlines.

BLD is the one place in Chandler that I really want to like, but after three visits, I just give up. They have a great-looking menu, a hip-kinda vibe, and all the promise in the world. And that's where it ends.  A disinterested hostess will invariably seat you in the one table you'd least prefer. Near the kitchen entrance. Near an angry baby. Whatever.  Next, one of several equally disinterested servers will arrive to take your drink order and by the time you've worked up a good thirst, drinks will arrive. If you're lucky, it'll be the drinks you actually ordered. If you're really lucky, they'll be good.  The one saving grace on the breakfast menu is the Monte Cristo. A+, seriously. Everything else is average, despite how it reads on the overpromising menu. And don't worry about the prices: just pretend you're in Scottsdale or, say, Midtown Manhattan, for the entire meal. If you remember you're in Chandler, you'll just get angry.  Like the breakfast menu, the lunch menu equally overpromises, but that's okay, because you'll wait just as long to receive your food. If it's not over or undercooked, you might as well just dig in and not think about how much you overpaid for a sub-par meal.  BLD looks and act like they want to be a BFD (big friggin' deal) but they need to start caring about both their customers and their food first. A good menu doesn't make a good restaurant if you don't deliver the goods.

this neighborhood bistro could just as easily be found in Scottsdale, Tempe, or any trendy locale... and probably should be. they offer sumptuous fare at great prices from a fun and friendly staff that make dining in a pleasure or carry out a breeze.  the curry dishes are simply amazing and what I continue to get. loved it!

Wow... who knew crepes could be so good? Well, probably crepe lovers, but these were really, really good! The crepe menu gets a 5-STAR review. Same for the staff who are friendly and helpful and seem to like being there and making sure you like being there too.  That said, the baked goods only rate 3-STARS, and were dry and underwhelming, despite their impressive appearance. At the table, I bit into my cookie with disappointment and remarked, "This is like having the biggest box under the Christmas tree, only to find it full of socks."   The real disappointment was the coffee, which is surprising because a bunch of college age kids in a crepe bar serving breakfast should serve a mean cuppa joe. This was not it. 1-STAR on the coffee.  But please remember, the crepes very easily get 5-STARS and after all, the place is called "CREPE BAR", so that's what you're definitely going to go there to eat. And probably go back again to eat. And again. And again.

Pecan Grove is THE place for pie in Chandler. We've been here once for brunch and been back at least four times since to pick up a pie to go. Yes, I'll admit it, we're addicted to their pies.  The restaurant: this is homecooking away from home, plain and simple. The food is good, and by all the empty plates, people are enjoying their meals. The prices are more Scottsdale than Chandler (a bit steep), but the quality and the care is there. When we went, they had just opened a couple weeks previously, and were still going through some growing pains, but aside from an overabundance of staff mulling about, there's nothing much to gripe over, and we'll assume the owners will figure out their staffing issues soon enough.  The pies: did we mention the pies are to die for? You may ask, how good can pie really be? Well, forget store-bought pie, forget Marie Calendars, forget... well, forget the rest of them. Stop in at Pecan Grove and grab a slice. There are two kinds of apple pie, and I recommend them both: traditional with crust on the bottom and top, and then French apple with the cinnamon crumbles on top. I don't know which is better, only that I don't like going two weeks without a slice of one or the other. They're that good. The pecan pie was also incredible, and if I could stop ordering among those three, there is an intensely beautiful lemon merengue I'd love to try, but haven't gotten to, just yet. Curses, apple pies!  Finally, to top it all off, I had one of the best cappuccinos of recent memory here, and with my slice of apple pie, it was a moment of true bliss.  Speaking of which, if your table's bill reaches $35, you get a free pie of your choice to go. Let me tell you about the apple pie........

Chandlers newest Thai restaurant is fantastic! We're picky about our Thai food and Phuket was amazing! We're working our way through the menu still but it's been a fabulous journey so far. The staff is friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. A true treasure worth visiting over and over!

As a fan of good breakfasts, I was thrilled to try the newest addition to the neighborhood here in south Chandler. Put simply, my chorizo omelet was muy bueno, and clearly cooked by someone who loves omelets as much as I do. Beautiful fluffy eggs, savory chorizo and fresh veggies. Loved it. The pancakes were very good and the coffee was decent. Crank that coffee up a notch and I'd have no trouble going five stars for breakfast. Last note, the staff is wonderful. They took great care of us and every table around us. And that's just awesome.
