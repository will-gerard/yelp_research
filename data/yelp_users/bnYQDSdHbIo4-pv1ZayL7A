I am sorry to have to give this place a bad review but my experience last night was pretty bad.  I ordered food to go, it cost me around $11 bucks for a plate.  I ordered cashew chicken and got 4/5 hot.  I get the food home and was starving at this point.  The entree was basically soup; so soupy it was very messy to eat!  Not much chicken, good degree of hotness, too many onions, and I swear there were no cashews.  The white rice also didn't taste right to me, but that's easy to get wrong.  After I ate it all I was still hungry and basically NOT very satisfied.  For $11 bucks I would have done better to eat panda express if I was craving some sort of asian.  The best part?  I believe they use MSG or too much salt or something, after eating I developed a severe headache which I went to bed with.  After drinking tons of water I hoped it would be better in the morning.  I was dead wrong.  This morning I woke up with a migraine and the same salty taste in my mouth that I can't get rid of from last night; I've never been sensitive to headaches in the past but today is simply unbearable.  For the money I would definitely advise avoiding this place.  Sorry Mint Thai!

One of the worst dining experiences of my life.    We came in one night with a Groupon and I was very excited to try a new Thai restaurant considering my thai food experiences in Tempe, Gilbert, and Phoenix so far had been very very good.    Well I guess coming in with a Groupon makes you a criminal.  At least that's how we were treated.  The tom yum soup we had was 99% liquid with not much in the way of substance.  It also did not taste like the tom yum soup I grew up with or have had at other restaurants.  It was "different" but not in a good way.  My fiance and I are Asian, we may know a thing or two about Thai/Vietnamese/Cambodian/Chinese food.  Well apparently we don't because when we complained our papaya salad tasted like chemicals the owner relayed the message to our server that we could not substitute it for something else.    You read that right, the owner relayed the message to our server.  Not once did we get the pleasure of meeting the owner of this awful establishment.  I don't even remember what we ordered as an entree; in my mind I was still in shock over what had transpired with the papaya salad.  If I recall we even asked if we could order desert, no joke they refused to even let us order it.  Bear in min this was for cash money dollars over the value of the groupon.  Suffice to say I have probably already told 20 people to avoid this place like the plague.   This place really needs go out of business.

How American are your tacos?  This place is pretty good ~ I like my tacos American please!  This place was a Papa Johns back in my prime days at ASU but they did a great job of redecorating to make the place seem less greasy.  For a first timer what are your safe bets?  I would recommend tacos or vampiros (basically a tostada) but would caution against the breakfast burritos, the one I had wasn't very memorable.   I do fancy the Cochata and anything with pastor (pork) in it.  I've also heard their ceviche is excellent but they only have it on Fridays!  THE MEAT:  The reddish pastor is very tender and has some sweetness to its flavor.  The carne asada (beef) in comparison is quite salty and is akin to cubed steak so they bits will get stuck in your teeth.  The garnishings they use are different depending on the meat you pick so be sure to try both before picking your poison.  They also seem to randomly give you guacamole, raddish, and/or cucumber as bonus sides; I'm still scratching my head as to the methodology and purpose here but I'm not complaining.  In the mood for a good taco?  America's Tacos is a great choice.    The benefits outweigh the negatives and I return here quite regularly!  Things I like:  -Outdoor patio very nice -Food takes a little while to make, that's how you know it's good -Pastor on everything -Corn tortillas! -Vampires (vampiro) ftw! -Cochata will change your life -Hit up their website for their story, it's always cool to read up about successful food establishments  Things I don't like:  -Don't let the menu fool you, it gets expensive fast and the portions are small so find some coupons. You're looking at about $10 for a man size lunch -Their happy hour tacos are smaller than their regular tacos so double up -Consistency is an issue, sometimes their pastor is excellent, sometimes it's a little tough or too salty for my preferences -Location is a little weird if you're driving there

We hired these guys for our wedding over a year ago (sorry guys I owed you a review!) it was a crazy huge event with over 350 bodies and Sonoran Jazz nailed it!  We come from very traditional families (ie crazy blaring asian music) and we were both worried at first that the change of genre would upset some folks but even a year out we are still hearing from our guests how much people loved the band.    We gave them examples of Michael Buble, Sinatra, and Eva Cassidy of music we like and a recommended song list and they ran with it.  Classy crew!  Give them a call and see them live, you won't regret it!

Funny business name but Rob is LEGIT!    What sold me at first on Rob is that with him you don't have to play the price game.   What he quotes/charges you may very well be higher than what you see in those coupon mailers BUT all said and done, I bet he will cost the same or even less after they come to your house and upsell you on special treatments, sq. footage, etc.    With Rob he is up front about offering you the best level of service he can give you without the sleazy sales strategies.    The cleaning itself was very thorough, my wife and I are very sensitive when it comes to chemical smells and allergies and we both have absolutely no complaints.  In terms of spot cleaning, our carpet is probably from '93 (we are not original owners) but he was able to get out or improve on spots the other guys couldn't.  We'll definitely be calling him again in the future!

We had our AC replaced and during the install/removal process had a unpleasantly large water leak on our carpet from when the guys removed the old unit.  Needless to say we're talking old gross moldy water here.  Having worked with Rob in the past, we gave him a ring and he totally came out for us on a random Sunday afternoon to get the water sucked out of our carpet and go over the rest of the house for us.  Once again, a great guy to deal - you won't be disappointed!

We've had Rob on retainer for almost a few years now, as always he's still the best in the biz!    Better book him now before his clone arrives :)

I feel like the Elephant in the room saying this but Food Truck Friday in Phoenix sucks.  The experience has disappointed me every single time I've been.  Don't get me wrong, I love supporting the small guys and will happily pay for great food but the value proposition of FTF is terrible.  I guess it's the hipster culture that commands the high prices but it doesn't excuse mediocre food.  Price: Don't expect to leave on a full belly with any less than $20 in your pocket.  Quality of food: I know this solely is on the vendors but I've yet to find a vendor that sells anything that wants me coming back for more.  ALSO don't be a fool like I was and buy something based on the ingredients listed - make sure you SEE what you're getting first.    One time I basically paid $10 sight unseen for what amounted to a side of curry and rice from a vendor (I hate Indian curry and nowhere on the menu did it sound as if it were a curry). I was very not happy.  There was "Cambodian" something in the name which sold me on the "dish" (I am Cambodian).  Believe me when I say it was not Cambodian in any way shape or form, not even the rice was right.  The burger vendor is ok, it took forever and the meat was on the verge of rubbery, but at least it was filling.  Short leash is probably the best I've had, they are not bad in the taste department but you are paying $8 for one fancy hot dog all said and done.  No offense intended but they also serve their hot dogs in pita bread.  They call it Naan so they can charge you more for it and sound culturally diverse.  Ambience: It's like a Carnival, and that includes the crowd it attracts and the cleanliness.  Consider yourself lucky if you can find a seat anywhere, let alone a clean spot.  The parking lot is free I think which is super nice for downtown Phoenix.  It is a crappy rock lot though so don't bring your fancy car if you can avoid it.  In conclusion: Do it at least once maybe just for the experience.  If you want to feel like you are expanding your horizons or something go ahead, waste $20 for mediocre food.  I'd much rather eat most anywhere else though.
