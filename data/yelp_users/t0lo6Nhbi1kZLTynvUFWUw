If you are a Panda Express lover, you can go ahead and cross this place off your list.  This is authentic china food (See Eddie Lacy).  When you can find pork intestine and see whole ducks in the kitchen you know you are at a place that knows what they are doing.   The hot pot options are all delicious, the classic Mongolian beef is very good as well.  The tea tree mushroom hot pot is I think the most delicious item they have.  You cannot go wrong here on really anything you order!

Gueseppe's is hands down delicious Italian food!  The handmade pasta is delicious.  The Bolognese Ragu was so delectable with the 7 different meats hitting your palate.  The place is small so make sure you get reservations.  The owner is very nice and does a great job not only greeting everyone but making sure everyone feels like they are a part of something.  I cannot wait until I go back again!

I have never been to an allergist until I came here. Worst experience ever. I went in for my appointment which they told me would take 2 hours. Understandable, they told me in advance. When I was leaving they said "oh, we need to schedule you for another visit to do more testing." Turns out they charged me for an "extended visit." This second visit I was told it would take an hour, it took almost 2 AGAIN, because the lady forgot to do the other testing. My total bill was over $500 and mind you I have insurance through a Fortune 500 company. I called and left a message for Gina which she never called after two weeks so I finally called back. She was rude and said she had been doing this for 15 years and would barely let me get a word in. I don't recommend this allergist at all. They said that as an adult it's hard to detect allergies through the blood (which would have been one visit) so they had me do the tests on site. No wonder, 2 visits = more $$$ in their pockets.

Be very weary of this place if you are not a local.  We have been twice for karaoke and both times left very disappointed.  While I value a server for being cautious to overserve there is a limit.  The latest time we went I joined 3 of my friends for some fun and silly drinks and karaoke.  I have never been so fearful in my life to have 2 beers in a 3 hours times as the server kept asking who was driving home (no one in our party was drinking excessively).  Finally after the third comment my friend (who is a manager at a restaurant in the valley) complained to the person behind the bar who was apologetic.  Although I do enjoy the DJ and karaoke I won't be coming back to this place.

It has been almost 18 months since I was in Italy but I felt like I was there tonight!  As soon as you walk in you are greeted by a family of Italians, some with great mustaches by the way! I love that the place is somewhat small and quaint as it makes the servers easily accessible even when busy.  The food is absolutely amazing!  My wife had the eggplant Parmesan which was delightful.  I had the veal with wild mushrooms and pasta, so flavorful it was with the perfect amount of gravy!  Definitely will be back!

Take my review with somewhat of a grain of salt.  I have only gotten the Mexican pizza aside from other appetizers because it is so delicious I do not want to try anything else.  I usually do like a variety but this thing is directly from heaven.  I like this Scottsdale location because it is very intimate.  Their queso dip is alright, not very restaurant-like, it tastes like velvetta.

Claim jumper is alright, their healthy options are not that great.  The chicken pot pie is pretty good if you want your calorie intake in one meal.  Atmosphere is nothing great but and the staff are a little slow although friendly.  They do have happy hour which is a pretty good deal.

Coach House is the oldest bar in Scottsdale and the place is a real gem!  If you are looking to get away from guys without bends in their hats, frat boys and ladies that brain-dead this is your place.  Coach House is a very low key dive bar and that makes a mean cocktail that packs a little punch.  How many places can you go where they still have a spot where you can leave your horse.  They also frequently have BBQ's which is a treat.

Sapporo is a great place for happy hour whether that be with friends or co-workers.  There are a decent amount of TV's so if you get dragged there during a game don't worry.  They have Teppanyaki which we did not try but does give it more variety and a family style appeal.  Patio seating available and if it is nice out sit outside for sure!

Bobby's is a true delight, with happy hour everyday of the week you can get high quality food for not a small fortune.  If you have the opportunity sit upstairs as it has better ambiance and you are right there for the live music.  We have been multiple times and the music is always great!  There seafood always taste super fresh and I usually always go that route.  Last time it was my wife's birthday and we got treated to a complimentary desert that feed all four of us!

We arrived at El Encanto at 7 for our 7:00 reservation and we were seated at 7:30, it would have been longer but we said we would sit inside.  The server was pretty nice and the margaritas were actually really good.  The food was about average except the pollo fundido.  The fajitas were alright.  I think it would be more enjoyable at daytime as the lighting isn't the greatest and maybe another item would fit better.

Cabela's is a fun place to go.  While I do like the outdoors I am somewhat of a minimalist.  I like to frequent the restaurant here.  The food is good and it is nice to order something out of the ordinary.  The first time I went I head an Ostrich sandwich and it was very delicious, had a taste close to pastrami.  The next time I went I had the smoked elk sandwich which was very good, tasted similar to roast beef... I know you are saying why don't you just eat pastrami and roast beef but the taste are different so drawing a comparison is not meaning these are equal.  They do have normal food if people are not as brave.  Have a bite to eat walk around and enjoy!

I stopped in right before closing on Sunday, I wanted to make sure I did not stay after 6 PM (closing time).  Not only did the staff not rush me but they took extra time to explain and tell me what were the better products and deals.  They are cheaper, friendly and the store is cleaner than GNC.  Will be going here instead going forward.

I am not that big of a buffet guy so take that at what it is worth.  The food was pretty good, I wish there would have been more options but the staple Tomato soup with their version of cheese pizza was a very good compliment.  Aside from the tomato soup not really any of the other soups tickled my palate.  The salads were pretty good with a lot of options.  I think it is a little overpriced but I guess America is all about gluttony and they get their money's worth, I choose not to stuff myself completely... well not all the time.

If the best thing about a restaurant is walking in and reading the history about the namesake then you know the restaurant is not anything special. The view of the golf course was nice.  This would be a one star if not for Clifford and his amazing service! The first thing we had was the complimentary sliced flatbread and eggplant dip.  The flatbread was awkwardly moist and the eggplant was very bland (I love baba ganoush BTW).  I had the rib eye and my wife had the NY strip, both steaks were subpar but not horrible.  I will say that one of the sauces that came with the steak was phenomenal, it was called Roasted Shallot Cabernet Reduction.  If we go back to dine at the Westin we will go to Deseo.

Great options here, carry out, delivery or sit in.  We started off with garlic knots, yum!  The wings are good as well, nothing too hot for the sauce but still good.  Their blue cheese is better than the ranch.  Great options on the pizza toppings.  I would get margarita, pesto or the vegginizza.  Gluten free crust is so tasty! Liz was great and provided amazing service among great recommendations!

One of our favorite happy hour spots!  The king crab dip is delicious! They usually have live music either jazz or a Sinatra style flow.  The staff is very attentive and their complimentary popcorn is yummy!  My wife loves the infused bubbles drink and they have local beer.   We never go unless it's happy hour, but they usually don't disappoint.

Kona is one of our happy hour go to spots.  The prices have gone up but still a great deal.  We usually stick to the sushi but their flatbreads are very good as well.  They always have a seasonal Sam Adams so you don't have to get Asian beer or watered down American beer.  Our staple is the Bama roll but we do stray and get the wave and spicy tuna.

The one thing I love this place is that they have such a versatile menu.  You can go with the typical Gyros, a burger, a pizza or a salad.  The gyros and Shwarma are delicious.  You cannot go wrong with the salads as well, my favorite is the chicken curry salad (curry is just the seasoning, and it is not Thai curry).  There happy hour menu is pretty good as well with drinks mostly at $3 and Tapas at $2 (they are quite small)

Good place for a drink as the views are nice and there is always something going at the hotel.  I thought the food was a little subpar for the price.  I like that they make the guacamole right in front of you.  The entire place is wide open so it can get pretty noisy (we did not mind) Definitely enough space for children.

Great company to work with!  I have bought multiple homes and refinanced a couple times and this company was by far the best.  We were never waiting for a response and they provided so much information.  They even came to our house to sign our documents.  Jeff Ohm will always be our go to from here on out!

Crust is a small neighborhood pizzeria.  There are a lot of Chicago style pizza places and while this one is not one of them they have the best!  Crust's Sicilian style pizza is to die for.  Their crust (of course) is phenomenal.  The staff is so great that one time our friend said he loved the Mac n cheese so much he wished they made a pizza like it,  guess what they made it!  If you are sick of Oregano's and you have not been to Crust you have to try.

Tryst has great ambiance!  Whether you come for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  Their ingredients are top notch and they have a wide variety.  What is great is you can either eat super healthy, or indulge like royalty.  It took me my third visit to finally get something else besides the Hawaiian breakfast, it sounds wets but is phenomenal.  Their Asian kale salad and kale wrap are delicious.

Amazing happy hour prices.  $5 for a sake bomber, what that is nuts, getting tipsy thinking about it.  Their sushi is better than most in the valley.  If you can sit outside as it gets a little cramped inside.  The Chinese is good as well, I usually get the Mongolian beef.  If we lived closer we would go here over Kona.

My star rating is based in the fact that this theatre-meal place is cheaper than all the others in the valley.  The food is pretty good but to have know what to order.  The coconut chicken is delicious!  The pizza is not that great.  Their adult milkshake is yummy!  Reserve your seats before you go as you don't want to get stuck with the office chairs

If you are looking to dine in with some elegance this is not the place.  If you want to feast on possibly the best Indian food in the valley you have found the place!  Channa masala was delicious, garlic naan is fantastic and the chicken tikka masala is great too!  You cannot go wrong with this place but be prepared for a plan B as this place will sometimes randomly be closed.  Try to call ahead if you can.

Food is decent, the hoagies are good, pizza is alright.  We were enticed by a $10 gift card in the mail which came in a pair.  Unfortunately the gift card we grabbed was for February instead of January and David the manager wouldn't honor it. Will not be returning as there are better options that provide better service.

Central Bistro is easily located with valet but also with normal parking for regular folk like me.  The service is impeccable.  No hovering service but great attentiveness.   Have the drunk bread with prosciutto, phenomenal.  The pizza was wonderful as well, crust slightly charred and the base nice and chewy.  Will come back again!

The yard is a fun place, a playground for adults.  The only problem is the parking, if I lived near I would frequent a lot more so I didn't have to worry about finding a parking spot.  There food is actually really good and they do a great job with their homemade potato chips.  I like that they give you a mystery beer option, kind of a cool idea.  After the meal I went to destroy so other people's hopes that they were good at table tennis.  Great place to watch sports or have a gathering with friends.

Gringo Star is a great place for relaxing, watching some Indiana games and enjoying some old school video games and having cocktails with friends.  The service has always been really good.  You could say I am a little bias since I am an IU fan.  They did even go above and beyond when we had our Indiana crowd there and they made some local IU favorites for us.  Plenty of televisions, it is a plus that they have a front bar, back bar and an outside patio.

Nice place to get away from the hustle and bustle.  The place is small but quaint.  I have been there for breakfast and lunch, both were good.  Breakfast you cannot go wrong with any omelette.  For lunch I had the salmon salad and it was delicious!  The staff is super friendly and it is usually never busy.

Hopdoddy is great place if you are looking for a burger fix or don't have time to sit down for a nice long meal.  You order in line and then you will be seated.  A server will come by for drinks and to deliver your food.  Everything is local and the quality of the beef is amazing!  I usually get the El Diablo as I like the spiciness! The Green chill queso and fries is delicious as well!  The only tip I would give is they typically cook the burgers a little less than what you specify (i.e. if you like medium rare, order medium).

Great all purpose trail, we went mountain biking and the trail was wide open.  Beautiful views, you can even see University of Phoenix Stadium!  They have facilities and you can read some of the history of the valley.

This review needs few words.  Amazing food, great ambiance and CLEAN! Did I mention the place was clean?  Our server Kimberly was great and with the Hibachi style serving Francisco helped us seize our food.  Okay, started off with shrimp Ceviche, very fresh, just right on the cilantro. I had the brisket enchiladas delicious and my wife had the chicken burrito which was excellent as well! Their habanero sauce is spicy and a good compliment to any dish.  Definitely will be coming back and telling our friends

Delicious food!!! This place used to be X-tapas and they have done a great job remodeling it.  Nice open place with tons of windows.  I had Pappardelle Bolognese, the meats were so juicy.   The wife had the risotto funghi which was also yummy,  Definitely will go back.

Mountainside is a very clean gym with employees driven with keeping the guests happy.  Although we do not have any children they have great benefits with the kids clubs as well as their date night once a month where you can drop off your children for 3 hours while you have a date or run errands.  Although the price is higher than a LA Fitness if you are looking for a complete gym with the bells and whistles go here, if you are a minimalist you would be better suited for a Youfit or Planet Fitness.

Proswingz is a great way to beat the heat in the summer and makes you feel like you are right on the course.  You can get a round in with two people in about an hour and half (you don't have to wait either)    Nick and Zack are very personable, I have been to a couple simulators but have not had the customer experience that I have had here.  They are not stingy in giving you tips and stopping by to make sure you are having a good time.  I definitely would go back and actually did the next day!    Some people have complained about the putting but with the courses you are playing the greens would be just as fast as if you are were playing at the course.  You will not find better pricing for a simulator in the valley.  They will soon have beer as well.
