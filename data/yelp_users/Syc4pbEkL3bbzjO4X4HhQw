I was a bit nervous about the area at first, but it really seems to be ok in the lot.  There was a wait, a good sign for lunch at a place this size (its really a huge restaurant).  Wait was short though.  Service wasnt super speedy but not excessively long.     Not the food, we got Tacos, enchiladas, and chille rellenos.  (Spelling sorry). It was EXCELLENT!!   Some of the best I've eaten of this type. Even the beans and rice was great!!  The salsa was to die for.  Its the hot type and it did have a kick to it but not over powering. It would have been nice to not get all broken chips from the bottom of the batch though. Both basket fulls were all broken.   They have two dinning rooms, if your in for a quiet meal, ask for the front one as the back was quite loud.     I cant quite give it a 5 but the food certainly was.

Went there for lunch on 9/6/2013.  When we walked in the man at the front desk seemed uninterested and told us to seat ourselves.  We started to settle into a spot but got interrupted by a waitress who then seated us. Make up your mind people.  Menus came fast but without a drink order, we were both very thirsty as it was over 100 out side.  We also had to wait a bit long for the food order.  The staff seemed to pointedly ignore us and walk past our table again and again.  Our waitress eventually came to check on us but was so intent on speedily asking a quick question she started to walk away without a drink order again, we had to stop her.    Food came promptly, with our drinks, but it tasted so so at best, about take out quality.  We chugged through the waters and soda very quick but the empty glasses sat at the edge of the table until we finally had to hold up an empty glass and yell over for someone to bring refills. Rude yes, but nothing else got any kind of attention.    After we were done, yep you guessed it, waited forever for the check.  No excuse for a place with people at only 10% of the tables.  Another big issue:  They have a yelp coupon for checking in, even though it was presented at time of ordering, they WOULD NOT HONOR IT!!  Bad service, so so food and dishonest representation.  And we had been trying to get there for a long time.   At least it was cheap.  Update:  We were contacted by the manager regarding the coupon not being honored.  They said it was only for the dinner service.  Problem is, the coupon did NOT state that.  This makes it false advertising and constitutes fraud in my book.  Its called "bait and switch" draw them in with a false ad.  That only makes me feel worse about this place, can I take the one star back?

Husband loved his asada burrito.  Lots of tender meat and perfect spice.  One of his new favorite places for burrito.  Cant go wrong with the street tacos or corn chips and guacamole either.  Go on 1.00$ taco Tuesday and get a great value.  We don't just handout five stars to every place we eat.  This place is good!

Chips are very good (fresh and crispy).  Salsa is OK, just not as good as most restaurants. Everything else I tried was sort-of gross

Wow has this place slipped. I ordered the trio you see on tv.  Instead of the big bowl of ravioli they show on the commercial I got 3 measly pieces.  The chicken Alfredo tasted like a bad tv dinner over microwaved.    Bread was good as was the second salad.  The first had almost no mix ins or dressing on it.     Ive had worse, but not much.    With so many Italian places out there, this one is off the list.

Nice little hidden gem.  Mostly kitchenwhere stores, a few cute antique places, discount clothing and a bookstore.  They have a lot of 80s style quarter rides for little kids placed throughout and I give my daughter a handfull of quarters to spend when we go (careful of the racehorse it shakes her to pieces and she loves it).

What's the big deal about this place?  No matter what I order I'm always disappointed, and the prices are outrageous.    Really,  there are better seafood places around.  The Japanese stakehouse right down the road (other side of the 60) has great mahi and salmon!  The casinos all have crab leg and shrimp buffets!  Why waste good money on bad food?

Food is good but the portions are small.  Prices are on the expensive side considering how little you get.  I'm not saying that I would never go back...but Mimis won't be on my list to visit again anytime soon.

Nothing to get excited about.  The food is OK but don't go out of your way to visit this place....the prices are a little expensive for what you get and the food isnt any better than what you get at Filbertos.  At least the dinning room is nice, clean, and comfortable.  (unlike many other places in AJ).

This place has really gone downhill.  Golden China used to be my go-to for Chinese food in AJ but the quality and service are bad bad bad right now.  Perhaps when the snow birds return and business picks up they will improve, but on my last visit the food was horrible -old yucky and worse tasting than reheated cafeteria food.

Went for breakfast. Service was friendly and fairly speedy. Unfortunately food is mediocre at best, can't say anything really good or bad  about quality.  What I can say is it was a bit small for the price. Denny's and Coco's are much better.

Can I give this place no stars for no service!!  Pull into drive through and it's extremely slow as usual.  The guy comes on the speaker and says "I'll be right with you".  Nearly 5 minutes later a truck pulls into the other lane and is immediately helped.  REALLY!!  Do they think I'm sitting here for my health?  I leave and go to McDonalds, never a problem there   Every time I go here it's something stupid like this.  This isn't the first time I've left without service it is however the last time I will try.    This place needs a manager with a brain.

Great food.  Good service. Salsa is the best.  Enchiladas are very good.  I don't know what they put in the sauce, but damn is it good!  No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale.

Taste:  (most important)  I've been all over the valley looking for a place to do my wedding cake.  I even considered a few cupcake places.  Of the three specialty bakeries I tried (looking for cake rather than cupcakes), this place has the BEST TASTING CAKE COMPARED TO ANY OF THE OTHERS.  I loved the choc. cake and Bavarian cream filling.  I showed up one morning without an appointment and they let me try what they already had on hand.  I think its reasonable to assume that what I got to taste that day is a good representation of what I will get when my wedding rolls around.  Decorating:  flipping through the gallery of wedding cake pics, it seems like the cake decorators here can do just about anything.  Even the most basic options are beautiful.  The price quote I got for one such "basic" cake was a bit cheaper than what I was quoted for similar designs at the other places.  Once I started to look at some of the fancier options the price goes up a bit.  It seems like they charge a little more than some of the other places for sugar roses and stuff like that.  Service:  Knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating, informative and overall great, great, great.    FYI: the other little pastries they sell are very very good.  Its worth a visit just for that!!!!  Everyone! my wedding cake turned out great.  The guests loved it.  It was exactly what the groom and I ordered.  We where expecting to have quite a bit of cake left over but people just demolished it going back for 3 and 4 helpings!  My mom said it best "I tried the strawberry white cake with whipped cream tier...now I need to have some of the chocolate and Bavarian cream tier"

Food is as good as the stuff served in many sit down (full service) Mexican food places.  Lunch is a more casual counter service but at  dinner time they switch to a regular wait staff.  Great tasting house margaritas (especially when they cost $2.00).

I love sushi.  The sushi at this place? Expensive and its not especially worth the high price.  There are so many good sushi places in the valley.  The sushi tastes old and falls apart when you pick it up with your chop stix (BoOO).  The miso soup seems like its from a dry mix.   There are a few sushi places in town that are better quality and better prices. AKA fresher fish, better ingredients, and superior preparation.  Try: Sushi Creek:  If you don't mind a drive.  Very fresh, very well done.         Mido:  Authentic little place with fast service and great prices.          Koi:  Nice place to party and have sushi with friends (has now replaced Sushi    101 in my heart).

I love Mexican food!!! One of the first things I always try when I go to a new place is the Chiles Rellenos.  Its a great benchmark for the overall quality, "tastyness", and value of most everything on the menu.  Is the chili fresh and prepared well? (Hatch or not Hatch).  YES, YES, YES good job!  & fresh roasted Hatch chili!!!   Is the chili stuffed with a delectable Mexican cheese mix (or just  jack cheese)?  Well, this place uses a Good mix of jack & something else....no complaints.   What kind of batter? egg? breading?  Not sure but whatever they use it works well.  All in all, the Chiles Rellenos here are great!    Beware it's a very spicy dish so don't order it if you don't like it hot!    My hubby ordered the fish & chips?  I know!   But they came and they are beautiful, crispy, large, flaky, flavorful, awesome!  Looks like they do a good job with everything on the menu!

This place is a nice dining atmosphere for small groups and couples.  It's not pretentious or loud like many of Scottsdale's trendy restaurants.  It has a tried and true/ old family establishment feel.  The service is top notch. Our waiter was funny, polite, attentive, knowledgeable, and has pride in his work.  Most importantly, the food is worth coming back for.  As stated in other reviews the spaghetti and meatballs is really good:  The red sauce is awesome, the pasta is cooked perfectly, and the meatballs are seasoned nicely...moist with a good consistency and taste.  My husband's vodka penna with chicken was also good.  It didn't have quite the kick he wanted but he would order it again.    Good wine list.  Tempting desert menu.  Prices are a good deal.  This was our First visit but it won't be our last.

Its a small store and deli packed with italian stuff.  Large selection of pasta and sauces as well as desert makings.  We went for lunch to the deli.  I must admit, one of the best cheese steaks I've ever had.  Its a shame we live so far away from here, I'd definitely frequent this place.

Prices are reasonable and the food is always good.  It may be a typical bar food type menu but the food itself is far superior to what you will find in most bar restaurants.  I even like the food here better than the stuff they serve at some of the competition (chain places like TGI Fridays or Applebees).  In addition to good food Four Peaks has great beer and drinks.  I can't recommend this place enough.  Don't worry about the line or the bouncer checking ID at the door.  The service is always fast and friendly even when the place is full to the brim.  There is always a big, big crowd.  If you worry about the noise just sit outside under the misters...

I thought the food was great, very good curry!  My husband loved the spicy crispy beef.  Portions are large enough to share and the food comes out fast.  No complaints at all.  This place is worth a visit.  We will be going back for sure.

Anyone else have this problem?  I like to go out and socialize. I don't care if a place is a little loud or smoky (what do you expect in a bar). I have more fun if there is a good crowd, music I can dance to, and a full service bar that can make all those foo-foo drinks & shots I like.  My boyfriend on the other hand likes places without a lot of noise where he can just hang out, have a conversation and drink beer.  We finally found a place we can go that makes both of us happy: 16thh St Sports bar! This place isn't exactly a sports bar. Its defiantly not a club. Its not dirty, but DIVE would still be an appropriate description.  The dance floor + DJ and pool tables are on one side of the building.  The main bar, main lounge, and the big TVs are on the other side of the building.  My boyfriend can grab a table and hang with friends without having to talk over a lot of noise. I can leave my purse & cell phone with him and go to the other side of the place to dance the night away....When I get tired or thirsty I can go find him and take a break. I love that they have lots of bartenders and waitstaff working. I never have to wait long for a drink even when I'm not drinking with everyone else from a pitcher.

Loved the food!!!!  Seared Tuna was superb and the handmade pasta was excellent.  My faience could hardly keep from licking the plate.  Great wine choices,  great beer choices,  great staff, great atmosphere (for a romantic first date or casual drinks).  Was a little pricey (but we went all out with drinks, dinner, and desert).  There were quite a few reasonably priced entrees as well.  We will visit this place regularly from now on.

Good food at this little place.  Its pretty casual and the menu is mostly fried stuff,  but if your hungry its a nice place to stop for a bite.  They have more options than most small diners and some healthy choices. FYI Fries are very good.

Always been a big fan of Red Robin.  Love the burgers, love the fries!  I wish they would stop changing the menu on me!  Every time I find an item I like its no longer available when I go back.  I always find something else, but it makes it kindof hard to develop a list of favorites.

I have always been a big fan of Red Robin.  I love their burgers and I love their fries.  It's a real bummer that the last few times we've gone for lunch we've  noticed that both the service and the food quality aren't what they once were.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what the problem is, but the burgers and sides just aren't as good (lower quality of ingredients perhaps?  Less fresh maybe?)  As far as the service goes our waitress really did try, but they seemed like they were understaffed, and the hostess kept seating people in her section.  At any rate the service was slow and we were ignored most the time.  I think this last trip to Red Robin really will be our last.  Plenty of other places to get it decent burger around here.

I've never had a bad meal here!  It can get crowded, once you taste the food you will see why.  We love the entire appetizer menu.  You could also try the vodka penne de parmia...everything is so good.    Last time we went the waitress told us that it is ALL DAY EVERY DAY happy hour!!!! from now on?   YES.  I wish we lived close.  We would be here all the time.

Get a decorator in here quick cuz....this place needs it.  While your at it get some tables and chairs that are actually comfortable to sit on (instead of the hard, rickety ones currently in use).    The food tastes awesome and is  a very good deal with portions that are meant to be shared.  This place rates 4 stares easy dispite the uncomfortable dinning room.

Very nice and roomy dinning room with lots of prime seating outside.   A coffee snob like me can always smell out a nice coffee joint with a good barista like this.  Good ice tea too!  They offer pretty much everything you could want at a coffee place so just relax and enjoy!  Ps my husband won't drink coffee but he likes this place.  He recommends they get a few more snack options (scones or other pastry) but all & all a good place.

Yum.  For a casual eatery this place is a top pick.  The curry is awesome & the noodles are great!  Prices are cheap & the owner is so helpful with suggestions when ordering.  He warned us about the spicy dishes but as it turned out he needn't worried,  the medium spicy was very good:  nice heat, good spice & completely yummy.

We find ourselves going there now after we take our baby for swimming lessons.  She's 10 months.  They always smile at her and say hi.  I hate it when wait staff ignores her as she gets fussy when someone makes eye contact but doesn't say anything.  My favorite is the country fried steak and biscuit.  I'm a fairly large eater and it fills me up!!  Sarah changes up but always seems to be pleased.   Service is always fast as is food.  Refills on drinks are occasionally slow but not by much  We sometimes order avocado for the little one as she loves them but she usually eats off our plates. She has had nothing negative to say about this place yet.  Then again, she's had nothing to say at all yet intelligible to adult ears.     Three thumbs up here (one just a little though as its only an inch long).

Location on the actual farm...now thats farm fresh.  Very casual, Very clean.  Food is the typical Dinner experience but its nice to know that Joe's farm grill makes the effort to use farm fresh products whenever possible.    My husband loved the pancakes.  You can tell the cakes are from scratch rather than a mix, plus, they are griddle fried,  not just cooked brown on both sides (if you know what I'm talking about then you know how much of a difference it makes) and they use real maple syrup without having to ask.  you can also tell the eggs are higher quality than grocery store eggs...score.  It will be interesting to come out and have dinner during a time of year when more farm produce is in season.  I look forward to harvest time!

First time here. I only wanted a drink but I ordered some fried zucchini as well.  There was one person in front of me.  They only had one bag handed to them so their order wasn't to big yet I still listened to 4 songs while in line. Seriously WTF took so long!!!!!!!!!  Over 15 minutes for one car  Zucchini was a little over cooked as well.   By time I got my tea, most of the ice had melted and it was watered down as a result.   Ill never be back.

Large portions and very good food.  Don't sit in the dinning room you'll miss out on the happy hr deals!  Last visit I didn't even order off the dinner menu, I got a couple orders of sliders, some onion rings, and some zucinii off the appitiser menu (during happy hour).  THere was more than enough food for two.  What a great deal.

Best breakfast place in the valley!  I used to come here all the time when I lived in Glendale.  The omelets are great and the biscuits with gravy are one of the best items on the menu.  Sadly I now live across town, I will never find a breakfast place in the East Valley as good as this!

Food is pretty good for bar food, and you get a lot.  We go during the day with our kid and avoid the crowds.  Kids eat free when you buy something for yourself & its not a problem if she runs around the dinning area a little (the actual bar is situated separately) Plenty of room so its not a bother to others.  we would also recommend going for happy hour,  we never go anymore but we would if we had the time, energy, and a babysitter.

Skip this place!  Service is terrible.  The place was empty except for one other table but we couldn't even get seated because everyone except the bartender was talking in the kitchen.  We could hear them in there but apparently they couldn't hear us (Hello?  Do we seat ourselves?  Anyone back there?)  After about 15 min. of waiting (with the bartender just starring at us the whole time) the single table of  people in the dinning room told us that they just seated themselves so they could at least get some drinks started (They ordered a few beers at the bar and then sat themselves down).  We waited another 15 min. but no one appeared to give us menus, say hi, or take our order...the bartender pointedly ignored us also as he was busy...  doing something...  We finally left without ever setting eyes on a hostess, a waitress or the menu.

All you can eat!!!! Great happy hour almost as good of a deal!!!!  The sushi is made fresh and is very good.  They have selections for big sushi lovers like me (Alaska roll and Uni here are the best) as well as many fried or chicken options for people like my boyfriend who don't want it raw. I wish this place was closer to me.

Touristy place to take out of town friends.  It's sort-of old west.  They have live entertainment, fire pits, and chairs made of odd stuff.  Cool place for families with kids, but be aware:  Depending on what time you show up there will be some adults out to drink, and party.  Food is better than your average bar food but the prices are a little steep.  We went during a slow time of day.  The service was terribly slow and unorganized.  Even with no one there things seemed hectic.  Our waitress payed no attention to us at all.  On the other hand...the bar staff was fast, friendly and more than competent.  I sort of felt sorry for the bartender.  We had to keep asking her for things that our waitress was neglecting (napkins, silverware, water, where is our appetizer? etc.).  The bartender ended up doing her own job at the bar (and she was much busier than the people in the dinning room) as well as our servers job.  I bet she hated that (but she didn't show it)  We gave her a big big big tip.

Employees seem to outnumber patrons by 4 to one but "service" is still grumpy and slow.    Food is OK but nothing worth returning for.  Three stars are extremely generous when you consider the overly expensive prices.  The property and setup is very nice, this place has a lot of potential but currently they are not making it work.

We like the extensive menu.  Most of the items are pretty good.  Some of the items we have tried are truly great.  My personal fav is the Spicy Tie Chicken Pasta (or something like that).  The first time I ordered it I thought it was absolutely perfect:  Nice and spicy, pasta done al dente, some crunchy corn strips for texture...sauce is addictive.  Other times I've ordered it seemed less spicy (but still good).  Also a plus:  service is always courteous, place is always clean.

Compared to all the other buffets out there this place is probably my favorite.  They don't seem to skimp on the quality of their items like a lot of other places (Golden Corral or Souper Salad) I get cravings for the broccoli salad!  My only criticism is the hot pasta section.  The pasta is kind-of gross:  soggy with bad sauce.  Good thing for them I don't usually want mac and cheese with my soup or salad anyway.  Sweet Tomatoes is always clean with good service.

I love Mexican food!!! One of the first things I always try when I go to a new place is the Chiles Rellenos.  Its a great benchmark for the overall quality, "tastyness", and value of most everything on the menu.  Is the chili fresh and prepared well? (Hatch or not Hatch). Is the chili stuffed with a delectable Mexican cheese mix (or just  jack cheese)? What kind of batter? egg? breading?  (One place I went had a deep fried, crumpled saltine cracker crust that was surprisingly good). Are sides included?  Habanero's Chiles Rellenos wasn't all that great.  Far to many seeds left in the chili for my taste.  Just melted jack on the inside.  Mostly egg battered outside (not very thick).  I don't think the chili was roasted in any special way or given any other kind of seasoning...Overall it was Meh.  The chili came with a side of beans that were authentic yet a little boring.  Also included:  A little Spanish rice (also boring).  Pico was yucky.  They are very generous with the sour cream.  (I noticed that sour cream and guacamole are included in most dishes so you don't have to pay extra).  Cool.

Been looking all over the Valley for someone to do cupcakes for a wedding.  This place is So So.  I liked the stuff here,  they have a good selection on any given day compared with some of the other places I've been to recently.  Honestly, If  I'm going to buy cupcakes rather than just make them myself, I want them to be larger than average, decorated nicer than I would have been able to do myself, have interesting flavors, and be a little bit fancy.  This place don't fit the bill.  If your willing to leave Mesa I would recomend Caketini (in the San Tan).  If you need a place closer to Mesa...go to Mind over Batter.

I love the splash pad part of this park but it's closed the summer and there isn't much in the way of an alternative activity for a hot summer day...

we had a craving for pizza And drove to Casanova Brothers from Apache Junction because of the great reviews.  The man behind the counter greeted us immediately and introduced himself as Tony (an owner) and asked our names.  He then asked if we were first time visitors.   Incredibly friendly.   My wife got the white pizza and I got the meat calzone.  We also ordered garlic knots.     He brought the pizza and calzone and put it down saying our names as he did. Great memory.  The calzone was huge and it was only the standard size one, not the large.  Its enough for two normal eaters.  Both items were awesome.  the red sauce is great,  the flavor of the meat calzone is super delicious, any one item was worth the trip by itself.   I wish it weren't such a long drive because this is a definite return.   AWESOME!!

Liked the food but the dinning room was pretty uncomfortable.  I didnt see any seating  in the whole place that looked like it would have been an improvement so we kept our table close to the kitchen.  Its upscale and decorated accordingly, but its nether romantic or welcoming.  I'm not even sure that this space was meant to be used as a restaurant dinning room.  My Husband and I had dinner and dessert here on Valentines day...The salad was interesting as well as tasty and my Ahi was very good served on a bed of greens with a nice avocado sauce and other veggies.  My husband was a little disappointed with his steak, not the flavor or preparation, just the size (theres no way it was even 4oz) pretty small for the price.  All and all there are plenty of better places to dine in the valley that are more convenient to get to and a better meal for your money.  We wont be going back.

We preferred the more traditional meat and cheese pasty  to the chicken tiki pasty. Both are good but the mustard sauce and gravy that come with the meat n cheese are an absolutely the perfect compliment to the cheesy, flaky pasty.  Tried and true comfort food combinations.  Love the flavors and the red wine gravy is indeed very tasty.  My husband is a big eater.  He recommends getting one or two sides if your hungry and want to fill up ( I was fine with just a pasty).

Love the Pizza every time!!!  We come here for late night dinners once in awhile.  We  are never unhappy with anything!  the food, drinks and service are always great.  The extensive beer menu has allowed my husband to discover a few good beers that he never would have tried otherwise.  When he finds something he likes we can go to BEVMO and order them in bulk to have at home.

We've been there twice, i had the tortellini paisano both times.  Now keep in mind i was stationed in Italy for 6 months, this is one of the best dishes I've ever had, PERIOD!!!  You must have desert!   The house Cab is great too.  Infact everything was top notch!!  The owner (i think) was friendly like you were a guest at his house.   Steve (if i recall correctly) was out waiter and he was great also.   Its a bit of a drive for us but well worth it.    I only have one small, minuscule complaint, why is there a TV?  The atmosphere is great but a tv is more dinner vs fine dining.     A five star among 5 stars,  just dump the tv.

The sushi here is super awesome.  Sushi creek has the freshest, best quality ingredients of any sushi place I've been to in Arizona.  No REALLY, its noticeable how good and fresh the seafood and greens are in this place.     Why oh why does this place have to be all the way in Queen Creek?  Best sushi place ever!!!!!!   The rolls are a little expensive, but the servings are large (about twice the size of a normal  8 Pc roll).  The drinks are also good, with plenty of nice bar choices.  I had the Lollipop roll and the spicy tuna with garlic roll.  The lollipop roll was especially good.  I can't wait to go back.  All the drink and food specials sounded really great....My meal also came with fresh edamomi and  a nice miso soup.

Still a great sushi place.  The lollipop roll is fresh and overall awesome and the vegetable tempura is done right ( and a large portion).  Ranking all the sushi places I've been to in Arizona,  this place is an easy second place (right behind Osaka on power in Mesa)

The banana-nut oven baked pancake was like nothing I have ever tried before....awesome.  The problem is, you only get one and they aren't filling enough to be the one and only thing a person eats for breakfast.  Just one skinny pancake a little smaller than a dinner plate? for $8.00? That's it? So I ordered a side of eggs  ($2.00).  Next time I'll go somewhere else.  My boyfriend hated his Waffles.  He said:  "an Eggo is about the same size and would have tasted better".  He also had to pay extra for 2 eggs and 2 strips of bacon (more like 1 strip broken in half).    We spent over $38.00 (including a tip for the nice waitress) for our breakfast. FOR BREAKFAST.  My pancake might have been impressive and different, but it ain't worth that...It's worth 2 stars instead of the 0 stars this place would get otherwise.

The only place I have found that is better is Caketini (all the way in the SAN TAN village).  Caketini has a better ratio of cake to icing (rather than this place that has more regular size cupcakes with very fancy and large decorations).   This place has the most knowledgeable (and nicest staff).  It's decorated all girly and glittery.  Very cute.  Take your little girl with you and have some fun mom N daughter quality time, she'll just love it.

Bruchetta at happy hour...awesome.  Real chef prepared food (not prepackaged nonsense like most restaurant chains).  Nicer than average wine selection (reasonably priced).    The very good food was the only thing to save this place from  complete disaster.  If they get the service up to par they could easily be 4 star (I might even give them a five).  That being said.  The service was slow and seemed to have trouble communicating with the kitchen.  They brought our food out separately rather than all together so some of us nearly finished before others in our party even had food!  Some of the restaurant's  management types were sitting at the bar doing something...they seemed oblivious to what was going on inside the establishment!!!  BOOOOOO.  So sad to see a place with such potential be mismanaged so badly.

I take back what I said about II Vinao being mismanaged.  I guess they where just having an off day.  The owner contacted me wanting details so that all problems could be fixed.  How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted.

Anyone living in AJ knows that they are going to have to go elsewhere for a decent dinner out.   This place is a little casual, but they have the very good Mexican food.  Freshly prepared, defiantly the real deal.  Delicious!  Very friendly people and the prices extremely reasonable.  Finally a restaurant in AJ that's NOT embarrassingly bad!

Yum.  Good egg rolls, no make that great.  Some of the best egg rolls I've ever had.  Portions are very good sized and quite tasty.  Sorry, didn't like the egg drop soup. Then again, I don't like egg drop soup.  Service is sometimes a bit slow but food does come fast after the order is taken.  They do takeout also and expect a lot.  They don't short the take out orders like I've seen in the past.  All in all I'd say this is one of the better Chinese places in the east valley.

So i'll start off by saying its not the best BBQ in the world, but its definitely one of the better ones.  Especially for a large high volume chain.    I'll start off by saying I don't like corn bread, but the way they do their's is awesome!!  They have two platters, I usually always get the large even with only two people for a TON of leftovers. It normally serves 4-6.    Brisket is tender, ribs are fall off the bone, corn is sweet and never dry.  Even the pice of bread under the brisket is something to savor.  We even found ourselves buying their sauces (they have 6 if I recall) and the pickle chips.  Oh those pickle chips..  Buy the BIG jar at costco!!    Can't say anything about the price as BBQ is always expensive, but this is at the lower end.  If you have BBQ in mind and your not from Texas or Oklahoma, then don't hesitate with this place.  If you are from Texas or OK, tell me what you find here.    PS, i've been to other Famous Dave's and they are just as good, very consistent.

We have been here a few times, and it's great every time.  If you order off the dinner menu you won't be disappointed.  If you get the dinner or lunch buffet you'll be in paradise.  The only problem I have ever had with the food was a lunch lamb kabob that was overdone (no ones perfect all the time).    It simply can't be overstated, Everything here is soooo good.  India Oven has some of the best service I've ever received at a restaurant (every time).  Don't be intimidated if you are unfamiliar with Indian food, the staff are great about helping newbies and answering questions.  Prices are reasonable enough to go often rather than just for special occasions...so give this place a try.

I Ordered the sweet potato sandwich and liked it a lot.  I'm not sure if it was the sweet potato itself or the fig sauce that tasted so sweet (actually a little to sweet for my preference) but the sandwich had a great flavor & was a reasonably hEalthy option.  I loved that this sandwich was very fresh tasting and made with good quality ingredients.  It was also large enough that I didn't need to order anything else so I saved my chocolate chip scone for later.  I Will be going back!

Been looking all over the Valley for someone to do cupcakes for a wedding. This place has the best cupcakes so far!! Lots of choices.   I loved the Chi and tuxedo flavors. Soooo good. The Chi really did taste like a creamy, sweet, strongly brewed chi!! The tuxedo was a rich and moist chocolate cake & a very flavorful vanilla cake topped with a whipped cream icing and chocolate drizzle. My boyfriend liked the Mint cupcake. It had a very strong mint flavor with a chocolate fudge icing and fudge filling.   We bought a 1/2 dozen to take home and try. Each cupcake is a larger than average size. We split each one in half in order to sample as many flavors as possible. We enjoyed each and every one. The flavor of each cupcake is recognizable by taste and smell. All are moist and have the right ratio of icing, cake, and filling.   Honestly, its not just the flavors that sold me. If I'm going to buy cupcakes rather than just make them myself, I want them to be:  Larger than average  Decorated nicer than I would have been able to do myself  Have interesting flavors  Fancy and elegant looking  Most other places just sell regular size, regularly decorated cupcakes.   Caketini cupcakes have everything I'm looking for. My only criticism is that they could step up the cake decoration / presentation a little (Mind over Batter in Tempe has pretty / fancy / elegant decorations on their cupcakes). If your just looking for treats (not a wedding caterer) Caketini is the best.

Very good food.  I had the gyro and eggs.  My boyfriend had country fried steak and eggs.  All Very flavorful, not overly greasy.  Ice tea was good (something I always look for).  Cinnamon roll to share was 2.75 HUGE.  For that price you might as well give it a try.  It was pretty tasty!  Busy place yet service was still good.   If they let a little sunlight in the place it would improve the atmosphere a lot.

Clean, fast & attentive service.  Food is cheap and flavorful.  Order a few things to share cuz you won't have worry about an outrageous bill.  Spicy beef satay soup was very good and the lo mein was everything could have hoped for: A nice mix of vegetables done just right, noodles that weren't  soggy, and a very tasty sauce.

I love chang's spicy chicken!!!!! ( I ask them to make it extra spicy).  We come here with family whenever they're in town and we never have problems even though we have a big group.  Big groups are the way to go at this place!  That way everyone can order something different and you can try lots of things...everything is good.

I'm a big fan of the food and drink offered here.  Lots of noodle and stir fry places put a lot of green/red peppers and bamboo shoots in the mix so they can skimp on the good stuff (meat and other veggies).  This place has a good balance of ingredients in all of the dishes I have tried.  My boyfriend commented that he really likes the noodles, he was sad to finish them off before he had eaten all the chicken in his curry.   The bar has a lot to offer but the prices are a little steep considering the happy hour specials other places in the area offer.  The food on the other hand is very reasonably priced with large portions.

This place comes highly recommended within my little group of friends but Overall wasn't super impressed.  I ordered the tika masala chicken & it was super good one on the best flavored masala sauces I have eaten anywhere.  If only everything on the menu was this good.  My husband ordered goat.    It was mostly grissle and bones.  the little bit of edible meat was dry and tasteless.    Nann is also dry and tasteless.  Prices are expensive.  There is no buffet.  service is terrible (rude, sloppy, listless, and supper supper slow).

Been looking for a place like this.  Great Asian lunch specials!    One soda and one FRESH brewed iced tea First they served a great Miso soup. Then we got a nice iceberg lettuce salad with a tasty dressing. Then we got our main dish.  I ordered the: 2 sushi rolls of my choice                                                     friend ordered: Asian beef with steamed rice  Sushi was fresh and put together well (not loose and falling apart).  I recommend the eel and cucumber roll.  Very good!  My friend liked his meal as well.  He even poured his left over sauce over the last of his rice he liked it so much.  Total bill 15.95.  We added a 25% tip to that because the service was good, just a little hard to understand (she got everything right in the end).

This place just wasn't for us.  I had the roasted chicken which was perfect.:  Nice flavor, tender, moist, and not to greasy with the skin left on.    My husband had the rack of ribs.  He prefers his ribs moist, fall off the bone, with lots of good sauce and no "char" on the outside.  Unfortunately for him this place does ribs with slight "char" and a dry rub that has cloves in it.  He wasn't a big fan of the flavors or the meat.  Normally he would just put a little extra sauce on it and be OK, but the sauce options are no good at all.  The Sauce:  All three flavor options (Sassy, Spicey, Sweet) have the same watery consistency and they all taste pretty much the same.  (They all look different but I would be hard pressed to tell them apart).  Each one is pretty heavy on clove and molasses which you can taste distinctly.  (I guess you would have to use a lot of molasses to cover the bitterness of so much clove and vinegar).   The staff is nice and the place is clean.  All the sides we tried are awesome (corn stuff, baked beans, slaw, potato salad).  All and all this place may be worth a try for you, but our preference is for a different kind of BBQ.  We wont be going back ourselves but we wouldn't tell people to stay away.

They were quick to help and answer questions. Very friendly.  They also have a nice selection of freshwater fish which is rare.  I had a special request for green sailfin mollies.  They took my number and called two weeks later, they got a bunch in and gave me first choice.  I'll go back for more when I need to.

The food wasn't anything special.  I ordered the  blueberry pancakes they were super large and tasted ok but they had hardly any blueberries.  Big bummer.  My husband had some sort of chipotle biscuits with gravy that sounded great... But he didn't like. service was very good the restaurant itself seemed nice and clean.  but as far as breakfast goes we probably won't be returning

Blaaa.   First, its a long drive across rocks to park.  Not hospitable for nice cars.  Then its kinda confusing where to go if youve never been there before before.     I finally found the mud bog bleachers and sat down.   It wasn't long before some kid in his early teens showed up and proceeded to run up and down the bleachers the WHOLE night.  Very annoying.  He must be a regular because many others seem to know him.   His older brother, was tossing rocks at him and hit me on one occasion.  Yea, i love to have a moron throw rocks at me while trying to hit his retard brother.  Those two idiots alone made me not want to come back.    There were no real races.  Only a few real good mud bog trucks were even there.  One young woman in a Dodge kept getting stuck.  I just wanted to yell "give it up and quit spoiling it for real drivers". But alas, she was apparently a regular also.   They should go to Tennessee and see what a real mud bog race is!     Ive been eyeing this place since i moved to the east valley five years ago.  After finally going, i should have went to a movie instead.  Ill never go back.

First time I was here was for lunch. They were a little rude, service was slow and food was so so.  After hearing glowing reviews from people and seeing the reviews here, we gave it another chance.  Well, the first time must have been a bad day.  Been back 4 times since and it's great.  I usually get one more dish than we have people for leftovers.  Can't fault anything now,  great not only for AJ (most AJ restaurants stink) but anywhere I've been.

Empanadas are tasty but you will have to order a pile of them to have enough to eat for dinner.  I would recommend this place if your looking for appetizer portions of tasty food to go with your drinks but be prepared to spend a lot, no good deals on drinks.  Stay away from platters they are overpriced by about $6.00.  If you are going to try it out just get the empanadas and order a rice n' bean empanada instead of a combo or side order.  Allow plenty of time service is slow

The menu is large for such a small place.  Plenty of the choices, all looked appetizing.  Lots of healthy options as well as "regular food".  We got there early, I don't think all of the bakery items had been put out yet I think that's why the bakery selection seemed limited.  The cupcakes and pies that they did have displayed looked very tempting.    It sounds like a small thing, but one of the items I like the most is their fresh ice tea.  It's so nice to find a place that offers real-good-uncomplicated tea.  I usually don't care for herbal tea (I drink regular black tea unsweetened) but this stuff is soooo good.

All pizzas are the same price regardless of toppings. They just give you a bit less of each if you want a lot of different ones.  Salad is the same price as the pizza.  You get a lot for your $7.95. Pizza was really good but not the best Ive had. Salad was great and huge.  Pizza dough is also pre warmed as you order (little press thing) so it was really quick.    All in all, we'd go there again an recommend it to anyone.

Good for fast Teriyaki. A bit more expensive than Panda.  Better atmosphere and fresher.    $12 bucks for a plate and a drink you may be better off at regular sit down restaurant.  You do get quite a bit however.

Five bucks is cheap for all day pass for our little one (2 years).  We leave to eat lunch and comeback then leave  to shop and comeback.  Great fun for her and a lifesaver for parents that just want to change it up and keep the baby happy during a long day out.

I love the format of this restaurant.  The bowl choices are great.  Pick your base (noodles, rice, lettuce, etc), then mix-ins (various meats and veggies), then the sauce. I got noodles and Szechwan.  It was spicy, be ready for it.   My wife got teriyaki.  She thought it was a bit to sweet.  All in all, very fast service, a lot of food and only $8.00.  Not the best in the world, but still very good for a quick lunch.  Well worth the trip.
