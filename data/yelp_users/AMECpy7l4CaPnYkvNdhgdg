I can not believe that a place called the British Open Public did not have the British Open on! The bartender didn't even know what channel it was on. No one else in the pub seemed to care either. CHANGE YOUR NAME IF YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE BRITISH OPEN ON! So sad

The bar tender shayla Is amazing. Very attentive and personable. However the waitress Stephanie  in the main restaurant is very rude and disrespectful. Sit at the bar! Love the food and garlic knots are a must.

Most of the bad reviews here are from a while back. This place really has changed in the past 3 years I have been going. I can say as a regular it is the best its ever been. The food is great, the service is great and the live music is a nice touch. They are very friendly if you want to watch something on the TVs. The back room offers a great place to relax if you want a little quieter atmosphere. The other regulars are great to get to know. A pretty good place to just hang out and watch the game. Try the green chili mac n cheese, bacon wrapped shrimp, and of course the deserts. Everything is good but those are my favorites. See you there.

The best food in maricopa. Just had an amazing burger.for dinner. Bacon mushrooms demi glaze blue cheese and onion rings on the burger. Amanda is amazing. The service is by far the best in maricopa also. Dwayne the bartender is great. Take the short drive it will be worth it. Always something new and different on the menu. Good selection of beers on tap too.
