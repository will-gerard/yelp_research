My first time at La Grande Orange and I really enjoyed it! I totally agree with all the other Yelpers about the parking and pricing but also that it's so worth it once you get in there and see all the cool stuff they have while you wait for your food. I just tried the new LGO Chicken Salad sandwich and it was amazing!! I'll definitely be going back for more!!

My fiance and I had our first appointments at this dentist office and have nothing but great things to say about it! We both saw Dr. Erskine who is young, very friendly and down to earth! He took time with each of us to talk about any problems we might be having and gave practical solutions. The hygienists were amazing - they were so nice and patient! I think that I had the best by far - there has never been a time that I have enjoyed going to the dentist, so this is a first!!! Also check out their website for biographies of the dentists - there are two and I hear that Dr. Choules is awesome as well!!! If you're looking for a new dentist, definitely give them a try!

I'm having my wedding here so I thought it would be a good idea to check the place out beforehand by staying at the hotel. We had some friends in from out-of-town for July 4th so we stayed that night. We requested an early check-in for noon and went to the pool party which was so packed! There was a DJ playing music for most of the day and it was actually a good time. The food from Cafe ZuZu was so good! Defnitely a good place to stay if you can get a deal on the room!!

This place is great! My fiance needed to be seen quickly and waited for less than 5 minutes before being seen. The pricing was very reasonable, the office was clean and the staff was friendly!

I took my pup to this place based on all the good reviews from this page and I was not so impressed. When arriving for the appointment, we weren't exactly greeted happily - it was very noisy already (not the doggies but the blow dryers!) and the person taking down our information as well as how we wanted our dog to be groomed was barely listening and definitely wanted to be somewhere else. And while I definitely understand that feeling...it's just hard to be confident when you leave your dog there that you're going to be happy when you see the end result! Unfortunately, my feelings were legitimate and our puppy was almost bald! He barely had any hair left at all (what I was afraid of)!!! Overall, I've definitely experienced happier people and have left with a happier dog!

This place is close to my house, I've tried it twice and won't be going again. My experience with grooming shops has been that you walk in and can see other dogs getting groomed - this was not the case. This is a two-story house and there's a girl sitting behind a small counter who doesn't do any grooming but takes your dog upstairs to the groomer. Not a big deal, but sort of a weird setting. I met the groomer who suggested a haircut worn by another breed and I turned her down. She'd listened to me and he turned out looking really good. Their pricing was good too.  My second experience didn't go so well. The same (and possibly the only) groomer came downstairs to meet with me and poor little Baxter peed on the floor when he saw her. Of course, I'm thinking that I really wish he could talk right about now and tell me why he was freaking out! He's never liked going to the groomer, so I decided to just go with it anyways. I told the groomer to do the same as last time, came back to pick him up and she'd given him a completely different haircut!! In fact, it was the same haircut she tried to sell me on last time, except she never mentioned it this time around and worse - no one called to ask me if it was okay!!! Not to mention this is a really ugly cut! At this point, I'm furious and it was pretty clear to the receptionist who said she could have the groomer fix it but that it would be another hour! Unbelievable and no way was I going to put him through that again! So we left and I vowed never to go there again - I think Baxter's good with that too!

After reading all these great reviews, I decided to take my newly acquired beater car (only need it for a year - fingers crossed that it makes it!) to be inspected. Christina helped me setting up an appointment on the phone and she was super nice! After that, Bogi was my main contact and she was so helpful and informative!! She went over everything that was wrong with the car and then pointed out the most critical things that needed to be fixed right away. I could definitely tell that she understood my situation with not wanting to put a ton of money into an older car, and I know that most other auto repair shops wouldn't have cared about that at all. Bogi takes a very personal approach and that is why she has such great reviews from her customers. I will definitely be taking my hunk of junk back to 180!!!

I love this place!! I've been here 3 or 4 times now and have never been disappointed! So far, we've tried the rusticas, the thin pie, the mozzarella encorozza (have to get it!) and even the Club sandwich!! Everything has been delicious!! In addition to the great food, the service couldn't be better either - our servers have been friendly, courteous and always ask how everything was. Not to mention, I've seen each of the owners back behind the bar serving customers as well! It's a good place for pizza and you're not compromising anything in return!! Go already!

This place is as great as everyone has already said!!! I almost drove right past it - and I am so happy that I didn't!! I love the look of the place!! My fiance and I each ordered a burrito and also got chips and salsa - all for $10.00! Great food and cheap prices - fan for life!!

Bamboozled! Took my little guy to get groomed here yesterday and am still in shock over how bad of a job the groomers did! The haircut is completely uneven all over and I paid $40 for it! If you have a pet with any kind of length to its hair, then I recommend trying just about anywhere else. Not to mention that their pricing is way too high for what you end up getting...

We stopped by this place after the grand opening (free yogurt with coupon - had to avoid the crazy line!!) and really liked it! I think that the self-serve stations are a great idea and the frozen yogurt is really good! Cool decor too! While it was unclear to us that you pay by weight, we still managed to get out of there without breaking the bank! However, you will pay a decent amount if you get crazy with all the options! My soon to be brother-in-law filled up the big cup and used so many toppings that I couldn't even see the frozen yogurt - and he spent about $10.00!!! I definitely wouldn't avoid the place - just be careful not to go overboard and you'll be fine!!

Checked out this place on Sunday night and will definitely be going back! It's a great place to watch a game - there's tons of flat screens! I had the Tavern burger which was good and my fiance had the arcadia club with tater tots. The tater tots were really good! Good bar food and a nice place to hang out - what more could you want??

All the great reviews are true!! The ambience is great, especially on the patio!! I had the pizza - tasted amazing! My fiance had the Italian grinder and the best fries either of us have tried in a long time!!! Our server was really nice too! You have to check it out if you haven't already!! We're definitely going back!

I had love for Parlor last year...but I have to update based on my recent visit this week. My husband and I decided to stop here for lunch and had the usual hour before we had to go back to work. Well we stood at the hostess stand for about 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us! At this point, no one's frustrated. After being seated, we made our picks so that we were totally ready for our server...except...no one came over to us...for over 10 minutes! Now we're frustrated! I didn't mention this before, but it was not busy in there at all! After a couple minutes of eye contact with servers as they casually floated past us and even a friendly "hand wave" in the air to one of them who looked right past us as though we were totally invisible, we left. We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!

I'm loving Short Leash Dogs!! Walking into Old Town Tavern for drinks, we noticed their food truck right next to the bar and decided to check it out. What a good call! All the other Yelper reviews have summed it up pretty well, so I won't be repetitive! Definitely get your hot dog on the naan fry bread - you'll never want a regular hot dog bun again! Great service and one of the best hot dogs I've had in a while!!!

Autumn is fantastic!  I was a first time client and she made me feel completely at ease, listened to my thoughts and also gave great input!  She definitely made going to a new stylist totally worth it!  Plus, my color and cut look awesome and was exactly what I was going for!  I'm already looking forward to my next appointment!
