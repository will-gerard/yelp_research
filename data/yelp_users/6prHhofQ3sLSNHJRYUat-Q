These ladies are just FABULOUS! My little dog Woodstock is a pain in the ass to groom. I have been taking him here for about 4 years now. They are so loving and good with him. Just wonderful to deal with and their prices are fantastic. I can't say enough kind words about them. And. although Woody does not like to be groomed, he loves these gals. :) THANK YOU LADIES!!

So, I'll say it again! These ladies are FANTASTIC!! They do such an amazing job, and they are so friendly and accommodating. My two little boys can be a royal pain in the ass. They always go out of their way to take care of them, and molly coddle them. I was certain I was going to have to completely shave my little one (he is a papillion and his fur had gotten horribly knotted) but Nikki took the time to work on him (it took her a good two hours!) and he looked amazing when she was done. No need for shaving! They gave me a discount because of two referrals I had made, and what should have cost a ton of money, did not. They are so awesome! I cannot say enough good things about these ladies. If you are going to get your dog groomed, I would highly recommend Dog's Day Out. I won't take my little guys anywhere else, ever! Go see these gals!   THANK YOU my darling Nikki and Diane! You gals ROCK!!! And Woodstock is soooooo happy!   Oh, and my other little guy needs his dew claws trimmed. They told me to just pop in whenever and they would do it for me. No appointment necessary.

I usually just order there food for lunch. I LOVE their white pizza with garlic shrimp and the white garlic chicken. I order their wings suicide hot, and while they are not "suicide" by the mere definition, they are very delicious. They put fresh jalapenos in there as an added bonus. Me likey. I also really, really like their turkey sandwich and their philly cheese steak is the bomb! I am eating their antipasto salad right at this very moment and am very pleased. YUM! Their delivery is super quick and the drivers are ALWAYS SUPER NICE! I have ordered from quite a few different locations around the valley and they have all been very consistent and down right tasty! Kudos Street of New York! I am a fan. Oh yeah, I also like the fact that they are a local company and do a lot of sponsorships for local kids teams... that is always super refreshing to see!

Let me preface this story with the fact that it was not my little guy who I had to take in. I am dog sitting my friend's dog. They are on vacation. Dr. Alber and his amazing staff were unbelievable. I called at 5:15. They got me in at 5:30. Dr. Alber spent 40 minutes with me. Explained everything to me thoroughly. Little Rusty just has allergies and an eye infection but it was making him miserable. Dr. Alber gave me a plan of attack to care for it. EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE. $70 out the door, RX in hand and a tube of eye drops. I am in awe. I will recommend this clinic to everyone I know. I just cannot say enough good things about these lovely people. THANK YOU PRESTIGE ANIMAL CLINIC. YOU ROCK!!!!!!! I will now be taking my own little guy there. You guys are now the only vet I will ever use.

They were closed down by the Health Department. Go across the street to Chou's.

I RARELY give 5 stars- to anyone. But when it comes to my health, I am diligent in thanking the people who take care of me. I often see them having a thankless job, people being cruel and rude, and it makes me sad. I have been fortunate that almost everyone involved in my care has been awesome. Especially this place. Right down to "Timothy", whom I believe works in the scheduling department but was helping me to get my records. What a doll. So incredibly helpful. Also, the gal that scheduled my appointment, so helpful. But what most touched me is the technician who actually did my scan. It was ordered stat. I was running a few minutes late. I walked in, filled out the brief forms (I have been there many times before) and handed them over. My tech, Kim, was standing right there and waiting for me. No wait. She was kind, she was funny, she was interested in what was going on with me, she listened and she explained everything. She was just awesome! I am also impressed with the turn around time for my reports- less than 24 hours. The gals at the front desk printed them out for me no problem. Wham Bam. And Amy, one of the supervisors, whom I spoke with directly was fantastic. Thank you SimonMed Imaging. I am absolutely thrilled to have you guys on my "team". You are all great.

I never actually eat at their location... I get it delivered. Their food is good and their drivers are always super nice... but damn! They NEVER get my order right. How hard is extra red onion and NO NO mustard? It always comes the other way around: EXTRA mustard (HATE IT) and NO onions!! WTF. I called to complain and they didn't even bother to rectify it. BOO Jason's deli. You should make it right. It's sad because I do like their food... you cannot beat their potato salad.

Just ordered take out from this cute little place. First off, the gal who took my order was incredibly sweet and very helpful! Secondly, they pack to go orders extremely secured which is HUGE in my book. I have a jeep, things get bounced around and always end up spilling. No problem today. I ordered the Tom Kai Guy soup. Thai 5 hot (the hottest they have). It is delicious. I won't say it's the best Tom Kai I have ever had, but it was delicious nonetheless. My friend ordered pot stickers and they are amazing. Can't wait to try some main courses off their menu. Good thai food is something I have not been able to find near my office. So glad I found this little spot.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The actual restaurant is nothing to write home about. Little hole in the wall, next to an American Legion so the smell of smoke can sometimes linger in the air because it comes through the vents. That being said, the food is FANTASTIC! Order it Thai spicy and they mean it!! REAL spice. Not some place trying to cover it up with chili oils and such... it's REAL thai peppers. And it is delicious. Their Thom Kha Gai is one of the tastiest I have had and the Pad Sewee with beef was fantastic as well. The owner, "Little" is as sweet as sweet can be. I absolutely LOVE this little known gem.

I am so disappointed. Let me preface this with saying the lady owner, who took our order for take out was really, really friendly. Somehow the driver got the wrong address and went to the neighbors' house, but as luck would have it, I was outside and caught him. He was also super sweet.  Now, the food. We like our food HOT. HOT! Our gal had asked on a scale of 1-5 hot how did we like it. We said 10. We eat ghost peppers. We like it HOT. She laughed and said ok, no problem. The food came quickly (and we are a bit away). We ordered the sweet and sour pork, rangoon puffs, Hunan beef and shrimp and hot and sour soup. Sadly, the food was not good at all. Not terrible, but not good. When we order hot, we expect chili peppers to be used. They used chili oil in the Hunan dish and the hot and sour soup. It was SOOOO greasy I had to wash the lids off of everything because it was everywhere. And it was not hot AT ALL. The Hunan flavor of the dish would have been good, but it was SOAKED in oil. The hot and sour soup had so much grease, it was floating on top. And there was no meat in the soup. I am used to at least some beef and shrimp. Just tofu and mushrooms. It was thick, which I like, but I had to scrape the oil off the top. The rangoon puffs were tasty, but they came with no sauce. And the sweet and sour pork came with the fried pork in a container by itself, with the sauce on the side. Fine. I get that. They didn't want it mushy when it got here. I like that. But it was ONLY pork in the container. No peppers, no onions, no pineapple, just the pork. The rice was ok. But nothing to mix in with the pork.  I give this rating a 2 because the lady was EXTREMELY nice, and even called us back to apologize for the driver having the wrong address and stating she wanted to update their system so they had it right the next time. When she called, after we had eaten, we told her our food was NOT spicy at all, as promised, but said next time she would do better.  I will give them another chance because of their customer service and how lovely the lady was. But let's hope it doesn't come with a pound of oil in and on everything. I am so disappointed. I was excited to try this place. And it turned out to be like almost all of the Chinese restaurants in town.  Dear Golden Chef, Please, please, please! Use peppers, NOT chili oil. And add something to your sweet and sour pork. Because the batter on the pork, and the pork itself was pretty tasty. And your customer service was so wonderful.   :( :(

OH MAN! These wings were DELICIOUS!! Extreme honey habanero. LOVED the flavor. And I am so impressed with how they are cooked. Nice and crispy, but not overcooked and not greasy at all. JUST YUMMY! And the gals who helped me at the counter were just darling!! Really good service and super, super sweet.  The mac and cheese bites weren't anything to write home about... the cheese just isn't good. But hey, what do you want for $2.99? They were tasty, but not to die for by any means. Jalape√±o poppers the same thing... just okay. But I would definitely recommend this place for the wings. And I can't wait to go back and try the fish! The gal that worked there raved about it. OH! And I want to try the fried okra! MMMMMMMMMMMM...

Thank you Levi! We called on a Sunday at 5:15 p.m. Levi got here at 6:45 p.m. He was AWESOME! Fixed our air (thank you!) within 10 minutes and the cost was BEYOND reasonable!  No after hours or weekend trip charge. No service fee at all. THANK YOU Frederick and Sons, LLC. I will definitely recommend you for all A/C work. Plus, Levi was super cute and sweet!

I can honestly say that I am a yelper. And I have rarely, if ever, given 5 stars. I feel there is always room for improvement. This is going to be an exception to the rule.   I came home to a situation which involved an elderly lady, 2 dogs and almost 100 degree temperatures in my home. I called several A/C repair people who told me they could not get out to service us until the next day. I was panicked. My elderly mother in-law looked like a fish out of water.   I called American Cooling and Heating. The gentleman who answered the phone was so awesome! He told me they could get someone out to us IMMEDIATELY. He wasn't kidding. Our home is in a weird, caddywampus neighborhood that is very difficult to find as our home is behind security gates. Our guy Tim showed up within 10-15 minutes. Did I mention this was a Monday night, at about 6:30 p.m.? No questions asked, our guy showed up. And he WAS AWESOME!!!  Tim had our equipment replaced and/or fixed within 30 minutes. He was so genuine, honest and super cool to work with. Look, I am a chick who knows nothing about air conditioning parts. Or AC units in general. This guy took the time to explain things to us. Did I mention he is really good looking too? Ladies! I'm just saying! ;)   Here is the kicker part to their service. Our home warranty company refused to cover the repair due to us "not contacting them"... (this is a whole other yelp story in which I will write about that lousy company.) My landlord turned into an ass and said due to the warranty company not covering it, she was not paying for it either. Neither here nor there, this was not American's problem. I called and spoke with the gentlemen I originally spoke with on Monday, in a panic. I did not want them to think we wrote a bum check (which, at that point, it would have been as we thought between the warranty and our land lord, we would be covered). Do you know what the fantastic people at American did? They allowed us to deliver a new check! You have no idea what this meant to us. It was a big chunk of cash we didn't have on hand (not that it wasn't worth every penny).  There are VERY FEW companies with integrity and true customer service any more. American is for sure one of them. I am so grateful for their repair service, their quick and swift ability to offer it, their customer service, and more importantly, their human kindness and willingness to work with us. I will always and forever be thankful and grateful to Scott, Tim and the American Crew. And I am asking they mail me more business cards so I can hand them out to any and all who need air conditioning service. I don't know if they have a social media website, I haven't checked it out yet. But if they don't, I am going to offer my services to set one up for them and man it myself.   THANK YOU AMERICAN. From the bottom of my heart. You saved us from what could have been a life threatening situation to my elderly mother in law, and my two fur babies. I will forever be indebted and so grateful for your awesome services, and your incredible kindness.

I didn't get the chance to use Arizona Duke's services because the gentleman I had previously called showed up. But I definitely want to give kudos to Tonya for her awesome customer service. I had called a company previously and scheduled someone to come rescue us because our air had gone out. When he didn't respond to my calls or texts, I called Dukes. They were super nice and promised their tech would be out within the hour (on a Sunday at 6:00 p.m.) It was at this time the company I had originally called showed up and I had to call Arizona's Dukes back and cancel. Ms. Tonya was super nice and totally understood my situation. I hope my A/C doesn't go out again! But should it, I will definitely be giving this company a call back.

Had to go visit this place for an injury I had to my eye. Turns out I scratched my cornea (OUCH!) and I was absolutely miserable. This place was fantastic! They girl at the counter was very helpful, knew I was in a lot of pain and helped with all the paperwork and such. I was seen by the doctor almost immediately. Dr. Emil Slovak was just awesome! SUper friendly and kind and gentle. And the nurses were superb too. In and out in less than an hour. And VERY affordable! Thank you guys so much! Highly recommend these guys!

Dear Angry Crab, Specifically, Ms. Autumn (the owner) and Tyson (our server), You guys went above and beyond for us. And I want to take the time to thank you.  I called them on Thursday to see if I could possibly make a reservation for Friday due to my boyfriend's mother being elderly (83) and a cancer survivor who cannot stand for long periods of time. They do not take reservations. But the owner came to our rescue and accommodated our request. We "reserved" a table for Friday at 6. We were sat by 6:10 p.m. The place was packed. They completely jumped through hoops for us.   Our server was a darling gentleman named Tyson. ABSOLUTELY fantastic! (Although Autumn did promise we won't have to be tortured by him next time :) )  This place was PACKED! People running around, trying to take care of everyone, trying to serve everyone... craziness. The thing I noticed was EVERYONE was smiling, laughing, enjoying every minute (try finding that on a busy Friday night!)  We chatted with the people sitting next to us (both when we briefly waited for our table and when we were seated at our table) and the atmosphere was just one of pure enjoyment and laughter.   The food was above and beyond. We ordered oysters, we ordered king crab... we ordered dungeoness crab... it was just absolutely delicious! Ooooh.......... get the damn hush puppies!!! YUM! We ordered it at "level 4" which was perfect for us. We LOVE HOT! But the level 5 was just hot... 4 was much more flavorful.   I NEVER give 5 stars... but I promise you, this place is worth every one of them. PLUS, locally owned and operated, which is hard to find in Chandler, Arizona.   We will be back. Again and again! Consider yourself warned Angry Crab.......... you have created monsters! Soooooooooooooo good!!!! And such awesome service!!

I could care less if they are chain smoking peeps in an old retired police car... here's the deal: I used them for years when I lived in downtown Phoenix. I could beebop anywhere for dirt cheap, always on time. And I never waited for too long. These guys rock. I now live in Chandler. I have to go to an event Saturday night downtown. I call Sunrise and  say, "Hey can I get one of your dudes to take me home to Chandler and if so, how much?" (They do not usually travel around Chandler.) The answer??? Yes! Of course! The cost: $36!!! Are you kidding me??? These people rock. Highly recommend.  Far from fancy dancy. But def worth their weight in gold.
