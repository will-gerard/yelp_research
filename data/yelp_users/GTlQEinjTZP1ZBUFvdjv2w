We have been going to this place for years when it was a Neo Tokyo and was recently acquired by new ownership. It is now Savor Flavor. I'm glad they still keep the old menu and I get to try the new menu. We like the strong Vietnamese coffee. It's a bit creamy, but pretty good.   I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the portions are much smaller and pricier for fast food, but I guess we all need to eat a little less to trim down our waistline :-)  The service is nice and we like the new owners. At least they are nicer and friendlier compare to the previous owners who NEVER even had a crack of smile on their faces. Try it out and you won't be disappointed.

I found this practice by an accident turn and it turns out to be the most pleasant experience I ever had, visiting an eyecare doctor. I was impressed by the cleanliness and organization of the office and friendliness of staff. It was easy making an appointment and having your insurance checked out right away prior to visiting the doctor. Dr. Kelsey is very down to earth and funny. He made it very clear and easy for me to understand his medical lingual. He took time to thoroughly checking out my eyes, listened to my concerns, explained things that I can understand and gave me the best eyecare options to choose from. He's ESPECIALLY FUNNY! My surprise encounter of finding this office has become a very pleasant experience. Your office and staff are AWESOME. Thank you and please continue with the great work!!!

I love Mexican food, but most of the restaurants left me with a heartburn afterwards or the greasy smell and heavy stomach, but NOT Senior Taco. I love the freshness of the food and the the salsa bar. The price is very affordable and the portion is HUGE. It's around the corner from where I work, so it is convenient for lunch. I wish they open one near my house in Tempe. Just a thought!

I am a very picky Asian when it comes to Asian food. I usually am NOT very generous with my rating when it comes to quality of foods and services, but I have to give Nunthaporn a rating of 4 for their good food and friendly service. There is not that many good Thai restaurants in Phoenix Metropolitan area. One day, I tumbled into this mom and pop restaurant in downtown Mesa and have been going since 2011. The food is amazing. Their lunch portions are generous and the egg rolls are good. Okay, I am picky with egg rolls too because I do know how to make egg rolls The chef, kitchen staff and servers are friendly. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try.

A fantastic place for all types of BBQs, chicken, pork, beef. The BBQ beef is FANTASTIC! It's like Korean BBQ, but for a fraction of cost. I love this place! They give you a large portion for a fraction of price and the quality remains high. If you have a large party, then it's a place to go. Their catering service is awesome. I have dined in & catered out . The owners are nice and friendly. The place is clean.  If you crave for certain Chinese dishes, you can ask the owner to make some for you. Don't forget to try their tender BBQ ribs. Yum!!

We have heard Pho Ao Sen sold their restaurant and now there is a new owner. We've been wanting to try to see if it is any good compare to the previous owner. We ware so DISAPPOINTED!!!  I ordered Pho Tai #21 on their menu. My Pho soup was brought out warm temperature, NOT HOT. The soup was blotchy tasted like tap water was being poured in and mix with a bunch of MSG. The slices of beef were 1 inch thick when it's supposed to be paper thin, chewy and so AWFUL. I tried to finish the bowl because it costs $7.00 or $7.50 and I didn't want to waste my money. After finished eating, I had acid reflux and felt so ill. A gruesome experience!  My husband's bowl of noodles with meat and eggrolls looked boring and am sure didn't taste any better.  WARNING - Food here is pricey and the service and food were not the same as you got from Pho Ao Sen. If you want the BEST bowl of Pho for $5.00 go to 43rd Ave & Thomas, go to Mekong Plaza or go to Phu Thanh on Extension & Southern. You'd get better food there for a great value.   We will never come back to this restaurant again.

DISGUSTING FOOD with expensive price. The slice of beef for Pho is supposed to be thin and tasty, instead it's CHEWY and thick and very smelly. My bowl of Pho was so nasty that I could not barely have the 3rd bite and left the whole bowl untouched. I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Pricy and yucky food!!!

Sushi Catcher is very far from us, but I won't mind driving out here for their good dishes. The portions are generous. The quality of food is excellent. The price is very reasonable compare to other sushi restaurants. The service is unbeatable. I would come back here again soon. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who look for good service and quality foods for the best bang on their bucks. Recommend that you call ahead of time for reservations so you do not have to wait.

This place sucks. Food is awful and the price is not cheap either. I'm Vietnamese and I know what's good Vietnamese food. If there's a rating for NO STAR, I would give it a NO STAR.

I have been Stephanie's client for the last 4 years. She's very professional, upbeat and a cool hair stylist. Not only she knows what I want for coloring and cut, she also knows what products are good for my hair. I'm very impressed with her professionalism and . Every cut or hair coloring I did with Stephanie, it is quality and exceeds my expectation. I highly recommend Stephanie to any client and stand by my recommendation.

I am sorry for ruining everyone 's raving reviews about this place, but it was a total disappointment for me. Everything was salty and awful. It is overpriced for the poor quality of food. It's not an authentic Vietnamese restaurant. The restroom is nasty, dirty and gross for the supposed to be "upscale" restaurant. Nothing is upscale about this place. The food is only cater toward Caucasians and non-Asian groups who know NOTHING about fine Asian dining. However, I am VERY Impressed with the outstanding service which you can hardly achieve that in any Asian restaurant. For the wait staff, I would give a 5-star!

We dined here last Friday with a couple of friends. Someone we knew said it was good, so we thought to give it a try. When we walked into the restaurant, the place was dead, only a few customers. It did not look busy, but all of the tables were filthy. No one greeted us or told us if we could sit ourselves or they'd sit us. We finally found a table and waited for a waitress to wipe it off. She brought over some small plates and flatware, from then on, everything went from BAD to WORSE!   - We found a pill on one of the small plates that the waitress brought out. All she said was "Oh, I didn't know how the pill got there?" I jokingly asked "Is it a marijuana pill or some kind of pill that gets me high?" She laughed "possibly!"  - Then my husband found a bug in his drink. A waiter who was not even waiting on us, apologized and brought the drink back to get my husband a new drink. When my husband told our waitress about the bug, she was arguing with him and said "it's a normal thing to see bug everywhere and all the time. Espeically in the summer time, if you leave something out, they are going to attract to sweet and food of course." Not one apology from her.  - My husband asked for the sweet-n-low sugar and she never brough it, but another waitress did. She was busy yapping with others. Then she pretended to bring them over after already knew another waitress had already helped us.  - The owner / partner of the restaurant named John, came by to check on us and asked how we are doing. He looked very depressed. When we shared with him about the pill and the bug, he brushed it off and said "people complaint all the time because they want something free."  We walked out with a bill of $56 for ordering 2 combos (3 tiny tacos on each plate, the rest is filled with lentils and rice), an iced tea, a margarita, a small flan, and suck a@@ service. The food wasn't good and small portions. Their dessert is very aweful. I'm very sure I can get better service and quality meals at El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell. They won't be survived for much longer with horrible food, service and attitude.  I 'LL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN. Don't waste your money in this place people, you'll feel sorry.
