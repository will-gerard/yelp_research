I will be back, it had some fantastically great deals. I wanted to buy so much that I had no plans to use. Just to own. OK there were two downsides as far as I could tell. 1. There was no information posted about how the store worked. It sounds silly if you haven't been there. My friend and I were trying to figure out how to hold onto all the bolts we wanted yards of as there were no carts. The answer is you bring it up front and have them cut it for you and they keep it in a bag for you behind the counter until you are ready to check out. You can do this as many times as you like.  2. The salespeople I dealt with were very vague and did not seem as if they had been hired from the best or the brightest. I had to rephrase my questions about how the store worked 4 times before they said something that answered my questions. Once those two things were dealt with I had a great time being overwhelmed by too many choices. TOO MANY CHOICES!

I don't know if there are words for how much fun this place is, so I'll just give a quick rundown of the evening of awesome. We had to park in the bottom of the hill parking lot but they have a shuttle that we didn't take. Take the shuttle if you aren't wearing sneakers.  We showed up (6 of us) around 7 and were told it would be an hour wait.  After 15 minutes they had a booth for us. We walked past the live cow and got to take the slide downstairs. The hostess waited for us at the bottom of the slide. It was a booth that fit all 6 of us easily and we are not little petite people. The only drinks on the specialty menu had tequila but the das boote was recommended as a particularly girly drink. It is supposed to taste like melon but it tasted like Jello and came out on fire and you get to keep the boot glass! We ordered rattlesnake as an appetizer and it tasted like fried whitefish. It came with the snake's spine? 4 of us ordered the Cowboy Stuff where you get everything for $22. Then the balloon man Frank came to the table. Even though we were all adults he made us balloon animals. He was fantastic! I got a giraffe with a different colored mane. My friends and BF got a T-rex, a monkey with banana and a motorcycle. I went outside to get a close up of the views and by the time I got back  our table was filled up with cowboy stuff. The sauce on the meat was delicious and the seafood was well cooked as in tasty. The potatoes made me feel as if I had died and gone to carb heaven. The beans were bland and the pineapple coleslaw disturbing but if that's the worst I can say about a place is that two of their sides weren't my favorite then I think it's all right. My friends that didn't order cowboy stuff got ribs. Deliciously tangy sauce with a little bit of heat. I was originally terrified by the idea of their live band as usually those are so loud you can't hold a conversation but they had their own section and rocked out. There were a lot of kids around but none I would consider obnoxious. They seemed to burn off their over-stimulation riding down the slide and going up the stairs again. Our server was incredibly fast and somehow managed to see our drink glasses  through all of the stuff on the table and keep them filled. Basically it was fun enough we plan to come back within a month to celebrate a friend's birthday with a giant hat and an eclair the size of her head. Well worth it and the views from our table were incredible.

Ruth Sells made a long uncomfortable process so much easier than it could have been. Last August against Ruth's suggestion, she said it would take forever, we put a bid on a short sale. The following months were an exercise in frustration as the seller's bank fired processor after processor. They were on their fifth one by the time it was approved so it took almost 9 months. She kept after the seller's agent for information and updated me almost weekly, even when there was nothing new to report, just so I would know what was going on.  When we decided after 8 months that we wanted to look at other houses she sent us a list of houses in our specific wants needs price range. All through the process she has been fantastic and I can't recommend her enough.

If I could score less than a star I would. It was not so much the location as the company that has so horrible. The lady at the counter was friendly though it took us 55 minutes to rent a car as we didn't have a reservation and apparently that blows their minds away.  We had been renting as our car was in the shop. The car ended up taking longer than planned, so we called about pricing an extension on a Friday around 1 pm. They put an unauthorized hold on another 250 dollars. They had no recourse for us and told us that billing would be able to clear it up Monday. Or if we returned the car it would be posted back. Repeatedly we were blown off and unnecessarily transferred and put on 20 minute plus holds. This does not convey the lack of concern that the representatives had for us but I do understand why they have an F with the better business bureau now.

I had read the reviews and wasn't worried about cleanliness as excessive attention to our health was the cause for several lower reviews. I was concerned that I would be tense as there was mention of a less than friendly attitude.  Luckily I saw nothing of that. I called the day before I got pierced to see what prices would be. I was getting second holes in my ears plus cartilage top of ear. I was given the prices and a bunch of make sure you eat first and the person at the other end was friendly. When we showed up, the receptionist was incredibly friendly and answered all of our off topic gauge questions as well as overloading me with information that she handed to me in paper form as well. While we waited she showed us her favorite jewelry. My piercer was Jeremiah and he was fantastic. He made jokes through the entire ordeal. Some of them were even funny. Not once did I get the look or or expression of you are not cool enough to get pierced that I have gotten other places. If you use their bathroom, the light is a motion detector so don't stand in the doorway and try to feel for a switch on the wall. You won't find it and the light won't go on. That was the most uncomfortable awkward part of the entire trip for me.

The food was ten star. The service was so bad I would have felt justified in not leaving a tip. I'm not sure why it was so bad, maybe because we were the only non Asian people in the place. There are not words for how poor the service was, but so so yummy. I will most likely go back. we have since gone back for dim sum. The food was tasty still though a bit heavy on the shell fish options. The service was miles above the previous time, which is why the stars went up.

I have since gone back with a crowd of friends for dim sum. It was very tasty and they weren't bothered in the least that all through out our meal we kept having more people show up.We started with one table and by the end, we were squeezed into three. The service was much better and friendlier this time around.

We got a house. That's very exciting and very expensive. These guys were fantastic. They called me an hour before their appointment to let me know they were still coming. They were worried they would be late as I lived further away than they had thought. They still got there ten minutes early. I explained what had been on the inspector's report and they let me know that an item listed on the report was fine, just not up to code. They showed us how to use the water softener as I had never had one before. They verified the weird contraption on a toilet was a bidet with high water pressure. (also exciting) They started taking apart the sinks as my boyfriend went to home depot to get the new faucets it turned out we needed. They advised on brand, to make sure we got the one with the awesome warranty. They answered his calls from the store and even spoke with a floor rep to make sure he got the right things. They installed them and were gone. They were friendly and gave great advice on different ways to save money. Some having nothing to do plumbing at all. We have their sticker on our water heater tank to make sure we know who to call whenever we need plumbing done again.  Also the guys I had over believe strongly in "what goes around comes around" and so have honest business dealings out of self interest. They were around $175 less then we had planned on. Gush Gush Gush awesomeness.

TKS handyman. He may indeed be the courteous handymen of some reviewers' dreams but unfortunately I did not have that experience. I called him but could not leave a message as his voice mail was full. I saw that several reviewers mentioned texts so I texted him. I let him know that his voice mail was full and that I was looking for a dry waller. I understood it was a late Friday afternoon so wasn't expecting a quick response. 3 hours later though I got one. It was polite and asked if he could call me the next day. He didn't though. Nor the day after that. Nor Monday. I tried calling him Monday but his voice mail was still full. I sent a text letting him know I would go elsewhere as he appeared to be busy. I hope he is ok as it just occurred to me he may have been injured on a job. The reason I am bothering to review is that he did initially respond. If he hadn't I would have consigned him to the meh file but the promised call back never materializing was more disappointing then never receiving a response would have been.

Delicious. We first stopped here and I was terrified as i hate salad places usually. I've tried all of their paninis now and love them. The one with gouda cheese is a little heavy on the gouda, which I never thought I would hear myself say. The ginger dressing they add to their side salad is delicious. I go and have to make myself try something besides the Seared Tuna.

This is an independently owned USED bookstore. The people that work there are friendly and the ones that I've dealt with are knowledgeable about sci fi, fantasy and cheesy romance novels. The prices are pretty decent though the organization is erratic. They have four square deals and twitter junk It's a decent place and should be visited at least 7 times.

They are amazing. We hadn't done anything in our back yard for almost two years. We hate yard work. The patio is attached to our back door but we could no longer reach our patio grill safely. There were multiple weeds that were over 6 feet tall. There was a dense undergrowth of 2 feet on average. It was overwhelming just to look at it. They came over to do an estimate, had it emailed to me the next day and were scheduled by the day after that. They charged half of the price of a previous yard clean up, and did a better job more quickly. And I had liked the last company's results, they had just been busy. You can schedule everything online and everyone is friendly.
