We went here on a Friday night.  I had heard about El Zocalo for a long time but never went in.  I knew they had a great patio so when we decided to try it and were told we could be seated immediately on the patio, we went for it.  It was around 6:30PM and they had fans outside blowing mist so it helped with the heat a bit.  The outdoor patio/courtyard is a great atmosphere.  As it gets dark it really looks very cool.  Freddie Duran played his guitar and sang.  He did a mixture of some Eagles, Steely Dan, Van Morrison, etc... as well as some songs in Spanish.  He took requests too.  There were some young girls who walked around offering samples of margaritas and other types of drinks.  The waiter was fine...nothing special but no complaints. We only ordered appetizers because we weren't that hungry and didn't want to spend a ton of money.  We had the stuffed quesadilla (shredded beef) and the bean dip.  Honestly the food didn't blow us away but it was fair enough and I felt the overall experience was pretty good.  The chips and salsa were really good.  I definitely plan on going back soon- not necessarily for the food but for the overall experience.

My husband and I ate here tonight.  We wanted some place local and he was in the mood for Mexican.  We used to come here fairly regularly but it has been several years since the last time we came.  It looks beautiful outside, they added a covering t the patio and it looks like they painted and spruced up the place.  The inside is nothing special but definitely good enough.  We waited less than 5 minutes to be seated.  We had a good server.  The chips and bean dip are really good.  The food was good too.  It was good enough for my taste.. I am not a gourmet restaurant reviewer so it was fine by my standards.  Since we were out without our kids tonight we were really enjoying just sitting and chatting.  However, we didn't want to linger so after we paid the check we sat outside in the courtyard area under the trees on a bench swing.  It was beautiful and quiet.  Overall, I like this place and would go back again.

The Coco is my favorite! Pure coconut- not too sweet, very refreshing! Definitely a great compliment to the other businesses in the area.

This place gets super busy!! But, I can see why... it was good food in a great Mill Ave location. Everything on the menu sounded good and everything I saw on other tables looked great.  If you go, just be prepared to wait in a line and scope out a table!

Went to Barrio Queen for lunch today.  I live in Chandler and was meeting a friend from Cave Creek so we wanted to meet somewhere in the middle.  I got a lot of recommendations to try this place and read the reviews on Yelp.  It sounded great!  Parking was easy... it was a Saturday afternoon but the underground garage had plenty of spaces and it's free.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to sit outside.  It is unseasonably warm right now and unfortunately our table had a lot of sun so it was kind of hot!  But, it was a nice patio and I liked the overall feel of the place.  Our server took our drink order and I think she brought me a Coke Zero instead of Diet Coke.  After she came back I told her I didn't think it was a Diet Coke so she brought me a new drink which was correct...however it took a while for her to come back with it.  The food was ok.  A little pricier than I would have liked for what you actually get but I guess that's Scottsdale.  I had the Carne Asada torta that came with fries.  The fries were steak fry style (which I am not a fan of) and they had some kind of seasoning on them that I didn't care for.  The sandwich was actually very good but nothing I would go back for.  My friend had a salad -Aguacate Tomato Mango.  It was more like a plate of wedges of Avocado, Tomato, and mango...no lettuce or anything.  It looked good if you are into that but it wouldn't have been enough of a satisfying meal for me.  My bill with tip came to just under $20 and in my opinion, that was more than I thought it was worth.  It wasn't horrible and I would give it 2 1/2 stars but Yelp doesn't let you...so "Meh, I've experienced better" would perfectly sum it up.  I think I would have given it a better review if we sat in the shaded part of the patio and if I had ordered the 3 tacos for $10 plate...the tacos are supposed to be good.

Loved the patio! Went at about 6:30 for dinner. Perfect timing as it was still light out but the sun was going down and the atmosphere was very cool.  Started to get busy after we sat down.  My favorite thing about this place was the location, the patio, the atmosphere.  We ordered the fried mushroom appetizer which isn't on the regular menu.  It was a special for football.  Unfortunately, it was rather tasteless.  It came with ranch to dip it in and that is the only part of the dish that had any flavor.  The mushrooms were very bready and soo hot inside that the juice burned my tongue!!  For our meal we decided on the Beer Mac n Cheese and the Fish and Chips.  We told them we were going to split them and they were nice enough to split it for us and bring us each our own serving of both dishes!  Nice touch!!  The Mac n' cheese was Awesome!!! So flavorful and delicious.  However, I am glad we split it because a full serving would have been too much... it was very rich and by my last forkful, I started get tired of it.  The fish and chips were not good.  The batter was the same batter they used for the fried mushrooms.  It had no flavor.  The fish itself was also pretty tasteless.  The chips were ok....thinly sliced potatoes that weren't that hot.   The service was fine.  Nothing out of the ordinary but no complaints whatsoever on that front.   All that being said, I would definitely go back!!  I think I would get a burger next time...I read they won an award for their burgers and their patio!!  Even though our food choices left us dissatisfied, I know that there is something better on the menu for the next time.

Ok, really would give it more than 2 stars but not quite 3.  Went with my family and they all liked it fine.  I guess I am just a little picky.  We are happy that something finally opened up in this space.  Most of the customers are probably Sun Lakers...we were one of only 2 young'ish families there.  The decor was a bit blah... To be honest it reminded me of a place that Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible would be walking into for the "before" status.  It was clean, though.  For a Saturday afternoon lunch time, there was barely a crowd.  There was plenty of staff that didn't seem to have much to do...  The staff was friendly.  The service was fine.  I ordered a French Dip and onion rings.  It wasn't awful but it definitely wasn't the best I have ever had.  It was fine.. I ate it all.  Husband and daughter #1 had a burger.  They liked.  Daughter #2 had a BLT...she liked. They have a special going on where if you spend $30 you get a free pie.  We took home a peanut butter cup pie.  It was good..but again- nothing that I HAVE to go back for.  The lunch for 4 (only 2 of us ordered a soft drink) with tip came to around $40.  Not bad considering we got a free pie that is normally around $12.  So, overall it was just OK...

After giving this place several tries, I have decided that I will not be going back any time soon.  Last night I went with some friends for Happy Hour.  I ordered off the regular menu because the HH food menu is quite limited.  I ordered the chicken finger basket with onion rings.  The chicken was good but I didn't care for the breading they use.  The onion rings were cold and gross.  The waitress brought me a fresher batch and they were ok.  But, I couldn't even eat them, everything was so greasy that I started to feel sick.  I never not eat my meal and this was a first for me.  My overall impression of that place as of now is "yuk". I like the outside patio...that is the best part about the place although last night a woman came to the patio with a sign asking for money or food.  That was sad and not something I am used to seeing in this part of Chandler. Sorry, Zipps...please try harder.

Went here tonight for a casual night out with my husband.  We wanted to go early before it got crowded.  We got there around 5:30 and went to the bar upstairs.  There was a good amount of people up there yet there was still several open places to sit.  Upstairs it is seat yourself.  I had been reading the reviews on here and saw a few that gave bad reviews for poor service so I was nervous.  However, we were greeted in a fair amount of time and placed our drink order.   I wanted a beer and am not adventurous with beer so I ordered a Bud Light.  I wasn't asked if I wanted it on tap or in a can.  I assumed it would come in a glass.  However I was delivered a can.  Kind of different but it was fine with me.  My husband ordered a peach iced tea.  It was sweetened and he felt it was too sweet, though.  The menu was interesting.  There were a lot of items that did not appeal to me but a few that did and the prices seemed very reasonable.  I ordered the spinach artichoke grilled cheese sandwich that comes with tater tots.  He ordered the  beer sausage pizza.  I enjoyed the sandwich very much.  He liked the pizza fine but didn't think it was anything special.  Our server was very very low key, not much of a personality but he did the job and I don't have any complaints regarding service.  As the sun went down it started to get much busier.  It's definitely a hotspot for young-middle age crowd.  Not really a young crowd but that may change as the evening goes on.  We left by 6:30.  We enjoyed hanging out and enjoying the atmosphere.  It is a cool place.  Downstairs looked nice too and would be a fun place to go with the kids.  The birds were fun to watch down there.  My only complaint for the night was that people are allowed to smoke up there so every once in a while we got a whiff of the smoke.  It wasn't that bad...could have been worse.   There was music playing and we were right by the speakers.  It was the perfect level...loud that it drowned out the other conversations but not too loud that we  couldn't hear each other. I would definitely go back... it is a cool atmosphere and would be fun to go to with a group or girls night out.
