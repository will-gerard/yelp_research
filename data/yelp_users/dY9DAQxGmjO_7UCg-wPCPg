Had a great happy hour at the Drummer recently.  Haven't been since we moved back to AZ three years ago, and never to this location.  The wings we had grilled, they were the best ever.  Crispy and perfect, I don't like over sauced wings.  The burger were just as I remembered, cooked in wine, not such a massive burger, just the right size for me.  Decent beer selection though this is not a craft beer hangout.  We will be back soon!

OMG I wish we had gone here a long time ago.  This is an Italian restaurant/sports bar combo that fires on all cylinders.  Service, menu selection, food quality and quantity...all top notch.  The burger sliders were to die for, along with the sweet potato fries.  How many sports bars offer sweet potato fries???    Can't wait to return and try the pizza or calzone....

We tried Pinky's for the first time this past week.  While the food was pretty good (better than average), it was the small town feel, the friendliness of the staff, and the old-time decor that drew us in.  It reminded me of a cafe that I worked at in high school.  I ordered the green chile-cheese omelette which was yummy!  The home fries weren't really hot but were tasty just the same.  My husband had the 2 egg-short stack of pancakes, and bacon breakfast.  The pancakes were HUGE...though again not as hot as they should have been.  They wouldn't melt the butter...but they were pretty good just the same.  Scrambled eggs were done perfectly and the bacon was thick and crispy.  Coffee cups were constantly topped off.  We will be back!

I have been eating at Los Olivos since 1987.  It is the ONLY place I think of when I am hungry for Mexican food.  The Corral family has kept this one in the family, and they still make the fresh tortillas and guacamole daily.  Order the chicken chimi supreme, it's not on the menu but it's always a known by your waiter...huge chimi done enchilada style with heaps of guac and sour cream on top.  The margaritas are fab, if you want a splurge go for the Cadillac.  Mmmmm.    This one is a must eat every time I am in town.

Our favorite dive Chinese restaurant.  Whenever we are back in Phx we go here.  Why?  1.  The best crab puffs on the planet 2.  The best fried rice that we have ever had! 3.  Sweet and sour sauce that they make on site, SOOO good. 4.  Never had anything that wasn't really good, really hot, and portions are extremely generous.  Can I transport this place back to Jacksonville???  We are sorely in need of decent Chinese food.

First some of my background....20+ years as a waitress, hostess, catering captain, catering business owner.    We arrived at 5 pm on 12/31.  The first words out of the hostess/owner's mouth were "do you have a reservation?"  Not a good sign.  I snuck a peek at the reservation book, and there were a handful before 6 pm but no more.  I said that no, we thought we were safe coming in at 5.  She gave us the stink-eye and  proceeded to make a big deal about "finding" a table.  This while there were maybe 2 tables occupied in the whole place.  We should have taken the opportunity to say "thank you very much" and turned around and walked away, but we did not...having been wanting to try this place for a long time.  We sat and were waited on by the hostess herself.  Cordial enough, but no offering of a wine list or anything.  Clearly getting the bum's rush from the beginning.  We opted for a glass each of the house wine since no other options were given (generally we would order a bottle).  The wine was horrible, watered down and flavorless.  We ordered prime rib (Traditional cut) for $22 each.  Salad bar was small but good and fresh.  Meals were timed quickly after the salad was cleared.  Prime rib was decent, mine was not medium rare but more medium, barely room temp.  I had the steamed veggies which were done fine...husband had baked potato.  We were quickly offered coffee which we refused...at this point we couldn't get out of there quickly enough.    While the food was decent and the prices were reasonable, it was the initial treatment and the feeling of needing to free up the table that will keep us from ever returning.  Next time we will stay and have dinner at Dick's Hideaway where we had cocktails before venturing into Feeney's.

Second Home...we call it 2H....has been a lifesaver for us with our little Jack Russell.  She has had a hard time with house training and separation anxiety since we lost our other JR who was 16.  She is SO excited to go to see her friends every day and her energy level is very manageable in the evenings since she gets so much exercise.  Gidget loves it there!

This amazing gem in my neighborhood never disappoints.  The new menu is awesome!  We had to do the cheese curds, always a favorite...and the new pigs in a blanket with Schreiner's sausage.  OMG.  Entrees - I often gravitate back to the chicken and waffles.  SO good.  Hubs had the BBQ ribs and he cleaned his plate!  The four of us had two bottles of Simple Life Pinot Noir, another standby.  Little cookie dough bites still there for a sweet treat since we had no room for dessert....though they sounded heavenly!  Love that we can make reservations now.  Thanks John and crew for another great meal!!

Shrimp rolls were our fave...crispy and flavorful with a pineapple dipping sauce.  Painkillers were great, as was the Dr. Funk and the Dark and Stormy.  We will be back soon!

Two new favorites and my go to breakfast from now on...Breakfast bowl with turkey, spinach, egg white, secret sauce, and other yummy stuff!  Low carb!!  For those of you who need bread, the breakfast sandwiches are amazing as well!!  For coffee, the cold brew is smooth as advertised, and perfect over ice for the summer.  You gotta try this place!  Bonus, it's 2 1/2 blocks from my house and the owners are also neighbors!
