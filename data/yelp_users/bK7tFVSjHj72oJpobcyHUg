I am not sure who labeled Dick's Tex-Mex, they are WAY off.  It is New Mexican for sure, and AMAZING for certain things and ok for others and not so great for some things.  The atmosphere is fun, quirky and all Dick's!  Wood floors, cozy tables, cool wood bar, fully testosterone driven decor with some Kokopellis  and Coyotes thrown in for good measure.  Dark, smokey (the good kind wafting up from the smoker and the hot hardwood coals on the grill), comfortable and casual.  John Wayne would have felt quite at home here. The wait staff has always been awesome.  In the 12-15 year that I have been going to Dick's I have only had one bad experience with a member of the waitstaff, luckily they are gone now.  The food is great in very specific areas, like the Carne Adovada, Blue Corn Smoked Turkey Enchiladas and Posole which are exceptional.  Smokey, spicy, tender and savory.  Sunday brunch with a plate of Carne Adovada and an over easy egg will make your entire year!  The quesadilla is solid, the hamburger is wonderful, the grilled shrimp and smoked foods rock!  When they stick to the New Mexican cuisine the food is heartwarmingly great.  When they stray... sometimes it works and most of the time it doesn't.  I usually steer away from the fish specials which usually are over breaded, over cooked, over sauced and unfortunate when it is all said and done. I also stay away from the salads which are over worked and heavy.  The wine and beer selection are unexpectedly good for a neighborhood bar setting, but I usually go for the Prickly Pear Margarita!  Needless to say I weigh just under 200 lbs at 6 foot and two are sufficient to make me slur my words a touch, well, more than a touch (even with a full belly of Carne Adovada).  But it I enjoy every minute of the food, atmosphere, drinks and camaraderie at Dick's Hideaway!

We went to Hana again and were rewarded with yet another wonderful experience!  We went for a birthday party and had about 8 people.  I love that when you walk in they yell out the traditional greeting.  It reminds me of Monsters Inc at Harry Hausens...  I know a kid at heart.  I enjoy being able to bring my own wine, sake or beer.  We ordered the pot stickers and the fired tofu as apps and I love their pot stickers.  It was a first for the fried tofu which was quite good.  Kind of like fried cheese... mmmmm.  There were a few uni shooters with some very pleased pallets and a few quail eggs shooters with the same happy taste buds around the table.  Mike had the Ebiyakisoba (shrimp noodles, I can't spell it to save my soul) which are tasty! There was a steak at the table and it was quite good.  And then the sushi!  We ordered the chefs choice $80 platter of sashimi then about the same amount in rolls.  The salmon was rich and buttery, the tuna succulent, the striped bass was excellent, I didn't get any of the scallops but everyone said they were great!  For the rolls we had the dragon roll, the shrimp tempura roll and I can't remember the last two rolls because the champagne and wine had started to take effect. All were wonderful!  One the downside the space REALLY needs an update... it has been a few years and the Ikea touches need to go.    I know in most Asian restaurants the food comes out when it comes out.  Meaning the hot dishes come out first, or your apps come out last and Hana is no different.  Unfortunately the waiter who used to get it and would put the orders in timing them so everything would actually show up when it was supposed to is now gone.  He is the cute Rock'a Billy dark haired gentleman over at Windsor. He will be missed if only because he understood and was proactive in making the experience great.  But knowing this is just how it is and expecting in advance helps.  Overall a great experience.  For 8 people the food and tip were right about $220 not bad for really good sushi!  It is a must if you like or love sushi!

We needed coffee beans and headed down to Lola's.  We noticed Centurion and decided to try it.   We got to sit at the "Chef's Table" which is just the table next to the postage stamp sized kitchen.  Chef Eric was fun to watch and talk to while he worked his magic.    Cole was knowledgeable about the menu and wine.  While he wasn't quite as sophisticated as the menu he made up for it with his engaging and eager to please attitude.  The rest of the staff were all smiling and focused on making our experience a great one.  We had 5 of the tapas - the Risotto of the Day, Papas Bravas, Pancetta Wrapped Gnocchi, Chef Eric's Bolognese.  And for dessert we had the flourless chocolate tort - I mean the decedent chocolate creation that I will crave for a long time or until we need coffee beans again.  This is a must try restaurant!

First, I love Cafe Barrio.  The experience has always been top notch.  Unfortunately Barrio Queen completely missed the mark.  I didn't want to like it, I wanted to love it!  Wet arrived about 7 last Friday night.  My partner was very excited because he loves CB.  I liked the interior, it was fun, playful and half-hazzard like CB.  Mike didn't like it, he thought they were trying to hard.  Our friends from Denver liked the interior well enough.  The experience... the waiters, servers, staff all looked busy, looked is the operative word.  The restaurant was less than half full and the staff looked harried and rushed.  When we got to our seats on the patio we all thought what a great night, beautiful weather, fun exciting place and we know the food is good at CB so it should be great here.  We playfully talked to our waiter... which I guess was the wrong thing to do.  Our friends love to laugh and flirt and push boundaries, our waiter was short, abrupt and acted offended.  I reminded him that he was working for tips, then he conveniently remembered he is/was in the service industry.  We had to ask for water repeatedly, and finally our waiter said "I told the buss boy to get you water..."   Unfortunately this sums up the waiter experience.  The bus boys were standing at the end of the bar talking... all night... which explains why we waited for thirty minutes to get water.  We ordered the choriqueso and the guacamole for appetizers.  When it came out the choriqueso was a monster bowl of cheese with some spicy sausage which was tasty if a bit overwhelmingly large.  The guacamole was surprising, it came in a very small bowl.  Usually at CB they come to the table and make the guac table side with flourish and panache.  Then I noticed that two tables were there the quac was being made table side... I looked at the tables to see what the difference was and it was glaringly obvious.  Not one of the four of us had boobs.  Then I looked at all of the staff, excluding the two women at the front desk who were wonderful by the way everyone else was male.  The servers went out of their way to make the quac for the tables with ladies but the tables with men we got a quarter order of guac made in the kitchen... reverse discrimination or homophobia... either option sucks.  Unfortunately it didn't stop with the guac...  For dinner Mike ordered the enchiladas de pollo.  I ordered off the "sushi" taco sheet the cochnita pibil tacos (great idea, love the concept). Our friends from Denver split the 16 de septiembre chiles rellenos.  Mike was disappointed by his enchiladas, they were not very flavorful and the plate looked like a Chopped Chef threw everything on the plate just to be done in time.  My tacos were as expected, similar to CB good flavor but the same IronChopped Chef ran out of time on my plate.  The chiles rellenos were the highlight, the chef took time to make sure it looked great.  The boys from Denver loved it.  Dessert... the same chef who ran out of time plating Mike's and my plates also ran out of time and I think some ingredients for the churros.  At CB they finish the plate with some ice-cream which (I know it sounds funny) cuts the sweetness of the caramel.  It was sorely missed.    Unfortunately when we left Mike and I said to each other that the food and the experience was not worth the drive or money (we live by the Biltmore) and if we wanted the food CB was a better bet.  It is a shame really, it is a great space, in a really nice area but it misses the mark by quite a bit.  Our bill was just over 120 for the four of us.  Yes I had two margaritas which were good but 120 plus tip?  Two apps, three entrees and two desserts... 120 plus tip for Mexican food?  CB is worth it BQ... not so much.    I truly hope they can get the staff trained to be as professional and friendly as CB to all patrons not just those with boobs.  Yes, Phoenix is more diverse than Scottsdale but great service should extend to all patrons regardless of mammary  glands.  I also hope they can get the kitchen staff to take time, slow down and make the food look great (especially when the restaurant is only half full).  The flavors are mostly there, the plating enhances the experience and visually adds to the food.

Flashy Style over Substance... It is a shame.  We have been wanting to try Steak 44 for a while, we heard great things - REALLY  great things so were excited when the opportunity presented itself to finally go.  We arrived and were greeted by Lamborghini's, Audi R8s and a few S550's.  Walking in the place is LOUD, the kind of loud that makes you yell at your party to talk and leaves you with a sore throat the next day loud.   The staff - FANTASTIC!  From the greeter/hostess to the waiters and waitresses - they were excellent, from start to finish excellent.  Professional, accommodating, friendly and very helpful.  The space - Very Vegas - not necessarily in the best way.  Some beautiful woods, high-end finishes, but Vegas nun the less.  The atmosphere - Lots, and lots of working girls - I love skin but YIKES - being gay I do not want to be someones gynecologist while dining at a fine restaurant.  "Russian Talent" was slurred from the table behind us.  Hot pants, tube tops and KMDFMP's are/should not be acceptable dining attire for a restaurant of this perceived quality. There were quite a few professional football players with some coaches and agents.  Lots and lots of plastic surgery - enough that any of the Real House Wives of Beverly Hills would have said "Wow, she is WAY over done... I need to go there."   Food - Meh... I had an unmemorable salad, the prawns were way overcooked and rubbery.  The oysters were really nice and fresh with freshly grated horseradish and nice sauces.  Then... a horrible bone in tenderloin filet.  Supposedly this was a prime cut of beef, but it was neither prime nor tender - I really should have said something then but was so disappointed and starving I just ate it.  No salt and pepper on the steak, the baked potatoes (yes two, assuming they only got small potatoes in so had to make due) looked like they had been sitting out for a week or two and half-heartedly reheated. To be fair all of the other steaks were good to excellent.  But the lobster mash was greasy (not butter greasy) and didn't have salt and pepper.  The highlight was the butter cake with hot strawberry sauce.  Drinks - Really nice wine selection if a bit to heavy on the overrated flashy wines.   The martinis were excellent and good beer choices.  If I could rate the staff they would get 5 stars - unfortunately the food was so hit and miss that I couldn't give it more than 2 stars.

First let me say I am a fan of Spanish Tapas! Second let me say I was a HUGE fan of Lola's Tapas in the old location on Camelback.  Lola's was always loud, always chaotic, always fun and always expensive.  But the energy, the Spanish wine, excellent Tapas and quirky vibe was well worth it and made for a great night out!  Parking = nightmare as it is every time you go to the Yard.  The space is FAN-EFFING-TASTIC!  All of the coffee accoutrement is exciting!  We loved the atmosphere, the finishes, and the tremendous energy of all the people playing Ping-Pong, and all of the games out in the yard.  However... there were only three tables with people, including us.  So the vibe was off with the disparity between the two worlds.   The staff was nice, not very up on the menu and a bit inconvenienced by us and/or they were so new they didn't realize that customers are a good thing?  I still can't decide...   After we ordered Walter came by and introduced himself.  I found out a few days later he is one of the owners.     I have to say I was put off by several of the things he was telling us.    1. They haven't started advertising.  Explains the customer situation - almost a month after opening.  2. They are getting rid of the Spanish wines in favor of California wines.    I asked " Are you trying to make the wine more approachable?" to which he fumbled a halfhearted yes.  My instinct is that maybe Walter does not like or understand Spanish wine and does like California wine.  Maybe it is just me... but if you take away the second most important thing about a Tapas bar - the Spanish wine - you can't expect to survive as a Spanish Tapas Bar for very long.  I suggested he add a few more Cava to the menu - I don't think my suggestion went far based on his lack of enthusiasm as the conversation shifted to:   3. They are changing the menu and removing some of the Tapas and adding Paella.    Now... I LOVE Paella.  Between my friends and I we have two or three 36-48 inch Paella pans with the grills to cooks them with and a half dozen of the smaller Paella pans. Walter was kind enough to wait while I searched for an old picture of me cooking a 48 inch Paella - so it was off putting when Walter asked me what my favorite Paella was and I told him rabbit and he stood there with his mouth agape.  He said they were going to have vegetable, chicken or seafood Paella. Ok.    Just a suggestion but has to be REALLY good - because mediocre Paella is horrible.  Not that it can't work or be a great addition, but had better be really, really good.  Now to the food:  We ordered the Shrimp, the Steak, the Jamon and Cheese tray and a glass of the one and only Cava.    The Cava was good, ok quality = B-  The Jamon and Cheese tray - had some lovely dates, Jamon was nice but cold like it just came out of the refrigerator instead of being hand sliced at room temp.  The Cheese was ok and the Marcona almonds were fine = C  The Steak arrived on a regular plate - not the traditional Tapas clay dish.  The steak was thin, of poor quality, overcooked and luke-warm.  The plate was cold and hence why the steak was not hot.  The steak didn't have the cumin like at the old Lola's - instead it came with a blue cheese crumble on top, needed salt and pepper = D  The Shrimp also arrived on a regular plate that wasn't heated.  The first few were great, reminiscent of the old Lola's flavor and pizzazz.  Then, because the plate was so cold the shrimp cooled quickly and lost their pizzazz.  Started out as an A and quickly cooled/congealed to a C  I sat there basking in the romantic wine soaked memories of the old Lola's - all of the chaotic energy, bumping into people, yelling over the music, laughing, spilling wine on someone and buying them a new glass as an apology, reaching for that last olive, anxiously waiving down the rushing waiters furiously trying to keep up with the second or fourth round of orders of the shrimp and wine, striking up conversation with the people next to you...  With this excellent space, all of the new coffee equipment, all of the frenetic energy of the Yard Lola's Tapas should be a huge hit.  I sat there willing it to be better, to match the quality of the space, the quality of the coffee equipment the quality of my memories.  I truly hope they don't get rid of the Spanish wine or Tapas.  I hope that they go full Spanish traditional with the clay tapas pots piping hot (just a suggestion).  I hope they add more Tapas like the Croquets con Papas y Jamon, Roast Suckling Pig, Spanish honey with Manchego or Mussels with Cava and Chorizo, Fideos with Chorizo.  I hope they add more Cava, and/or more... dare I say it... Spanish wine.  We will give the time.  The Lola's of old deserves the chance to be reborn in this amazing space.

We have been wanting to go to Southern Rail for a while but we like to give a restaurant time to get on it's feet so to speak.  It has been open for a while now so we made reservations for 7:30 - Saturday for 6 of us.  All of us were excited.    We got there and it was painfully apparent we really didn't need a reservation.  We were one of 5-6 tables with between 20-30 open tables (inside and out) - on a Saturday at 7:30.  The people who were there seemed to be enjoying themselves.  The space is fun - if a bit on the Kitsch-y side.  The staff were... good... but they did not seem happy to be there.  No one smiled.  They seemed rushed without reason.    From the food perspective the salads were nice.  But unfortunately that is pretty much the best part of the meal.  I had the pork chop - the pork chop itself was good but the goopy mash of wilted greens and orange glop the pork chop was sitting in was less than appealing.  Our friends had apps for dinner, nothing remarkable nor memorable.  The bill however was remarkable and not in a good way.  It is a shame.  I like Becket's table (which needs a refresh on the menu as it is getting quite stale this far along).  I like Southern food in general.  Unfortunately Southern Rail was just so so and pretty expensive for what it is.
