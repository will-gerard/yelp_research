We've been with Awakening Seed now for a year and half and it was the best option we could possibly get.  Our son, in the Toddler 2s, LOVES his teachers, and we really appreciate the "real" education he gets there  He gets to really be a kid, playing and learning with others.  Awakening Seed feels like family, there is as much focus on learning how to be a good person as how to learn.  Looking forward to our journey at Awakening Seed!

We have been seeing Dianne Olson, N.P. for two years.  Professional, supporting, and answers all questions.  The specialties here are spot on, and they are knowledgeable about what they focus on.

I've been coming here on and off for over 5 years.  Medical staff is fine, but the office staff is horrid.  Referrals take 1-2 months to process, after you come in to the office requesting them a 3rd and 4th time...this has happened to my self and husband... today, the front person forgot to check me in, after waiting an hour and a half...I will try their Scottsdale location for one last shot...

Continue to have great service form Insectek.  Adam Mackey provides great service and is thorough with the inspection and pesticide application and always shows up on time.  Will continue to be an Insecteck customer.
