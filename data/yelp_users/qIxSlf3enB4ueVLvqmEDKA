We came for Lobster Fest and everything was excellent. The losters are two pound and are flown in from Nova Scotia twice a week. Highly recommended, service and food was outstanding.

Food was outstanding! But what made the experience was Amber! She made ordering my lunch fun and entertaining. She recommended the Ruben sandwich and it was the best.

No service, eight people in line no one to wait on you. People leaving because the person working the counter has to help drive through so they can not help the people at the counter.

Food and service was good, place was busy. I had the Cobb salad and it was loaded with bacon, chicken, and cheese. Waitress was always on top of drink orders and servicing our group.

This is the second time I have eaten here and the sandwiches are outstanding! What I like the best is they use ingredients that are fresh but also diffent than what you get at most sandwich places. I have had Zeus on Fire and Mr English sandwich both are excellent,  Mr English is good if you like a little heat. Highly recommend this place, I am a fan!

Sara took care of us at the bar and made the experience over the top, the service and food was outstanding! We had the Manhattan pizza and it was the best pizza ever. It is a true New York Style pizza with fresh toppings. I have lived in Queen Creek for 12 years and this place is the best. If you have not tried the food here you are missing out.
