My wife & I came here for dim sum because our favorite place in Mesa was so overcrowded, & we were hungry. All dim sum items we selected at C-Fu Gourmet were so bland I had to use a lot of soy sauce just to have some flavor.  "Gourmet" should not be part of their name.   I don't plan to go back to this restaurant any time soon.

Monday 11 June 2012, my wife & I had dinner here. We had the beef salad for appetizer. We shared a chicken vegetable stir-fry dish. The spiciness of both dishes were at 4/5. The appetizer was OK. The cook didn't even bother to trim the cabbage leaves of the old wilted parts, which substracted from the experience. The pieces of beef were cut a bit too thick, and they were a bit too salty.   The chicken vegetable stir fry was delicious and tasty. We had to add a bit more dried red pepper to both dishes as we found neither spicy enough.   The best dish was the desert - golden banana, which were 2 pieces of banana and shredded coconut wrapped in rice paper and deep fried. We requested an additional scoop of coconut ice cream for an additional charge. Totally worth it.   We will be back to try other dishes.

I don't understand this place.  The wait was long (40 minutes); lucky of us, the shopping mall distracted us.  I had the spicy cashew chicken over rice.  It was NOT spicy; the chicken was bland (because it was pre-boiled?); the sauce was pure hoisin from a jar. Did the cook put the entire jar of hoisin sauce in this dish, and not other spice? The sauce and the chicken did not go together at all.  My wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap.  It was OK at best. We ended the meal with the warm apple crisp with ice cream. It was way too sweet; spoon for spoon, pure sugar would be less sweet. Only the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream were any good. Oh, one more good thing was the complementary bread and butter served ahead of the meal. The service was average.  So, why is this place so crowded that we had to wait 40 minutes for a table?  The chance I returned to this restaurant is very slim. Not recommended.

Fresh vegetables & fruits at reasonable prices.   My wife and I stop by this place as often as we can whenever we are with reasonable distance.

Had dinner w/ family last night.  Miso soup was very good.  The seaweed salad & the sushi rolls were very fresh & tasty.  Service was very friendly but a bit slow, because there was only 1 waitress.  She was running ragged serving all the tables.  I understand the reason for only 1 waitress.  Helped out by being patient.   Definitely a recommend and will be back.  Will try other dishes next visit. :-)

When we moved to the East Valley in the late 80s, Fiesta Mall was "the cool place" to hang out. Today is the 1st day my wife & I are back in a very long time. We don't even remember the last time we were here last. Fiesta Mall today is a shell of its former self. Many stores are empty. Other shopping malls, such as Chandler Fashion & Tempe Market Place (just to name 2) divert customers away. Also the lack of a major employer (Motorola nearby shut down over 10 years ago) is a major challenge to the recovery of this surrounding area. This fact bounds to affect Fiesta Mall too.   I wish Fiesta Mall, its tenants & its owners well and that their efforts in reviving this place bear fruits soon.

Crêpes are very good. Expensive but delicious. Serving them in plastic to-go boxes cheapens them. Sweet crêpes paired well with black coffee.

Grocery store which presents itself as a farmers' market. But its produce does look "more organic" (whatever that means). My wife definitely prefers this market over the national chain ones.

Our most recent visit to this restaurant was not the first time, obviously.  The food here was still good.  But the service became unprofessional.  This restaurant is open sitting; we came in, selected a table and sat down.  The waitress came to us with menus promptly.  So far so good.  But when we gave our order, she did not write it down.  Even though she repeated the order, we had to remind her one item.  From the moment we sat down to the time we paid at the counter, NO ONE served us water.  None of the waitresses who brought our dishes out, one at a time, noticed there was not a single glass of water.  By the way, I ordered iced tea.  No iced tea.    When I paid at the counter, I informed the manager the short coming of the service of his restaurant.  He asked me to identify the waitress who took our order, but I refused.  My reason: this failure of service started with management, who failed to properly defined responsibilities.  The waitress who took the order might or might not be the same person servicing water.   The other fail point was that no one, especially those who brought the food out afterward, took notice there was no water.  The waitress who originally took our order did not take the time to revisit us and verify that everything was brought out.    Even though the food was good, the service was not.  While I hope management fixes this service problem, I am not sure I will give this place another try, given the bad experience we just had.

We found a crowd for lunch on a Wednesday.  Surprise.  But the wait was not long - about 15 min.  My wife & I shared a banh xeo (pork shrimp crepe) for appetizer.  It was a bit oily for me, but without the oil, the crepe would not be crispy.  My wife had the cold noodle with grilled beef and chicken eggroll (item B4): the grilled beef and the chicken eggroll tasted good but the nouc mam sauce was a bit on the watery side.  I had the bun rieu (shrimp crab noodle soup).  It deserves a solid B grade (I had better & I had worst).  The service overall was prompt and courteous in spite of the crowd.   We'll be back to try other dishes and bowls.

Monday night. On the spur of the moment, my wife & I had dinner at this restaurant. We arrived early enough to beat the crowd. So we were seated & served quickly.   The waiter was very attentive. But he also came across as a bit pushy. He could also be a bit more helpful with recommendations  of dishes at his restaurant. So I deduct half a star.   We had the "dolsot bibimbap" & "gogi bokeum" with chicken. Both dishes are very good. The "dolsot bibimbap" could be a bit more flavorful; I solved this small problem by adding a bit of soy sauce.  So I deduct 1/2 star for this itsy bitsy lack of flavor.  But the rice was so nicely crunchy. Just be careful: the beautiful stone bowl was very hot to the end of dinner.   The chicken "gogi bokeum" was spicy, tasty and delicious. I can't recall any issue with this dish.   When the occasion present itself again, we'll be back at this restaurant. A definite recommend.

My family & I go to Dr. M. Broadbent since we moved to Arizona in the late 80's.  Even though we move 20 miles away, we still go to Dr. M. Broadbent for our dental care needs.  Dr. M. Broadbent and his staff provide great service with excellent results.  Recommend.

Had seafood Pad Thai (medium spiciness) & Thai iced tea.  Pad Thai deserved at least a B+ grade, even though it could be a bit tastier. May it's the nature of seafood, which was very fresh.  Or maybe I should order spicier (8 out of 10 scale) like I usually do, instead of a 5 out of 10.  The portion was big.  I could only finished 1/2.  I had the rest at home for lunch the next day.  When I added more hot sauce, the dish was much better.  The Thai iced tea was right on. Serving staff was very attentive & friendly.   Will be back to try other dishes.  Spicier next time.

Today is our 2nd brunch buffet at this place. Yes, its price is higher than others but the quality is better. Also, we don't get chocked by tobacco smoke walking through the casino. Yes, I can still smell tobacco, but less than other casinos.   The service staff is professional, friendly & efficient.  The seafood is obviously frozen (but what can one expect from a place in the middle of a desert?) but is still better than others.  One of my many favorites is the "custom-cut" bacon: crispy skin, very good flavor.   The dessert dishes are not overly sweet. I can taste the underlying ingredients (nuts, fruits, chocolate, etc.) instead of just sugar.   We will be back to this restaurant.

Stopped by to get couple of sandwiches before the long drive home.  They are good. The bread was crusty and crunchy but not hard; the meat portion was good. Rating = Good.

Typical dim sum served at this restaurant is typical, raging from fair to very good. Most members of the service staff are friendly, a few are efficiency oriented.

This restaurant was about 5 to 6 minutes walk from the court complex in downtown Phoenix. I went here on a lunch break from my interview for jury duty.   While it is small, its corner location affords it a good view of the nearby street intersection. The service is polite, professional & efficient.   A very small side salad with Thai vinaigrette dressing was put on my table, as soon as I sat down, along with the menu. The lunch menu is a single laminated sheet, listing popular dishes & drinks. Once ordered, the lunch dish was brought out quickly.   The Pad Thai with pork I had was pretty typical. Its portion size was just right.   If I am in the vicinity again, I will consider stopping in & trying other dishes.

Automated check-in process good & efficient. Scan the postcard received from the court house at a kiosk & get a badge. The waiting room has self-served coffee & vending machines.   The jury selection process is intended to be more efficient than in past, but it still disrupts your entire day.

The pho here is disappointing. It lacks flavor. It is not savory at all. I can barely taste the star anise, one of the key ingredients of pho. Other flavors were also light or missing. But the bowl does have lots of meat. But quantity does not make up for lack of quality.   The chicken lemongrass is not traditional Vietnamese either. The meat is deep fried instead of stir fried. Even though I can taste the lemongrass, I find the meat hard and dry.   The crispy chicken wings are good although not traditional Vietnamese.   The service is standard Vietnamese/ Oriental: polite, fast & efficient but no smile.

My wife & I stopped by for dinner on a Tuesday night. There was a decent crowd. Unlike other Korean restaurant, this one did not have the overwhelming smell of grease & grilled meat.    We had a spicy tuna kimbap, prime kalbi (beef), spicy chicken w/ lemon, & asparagus. All items were very good. The beef & chicken were grilled at the table. They were nicely seasoned. Right portions for us.   The spicy tuna kimbap was chunks of tuna in mayonnaise laced with sriracha sauce, served over rice balls wrapped in nori, lightly battered and deep fried. It was very tasty.   Pieces of prime kalbi were tender & very good. I preferred them grilled rare. The spicy chicken pieces were well marinated and tasted real good when lightly dipped in lime juice. The asparagus was cooked yet lightly crunchy, the way I liked. Every thing went well with the Sapporo beer on draft.   We finished our meal with banana tempura served with vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream. I wished I ordered a cup of black coffee to go with it.   Our server was professional & friendly. She was running a bit ragged because she had many tables to attend to.   We will definitely return to this restaurant the next time we are in Las Vegas, NV.

Very nice little restaurant.  Good food. Owner / manager is genuinely concerned about our dining experience.  Also he accommodates some special requests (example: my wife likes vegetarian spring rolls which are not on menu, yet he orders his chef to make them for us).  The Banh Xeo, a savory Vietnamese crepe, is light, crispy and delicious.  Bun Bo Hue, a spicy beef pork noodle soup, is also very good.  While the food is very good, the atmosphere and service from the wait staff is basic.  Rating: Recommended.  Opening hours Tue - Thu = 10:00 AM - 8:30 PM Fri - Sun = 10:00 AM - 9:00 PM  Mon = closed

This SLS Hotel Casino is located north of the main Strip, far enough to be isolated from the actions & attractions. The staff at the main desk informed me SLS stands for "Style, Luxury & Services".   Style - None. Our room has no window. The ceiling is left unfinished. Because of these features, the room has the feel of a claustrophobic prison cell. No style.   Walking through the gaming area fails to give me a theme. It has pictures and paintings of chimpanzees dressed as noblemen, women with horse heads, rubber ducky with sun glasses, etc. Maybe I am influenced by the likes of Venetian, Paris Las Vegas, etc. Encore & Wynn casinos have consistent styles of decorations.   Luxury - The head board of our bed is plasticky & cheesy. It looks cheap. The wash sink is behind the head board of the bed. There is no closet, just a frame to hang clothes up. While high prices do not equate to luxury, the decor and furnishings of the windowless room fail to convey luxury.   Service - The staff at the registration desk is professional and friendly. The Wi-Fi is free and has a reasonable speed.   We will only return to this SLS Hotel Casino if not other choice is available.

My wife & Mom came to this store to have 3 rings re-sized.  None of the rings were bought here.  The owner was very gracious and professional.  His work was very good.  And he gave us a good price for his work.  Recommended.

Today's Christmas and this restaurant is open with 3 persons taking care for the sitting area. One appears to be the manager, the other 2 are waitresses. Both waitresses perform their duties in an unhurried manner. The manager is busy with clearing tables and other things. None pay attention to us, even though we call them several times. The people sitting at the next table are down right pissed. After a while, we leave this restaurant taking our business somewhere else.

Yelp user/ friend Doug T. gets the credit for introducing me to this restaurant. I read his review & bookmarked this restaurant.  I took my wife to this place on a Thursday for an early dinner. We were very pleased with the quality of the dishes we ordered and service.  The decor was modern and pleasing.  The appetizer was the grilled beef salad (Yum Nua). The meat was cooked right and well seasoned. The dressing was tasty. But the kitchen staff forgot to add chili peppers. This oversight was confirmed by the manager (owner?) who immediately offered to redo the salad at his expense.  We just requested a side of chili peppers to spice up the dressing, so he didn't have so "suffer a loss".  The oversight was so minor.   The Panang Curry Beef was very good.  Again, meat was cooked just right.  The curry sauce was rich and flavorful.  This dish had the right amount of spiciness we requested.    The 2nd entree was a crispy trout with a mango salad.  The batter of the trout was light.  The mango salad with its dressing complemented the fresh fish very well.    Unlike other Oriental restaurant though, an order of rice cost $1.00.    The service was very pleasant, polite and attentive.  We will definitely return to this restaurant.

17 Jan 16 - Since the original review, my wife & I ate at this restaurant several times.  Each time, we tried one different dish on the menu.  We enjoyed each meal.  The food was always good, flavorful & fresh.  Today, we invited two of our dear friends.  They too were impressed by the flavor and freshness of all dishes we ordered.  Sorry, no picture today; we were too busy enjoying our meal.  This restaurant continues to earn our recommendations.

I think such warning spoke nicely of the owner.   Tonight's dinner was very tasty and enjoyable as usual.   This restaurant continues to earn our recommendations.

Our daughter praised this restaurant many times, so we wanted to try it out.  Last night was our unplanned chance. Since we heard so much about it, I was a bit concerned that I might have unreasonably high expectations. Our experience was generally positive.   The decor of this restaurant is simple. Tables have numbers, with a lamp in Moroccan shade (my assumption) and a condiment box. On the wall are flat screens showing beautiful pictures of Morocco. These pictures truly give a sense of this beautiful North African country. They make me want to visit.  The Zaaluk was somewhat of a letdown, even though it tasted freshly made. My experience with Mediterranean cuisine is very positive. I had Baba Ganoush at a restaurant in the middle of Colorado was very good. Consequently, I was so looking forward to this new appetizer. It lacked flavor. Even with the addition of seasonings, it was still bland. But more food was coming.   The grilled pompano platter was very good. The fish was seasoned and grilled to perfection. Like many cuisines outside of North America, this fish was not de-boned.  Neither my wife or I had problem with removing the fish bones, especially when the fish tasted so good. The side salad with its simple oil & vinegar dressing was fresh and tasty.  The lamb vegetable tagine was very tasty. The lamb was very well seasoned and grilled to order (medium rare for my wife).  This savory dish was beautifully presented in the traditional earthen wear with a conical cover.  The owner and waiter were very attentive, with many visits, yet failed to notice our glasses of water needed to be refillEd.  Yes, we should requested water refills but how hard was it to insure proper refill of water. Our glasses were right out front of our table. Also, the waiter took our order for 2 scoops of gelato, and simply forgot. Servicing other customers distracted him.   When it was time to leave, we were requested to go to the counter near the door and to give our table number. The owner presented what we ordered on a tablet. Payment by credit card included an option for tips.  In spite of some shortcomings, the friendliness of the owner and waiter, and the delicious cuisine earn a recommendation from us.  We will be back to try other dishes.

My wife & I never had Lao cuisine before. So it was with a bit of excitement that we decided to stop by for dinner. We are happy to report it earned our recommendation.   Our waiter was very nice and professional. He was also attentive, yet not intrusive.   The decor of this restaurant is simple, yet elegant. We were so fascinated by the items in the menu, I forgot to photograph the interior.   The Wings with tamarind honey sauce were a finger-linking good dish. The tasty sauce was the right combination of sweetness, tartness and spiciness. It even made the fresh side salad tasted so good. The wings themselves were crispy & well-cooked. The meat was moist.   The Nam is a pleasant surprise. It was a dish made with seasoned minced chicken, tossed in coconut rice and served with fresh green lettuce & mint leaves. I believe the proper way to eat was to use a lettuce leaf to wrap at least a spoonful of chicken rice, and top it with a mint leaf. The combination of flavor and texture of this dish was very good; the round rice cooked in coconut was creamy, yet some part of it was crispy but not hard; the minced chicken was well seasoned. The portion of this dish was a meal in itself, or at least enough to share among 4 people as appetizer.   The Pad-See-Ew with beef tasted slightly different than the traditional Thai version. Some deep-fried noodles were added for contrast with the remaining soft noodles. The meat was well seasoned and tender. But both my wife & I were too full from the other 2 dishes. After a spoonful, we asked to have it boxed up to take home.   The owner came out to greet us toward the end of our meal. She was very nice in describing to us the wonderful cuisine of her native country. At our next visit, we will definitely ask for Lao flavors instead of the "traditional" (Westernized?) ones.   Yes, this restaurant earns our recommendation. We plan to be back to try-out other dishes.
