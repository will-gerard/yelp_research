In a moment of panicked  desperation before a job interview I had my mother cut my hair. I didn't get the job.   It was for reasons that had nothing to do with my hair but there was no denying that my cut was "rough" around the edges. Short on cash and determined to succeed in my next interview,  I made an appointment and was assigned to Aubree. She was warm & cute.  You couldn't help but love her.  But fixing a layered haircut from a woman whose last stylist experience was when I was nine years old was a tall order. One that all the warm and cute in the world could not necessarily fill.   But it didn't take long for me to put all my faith in Aubree because she's a good listener. I told her my sad story and she confidently told me she could fix it. The more time I spent with Aubree the more I got the impression that she is talented at a lot of things.  It seemed like she was in school because she wanted to be - not because she wasn't sure what else to do.    What I liked most about Aubree is that she has the rare gift that only people that are really amazing at something have.  She knows what she doesn't know.  And who to ask so she can learn it.    After Aubree cut my hair, I was happy with it.  But she saw room for improvement and found the best resource to make it perfect!   Talented people are a dime a dozen.  Sadly, most talented people only end up being competent - NOT amazing like one would expect.  Aubree, on the other hand, has the ability to be amazing with her talents. She asked questions and listens to feedback!  This is essential as listening to feedback can be a tricky thing for people who are talented.  Talented people are so good at hearing that they ARE talented that they often translate "not knowing" in a painfully personal way.  They don't hear what the feedback is trying to tell them so they can become better.    But not Aubree!  I have full confidence that the next time I end up with a catastrophic haircut that if I hunt her down in the salon she works in, and if can afford her, that she'll be able to fix me up so I can get the job of my dreams!

I have to admit, my dog HADES is amazing!!!!  I don't know how I ended up with a rescue dog that is so well behaved!!!  She has traveled with me all over the USA AND to 3 countries by car, train, boat and plane!   She is my best friend - I take her EVERYWHERE!!!  She would follow me to the end of the earth and back.  But....without a leash!!!  On a leash, it was  the complete opposite.  When I put my dog on a leash, everything would descend into the depths of chaos!!!!   She would pull me in every inconceivable direction, take cheap shots at every dog she encountered and seemed like she was going to choke herself into an early death.    Aside from the danger of it all, it was just plain embarrassing!    People are always asking me for DOG advice but yet I had a dog that, on leash, couldn't even take a stroll around the block without a complete "scene" taking place.    So I took a chance and decided to "invest" in a private lesson at Partners.   This hour lesson took place four hours ago!!!    I am currently doing a pub crawl in Cave Creek, AZ and am HAPPY to report that she is walking on her leash and an AMAZING transformation has already taken place!!!   I am so proud!!!  She is walking beside me, without pulling, right by my side!!!  She has encountered several dogs and she still stayed in form.  So IMPRESSED!!!     Thank you!!!!   Can't wait for our next lesson!!!!   I am even thinking about dropping her off for CAMP!!!  So HAPPY!!!

I would really, really, really like to give this place a glowing review HOWEVER I have never in my life, in all the cities I've been to, eaten at a domestic restaurant that did not have a restroom for customers.     WTF!!!??!!!   Even in third world countries, you can slip someone $5 to use the restroom!   They'll even throw in some sheets of toilet paper...  I wish I had some of the juvenile attributes, I despise, in some of my more interesting friends.   I'd love to pull my pants down and pee on their patio.

Location, location, location!!!  There are not many places in Tempe that you can live and be a three minute walk to the light rail, a five minute walk to the lake, and a seven minute walk to a trail with waterfalls that leads you to a pyramid near the entrance of a world-class zoo!!!  I have lived at the lofts since 2011.  And while living at the lofts is a stretch for me financially, I absolutely love living here!  The views are spectacular - I feel like I'm living in a castle!!!  My apartment overlooks the freeway, all of downtown Tempe, trains, the light rail, and I love watching the planes take off and land.  The community is dog friendly and there is a 24-hour leash free dog park, within a three minute drive, in a park it also has tons of trails for biking or hiking.  There are two very nice pools that are well-maintained. They are heated during the winter.  The maintenance staff is wonderful!!!  They are extremely responsive and I enjoy my conversations that I have with them every day when I walk around the property.  I don't have as much opportunity to interact with the staff at the leasing office however anytime I've had an issue they have been really pleasant and easy to work with!  Most of my interactions with them are when I pick up my packages - they are always cheerful & friendly!

Great breakfast....pleasant servers, fast seating!!!  Every other place has a 30 minute wait for Sunday breakfast here but you can get seated right away and the breakfast is just as good.
