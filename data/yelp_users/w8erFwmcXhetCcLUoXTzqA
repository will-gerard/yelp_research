Let me start by saying that I've been coming here often. This is just a sum of my overall experience thus far. The Carne asada, the shredded beef and chicken is seasoned decently. Not the greatest but it does the job. The Carne asada taco salad is very filling and is consistently good. Fish tacos are consistently good. Food overall is decent and consistent.  Service: not so much. There have been plenty of times where I have ordered for me and my wife. Other times for a much larger group. They have consistently forgotten food and/or the extra stuff I've ordered like salsa or the onion and cilantro-their "pico". Sometimes you are greeted warmly and feel welcomed. Other times its a time where you catch them in a not so pleasant mood. But that only entails less warmth and a look of "why are you here?" I wonder if this is because another late night place opened close to them?  Over all I think imma stay back from this place for a bit. See what happens at a later time. I think I used the word consistent too much. But it's vital to the service industry.

So.... as I write this I am literally outside of the shop. It is 1055a. Doors are not open and its a cool, brisk 105+ degrees outside... in the shade. I'm put into weird place to be in when you are sweating your butt off outside waiting for a good haircut and the barber hasnt shown up yet. You call to the second location and they cant help you either.  Well im sure they can if you drive down the street and see their present and availabe barbers.  But to locate your barber for this location,  no help. Funny thing is the other patrons that are out here with me sweating and frustrated tell me that this happens often. So in my head im thinking. Wait and hope for the barber to show up, if he shows up. Then wait again inside of this unique and awesomely decorated place. Try to cool off. Sit in the chair for a good hair cut. Pay and leave. Or just leave. Not come back. And find a new barber were they typically will show up on time. Wait for a hair cut and leave not sweating and suffering outside waiting for heat stroke. Hello car and ac. Finished typing this at 1100. And doors still not opened. That is 1 hour and ticking.

To be brief: my wife, brothers, sisters, family and friends will NOT be coming back to this little shop of seafood horror. What happend? You are asking. Maybe he's new to this? I am not. I've eaten at many seafood and cajun places. I will keep this brief as i can. i need to literally throw up my disappointing meal. We were there around 730 tonight. To start the waitress messed up some of our orders. When she tried to explain the correction it was done so in a confusing manner. When we asked about a clarifocation or when we repeated what we heard he say it was met with an attitude. Fast forward to the meal. I ordered the shrimp and a lobster. The shrimp was old and grainy/mushy. The meat was not as plump as it should have been. The shell was difficult to remove from some of the shrimp. NOW the effing HORROR. The Lobster. When I cracked into the first claw I was greeted with a little over 1/4 of a cup of juicesnpourong out of the claw. The meat in the claw is suppose to be plump. This was not. This one looked like an eldery persons wrinkly-I-use-to-be-over-weight-hand but in a lobster claw form. The second was no better. Next I decided to take the tail off to see if it can salvage the dismal meal. WHY THE HELL DID I TAKE THE TAIL OFF?!! The horror that was waiting for me came OOZING out. Confirmed by my horrified and disgusted family... the tail was still VERY RAW and had a fair amount of feces in the tail, AND the meat was old. The colors (and don't read this if you are squeamish) were black, mucus green, and brown surrounded  by translucent/slightly opaque withered meat. And I mean this... plenty Slime. I put everything down. And kept as quiet and calm as I could. I reached for the first person I saw, tall large guy short brown hair. I showed and told him about the lobster. He quickly took it away. They offered to cook me a new one. I declined. I didn't touch anything else not even my drink as I began to grow very nauseous sick and warm. I really needed that drink though. I dry heaved a few times by the car. Got home. Threw up what I could. Now fighting to write this review in hopes to save anyone else from this. I hope I can make it to work tomorrow, with few "interruptions" and hopefully make it for thanksgiving. Once again... wife, brothers, sisters, family will not return. I will share our experience with our friends and extended family.

Service is a little slow at the bar. The service at the tables are a little better. Food is good. The chefs that come out are very entertaining and fun.  Been here a few times with large parties and other times with like 4 people. Sushi stays together for the most part. Appetizers and entr√©es are seasoned well and consistent. The establishment is overall clean.   I'd go back. Kinda fun here.

I do like this place. Finally! One our aide. They are fairly new to open and I know it takes a while to get the system and the employees down and trained. So I can slide on the service and knowledge of the menu and system. No biggie. Food is consistent and they are very happy to help and greet you. The management team seems to work hard I  educating and informing everyone on all levels. Good to see. Establishment is clean and welcoming. And the drive thru is open till 12! Definitely a plus!
