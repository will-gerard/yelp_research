This review is for their most recent Mother's Day Brunch.  We arrived to the Royal Palms resort and were immediately greeted by the valet - I had assumed it would be a challenge to deal with parking but we pulled right up and were immediately escorted to the hostess stand.  We were the first in our party to arrive so they showed me to the table while my wife waited for everyone else.  When I got to the table they'd set up some umbrellas to provide shade; however the sun had moved so the table wasn't completely in the shade - they took the initiative to move the umbrellas.  They even brought another umbrella over to increase the shade.  With this I could tell that they were prepared to provide the best possible experience.  The rest of our crew finally showed up, the server took our drink order and we were released to hit the buffet.  Here's where things got interesting - you know how when you go to a buffet there are your obligatory items and much of the food is cold or underwhelming?  Well, NONE of that was present.  Sure, there were items one would expect (prime rib, leg of lamb, a mountain of bacon, etc.) but the majority of the offerings were truly unique.  The prime rib was fabulous!  I could write an entire tome on how perfect it was, but alas, I'll move on.  The omelet station was packed full of options and your omelet was cooked to order.  They had some potato-gratin that were a little too good - my wife kept swiping bites off my plate.  After I'd taken advantage of their mountain of proteins, I figured I'd be a bit responsible and hit their cold-salad table.  That's where I'd discovered my mistake - there were about 20 different options, and each of them were fantastic.  The chorizo shrimp & mussels were so good I went back, twice, for them.  Anyway, I could keep writing about how awesome the food was, but my main point is that there wasn't a single item in this massive buffet that wasn't top-notch.  I'm pretty sure that my family is going to consider T.Cooks our go-to spot for brunch now on!  Thank you to everyone that worked on Mother's Day - you made our experience memorable.  For that, there are no adequate words of appreciation.

We went to CCOM for two reasons: 1) we had a gift certificate. 2) we saw on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on Food Network.  I have no idea how it got that rating - while the food wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't the best thing I ever ate.  The portions were absolutely LAME!  Seriously - $9 for a sandwich that left me hungry.  The one they showed on Food Network actually had more than one layer of meat - not mine.  They MUST have paid Beau Macmillan a lot of money to talk highly about the sandwich - he even held his finger & thumb up to indicate how thick the sandwich was.  Read the rest of the reviews.  These guys are cashing in on the kitchy nature of the place - they're not earning their money!

I need to point out how accommodating the staff was . . .  I visited ATAH after the Strong Beer Festival; as you might imagine the place was a mad-house.  That's an understatement.  In fact, the line to the restroom was almost out the door.  Anyway, we were put on a wait for seating.  After about an hour we were notified that a table was ready.  It was the worst table in the place - the one RIGHT next to the line of people waiting to use the restroom.  My comment to them was a bit gruff - "hell no, I'm not sitting where I get to stare at drunk people's asses while I eat" (my apologies to the staff).  They didn't blink an eye or even once get a snotty tone.  They were very professional.  They put us back in the list and we were seated at a better table as one came available.  Once seated we were treated to fabulous service and amazing food.  I'm going back for sure.  Again, ATAH Staff - my apologies for being a difficult patron.  You handled it very well!

My wife took me to The House Brasserie for my birthday dinner.  We told them we wanted a "Chef's Choice" experience - this means we'll eat whatever they send out.  Our server was awesome and very helpful.  She helped guide us through the entire evening with wine pairings and wow, did she do a great job.  The chef, Matt Hobbs, also came out a few times to see how everything was going.  The food was amazing - I love that they're not stuck in any particular genre; instead the flavors included traditional, Asian, BBQ . . .   Anyway, I highly suggest THB, especially if you're adventurous to let someone else choose the plates.
