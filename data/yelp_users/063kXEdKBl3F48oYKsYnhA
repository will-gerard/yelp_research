Great food every time, lots of lovely staff, a bit rough around the edges but if you want someone to wipe your mouth after each bite, don't go to an English pub.   Decor is warm and cozy, almost that if it's in the middle of London. Tons of seating, booths, tables, and bar seating available. They've even got a pool table for those with short attention spans while drinking. :)   The best thing about this place is, according to the Boyfriend, you can chat with locals or chill in a corner and enjoy the environment and not be bothered. Poker night on Wednesdays draws a bunch of old timer locals. Trivia night on Thursdays is apparently bustin at the seams, I'll be back to check that out too.   Drinks are rockin, food is excellent every time. What more could you ask for? It feels like home. Home sweet pub.

So, if I were thrashed and needing food like NOW, I'd give it better stars. It was sub-par ingredients thrown onto a plate and cost boyfriend and I about $15.   He got the Nacho Supreme. It's comparable what you'd get at a Little League snack bar. Chips, "cheese sauce", dry shredded chicken, olives, and jalapenos. Let's say the only thing gone from the plate at the end of the meal were the chips.   I got the "chicken and salsa" burrito. It was mostly shredded chicken (which was dry, by the way), mixed in with some salsa (very spicy), about 10 strips of shredded lettuce, and unmelted shredded cheese. The tortilla was the best part.   Don't think we'll be going back.

Very friendly! They made sure I didn't leave without getting every possible discount that I was eligible for! The lady who helped me, believe her name was Tina?, even waited on the phone for about 30 mins to make sure I would be quoted the correct price.   I'd definitely recommend them as someone who moved out of state and wanted to keep State Farm.

This place is absolutely amazing!   Truly delicious food and some very tasty beers! We went on week night and it was packed but very quick in service. Boyfriend got the nacho appetizer and I got the Four Peaks Burger and both were outstanding. The nachos were big enough for me to take home as leftovers for another full meal.   The oooooonly reason I don't give it 5 stars is because parking is a bit tough and it was pretty chilly in the restaurant. I wish I would have brought a bigger jacket.

Clean, fast, friendly! What more could you want?   Minus a point for the location. I had to dodge 3 random people aimlessly walking/riding bikes around the parking lot. It's a while lot of the kind of people who aimlessly wander the Fry's parking lot next door. It's right next to a light rail stop in a shady part of town.   Aaaaand I forgot to ask for my drink cold...they didn't ask but I don't have the heart to ask for it to be different because the lady was so nice. Thankful for a good hazelnut macchiato near by.

Just so everyone knows, when you order pad thai with medium spicy, be prepared to drink an entire gallon of milk with your order. I've never had anything so hot before. My boyfriend, who loves Thai Spicy, couldn't even stomach his order of medium spice pad thai either. Maybe I'll order NO spice next time. If we go back.

Spot on pho than and spring rolls every time! It's quick, very inexpensive, but is not lacking in flavor.   Boyfriend and I have tried other things here as well and we haven't been disappointed.   On average, your wait time for getting food is about 5 minutes after you walk in the front door. :)

I found this salon on a whim. Let me tell you, it is a whim I'm extremely thankful for! I had some time to kill and felt it was time to clean up my cuticles and try a gel manicure. Enter the angel of a nail stylist: Tiffany.   She was attentive, professional, personable, and very welcoming. She offered me a cold bottle of water to quench my thirst that the hot Arizona sun caused. She then helped me though what type of polished to choose. I wanted a natural colored polish with glitter tips. She walked me through which would look best together and that we should use actual glitter rather than a glitter polish and encouraged to do a fading glitter tip rather than a harsh line. When she shaped my nails, which I'm usually particular about because I do my own nails weekly, she was very good at asking me what shape I wanted and once one was shaped, confirmed that they were what I wanted.   Not only was she detailed and thorough with color choices and shaping, but she did 3 coats for me because 2 wasn't quite opaque enough. After all of this work, I was AMAZED at what happened to my nails. She wrapped the tips, did even and thick coats. My cuticles are trimmed perfectly, and all was done with a nice conversation and smile from a friendly lady who stayed engaged in our hour long meeting.   Tiffany is the best manicurist I've ever had and am a believer in gel manicures now! Thank you, Tiffany! I'll be seeing you each time I come into town!

I really wanted to like this place. I really did.   I went here on a Thursday night with the boyfriend. It was busy, but not busy enough to warrant us being forgotten about for 25 minutes after being seated. Now, you'd think that after a server forgot about a table, they'd do their best to be on top of service: not the case. We saw our waitress one more time to ask how our food was, but she was gone before we could answer. We had to grab another waitress to get our check because after an hour and a half of being here, we wanted to go home. We had finished our food long ago. A different waitress happy got our check and apologized for the bad service. That's why this place got any stars for my vote.   If only the food was good. Nope. Boyfriend's cheeseburger was chewy and unseasoned. Mine would have been okay if it had been seasoned at all and the patty hadn't been burned. Boyfriend said his was burned as well.   It was too loud to hear yourself, let alone your attending party. Disadvantage.   Honestly, this made me sad. I'm hopeful that it was the high bustle of the night that made our experience so terrible. I'm hesitant to give it another try. Sad.

If you're considering a visit, DO IT!  I followed Tiffany (the daughter of the group) from a previous salon because she's THAT good. I've been doing manicures on myself for years because I didn't trust anyone else to do them well (lots of wasted time and money). I found her and I was immediately sold. I currently live in California and still only go to her when I come visit. Thank goodness I'm moving to the area soon!   It's clean, friendly, personal, professional, and fun!   Brand massage pedicure chairs mixed with a hot stone and oil rub...I was in heaven.

Went in for an oil change and "free" car wash, and was not impressed.   The gentleman that helped me with my oil change was quiet, difficult to hear in the noisy car bay, and he was constantly trying to up sell me on EVERYTHING. Not to mention, when I asked how much an oil change is, he said "$35 for oil change and car wash". I said okay, then he asked what type of oil I wanted. Now, granted, I'm not a mechanic and I know my car has high mileage but I didn't know if he was asking for a brand, regular or synthetic....I had to pry options out of him. Very quiet options, mind you. I asked for high mileage and without notifying me, it actually wasn't $35...it's $55. I'm not an unreasonable person. I know it probably costs more...but at least tell me the new price. Then again, maybe he did and I just couldn't hear him.   Employee- "what kind of car wash do you want?" Me- "....well, what kind do you have?"  Employee- "there's a poster on the outside of the car bay over there"  Employee- "what kind of air freshener do you want?"  Me- (again) "... Well, what kind do you have? " Annoying. Give your customers options before they have to coax them out of you.   To top it off, there's a charge for my bottom-of-the-line-car-wash weighing in at $3. Really? So my "$35 oil change and wash" became a $55 oil change and $3 car wash, with tax...costing me $60. I'll change my oil myself next time.

They've been awesome the two times I've been here. I needed a battery change on a car I wanted to sell. My car must have known too because the battery died the day before my trade in. The manager helped me out, sold me a gently used battery with a 30 day warranty so that I didn't have to pay full price for a fancy one. And he installed it! Talk about a knight in shining armor. Dominic has also helped me too, all super nice, speedy, and incredibly helpful.

We've been here about 5 times or so now, mostly to dine in and one occurrence of take out.  In a nutshell: this place fricken rocks.  There is probably the nicest gentleman on the planet here. I think he's the owner. Anyway, I want to be friends with this guy...he's attentive, kind, and very, very appreciative.   I've had their chicken Pad Thai multiple times. It's light but full of flavor with moist chicken and a balance of flavors. They give you a nicely sized lime for zing, plenty of meat, peanuts, and thinly sliced fresh veggies to mix in with your piping hot noodles that are thinner than you might expect but oh so delicious.   Tonight, I had their Drunken Beef Noodle. Oh. My. Gosh. I don't know that I've ever had such a deliciously flavored beef dish that was so flavorful but not at all heavy. Crisp bell peppers, beautifully saut√©ed onions, tender strips of beef perfectly cooked. Holy cow. Seriously.   In a nutshell of the previous nutshell, eat here. You won't be disappointed.
