Customer service sucks at this gym. I signed up for the personal training and liked the trainer but working with the gym to schedule the trainings was a nightmare. I would show up only to find out my session had been cancelled without letting me know. Sometimes they would call me an hour before my training to let me know it was cancelled, that's if I was lucky. They would make excuses and never follow through on calling me back.

Enjoyed my food but found it very messy and hard to eat. I ordered the tacos but ended up eating it with a fork and knife. That's my only complaint everything else was good.

I've used their services 3 times now and they've always done a good job. They are quick, punctual, professional and get the job done.
