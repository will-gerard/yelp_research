Four Peaks is the most well known brewery in Arizona, but it is certainly not the best.  The 4.5 rating on here actually breaks my beer-loving heart.  There are good, and even great, breweries in Arizona -- this just isn't one of them.  This location of Four Peaks is near the University, so parking is hard to come by.  I went when school wasn't in session, thinking it would be less busy...wrong!  Not wanting to wait for a table, we sat at the bar.  We should have known something was wrong when we ordered a beer flight and everyone stared at us.  You people are at a brewery and you've never seen a flight?  The guys next to us actually asked what it was....  The flight is a great deal at $10, and comes with a ridiculous number of beers.  I can't say that any of them were better than a 3 out of 5 star rating.  I actually left a few beers standing at the end of the night, the Hefeweizen and the Peach beer. The IPAs were not good either.  I've had their pumpkin porter in the past, and that is probably their best showing.  I can't speak to the food, but look at the photos...does this look like 4.5 star food?  The place is loud, the music is terrible, and the beer is cheap.  I suppose this is every college kids dream.  This brew house was built with a certain demographic in mind, and I am definitely NOT part of that group.

5 stars for holiday dinner selection and quality,  2 stars for dessert  All of the attention these days seems to be on the newer buffets at Caesars, Aria and the Cosmo.  After a disappointing experience at the Cosmo, I was left wanting for more and decided to try an old classic.  The holiday dinner buffet at the Bellagio was an exceptional display of Vegas extravagance.  While not much to look at in terms of decor, the endless meat/seafood selections made up for the poor ambiance.  King crab, caviar, shrimp, seabass, ahi poke, mussels, quality sushi, smoked salmon, lamb, brisket, ribs, beef wellington, prime rib, kobe beef roast, game hens, flank steak, short ribs.  The prime rib and the ribs fell flat, but the rest was very tasty - especially the lamb.  I love that they have all of the necessary condiments: mustard, mint jelly, au jus, horseradish, etc...  I never eat pizza at a buffet - filler - but the pizza here is very good.  The truffle pizza and the beet/goat cheese were the best.  Some of the specialty salads here were good, but the other sides were just okay.  The big draws here are defiantly the carving stations and the seafood.  Where everything starts to fall apart, is with the dessert.  Ugh.  Really bad 90s era soft-serve and super sweet cakes/cookies.  I just can't give it the full five stars until they upgrade that section.

Part of me knew this before I took my first bite but, this just doesn't live up to the hype.  I mean, nothing really could live up to the hype built around this place! To be fair, it is great pizza.  I just isn't "the best pizza".  There are numerous places in San Francisco that would beat this one out.  Upon entering the restaurant, at noonish on a Sunday, we were surprised to see it half empty.  I was also surprised to be cheerfully greeted by Chef Chris himself!  For how slow the restaurant was, our table service was also slow.  We did get some yummy olives to eat while we waited, nice touch.  Our favorite pizzas were the sausage and the red onion/pistachio (I forget the names).  I would actually skip the famous margarita, I didn't think the flavor of the cheese or the sauce really shined through.  I think if I went back I would try one of their pasta dishes.  They serve a small entree menu, in addition to the pizzas, at this location.

I can't understand why this place gets such high ratings.  The burgers are just not good.   The meat was flavorless and tasted low quality.  The fries and tots were ok, but nothing special.  The worst part was the service-we waited an hour to receive our burgers.  The only highlight was the Jamaican corn side dish.  I would not return.

If you are looking for a place to grab a healthy, yet delicious meal-this is your place!  The chicken and kale wrap was really good, and tasted fresh.  The kale salad was good as well.  The best is the "Cheat Day Wrap".  Although not as healthy as the other options, the flavor makes it worth the extra calories.  If you are extra hungry, get a side of quinoa.  It is only a $1.50 and the portion is pretty huge for the price.

I often complain that breweries either have good beer or good food - never both.  Arizona Wilderness is a welcome exception to this rule.    These guys are currently the most talked about brewery in Arizona, and for good reason.  They brew a wide range of beers, and the tap list is never the same.  I tried a sampler flight, which included 5 5 oz beers, and every one of them was good.  I even enjoyed the barleywine, a style I don't often appreciate.   Even if I didn't drink beer (now that's a funny thought!), I would come here for the food.  The green chili pulled pork sliders are so good that I ate them two days in a row!  They are served on mini pretzel buns and topped with cheese.  I recommend getting them with pepper jack cheese and a side of beer-B-Q sauce.  The three sliders ($6.99) are filled with juicy pulled pork, and are more than enough for an entree.  If you want a side, the green salad ($5.99) tasted fresh and was more than enough for two.  The atmosphere here is perfect - totally relaxed.  I just wish this place was closer to home!
