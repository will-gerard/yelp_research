Let me start off this post by saying I am a huge CPK fan. I have found multiple dishes that I love and am never disappointed.   This location is absolutely beautiful. They really did an amazing job putting it together. That being said, I visited on a Monday afternoon and received amazing service. Really, so quick too! Maybe because it was empty but sometimes you get worse service when that is the case.  CPK offers bread free with some oil and their bread is delicious. On this trip, I ordered the B-B-Q chicken salad and it is one of my favorites... Always delicious and fresh!  Really, my favorite part of this CPK was the layout. It really gives you a great environment to be able to sit, relax, and enjoy a nice meal. You must check out this location!

My experience at this restaurant was poor... Very poor. But you may have a different hopefully better experience while visiting.  We sat in the bar area since its self seating and after being there for a while a server finally runs by and says I'll be with you shortly to run to help a huge party who down after us. So we switched to the dining room.   We told our server about this experience and she told the manager who came and apologized which was great. Then the bar area server comes in w/ a defensive I'm sorry but ... Using but while saying sorry is never a good thing #TotallyAwkward  Then we are able to order and this server did a much better job and was nice. I ordered a salad asking for no carrots because I am incredibly allergic and the salad came with carrots. Honesty, complaining would have been pointless.  Our fajitas came delivered by a man who said nothing and awkwardly shoved them on the table. The fajitas weren't even sizzling! The server came and we told her so she brought them out sizzling. At this point we were tired and over it and just wanted to leave.  This place seems a little under staffed and I was not very impressed. I will not be back.

This place is a coffee purists dream! I absolutely loved the decor and vibe here. As a first timer, I didn't know what to order. After talking to the barista she assured me that she knew what to make.  A few minutes later I had an amazing drink that was perfect for a hot afternoon Monday. It was the perfect pick me up! Can you tell? I am a total fan... Definitely will be back.

I visited this restaurant on a very busy Monday night. However, there was no wait to be seated and my sister and I were placed at a great spot on the patio. It was quite nice to relax and enjoy dinner outside with a great ambiance.   We started off with an order of the chips and guac and they were both delicious. The chips are a little thicker than your average chip but it was a great size to hold the guac.  We then ordered the Margherita Pizza and asked them to add chicken. Gotta have some protein right? The pizza was delicious but the amount of chicken was quite minimal (hence the 4 stars) only leaving me wishing I had more chicken and less pizza.  Overall this place was really good and they had quite a variety of options. Give it a try... I think you will love it!

Let me start off by saying I love frozen yogurt. It is one of my favorite things in the world. On a hot night in Arizona, it was the perfect spot to hit up.  This store has a really chill environment which I loved! There were some comfy chairs inside that were really cute. I love that they have sample cups on the counter. I'm not gonna get crazy with them but it's nice to try a flavor before you get a huge cup full of it.   There were plenty of toppings to pick from and everything looked very clean and well taken care of. And the gentlemen who worked there was really nice.   I'm sure you will love this place... Give it a try!

Normally, I have a poor experience with blow dry salons. But I am so happy to say that it was not the case this time!   I got THE BEST stylist... I wished I lived in AZ so I could go all the time but unfortunately I was just visiting for a conference.   Normally, my hair falls flat pretty soon after a blow out, but my hair looked amazing and smelled amazing all day after this one. I really can't say enough good things about this place... Cute location, cute decor, such a great experience! Thank you Dry Bar!

Coffee lovers rejoice! Especially if you are at a conference at the Phoenix Convention Center and need a quick pick me up during the day. This shop is just a short walk from the conference and you will probably love the fresh air too.  If you are a coffee lover... or not, this place has some great coffee. You may become a coffee lover after visiting ;) The staff is incredible friendly and this location is super cute. You will love this great find!
