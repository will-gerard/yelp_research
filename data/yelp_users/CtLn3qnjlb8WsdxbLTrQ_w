Whole Foods in Tempe has such a great atmosphere, wonderful employees and great great great food. The cheese selection is the best in the valley and they will cut most of the cheeses to any size/price you like.  So you can try really fancy goat cheeses without breaking the bank. The veggie section is HUGE and they have stuff you use every day, and stuff you have never seen before (ever had a star fruit? i hadn't either!)  Their wine selection is great and the prepared foods is super delicious too!  I shop here a few times a week and I always come away happy :)

I am sorry but I can't pay $25 for a drop in yoga class. I can go to 2 yoga classes at most places in the valley for this price. I did loved going here when it was less pricey, the classes are really fun, most of the teachers play upbeat music to keep the class motivated.  The classes are more fun than a spiritual practice, but if you are looking for a good time after work that doesn't involve booze and you have money coming out of your ears...check this place out!  Please At One Yoga, have a heart for us students!!  Lower your prices!!
