I have been going to this 24 H location for two years. When I started it was decent, now it is terrible. Downhill all together.   Half the cardio equipment is broken on a daily basis, the smell is terrible in there, always out of sanitizer and paper towels, the front desk clerks are somber and unattentive. The AC was broken on and off throughout the AZ summer and the front desk would deny it was broken one day, then the next day a different person would admit it was broken and in process of being fixed. That whole ordeal lasted a few weeks.   The only positive is the classes. They are always enjoyable and the instructors are great!

Had the Chicken Teriyaki. It was awful. No flavor, the chicken was fatty. Took two bites and threw it in the trash. It was so bad I was fearful of food poisoning. Just didn't seem fresh. The one star is because I had to give it a star to even write this. For $10 I would rather have Chipotle.

Been here 3 times this month. The chicken shwarma plate and gyro plate are excellent. The prices are great, portions are huge and i can never finish it all. Service is good. Highly recommend!

I have gone to AZ Tip & Toe for 6 years, religiously every 10 days. Jason and Tracy (the owners) run this place very well. It is always clean and the tools are always fresh out of the sanitizing machine. They use high quality gel polish and products. The prices are affordable. The only complaint is that they don't seem to ever have adequate staff for busy times such as evenings and weekend. I would suggest making an appt if you don't want to wait.

Goober is a great pet store. I am in Phoenix, so they deliver my cats food right to my front door for free! They have unbeatable prices on Wellness brand canned cat food.

I went to Urban 7 twice since it opened. Hoping the second time it might redeem itself. The food was not good at all. I had a BLT the first time and a chicken sandwich the second. Two things you think would be hard to mess up? Cold, the bacon looked like bacon bits from a can (was expecting fresh juicy, crispy bacon), the sauce that they put all over the chicken sandwich tasted like pure wasabi. In addition to this the service was poor both times, the restuarant was empty yet the service was lagging. The waiter would have 20 min conversations with people who clearly were trying to eat dinner and not interested in chatting, but just were being polite. All this while his 2 other tables (mine) and another couple sat and rolled there eyes at eachother.  They were out of major things on the menu. The presentation of the food could use work as well. It just seems like this place is on the cusp of closing down and keeps changing the menu in hopes of it working but need to focus more on perfecting simple items on there initial menu, presentation and service rather than weak attempts to change the menu everytime they get a bad review on here.  The location is great, the interior is great, the patio wonderful. This actual structure has great potential. I know that this is owned by Frank and Lupes, which is excellent, so maybe they need to focus there efforts on one thing and not get too much in the hopper.

The service was great. That's all that was great. Ordered the wedge salad and the blue cheese on it was grayish black in color. They took it back. The pizza was the worst I've had. Dijorno would of been better at home in the oven. Never again.

The service was good, atmosphere fine. I had a chopped chicken salad. It had 5 tiny slices of chicken, a 1/2 cup of iceberg, an entire raw onion cut on top, a few tomatoes. It was a salad I could have purchased in a bag at the grocery store, only difference was it was $13. Not impressed.

The salon is great! The spray tan was even and wonderful. The owner is very pleasant and makes you feel very welcome and comfortable. The prices are reasonable. The only thing I disliked was that I went at night and the building that the suite is in is dark, parking lot empty, no lights and when i was leaving there were not one, but TWO strange men lurking in the parking lot. I had that fast heart beating moment of fear to get to my car as fast as possible. It would be nice if they left lights on for Phoenix Glow since they have evening hours, but it appears all the other suites likely close up at 5PM. Maybe its just me being a scaredy cat though!

I went here for lunch one day, and it is excellent! I had a chicken bowl, and the chicken was sooo wonderful and flavorful. The service was good over the noon hour, and the decor and vibe was nice. I would go back for sure!

I have been here on several occasions for lunch/dinner. Service was good, food is good, prices are decent. I always order the gyro and hummus for an app. I just wish they served rice with the gyro! I love rice.

I don't know if it was an off day, or if I just liked this place in college because I had no taste buds after a long day of drinking. This place has nothing on Chipoltle. The chicken was dry, salsa had no kick, and rice has no flavor.

Donna does a great job! The spray tan is always even, great color and lasts for a week! She manages the place very well. I am always taken in for my appt on time. Arizona Airbrush prices are the best in Old Town!

I sent my sister flowers today and she loved them! They are the most gorgeous pink lily bouquet I have seen from a florist in my life. The prices were very reasonable and the customer service was superb!

I had a cod taco and a chicken taco. Both were very good! The service was excellent, and the patio is nice. The only complaint was that I have had better margaritas, larger, stronger etc for less $ at Blanco or elsewhere. But overall this is a great place.   It's a very casual, laid back crowd, not the Scottsdale scene you might find other places in the area.
