Loud, full of families and kids, and extra greasy food.   This place takes bar food to a whole new level. Every single item is artery clogging, dripping in grease. Even the breads don't get away without a slathering of butter.   We pretty much had to yell across the table to talk, due to the several large screen tvs turned up full volume, background music, and screaming kids.   Our waitress was typical of what I expect from this type of establishment, the most attentive thing about her were her half covered breasts.   I had the blt, and asked for avacado on it, with an iced tea. The sandwich was big on the bacon, though it was all in little pieces and kept falling out of the sandwich.  The bread and bacon were practically dripping in grease. The avacado was forgotten by the kitchen, but the waitress did remember to bring it out quickly. The fries that came with my food were actually pretty good, and the iced tea was huge (so I didn't run out when the waitress never returned).   I went through about three napkins due to the grease and had to take some pepto afterwards.   I recommend this place to people who insist on taking their poorly behaving children out to eat, and want something trashy for the men in their party to stare at.

We were in the mood for wings and their half price reverse happy hour. Everyone was nice, the food was good, we shared the regular boneless wings, barbecue boneless wings, and mozzarella sticks.   However.  About a half hour, maybe an hour at most, both of us were horribly sick. All last night, and now today too. My girlfriend had to leave work she's so sick (I told her not to go into work with food poisoning...) It was probably the chicken wings. At least its friday now so we can be sick at home and not worry about working.

We went here for my girlfriends brother in laws birthday (confusing?). We were sat in a large booth, 8 adults, one toddler, and a newborn baby.   Even though we were in a large booth, it was still a tight fit, also, the carrier (with the baby in it) was on the floor most of the time, until they brought us a chair to put the carrier on.  The atmosphere of this place is LOUD. Not just music, but people talking loudly as well. The walls beyond covered in "stuff", things like dollar bills, stuffed dead animals, panties, pictures, license plates, I guess the closest thing you could guess in theme would be "trailer park".   The waitress was not accommodating to the noise, and spoke mostly in a whisper. She spent most of the time looking annoyed, speaking in a low voice that we could barely hear, and acting spastic (not taking our orders in an orderly way, bringing some food but not all that we had ordered, refilling some drinks but not others, etc).   I ordered the Prime Rib, rare, with mashed potatoes. It came with a side salad consisting of iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, and minced green olives. An odd combination. The prime rib was overly marinated in "smoke flavor" and had more flavor reminiscent of ham than of prime rib. It was a good portion. The mashed potatoes were dry and partially cold, not very flavorful. I requested no gravy, yet my mashed potatoes still had that dip in them where you would normally put gravy, meaning I had a very small portion of mashed potatoes (that you probably don't notice when you get gravy).   My girlfriend had the same thing I did but medium instead of rare like I did, everyone else in the party had the chicken fried steak. My girlfriend was as disappointed in her food as I was. Everyone who ordered chicken fried steak loved it. It really is a giant portion, two, three servings really. Most everyone took some of theirs home. Though the two people from texas said it wasn't the best chicken fried steak they'd ever had, and I'd take that recommendation into consideration. Texas people know their chicken fried steak.   For dessert my girlfriend and I shared the peach cobbler. This menu description is inaccurate, its more akin to yellow cake with peach filling. Tasty, but not what we expected. They do use blue bunny ice cream though, which is awesome.   About an hour after dinner my girlfriend and I both felt a little sick from dinner. We didn't get sick, but definitely needed some pepto.

So you're with a bunch of people who like chicken fried steak, and they say, hey theres this steak house you should try with us. This should be your first warning. If a steak house is known for its chicken fried steak, something is not right.  Maybe you're different, maybe you think, sure, they like chicken fried steak, and I like fried asshole. Then this is your place!  Now, you go in, and ahh the ambiance, shit on the walls as far as the eye can see, oh and not just the walls, the ceiling as well! Its jam packed, you can't hear the person in front of you, you're thinking, when's the last time they dusted all this crap? How much falls in my food from the lazy ceiling fans.   Its hot and a bit humid to, maybe to recreate that true texas experience?  So you order your tbone, medium rare, side of mashed potatoes and hell, some okra while you're at it. Good okra is hard to find in these parts.  The okra, crispy, soft inside (once its done being molten lava), perfect. Don't bother with the sauce unless your garnish for okra is tartar sauce.  Hey, a side salad come with it! Oh, the tiny diced tomatoes, ice burg lettuce, and what an interesting mix, diced green olives all over the top, in giant piles.  Now your entree comes, but the waitress, if you're lucky, has worked there 4 years! Shes got a blond dye job, too much eye makeup, and a perm. She makes sure to leave every single dish on the table, just in case you missed one delicious crumb. At some point she might drop by one basket of rolls, for a table of 8. The buttermilk ones taste homemade, not bad!  Oh yes, the entree, a tbone, super thin, in what is that? Its pooling everywhere, oh god the grease. You did order your steak with a large slathering of grease right? Well those mashed potatoes, which are thick and standard, are drenched in heavy white gravy, and all the blandness of the gravy helps soak up all that grease!  So you're almost done with your food, omg, your giant glass is empty? Where was that waitress? Oh don't worry, just grab her by the arm and she'll try to remember to refill your drink. And those extra plates, well if they're really bothering you you can ask a bus person to take them, though you might as well be asking them to lick your shoe (or eat what you just did).   Now you're full, you've paid, and because of its "prime" location, you get to cross a busy intersection to get to the car you had to park across the street.   Might as well just wait to get home to pee too, its sweltering in there, more crap on the walls and ceiling, and you pretty much have to stand on the toilet to get the stall door closed.

Like many people, I have some wisdom teeth. Like they do, two started to rebel and had to go. I finally gave up just dealing with the pain and called around to a few dentists.   I called one place, but from its website and description, it sounded really pricey, plus all the online reviews on it were shit. They were open late and weekends though.  I call this place second. They aren't open late, but very early (7am), and one saturday a month. I called on a Saturday and someone actually answered and took my appointment for that Tuesday.  I arrived early, its a small place with not very much parking, but very easy to find. The inside is pretty small too, but nice. Theres a couch with tv, and not crappy tv that just shows dental commercials. Theres a small area to get coffee, and a mini fridge with drinks right in the main area. Its not decorated or lit up like a normal dentist office either, its all regular comfy furniture and lamps instead of crap office furniture and florescent lighting.   When I asked about my appointment there was some confusion, and it seemed like the nice person I spoke to on saturday had not actually made my appointment. They didn't tell me this, but it was easy to figure out since they had none of my info and no idea who I was. They were happy to still accommodate me though, and in a few minutes I was taken into one of the rooms, where a very nice assistant took my ex rays and prelim questions.  I have been to the dentist enough to know that usually the first time you go you get a consultation, and the real work starts on the next visit. When the dentist came in and asked me about my teeth, had a poke around, and confirmed that both wisdom teeth on the right side had to go. I was shocked when he offered to take them out right then! Now, the may not seem exciting to anyone else, but I was in excruciating pain. And I'm not one of those people that needs to be put under to get teeth pulled. I have a high pain tolerance. He also said he could get me out of there and to work in a couple hours.   The work was what I consider pretty typical, the dentist and assistant were nice, kept me up to date on what was going on while they were working and making sure I was doing ok, numb enough, etc.  I have terrible allergies and ended up getting dry socket from all my sneezing. I called the dentist the next week, and the couple times I've been in to have the dry socket dressing changed (which btw is disgusting, clove flavored crap), they always were able to get me in right away and super nice about it. They also haven't needed to be reminded that I'm allergic to latex, which the doctors office I've been going to for over a year can't seem to remember.  I don't think theres anyway to make the pain of having teeth pulled not hurt later, so I did spend a few days right after the first appt feeling like someone had punched me in the face.   If you're looking for an awesome dentist and don't need one of those spa like crazy places that tries to upsell you on everything (like gum treatments and tooth lightening), this is the place.  PS: I didn't see any of that stuff offices put in for kids in the waiting area, so I don't think its really a kids kinda place. Even more reason for me to go.

This is no where near the same as the Gilbert location.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, because they didn't have the veggie one I get from the other location.  It came on a fairly dry crusty hoagie roll, with shredded iceburg lettuce, mayo (that I specifically asked not for), chicken, and some horrible pepper sauce. The sauce was not listed in the ingredients on the menu. It was not just hot, but tasted bad. I asked the person at the counter about it, they said they put it on all their sandwiches. Something they might want to mention on the menu.  It was pretty loud, and smelled greasy. The menu is not the same as the Gilbert location either. I was fairly disgusted by my food, so we didn't even bother with the custard.

Omg laulau. That really could be this whole post. It is one of the few things I miss from living in Hawaii. They only have it on saturdays, and call ahead to make sure they haven't run out. I had the platter, and ate the whole thing, which is not a good idea, because you will explode from being so full.  The atmosphere is pretty low key, and I absolutely LOVE that this is a real hawaiian place, not some asian fusion, we put a pineapple in it so its hawaiian wannabe place.   On top of the absolutely awesome laulau, they have hawaiian specialty take home stuff, I got a frozen bit of kulolo which I can't wait to steam and enjoy. They also have poi, but I've never gotten into the stuff.   Oh, and canned guava juice like I used to get in hawaii too, like biting into a real guava.  I was in hawaiian heaven, a pleasant reminiscence of when I lived there.

I've been going here for more than ten years. Its gone down in time, it used to be amazing, now its just pretty good.  We live on the west side now, so its always a treat when we end up on this side of town to eat here for lunch. Its generally pretty quiet, to the point that we're usually the only ones there.   I get the vegetarian sandwich, and my girlfriend gets the pastrami. I love mine, sprouts, lettuce, avacado, and cream cheese. She said the pastrami was pretty good, not the best she's ever had, but still better than average. Their custards are still a good selection. The service was OK, the teenagers there were a bit slow, especially the boy working who was completely apathetic and lacked any personality.  I miss that they used to offer a variety of breads to choose from for your sandwich, now its all hoagie rolls. The no longer offer iced tea as a drink option either, which is just strange. This sucks if you don't drink soda.

I unfortunately have to go to the ER at least once a month due to severe migraines. The doctors and physicians assistants are quick as possible and get me the right medicines. I've rarely spent more than 2 hours here, and only had a handful of bad incidences (involving nurses who don't listen to me: "if you give me that medicine without an antinausea, I will vomit"). I like the quick rooms (for non trauma) which are quieter and have adjustable lighting that helps during my migraine treatment  much better than the rooms with the uncomfortable gurneys. They have these rolling recliners, it feels less hospitaly, which is probably why its less stressful.   They also limit to one visitor per bedside (which is mostly adhered to), so no running around kids and screaming babies.   The only reasons it doesn't get five stars are the times when I've had rude nurses who act like they're doing some kind of charity when they're doing their job, and the ones who decide they know my body better than I do (four years of daily migraines, but hey, if they want to wear vomit, its their choice). I also had to visit family in the regular part of the hospital once (I've never been admitted to any part other than ER), and the waiting room was packed. Children everywhere, people sitting on floors, it was awful. There was that gross smell from just too many people in one tiny waiting room because of visiting hours being so restricted. Actually, that part reminded me of a bus station.   If The Walking Dead is on while you're there (TV's in the quick rooms), people seem to be in a better mood when they come in to help you or who ever your roommate is on the other side of the curtain.   PS: My partner of 6 yrs takes me there every time. Everyone is nice, helpful, and she has never been banned from my bedside or treated rudely because of our sexual orientation.

I love this place!   I have white blond eyebrows and eyelashes, and finding a salon that can dye them the correct colors without making a mess of things is difficult at best.  When I explained exactly what I needed the girl who did my tinting (sadly I can't remember her name, but she was super awesome and nice!) got it exactly right. I will be back here every 6 weeks!  edit: the person I saw was Laura

I've been to greek places all up and down the west coast, and this is my favourite for Arizona!  We started with the Saganaki Flambeau, brought to our table by George (the owner, lol). So yummy, spicier than I am used to, but irresistible! The basket of pita and seasoned bread was great. The pita was still warm and fluffy. Its not Stefano's (greek place in Vancouver, BC) fluffy pita bread, but still great.   We both had the chicken souvlaki. One thing I appreciated was that they take the chicken off the kabob before bringing it to you. Its a nice touch that makes dinner easier and less messy. Perfect seasoning, juicy, I literally said, "Omg I want to have sex with this food".   I could eat that tsatziki all by itself. It was flat out amazing, the best I have ever had, anywhere, ever. Omg, just thinking about it is making me crave it.   The veggies on the side were not the usual lemon flavoured ones, but these had been cooked in what seemed like cinnamon and nutmeg. It was unexpected and tasty.   We were there pretty late, and the last table there. They changed the music from the greek music to classic rock, we had a great time jamming out at our table as we ate.   Lastly, we talked to George a few minutes, and on our way out he offered me a free shot of Ouzo. We didn't get to have their baklava (which I heard was awesome) because my girlfriend is allergic to walnuts. The ouzo was a perfect finish to the meal, and George is hilarious.   Love this place!!!

If I wanted to hang out in a snotty bar I would go to scottsdale.   45 minutes outside in line, another 45 in the little "holding room" that you stand and wait in with some whorey bartender, poorly made drinks, and a porno couch and plasma tv. (btw, theres no bathroom in this area, and they won't let you into the main bar if you do need to go). The main part of the bar was about 25% full (they showed the other room on the tv in the holding room).   I never made it past the velvet rope and into the main part of the bar, I got impatient and went to the Cash Inn instead.   This bar was awesome two years ago, now it sucks.

I LOVE this place. Theres a few reasons. First, the baked penne is amazing. Its like cheese with cheese on top, cheese in the middle, its cheesetastic (unless you're lactose intolerant). Its a large portion, I usually have some for dinner and the rest for lunch the next day.  My girlfriend loves the calzones, they're big and she always is stuffed.  The bread that comes with the penne is so delicious, I could eat just that. Its warm and soft, doesn't need anything, perfect.   We usually order to go, the atmosphere there is nice, but I like to eat at home usually.   Yesterday we ordered to go, got home and found out our order of lasagna was missing. We were about to sit down to eat, so we just decided to split the penne and get a refund for the lasagna after dinner. I called the restaurant and they offered to give me a credit for the next time we were there plus dessert, or we could get a refund. I agreed to the credit, we eat there often enough. A few minutes later they call back, they offered to DELIVER the lasagna to us (they don't deliver). Ten minutes later our food was at our house, by one of the owners I'm pretty sure, along with two free cannelloni! They were so delicious and fresh! They really went above and beyond.  This place is awesome!!

Do not take an animal here if you want the employees to show any measure of concern for its welfare. Favourite quotes from our visit:   Me: is she giving birth or has she had the puppies? If so we'd like to look for them Nurse (we'll call her Bad Dye Job): "ugh, why?" With grimace of disgust on her face.  Me: "I'm checking with our rescue if we can take her" get on my phone Bad Dye Job: talking over me as I talk and as I get on my phone, loud and nasty tone "we need to know who's taking responsibility for this dog, we can't just give out information. She's our dog now, she belongs to us." Me: dirty look as I walk outside to talk to our rescue director about the dog.  We found a stray dog that obviously either was about to give birth or had already had puppies (couldn't feel babies in her but was acting like she was in lots of pain and moving her body like a dog about to give birth).  Searched the area for over an hour for puppies, the rescue we volunteer with requested we take her here for AHS to claim in the morning, unless we could possibly take her.  We were informed after we had released her to their care they could not tell us her condition due to OSHA regulations. Ok that's fine. Here's an idea though, when you say all that try not being such nasty useless b******. I hope the dog survives and they don't kill her for fun.  This is the second time I've been here, first was for a personal dog that ate a medication that I dropped. They treat people like idiots and are so rude it's amazing they work at all. (guess Burger King had too many personality requirements).

I've been to the phoenix Thai Rama several times, but since I've moved this location is closer to home. I've never eaten inside, only done take out. Both locations are awesome!  I always get the  Tohm Kah soup and Kattiam Pik Thai, both chicken, and very mild cause I'm a whimp. My girlfriend gets the Paht Priaw Wahn, which she loves. Its not that we don't want to try other items on the menu, but these are so amazing its hard to try anything else.   The soup is this strange buttery coconut mix that sounds like it wouldn't be good, but after the first time you try it, you'll start craving it, its an addiction. The Kattiam Pik Thai chicken is juicy, and the portions are overly generous, same as the soup. The sweet and sour paht priaw wahn with chicken is to quote my girlfriend "its delicious yummy and tasty, the chickens good, the sauce is good" shes eloquent, lol. But getting her to love a food other than cheeseburgers is amazing, so this must be pretty damn good.   Theres a little drive up window just like a drive through, and its great, don't have to wait inside all awkward, but careful, the food is so hot it sometimes melts through the styrofoam containers!

I had a molar break the day after christmas (2012). It was a bit painful, so instead of calling my regular dentist I called around to the first place that could fit me in.   It took 5 visits for my crown. That doesn't sound like much, except one of those was because the crown they ordered didn't fit, so they proceeded to drill it more, until it fit even less, and had to order a new crown.  After EVERY appointment I would spend the rest of the day (sometimes days) finding little bits of dental debris in my mouth, such as molding plastic, tooth bits, glue chunks, and excess plastic from my temporary crown.   My first visit, the dentist gave me my injections then left for half an hour, which by then the anesthetic had begun to wear off, so what did she do? More injections and another half hour break. This happened again, then she finally started drilling. I could still feel it, but I had given up. At her rate my tooth wouldn't have been done until the following christmas.   When I finally received my crown, it was placed, and I thought it felt odd. For the first month I tried to convince myself it was just my gums trying to get back into place. For the past 3 months I've realized I probably shouldn't be able to fit floss UNDER the crown. And guess what?? Today it came off while I was eating. Oh, and my jaw hurts constantly because of the crown.   I will be calling my old dentist asap, hopefully the temporary glue I have to get at walgreens will hold me over.   One more thing, this place is more expensive than other dentists. They managed to blow through all of my insurance allowance just taking care of this. To compare, my regular dentist pulled 2 wisdom teeth, gave me a cleaning, filled 3 cavities, and gave me a crown, and I still had insurance left over.

I got a coupon from them for a free oil change for my birthday. I called on Friday and set an appointment on Saturday for my 2006 Nissan Xterra.  We were running a little bit late, and they checked us in just fine. For some reason they set us as a drop off, it wasn't mentioned when I called. The guy was a little grumpy about that.  The location was nice, they have a very comfortable sitting area, plasma screen tv, and complimentary coffee. It also doesn't have that stinky auto mechanic smell (like tires and oil). The bathroom is nicer than most bathrooms in peoples houses even, which if you're going to be there a while is awesome.   Everything was really clean and they guys working the counter were very professional while we were waiting. We ended up waiting about an hour total. They did bring in our air filter to ask if we wanted it changed and gave us the amount it would be right then. I know most places ask to change your air filter, but this guy was nice and not pushy about it.   When we were done, they gave us a sheet with a couple other things wrong with our car. This is where they really stood out. We've taken our car for oil changes, and in the past 2 years no matter where we went (including the Nissan dealership), they've told us its leaking oil, but they don't know why or from where, and we would have to get a diagnostic. These guys told us exactly where the oil was coming from, and that our timing belt was bad (we already knew that, we're saving up for that mechanical horror). They were nice, not pushy about having anything done, and said we could call anytime to get an estimate for those things.   I was so impressed with how friendly mostly everyone was, and that unlike seemingly every mechanic on the planet, they didn't try to upsell us, make us buy crap we didn't need, and weren't pushy about anything. We will definitely be back here to get that other stuff done.   I only gave them four stars because of the initial grumpy guy and that we were set as a drop off when that was never brought up when I made the appointment.

We came in five mintes to close, which I know sucks for any business. We waited and waited, someone finally appeared from the back. She immediately told us they were closed (which they were by this point) and that she forgot to change the sign and lock the door. Whats great is that they had the pasteries we wanted, and would have paid for. Now they'll be throwing them out since its the end of day. Waste of food and crappy customer service. We're heading to an independent bakery now, hopefully they know how to even basically function.

After searching through reviews and various Groupon that had shady reviews, I finally found this place (thanks yelpers!). Our carpet and tile was disgusting thanks to the people we had rented our house to. I swear they never once mopped or cleaned the carpet in the 3 years they lived here, not to mention how much their gross children decided to decorate the carpets. We haven't even finished moving in, and our dogs were over excited by the carpet and relieved themselves on it several times. Ew.  I got a quote over the phone from the owner, and he explained about their cleaning products and process. I have terrible allergies and chemical sensitivity, so this sounded perfect. To clean the tile and carpet in my house I was quoted $300 (for about 1200sq ft), and they could be here the next day. I asked about extra costs for heavily soiled areas and pet stains, there are none.   They showed up on time today, and got right to work. They measured my house and it came out to more than the owner quoted me, but they said they stick to their quotes, so I was charged only the $300. They were not freaked out by my little dogs (since a few would not shut up). They moved the bed we hadn't had a chance to move yet, which I know most carpet cleaners will not do. It took about 2 hours for them to do everything, my tile looks brand new, and most of the carpet does too. A few stains and traffic areas would not come out, but I'm not surprised with how bad it looked before. Those areas are at least lighter in color than they were before, and the carpet piling looks better. The carpet is slightly damp, and there's a very very faint cleaner smell. Nothing has aggravated my allergies or sentivities, and I've been walking on the carpet barefoot since they left. Both guys were really nice and caring that we not hurt ourselves trying to rush to move the last few things.  This place is amazing.

I build custom furniture. I've been to lowes twice in the past week for two beds that I am making. Each time I've been to this lowes I've needed very specific building materials that I've seen at home depot.  I've gone to lowes because they're usually a little cheaper, and they have more decorative items. Unfortunately because of the increase of decorative items it seems theres not only enough room for adequate building materials, but adequate assistance as well.  Trip one: 6 2x4s, two stain ready shelves, 6 5x10 pieces of pine. I also needed 10 L brackets, at least three inches wide each. These are essential to the stability of the frame. I informed one of the guys at lowes, not only did he have no options other than an overly long, very thin L bracket, he insisted no other building supply/hardware store would carry one, and that I should buy the wrong one at their store, or go to the welding class at MCC and commission a student there to create several for me. These brackets are common in home building btw. Found them at home depot (for 83 cents each!)  Trip two: Ready to make the second headboard, I was looking for composite bender board. I needed about 6 12 foot pieces, but cut into six foot lengths to fit in the car. Found the boards ($6.12 ea.), found a very nice man to cut them for us. As he is cutting them, another lowes worker comes over, makes the man cutting them for us stop (halfway through) and tells us that this type of board cannot be cut on his (his??) saw, that it would ruin the blade (in a building supply store do you think they have replacement blades?), and that despite the sign that says several types of materials can be cut, including this, that we have to stop. We asked if they had another type of saw to cut them, he said no. We walked out.   We ended up at home depot down the street, not only did they have the correct board, in longer lengths, it was on clearance (sign said $2.06, but they ended up being a penny each!!), they cut them all for us for no cost, no questions asked.   Lowes is nice if you need a new ceiling fan (but not any parts to install it), and maybe some paint and lightbulbs. If you're actually making a project or doing some real home improvement, save yourself the trip, see the experts at home depot

I have to park my car under trees, so naturally, my car is covered in bird poop,  to the point where you might think I'm trying to be camoflaged, and you can't see the color of my car after a week.  Went here for the first time today. They laughed when they saw all the poop, and directed me to a "bug cleaning" station, where you can scrub your car down a bit before going through the washer.   Super nice cashier and helpers, they gave me a customer card (9th wash is free, and free wash on your bday). I will likely be getting a lot of free washes.   Paid for the $5 wash, very clean facility, the helper guy was nice enough to run over my car with a soap wash before I went into the machine to get off the extra poop I had missed. Machine worked great, fairly quiet for those type of auto washers. There are free vacuums on the side, I didn't use them, no time.  Awesome service, cheaper and works better than the car wash at the gas station next door.

My girlfriend has been wanting to try cuban food for a while, especially since she used to get cuban sandwiches in puerto rico and hasn't had a great one since.  We started with the Tostones. She said they were perfect. I've never had them before and I thought they were great. Salty, crisp on the outside, soft but firm on the inside. We ate the whole plate, which was probably a bad idea because they are more filling than they look!  She of course had the cuban sandwhich, with mariquitas on the side. She says the sandwhich very "yummy, deliciousy, and fantastic". Exactly how they make them at El Mason in Puerto Rico.  I had the Pan Con Bistec, no mayo. They aren't lying on the menu when they say delicious steak. It was amazing. Oh and the plate was gigantic. I barely ate half of it and I'm having the rest for lunch tomorrow (unless I can't resist and eat it for dinner tonight!). Big slices of tomato, sauteed onions, fresh fluffy bread, just plain awesome. I regret that I got french fries on the side, they were good, but I tried my girlfriends mariquitas and they were so delicious, I wish I had gotten those instead.   We were too full for dessert, but hopefully next time!   We live in west phoenix and this place is totally worth the drive for us!!

We bought our car from this dealership, along with a very extensive warranty. The warranty covers pretty much everything under the hood and the interior. A couple of weeks after we bought our car (2010 Nissan Versa), the air conditioner started making a clicking noise and working at about half power. We called and made an appointment to the service department.  When we got there, the person (whose name I can't remember, sorry), took our info and told us to wait in their waiting area. When he came back he said we needed a new air conditioner blower motor, and they had one in stock. We told him about our warranty, which we brought with us, which details every single part it covers. Without looking at it he told us the warranty didn't cover the part. We looked up the part on the paperwork, and showed him the warranty did in fact cover the part. He then told us they didn't have the part in stock and he would have to order it, and it would take 7 to 10 business days just to order it, and they would call us when it was ordered. We said fine, thinking maybe the warranty specifies use of a certain brand or something.   Its been about 3 weeks, we haven't received a call. I called the service department today. The person I spoke to said that he doesn't know who we spoke to, and that our account only shows when we bought the car, no order for parts, not even the service appointment we had. He also directed that I will need to call back on Monday, since he doesn't know anything about whats going on or who was helping us. He then gave me a phone number, and the name of the service manager. He then referred to me as someone else "so the last name is Mata right?", which I said no, gave him the correct info again, and he still said he didn't know what was going on. He gave me the service managers name again and now a different phone number to call. No apologies, asked what was wrong with the car, after I told him the specific part we needed, and that it was covered under warranty, again. His response was that he didn't know what was going on, and maybe someone just didn't put our info in, but that the part wasn't ordered.  Every time we mention the part is covered under our warranty, the service people get irritated, and suddenly don't have any way to help us. I guess we'll see what happens on Monday.

I had heard from a few people that this was a pretty decent, especially if you are in the area, since Zen 32 is long gone.   I went here for a quick takeout, a rainbow roll and two avacado rolls. I was told 15 minutes. I waited in my car out front and read a little. I went in 20 minutes later, still not ready. This was the middle of the afternoon and the place was dead. I ended up waiting 45 mins for my takeout, I could have just gone home and made dinner at that point. A manager was even standing there during all of this and didn't say a thing.  The rolls themselves were ok, nothing spectacular. Whitefish can be difficult, I understand that, but this was a sad grey, about room temp, and not very good. The rest was ok.   I won't be bothering with this place again. In all honesty, RA has better sushi, and thats sad.

Some of the best sushi I have EVER had, including various places in Vancouver and California. I ordered takeout, so I can't say for the dining experience.  I ordered the gyoza, a caterpillar roll, rainbow roll, and avacado roll. The gyoza was delicious, not soggy from its Styrofoam packaging to my house, which is a real feat. It had just a bit of kick to it, enough for my very white person taste beds to freak out at first, lol.  The caterpillar roll was really the star of the show here. Normally it's my second fave, with the rainbow being to top of my list. Today was a shocker. This is by far the best caterpillar roll ever. The insides were CRISPY! The sauce was used to absolute perfection, not a drop too much. Too many times have I eaten this roll drenched in sauce to the point of total mushyness, where you could not taste the individual flavours. This was amazing. This was one of the many times I have been happy my wife hates sushi, there was no way I would have shared!  The rainbow roll was delicious, the fish selections all very fresh and the crab insides flavourful and firm. It seemed a tad larger than the same roll from some other restaurants. One slice in particular was so large I barely fit it in my mouth. Not saying that's a bad thing, the more generous with the salmon and tuna the better! The same exceptional quality can be said for my avacado roll, the only thing I could have asked for on that is sesame seeds, but that's a personal preference.   I only knocked a star because I called at 9:30pm, and they only agreed to take my order because I live down the street and could be there in a few minutes. They apparently were closing early because they were slow (they were supposed to be open till 11). I get frustrated at businesses that don't stick to their posted operating hours. When my wife went to pick my food up they even had already closed up, ten minutes after my call.

After practically running out of Twin Peaks (in the same plaza), we tried this place instead. We loved it.   If you had to compare it to something, the closest I'd say is Paradise Bakery. Differences: large and creative dessert selection, better soup selections too. The desserts aren't bakery style, most of the offerings were brulee, mousse, and fruit tarts. It has more lighting and modern feel to it as well.   The sandwich offerings are pretty similar. The only reason I gave it four stars is the turkey cranberry sandwich I had was great, but the cucumber on it made a bit of an odd combination. Also the chocolate hazelnut brulee was more like a mousse, but still delicious (and very rich).  It was pretty slow most of while we were there, the staff were very friendly and everything was clean. We're looking forward to eating here again.

I went here in October (sorry for the late review!). I can be a pain when it comes to my sushi order, because I don't like roe, or the california roll stuffing thats pretty standard for many different rolls.  I ordered an avacado roll, cucumber roll, rainbow roll, and I asked if they had sweet potato or yam and they said they did (on the phone). We got this all take out, the service was friendly, but it was pretty busy, so not super fast, which is to be expected.  I got the two veggie rolls, they did not have sweet potato at all, and the cost to make a rainbow roll would have been around $30 or more so I didn't get it.   All of the roll fillings are a la carte, so the more you want, the more expensive it gets. Sadly, the rice was also so overdone it was more like a paste, and had way too much rice vinegar. I could barely eat two rolls before it was just too much for me to handle. The rolls were gigantic though. My eyes were bigger than my stomach, which sucks because sushi does not keep well.   By the way, if you ever come across a place that serves sweet potato rolls, esp tempura ones, get them. They are absolutely amazing. I've only found them in Vancouver, BC.

This review is just about Laura:  I have white blond eyebrows and eyelashes, and finding a salon that can dye them the correct colors without making a mess of things is difficult at best.  When I explained exactly what I needed Laura got it exactly right.

My girlfriend and I have both been going here since August 2009. We get physical therapy, trigger point massage, and our adjustments. We see Dr. Bryson.   What I love: Its clean, theres a big TV to watch while you do your therapy, and all the massage girls are super nice. Theres hardly any waiting usually. We can make our appointment within an hour of needing to be there and they have space for us. You get a free massage when you refer a friend too. Kristi is my favourite massage therapist. She is amazing. AMAZING. I get horrible migraines and she gives this awesome scalp massage that makes the migraine go away. Bonnie is also great too.  We can ask Dr. Bryson about pain issues we're having out of the normal, like my girlfriends knee hurting, or my sinuses being sore, and she will work on those too. Everyone is so friendly!  What I don't like: Lots of clients bring their kids, and the kids just kind of run around, and everyone seems ok with it. This drives me insane, especially when I'm trying to do my stretches and the kids are playing on the machines.

Were here around 8:30am on a Wednesday. Not too busy at all, and the food was pretty good. I ordered the blueberry lemon marscapone pancake, it was so big it hung off the plate. Apparently they have an even larger pancake called Moms, I don't know who would order it unless it was for several people to share. Mine was delicious and over half of it is in my fridge for tomorrow and maybe the rest of the week. My wife had the crisp French toast, and that was really amazing too. Crispy and sweet, not flat and oily like some places French toast. Her side of fried potatoes (red potatoes!) was cooked in bacon grease like her mom used to, yum!  The only loss of a star is for hot tea the only option was regular black tea. I love a cup of earl grey or English breakfast in the morning.   Staff was friendly and attentive. Their decor had their own kitschy vibe that even had a few pieces for sale, nice to see their supporting local artists instead of your run of the mill "same weird stuff on walls" like some places.

I've been getting acupuncture and chinese herbs for my migraines for a couple months now from Perry. I'm sleeping better and my migraines while still around are much less intense. I've gone from having twice monthly ER visits for migraines to no ER visits, so thats a pretty good improvement. I was worried at first we wouldn't be able to afford the treatments, but its so much less than I expected and with these results, much more affordable than going to the ER and doctor all the time.   Everyone is super nice, we're able to get appointments later which is great so very little work gets missed. The no scent policy is appreciated too.   Everything is clean and modern, and very comfortable.   I also love Heather the receptionists photography that is featured all over the place.

Walking around county looking at dogs and I came across a little white mom dog and her fluffy puppies. All the puppies had red collars on, the mom did not. When I asked a shelter worker about a couple of the puppies they said they had to be adopted through Halo, who would be taking care of them. The mom had no red tag, so Halo did not want her? Is this a regular practice of theirs, to take puppies and let the mom dog get euthanized? If so you might as well be petland. I'll stick with AHS or a REAL rescue. Disgusting.

This is not about the food or drinks, because we didn't eat. Its about the theme, atmosphere, and employees.  We were hungry and looking for a place to eat in this area. I should have looked it up first, but I was enticed by the silly giant deer statue by the patio.   I was confused by the sign that offered a "scenic view" in the middle of a shopping center in Phoenix. As we parked, two large men, one looking like some sort of mafia bouncer, and another male employee were outside kind of yelling back and forth and swearing. My first thought was "wow, it looks like going into a strip club". And I was sort of right. Its like a lumberjack themed hooters.   The hostess was nice, lots of makeup, less of anything resembling clothing, because the women there are strippers with serving trays. (Except strippers make better money and don't get treated as shitty). We looked over the menu, and there was not an appealing option there. The food selection is limited, probably because most people go to drink and grope coeds.   Everyone male there looked crazy happy, and few women customers looked miserable. We waited a few minutes at our table and decided not to stay. It was too uncomfortable, we felt out of place, and the food options sucked. The managers or bouncers or whatever they were had this skeezy attitude when we walked by them. The waitresses and hostesses looked shocked that two women come in by themselves (since there weren't men there to convince us its "because of the food"). I felt a little bad leaving like that, I've worked at restaurants, I know what a pain it is when customers just up and leave, but if I want to pay for nearly naked women I'll go to a strip club.

Went here because they discontinued a bra that I really like. I called ahead and the woman who answered was rude, telling me they were really busy but she would try to look. She came back and said they did not have it.  Since she sounded like she did not really bother to look we drove out anyway. Surprise surprise, they had it, but not in a color I liked. While I was looking, that same clerk managed to boisterously greet everyone in the store and give them some scratch off ticket. Somehow my partner and I were completely ignored, even at one point when I was standing just a few feet from her. It wasn't until I went to the dressing room that another clerk, very friendly with a Spanish accent, was nice, helpful, and even checked other stores for me for the bra I was looking for. She was great. The other woman was not. Not sure if it was that she's homophobic or what, but I'll be checking out torrid instead next time I need to shop around here. Maybe I just don't look important enough to shop there. Or straight enough.

We adopted two dogs from Mini Mighty Mutts. Both dogs we love very much. They had some medical issues that the rescue handled before adoption. Considering that, plus they were both spayed and neutered, had their shots, and microchipped,  the adoption fee is very reasonable.  Also they did a home visit to make sure the dogs got along with our other dogs and cats. So much better than just bringing a dog home only to find out it hates cats or is not housetrained! The whole group has been helpful when we had training questions. One of he best small dog rescues in Arizona.

The food was great, service was super friendly, I enjoyed the little nerdy nods (the elements on the wall, certain food names).   Went here with my partner, her dad and step mom. We got there about ten minutes after them and they already had drinks and the roasted red pepper hummus. The flat bread with it was good, and I really liked the hummus, but didn't detect a hint of red pepper.  For food: I got the Flux Capacitor with waffle fries. The patty was big, almost over the sides of the bun, with about medium thickness. It was very juicy, and thankfully still a bit pink in the middle (ordering beef well done is just living life wrong). The waffle fries with it were awesome, finally, somewhere is able to make good waffle fries!  My girlfriend got the bacon cheese burger. According to her is was juicy and yummy. It had an appropriate amount of bacon to cover the burger and that it was not too crispy (though she does say nothing can ever have enough bacon). The was quite a bit of very melted cheddar, which she loved as well. She ordered regular fries.   The family ordered the steak sliders with onion rings (I had an onion ring, I'd give it about three stars) and a BAT with french onion soup. Neither could finish theirs and took the rest home, so I guess that says they were pretty good, but thats the best details I have there.   While our server was super friendly, the wait time between our drinks and food was about  45 minutes. She did stop and check on us a few times, and let us know the food would be out soon. The food was hot when we got it, but not sure why it took so long. The place wasn't full, and it was 7pm on a Saturday.   For drinks we all had domestic beers, so I can't say much about their drink menu. I wish restaurants would let you know their iced tea is the passion flavour and not just  regular brewed iced tea. Maybe its a way to sell drinks, so  you can get that awful taste out of our mouth.  Table was cleared super quick, and we were offered some cheesecake in a mason jar. It looked good, and you could take it home if you were too full, but we were on the way to the movies. Perhaps another time!

Went here for dinner with my wife and in laws. The food was amazing, as was the service (our server was Dennis, very funny and helpful).  Combo appetizer platter with eggplant, chicken, hummus, and chicken samosas. Everything was delicious. The samosas are flatter than traditional Indian ones, and did not have the full heavy filling, these were mostly chicken with some shredded carrot. Still very good.  We all shared the Pleaser dinner. It was HUGE. Two kinds of rice, 5 types of meat, 2 types of Naan, and salad. We were stuffed and still have plenty of rice, salad, and naan to take home. Everything is well seasoned, with a nice variety of spice.   The iced tea was also a wonderful surprise, back tea with cardamom. I will have to figure out how to make that at home.

Called before driving over to see if they had a series I am looking for. I have called 3 other stores who had never even heard of it and placed me on hold, so I expected the same. When I asked, the guy who answered immediately said they didn't have it, not a single book from that series, and was not friendly to speak to. He didn't take a moment to look on a computer, nothing. I find it very hard to believe that he has their entire stock memorized unless they only sell marvel or dc. If that's the case, what a boring store.   Only gave 2 stars because he saved me a drive.

At first I thought we walked into the wrong door, standing directly in the kitchen. The owner was super nice, explained that they're take away and catering. I ordered the peril and mufungo, my girlfriend had the Carne fritas and mufungo. We also got an order of pastelillos. We talked to the owner for a while, he cooked while my girlfriend and I discussed our upcoming wedding. We were still talking about catering when we asked him what he does as far as catering. He gave us tiny samples of the beef and chicken stew (amazing), and I ordered one of the cream cheese pastries (also delicious).  His catering options and pricing are so impressive, we are definitely hiring him for our wedding.   It was way too hot to eat at the outside seating, so we headed home. The pastelillos were huge and so filling I couldn't eat meal till the next day, and it was still impressive. My girlfriend was able to dig into her food then, thrilled with everything. It's easily as good as the food her family from Puerto Rico makes, which is really like a ten star rating.

Super super friendly and knowledgeable! She helped my wife and I pick out grain free treats to hide our dogs medication in. Lots of selection, and grain free soft treats, which are pretty hard to find.  We will definitely be back!
