I'm a loyal hertz customer and rent about a dozen cars per year. I am never impressed with this location. I have had more reservation snafus and high mileage, dirty cars here than any other location including countries where English is a second language!  This time the biggest issue is that it is Spring Break for many families and PHX is quite busy. You would think that any travel related business would take that into account and staff up accordingly but not here at Hertz PHX. See my photo. Lines to exit are jammed and long. There are 6-7 exit lanes. Only 2 were staffed and all others closed so they creates a huge bottleneck o exit the lot. 24 min just to exit the rental car lot. Very, very lame.

This place makes my short list of great ethnic restaurants. I get to Scottsdale frequently and this is my 2nd visit to the Persian Room. I will definitely be coming back. I am not an expert on food from this culture but I know what I like. So far, nothing here has disappointed.   The service is friendly, helpful, polite and has just the right amount of guidance for people like me that are not that familiar with this type of food. We were served by Nico and she was right on with her suggestions. She represents the front of the house very well and my group felt welcome and well attended to by her. The menu is almost overwhelming because of all the choices but everything I tasted was delicious. Hummus and Stuffed Grape Leaves were a couple of favorites as was the house-made flat bread that comes straight out of their oven to the table. The Koobideh and the Chicken Barg were some mains that are recommended and a word to the wise...the portions are quite large. Surprisingly so given the reasonable prices for ethnic authenticity.   This is not fancy, fine dining but it does get 5 stars from me because it has the total package: Great front-house staff, great food, and great execution of the entire meal. Anyone that does not enjoy themselves here either is a food coward or needs to be on anti-depressants. Looking forward already to my next visit!

Found it by accident while on vacation with the family. Gave it a shot based on location close to our hotel and that the menu seemed to have several things on it that my family would be interested in. We were not diappointed.  SETTING: Old school supper club feel. Private parking lot with a secret pizza takeout in the back. Don't let the dim lighting dissuade you. There are rewards for those that pass through the front door. The dining room is wide open, noisy when busy, semivisible kitchen and a full bar with a TV going. Reminds me of a family friendly joint with a casual feel but the lighting is dim enough to cast it in a date-night aura if need be. Several of the staff have NY Italian accents that only creates authenticity ad interest. To be honest, it is not going to be awarded stars for ambience or an ultra-romantic setting. It does get stars from me for giving off a vintage homey feel in a clean setting. The dining room was full with multiple turnovers during my Saturday night visit. . .the clientele clearly local and with several blue-haired couples and familes celebrating birthdays.  SERVICE: Friendly, prompt, knowledgable. Willing to work with special orders and requests. Water glass never empty. No complaints. Chef Aiello was in the house and dropped by several times to see that we were being taken care of. The end of the meal guessing game that others have described is also great fun. We certainly felt wecome and had an enjoyable time. THE FOOD:  I give them a nod for going above and beyond easy to find Italian food. There are many places that can serve standard red sauce on pasta. This place certainly does that and authentically recognizes it as "Sunday Gravy" but it also puts some effort into items that are not always as easy to find in run of the mill Italian chains. Scungilli is a standard offering here and Osso Buco was a special during my visit. While the food was a little heavy on the EVOO, it was also heavy on the whole roasted garlic and the flavors. . .just my family's style. Also a nod to the reasonable variety on the wine list, heaviest on Italian imports and with price ranges to fit most budgets. Wine snobs will criticize the lack of classic, high end offerings and generic stemware but I found it to be right in the sweet spot of what this place was offering. . .Good food and a welcoming atmosphere at reasonable pricing that can appeal to a wide range of palates. SUMMARY: It hits my list of places worthy of return visits and that is probably the highest compliment I can give a restaurant. It will not be in the 5-star zone of fine dining but it hits all the important aspects of a meal out and then some.

Having been to a few of these Brazilian style meat-sweat dinners, I've come to love that you can eat at these places like an upscale caveman. Continuously arriving charred proteins are a thing of beauty but, it doesn't come cheap. And as great as it is to be able to leave in a paleo-induced coma, what really disappointed me here was the lack of attention to detail. The meal alone will set you back about $50/person before tip, drinks, wine, dessert, etc. Throwing all of that in, it is easy to run a tab closer to about $100/person. For that, I expect a little more than just a meat fest. My biggest gripe is that for a place that earns a large dollar amount per person, I would think they could put a little more thought into their wine program. The list comes in a heavy leather-bound cover which is promising until you open it and read mainly mainstream, easily recognized names and labels. Also, none of them have vintage dates next to the choices so you have no idea what year you could actually get. This results in anyone who is the least bit interested in vintages to have to ask the staff. In doing so, I found out that the staff really has no clue about wine and they had to go to the cellar to sequentially check each one. 2 of the labels I inquired about they did not even have any more of in stock. The 3rd choice I inquired about was a year that was horrendous. Each time I made an inquiry, the server disappeared for about 5-10 minutes to check on it so by the time I made my 4th inquiry, I was about 30 min into this process and ready to drink Chateau du Shit if that was all they could produce. The fact that they have fairly mainstream labels, they don't list vintage years, they don't seem to put a lot of training time into their wine program with their staff, and they don't seem to keep their lists up to date with what they do and do no have in stock make me really question their commitment to the wine aspect of the meal. In many places, this is not a huge deal to me but when you are spending about $100/person, I expect the entire meal experience including the wine to be pretty darn good. While the meat was plentiful and tasty, the wine program sucked and the tab was pricey which is why I can't go more than 2 stars for this visit. I'll go again because I like to take down animals en masse as much as the next person but next time I think I'm going to stick to water.

Absolute affordable bliss. I've seen a negative review on this site and similar negative reviews on other sites of this place. I did not find those to be accurate. The comments I have read make me wonder if the customers that went here had the wrong expectation. My experience with numerous traditional reflexology places in Asia and the large Chinatowns of the US and Australia support that this place rocks when it comes to delivery of reflexology service.   First, it is NOT a traditional, white-bread "day spa". It is a therapy place steeped in Eastern Medical treatment cultures. If you go here expecting the staffers to be plasticized Barbie Dolls or concerned about touchy-feely things such as cosmetics or aromatherapy, you will be disappointed if not downright shocked. The staff is old-school Chinese, right down to their communist-era leisure suit uniforms.   Second, for $35 I received a full body massage with clothing on and special concentration on my feet for 60 minutes. That is a downright bargain. The strokes and techniques used are semi-rough and stimulating. This is not Swedish style baby strokes. It doesn't hurt but you do know you are being kneaded and you walk out feeling like a new person. If your idea of a massage is someone barely stroking your skin, you will not appreciate this.   Lastly, I have rarely received massage of my back and neck with a reflexology treatment. It is usually limited only to my feet and lower legs. The extra areas covered are a pure bonus and totally worth the price paid. No, you are not on a traditional flat massage table but then again, this is not a traditional massage that most people are used to.   I would encourage others to go here with an open mind and look forward to experiencing a massage based on Asian medical teachings. 2 thumbs up to this place in my book.
