Myself and a group of coworkers decided to come here for lunch. We even called ahead to make sure that it wouldn't be too busy. The hostess assured us that they would be able to accommodate our group of 8 for a quick meal as long as it wasn't busy.   We arrived at 12:10. The restaurant is less than half full... We are quickly seated. First I want to say that the place smells. Like an old grandma closet. Mothballs? Dirty antiques? I don't know. But not an appetizing smell.   It took 10 minutes for our server to even greet the group. When she finally makes her way to the table she lets us know she has to check on another table first and then she'll Be "right over". What a gem. Her name is Shantih.   We immediately placed orders for food and drinks (waters, iced teas soups salads sandwiches..simple order). We explained that we needed eat quickly and return to work. Shantih seemed to understand that concept.   15 to 20 minutes pass (No, this is not an exaggeration) and drinks have yet to be delivered to the table...and it appears that Shantih has vanished, as other tables surrounding us are looking around frantically for her. We kindly ask another server to check on our orders, reiterating that we need to return to work within the hour.   Several minutes later our server arrives with our salads, soups and drinks. (Drink order came back incorrect) Great. At this point it's clear that we won't have time to eat our meal in the restaurant, so we ask if we can get our checks and to go boxes...  Shantih is extremely rude and short with us. Even interrupting my coworker to explain she will get our checks and boxes when she has time. Never once is there an apology offered or even an explanation as to why it takes 20 minutes for drinks...close to 35 minutes for food. Oh but she did leave us with a half- sincere "Sorry it took longer than you were expecting". Wow.   We paid our bills (which were split incorrectly) and left with our food in boxes, which I might add, was mediocre at best. One of the  worst dining experiences I've ever had. We won't be returning.

I initially chose to rent through another company. Come delivery day, they flaked on me and I was out a few tables, 30 chairs and $150 dollars. Total nightmare.   Cut to my call to Classic Party Rental: They were able to fill my order that same day for close to $50 less than the other rental place. The delivery guys were professional and friendly, and I didn't have to lift a finger in terms of set up or tear down. This place saved me from potentially having pic-nic style Thanksgiving dinner! I'll never trust another rental company!

I can't believe I am the first person to review this guy! He's located in a small strip mall near the freeway. Conveniently located. Anyway, my parents have been going to Ed for a while now for repairs on shoes, purses and belts. I received a Michael Khors bag as a gift for Christmas and the shoulder strap was too long. This man sat with me and went over 3 to 4 possible solutions on how we could shorten the strap. (Yes apparently there are THAT many options). In all seriousness, I appreciated him taking the time to explain how everything would work and what it would ultimately end up looking like. This purse is important to me and it was important to Ed that I was pleased with the final result. He's reasonably priced too! $10 to fix my bag.   He does wonders with scuffed leather shoes, boots, etc. I will definitely be returning and referring!

My husband and I stayed here this past weekend for a Staycation. We had a great experience! The room was clean with a view of the golf course. We arrived a few hours early to our scheduled check-in time and they already had a room available for us (awesome!) our baggage was delivered to our room within minutes of our arrival. Valet and front desk staff were so friendly and filled us in on the amenities available to us at the resort.   Loved the two different pools (one family friendly and one adult only) we took advantage of both. Pool service was quick, food was delicious and servers were friendly.   Requests to the service desk for extra towels, toiletries and a larger ice bucket were met in 10 minutes or less--faster than most resorts we have stayed at! Literally the only criticism I can think of is the outdated rooms. This resort needs to update the guest rooms. Though clean and comfortable, they just don't go with the open modern feel of the lobby or resort grounds.   We loved the close proximity to the Scottsdale quarter. Plenty of dining options and activities for the evening hours. We will definitely be back!

Stopped here to pick up a gift card and a coffee on my lunch break and I have to say, I was majorly (and pleasantly) surprised!   It's a coffee bar. Like literally a coffee shop WITH a full bar. Ample seating/ lounge space, unique and comfortable decor, welcoming staff and quick service.   Yes, Lux appears to be a trendy haven for hipsters and pretentious d-bags...but that couldn't be further from the truth. The crowd is a mixed bag of students, working professionals, old yogis and kids. (All of which I saw within my 10 minute visit). The only negative part of my experience was leaving to go back to work.   Most important: The coffee is good and refills are free.

I love this restaurant! Food is delicious and service is quick and friendly. Some favorite dishes are the tom kha soup, chicken Panang, and yellow curry. The portions are large enough to share and are customizable with your choice of meat and spice level.   I would give this restaurant 5 stars, except they NEVER answer their phone. Many times my husband and I have called to order dinner (to go) and the phone just rings off the hook! Very aggravating! We would order out more often if they had a reliable to-go system.   Other than that, highly recommended!

I ordered around 30 chairs and additional tables for Thanksgiving (yes, quite a large group) from Evelyn. She even arranged to have the items delivered AND picked up. Awesome! I was told that all Thanksgiving orders would be delivered on Monday or Tuesday--better yet, Evelyn offered me my preference.  "Monday!" I replied, earlier the better right?!   Unfortunately when I called on Monday I was told my delivery would not make it until at least Tuesday or Wednesday. Naturally, I asked to speak to a manager regarding my order.   The woman I spoke to (Marla) was immediately defensive and condescending. Not offering any type of resolution, but instead lecturing me on the logistics of how product delivery works and pointing out that I should be 'happy' to receive a Tuesday delivery since Thanksgiving  wasn't until Thursday.  She even CANCELLED the pick up of my items telling me that I would need to return them myself. Wow. I told her to cancel my order entirely.   Surprisingly, that is not the end of this review, one that I wasn't going to write until this morning, when Andrew's Party rental charged me for my order...For a service they never provided. Don't be fooled by their high ratings like I was. I've never felt so mistreated by a business. I am not the first person to experience this. Read the filtered reviews. Do research on other websites! There are more customers with similar stories.   Do yourself a favor and go through a legitimate rental company.

We decided to try AZ Wilderness Brewing Co to switch up our regular Saturday night. We invited another couple for dinner and drinks. The place was packed (as expected for a Saturday night) so we put our name in for a table and headed to the bar.  The bar staff was attentive and friendly, even offering samples of their offerings on tap.   We were seated within 20 minutes...patio is spacious and here's plus, you can bring your pet! Food is solid and service was perfectly timed. Amazing appetizers (meatloaf sliders and artichoke dip) and Rosemary fries that will make you weak in the knees. We enjoyed several hours on this patio catching up with our friends. We will absolutely return, a favorite spot to add to our list!

Literally nothing is worse than trying to figure out how to entertain a group of family members who range in age from 14-60. That's why Top Golf has just made my life infinitely easier.   The vibe is fun and updated with comfortable seating and several strategically placed TVs. There is a full bar to cater to the older crowd and the indoor/ outdoor atmosphere was a hit with our out-of-town guests from the Midwest. Who, obviously, want to soak up every last bit of the Arizona weather while they can.  Unfortunately, due to the sheer size of this place, service can be a bit...slow.   Of course, there's the golf. The game choices take the intimidation factor out of it, but can somehow still hold the interest of the more experienced golfer. Good times had by all! Won't hesitate returning.

My family and I have trusted Foothills Pet Resort with our furry family members for years! (My parents use the Ahwatukee location). Our dogs are groomed here regularly and always come home happy and looking adorable. We've also sent our dogs to stay here overnight without a worry, the facility is clean and comfortable and our animals are always well cared for.

New location to the same Yard you know and love. I do like this location better than the Phoenix one. Some improvements? Larger restaurant, TWO bars, and an additional lounge area with fire pits (fun in the winter). They also had some excellent musicians playing live which is always good. Ambiance was amazing...decor and design of the restaurant was impressive as I've come to expect from Fox restaurants. It's a bit too far away from Mill Avenue to be considered walking distance, but for me that was a plus.  Negatives? Beer selection was pretty limited. Lame. They really push the specialty cocktails, which is all fine and dandy, but sometimes a girl just wants a good amber-style beer. Is that too much to ask? (Yes, at The Yard, apparently it is.) Also, place closes on weekdays at 11, Saturdays at 1 and Sundays at 10. What is the point of shutting down before 2am? Doesn't make a ton of sense to me as you're marketed as a restaurant and BAR. That said, we had an overall good experience here and no doubt will return.
