I have been coming to Texanos since my freshman year at ASU, four years later I still love it! Its open 24/7 which is real convenient after late nights out on Mill. The staff is extremely nice and friendly also! I recommend the Carne Asada burrito (under 5 bucks) or the Juevos Ranchera. Much better then filabertos!

I was brought to munch a few years ago by a college friend and have been a fan ever since. The prices are pretty inexpensive and the owners Gordon and Mary are some of the nicest people I have met. I havent been there for about a month and they still remembered my name and asked where I have been. I get the chicken sandwich with bacon, avocado and ask for the "magic" sauce. There is tons of ASU memorabilia on the walls, mainly softball and baseball. If your ever in Tempe for lunch, this is the place to be.

I was looking for some pizza outside the corporate brands and found this place on yelp. I tried it out a few months ago and have been coming back ever since. I come here at least once or twice a week for their $3.50 two slice and small drink special. Toppings are an extra .50 each and I always add the italian sausage. The slices are pretty large are enough to fill me up. I have had the italian salad a few times as well and again, very large portion. I would make it a 5 if the women at the front were a little friendlier. They dont seem happy to be there.

I have been pretty addicted to this place the last few months and always seem to get a pizza or calzone at least twice a week. I'm a big fan of both the Chicago deep dish and thin crust when it comes to the pizzas. I have experienced pickup issues with the people on the back being on their cell phones when my pizza sat there ready to go.

Typical McDonalds, nothing special about this location and customer/employee interaction has room for development, I feel like the staff are robots. No smiling, no greetings at the drive thru windows, just the price at the first window and when I get my food at #2 just someone saying "Here!" and shoving it my way.

This place is great and has earned a spot in the office lunch rotation. There are so many different sandwich options with a number of sandwiches named after ASU and Arizona sports figures along with several SF Giants and other actors/athletes. It takes a few minutes for the food to come out, but well worth the wait. The last time I was there I ran into Ike himself who was kind enough to chat for a few minutes, take a picture, and hook me up with a free drink/chips coupon for my next visit. Which will be very soon.
