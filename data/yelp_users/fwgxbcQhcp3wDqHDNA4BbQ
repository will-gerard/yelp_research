My experiences here are always a little weird, but the food is great and I love the patio. :)

The fish is good and the service is friendly.  I suggest ordering rather light here because the typical roll is pretty big.    After moving out of the neighborhood 10 years ago, I almost completely forgot about this place.  Stopped in the other night and what a treat - three rolls for $22 - and we were stuffed!

My experience at Landis last weekend was far less than stellar.  Their customer service is very questionable, and they refused to fix my cruiser...until AFTER I had tipped one of the guys there for looking at it.  Let me give you the whole story...  On Saturday morning I called in at 9:04 AM (four minutes after they opened) and explained that I had a bike cruise later that afternoon and my bike needed just a little love after a past wreck - the front wheel wobbled.  The guy on the phone expressed that they do not schedule repairs for Saturdays because it is so busy, and that if I wanted to have my bike looked at I'd have to schedule for Monday through Friday.  Since the cruise was that day, I asked if they would be able to just take a look at it and repair if it's not a huge issue...because Monday would be far too late....and that I don't mind waiting a while, if they could fit it in between helping customers.  The guy (Tim? Tom?) agreed, said sure, bring it in.  So I did...  After arriving at the store 20 minutes later, a different guy came out of the back to talk to me.  His name was Eric and he gave me the whole speech again, told me how there's no way they could look at it today. I explained that the guy on the phone told me he would try to fit in in and told me to come down, or I wouldn't have.  After about 20 minutes of listening to him scold me about Saturday repairs, he finally agreed to put my bike on the "table" and look at it.  I thanked him profusely, gave them my phone number, and left.  Half an hour later I"m at breakfast with my friend and I get a text saying there is an issue with the fork and they cannot fix my bike for liability reasons.  So I go into the store after breakfast and talk with Eric.  He says they didn't get any further on my bike than noticing that the fork is bent, and that they cannot work on it...and that they CANNOT fix it.  I asked a couple different ways.  This is my $50 craigslist cruiser, and while it was a cheapy, I've had it for a couple years and I'm attached to it.  I asked what I could do with it.  "Throw it away.  We sell cruisers starting at $249."   Bummed out, I thanked him for at least looking at my bike.  They didn't charge me anything since they didn't actually do anything, so I tipped the guy $10.  "At least I can buy you lunch."  As I'm wheeling my bike out of the store, a guy calls from the back "We could order the fork."  What??  So my bike CAN be fixed??  Another guy comes out and measures the fork, tells the other guy what needs to be ordered.  They both say they can order the piece and it will be there in a week.  Eric is already off in another part of the store, ignoring me after having driven off any hopes of sales from me.  So this other guy says he will order the part.   In retrospect, here is my issue.  Every conversation I had with them was wrought with discomfort.  The first guy told me to throw my bike away, did not AT ALL care for my business (I guess because it was just a repair on what he considered a junk cruiser?  I don't know...) and they ONLY offered to help me AFTER I gave them money.    I called back 20 minutes later and told them not to bother ordering the part.  I'd like to go somewhere with my bike that actually appreciates me as a customer.

I SO love Dick's.  Thank goodness for punctuation, or that sentence would read a little differently. ;)  Their food is delicious.  They grill over pecan wood.  Their specials menu always has the most delicious items on it, like the NY Strip with fresh crab, hollandaise (which was amazing, normally I find this sauce lacking), and spicy chipotle sauce.  Well worth the money, for sure.  Most of the specials items are a little pricey (and well worth it!), so if you're looking for a less expensive alternative, go with the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer, as it's only about $15 and is definitely a full meal.    Be careful with the garlic appetizer.  While it's OUTSTANDING, the next day may be a little...windy. ;)  The wine list is great - several selections, and many are moderately priced (especially their happy hour specials).  And they have a good draft beer selection.    The service is always spot on.  The place is SUPER TINY and intimate, which I love, but also means that you need to walk in with a good attitude, knowing that you might need to wait a bit for a spot at the bar or one of the three little tables.  There is also a private room you can reserve, I believe, for dining with a bigger party.

This place is a winner!   Cheap, tasty, and Brandon is awesome!  At some point last year a friend and I stopped in and we weren't super impressed.  I've heard (from another friend) that since then the original owner bought the place back, the prices went down, and the quality went back up to what it originally was.  So a lunch buddy and I stopped in the other day. WOW!  Big difference from before.  For $5 I got a bacon cheeseburger, side of fries, and a can of Pepsi.  The guy behind the counter was friendly, knowledgeable, and super smiley.   He even brought the food out to us because we were on the back patio.  I'll totally hit this place up again! :)

There's something very comfortable and relaxing about tea and lunch in an apothecary, surrounded by crystals and soft colors, and people who are friendly and helpful.  This restaurant is changing a lot from the way it used to be.  I've noticed they have really pulled it together when it comes to the menu (a variety of amazing foods, farm-fresh to the table, etc.), the decor, and the overall service.  Feels like some new management - people who really care about the customer experience.  My favorite tea is the Roman Provence.  My favorite wrap is the Rawvocado, and my favorite dinner dish so far is the lasagna.  The vegan chocolates are very expensive but a super yummy treat.

I am just not a fan of this place.  I've given it three separate chances, with three completely different dinner partners.  Each time was worse than the time before.  The sashimi was rather warm, the rolls lackluster.  The cocktails, while tasty, are very expensive.  And somebody must have hired their cousin as a DJ, because some kid set up speakers and a laptop behind the bar area and proceeded to drive us crazy with his inability to (even try to) beatmatch.  I'm not sure how so many people find this place a winner.  Maybe they've never eaten sushi in a really good establishment.  A bummer, because I love downtown Phoenix and I really want to support the restaurants in this area.  I just can't bring myself to hit this place up again.  :/

Seeking a sour on tap?  Me too!  And Taste of Tops is one of the only places I can find a sour on draft in this IPA-soaked land.  They have 24 rotating taps, always with great variety and top-notch beers -- and they are pretty good about updating their website with what's currently on tap, and chances are if what you want isn't on tap you can probably find it in a cold bottle.  Bartenders are friendly, helpful, and most importantly knowledgeable about beer.  Love this place!

There's nothing better than a tasty cold beer and some good tunes on a warm lazy afternoon, and TMI is an awesome place to kick back and enjoy just that.  The beer selection, albeit somewhat small, is handpicked and lists some of the top beers around AZ.  One of my personal faves is the Imperial Stout - not only does it taste great, but I'm pretty sure its over 8% and definitely packs a punch.    The one-page menu has a tasty selection of appetizers, salads, and sandwiches, as well as some incredible desserts!  One of the first dishes I tried was the green chile mac n cheese, and what a great first impression.  I'm kind of a mac n cheese junkie... TMI's is creamy and yummy and the green-chiles give it just a bit of kick.  I've had several of the other menu items as well.  The artichoke dip is sooooooo good.  Even my housemate, who typically turns his nose at such appetizers, loves this one!  And the chips are from La Tolteca - perfectly crunchy and a little salty.  The salsa is being made in-house now and is so much better than before - great change, guys!  My absolute menu favorite is the recently added CASH MONEY sandwich, which is a house-made cashew butter, cabernet red pepper jelly, and sliced banana sandwich, toasted ever so slightly and served with chips (which are great when stacked on the sandwich, too - love that crunch!).  My second favorite entree is the Coney Dog.  Sorry to all my veggie friends, but this is so good I just can't help it!  This dog is topped with finely chopped red onions and house-made brown-ale-mustard, served on a small baguette.  I haven't had a thing at TMI that isn't delicious yet!  And if you like desserts, you MUST try the chile-chocolate cheesecake.  It might sound a little weird, but believe me, its just the right amount of chile to give an incredible flavor to what is already a delicately delicious cheesecake.  I've also tried a couple of the ice cream flavors and they totally deliver.  I haven't tried the Imperial Stout float, yet, but I'm pretty positive that's going to knock my socks off when I do.  I've always experienced excellent service at TMI.  Matt and Courtney always greet me with smiles, as do the rest of the staff.  One of my pet peeves is a sweaty drink dripping all over the table, so whenever I sit at the tables I ask for a coaster for my beer -- the servers (O'Leary rocks!) are always pleasantly accomodating.  I've never been ill treated or ignored, and not once has my server just disappeared when I'm ready to ask for the check.  As for overall decor, TMI is in a historic house in the Coronado neighborhood and is casual enough for jeans and sneakers, but for those folks who wave the fashionista flag, not to be discouraged -- TMI is swanky enough to support your trendy ass, too!  Inside are two small rooms with what appears to be the original wood floor and a candlelit fireplace.  The furniture (a couple high tops, couple low two-tops, and a long 16-person farmhouse table) are all cozy and comfortable while still giving an upscale impression.  The bar itself appears to be one big solid piece of wood, and its my understanding was custom made by the guy who owns the Royal coffee shop at the Phx Public Market.  But nothing sets a restaurant apart, in my eyes, like an awesome patio.  TMI has a huge patio that wraps around the house, and there are plenty of tables and shade to enjoy Matt's custom playlists (mostly laid-back hip hop). The music isn't so loud as to ever be overbearing, but loud enough that you'll eventually notice your head has been nodding in time to the music as you munch out.  Hands down I absolutely love this place, and its pretty awesome that I can walk the three blocks over to hang out. :)  ---------------------------------------------  I am editing this review to add the following helpful suggestions: - In summer months, a coaster would really keep my table tidy because the cold drinks sweat so much. - Printed menus on nice paper are a great touch, but they should be swapped out with fresh, clean versions when they get smudged with food.

Let me start by saying that I love a bloody mary in the morning!  Not every morning, mind you, but definitely a lazy weekend morning when I'm enjoying some brunch time with my crew.  I like mine with pretty much any tasty veggie tucked in - pickles, olives, celery, whatever...  So imagine how pleased I was when I ordered Culinary Dropout's bacon-infused Bloody Mary -- FREAKIN' YUMMY!  A little spicy, rich, delicious and fragrant... A BLT in a glass with vodka on top -- and a big ol' slice of bacon stickin' out.  But hold on, I got a little anxious -- let me back up for just a minute...  Culinary Dropout is in the location formerly known as Pink Taco.  I never went to Pink Taco because I'm just not going to eat in such a ridiculously trendy Scottsdale hangout, especially one named after a euphemism for female anatomy, so when I found out that trash hole of a restaurant was gone and this new gastropub opened in its place, I was anxious to check it out.  I have no idea what the decor used to look like there, so I can't compare (which I think is less biased anyway), but I really like the giant tin tiles lining the ceiling/walls, the gigantic glass chandeliers, and the comfortable and homey wood furniture.  The place is comfy casual but totally upscale.  When I arrived at the restaurant the hostess greeted me in a friendly manner, immediately disarming me and making me comfortable.  I was at a table of 10 girls, and our server was just awesome - friendly, funny, and helpful with the menu.  As an accompaniment to the earlier mentioned "BLT in a glass" I ordered the shrimp po' boy.  Wow!  Typically po' boys come on toasted baguette like buns that always seem to rip up my mouth.  I usually end up picking the shrimp off with my fork and leaving the brick bread to rot... Not so here!  My shrimp po'boy was on a soft roll, and the shrimp was chopped and mixed with a slightly smokey remoulade, so no shrimps rollin' off my plate! Definitely a big meal, as I couldn't even finish the second half, but my sweet server girl so pleasantly offered to box it up for me so no complaints here!  Not too pricey, as I think for 2 drinks and a sammich it came to about $30 total.  An extra bonus here is the patio, which lines the outside of the restaurant, looking out across Camelback toward Fashion Square mall.  There were both seats and benches (with backs) so the tables looked cozy and pleasant.  And our server said there's live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  May have to hit this place up again in the evening!

The brisket here is fantastic - moist, tender, delicious - and they sell out sometimes so don't delay.  The staff is always friendly and pleasant.  This place is a win!

I'm a regular here and it's entirely because of Alex, the super-friendly bartender.  This guy always has a smile, a quick joke, and ridiculously contagious laughter, not to mention the best service I've ever gotten from a bartender.  He always remembers my drink!  The guy will see me walking across the parking lot and have my beer poured and waiting for me as I walk in the door. He is why I keep coming back.    Although this is a restaurant, primarily the bar is what's up -- a local hangout with a sense of camaraderie unparalleled.  I've never met so many friendly, chatty people at a bar before.  The happy hour specials are score (Kiltlifter and Guiness on tap for $2.50 a pint?!), and if you're looking for some snacks to back that liquor then go for the uber-garlicky fries, the tempura green beans, or the good ol' fashioned pepperoni pizza.  Humble Pie Happy Hour!

I love this place for their many rotating taps, because they almost always have at least one Sour on the menu, and the service is usually very good.  However, their food leaves a little to be desired.

Pizza just doesn't feel like the right word to describe the thin and crispy deliciousity of these flatbreads.  The focus here isn't on some big hunk of bread -- rather, it's on the creative combination and liberal application of their toppings.  The prices are perfect for what we're getting.  And the owners are super cool guys.  My fave so far is the Super Greeky -- a little spicy, a little salty ,and just a tad bit of sweet.  Score!

Every experience here so far has been positive.  Except, maybe, for how easy it is for me to run my bill up sky high on drinks and food over the course of an hour or two -- because I want all the foods and drinks!  This place is comfortable, laid-back, and the bar has TVs on all four sides, so if you're looking for a chill spot to watch the football games, etc...this works (although fills up fast).  And the TATOR TOTS...omg.  Yum!

Daaaayum that is some fantastic fatty brisket!!!  The bark - I want it all!!  So well worth the line and the wait, especially after the tour of the smokers. :)  Love this place and can't wait to go back.

This place is just fantastic.  What a great experience, from start to finish.  Our server Alek was so friendly, helpful, and quite the  snappy dresser.  Our cocktails were top-notch.  The food just killed.  We had the cuban cigars to start (delish!  just barely a hint of carmelized onion) and the mustard based ailoi with pickle bits was a perfect touch.  Our favorite was the chicken piri piri - just a bit of spice, and perfectly flavored.  Cannot wait to return!  Edit - two visits later...STILL love the place.  The sour cherry chicken foccacia - mega noms! The epitaph cocktail, smoky and smooth.  And it turns out that John, the bartender who was at Hula's for about five years, is now working here, wooooo! His signature cocktails are so well made, and his personality and wicked sense of humor are just luxardo cherries on top.  They are gonna get sick of me here... HA!

Great patio, friendly staff, super yummy cauliflower tacos. Everything I've tasted here has been delicious, so there's really nothing on the menu you could go wrong with.  If you're looking for somewhere to work, note that there are very few electrical outlets here so charge up that battery before heading out.
