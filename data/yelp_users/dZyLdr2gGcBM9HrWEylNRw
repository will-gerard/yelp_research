The only place in town that knows how to pour a strong cheap drink. Weekends are always busy and the atmosphere is welcoming. I love this place

We came here after hitting the Monarch Theater right next door. It was 10 bucks per person to get in. For a bar that has a club type of vibe, they actually had a good beer to drink. Odell IPA. I mean, every other dance club type of establishment the have only the normal Bud/Miller/Coors.   I give this place 3 stars because downstairs sucks. The DJ down there sucked really bad, and the smoke machine smelled like crap. Downstairs is a hip hop type of vibe, and upstairs had EDM house music being mixed. As a big time EDM fan, I heard some Wolfgang Gartner, Feed Me, and Porter Robinson. Good stuff. Great music going on upstairs.   Upstairs was awesome, but just way too cramped. Another thing that sucked was that there was a crap ton of dudes dancing up there. They should have taken a queue from the Monarch next door and let ladies in for free.  They ought to have the EDM DJ downstairs, and put the hip hop DJ out of a job, because no one was dancing to his mix. I mean, I tried to give him a chance, but he was playing THE WORST hip hop.Stuff you have never heard that is not dance worthy. I am not expecting the Scottsdale hip hop mash up, but it would hurt to play something someone has actually heard.   Prices were average. 5 bucks for an Odells and 7 bucks for a liquor mixer. I would come back here if they did something better with the downstairs. The bar counters downstairs were really sticky, and there was barely anyone down there. Would it hurt to wipe down your counters more frequently?   I down rated it to 2 stars because of the split atmosphere, and the overwhelming amount of dudes. Otherwise, if it wasn't a sausage fest, I would have given it 3, and if the downstairs wasn't lame, it would get a 4.

Much Like Mateo S. a few comments below, we had a really bad experience. My gf and I have been here in the past, but this time it was bad.  Let me start off by saying, I am not hard to please. I never order special dishes, I never ask for management or a meal comp or ANYTHING of the sort.  The hostess didn't say a word when we walked up. She didn't greet us. She waitied for us to say how many we wanted a table for.  Then she asked if we wanted to sit in the bar while we waited, saying, it would be a 20 minute wait.  This restaurant is not large by any means. One would think that you would know who would be waiting for a table. We each had a drink. They have a decent selection of beer, including one of my favorites, Arrogant Bastard.  The bartender was acting all crazy, slamming the fridge and moving all violently. It seemed that he did not want to be there, but was still polite to the patrons. Basically, I have seen other bartenders that would run circles around him in a place that is twice the size.  After 30 minutes the hostess came into the bar, called my name, did not look up or wait for us to acknowledge her, and then ran out front. Because I had no time to pay the bar tab, I had to chase after her, and by the time I got to the hostess counter, she was already scratching my name off the list. Right before she scratched my name off the pad, she said " Well, scratch that one off the list" in a loud annoyed tone, when I immediately stated that she called me right afterwards.  We were seated with no menus, and our silverware does not come with a knife. Our server was a very nice young man with good manners. He took a long time to come by and check on us periodically. We ordered an appetizer (Satay) and 2 entrees. Sweet and sour Shrimp, and Shrimp and Asparagus. The appetizer took almost 30 minutes to come out. The appetizer is 4 small pieces of chicken with side sauces. It should not take 30 minutes to deliver 4 small pieces of chicken. Right after the appetizer comes out, he mentions there is a problem in the kitchen and our entrees will be out in 10 minutes. He apologizes for the problem and offers us each a drink on the house. We get another beer, and my gf gets a martini. The food comes out 25 minutes after the fact. We ordered extra peanut sauce, but never got it. While eating, our server again apologizes and states we will be comped %20 off of our bill.   My gf doesnt finish her food, and then it gets taken away to get boxed up. The bill comes with %20 off the bill.  Now, we had a restaraunt.com voucher. (much like a Groupon), and you have to spend a certain amount of money in order to claim the voucher.  After the discount for the long wait, we met the criteria for minimum purchse. The bill came back with the %20 discount removed, but only the discount from our voucher added.   So, technically they didn't give us a discount at all. After we signed our bill, we had to flag him down to ask him to bring us our to go food. He totally forgot.   The new owner  came out and apologized to all the big tables. I heard him saying they sold 1500 vouchers in 2 days , and that he is still training his staff to get used to the high volume. He also gave them vouchers for next time.     We were in there for 2 hours. I have never been in an establishment for 2 hours just to eat and GTFO. It gets 2 stars for 3 reasons. The free drinks, the attempt at giving us a discount, and the fact they have one of my fave beers on tap. I have been here in the past with no problems. I would give them ONE more chance.

We arrived an hour after opening on a Saturday. The glass table by the couches was covered in salt and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days.   They have a dart board, which was kinda neat. A food truck was outside when we were there, which is great since this place doesn't have any food other than complimentary popcorn.   Beer wasn't impressive at all. I had a seasonal Cherry Hef, The Amber and the IPA. I and I don't remember the other one I tried. I have had their Milk Stout many times, so I didn't get it here at the brewery.   All of the beers were pretty flat, and not just "poured that way". They need to add a few PSI into their draft system. Otherwise, the flavor wasn't really that great. As you can see by my review, it was so forgettable that I even forgot the 4th beer I had.   Service was slow , and the place wasn't very full. Decor is decent, and the Dog theme is kinda cute.  The waitresses were all wearing these super tight, booty shorts, which I found to be really tacky. I assume this is a choice from management, but it isn't flattering their image. I probably won't ever go back to be honest. Not bad, and worth a stop to see one of the other local Microbreweries, but if you don't live in the area don't make the trip just to check it out.

Bomb Mexican food.  You know it's authentic when your food is all greasy , and slopped together on a plate in a disorderly fashion.  Sub the ham for bacon in the breakfast burrito and add potatoes. You will not be sorry.

I have been here on a few occasions. I had positive feelings in the past, however the most recent experience has left me with a feeling of mistrust and not like a valued customer.  My girlfriend and I both ride, and have purchased front and rear brakes for her bike as well as other various accessories from the shop. After about a year, the rear brake has gotten soft on her bike, and on mine as well. There is still a good amount of pad on them , but are really soft, so I wanted them bled. I do not have the tools to bleed them personally, hence my visit here. I was told they need new pads, and although I JUST put new pads on a few months back (metallic mind you), I was told by the shorter stockier mechanic that, "Some pads wear out in just one run back east." It is CLEAR they are not worn out, but they aren't brand new either.   Now , I am no moron, and I have my own two eyes, but there is a good amount of pad on them. Furthermore, when demonstrating the stiffness in shifting on my front gears, he assertively states in a condescending tone "Don't do that. You will break things."  Now, although he may be correct, there is no reason to talk down to me like that. I have never seen this guy before, and everyone else there has been much friendlier and approachable. Regardless of his intent, the staff should be appealing and charismatic, not stern and short (no pun intended).   I opted out to having work done on my bike, but after the repairs are done on her bike I will be looking for a bike shop, and recommending my friends elsewhere.

I was in a party of 4 to see Tom Segura. For those who don't know, he has gotten very popular over the years, and as such there was a huge turn out. We showed up a little late (5 minutes late), so I understand that part of this is partially our fault, however the venue had definitely oversold the tickets. We were waiting in line for 45 minutes as the staff "Was trying to find a place for us to sit" at the very front of the line to get in. Yes we were late, but we saw people who I heard say "We are on the waiting list" (they didn't have tickets) get in before we did. We asked them to seat us in separate locations in pairs if that would help expedite our seating. SO, they did, but not until 45 minutes after our arrival.   We were seated in the back in a couple of chairs right in a walkway where servers went back and forth. Not at a table or near a table, but IN THE WALKWAY UP AGAINST THE BANNISTER. A server made a comment "This isn't going to work". Which, I completely understand her frustration. Staff should not be putting people there, but they also shouldn't overbook the show. Luckily we didn't get served so we didn't have to fork over the money for a 2 drink minimum (which according to my friends, paid $30 for non alcoholic lemonade).  The seating staff was rude, prices were expensive, and the venue poorly managed. I don't normally go to comedy shows, but if a good comic came to this venue, I would **DEFINITELY NOT ATTEND**. Management needs to not overbook the show to that extent. I understand overbooking is part of a comedy venue, but if you saw how badly they crammed in people over capacity, you would agree.   The only good? They validate your CityScape garage tickets.

I have read the few reviews on this place on yelp and google, and as a major EDM enthusiast, I had to check it out. After hearing this is the spot to be for those who like Electronic music, I was very eager and excited to have a reason to come downtown, and happy to go to this place after our event.   We showed up at 11 pm. This place was damn near empty. It was Friday. I have liked this place on Facebook, and they are always advertising "Fusion Fridays", where there is 1 dollar Bud Lights and 2 for 1 drinks until 11.   We got there right after the specials ended, and the drinks were normal club prices. Ladies got in free, for dudes it was 10 bucks.  They were mixed really weak, and truthfully, I wish they had something better to choose from beer wise.  The sound system was great. I mean, the bass was awesome, but not overpowering. It was on par with the other parts of the audio spectrum. IT WAS REALLY REALLY LOUD. As an "audiophile", I found this to be the only good quality on this particular night. The DJ was local, but there wasn't really anyone dancing. The place was slowly filling up as we left.  Why did we leave? Well, the music was not to my liking. In any club, the DJ plays and caters to the crowd; so the music went from hip hop mixing to regaton. I was there with my girlfriend to dance, but was hoping for the EDM DJ who played earlier in the night. As soon as the regaton started bumping, everyone kept dancing, and of course it kept getting mixed song after song. The crowd was primarily latino at that point, and because of the vibe and the music we decided to go next door to BarSmith (see my review on that place as well).  I will only be back to see a DJ that I like spin. The inside had a warehouse vibe and seemed to be setup more for DJ "shows" rather than a club like environment.

Standard bar fare. Good service, decent tap selection.  They play the UFC fights and it wasn't too crowded.  I will come back

My girlfriend and I live nearby and after giving Lakeside a few tries, we are glad to see a privately owned restaurant with a different concept.   We checked it out initially with a Groupon deal of some kind, but return here regularly. There was one time we had poor service from some waitress, and although I see her there , we were only served by her one time.   Otherwise, service is good, food is good (breakfast and dinner), and they have good beer taps. Although this is more of a restaurant than a bar (doesn't stay open too late), the Happy Hour specials are really really good, and the beer selection is great (Firestone IPA on draft?!! YES PLEASE). Especially since Squid doesn't have good drink specials anymore.   For anyone who has lived in this part of the neighborhood for a while and haven't checked out the Haymaker, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.

The staff is really friendly and the girl working the counter was knowledgeable.  Unfortunately, all but 2 of the beers had really off flavors. I did not taste the brown or the regular hef. As a homebrewer, I have made better beer. I would give them another chance, but if they want to succeed, they are going to need to get rid of those off flavors. Some of them were not drinkable.   I had: Raspberry Wheat Cream Ale Red ale IPA Imperial Red Chipotle IPA
