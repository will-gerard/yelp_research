Been here several times and been disappointed every time with their plant selection. Seems to me the person in charge of the indoor plants isn't doing there job or has too much going on and never has time to water the plants .  Very little variety , poor selection , and what they have is always half dead with no discount available

I didn't have the best experience the first time I went here but I changed my review star after seeing how attentive and awesome customer service the management had, they go above and beyond in trying to make your your experience at pita jungle more that expected.  Yes I will go back ,  we all have bad days, stress, etc...
