Got to agree with others, I am not an IHOP fan.. but this one.. well it takes the pancake!  Had some time to kill before a flight last wed and we went here, daniel iirc was a great waiter, the crapes were tasty and overall just a nice time at an ihop for a change!  Congrats to the management for not being just another chain store that would not have been remembered.  -shawn

Came here for the first time tonight and I am drinking the Golden Gate KoolAid!   The service was top notch, also nice to see a place bring out hot tea right away with out needing to ask for it.   Had the sesame chicken meal with crab puffs, shrimp and the egg roll.  Wow!    Will be back!   Very warm and tasteful place.

I cant believe I am just now writing a review for this wonderful place.   This is the place that started my love for sushi!  While on one hand I should love that.. on the other it bums me I can not have it daily lol.   I found this place while working a few years ago servicing their fire equipment, and afterwards came in and tried it.   The owner is a very very accommodating and polite woman and the sushi has been the best I have enjoyed locally.  Sadako "the owner" has a place that is not only serves great sushi and rolls but does so at a fair price.   The edamame here is just right and place is clean, appealing, good for a quick lunch or a nice candle lit dinner with your significant other. The large fish tank near the back is pretty nice to look at too.  Ill be back soon for sure!   5 stars, support this business for sure. :)

I do not even like coffee!   This family owned place has some charm, appeal.. dare I say it great iced coffee.  I thought the service was good, the server was more than willing to help me along with a couple suggestions and the place was clean.  Ill be back and maybe that fifth star will creep up there .  Kudos to the Jolta Java crew.

I love me some chuys! I am happy to say I live pretty close to this place! I am not sure of other locations but this one is privately owned, the manager and wait staff if friendly. Try the tri tip taco's! I love the happy hour menu and prices. There seems to be many regulars here as I always see familiar faces, they are doing something right.  -shawn

Yup.. still good!   It saddens me not to see this place with more customers. I had a nice time playing pool with my father, enjoying a tasty mug of beer with him and some chicken taco's.  One suggestion for the owners/ management ..   Your large blue sign on the wall needs to be updated, or taken down.. Having nothing on it makes it look like you have gone out of business, more so when the management company for the complex has an "available" sign right out in front of your restaurant as well.  Tell them to move the vulture sign somewhere else!   Ill be back for some tri tips next week!

Seriously?  It's fast food, it's simple food and it's still as inconsistently screwed up as possible every time I've tried this location.   Hard shells were beyond stale, I'm not sure how you even manage this when you guys would be going through so many, leaving them out ?   Ordered chicken... My whole order was chicken..as confirmed on the order screen when I ordered and as it states on my receipt. Did I receive one product with chicken? No.  I don't do fast food often, but I do like to indulge here and there, sadly the taste was so bad I literally can't imagine ever going back, not just this location but any toco bell ever. You killed my taste buds.  Hire managers that actually manage.

Decor aside.. this place is a staple in north mesa. Yes the interior is dated, well so is my grandmothers home but I sure love her dinners as well. :)  The portions are huge! Despite my 160lb walking carcass I eat like a hungry hippo and can hang with the best of them.    Appetite aside I have something to take home each and every time and it makes for a nice snack when reheated.  The service is a little slower, however they are polite and accommodating. By slower I am not implying you are waiting for ever, just that this is no panda express nor would I ever want them to try to emulate such a thing.    It is a place where you can take you time, settle back with some conversation, your laptop or friends and just take your time. The place is large, but that also left me feeling I was not at all rushed or taking a table like other places.  If you are wanting to try this place maybe stop in for lunch, the price and portion cant be beat. I also hope to come down and check out their bar sometime.   Having this place in north mesa is another nice dinner option and they deliver too!

Id safely say this place deserves all five of those pretty starts above.  I live not too far down the road and forget who told me to try this place a couple years ago but I owe them a tasty ruben sandwich!   The place is very quaint and all but hidden unless you were looking for it.   Do not let the outside fool you, your favorite grandma and uncle are inside waiting to make you a tasty treat!   I do not like sour croute, heck I cant even spell it.. tried it on a sandwich here.. yup.. ill be ordering it again! The bread, pickles and the fresh brewed raspberry tea is to die for.  Couple perks I see thus far.. the sweet little old lady and the guy who is warm and welcoming remind me of family. Also being they are on the west side of the street and the building has an overhang in the afternoons you park in their shade. lol well its a bonus to me. The place is clean, people are top notch and the food is something you wont forget.  Price btw is not my main concern when I find a place but its a added value here. The food is under priced if anything, thats ok with me, they just get a more generous tip :)   Try this local deli and the yummy treats they make as well!  -Shawn

Note to self: chicken tacos here are horrible, terrible, deplorable, with out a welcome taste, a full on insult to my palette, flies would turn them down, marooned sailors would rather chew sand than eat these, so bad that a cat falling in the mix would be a welcome addition, so poorly seasoned and dry that I got more moisture and flavor from the cabbage. On the bright side when I throw this up in a bit my dinner from last night will make it taste better going up than it did going down!   If this place has been here for over 18 years it certainly had zero to do with chicken taco sales or the business is actually a front for a money laundering operation for the mob! The owner did look Italian..  My sister and nieces company "niece wisely chose not to eat" did make it slightly bearable though..  Next time I will have the fish tacos so many other people on here review well and hope for the best.   I still can't get over the nasty chicken tacos, the owner needs to try his competitions tacos and refine his, if a stand in baja in the middle of no where can get it right with limited resources he should be able to get it right too.  P.S. the horchada didn't suck.

Fight off the old ladies!  Come in this place and show up early... no no they still will get to your car but if you want some coffee or a chance at a seat you better fend off the other happy customers that found this place way before you!  Customer retention is something any business owner dreams of.. now as I try to sneak in the door I am rushed with loyal customers who are treating the day as if its black friday and this place has door busters !   What the heck?? This place came well recommended by the body shop next to them.. but seriously? A little conversation  with customers later and I learn that they have been in business a really.. really long time and used to be a gas service station. Well.. these customers not only followed them here but have been coming back forever!  I had an alignment done.. really fair price, done on time and overall just walked away towards my car  with a smile about it all. I do most of my own work on my trucks and as such friends are always asking for help because they are afraid of getting ripped off.   Well now I have another great place to send them!  I love the way they treat customers and their cars :)  5 very well deserved stars I was going to say 4.. but I assume the old lady's would track me down to make me change it!

From one car guy to another "maybe you are that other?    The crew here came well recommended.. and I decided to pass that on to a friend of mine in a pinch. She was both uneducated when it comes to cars and needed serious repairs on hers.   Now if you are like her.. or most people you do not like being talked to as if you are a complete fool..  As I walked in well knowing the extent of the repairs needed I was refreshed when I heard their recommendations and the price for her repair.  I would not call Marshall's cheap and why should they try to be?   They offer a professional service, at a fair price and back their work.. that is what a service shop should be all about.   Nothing but happy thoughts from anyone i have sent their way!

Off the chainco's! lol  Today my friends and I pondered what to eat.. a good sandwich was was we decided on but where? Looked right here on yelp and it came up.. most the reviews were good so we went for it. WOW.  I like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak, with peppers and mushroom. I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish.. he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven.  Service was polite, the place was busy but not crowded, it was clean, and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order.  Took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad.  I thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling.   While eating my buddy joked the place was off the chain.. and should rename itself to "off the chainco's" lol  Highly recommended and cant wait to take others here.   -Shawn

Shake what yo momma gave yaaaa!   Come in here late at night and you just might get to give it a whirl! Be it a dj on the turntables or a hula hoop.. not sure where the later one came from but it was entertaining. The pictures on the wall and ceiling along with customer decorated dollar bills can both entertain you while you wait.. or bring out your creative side to leave a memento for the next wonderer.  I wont call this the best sandwich I have ever had.. but over the last 4-5 years I can say its the best one at 2am and stands on its own legs just fine when compared to others! The people who work here are usually pretty friendly, customers as well.   I have seen everything from an over eager party girl recovering on the side walk, people dancing, hula hoops, suns players to under dressed ladies and over hair gelled dupes.   Watch the stumbling 20-40 somethings crawl into cabs, sometime crawl right back out.. hop on a over packed golf cart or attempt to walk down scottsdale road on their 3 inch that was a bad idea heals. Maybe even catch some after club drama and toss in your opinion from the sidelines or ride in on your horse and save a damsel in distress from a life of 1 gallon tubs of hair gel around her home from her new man lol   Order a chicken cutlet hoagie, grab a seat out side and enjoy the people watching...let go your need to save society and just watch the people and laugh for a change while having a nice sandwich on great bread.   Party on Wayne.. Party on Garth!  -shawn

Freestone park weather is almost here!  Pry their cold dead hands off that video game console and get them outside for some fun!  From the train, to the ducks, fishing, the clean picnic area's or the batting cages and carousal there is something to do.  Been here with my family and nieces and just in general while going to gilbert schools, always a nice experience !   The nice weather is almost here!

Red rover red rover send my taste buds over.. to bbq company!  My father and I were in need of lunch and I wanted to try something different.  Asked a friend and he said this place was awesome.. then I realized it was on the same street as the ware house I go to weekly.   So for 5 years I have sadly missed out on this place and settled for soft food or waiting till i made it home to eat.. how sad.   Parking was easy.. walked in, place was clean and pretty busy but it was no issue to get a seat even at 1pm.  I had the Big Butt pulled pork.. wow! Bring the napkins! It was packed full of not just meat.. but also this little secret thing that only some restaurants have discovered called flavor..  say it with me..  Fl--aaaaa-v-ooorrrrrr... emphasis on the R at the end..  The mashed potatoes reminded me of something my grandma would whip up and I ate every last bit of them.  One thing I really liked.. you get your own drink. Now here me out.. I like service and all, but it can be a pain to wait over and over if you are real thirsty. And.. well I was :)    I finished the whole sandwich, and the part of it that did not fit on the bread. I surly would have licked the plate had I been at home, it was that good !  5 stars, Ill be back next week for a meeting too!

This place rocks!   Im pretty well known for destroying things, bummer when its a part that keep the wheels turning while out 4 wheeling in the middle of no mans land. I have used 3 other shops in town over the last 8 years.. happy to say I was turned on to these guys by a local hot rod shop.  now I have solved all my needless driveline issues with other shops!  Quality, customer service, timely service and fair prices are things that have left most business's a long time ago, seems Steve's shop held onto it!   I run their drivelines in my 4x4 truck, rock crawler, blazers and for a corvette project for a friend.. they have got it right, the first time.. each time. Bernie and curly hair steve in the back are great to work with, willing to spend time to see exactly what I need and have become friendly familiar faces!   I recommend and send plenty of folks their way, all have been pleasantly surprised and happy, you will be happy to Im sure.   They can take car of your drivelines, cv shafts, steering gear box's and have have a mechanic as well for any other need or pesky issue your car may toss at you.  Prices in my opinion are fair and service is above par!  Shawn, the fire extinguisher guy

Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach.  Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..  Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.   Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..    Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. "I'm a wishful thinker"  Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by "place was trashed" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said", oh sorry forgot" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.   Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..  Short list  -employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.  But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..  Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.  Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point.   At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish.   He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment.     In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location.   I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.   I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.   -Thanks for reading this little novel.

I have been a fan of Joes BBQ for a long time now.. so when I heard about this place my expectations and excitement was huge!'  Sure enough the drive over from north west mesa was worth it. Everything from the parking on the unique looking pavers from the tall trees said this place was special!  The friendly young lady at the counter tossed out a suggestion for the Buffalo chicken sandwich and I went for it. Now here is the kicker.. I firmly dislike anything that has to do with blue cheese.. So when i received my amazing looking platter and inside the burger there it was I almost took it back.  I tried it anyways rather than order something else or scrape it off.. and WOW. My taste buds loved it! My girlfriend knows I talk a lot.. well I was all but quiet for once as I finished every bite lol   While out side the place has a very warm, back home, family feeling, just a very positive experience! I was told this place was amazing, looks like Ill be saying the same thing to others!  One thing I was hoping for on the wonderful drink station was the red cream soda you have at the BBQ rest.. but the tea was well enough to put away my dismay.  Home run for the joe's crew, this place brings it all together :)

Nice old ladies "if your into that sort of thing "   J/K!   My friends who have lived in mesa for  much longer have been going to Matt's for years. Well bummer when matta's closed and we patiently waited for the new one to open.  Looked at the reviews on here and others complained.. well not this yelper!   We walked in, the building is nice but really has a fresh paint look going on rather than an authentic or rustic look. The mission style is well done but it simply needs the walls a bit more filled up or some paint work to make it look more the part.  The service I thought was prompt, the salsa was fine and when the food came it was nice and hot. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was tasty.   The lady who sat us and the server were very warm and friendly, my friends mentioned they had seen one of them since a child.. either she really likes the place or she is in the family!  4 stars.. with some decor and not a strip mall feel it might get a fifth.   -shawn

I actually love this place and that it is open late but it's always bugged me that they seem to refuse to maintain the building.   For the last few years the men's sink is broke, the wall out front is falling apart, thier stick on tiles are falling off the wall  and missing where you eat by the bar.   Add in that when the power went out the emergency lights had not been maintained or serviced, out of curiosity I've checked for the last two years on the one on the men's room.. It has never worked and I've check it out of boredom when ever I'm here.   Seriously, if you can't maintain this place with the obvious items that are staring you in the face, it makes me ask are you cutting corners elsewhere in places that matter?   It's disappointing at best.   I'll continue being a patron  just hoping the corner cutting doesn't ever result in me getting sick.

Whooo hooo I win again! Actually I lost .. well with  the pac man game they have anyways.. The pizza was full of win!   I was going out for dinner and in these times I really like to support mesa business's and more so if the food rocks.   Nice people, great pizza, they recommended the meat ball.. next time ill try it for sure. The price seemed right on the money for all the toppings and two drinks as well. Left the place with a smile and all three people working telling me thanks and good night. :)   Great asset to down town mesa!  -shawn

They have a bar now!   Just parked to come in for my usual lunch special.. And was a bit confused but happily surprised.   Queens has changed..   1. They have a bar,  a real bar!   2. They moved next door.. Fully renovated and they have a kitchen out back now.. Hello new sit down menu option  3. They have servers now,  sit down,  order and they will bring your check when your done.    Owners have shown a serious commitment to down down and I for one and happy to see it.   With more down town activities,  the Nile and also the art center putting together venues it speeds for great things to come and a nice option for done town.   Thanks!

I would not say I have a huge taste for greek food.  Tried the place while passing by and it sure hit the spot.  Staff, food, wait times and the environment were all to my satisfaction!  I will certainly be coming back soon and testing out my taste buds on something more daring.

Yum yum love me some!    This place has wonderful, I mean wonderful chicken parmesan!  I was worried when the sigh, then the menu changed, worse yet they changed the sauce!  But... we sat down, our fear put aside and ordered out favorite dishes. They tasted better! The chicken parmesan and the sausage rigatoni are amazing as they ever were.   Service has never been a problem and the take out as well is extremely convenient.  Sincerely, a loyal customer, what ever the name is or changes to :)

This place delivers.. ok maybe not literally, but it does bring the goods to the table and my tastebuds!  I have been here about 5-6 times so far with some good friends who showed me the place. The owner and his wife are a class act and have a good thing going here.  Check the place out, shake the owners hand and have the maple hot wings.   Tv and projector is nice and the bar seemed to be filled full of jolly people too, nice place to catch a game.  Wings are only 2.50 a lb on mondays!  Hope others see this and give this place a try.  -shawn    5 stars! P

Wonderful new restaurant in mesa . Baja tacos captures what I have enjoyed for years, a taste of baja!  The shrimp tacos are amazing, the owner is warm and accommodating.  The place is new but her kitchen soul is old and wise when it comes to taste buds.  Thier family are baja natives, they also have been involved in baja racing so bring some stickers or swag you like and put it up on the board !  True Mexican cane sugar coke is here too, this place is authentic baja. Lots of Mexican influence and a walk out of your ordinary.  Try this place out!
