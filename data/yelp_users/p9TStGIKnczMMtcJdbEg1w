LOVE this place! After convincing the husband that he would NOT have to turn in his man card for eating here, he is now a fan as well! We LOVE splitting a breakfast quesadilla on the weekend, we are always shocked at the huge line next door for another restaurant, when there is such great food here.

I think I would like this place drunk. The staff was nice and helpful. The place felt dirty. But the worst part was my husbands sandwich bun was moldy, it was a couple patches, but enough for someone paying attention to see. This happened a couple of months ago. For a place so busy we were shocked that there was time enough for mold to grow on the bread. My friends love this place and I would love to give it another try, but I'm afraid to.

Seriously wasn't all that impressed, wasn't GREAT but wasn't the worst I've had. I don't think I'd return.

Great food, finally good food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. New Mexican food is my fav, I'm a fan for sure! Bummed the times I've came in there wasn't any green sauce for the chips. Very friendly staff.

GUILTY, I am SUPER guilty of writing more booo reviews then YAAAAAAH ones, and I couldn't think of one more deserving...  I could give you the most awesome story about how much I love this place, but chances are your just looking at the stars and skimming, so I'll spare you.  I was so impressed with this place as an urgent care patient, that I decided to make them my go-to family doctor. There are many pluses to having them as my doctor  1. They are super awesome (huge bonus) 2. I always get in same day (beauty of them being an urgent care as well) 3. Prescriptions as I wait (I'm not picking up more virus' by waiting around walgreens) 4. blood-work in-house! (no more waiting at the creepy labs!)  seriously, the above are just bonuses to the level of professionalism and care this place provides. I love that they listen, and that they aren't quick to bust out the pen and pad for a quick fix. I can't recommend this place enough!

This is how it all went down. I thought it would be nice to go out really quick and have a Mommie and Son dinner. Kinda rude staff, whatever I shrug it off and chalk it up to Holiday customer service blues. Then I get to the register, I am carrying my 15 month old, they bring all my food to the register, I get a crappy, half assed "Um, do you need help to your table" "No, I've got it, thanks" THEN I go find a highchair, WOW nasty doesn't begin to describe them, I opt for the somewhat cleaner booster seat. Dust off the crumbs on the only available booth (The junk in-between the cushions, as well as the mystery smears on the wall next to the table should have been a clear sign of RUN) we sit down to eat. I'm finally calming down about the high chair situation, eat my half a sandwich, get half way through my salad, then, wait, did my lettuce just move, (set fork down) WHAT THE HELL!@#!! (see photo) I take my salad plate up to staff and tell them that I'm not upset but that they may need to throw their lettuce out, I get a sight eye roll and a "Why whats wrong with it" Then I said "look at the fork "OH MY GOD!!" she calls what I assume is the manager over, he's sitting at a table in the dining room chatting up some girl, he so professionally replies "WHAT DO YOU WANT" she told him through her teeth that he needed to come over. He saw what was up, then he followed me to the cash register and offered me, get this, a BAG OF CHIPS, I told him "things like this happen, forget it", I gather my things to leave, turn around to see if they are doing anything about the lettuce, didn't seem like it, I did hear one of the staff tell the girl the manager was talking to "Oh, it was only a lettuce bug"  I can understand the bug, things happen, I'm a pretty calm mellow person, but the attitude and the way they treat their customers is really sad.
