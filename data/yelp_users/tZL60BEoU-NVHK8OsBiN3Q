I love this place! I love that it's to-go only (no 3 hour waits, like Pizzaria Bianco), and the mozzarella is mouth watering.  Please try the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. You won't regret it!

Great Pho for super cheap. Quirky little hole-in-the-wall, with the family and kids hanging out.  So cheap, I love it.

If my rating was based on food alone it would have been 5 stars.   The food is excellent! We usually eat at the Glendale/Peoria location and it was our first visit to this Scottsdale location. It was a Saturday night, so it was jam packed and my fiance and I waited about 40 min.  They seated us right next to the kitchen where all the pizza's go out and it was a little nerve racking, wondering if I was gonna get smacked in the head with a pie. Once our server got our order, I didn't see him for the rest of our meal. Two different servers delivered our pie and calzone and another one got us a box and the check. I did look around once, when my fiance's beer was empty and my water was getting low and our server was leaning against a wall chatting with another employee.  I'm chalking up the not-so-great service to it being crazy busy, and we'll definitely go back because of the food, but I doubt at this location.

I absolutley LOVE Chelsea's Kitchen! I can't believe I lived across the street from them for 8 months before eating their delicious-ness!  My fiance's brother and sister-in-law came over to our apartment and we were deciding on a place to eat and drink that wasn't too far so someone could still drive us home (we like to eat, drink and be merry). My future brother-in-law suggested Chelsea's Kitchen since it's literally across the street, obviously within walking distance, that way no one has to drive. So we trekked across the street and into a gorgeous restaurant.  It was a Friday night, but for some reason it wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Our server was a tall, strawberry-blonde type that made the whole experience even better. I think at one point we even invited him to sit and have a drink with us. We started with a pitcher of the white sangria, which is made fresh daily (along with all their food), and soon found ourselves ordering another....and another. It was so refreshing on a hot summers night, we just couldn't resist. I ordered the Short Rib taco platter, which was absolutely to-die-for! The ribs were so tender, and the fresh homemade corn tortillas were perfect! The plate also comes with black beans and rice, guacamole, salsa fresca and sour creme. I couldn't even finish it all. We all ordered something different so that we could all try each others, but I honestly can't remember what my fiance, or my future brother and sister-in-law ordered. That probably has something to do with the large amounts of sangria I was drinking.  Anyway, we went back again just a few weeks ago and had the pleasure of sitting out on their back patio. I definitely suggest waiting for a seat out there. The ambiance they create with the trees and lighting is perfect for a date, or double-date night. We again started with a pitcher of the sangria at the bar while we waited for a table to open on this busier saturday evening. We were seated within the 20 minutes they promised and got the Brussels Sprout Salad to start off our eating pleasures. I'd never really like Brussels Sprouts and was hesitant at first to try it, but when it arrived at the table I was amazed at how green and fresh it looked that I couldn't help myself. That salad has raised the bar on my Brussels sprouts eating for sure!  We LOVE Chelsea's Kitchen and I definitely recommend you eat and drink and be merry here!

I've only been here once so far, but I'm a fan.   Kinda tricky to get to, but once you're there, there's plenty of free parking (which I like).  The bar itself is your typical dive. Nothing too special or bad about it. Friendly staff, and good drinks. A little smelly, but not overwhelmingly so.  What I really liked, was that they were playing Black Sheep on their TV's. Not the Black Sheep with Chris Farley, but the one set in New Zealand where sheep start attacking, killing and turning people into sheep. It's hilarious and bloody. Anyway, it was a funny thing to see after consuming a few drinks.  We were there to see one of my favorite San Diego bands, Writer, as well as a local friend D.S. Yancey. Sound was good, and there was plenty of room for standing and sitting.

The one star is for booze only.   My girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a Friday night before hitting the town for my bachelorette party. We waited at the bar for the rest of our party to arrive, and I was happy with the drink options.  Once our party had all arrived we moved to a table...  Here's where things get lame:  First, one of my good friends asks our server about some wine and he just shrugs and says he doesn't drink wine, but that they have a "wine guy", aka a sommelier which he couldn't pronounce, but that he was at they're other restaurant.... Next, when I order I ask which seafood dish is best and he told me the Happy Family. It's a mix of shrimp, calamari, chicken, and scallops with veggies in a brown sauce, which sounded pretty good to me. Looking back I think he only suggested it because it was one of the more pricier options, at $15.95.  I love veggies and it was mostly snap peas with some broccoli mixed in, so I grab a snap pea and immediately want to spit it out. It tasted like soap :( plus the sauce wasn't brown at all, it was kinda clear. Not much flavor at all, except for the soapy flavor :( I didn't eat much but took the rest home for left overs. Later that night and for the rest of the weekend, I had some weird stomach issues but nothing too serious and chalked it up to the drinking from the same night.  On Monday night, I heated up my left-overs and only took 2 or 3 bites because it tasted so horrible and immediately made my stomach hurt. The next morning I woke up to the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had. I won't give you all the gross details, but I was so sick I couldn't even stand to take a shower.   I read another review just now with someone else getting sick from seafood, so DO NOT order seafood from this place!!

A friend brought me here a few years ago, and they hadn't been open very long. Right off the bat the staff was very friendly, and the entire place was very clean. Ever since then I have been coming to Center Pointe Nails for my gels manicures and pedicures.  They do accept walk-ins but I always make an appointment with my favorite manicurist Hanna.  Her attention to detail is the best I've ever experienced at any nail salon! They are very reasonably priced! $25 for a gel manicure (extra for added design)! I think when I get a pedicure and gel manicure it's $48, which I think is such a great price!   Tip: they only accept cash tips, and $0.90 is added if you used a credit/debit card.
