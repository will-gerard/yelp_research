DISH NETWORK!!!!!  What a freaking racket!!!  I will do everything I can to make sure EVERYONE I know knows how TERRIBLE their customer service is, how unreasonable they are with their service plans, and that my experience with them is nothing short of a NIGHTMARE!

Such a cool vibe and the staff and owners are wonderful!!!  Had already had lunch when we stopped in, so we just had a scone and an iced tea and iced coffee - all were delicious!!  Spent over 2 hours just relaxing and enjoying the spot!  We will definitely be back to try all the wonderful menus items, especially the vegan choices!! So glad to have a place that cares about healthy, clean food and still be hip!  Felt very at home here!  See you soon, Oliver, Gregory and Julie!
