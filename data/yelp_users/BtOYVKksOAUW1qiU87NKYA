Four years ago my future husband and I pulled into a somewhat sketchy-looking parking lot. He wanted to end date with a drink... at the drive-thru liquor store. Really? He assured me that there were exciting things to come, but I was more than a little skeptical.   Walking in, it's pretty much what you would expect in a liquor store- beer, wine, liquor. Don't get me wrong, they have a great selection of hard-to-find brews, but it didn't seem promising for a romantic interlude. He directed me towards the back and down a little staircase. When we reached the bottom, expectations were defied. Who knew that below this random liquor store there was a cute bar and wine cellar?  We've been back many times and really love this place. The beer selection above is excellent and well-priced. The cellar has various wines by the glass and interesting beer on tap. They only have about 6 beers on tap, but you can always choose something from the hundreds in the fridge.

I've been on a super healthy eating kick lately and this place has been a godsend. You can literally fill your entire shopping cart with fresh produce and spend less than $20. Prices vary greatly depending on what they have in stock, but I've seen eggplant selling at 3 for $1, massive blackberry clamshells for $.50, and avocados at 20 for $1.  However, it's not the nicest shopping environment. We affectionately call it "Ghetto Market." It's small and crowded. During winter the snowbirds are out in force. Much of the fruit and veg is close to (or past) its peak. You need to look closely at what you're buying. I've brought home moldy strawberries more than once. And don't even think about trying to find anything organic.  Regardless, the prices are so good it's worth it if you live anywhere near East Mesa.

Flancer's is one of the best places for sandwiches in the valley!  Although everything is always excellent, I have a hard time ordering something other than the prickly pear chicken sandwich. My mouth waters at the thought of its sweet chicken goodness, smothered with a perfect amount of green chile mayonnaise, all on a freshly baked baguette. Delicious!  Other menu items are almost as good. The Chile Birdie Verde and We Must Meat, I Ain't Lion and are also favorites. As far as sides go, definitely get the Jalapeno & Cheddar Mashed Potato Pie. It can be a bit on the spicy side, but it's fantastic.   Flancer's also hosts beer dinners fairly regularly. The chef really takes the menu to a higher level during these evenings. Additionally, on holidays they have pre-prepared meals you can pick up for a special evening. We did this last Valentine's Day and really enjoyed the experience. It was a bit more hands-on than I expected, but everything was amazing!

Maybe I just don't get the concept. In my book improvisational means you make things up as you go. This is not the case at Posh. I'd categorize it as dining Russian Roulette.   Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. I thought the chef would look at my likes and dislikes and specifically cater each course. This was not my experience. Instead, it appeared that there were a certain number of dishes that had been decided on for the night. There was one shrimp dish, one scallop dish, etc. and the chefs picked from these 15 or 20 dishes instead of coming up with anything on the fly.   The food was really hit and miss. The salad was okay, but nothing special. A scallop dish was excellent and the pork cheeks were decent. The goat wasn't particularly good and the shrimp bratwurst was practically inedible. The dessert at the end was the highlight of the evening.   Overall, I expected more. For $75 a plate it just wasn't good enough and there was nothing "improvisational" about the meal.

Unimpressive and overpriced. Tried the lamb ragu and it was one of the blandest dishes I've ever eaten. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the dominant flavor was the noodles! We tried an appetizer that was okay but nothing special (some sort of spicy/sweet shrimp). The best part of the meal was the bread (Breadsmith), however we had to ask for it and it didn't arrive until we were almost done with the meal.  On the plus side, they had a good beer selection featuring some local breweries that you don't see all the time. I do like that they source most of their ingredients locally.

Absolutely amazing! I'm still dreaming about the scallops. The chopped salad was delicious too!

32 Shea is my go-to place for coffee, lunch and happy hour. I work nearby and stop by a few times a week. It's such a cute place. The decor is fabulous and the patio is delightful. Such a great place to hang out with a glass of wine.    The coffee is excellent and I've never had any issues in the drive-thru. I've tried a few of their limited/ seasonal lattes and they've all been great. The lunch menu is excellent- the salads and sandwiches are incredible. Try the tuna and the omg.  I've never had any issues with long wait times. In fact, I'm amazed at how quickly they get food out- the kitchen is miniscule.

I love seeing shows here! Hands down it's the best places to see a band in Phoenix.   What's so great about Crescent? First, they have a lot of fantastic local and national acts that play here. It's big enough for a mid-sized national band, but it still feels intimate. Also, I'm way too old to stand for an entire concert if I don't have to, so I appreciate the bleacher seats in the back. I don't always use them, but it's nice to know I can.  As far as food and drinks go, Crescent is solid. They have a decent craft beer selection and the food is good. The menu is fairly simple, but what they have is tasty. The bartenders and servers have always been quick and attentive.  Also, on Sunday nights they do a decent trivia. It's pretty eclectic, but it's a good time. They give out pretty awesome prizes to the top 6 or so teams including various gift cards, random gift baskets (like a bacon-themed one), concert tickets and various kitchy items. Last time we played we won a lucha libre action figure- score!

Wedding Belles was the best bridal experience I had by far. I didn't have high hopes for finding a dress here, but once I walked in the door I was really impressed. First, everything is under $2000 (I even tried on a gorgeous dress for $350). Second, they have a really great selection. Dresses were modern and there were many different options (much more than you would expect from a small shop). Also, I had really wanted a dress with an illusion neckline. After searching at 6 different stores I had only seen 2 for under $1000. When I walked into Wedding Belles, the first thing I noticed was that they had about 10 moderately priced illusion gowns. This was a great shop and Natalie and Anisa were incredibly helpful. I'm so thrilled to have found my dress here!

Beer for breakfast? Yes please!  I love O.H.S.O. for many reasons- their phenomenal beer selection, the tasty menu, the patio, the free dog biscuits I snag for the pooch- but their beer brunch is the reason I get up most Sunday mornings. For the bargain price of $10, you can enjoy one of several breakfast entrees and an Arizona beer. I'm a huge fan of the green chili pork and the biscuits and beer gravy. They have a great happy hour too with several $3 appetizers and $5 pitchers of Arizona beers.  The only thing I don't love about O.H.S.O. is the parking. It's practically non-existent, but they do have valet.

Piefection is delightful! Not only is the shop incredibly cute, their pies are truly amazing. I've always hated coconut cream pie- usually it's too sickly sweet for me. After a trip to Piefection, I've had to change my mind. Their coconut cream pie was a perfect balance of flavors.

Stopped by for happy hour last week and I was pretty impressed. We tried a few appetizers- chorizo sliders and pasilla chili shrimp. Both were solid choices. I also tried the soup of the day (carrot-ginger with cilantro creme fraiche), I can't even begin to explain how amazing it was. Hope this is offered on a regular basis!  The beer selection was good and included several AZ beers. Happy hour pricing on cocktails was excellent, only $4 or $5 so I definitely sampled a few.  We weren't hungry enough for a full meal, but the entrees sounded delicious. We'll definitely be back!

Republica Emanada is sooooo yummy. The Pernil, the Cubana, the Achiote Potato- they're all delicious. And don't get me started on the Fig Cheese and Caramel. I'm still dreaming about it's gooey deliciousness.  The only thing I've had that I didn't love was the appetizer combo with plantains and yucca fries. It was okay, but not particularly flavorful.   Definitely check this place out, but skip the appetizer and order an extra dessert!

I've been going to Dr. Abbot since I was a kid. He's a great doctor, but he also goes above and beyond for his patients.   Several years ago my mom had some scary eye issue on Christmas Eve. Dr. Abbot opened up just for her. Shortly after college I ended up with a virus that moved into my eye and caused some major complications. I didn't have insurance, but Dr. Abbot treated me for months of follow-up appointments and only charged me for one office visit.   So, even though I've moved at various times and have lived 20+ miles away, I still will always go back to Dr. Abbot!

It's not often that I find a new beer that I truly love. We stopped in for a drink a few weeks ago and I found 3! I can't even remember what they were, but they were fantastic. Apparently they brew new beers all the time. I love that!  We will definitely be back soon.

This is such a fantastic place to take a date! Maybe not a first date, but it would be a great dinner for a 3rd date or beyond. It's dinner and a bit of entertainment!  Here's the low down: Shellfish is ordered by the pound. You pick the flavoring and degree of heat. A while later the food arrives in bags and is unceremoniously dumped onto the table. There are no plates and cutlery isn't generally offered. You'll peel and crack everything yourself. It's a LOT of work, but it's a fun time with a group of friends or a chance to get down and dirty with a date.  We've visited on 4 different occasions, and most of the time they have a lengthy wait for a table. During the hotter months they come by with cold water and slices of watermelon for those standing by. Very considerate!  One last tip...don't forget to bring a breath mint!

Went to Uptown Art with a girlfriend this week and had a blast. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. There were only the two of us, so we basically had a private lesson.  They have tons of paintings to choose from- apparently they have a database of several hundred different pictures.
