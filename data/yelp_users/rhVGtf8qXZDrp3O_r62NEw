Our visit was in a word, sad.  And I REALLY hate having to say that. Me and my S.O. were looking forward to trying this place, with him being from New York we are always on the lookout for a good bagel.   We were seated promptly, so no problems there. The waiter came and offered to bring coffee or water as we were perusing the menu - still good. The problems came when we ordered. I ordered a nova lox sand which and I had the Yelp offer for the mimosa for 1 cent. So I tried to order it and the waiter cut me off and said he'd do that at the  end, not realizing I was trying to order the mimosa and not just trying to cash in on a separate Yelp deal. But. Whatever. S.O. Ordered the morning pile up. We got our food moderately fast and one fill up on our coffee. I still wanted a mimosa and I was going to order a black and white Cookie and a raspberry rugalah. But when our waiter returned he never asked if we wanted anything else-he simply dropped off the bill without saying a word.  He never even asked if the food was good or if we needed a water, nothing. He offered the table next to us to pack up their coffee to go and I would've liked the same but he never asked. I will say that I know the waiter may have been having a rough day, but still. A little common kindness goes a really long way. I was hoping for a great experience and a new breakfast spot, and I ended up with neither.   In summary - Coffee was just ok. Food was ok. (The morning pile up was a mess and tasted bland. My nova lox bagel was actually pretty good) Service was less than I hoped for and I strongly doubt that we will ever return.

I want to preface my review by saying I am probably a dentist's worst nightmare. I'm flinchy and scared. I unabashedly cry and I think everything is going to hurt. I am afraid of doctors in general and denstists are not exempt.  But what does a fraidy cat do when they have excruiating dental pain? Where do we go when we are nervous and scared? Where can we turn if it has been years since we have even been to the dentist and we are embarassed and ashamed of the current state of our teeth?  We can turn to Dr. Core.   He is quite possibly one of the nicest people I have ever met and he is totally easy to trust and talk to about your concerns. I didn't really want to hear about what was going on and he kept the facts quick and easy to understand. He helped matain my focus about the positive side of getting my necessary work done, and he didn't make me feel guilty or nervous. He didn't even judge me for my silly crying which was a comforting bonus.   Everyone at the office is very pleasant and hospitable. After my inital visit I referred a couple of scaredy-cat friends of mine and they can't thank me enough.  I am sure you will thank me too.

Here's the thing.....I am a big fan of excellent customer service and Enterprise has certainly provided me with great service. I was given a rental because my dealership had recalled my car for safety issues. Enterprise issued me a Ford Expedition, which is a very large, but very luxurious SUV. The vehicle was far too large for me, and after a week I was kind of fed up with driving it. I called Enterprise and asked if I would be able to switch vehicles, and they were more than happy to give me a smaller, more fuel efficient car. This was done quickly, with very friendly service. The whole experience was great.

Let me start this by saying that our waitress was really great and tried her best to help us, for her I would give five stars.   Our experience, however, was pretty strange and highly unsatisfactory.   Here's what went down.....so it's New Years Eve and we weren't really planning on going out but we were getting hungry and I thought it would be nice to do something simple and low key. We weren't hungry enough for a full meal so I thought an appetizer and dessert would suffice and I thought e melting pot would be perfect for that. I called at 7 and made a reservation for 9pm. No information was given at the time of any promotions or events for the evening so I thought everything was on track for what I wanted. We got to the restaurant right on time and we seated in less than five minutes. When we  were given the menus we were told that they had a New Years Eve dinner with a set price. I told the waitress we really only wanted the cheese and chocolate fondue. She stated that unfortunately they wouldn't be able to do that and gave a few minutes to look over the menu. When she came back, I asked if the two of us could split one dinner, since we weren't looking to eat a whole entree.  The waitress said she wasn't supposed to that, but she would allow it. She then also mentioned that she had talked to her manager who said that we could do cheese and chocolate at the bar. This sounded perfect and so we grabbed our stuff and followed her back to the bar area. Just as we were sitting down, the manager came up and said they aren't serving only cheese and chocolate this evening. He was so rude about it that we ended up leaving. I was more than willing to pay for one meal and only take the cheese and chocolate, which would mean I was over paying by almost 50%. I was also willing to only choose the cheese and chocolate options listed on the special menu. We were dressed very nicely and had money we would've gladly spent on what we were wanting. Had we been told that it was prix fixe for the evening I wouldn't of made the reservation. But since we were there I thought it would be in a restaurants interest to accommodate a patron who states that they want to buy something. Surely something could've been arranged but we were so rudely handled that I doubt we will return.

There's a soft spot in my heart for the somewhat independent hardware store.   Now, I love the big box stores too, but I love the feeling of the smaller stores. That being said, I really like THIS true value.   They pretty much have everything I need, and everyone there had always treated me with respect. The manager even have me some great advice about painting.   I'll be sure to keep going there and I'm so glad to have them in my neighborhood.

I will start this review by saying that I didn't try the Pho....but I will be back so that I can! M y fiance and I had the spring rolls, and they were delicious and their peanut sauce to dip them in was excellent. For our entrees we each had a noodle bowl, mine had grilled pork and an egg roll and his had chicken, shrimp and an eggroll. All components of the dish were well executed and I thought the prices were fair. I am from an area very known for their vietnamese food, and I have found that it is hard to find what I like here in the Valley....this place really satisfied my craving. Aside from the food the service was great too! We will definitely be back!

Desert Eagle = Desert Disappointment  oooooookkkkkkkkkkk  I am sorry, but I have to weigh in here. This place is a straight up joke. Now, originally I was excited to see a new coffee place go up by my house. When it was first being built it kinda looked like a Dutch Brothers....but imagine my sadness when it was not. In any case, I was still excited because it looked like it was going to be a locally owned place, and even that made me happy because I love me a good coffee shop.   Well today I finally had my chance to give this joint a try. As I drove up, I noticed that no one was waiting - and now I see why. Its a knock off Dutch Bros, and its weak. I get that the DB business model is clearly a successful one, but if you are going to copy someone else the least you can do is come up with something original. I mean....even the menu layout is the same. The prices are the exact same and they offer the exact same types of drinks.  Now, my normal order is a plain americana with cream. I love the one I get at DB, its delicious but nothing special....its just coffee, water and cream, how can you go wrong? OH YEAH! you can go to desert eagle, that would be wrong. It tasted terrible. I mean B A D. I got it and had my S.O. take a sip and he thought it was horrible. "What is that supposed to be?" he asked with a disgusted tone. "An Americano" I said - "that's crap"he replied.  And you know what? He was right. There is a slight chance I will try this again, but no time soon. I am hoping that things are just off because they are so new.   If you are going to suck, just sell out to DB.

Sooooo......against my better thoughts I tried this place again because an out of town friend wanted to try it.   She ordered the White Tail, I ordered nothing.   I took the first sip of her drink, and it just wasn't good at all. We were told the white mocha used in the drink is in a powder form so that it has a bigger boost of flavor. However, there was no flavor to be found.   I drink coffee because it makes me happy, and I love to spend money at local businesses. I inspire my friends to do the same, but this was a total let down.

I am a big fan of yummy, crispy wings and this place definitely satisfies that craving. The restaurant is clean and bright. The staff is friendly and welcoming. They have many flavorful options, and their "scorching" buffalo wings are some of the tastiest HOT wings I've ever had. All in all, I highly recommend this new place.   It's so good I thought "wingstop, who?"
