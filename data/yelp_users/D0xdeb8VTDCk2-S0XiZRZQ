I took my 1 year old (and extremely "happy") shih-tzu daughter to get groomed after a not so good experience at our regular "big box store" groomers... we LOVED the Puff & Fluff experience and we will surely be back!  Plus, I'd rather support local businesses ;-)  My baby looks amazing, she was not stressed when I dropped her off or picked her up, the price was reasonable and the ladies were very friendly.

I am a bride looking for bridesmaid dresses.  Walked in with my Jr. B-maid... we browsed the store for a good 15 minutes... not ONE person acknowledged us or even looked our way.  I guess I didn't 'belong' in this establishment. Very disappointing. My daughter also participates in pageants and we would have patronized frequently... NEVER stepping foot in there again.

My October 2015 wedding was at the Arizona Grand Resort and Spa and boy was it a phenomenal event!  I worked with Tracy and Nikki and I have to say they made me want to quit my job and become a full time event planner!  It was more than a pleasure to work with both of these ladies and although we booked the venue about a year before they were very attentive and were fantastic communicators.  As a bride that planned my own wedding from start to finish, these ladies never made me feel as if I was asking dumb questions or bothering them. They were also organized and detail oriented.  The venue itself, though it's not brand new, is so charming and has great character and several different options for your perfect day.  We opted for an outdoor ceremony (Paseo Gardens) and indoor dinner/ reception (Las Palmas) and both locations were perfect; the grounds were well manicured and the reception location was clean and had so much style and class, our guests loved it all!  The food was beyond amazingly tasty and the cake was gorgeous - just off of a photo that I provided to the pastry chef. Our families enjoyed the resort location and amenities; it was like a destination wedding just a few miles from our home! We are so pleased and wish we could get married every month just to have the perfect day at the perfect location all over again.

My BF decided to surprise me with The Melting Pot experience for our anniversary..I've always wanted to try it and have heard great things from friends.  The Melting Pot definitely did not disappoint! Our fondue aficionado, Kayla, was genuinely nice and made this special night one to remember.  We had the spinach & artichoke cheese to start...Yum!!! Especially on granny smith apples and the pumpernickel bread pieces. The California salad was pretty good, the dressing was REALLY good and the meat and veggie portions in round 3 were perfect. It doesn't LOOK like a lot of food, but trust me when I say your tummy knows the difference! Perfect portions. Last but not least...DESSERT! We had the turtle chocolate...O.M.G. it was heaven on a strawberry, rice krispie treat, pound cake and especially the brownie! The price wasn't too shabby as we did a special for about $40 per person, but heck you're paying for the ambient experience.  Thanks Kayla for making our anniversary one to remember.  We will be back!

The variety of flavors is astounding...how do they come up with this stuff?  I haven't had anything bad and the place is adorable...nice if you want a cool after dinner dessert out on the town.

Based on the Yelp reviews I decided to give Valentina a try for some alterations necessary on my daughter's pageant dress. Wow! Valentina was not only professional and pleasant, she did a phenomenal job shortening the dress, taking it in and creating straps out of the scraps! Seriously I can't even tell where the alterations were done, it looks great!  I highly recommend Valentina's and although it may be a bit pricier than other places (my total was $70), it was well worth the price for an excellent job and friendly service. I will not go anywhere else...and I will definitely recommend her services to everyone that needs work fine on a fine garment.

Went twice in one week the breakfast was SO good!  Through plate sharing I tried the Tryst Omelet (yum), Pancakes (YUM!), Belgian Waffle (YUMMY!), Pecan Crusted French Toast (OMG YUMMY!), Yogurt parfait (meh and overpriced!), and Pecan Smoked Bacon cooked to perfection...not too greasy, too limp or too crispy!  I will definitely return again and again.  The atmosphere is laid back; took the 9-year-old on the 2nd trip and she fit right in- definitely cool for a family outing, a girl's breakfast or perhaps just a mimosa or two.  I'm a major foodie so it's RARE for me to rate 5-stars... please know that 4 stars is excellent in my book (5 is reserved for those extremely rare out-of-the-country tasting authentic- they just flew the food in type foods)  but as for Tryst, I will be back again and again!  Totally worth it and the price is decent!

We've been with Bulwark for 2 months now and just had our 3rd visit.  Not knowing what to expect, now we know that our service is exceptional because John Crawford is our tech.  The last guy didn't do HALF as much to treat our interior and exterior as John... we're thankful he did such a thorough job today and are really hopeful that the scorpions, spiders and other crawlies will stay away from our treated home!  Bulwark has been great, the customer service has been excellent and we look forward to a long relationship!

I had a floral consultation for my October 2015 wedding at Lux about 6 weeks ago.  I spent about 40 minutes with a lady who jotted down a few notes and said she would send me some pricing information and examples of potential arrangements we had discussed. 6 weeks later and I have never heard from them again... I guess they didn't think I was going to spend enough on my small wedding. I even checked junk and spam filters, nothing. Very disappointing when you are planning one of the best days of your life.

If you look up gourmet pizza in the dictionary, Pizzeria Bianco's pizza choices would be staring back at you.  This was some of the tastiest pizza of it's kind that I've had in some time.  As a native of Chicago, I am an open minded pizza lover (I mean I, of course, am a bit biased when it comes to deep dish pizza) but I LOVE pizza and especially love trying different types of toppings, crusts and sausage.  Pizzeria Bianco was all it was cracked up to be (however, I would NOT wait hours to be seated as I've heard is how things go at the downtown location...it's not THAT awesome, lol!)  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is really casual and nice- especially on the patio on a nice 80 degree evening :-)  Will be visiting again and again!

Not only are the Managers and staff some of the friendliest, knowledgeable and amazing people... the food totally rocks! My family and I have had so many entrees side dishes, appetizers, salads, etc from the menu as well as brunch (chicken and waffles, yum!!! stuffed french toast, MORE YUM!!) We have not eaten anything here that we didn't love. Food is always fresh and the flavors are uncanny. We even had our engagement party here back in November and our friends and family loved the atmosphere, the staff and most importantly the food!  Love this place, one of our neighborhood favorites and highly recommended!

I was torn between two and three stars because it was Meh, okay.  I selected GGT to handle my floral arrangements for my wedding in October 2015. I have to say the customer service aspect of working with them was great, they were thorough in reviewing different floral types and discussing my vision for the wedding. For the fact that they were personable and I believe their hearts are in the right place I would give them probably 4 stars.  Unfortunately, the first issue I had though was the incessant lack of communication. I understand that personal situations and business changes occur, however, as a customer those things should not be evident to me.  I had to initiate contact on multiple occasions in the weeks leading up to my wedding to ensure my requests were received and would be honored. I had to ask for updated versions of my contract (which I NEVER received a final one as well as no final bill or receipt that my card was charged and my order was completed.) My wedding bouquet was really nice, perfect size and looked pretty much how I'd expected with the exception that some of the flowers were much darker than my color (which was alright because I'd actually received a call from them letting me know the color was a tad different) BUT many of the flowers in the arrangement already looked to be several days old.  Additionally, the arrangements in my arch had my all time favorite star gazer lilies which looked OLD and some of the petals were compromised- they looked like they had been crushed!! I'm also guessing I didn't have petals on my aisle because it was quite breezy on my wedding day, but they made good use of them in my reception space. I had asked for a different specific corsage, which I did not get, I got three of the same corsage- that was disappointing as well.  Finally, I was utterly disappointed at the size of the centerpieces on my tables, they were much smaller than I expected. I wish I would have asked to see the size of what I was paying for so I could have made a decision to either have more or at least be prepared to dress my table accordingly, but you don't know what you don't know and I guess it's not at the discretion of the seller to visually disclose important information such as sizing to their customer. I am quite disappointed as I was expecting so much more. It seems like you say the word "budget" and you get the least amount possible.

I took my 10-year-old daughter to the Beginning Ballet dance class during the grand opening week and not only did she love the instructor and the class, she pretty much snatched the registration forms from my hands and filled them out herself (she was even awake and practicing what she learned at 7am the next morning!)  The staff is very genuine and friendly and the facility is spacious and well equipped for the dance and fitness classes.  Prices are reasonable for dance/ fitness in the Phoenix area and I hope I can take in a Yoga or Zumba class myself one day soon!  Highly recommended, especially if you or your kids are looking for a great way to get in shape, have fun and deal with a quality establishment.  I'm looking forward to seeing my daughter have fun while learning the basics of ballet (oh and the recital too!)

I called to make an appointment for my Jr. Bridesmaid, two bridesmaids and I to come look for dresses for them - it started with whoever answering the phone sounding like I was an idiot for trying to make an appointment.  We got our schedules together and made our way in on a Sunday early afternoon.  I arrive with my Jr. and one b-maid and my other b-maid is already there browsing.  We are literally browsing around for a good 10 minutes and NO ONE in the store says a word to us.  There is quite a bit of activity going on, I get it, but not even a "hello" when we walked in or "we're busy but we'll get with you as soon as we can." Rude. So finally I get to the counter like "can we get some help?" and the lady says they are short staffed but we could look around and try on whatever we wanted to and hands us a few clips.  To sum it up, we try on dresses, find what we like, actually make an order and come to realize the lady helping us gave me the wrong color swatches for that line so the dress I wanted for my Jr. did not come in that color. They actually tried to get me to change the colors of my wedding! Not. Eventually I very reluctantly decided to get my Jr. a different dress so I can get the color I want, not without being told I would have to pay I'm sure an arm and a leg more to get specific alterations for her... as well as ordering a dress that I KNOW was at least 2 sizes to big for her tiny 00 body. Longer story even shorter, we order the 3 dresses... I get a phone call two days later from the 'owner' who tells me the dresses are discontinued (mind you our credit cards have been charged already) and she rattles off different dresses that she wants me to just take her word for and order over the phone. I asked her to either text or email me the dress numbers so I could look them up and needless to say she never did. Bottom line it took me FOUR run-around phone calls directly to the store and eventually disputing the charge through my credit card company to get my money back. Terrible experience for a bride that is really trying to make the wedding planning fun. I will never do business with Kairas, it was a total disappointment.
