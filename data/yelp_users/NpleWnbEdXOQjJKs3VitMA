They did not do well. They totally screwed my order up and then just seemed indifferent to it.  I should have known better.

While the food is usually very good. This time I went and I am a regular that tips 20%+. My partner and I were completely ignored. We allowed 15 minutes. It will be a long time before I return.

This place is wonderful! So glad to have this place in my neighborhood. While I am not trying to disparage the other reviewers, but....these guys deserve 5 stars.  Why would you give a glowing review of this place and then only give 4 stars?  The ham, cheese and jalape√±o croissant is so tasty.  The donuts are light and fluffy and oh so fresh. They will be my go to place for breakfast on the weekends.
