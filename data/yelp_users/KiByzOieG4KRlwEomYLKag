Me and some friends wanted to get some lunch and decided to head over at this location. This was my first time there. We walked in and nobody greeted us at the entrance and we decided to walk over to one of the open tables. We sat down and waited for about 20 minutes for a server to come by and finally stopped one of the servers. I noticed that there were one bartender and two servers. The server told us that someone will be with us shortly. We were ok with that but it was not busy at all. then after another 15 minutes or so, I decided to walk up to the bartender and asked if we can get some service and at least get us some drinks. Finally, one of the two servers stopped at our table and took our drink and food orders. After she took our orders, we had waited close to 20 minutes and we didn't even get our drinks yet. We were there for almost an hour to get lunch and didn't even get our drinks. I got up and told the bartender that the service is bad and that we are leaving. We got up and walked away. I left this location with a bad experience and hungry.

It was my first time here and they did a great job on my car. I paid half the cost to clean my car here, compared to other car wash places. If you want to save money and go somewhere affordable and still get the same quality service then go to Wash Wizard Auto Spa. I highly recommend this place.

If you want to eat some good breakfast without paying a lot of money, this would be the place. The food is GOOD and for the price, it is well worth it. I just wished I knew about this place a long time ago as I would have saved a lot of money. They have great breakfast specials and the service is GREAT! I would highly recommend this place to everyone especially college students!
