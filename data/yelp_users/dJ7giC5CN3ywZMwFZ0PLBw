I like this store.  The private label brands are great.  Their bakery is second to none.  Everyone is courteous there.  Their prices are a little higher than normal. I don't care because their products are good here and that's value for me.  You have a fan.  Great store.

Tried the New York Combo. It was good pizza. It taste like a NY pizza to me. They open the box for you to look at before you leave. I love the service.

Good food, bad service and please keep your opiinions to yourself!  I visited this bar because I heard about the good atmosphere, food, and the number of TV's for the many sports you can watch.  I favorite thing is that it cooks that good old world Italian food.  I lived in Kansas City where there is a good amount of Italians there and being in Arizona that food seems hard to find.  Santisit's has that good Italian family food packaged in a sports bar and not the traditional Italian family restaurant.  Kudos for that now on to the next.    I visited this place twice over the last week and have received bad service and got insulted on the second visit.  On 07/19 with my fiancee.  We ordered a antipasto salad and a stromboli.  We arrived at 3pm and did not receive our order until 3:45.  I believe the only reason we received that because they over heard the conversation that I was going to leave if the food was not out by 3:45.  I was surprised it took so long to bring the food out and especially a salad.  They could have just brought that out first since that was so simple to make.  We were out on Lake Pleasant that day out in the hot sun for about 4 hours and we grew an appetite.  However, we received the food and it was great.    I visited this place again on 07/23 for happy hour after doing some after hours work and I felt really insulted by the bartender that day and I didn't finish my food that day.  I arrived at there around 5:30pm and order a Michelob Ultra and a stromboli again.  Keep in mind that I am a heavyset guy and my bartender was a skinny 130lbs older lady probably around in her 50's.  She brings my order and looks at the plate and makes a remark saying, "That would last me about 3 days".  I did not understand why she said that but I paid it no mind until I was ready to go.  I only ate half of the plate and when I asked her to package my plate she makes another remark, "I'm suprised you didn't eat the whole thing".  I left the place shocked and insulted.  It took a lot to keep me from cursing this lady out.  I could not believe that she would inpose her opinion on me because I'm heavyset that I just gouge food.  I know that there is a LOT of peope here who gets crazy about this FAT phobia but if it does not affect you, the please don't worry about it.  It's my life and I can do what I want to do.  In addition, you are not a medical professional and you don't know why a person is overweight to begin with.  Even the doctor's themselves do not completely know what causes a person to be overweight becasue if they did 80 percent of adult Americans would not be fat.    This bar really pissed me off and I will not ever go back there again.  On the first time, shame on me but a second time, shame on you.  If the food wasn't good I would probably rate this place a one star.  Please train your staff to pay attention to your customers and be more couretous.  Thanks.

***Customer service is critical to the success for any restaurant***  I come to this restaurant for lunch to order some buffalo wings.  I've only been to this reseaurant once previously and had buffalo wings there and they were pretty good so I thought I would give it another shot.    I am on a low carb diet at the time so I cannot have breaded wings.  When I got my order, I recieved breaded wings.  I told my waitress that I didn't want breaded wings and I had non-breaded wings from here once.  Her reply was "you have to tell me that because all of our wings are breaded here".  Instead of offering to take the wings back and correct the order I had to tell her that.  She just stood there in silence thinking I was going to accept these breaded wings.  When I mentioned about replacing the wings she replied, "its going to take a while".  I wasn't going to say anything but I am spending my money here and I should be treated with respect.    I went to the bar area and asked to speak with the manager on duty. I told him what had happened and he did take action.  The manager said it was not true and it only takes 8 minutes to cook.  When she came back, she seemed pissed and offered me another drink.  Although I didn't want another drink, she snatched up the drink while I was trying to tell her I didn't want another one.  My wings arrived as order and they were good as they were the last time.  Because of the quality of the food and how the manager responded,  I did not give this restaurant a 1 star.     To top it off, before I left she took it upon herself to explain to me what happened.  I have nearly 20 years of customer service.  If you make an error, you don't argue with your customer.  Just apologize for the error and offer to fix it.  It was her fault that she failed to ask how I wanted the wings.  I don't think it was necessary for her to come at my table to continue to go on about it.  If you are going to work in the service industry, you will have to grow a thick skin and not let little things irritate you such as a communication error as this one.

My new spot! $.25 wings on Wednesdays. Huge portions. This is a fun place to go. I love the wheel and the little people there. They got a loyal customer.

Groupon has great deals for this place. The salespeople are annoying sometimes. They always do a good job on my car. I will will continue to visit.

You should try the pepperoni steak.  Its really good.  I think their sandwiches are pricey but they have the best damn phillies period.  Its worth the money.

You must try the honey gold wings!  They are BIG and saucy. You really don't need the dip. You won't stop eating them.

Goddam their burgers are great!  I had the chili cheeseburger. I was a bit skeptic because it was an open face burger but I loved every bit of it.  This place prides on customizing the burger that fits your needs.  I was able to customize my fries as well. Most restaurants put unnecessary salt in their food which I hate.  Their chili on that burger taste just like some home made chili.  The food was not salty and everything was cooked right.  If I wasn't on a diet I would be fat all over again by eating this divine food.  I would recommend Jesus to eat a burger here.  LOL

I had really bad service at this location.  I went back and forth with the waitress about drink specials when they had it posted on their LCD TV's and flyers in their windows.  I sat with a party of 8 and she served everyone at that table food and at least two drinks before she even looked my way.  It took almost 45 minutes for this lady to get me another drink and didn't happen until I went to the manager to complain about her.  To the owner, please hire more outgoing ladies for waitresses because they look attractive does not mean they have the best attitudes.

The food was good. The service was horrible. The waitress was too busy to serve my table. I asked three different waiters for items because she was not coming to my table.   When it was time to pay I showed my Groupon and they would not honor it. They said some of the sushi I had was half price and they would not honor it. In fact I bought $20 worth of sushi that was not half off.   She got the manager and we go through the same argument. In fact it does not even mention it on the Groupon. So he points me to some handwritten signs posted in the restaurant. I felt they were unfair with their Groupon and the service alone should have honored the discount.   I would have given them 1 star but I had to give them credit for the quality of the food.   I'm going to post their Groupon disclosure about their half off sushi. Note. If you serve a special all day it's not happy hour.

This is no longer Francis and Son's car wash. I walked into this place and tried to use my Groupon and the cashier told me it is no longer Francis and Sons anymore. I had to pay full price for my car wash. It would have been helpful for them to post new management signs outside so a customer can know what to expect.

It's SanTans version of Oktoberfest. Sorry not a warehouse full of German beers. I guess why they called it Santan Oktoberfest.  They have great beer it's sad you can't find their beer in every store locally. Overall the festival was great.

Make sure you ask about the coupons before you order. I ordered a footlong specality sandwich and the cashier told me that my coupon was not eligble.  The sandwich artist asked if I wanted some avacado on my sandwich without telling me this would be an extra charge.  Long story short, I ended up paying almost $10 for a footlong sandwich.  I will use the coupon next time but I will never visit this place again.
