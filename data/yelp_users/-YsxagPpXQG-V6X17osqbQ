I was a kid when Gameworks first opened at Arizona Mills and it was a magical place. There were some really great interactive games that blew my mind: A game where you're strapped in a seat and you can rise up to the second story of the building as you try to pop other people's hot air balloons, a motion-detecting combat game, a huge bank of race cars for a racing game.  It's no longer magical. It's best not to know these games used to exist, because Gameworks is now just a large, average arcade with a LOT of broken games.  My companion and I bought Groupons for all-day passes and ultimately it wasn't really worth it. It seemed like up to 1/3 of the games were broken and the most interactive games they had (aside from the shooting/racing games where you hold or get on something) were Rock Band-esque games and DDR. Old news. We played for a couple hours at best and then gave our passes to a parent and his kid. It seemed like they'd enjoy them more than we did.  I'll choose to remember Gameworks for what it was and not what it is.

I was a faithful customer of Del Rey for the year I lived in Tempe and I got all manner of things cleaned there--sweaters, coats, etc.--and everything always came back clean, undamaged, and on time.   For maximum cheapness, sign up for their email list to receive Double Coupon Day passwords (usually around 20% off). They used to do it every Tuesday for this location, but they switched to every two weeks. Plan your dry cleaning schedule accordingly.  I asked them to re-try a stain on a coat once, which they obliged at no extra charge. It came back slightly improved, but the person at the counter told me that they don't use the strongest chemicals because they're a discount cleaner. He recommended a cleaner down the street for more stubborn stains. Luckily, the coat was salvaged in the end. Aside from that, I never brought in anything that was visibly stained, just items that had been worn a handful of times and needed a basic cleaning/refresh.  I wish they'd have some sort of hanger return discount like some places do, but nobody's perfect. For the price and quality of service here, I can't complain.

When you order from a stoner-themed sandwich shop, it's best to prepare for the unexpected every once in a while.   I get takeout here about once a week and call in my order because I have zero patience for waiting. My order is perfect about 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time, there's something missing or something added. Sometimes they have a hard time understanding that when I say I want to add lettuce, tomato, and onion, I do NOT mean I want it "fully loaded" (a menu option that includes lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and house dressing). The guy I talked to on the phone last night also had no idea what I was saying when I said I wanted giardinara on my sandwich. On their menu, it says "Try it with horseradish & giardinara peppers" underneath the sandwich I ordered. He must have been new though, and I'll cut him some slack.  I also hate that my name is in their system as "Jennerfer" (ermahgerd!), which I take to be a result of 1) being stoned, 2) poor spelling skills (come on, Jennifer is a pretty common name, or 3) all of the above.  That said, I keep coming back because they have interesting sandwich toppings and they're pretty delicious overall. I recommend the White Widow and the KGB (with horseradish & giardinara peppers). Always on garlic herb bread.

This place quickly earned a spot in my weekly lunchtime rotation. I've had the meat pizza roll and a slice of the Otto Frankfurter pizza and both were tasty. The quality of the pizza is solid and they've got a nice, crispy crust that's not too thick. They do sell slices of all their pizzas (see uploaded photos for prices) and I appreciate having a nearby pizza joint where I can get a slice and a drink for $5 or less. Thanks, Otto! I'll be back soon.

If you need some time to respond to some email, catch up on the news, or just think things over, this Starbucks is the place for you--you'll be waiting for a long time.  To be fair, the employees here have always been super nice and never mess up my order, but the sheer number of people who flock to such a small store in the morning makes it unbearable. There aren't NEARLY enough people working there to keep up with the orders. I sometimes make the mistake of coming here in the morning thinking that a fun coffee drink would perk up my day. Half the time, I leave pissed off (and empty handed) because the lines at the window and drive-thru are ridiculous. I'm not even that crazy about Starbucks--sometimes I just want a sweet, calorie-laden coffee.  Employees aside, this location is the worst. Don't try to go between 9am-10am on Fridays. Don't try to call in your order because nobody will answer. In fact, just don't go at all.  I know, I know, I should be going to Cartel down the street instead. Maybe one of these days I'll learn my lesson.

This restaurant nearly killed me in the best, most delicious way possible. My companion and I came here for the Arizona Restaurant Week deal and it was NOT a mistake. Everything we ate was solid. We will definitely be back.  Of note: Duck is at its best at Chinese restaurants. Everywhere else I've tried it, it tends to be tough and bland. Not here. District has the best duck I've ever had outside a Chinese restaurant. So flavorful and delicious. The short ribs are also not a disappointment. For dessert, the salted caramel chocolate bar is heaven. So rich. So good. They capped off our evening with lemon-flavored cotton candy, which was a fun treat.  What we ate: -- Appetizer: Duck Quesadilla with pickled Fresno peppers, Crow's Dairy black pepper goat cheese and apple jelly -- Appetizer: Butternut Squash Soup with chipotle and mint crema  -- Nimbus Brown Ale Short Ribs with cheddar jalape√±o grits and locally grown carrots -- Hudson Valley Duck Breast with celery root puree, braised duck leg ragout and mission fig vinaigrette -- Pumpkin Whoopie Pies with bourbon malt shake -- Salted Caramel Chocolate Bar with vanilla chocolate crunch ice cream and burnt marshmallow

A friend brought me here and everything I had was excellent. We ordered the roasted brussels sprouts, roasted corn pizza and a meat/cheese ravioli with some sort of cranberry sauce (it was a special). All were super delicious. I also recommend the peppered pear martini. I'd go back in a heartbeat, I want to try everything else on the menu!  Also, the valet parking is super handy since the parking lot is so small. I'm happy to hand over my keys and let someone else take care of it.

Here's the only thing you need to know: Sweet and Spicy Burger. I was really skeptical when my companion told me about it because 1) ratatouille wouldn't be the first topping I'd put on a burger, and 2) I'm not necessarily a fan of mixing sweet and savory things. I was wrong: It's one of the best, most interesting burgers I've ever had. I got the Peppercorn Burger for myself and it was nicely done and tasty, but I was SO jealous of my companion's Sweet and Spicy Burger after I had a bite. I wanted his instead of mine. The Sweet and Spicy Burger is what I'll be getting next time I visit. And maybe every time.  We also ordered the seasonal coal-roasted vegetables, which happened to be baby bok choy. I've had my share of bok choy (hey, I'm Chinese) and I've never had much more to say about it than "Eh, it's a vegetable," but The Grind prepared it with garlic and sambal or sriracha, and it was DELICIOUS. I wanted to eat an entire plate full of it. The herbed fries rounded out our meal, adding the requisite starch one must have with a burger. Not mind-blowing, but tasty. Nice ambiance for a date night, tasty food offerings, good service. I'll be back.  Of note, the menu on Yelp is not current. It's worth going to The Grind's website for the latest offerings.

If you want a salt fix in liquid form, this is the place for you. I had the Tonkatsu ramen and it was ALARMINGLY salty, to the point where I just gave up halfway through the bowl (and probably should have done so earlier). The noodles and toppings were pretty good but even for a salt lover like me, the broth was much too much. Bad start to my ramen search in Phoenix. Points for a clean, modern atmosphere inside the restaurant, but I won't be back.

Sombrero's is everything I want in my neighborhood Mexican joint: The flavors are bold and spicy, the food is fresh, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly.  The open burrito with barbacoa is my jam. While I like Chipotle as much as the next person and appreciate their ethical/fresh choices, the open burrito from Sombrero's is MEXICAN food. One day I'll try other things (they let you sample the different meats), but my love for the barbacoa open burrito runs deep and it's hard to stray. My companion is a fan of the green chili beef, which is REALLY spicy--too spicy for me, but he's into that sort of thing.  Both of the extra hot salsas at the salsa bar (there's a green and a yellow one) are spicy and flavorful. They're not unbearably spicy, but they'll make you sweat for sure. I thought I only liked tomato-based salsas until I had these. I ignore the others (in part because I always get take-out and the more watery salsas don't travel well).  The horchata really does taste like melted ice cream. Get it.  I've probably been to Sombrero's a couple dozen times but have been too busy stuffing my face with delicious Mexican food to write this review until now. Thanks, Yelp, for helping me find my new favorite neighborhood spot.

Go to Miu's. I fantasize about it. You won't regret it.  Growing up, holidays and birthdays were always celebrated at Chinese restaurants around the Phoenix area -- it was the only food my (Chinese) grandmother would eat. After moving away from Phoenix to a place without good Chinese food, I started craving it again. After reading the review for Miu's in the New Times online, I went to check it out.  This is a place where I want to eat through the entire menu, but I'm having trouble because the dishes I've already gotten are SO GOOD. I'm pretty sure I've never had real kung pao chicken until I had it here. The flavor is so complex and it has a lot of depth to it. We also ordered an eggplant dish recommended by our waitress.   This restaurant hits all the marks: AMAZING food, FAST service (our dishes probably came out in about 5-10 minutes), and very reasonable prices. It's a total win. I visit Phoenix often and Miu's is one of the first things to cross my mind when I do. It's my go-to Chinese spot, hands down.
