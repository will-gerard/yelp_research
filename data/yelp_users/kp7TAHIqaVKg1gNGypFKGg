Lux feels trendier than I'd prefer BUT their Mac-n-Cheese is to die for.  Go get some!  You won't regret it.

I had been a member of OTF PV for just 11 months.  But, I intended to be a life long member.  Why?  Because I loved working out there.  I paid $89.00 a month and every Wed. and Fri at 5:30 I would attend Jesse Ochoa's class.  His class was the best fit for me; it wasn't serious, stuffy or boring.  In fact, it was the opposite.  His class was exciting, electric and entertaining.  He danced, he sang and he instructed his students to ensure we got the best work out we could.  He motivated us.  He inspired us.  And, above all, he was like family to the 5:30 crew two days a week.     Why did I just go two days then?  Well, many times I thought about upgrading my account in order to go at least three days a week but when I looked at the other instructors that were in time slots that worked best for me, I opted to just stay with Jesse.  I've taken Kim's class and she's very, very nice.  I don't have a bad thing to  say about her; she's a great instructor.  I just prefer Jesse because of his upbeat, energentic style - he made an hour seem like 10 minutes!  I've also taken a class with Chris.  He's great to look at (!) but the atmosphere is too boring for me.   And, lastly, I've taken a few classes with Darren.  His condenscending, egotistical attitude is a bit much for me at 5:30 in the morning - or at any time of the day to be honest.   He's insulting, he's rude and not at all inspiring.  Why he's held in such high regard at this location baffles me.  I think someone told me he went to school back in the day with the owners.  Dear Owners:  Wake up.  Darren is an asshole.  Period.   You have staff there that don't even like him but they keep their heads down and tolerate him so they don't find themselves out of a job.  Speaking of being out of a job - let's get back to Jesse and the reason I'm writing this review.  He got fired.  I wrote the owners to express my disappointment in this decision and they wrote back an email saying "please understand we've exhausted all other options...."   I guess I thought OTF was in business for their customers.  Clearly, that's not the case.  To date, I know of at least 4 of us who have quit OTF due to Jesse being let go.  OTF requires a 30 day cancellation notice - but I quit the same day I learned Jesse wouldn't be teaching there any more.   The 30 day notice is their way of getting at least one more month out of people who simply don't want to return, yet they boast that you can still use your sessions for that remaining month.  I told them to charge me and that I'd eat the sessions.  I'm not training there unless Jesse is running the class.  Thankfully he is still employed with Chandler OTF.   To Chandler OTF, you have a true asset on your hands at your studio.  Don't let him go!!!!!

I strum my guitar at Strum University with Nick as my instructor and he's FANTASTIC!  He is truly genuine and simply brilliant with a guitar and he knows how to translate that into instruction for his students.  I highly recommend him!
