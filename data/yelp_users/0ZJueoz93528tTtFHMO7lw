The good news is the restaurant seemed clean, the steak sub was better than expected and the fries, which were requested crispy, were very good.  But the reality is I probably won't be back. It is obvious that they cut a lot of corners and I don't eat out to get lower quality than I could get at home. The fettuccini alfredo with broccoli was well proportioned with pasta (the cheapest part of the dish) but mainly broccoli stems with 2 florets with what tasted like watered down jarred sauce, the mashed potatoes tasted instant, the soup was canned, coffee was never refilled, service was mediocre and atmosphere was lacking.  It's not horrible, but nothing to get excited about and although I usually have a 'give it two tries' policy, I'm pretty sure I'm breaking it this time. Life is too short for mediocre!

We were very excited to go to Elvira's this evening! It was a beautiful 80* and we'd waited  with anticipation as they remodeled. We decided this was the night for our first visit.  We parked in the lovely back parking lot, walked by the beautiful patio and excitedly entered the building. Little did we know, but that's where the fairy tale ends.  We asked the underwhelmed hostess if we could sit outside, 'We aren't seating outside,' she responded. We sucked it up and agreed to sit inside the beautifully remodeled building.   The restaurant was nearly empty yet she tried to seat us at a table right by the hostess stand and kitchen door. We asked for a booth so we were seated at a booth created for no human with the booths so far from the table that we finally decided to pull the table toward one side of the booth and sit as 'same siders.' If their policy is to fill up the worst tables first I highly recommend they change that policy as no guest wants to know they are in a beautifully remodeled restaurant with a fabulous outdoor area and yet are given the choice of 2 places to sit, the bad table or the worse booth.  We ordered 2 waters with lime and 2 draft beers that were listed on their menu under the draft beer heading, even pointing at our selection to be sure. We were brought 2 waters with lemon and 2 bottles of beer. We tried to stay positive with the lemon/lime mix up as the language barrier  could have been the problem. We sent back the bottled beer for a brand she assured us they did have on draft. Lo and behold she came back 10 minutes later to tell us that they do not have draft beer.  After being there for at least 20 minutes it finally occurred to us that that the beautiful evening sitting at the foot of the Superstition Mountains drinking a cold draft beer and eating great mexican food was probably not in our future so we did something we've never done, we politely left.   I am an AJ resident and a foodie and I am determined that AJ CAN HAVE GOOD FOOD EXPERIENCES! Please Elvira's step up your game, we will be glad to give it another chance!

We ventured to Feedbag tonight and were not impressed with the food. The service was very good and portion sizes were nice but the instant macaroni and cheese and instant mashed potatoes left us disappointed.

RWB is NOT just a beer joint, don't let the name fool you. They have great food selections and good service. We have had a couple of uh ohs, so I couldn't give them 5 stars...but we still love it and will go back.   Their special recipes are delicious!

As a proud AJ resident I'm very disappointed that I must do the unthinkable and reduce my previous rating. I've returned two more times to enjoy the soup only to find that it consistently takes and hour to receive a bowl of cold to luke warm soup. The incredibly stale chips don't even begin to fill the void.   Tonight we sat outside, for the second time, at tables which have obviously not made it onto the cleaning list, again. As dusk approached it was clear that they don't have lights nor do they plan to use what appear to be misters. It's apparently just a smoking area for the few existing patrons.   What a missed opportunity to capitalize on a beautiful outdoor area to enjoy Mexican food in the midst of this beautiful desert!   I've called numerous times to ask if they have Happy Hour specials to which they always reply, she hasn't decided yet. We've give up and have agreed not to try again, they clearly have no intention of making things better.

We've given Uncle Bears a few tries because they are pet friendly and have outdoor seating but we won't be back because the food is consistently bad. The pizza is absolutely gross, the tortilla soup is overpriced tasteless broth and the nachos are a huge ripoff.   Don't be fooled by the show of love for pets in their advertising, only once have they even offered to bring her water.   The servers are always pleasant but often completely untrained as they usually have no idea what's on the menu or what the specials are.

We joined recently and like the facility. They pride themselves on their cleanliness and it really is always clean. There are lots of classes, the equipment is in great working order, and I never have to wait for anything even at the busy time of day. One thing to note,  do not accept the 'free training session' unless you want a high pressure sales pitch when it's over.

I had my hair colored and cut today by Charlie and she was fabulous! She understood what I hoped to achieve in long lasting hair style that fit my personality and lifestyle. The salon has a great vibe and loyal clients.

We visited De La Cruz a few weeks ago, almost by accident. I had been passing through Gold Canyon and decided to grab lunch in the area. I noticed De La Cruz hidden at the end of the little strip mall. Being a sucker for a hidden gem or little dive I had to know about De La Cruz so we headed over at dinner time.   Our first impression was that the service was incredible. We were seated outside on a quaint little patio and greeted by our waiter who turned out to be the manager who has worked there for over 10 years. He told us about the great happy hour options and was well versed on the menu and willing to make suggestions without being pushy.   We were anxious to see if the great service and lovely setting would be followed up with delicious food, and it WAS!   Being a latino/american family it was a WIN/WIN/WIN for us and De La Cruz has risen to the place of 'favorite mexican restaurant'!  Please keep it up De La Cruz!! I want to keep this secret to myself so we don't have to wait for a table, but everyone needs to know:)

Hands down best Mexican food I've had in Arizona! (my fianc√© agrees and he's from New Mexico...the closest competition is in New Mexico:)). We've taken many family members of his and mine and no one has been disappointed. The salsa and chips are amazing and the service is always top notch. Go on a Sunday when all the daily specials are available for the 'special' rate. Servings are delicious and huge...we like to order a couple of margaritas and share an entree'.

Silly Mountain is our best kept secret! We love taking a quick morning hike to the top or longer treks around the mountain. The free parking, not too crowded trails and friendly atmosphere make it even better.  The bad news is they are often out of maps, that can be a let down when wanting to try a new route.

We love the garlic romano pizza (especially with the thin crust, ask for it crispy), the gyros and the hummus pita. The appetizer sampler plate was a bust over all and the falafel was hard as a brick. The happy hour chicken wings are delicious!   The service a year or two ago was very good, but our last few visits have left us disappointed, hopefully they get that fixed. We prefer local, non chain restaurants like this and understand they will go through growing pains, but we do not go often because the prices are a bit high.

I have upgraded Los Fave's to 5 stars!   I'm SO GLAD I gave them another try! I now go every Saturday morning for a bean and egg burrito and often during the week for a green chile burrito for dinner. Their red salsa is INCREDIBLE!  Update on the hamburger reference in my earlier review...I'm told they are nasty:(. But I don't care, I don't eat hamburgers anyway! I still want to try to ceviche!

We are full and happy! The service was excellent and the food was fabulous! We shared a delicious half order of homemade biscuits and gravy as an appetizer while we waited for our pumpkin nut oven baked pancake, which the two of us also shared. The pancake was amazing and huge! We were only able to finish 2/3 of it. It was almost a dessert after the savory gravy.

Don't do it!! I should have left when the foul smell hit me before I made it to the door! The staff was not rude and the beer was cold and well priced but the lack of decent food, zero ambiance and stench will keep we from giving it another try.

I've tried their white pizza twice avid both times it was AMAZING! The slice was huge, the crust was thin and crispy, and the cheeses were perfectly melted. The second time I visited Ray's I left my purse behind! When I returned the next day to see if they had found it I was grateful to find that they had put it away safe and sound and tried to contact me. It's a small town pizzeria in a Mesa strip mall!!!   Now, I need to stop leaving my purse in restaurants!!

Apache Junction's hidden treasure!!!  We are new to AJ due to a transfer and decided to ride around to see what's here. After a few weeks we stumbled across Good Apple and we are so happy! We walked the rows of well priced natural/organic foods, supplements, produce and books like kids in a candy shop (organic candy of course!). Then we purchased our banana chips and some delicious frozen yogurt and spent some time as unofficial greeters on the front porch eating our ice cream and welcoming visitors.   We have to get this place on the map!

DELICIOUS! We adore Thai food and try a new Thai restaurant any chance we get. After reading Yelp reviews we decided to try Thai Chili tonight. There was a good sized crowd, but not a wait at 7pm on a Friday, that was a plus. Our waiter, Ray, took great care of us without being over bearing. I got the vegetarian curry and my fiance' ordered the Shrimp Chu Chi, both were fabulous. I ordered mine at a hot level 3 and it was HOT, his was a 4 a FIRE HOT...luckily we like hot foods. But, I beware of the 1 to 10 hot scale, those low numbers are still very hot!   Note that if you order brown rice instead of the white jasmine rice there is an additional $2 charge. They are upfront about the fee, but seriously? $2 for RICE? That didn't dampen my spirits but did make me wonder where else they might try to gouge me, but they didn't.  Entrees are reasonably priced at about $10 to $15 each. We were fortunate to get a Yelp $15 for $10 deal. We also joined their 'club' so the next time we get 20% off.   We will return!

As anyone who follows my Yelps knows, we are new to town and trying to find the 'heart' of AJ. Mickey D's is what small town America is all about!!!   The biscuits and gravy (call them B&G if you want to fit in) are out of this world! Both the biscuits and the gravy are obviously made in house with quality ingredients. Coffee is poured into your cup almost immediately and you get the 'welcome' feeling right away!  The owner spotted that we were newbies and gave us a tour and took our suggestions for menu ideas to heart. They see their customers as real people and are open 365 days a year!   On the down side... I would have given them 5 stars except I did have trouble finding a healthy choice for breakfast and the coffee was a bit weak. I chose the oatmeal, which was average...some steel cut oats, blueberries, granola, yogurt and wheat toast would have been incredible.! But now I know what to expect and will be adding a few more cheat days to my life:)!

We tried Brick's tonight and were very pleased! Erin was fabulous! We sat outside and never felt forgotten. My dozen wings will last me for days...huge portion. I ordered medium and was satisfied, not hot but a little kick. My guy ordered the green chili sliders and tater tots and loved both. I couldn't do the red meat but his tots were awesome! I highly recommend the pumpkin porter!

I don't like giving 5 stars...but I had too! The food, the service and the beer were all incredible!   Alec made sure we made just the right beer and entree selection for each of us and she was dead on. I had the 'veggie' panini. Just so you aren't disappointed, there are no veggies on it...only perfectly ripe heirloom tomatoes, delicious cheeses and olive tempanade (sp), but who cares, I think I want another one tomorrow and maybe the next day! Unbelievable!  My fianc√© got a burger with portabella mushroom and cheese and is sure its the best he's had in a long time if not ever (he's a foodie that's been all over the world!).  We've eaten in many states and quite a few countries and we would put Handlebar Pub and Grill on our short list of favorite eateries.   AJ SHOULD BE VERY PROUD!

This is some of the best food and beer that we've had bar none! (pun intended) And we've eaten/drank all over the world:). To top it off, there is a feeling of hospitality that I can only equate to the days of 'Cheers'. We have even been waited on by the cook who was absolutely delightful! Not that it's a bad place when she's not there...but if you go on a night Alec isn't there, you have to go back again and experience her sweet presence!  I love that this place values good beer and healthy food! Lots of delicious vegetarian options (plus I've been told that the burgers are amazing)! This is always the first place we take out of town guests!  THANK YOU HANDLEBAR FOR MAKING AJ PROUD!!!

As much as I loved Handlebar in the past I'm glad to report that the new owners have kept the same craft beer pub feel but are adding some features longed for by Handlebar lovers...like more predictable hours and even a patio in the future!   I was not happy to hear that Jeff and Alec were selling but my fears were unfounded as they chose the perfect new owners and AJ gets to keep its local treasure!   Love and Godspeed to Jeff and Alec and WELCOME to the new owners!

Thai Foot Massage is the best Thai massage I've ever had...including in resorts and in Europe! And for the price it's absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!   I get the 60 minutes Thai Foot Massage, but they have others that I am going to try. Don't be fooled by the name 'foot massage'...it includes your entire body including scalp as well as stretching. Your clothes stay on the entire time so wear stretchy/comfy clothes or you can change into scrub type clothes they have there. At first you may feel odd about the open room concept but you get over it as soon as it starts.  I gave TFM Gift Certificates as Christmas presents this year and everyone raved that they were the best massages they had ever had.   You must give it a try!

I went to GCC on a fluke but ended up loving it!   The food is home cooked and there are even some vegetarian options! The grilled cheese/mushroom/tomato sandwich is really good, others at the table really enjoyed the roast beef/veggies, the catfish dinner and the cod. All the dishes are ample to huge, the prices are excellent, and the service is great!  I want to try their breakfast and malt shakes soon (but not at the same time:)).

Tonight we decided to drive until we saw an authentic looking Mexican restaurant and give it a try. Our adventurous quest served us well! We shared a Pastor Quesadilla. It was delicious and plenty for the two of us. The service was quick and the place was clean as a pin. I can't wait to go back and try the street tacos.   Note that this is not a mexican restaurant with bowl of chips on the table. I found it refreshing not to be stuffed on chips when the food arrived, but if that is a problem you can probably purchase some chips to eat with the salsa on the salsa bar.

This past summer I took my fianc√© to the Blue Hound for his going away dinner. I made my reservation online and simply noted that he was heading to Afghanistan and asked for a table with a nice view.   We arrived and were taken to a table with a fabulous view! I was thoroughly satisfied, but had no idea what was to come. We ordered the Chef's Geek Out and were absolutely blown away by the service, food and accompanying drinks. Little did we know that at the end of our meal the Chef and staff would bring a card to the table, shake his hand and express their sincere appreciation and ask that we please come back when he returns.   I can't recommend Blue Hound enough and we will gladly return when he gets back!

FANTASTIC! Being burned out on tasteless Chinese food I had no intention of trying this place but I was in a time crunch.   I slowly opened the door, hoping to go unnoticed incase I wanted to gracefully exit. I was immediately impressed with the clean, tasteful decor, not your standard wall of food posters. And the place was nearly full! I decided to stay. You can carry out or eat in, of course I carried out because I was in a rush. So, I placed my order with the courteous man at the register and waited. There was not a lot of room to wait for carry out orders, so I finally parked myself at one if the few open tables.   I ordered House Spicy Chicken and brown rice. I wish there had been some veggies in it but no stars lost, it came exactly as described on the lunch menu, I just assumed it would be a bit lighter with veggies. Next time I will slow down and ask more questions. That being said, although it will not be my go to dish because of lighter taste preferences, it was DELICIOUS and perfectly cooked, including the brown rice. I would definitely recommend it! Even their egg drop soup is flavorful! I don't like egg rolls, so I can't be of any help there!  I'm glad I didn't exit and will definitely go back when I can eat in!

I can't say enough about Pacino's! From the excellent hostess to the way they box your extra food for you away from the table, everything was fabulous!   We were greeted by a fabulous hostess and seated on the patio by Frank, ordering house wine and a delicious cheese and olive board from the Happy Hour menu.   We followed that with salads. My Roasted Beet Salad with Almond Crusted Goat Cheese was ridiculous! My SO who 'doesn't like beets' tried a bite and had to have more. The peppery greens and light and fresh dressing were topped with a little patty of goat cheese that looked lovely but small and inconsequential until I tasted it and realized how unbelievably rich and delicious it was.   He ordered and loved the Kale Caesar Salad with chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the house made Caesar dressing and croutons were amazing. I don't like creamy dressings but this one is so fresh and flavorful that it is used minimally and packs a huge taste. I even loved it!   We initially though about sharing a generously portioned pasta dish but were too full to eat any more and both ended up bringing home salad.  We have a menu full of reasons to go back!

Yelpers were right, Thai Plate is wonderful!   I ordered Pad Thai (level 2 spice) and it was a delicious mix of spice and slightly sweet Thai sauce with a hint of peanut. My fianc√© ordered yellow curry with shrimp and he loved every bite!   Service was excellent, prices and portion sizes were reasonable, and the dish arrived hot and fast!

Excellent food and great service! We love taking our dog and sitting on the patio.  We have never gotten anything we didn't love. The Benedicts are amazing.  There can be a wait, so try to beat the rush or go a bit after the normal breakfast rush if possible.

THE BEST!! We tried High Tide for the first time this week.   The prices were what you would expect for a quality seafood restaurant but well worth the price. Fortunately, their happy hour runs until 6:30 so we arrived in time to enjoy happy hour prices.  The service was excellent! We loved sitting at the bar watching the seafood being steamed and prepped.   I ordered the happy hour crab cake with fried avocado and micro greens as my entree as didn't know how big it would be and was content to order more food it didn't fill me up. I don't have a very large appetite.  The crab cake was DELICIOUS and ample size for me!! The avocado was a bit greasy but I was able to easily remove the fried coating and eat the perfect avocado with the crab cake and micro greens.  My fianc√© ordered salmon salad and said it was perfectly prepared, which is saying a lot as he's very particular about salmon.  We will definitely be back as there are so many other items that we want to try!

We enjoyed our venture to Western BBQ! The food was delicious, service was great and it was clean as a pin! I had the pork BBQ sandwich and my fianc√© had the beef.  Although the quality of the meat and bread were excellent, at nearly $10 for the sandwich alone the price is a bit high for the area and being a small woman it was more of a serving than I wanted. There didn't appear to be a smaller, less expensive option, perhaps they will add a smaller size for their smaller eaters.   I don't know if they offer BBQ by the lb. to go, but it would be great to take to a picnic or serve for dinner if the price was reasonable.  They have a huge space which could accommodate a crowd. The chef told us he has enormous cooking equipment and could prepare large amounts of BBQ wonderfully. He is delightful and clearly a BBQ master, his eyes lit up telling us about his various BBQ equipment and cutting techniques.   If size or price are a concern consider taking someone along and sharing a meal! It's definitely a must try for BBQ lovers!

As luck would have it, I landed at PHX starving, took a wrong turn and ended up at Mission. We weren't sure what it was or where to find the door but ventured on to find treasure in Tempe.   Per our usual, we opted to sit at the bar as we believe that's where to find the heartbeat of an establishment. The setting was authentic Wild West, without being hokey, and the bartender immediately made us feel like regulars.  The menu included creative salads, burgers, and pizza. We ordered a delicious pizza built on a crust from 120 year old sourdough starter and craft beer.   If you are fortunate, as we were, to have the opportunity to sit and chat with Dale at the bar, take it!!!!   We will be back!
