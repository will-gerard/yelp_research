what is it with my luck paying money for services that fail to fix my problem? I went in to Big O Tires after seeing an advertisement on their window for an A/C check. After driving around 2 wks in a hot as hell car I said enough is enough and gave them a call to diagnose the problem. I was told that I was almost a pound low on freon and sent on my way. Yay! Cheapest option, right? Wrong. So very very wrong. Unfortunately I dropped by an hour before closing so I'm guessing I was rushed out while they were closing shop. They either never checked the air coming out of my vents for themselves or they KNEW they were ripping me off $150. As I pulled into my driveway 15 minutes later my car was no cooler at all.  Next day I book it there to see what they could do since I just dropped some cash there. "Come in Saturday and my A/C guy will take a look." Fine.  Come Saturday I'm praying for a leak somewhere. Hey! I paid $15 for flourescent dye! It better prove useful. 30 minutes later and I'm told it is low. "So it leaked since Monday?" I asked. "Monday?" "Yes. I brought it in Monday and paid for an evac and recharge." He had no idea. Smell something fishy yet? So he takes it back again and looks it over finally coming back to say he was wrong about it being low (REEEEEAAALLY FISHY) and it is either one of two parts. I was referred to a shop for them to check as they couldn't do it there but they couldn't refund me for the evac and recharge. However I could have this shop do the repairs and Big O wouldn't charge for the second evac and recharge that would have to be done on my car. First off... nobody would let someone leave their shop after doing work only to have someone else finish the job. WTF.  So here I am now spending a grand for a new A/C today when $29.95 was supposed to diagnose this a week ago.  If you are feeling charitable, at least pick a more honest organization to throw your hard earned money at. Now if you excuse me, I have a district manager to write.

Never again. Never again. Never again.  I will preface this by saying of the four times they have been to our house to do work, they've done a great job of trimming and thinning (the RIGHT trees... more on that later) for a fair price. No complaints there. Crews have typically been fast, efficient and polite. I'd give them 4 stars seperately.   My issue with them and ultimate reason for resorting to writing this review is due to their consistent bad communication and listening skills. I think only half of my calls have ever made it to their office.  1. Half the time when you call during business hours the phone rings and rings eventually switching over to an answering service. It might not even be until the end of your conversation that they identify as such however.   2. We've had calls weeks after service requesting for payment when we've already paid. Harmless error but still makes you question them just a bit.  3. We scheduled a day to have a tree removed only to have them show up unannounced on another day. Luckily I work from home but not knowing a crew of men is going to come to your door when you're sitting around in your pajamas is a bit uncomfortable. Furthermore during this visit I was told that we wouldn't need stump grinding as they could get the stump down fairly low. Yup. It was fairly low and I was pleased. Next week... AGAIN someone shows up unannounced to grind down the stump. It ended up looking great and you would never know a tree was there. Everything was cleaned up afterwards like this tree never existed. Just a whole lot of confusion and miscommunication here. Should have been a red flag but the work was done well so I overlooked it.  4. The last straw though was our most recent problem with miscommunication. We called to have 4 trees trimmed - some Palo Verdes  in our from yard and the large one in our backyard. All total 3 large trees and one smaller sized Palo Verde (it can be trimmed from the ground... just needs proper shaping). We identified the tree in the back to be serviced and were told there was no need for them to come out to give an estimate as they knew the yard and had been out two months previous to remove a tree of the same kind. Not a problem they said! We have that on file they said! Ok. Fantastic. We were happy. Until we came home that day and found our front trees done and the large tree in the back untouched. Instead they trimmed a very small tree in the back that we normally take care of ourselves. Obviously we weren't very excited to see this since this tree is maybe 1/4 the size of the one we needed done which was described in detail and over and over we were told it wasn't a problem. They knew the one.   So we call... were apologized to profusely and they said they would send another crew out the following week to take care of it for free. As we didn't feel this was right, we offer to pay for what the small tree would have cost but no... they wouldn't accept. During the conversation (because our confidence in their listening skills and attention to detail at this point is waning)... the tree in question was described further... the location and THE FACT THAT THERE ARE BRANCHES THAT ARE OVERHANGING THE HOUSE. We figure with this little nugget of information they should be able to tell which tree to trim, thin and shape using that information. Apparently not. They came and went in about 5 minutes never even ringing the doorbell. By the time I realized what was going on and went to find some shoes to go outside they had already left. In the end they trimmed ONLY THE FOUR OR FIVE SMALL LIMBS THAT TOUCHED OUR HOUSE. We are now looking at a tree with one heavy side and it looks like 1/4 of the tree is missing. As I look outside at this tree now I just see a misshapen mess with a few dead limbs exposed. Quite simply... a hot mess.   At this point we call back and lo and behold...again they aren't answering and we get the answering service. A couple hours later (right before they were closing I'm guessing?) we get a call back and I explain the situation. The woman argues that this is all she has written down that we said we wanted done. REALLY? No, we were describing the tree we wanted to be done... not the work we wanted done to it. We called 2 weeks prior requesting this tree be trimmed, thinned, shaped, etc. It still hadn't been done. At this point the woman begins to become argumentative and refuses to send anyone out to actually do the work we had already paid for claiming that they can't afford to send another crew out a third time yet offers a partial refund. How does that make any sense? At this point I wouldn't even know what the refund offer is since no one has returned my call after I had to discuss this with my boyfriend (who paid the bill on this job).  Shame they can't see that sending another crew to fix their multiple screw up is cheaper than losing us as a customer. Oh well. Onto finding another company. Again.

Disregard the canned response to my review. Clearly it is a copy/paste job 8 MONTHS AFTER THE FACT. Unbalancing the tree? Our tree ended up looking like someone cut 1/3 of the tree off VERTICALLY. You really want to start spouting nonsense about an unbalanced tree? In the past 8 months not once has anyone reached out regarding the "offered" refund and there's still absolutely no excuse for a customer being blamed for poor service when you decline twice to send someone out to run over the work wanted. Had that actually happened we never would have had the wrong tree worked on and and the right tree become an eyesore.

I guess coming from the "live music capital of the world" I've seen how a number of clubs and venues work. The Marquee is NOT how one should work.  I just went to my first show there and I can tell you... unless there's something I can't miss I'm not likely to return.  First off... parking? Hello? "We are not allowed to allow people to park in this lot but if you go over to the parking garage ($5) around the corner you can park there..." Uhhhh.... if you can't let people park in that other lot then why is it half filled? Idiots.  Secondly, how hard is it to put up some signs indicating a line for will call and the line for purchasing tickets? When I arrived it was a complete mess with no one (including myself) around me knowing where to go. I got in one line that didn't move, asked staff who didn't know and finally overheard someone say that another line was doing will call. Seriously? Organize, people! It isn't that hard.  Whatever... I have tickets in my hand. Time to go in! Yay! Say what? I have to get patted down? WTF is this? Last time I had to do that was in Boston when I went to see RHPS at the Harvard theater. That's a little different though (not to mention security was actually... GASP ... friendly there). People go in there with all kinda of stuff. But this? I've actually never once had to take my shoes off, get patted down, and be barked at like I was last night.  The sound was meh. I've heard worse in some Boston clubs but I've CERTAINLY heard better.  I can't comment on the bars as I don't usually tend to drink anymore when I go out to shows. Most venues are rips offs when it comes to that and I've come to expect that. Maybe I'm just getting old. Who knows.  It got pretty warm though now and then until they opened some doors on the side about 10-15 minutes before the show ended. My guess is the usual tactic ... drive up drink sales. At least it wasn't so warm as to make me leave (Deep Ellum in Dallas.... I'm thinking of you).   The sloping of the place does allow one to have a better chance of seeing the stage, I will admit. Nice touch. I don't think it causes any more back pain than anywhere else. Standing on a concrete floor for hours hurts in the end no matter where you are. But the space is at least better that a lot of clubs I've seen (Emo's in Austin... I'm thinking of you now).  Sadly the Marquee continues to convince me that the Phoenix area is devoid of decent music support (live or record stores). Ho hum. :(

I find it incredibly hard to believe that this place has such glowing reviews. I'll give them credit... the customer service is awesome and they're super friendly. Unfortunately, after several separate visits with two different cars I can say I'm more than happy to be taking my business elsewhere.  I took my old car in for a new air conditioning compressor and ended up with loud rattling and vibration they "just can't find." It was clearly messed up.   Boyfriend went in with his car numerous times for the axle seal on his car. The first time he brought it in the issue was identified, he was told that the parts would need to be ordered and was sent on his way with the car. One week passed and he hadn't heard from them. It was clear when he finally called that they dropped the ball and never ordered the part as numerous obvious excuses were made. Finally the part comes in and they went to work. After bringing the car home fluid was leaking all over the garage floor. When he brought it back he was told that they didn't have the correct tools and just tried to make do with what they had but would order the correct ones to fix the problem. One year later and the same issue shows up on the other side. He brought in photos of the fluid and area the part was leaking. When shown the photos and after looking at the car they say, "well, it's dry now." Hmmm....

Woot! Love this little place and am super happy to see a non-chain pizza joint nearby. Well, relatively nearby.  I can't speak for the subs and salads yet but the pizza is awesome. If you like a sweet tomato sauce w/ some basil in it to flavor things up... this is your place. Super good flavor. Salami for topping! Yay!   The place is pretty small and every time I've gone there's been a decent amount of people eating. Staff has always been friendly and helpful. The decor is done up with donkeys everywhere and has that unique, independent charm that I miss from my old Austin haunts.  I seriously must try the ice cream place that sits at the side!

Went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it. I think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there.  The service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance?  Next up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal?  I ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. I've had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate?  I guess I just don't understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received. You're better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers.

Seriously? I didn't review this place? Oops!  I've been here twice now and must say there is some good food coming out of their kitchen. The Eggplant Parmesan has some AMAZING sauce with it unlike any I've had before. A lot of red sauces all taste somewhat similar but this is something special.  Both times I've come home with leftovers so portions are on the larger size. Complimentary bread and oil starts your meal off. Service has always been spot on.  My only major gripe about the place is the seating and size of the place. Be warned... this location is SMALL. Both times I went I ended up with ass in my face when someone sat next to me was leaving.

Whoa... strong margaritas. That is my main impression when I left. I can seriously appreciate this after a hard day and having gone to other places which charge the same and feel like I just paid for some watered down margarita mix. These? Tasty... effective. Yessssss....  The atmosphere of this place is pretty cozy with it's dim lighting and large booths. Prices were reasonable and the service was friendly. I ordered the Enchiladas de Chile Relleno and while there wasn't anything about them that stood out, they were delicious all the same.  I absolutely plan on going back and trying more off the menu. An update shall come then.

Oh Red Hot Robot! How shall I count the ways I love thee? It surely is in the dollar signs leaving my wallet. No longer do I resort to my regular two online stores for cutesy and disturbing vinyl goods.  Now, I've not been to some of the real brick and mortar giants in larger cities, but of the cities I have been to, Red Hot Robot has a lot going for it. This is no "art" gallery with a few boxes of Dunnies thrown in a corner on a wall. This is no record store with a case of Qees or some other random toys. This is one (yes, small) store with every inch of space holding books, magazines, plush, blind-boxed items, open blind-box items, customs, etc etc.  There is no better-than-you attitude in this store. Instead you'll find friendly, awesomeness amid a sea of fun. Just make sure you come prepared and TRY not to spend that whole paycheck.  Having ordered from them online before I moved out here recently I can also say their online store is first rate as well.

I'll start off by saying that I've heard in the past they've been hit or miss (possibly more miss than hit). As I am only a recently Arizona resident I cannot validate this. What I will say is that right now they seem to be doing something right judging by the amount of phone calls they take and people picking orders up when I do the same. I've ordered carry out several times and what I've received is something consistent with well-balanced flavors. This is not your sweet sauce style of pizza. In fact, they don't use a lot of sauce at all which may or may not be your kind of thing. The crust is the thin crispy type. I can tell you that one of these little square slices is good the next day.  My only complaint is that as the cheese is not the ooey gooey stringy type so the toppings and cheese do have a tendency to slide off the crust when you bite in. But it doesn't really matter when you've got the flavor to make up for it.  Now if you excuse me... another slice is calling me.

Hurray! Indian food found! Having lived in Boston for a year where you can't help but dine on Indian food frequently I was quite hopeful to fill that void when I moved to Phoenix. Yelp came to the rescue!  I went around noon for the buffet and was immediately greeted with the delicious smells wafting outside the restaurant. Once inside we were quickly shown a table and drink orders taken.   But onward to the food! There were probably 10-12 main items available; I was happy to see about half of which were vegetarian selections (yay for veggie korma!). The food was actually well spiced for being at a buffet. Actually, it was probably the best seasoned Indian I've ever had! I'm not one for spicy as hell food, but come on... how many bland Indian buffets have I had? (don't ask) The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too mushy - and the chicken tikka masala I tried from my partner's plate was quite tender.  The staff was polite and attentive; drinks refilled and used plates taken away promptly. The establishment appeared clean, charming and was quite busy with other diners.  Oh I will be back. Oh yes. Oh yes.

I've come back here time and time again and I gotta say.... REALLY FREAKIN' TASTY. Every visit has offered flavorful dishes that have rotated (Gulab Jamun last time! Yay!). Service is still attentive and super nice. The complimentary Naan is appreciated after getting so used to having to pay extra at other buffets.  Yes, oh, yes.... I am a fan. :)

Sooooo..... I can't believe that it has taken me THIS long to update my review here. So long in fact that I cannot remember the last time I went. All I know is that my second dining experience with roaches was enough to seal the deal - not ever coming back here again. Which is a shame because I've yet to find another buffet that compares in terms of flavor. But if flavor has to come with a roach crawling around the silverware (YES.. the SILVERWARE) or on a wall beside me while employees just watch it... I'd just rather not.  Now granted my last experience was some time ago (some months after the decor was updated and walls went from yellow to blue) but considering the last report of a roach sighting was three months ago, their health inspections I very easily googled all report problems with roaches or roach powder on the premises, and I saw them two separate times?? Not likely changing.   Eat at your own risk.

Woohoo! Lee Lee is something special for a girl who is used to her Asian markets (Super 88 in Boston ... MT Market - the mother of all Asian markets - in Austin among many others across the U.S.).  I adore how well organized this place is. I've been to many where one would expect to find say... Japanese curry in the "curry aisle" and instead it is somewhere else. Lee Lee's breaks it down to absolute simplicity ... ethnicity and ethnicity only. AWESOME. Now I know exactly where to go if I'm looking for some paneer or a bottle of Ribena (DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I LOOKED FOR THIS STUFF IN PHOENIX!?).  I can't speak on behalf of the freshness of the fish as I don't touch the stuff but Lee Lee's is one of the few Asian markets I've been to that isn't permeated with the trademark fishy smell. It's faintly there upon walking in but after a minute I never notice it. The produce? Pretty good looking though. Believe me ... I've seen some questionable stuff in my travels.  The place is always well stocked, clean and has just about anything one would need for regular ethnic meals or adventurous new ideas in the kitchen.  Absolutely delighted to have found this place!

I'm not entirely sure what has happened here. I went looking for some guava paste (which I found with absolutely no problem - thanks Lee Lee aisles!) but... something has changed. Half the registers are missing. The pallets with giant boxes of products in the front corner were gone. Shelves seemed seriously understocked. I'm not sure if they're just cutting back or something is wrong but the feeling it gave was rather depressing.

YUM. Note that. Capital Y-U-M. I've had this place written down on a note for ages after searching for a decent Thai place nearby ages ago. I FINALLY got around to going last week and I cannot WAIT to go back.  Service was AMAZING and incredibly friendly. It was one of those experiences where you felt very welcome and completely at ease. The food was flavorful, hot and wonderfully perfect in terms of spice. I ordered the Masuman Curry w/ tofu (a staple of mine) and my boyfriend ordered the Green Curry w/ tofu. Both were terrific, good portions (enough for a full lunch the next day) and came with an abundance of rice. Maybe I've just become so used to rice costing extra and coming in a tiny little bowl, but this was a welcome change. Again... more for leftovers!  Seriously... this place has won a place in my heart and I can't wait to go back and try more off the menu.

Pens pens and more pens!  I came here looking for some ink for a fountain pen I recently purchased online. WOW. I wasn't expecting the incredible selection they had nor the friendly help I received. Donald S says it best... they have everything. Definitely going back!

I came here looking for a Chinese buffet that was decent. I left feeling pretty underwhelmed. If you like seafood then this is definitely your joint. Sadly, I won't touch the stuff so the food options were pretty limited for me. Minus big points. The food wasn't stellar but it was better than some places I've been to where it feels like things have been sitting out all day. Service wasn't rude but definitely not outgoing in any way. Can't say I'd ever have a reason so come back. Disappointing... :(

Wowsers! Thank you, Yelp, for a good find!  I just purchased a new car down the street and was heading there to drop off the title on my old car. Not having done grocery shopping for the week I knew grabbing something on the way home would be in order. So I pull up my Yelp app, plug in the zip code and look at some reviews. Wraps, rice bowls and salads? Sounds healthy... I could go for that! So I perused the menu online, decided on something to pick up for myself and my boyfriend and set out after finishing at the dealer.  Immediately I was struck by how QUAINT the outside looked. It reminded me of something I would see in Austin (where I moved from a couple years back). Inside the decor is white, minimal, clean and charming. And WHOA! Cider and wine in the cooler? Yesssss.... I definitely felt at home here. I made my order to go, made some small talk with one of the employees and sat for maybe 5 minutes tops for my food and headed home.  The veggie rice bowl was SO GOOD. I wasn't sure what to expect but there's a whole lot of flavor going on in there, a perfect amount of spice, and NO skimping on the veggies. The portion was just right. I felt full but not agonizingly so.  My only complaint was that the side order of pasta salad was really small. As in the "why bother?" sort of way. I'm willing to look over that though as my boyfriend said it was tasty.  If I'm ever in that neighborhood again I wouldn't hesitate to go back again for SURE. A happy discovery!

Driving by to get groceries the other day I spied the words - "frozen yogurt" and "self serve". In my hood! Hells yes! So tonight I visited after having seen the "now open" banner thrown up.  Decor is sparce with some bright, vibrant orange walls and a few tables inside and a couple just outside. Two young girls stood behind the toppings counter who barely looked old enough to be working a register while an older woman (owner? mother?) stood aside watching over. I don't know why but this just left me feeling a little uncomfortable.  As for the yogurt, there are 8 dispensers on the wall. Flavors were pretty standard - plain tart, yellow cake batter, vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, etc. It would have been nice to see more tart flavors than just plain. Tonight, however, I opted for the pumpkin pie (yesssss) swirled with chocolate. Hm. BIG mistake. I don't know what chocolate mix they are using but it claims to have fat-burning properties. Maybe so, but it tastes like frozen Carnation Instant Breakfast or Ensure. It was chalky, nasty and overpowered everything. Not a drop of pumpkin flavor was to be had. Talk about heartbreaking. This girl loves her pumpkin, you see.   Now I will give them this... they just opened up and as such I will update this once they get things going a bit more. Opening just didn't wow me. I've had better elsewhere and will likely continue going to that elsewhere.

After some time driving by this joint and giggling because you can only see "BURGER" in huge letters from their sign... WE DID IT. And there's no going back.   Everything about this place is what you know about burgers but flipped upside down. Pickles? No... thin cucumber slices. Onions? No... PICKLED onions. The combinations that these guys come up with is spectacular - ummm... maple bacon pecan milkshake anyone? YES. Hit that. Hit it hard. You won't regret it.  French toast fries, lucky charm milkshakes, sweet potato tater tots, brûlée burger (burnt sugar on a brioche bun, you guys!)... this place is far from ordinary and a creative adventure for your taste buds to go on.  Each week they offer up a new burger and shake that are not on the regular menu and every time they have been incredible.  Our bills have been a little on the pricey side but what you're paying for is something special indeed.

I started out at another salon two years ago when I moved here on a whim thanks to Yelp. They subscribed to my policy of using non-sulfate and organic products. Sadly, the previous stylist (though good) consistently gave me "mom hair". I'm not a mom. I will never be a mom. i didn't WANT mom hair. In came Khristine and all was changed.  I'm THRILLED that she has her own digs now. Khristine is a real gem in terms of hair. I can go to her and she knows JUST what to do with my hair. She's adorable, a joy to be around, super friendly and funny to boot. She's the first stylist who I've gone to and left saying "OMG I LOVE MY HAIR." She still uses organic products and is also amazing with color. I just wish I could afford it more! Soon though! :D  I gladly drive almost an hour to see her. Hell, I even got my boyfriend going to her. Which probably says a lot. :)

I wish I knew where these other reviewers were eating because I cannot believe that we are at the same place. The service was super friendly and outgoing but the food? Mediocre at BEST. Under seasoned chicken. Rice wasn't horrible but was a bit on the blander side compared to other places. Gyro meat seemed like it may have been frozen. Over salted fries. Learned my lesson. Never go to a place and order a Gyro where you can't see the meat before being shaved off.

STAY AWAY!! We ordered a 2 piece sectional 3 wks ago & were given a delivery date of 5/3. The purchase process was attentive but AT NO POINT WERE WE TOLD THAT OUR DELIVERY MIGHT BE INCOMPLETE. This was our second purchase through them as we're refurnishing our whole house but I can guarantee this is our last. When we received the notification that delivery was coming on 5/3 I thought "AWESOME! Two decent experiences!" So we paid a ridiculous amount to have our old, ripped up sectional picked up and hauled away by a junk company since Salvation Army wouldn't even take it. Delivery day comes... I go online to check where we are in line and watch the progress to our house. The truck finally comes and we explain where we want the rug and sectional we purchased. "We don't have a sectional." I'M SORRY, WHAT??? So we call the customer care line and get "transferred" to the escalation line which equates to hearing a message about hearing back from someone within 1 business day BUT AT NO TIME ARE YOU EVEN ABLE TO LEAVE A MESSAGE OR PHONE NUMBER. No one can provide a reason why the two pieces THAT AREN'T EVEN A SPECIAL ORDER (one sectional piece and an ottoman that is part of the standard floor model you can get delivered same day) are not available but the one piece that IS a special order is done. This fabric was checked and rechecked at the time of purchase and supposed to be in stock as it is the default fabric the sectional comes in.  We now have no seating & no estimate on when our couch will be delivered. I feel like we're now out $2700 and nothing to show for it.
