Great food for a great price! Super big portions. I finally found a great Chinese delivery place.

One star because the food was good...once we actually got it. I understand being busy on a Sunday morning, but we waited almost an hour for our food. This probably wouldn't have seemed as bad had anyone actually come to check on us, apologize for the wait, ask if we needed a refill, ANYTHING. We didn't get check on once, and we were about to cancel our order and walk out right when our food showed up. About five minutes after that, another table stood up and left making sure the staff knew they would never be coming back. I'm definitely with them, NEVER coming back. Once we were finishing up, they were taking our plates as quickly as possible, and once we said we would take the check they finally had time to bring THAT to us quickly. Definitely made us feel rushed out the door. The worst service I have ever experienced, I regret that we even had to pay for our meal.

They installed a tankless water heater, installed a water softener, pressure assist pump install, installed garbage disposal in bar sink, installed bar sink and fixtures, run drain lines for sink and ice maker for bar install.  All of the work was done quickly and exactly how I wanted it.  This is why I have used Tinker Plumbing over and over
