The food was mediocre and the flys where omnipresent. I doubt I'll ever return. Still love Joe's BBQ but not at all impressed with this venture

I really enjoy their wings and the take out process has been smooth and painless! The dine in atmosphere is on par with other similar restaurants.   Overall I've yet to have a poor experience and the food is above par!
