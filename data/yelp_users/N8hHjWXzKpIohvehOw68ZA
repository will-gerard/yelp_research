Went in tonight to eat dinner at the bar. I had a couple of beers - the beer selection is limited, but respectable. Great considering it's a wine bar! Service was just okay. The bartender was helpful enough, but I had to sort of flag him down when I needed something - he never really checked in with me. Not a dea-lbreaker, but nothing outstanding.   I ordered the bruchetta (one each of the apple and brie, prosciutto and fig, burrata and bacon, and warm artichoke). The bruschetta was incredible. I'd go back just to eat it all again. Maybe tomorrow.  Parking was open and available when I got there, but it looked like it was exclusively valet starting at about 5pm.

Kind of unimpressed with the beer. I did the flight of 8 beers, which is a great price at $9. But I didn't get great service since I wasn't going to base my tip on the bra size of the bartenders. The men around me got plenty of attention but I was left to flag one of the girls down to get my tab. Ick.

I ate at the Greene House on a Tuesday night around 7pm. It wasn't busy at all which was nice, actually. Since I was traveling for work, I was dining alone.  My server (I think her name was Maryann) was excellent. Personable and attentive, she helped me choose a cocktail. I ended up with the Smashed Irishman which was whiskey, lemon juice, mint, honey and a Guinness reduction. It was delicious!  Since it was just me, I chose the Smoked Salmon Bruscetta with a side of mac n' cheese (because I can't help myself). The salmon bruscetta had this amazing horseradish sauce on it and was light and fresh but really satisfying. The mac n' cheese tasted like nothing more than penne with velveeta. Not impressed with that.  Overall, SUPER pleased with the whole experience. Have been thinking about that bruscetta ever since...

Typical (which is still good!) as far as inventory but the staff is always so delightful. It's a pleasure to shop there!

Went there after a not-so-good experience at a local tap room and it was great. I had a great burger (Classic with jalapenos) and a Jamey and Ginger. Service (hostess and server) and food were both fantastic.

Positively the snobbiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Get over yourselves and crack a smile, for goodness sake!
