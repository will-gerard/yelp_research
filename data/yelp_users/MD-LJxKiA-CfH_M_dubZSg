This is the best nail salon I have found in Gilbert so far and believe me- I've visited pretty much all of them in the last year since I moved here.  Every other place I went, I came home pissy because the mani or pedi was not what I had hoped for.  I am so pleased with the gel manicures here- they do an excellent job.  Also a nice, long foot massage with pedis.  Also very clean.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because some of the staff seems grumpy like they don't want to be there...not all just some.  Kelly is great.

I came here for the first time today. Previously, I have gone to Warner Vista Animal Hospital, but had such a poor experience last time that I will never go back.  While I did not get good news for my sick kitty today, I felt like the staff acted very caring towards her. We were ushered immediately into a room and were seen very quickly by the tech, then vet, Dr. Longoni. I felt like all of the testing, results, and treatment options were well explained to me and I was asked if I understood after everything. I appreciated the time spent in treating myself and my cat with kindness.

I wanted to like this place as it was reccommended to me by a friend, but after giving it two shots, I probably will not be returning.  No complaints about service and it is a cute restaurant, but the food quality is poor.  Pollo rico is dry, chips are just meh, salsa is bland and it seems that everything is covered in so much cheese that you can't taste the food underneath.  With the amount of Mexican restaurants available in the area, do yourself a favor and skip this one.

Overall I just wasn't super impressed with this place.  I heard good things about it, so I decided to brave the very long wait...which is always present and eat breakfast here.  The food was decent, don't get me wrong, but there was nothing that truly stood out to me and it's quite crowded.   Sorry, but I would rather go to the Gilbert House down the street any day.

They also accept credit cards too... Not just cash, just went there and used credit card. Got the dreamsicle with cream and the hubby got pi√±a colada with cream- delicious with perfectly smooth texture!

Love this place.  It's usually pretty quiet, which I appreciate.  They do a great job and give you a shoulder massage while your nails are drying.

I have to say that this is my favorite chinese restaurant and probably a very underappreciated one.  This place is definitely a bit of a hole in the wall- outdated on the inside, not so great decor.  The staff, however is very friendly and I have always enjoyed everything I order here.  The restaurant is quiet and relaxing and they have some fun drinks to order from the bar.  I especially appreciate the Scorpian Bowl for Two...which comes out flaming.  The prices are good too and they deliver.

I really wanted to like this place because a. I love Italian food, b. A few people told me I needed to go here, and c. It has a cozy decor, quiet and romantic feel.  Pros- the service is good, my water was never empty, and plates were cleared quickly.  Cons- the food.  Bread was completely average- nothing special.  My house salad although flavorful was completely drowned in dressing. And onto my meal- spinach ravioli. I think the ravioli would have been great, but I could not taste it due to the obscene amount of garlic cream sauce it was drowned in. After that amount of garlic, I will never have to worry about vampires or my husband ever kissing me again. I have been here one time before and had a pasta dish with pancetta, peas and cream sauce. The sauce was so rich that it made me feel sick and lacked any real flavor.

Love Four Peaks.  Always packed with people- so make sure to go in expecting that and some difficulty parking.  Fun place to go with a group of friends.  Love the Hopknot- nice strong beer.  The food is always great too.  Nice place for day drinking on the patio!

Looove this place... I swear I could eat this food every night.  I live right nearby and it's so nice to have a walk up window for take-out and the food comes out very fast.  I usually order a meat plate with 2 sides- Brisket or pulled pork, mac and cheese and apple sauce.  I have tried other items and have never been disappointed.  Favorite BBQ place for take out.  Not too big on dining in since you walk up to order your food.

Favorite Greek restaurant in the area. Wait staff could use a bit of improvement on refilling drinks- it seems they get pretty overwhelmed when busy. I will bypass that though since I really love the food. Their falafel is the best- especially served on a pita. Gyros and Chicken Shawarma are super tasty.  They have a reasonably priced buffet if you would like to sample a bit of everything.  I usually order take-out and the orders are quick.

Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and have to say this was my most favorite dining experience.   Food was excellent.  We did a 5 course meal and were pleasantly surprised by all of the little food items they brought in between the courses.  Each course was unique and fun.  Great service as well.  Totally worth the drive to Cave Creek!

Favorite breakfast spot in Gilbert!  Nestled in a cute old home in Gilbert- feels very cozy and a nice option to eat on their patio too.  The apple pancakes are seriously to die for and reason enough to come here.  The wait is not usually too bad for a smaller place on the weekend.

My favorite place to study in college.  Great patio and yummy coffee! quick service with quirky staff. Just wish they would serve more food items, as there are only desserts to choose from.

Taro Slush with Boba = Soooo Good!  I admit, this is the only thing I ever order because it is just so freakin tasty.  They have a ton of other stuff to choose from on their menu too!  Service is very quick!

Love the outdoor seating at picnic tables, which is perfect during our cooler months.  Have only eaten breakfast here, but it's always been great.  Only downfall is long line to order and have to pick up your food...personally I like to be served, but that is just the style of this place.

I have to say that what makes this place memorable to me is the owner Tony... he is a crack up whether intentionally or not and very friendly.  The pizzas are huge and quite good.

The pancakes are fantastic- from the regular old plain pancakes to the deliciously sinful House Special oven baked pancakes.  My husband and I love coming here on the weekends. It's slightly out of street view and doesn't get some of the excessive volume of people that other places have on weekends- places that aren't nearly as good. Unique artwork on the walls, comfy/casual atmosphere, good service.

Went with my husband and another couple to a beer and donut pairing event here and had a truly enjoyable experience.  I mean how many places do donut and beer pairings?!  It was quite yummy.  They often have live music which is another bonus- but it's not so loud you can't enjoy conversation with the person next to you.  I don't really understand the negative reviews regarding this place.

I am a die hard Rigatony's fan.  I come here for my birthday each year and usually my brother does for his as well.  We were sad when the location on Brown road closed, but have to say that this location is actually much better.  Good to make a reservation so that you don't have to wait.  Love the Chicken Picatta, Veal Canneloni, Sangria, Bread Pudding and most of all the antipasto salad which is the best!!  I've always had great service too!

This is my husband's favorite restaurant.  Everything is good, but what I truly appreciated was a homemade cheese dessert yumm.  Family owned restaurant and some of the nicest owners I have ever met.  They make you feel so welcome.  Totally unique place to eat in the valley.

First visit there today and was impressed! I think i got a spicy italian sub-  meat was very flavorful. Wheat bread was ok. im looking forward to going back and trying a croissant sandwich. They also have zipps chips which are amazing and most places dont carry. Staff was friendly too..

I got the regular one hour facial as a gift for my birthday.  It was so wonderful and relaxing. I felt so pampered afterwards. No breakouts in the following week, just refreshed skin!! The place is also super cute and clean. Will be back for sure.

So I've lived in Gilbert for a year, and just managed to discover the farmer's market a few weeks ago.  Now I really feel like I was missing out on what could be a Saturday morning tradition.  Much better than I expected it to be and fun being able to buy from local vendors.  My favorite purchase was a Cabernet Cheddar Cheese.  Oh my YUM!  I wish I could remember who the vendor was.... either way I will be back for sure!

I would like to start off by saying that I previously really enjoyed my experiences here...until mother's day.  I spent $54 for 2 tickets to sit in the upgraded seats.  I was led to my seat by the staff and got comfy, ordered drinks etc.  I was then told by some crazy lady looking for an argument that I stole this older couples seats- because they thought I was in their assigned seats.  (I didn't steal the seats, nor was I in the wrong place) So a rather ridiculous argument ensued.  I asked the waiter if I was in the correct seats and was told yes.  For some reason, this woman kept pursuing the matter, I told her to shut up and leave me alone and she went to get the manager to have me "kicked out" of the theater.  So the manager came and asked to see my ticket, then said Yes I was in the right seats (again!).  Then he told me to "Drop It" and walked away after I explained what this woman was doing.  I thought that was handled quite poorly by the manager after being harassed by this woman.  It was totally embarassing and I was just trying to give my mom a nice day.  When I pay this much to see a movie, I don't ever want to hear "drop it" when I am displeased...especially after frequenting this place many times.  An "I'm sorry" would have been much nicer!!!

Love this place. Took the mother in law out for her birthday and couldn't have had a better experience. Try the fair trade short ribs. They are fall off the bone tender and the sour cherry BBQ sauce is an incredibly unique flavor. Service is quick and friendly. Lots of fun cocktails to sample. Side wall opens out to the patio- so you can enjoy the fresh air inside when the weather is nice.

Sandra was reccommended to me by a friend who had a bridesmaid dress altered (due to pregnancy) and her friend who had her wedding dress altered.  Sandra altered my wedding gown in 3 sessions and it turned out perfect, fit perfect!  She has a good eye and upon doing my final fitting decided to throw something in last minute which improved the dress even more.  She was also very kind.  My only quite small complaint was that she always seemed to be running a bit behind and I ended up spending some time waiting for each appt.  Prices are great also.  I was trying to avoid alterations at David's Bridal due to a friend's horrible experience and Sandra really came through.

So very pleased with Susan's service.  I had a bridesmaid dress that needed 3 layers of material hemmed.  I was freaking out, because I did not try the dress on ahead of time and only had 1 day left until the wedding.  I found Susan on Yelp and texted her quite early in the morning.  She got back to me immediately.  She was able to get me in that day and had the dress ready in under 24 hours.  What a relief- it turned out perfect!

I love Postino's.  I am slightly biased because my husband proposed to me here, but the reason he did so was because we went on our first real date to Postino's (Arcadia) and had such a wonderful time.  You really can't beat the bottle and board specials.  And their bruschetta is still the best- other wine bars in the valley just can't compete with it! The tomato jam is amazing!  Only downside is it's always paaacked with people and often a long wait.  Very good service- water always full!

The views are cool, but the service was just terrible. We had a party of about 12 people and it was next to impossible to order let alone receive our drinks. They also didn't even have Captain Morgan which seems like a pretty standard rum to have.

Great place to stop for quick lunch! They have a variety of tasty salads, sandwiches and soups. I also love any place that incorporates fruit on their salads. Each meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry- so how can you go wrong? Loud, bustling place so expect to see that! Prices are very reasonable.

I'm kind of obsessed with this place. Not because it has the greatest salads on earth, but because it has a drive through and walk up window. Having never seen a fast food salad place before this is quite a novelty. Plus it is really cheap and pretty good quality. I always get the Cobb with steak.

Simi's is fabulous. Everyone is so friendly and provides great service whether you are dining in or getting take out.  Restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's clean and decorated nicely inside. Good place for families. Try the orange chicken- you won't be disappointed.

Large brownie cheesecake samples which are awesome. Packed and very loud, so that threw me off a bit. Chicken salad had way too much mayonnaise- could be much better. Croissants were very soft and tasty. Wonderful selection of desserts.

I'm not sure what to say about this place, but it seems that they don't have their stuff together. At a "tap" house my husband and I were sat at table with no drink menu on the table and nor were we offered one- had to ask to see beer selection.  Ok fine- got our beers- Orange Blossom and Kiltlifter. They were good.  Ordered food- pork sliders, stuffed mushroom, wings. The stuffed mushroom was pretty tasty. However the wings were dry and the pork sliders were soggy and seriously tasted like tuna from a can. I'm not really sure how that happens and I don't want to know. My husband ordered a cocktail (amaretto sour) and I tried to warn him that this did not seem like a good cocktail kind of place. I was right, and it was positively terrible. Our server was nice. Overall just an underwhelming experience. Don't have plans to return.

Love the new office! Sean and Veronica  are very professional and knowledgable regarding different massage techniques.  They are focused on customizing your massage to whichever areas are giving you the most trouble. Working as a nurse- I destroy my back on a fairly regular basis. It is so nice to see a massage therapist that is really listening to what your needs are. Looking forward to an appointment with Veronica this weekend!  Would highly recommend- such a better experience than the chains out there.  Easy to schedule on-line as well!
