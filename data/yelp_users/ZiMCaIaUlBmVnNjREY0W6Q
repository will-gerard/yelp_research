In all seriousness, if I could give Phoenix Skin 10 stars, I would without a moments hesitation.  Phoenix Skin's attention to detail and commitment to a fantastic patient experience starts from the moment you step into their beautiful, modern, clean waiting room. I have had a battery of treatments (surgery, rashes, dry scalp, mole removal, laser hair removal, botox, aesthetic treatments and on and on...) there and every single experience has far exceeded my expectations.  Dr. Laris' bedside manner is second to none. A couple of years ago, Dr. Laris performed an otoplasty procedure on me. He took the time to explain the process and technique and answered all of my questions with the utmost of care. The outcome was not only natural results, but a boost in confidence after a weight that I had carried around my entire life had finally been lifted. From surgical procedures to botox injections (shhh...), Dr. Laris' skillful hands deliver tasteful, natural enhancements that make you feel like a better version of yourself.  His staff are equally amazing, which is no small feat! From the front desk staff to the nurses and PAs, everyone treats you with the utmost respect. I've been seeing their aesthetician, McKenzie, for laser hair removal treatments for a while now and I can't stop going back for more once I finish an area. McKenzie is very attentive and has a bubbly personality. She's helped me clear my "bacne" through a series of peels and treatments. Her services have also improved my quality of life immensely!  Lastly, I recommend Phoenix Skin to all of my friends and family. My mother had skin cancer removed from her lip by Dr. Laris and countless friends of mine (including my husband) have been getting their once-thought-it-was-the-best-idea-ever tattoo removal done by Caitlin and their state-of-the-art PicoSure laser. I would highly recommend this practice to you and your loved ones, too.

Chapter 1: Bourbon Street As A Roller Rink  Bourbon has all the charms of your childhood roller rink. Black lights! Vending machines! Watered down soda! Popcorn!  Chapter 2: Bourbon Street As Mount Everest -- Act One  The women's toilet is located deep inside the strippers' locker room north of the DJ booth, due east of the vending machines. You really need a Sherpa to help traverse the mounds of hair extensions and treacherous piles of Pleasers.   Chapter 3: Bourbon Street As Mount Everest -- Act Two  If you're lucky, you can also happen upon the most entertaining conversations (usually about money, material items, estranged children, etc.).  Then, breathe a sigh of relief as you emerge from the clouds of cheap perfume and glitter -- you've conquered it. A regular ol' Jon Krakauer, and hopefully you still have all your limbs.  Chapter 4: Bourbon Street As A Courtroom  Ladies and mainly Gentlemen of the Jury, for the record, no "22 year old" likes/or even knows WHO the Meat Puppets are. Furthermore, I submit to you, anyone who chooses 'Possum Kingdom' by the Toadies as her main stage song is well into their thirties. Guilty. I rest my case.

I asked a tie-dye clad clerk if they carried trash bags and he blinked hard several times as if squeezing out brain nuggets, then looked around and pointed to a trash bin next to the dairy case.   I shook my head and said, "No, I mean, like, to purchase... for your home, kitchen."  He looked again at the bin and then lifted his hand half way to point to another receptacle a few feet away, stopped then replied, "Well, we have some in the back, but I don't think they're for sale."

LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF GRACIE O.  I, Gracie O., an adult residing in Phoenix, Arizona, being of sound mind, declare this to be my Last Will and Testament.  I revoke all wills and codicils previously.  My dying wish is to be cremated in Pizzeria Bianco's sooty wood fire oven.  Dalton will drive the hearse. Dave will officiate and say kind words about me. Erin will wear a black veil and weep over a life taken from this earth far too soon. The Twins will slide me into the fire on an extra large pizza paddle.  *R*est *I*n  *P*izza

I was here once. A reasonably sized girl broke her white plastic lawn chair and tumbled to the ground. I averted my gaze and tried to focus on my overpriced mediocre eggs benedict. My friend just laughed and laughed. I guess I should have ordered the mimosas, too.

Chef Christopher is not unlike a character crafted by (insert prolific author here). I wouldn't be surprised if his motto wasn't "if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself." Undoubtedly, he would wash dishes and bus tables if he could. The fact that he cannot control every second of the customer's experience is visibly painful.  The night's main course was salmon or chicken. Crippled by indecision, I finally landed on the boneless, skinless chicken, with a smear of asiago cheese, basil and garlic rolled in prosciutto. This coiled beauty lay napping in a pool of fresh corn polenta with aromatic tomato basil fennel sauce.  Cafe Monarch truly takes comfort food to the next level. My first bite was akin to stepping into a warm bath. Even the tap water tasted like home; a farm that I never grew up on. Truly honest, rustic food.  No visit to Cafe Monarch would be complete without a little chat from the Chef. He personally thanks every one of his customers for coming in and tucks away their comments and feedback for later analysis. The conversations are never disingenuous, but always intriguing. In between tiny sips of hibiscus tea from what appears to be a squat ceramic container that you store kitchen utensils in, he is quietly studying you and plotting his next meal.

Hands down, the best waxing experience I've ever had. Professional, clean, and inviting. My husband and I popped in on a recommendation from a friend, and WOW --- we left impressed and smooth.  They cleverly call their techs "cerologists," which combines "cera" (Latin for wax) with "ologist." Our cerologist, Ashley, was the epitome of professionalism and took time to answer all of our questions. She was meticulous and skillful. After the waxing, she took the time to inspect and pluck any and all stragglers with her magnifying mirror. It's also worth mentioning that they clearly use very high quality wax. It didn't leave behind any residue at all.   Finally, you must try the nostril waxing. I didn't even know this was a thing?!?! Total gamechanger. I'm a Waxing the City convert and will definitely be back.
