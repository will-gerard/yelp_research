Oh MexiCAN Oh MexiCAN!  Another Taco Tuesday success. 5 street tacos cafeteria plate I liked 2, loved 2 and uhh 1 Unique place for sure with culture. Watching the cook prepare his plates shows how much passion he has for the menu. I will be back for those NachoFries! ...to be continued.

I brought my GF here to prove that the hulk SmashBurger was better than 5guys. Bad choice of location! I've been to the camelback and avondale location and I was very satisfied. This Tempe Smash was dirty and a swing of the kitchen door, it was even more dirty in back EWW. The cashier lady was nice and helpful except for the price she gave me 17 bucks for two burgers "1w/Bacon&Jalenpenos" and fries...Ouch My Pocket! No doubt SmashBurgers are amazing just guess the two guys in back were more interested in the RapMusic and smiling or laughing at customers than making my burger. They messed up my order with condiments and burgermeat wasn't cooked correctly and tasted wack. Deciding to go back to complain I decided to waste my time on Yelp.  My GF loves when I'm wrong. Should've went with chinese...Ill go back to SMash but NOT Tempe Smash to prove her wrong.

All I have to say is WOW. This is a hidden gem for sure. I had the Smoked turkey Chorizo Gouda Cheese Avocado Crepe Burrito with a side salad . It tasted how it was decorated and it was beautiful  my only problem was I was done with my delicious Chai iced Tea before my food came out.

Great tacos! Clean and friendly atmosphere! Okay now here's my rant. IM STILL HANGRY! 13$ for 2 tacos is real ridiculous! Don't get me wrong they were good but per taco is 6$ and some change worth? -Umm no! Good thing I didn't get a drink. Okay maybe just maybe if they threw another taco in there with just a tad more fish inside the tacos I would given a 5 star. I suggest you try but be ready to pay.

Mmmm...That sweet pork doe! I really enjoyed this place. Come with a big appetite and wallet. Two burritos and one drink was 21$! Its a beautiful 79Â° and they didnt have their outside table set up for sitting. Smh overall the food speaks for itself. You need to try peeps but if you cant afford, Chipotle will do just fine.

This is my first FIVE STAR and I was kinda hesitant. It was my first time here, being the judgmental type I am I couldn't find nothing wrong with the place. Service was nice and fast. Price was cheap and accepted plastic. The #5 grilled chicken with lemongrass spread was delicious! Chicken was actually marinated and spread was sweet and tasty. The bread is what made me fall in love, it was so soft! If you have eaten Vietnamese sandwiches the bread is so hard it cuts your pilate; not here! Viet Coffee was amazing! I suggest this place.

If I could give this place a zero; I would. Wow the food is horrible. I'm sure Chinese people would be offended if they tasted Beijing Express. Any Asian restaurant that has crunchy rice- has problems. I am shocked this place has good reviews. Please don't waste your money and go else where.

Cowabunga dudes! If you're a pizza lover like myself then you are going to enjoy this place. Fired pie is simple and delish! Create your own pizza or salad. Wine and beer available. The cookie with ice cream top off this experience. I will be back.

"You can't park there; hotel only." Is what you will hear when you park in front of LoLo's . Haha wth!  they do have complimentary valet doe. I see you LoLo's! They step up their game with a new fantastic location-except parking of course- but wow the inside was beautiful. Not only do they have a bar now, the drinks are AWEsome! Props bartender  I got the DD order. You know! Haha I asked for one of my fried breast to be smothered southern style and OrgasmMouthGoodness! Had to knock of a star due to the parking issues and waitress. God she was horrible. Seem like just her though because everyone there seemed happy.  Job well done LoLo's.  Moving on up!

OH MY GOOD! Asian AND Italian food is genius! Because I love both! Tuscan Fresca Noodles were fantastic! I wish I would've got the regular size bowl instead. I will definitely be back.
