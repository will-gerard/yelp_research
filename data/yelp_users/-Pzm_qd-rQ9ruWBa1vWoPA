So far, I think I found my second home.  although I say that after many beers and shots. Lol. This is a classic old school bar.  Wonderful!  Shady characters, hot countryfied bar tenders and actual cowboy hats!  Be warned, although this place has charm, its no Applebees or Olive Garden thank God!  I ordered beef tacos and a salad and both where great - for bar food.  After a few beers and a shot, it tasted fantastic lol!  I'll be back!  They only accept cash so bring some. There is an ATM but stop by the bank if you can.

Typical sports bar with a clean and open atmosphere.  Found a great seat quickly off to the side of the busy bar where I could people watch.  My server, Ennio was johnny-on-the-spot with a menu and drink suggestions. He even suggested waiting a few more minutes for the 10pm happy hour!  I gratefully accepted and respect him for informing me!  He came back promptly at 10pm for my order.  I decided to trythe the Parmesan garlic chicken wings, a shot of Di Saronno liqueur and a tall Blue Moon with an orange slice to wash it all down!    What can I say! Everything was superb! The Parmesan garlic wings where cooked to perfection, the garlic parm sauce was OMG delicious! Not to garlicky with plenty of the wholesome Parmesan cheese flavor!  Celery sticks arrived but sadly, accompanied by a teeny weeny ranch sauce which was much to scrawny with only a half shot or so of ranch dressing for dipping. I definitely expected more dippy sauce for a half dozen wings and a load of celery sticks.  A place like this should know better than to go skimpy on sauce! Shaaaaame!  Hahaha!  Over all, I thoroughly enjoyed the food, drinks and atmosphere. The staff was fully attentive and happy to serve.  I'll be back with friends for sure.

HANDS DOWN the Best pharmacy out there!  These people know their job, are friendly, courteous and professional in every way.    The parking situation is not so great as their building is attached to the hospital and shares the same parking lot but everything else makes up for that! Believe me!  Grab a drink next door at the caf√©, BS with the pharmacy staff or read your Kindle while you wait.    There is a nice patio with tables and chairs right outside the doors of the pharmacy, great for when it cools off.    I enjoy using this pharmacy because they don't "grief me" for filling my pain med scripts ON TIME like EVERY OTHER PHARMACY I've ever used.   Imagine it!   No inordinate wait and no evil power hungry pharmacists laughing at you as you writhe in pain... Ok, maybe it's not that bad but when you are in pain, it may certainly feel that way.   Just don't abuse your meds and you won't have any problems here.

As far as hardware stores and home improvement goes, I always go to this Ace Hardware before Lowes or Home Depot.  At this location you're almost always greeted at the door and asked if you need help finding anything.  If so, I have found, every employee fully versed on locating specific items or quickly pointing you to another person who does.  The staff is always VERY helpful and curteous. Not at all like some of the "miles of isles and stacks of racks" home improvement stores.  The only reason I did'nt give 5 stars is due to once in a while, having to special order or find it somewhere else.   But generally they have everything needed for standard home improvement projects.  The most important reason I shop here is they love dogs and allow leashed friendly animals in where other stores forbid it.  I bring my black lab with me every visit.  She loves the biscuits at the checkout counter too!

I dropped into Augie's about 10pm Saturday night because as I drove past, the outdoor patio was jammed with people dancing to a live band which sounded great.  While clean and easily accessible, my first opinion once inside was, Yep... its a sports bar.  The live band I have since been told, was named "Thaddeus Rose" playing 70s to modern top 40s music and was really great! Had the crowd of very mixed ages (children as well) dancing, laughing and enjoying themselves when I arrived.       The help was friendly offering me a drink and a menu a few minutes after I sat down.  I might add, it would have been better to get my order immediately rather than leave me sitting there - uncomfortably alone and empty handed - for a few minutes to long.  If I had NOT been alone, it would not have mattered as much.    The beer was ice cold however and once I got my first beer, the staff was great, offering a menu as well.  If you are a sports fan, you'll love all the games and sporting events displayed on the televisions surrounding the bar and eating area.   The prices on food and drinks seemed alright but again, I did not sample any food here so I can not comment on that aspect but the atmosphere was nice and not to loud. (at least inside by the bar.).  On a sided note, the mens' bathroom was out of hand towels so I had the pleasure of air drying my hands, on my pants.    It is NOT the kind of place I'd bring a first date but I plan on going back with friends to watch a game or two and do some drinking.

I've been bringing my dog to Banfield Pet Hospital inside PetSmart at 1561 N Dysart Rd, Avondale, AZ 85392  for about 4 years now and love this pet hospital.  The staff ALWAYS treats me well, are friendly and accommodating and seem genuinely concerned about my pets health.  I've never had to wait long if I had an appointment either.   Stop paying private vets thousands of dollars for stitches or x-rays when Petsmart Banfield hospital does the same thing for about $40/mo when you enroll your pet/pets on their pet insurance plan.  They get 6 month check-ups, free x-rays and bunches of other great perks when you get on a health plan.   A WHOLE YEAR at Banfield can costs less than ONE VISIT to a regular unscrupulous vet when your pet is in a serious accident of fight.  I switched to Banfield because I felt most of the privately owned vets organizations always seem more interested in finding out IF and HOW I COULD PAY and then HOW MUCH, rather than helping my pet and private vets almost never cost me less than $300 a visit!  Regardless of the treatment or problem.  They shaft you on x-rays, stitches or meds, every time!  That pretty much stopped when I started using Banfield!  Believe me when I say it is well worth the money!  My brother and his wife were spending thousands of dollars, several times a year on outrageous and unscrupulous vet bills until they switched their 3 dogs and 5 cats to Banfield.  One monthly fee and it covers almost everything. I've also had my dog in for grooming and nail trimming at the doggie spa in this location and they're fantastic as well!  Clean facilities and well managed staff.  The Vets can even offer alternative medications and treatments if money is tight and you explain your wants, needs and requirements.    Thank you Banfield for taking the bite out of my pets healthcare.  Lastly, as far as some of the bad reviews of this Banfield pet hospital by other Yelp! patrons, I doubt they are legit or are written by sly competitors who want to take more of your money and don't want the competition!  Come see for yourself before you deny your pet and wallet a fair deal.    Other than ONE longer than anticipated wait for an appointment which I SHOWED UP LATE FOR, I have never been treated rudely or seen any incompetence by staff or doctors whatsoever.  I've always been treated professionally and my dog and her health are all the better for it.    Everyone at the Dysart Rd in Avondale, AZ  Location is fantastic, friendly and professional!  Good luck with your pets health no matter your decision!

Don't be afraid!  Go get a massage!   I love Massage Envy for what they offer.  Affordable massage.  Always clean and nicely kept, great scheduling and convenient locations valley wide.  They offer many other services as well, facials, heated towels, mineral/therapeutic oils etc.  Even some over-priced aroma therapy nonsense but hey, if it works for you, great!  The rooms always smell delicious and the music relaxing. Heated towels and beds make for a great relaxing massage.  Overall, the therapists are polite and well intentioned but seem to be hit or miss for how I like my massage.  If you find a good one, stick with him/her.  I went through about seven before I found my favorite - And I'm not telling who!  She is always booked way out if that helps narrow it down a little.  The only problem I have seen is a high turnover rate among employees.  All in all, Massage Envy accounts for an hour or two of absolute "me time" which everyone should experience at least once a month, if not more!  For the money, I believe Massage Envy is worth a look and, assuming you find a therapist who works for you, a wonderful value.

If you want fantastic hot dogs and remarkable tasty desserts made with a bit of class and fun, this is the place!   The food is delicious with a clean and family friendly atmosphere.  I happened to drop in on a day the owners where working and they made my day!  Friendly folks who pay real attention to detail and make it more than just a meal, its lunch and a show!  You won't leave hungry either, portions are huge, the hot dogs are outrageously delicious, prepared with a smile.  Juan, their hot dog engineer is a great guy who goes out of his way to make sure you enjoy your visit and your meal. All and all I give Ivy League Dogs 5 stars and more if the scale went higher.  You'd have to be a red headed step child, to not fully enjoy this place for a casual outing!

I give one star cause I think it sucks they had to close their doors!   I loved this place.  I know they have been closed for some time now... Sad every time I drive past.   Support your local mom-and-pop-shops and small businesses in YOUR AREA!   Stick IT to MegaCorp and Tasteless Fast Food establishments! Ivy League!  You are MISSED!  So very missed!  ... Moment of silence... Thank you for your oh so yummy and deliciousness while it lasted!
