Sorry Egg & I, Hash House, Blueberry Hill and all the other Vegas breakfast spots - you've been replaced.  I've been here 3 times now over my last few trips to Vegas and I have always been delighted. Their floor show sandwich with a side of fruit has become the magic cure for my hangovers (turkey, sprouts, avocado, yum!) and I've also stolen bites of the pumpkin pancakes, salmon benedict and josephina omlette, all of which were delish.  I don't understand why they aren't more busy, but I'm not complaining because I love being able to walk in and grab a table without a wait on 10 am on a Saturday. The coffee is a little better than the average restaurant, which is nice to not have to swing by a legit coffee shop after breakfast to get enough caffeine to function.

Everytime we come to Vegas, we come here at least once. The service is great and everything we've ever ordered has been amazing and left us barely able to walk back to the car. The boyfriend got potato pancakes this morning that nearly burnt his throat they were so fresh but he claims it was worth the pain. I got an omelette that never possibly could have been finished by a single person. Ok, maybe that's not true, but I surely would have felt like vomiting if I had eaten the whole thing. I also have fond memories of the blueberry pancakes and a pecan waffle of some sort. If I recall correctly, I think I really wanted to drink the syrup that came with the pecan waffle. Yes, it was that good. Leave the strip. Go drive way far away to blueberry hill because the time spent eating and the nap required after will kill enough time to keep you from losing all your money at the blackjack table.

How have I not written a review yet!?! I come here everytime I'm in Vegas for at least one meal. Breakfast is the fave but dinner and lunch are just as good too. It is slightly better quality than what you would expect based on the price. Don't expect high-end fancy strip buffet food; It's good but also remember how much you paid. It is far from the strip and if we didn't ALWAYS drive to Vegas I wouldn't come, it wouldn't be worth the cab fare. It is worth the drive though because it's nice to get away from the strip, the food is good & cheap and the casino is much more inexpensive to gamble in than strip casinos.

We stayed here for one night last week and I would definitely stay again. We booked a cheap package that included an upgrade to a strip view, a few free drinks and a buy one get one free breakfast. Couldn't get the check in girl to upgrade us any extra but the room was close to the elevator, pretty & new looking and had a decent view of the strip. It wasn't amazing but for the price ($90) it was perfect. I give them extra stars for paying for our trip. Yes, we actually left with more money than we came with. The boyfriend kept coming back with black chips from the blackjack table and I was having a grand old time with the penny slots. First I won $75 on some insane bright flashing penny slot, then I won $200 on one right by the door. Yes, $200. On a $2 bet. Good times! We saw Zumanity while we were here too which was awesome though alot of the audience seemed really uncomfortable. Look, it's Vegas! Where else can you see hot naked flexible people!?! Anyway, it was one of the less expensive Cirques we've seen and I'd totally see it again.

Long long complainy story short: I will never stay here again.  I checked in at 9pm on a Saturday, had booked a non-smoking room and at check in, tipped the girl and asked for either a strip view or upgraded room. She said neither were possible because they're super busy. Ok, fine, I get a room over the parking garage on the 2nd floor. I walk in and it smells like someone just smoked a whole pack of marlboro reds. I forgot to ask, she forgot to tell, it's a super stinky smoking room. I call down asking for options: different room? pay for an upgrade? transfer me to another mgm property? refund? No, No, No, No. Apparently, I got the last room in the hotel at 9pm on a Saturday. Right, Claire, Very-rude front desk girl, I don't believe you.  In the morning I go down with the boyfriend down to talk to the manager (I hate that guys can get more done in this world, but oh well). And after a talk with him, he offered us a "Player's Suite" in the tower, but still no view of anything good. When I asked about a strip view he said we could have a one bedroom suite with a strip view for $50 more. I kinda felt like that should have been given after the 3 phone calls and in-person complaint but whatever. The "Player's Suite" isn't a suite. It's a normal size room that has a couch instead of a table and chairs and a mini-fridge. The hall also STUNK of old food and ciggs because some very classy people had left they're room service tray in the middle of the hall with cigarette butts thrown in drink glasses.  Awesome.  They get 2 stars for me winning $50 at a penny slot and giving me a mini fridge to keep our booze cold in. I can't handle bad customer service, especially for how much competition there is in Vegas! I'd much rather stay ANYWHERE else on the strip!

Unless I'm taking someone to Vegas who has never been, I refuse to stay on the strip. I just stayed at GVR for the first time last week and will probably be doing so again because it was pretty awesome. I'm still a huge fan of the M, but it seems like there's always an event happening at the M when I want to go which makes the rooms way too expensive. The room here was affordable, big, clean and nice enough (though just a bit stuffy decor wise).  The resort fee is pretty high (I think about $25night), but just keep it in mind when you look at the room rate - they clearly list it on their website when you're booking so it shouldn't be a surprise. It's handy that there is a mall type thing attached to give you more choices for dining that just what's inside the resort.  I could see the pool getting crazy busy on the weekends because it is a bit on the small side, but during the week it never filled up and is a really nice space. Use of the fitness center is also included in the resort fee, which was a big plus because really, with all the eating and drinking that happens in Vegas, a workout helps a lot.  The casino here wasn't super lucky for me, but that's fine, it just gave me more incentive to go relax by the pool and save myself the cash.

This review is for the frozen custard only and holy crap, yes, FIVE STARS FOR CUSTARD.  I've lived my whole life on the west coast. Do you know what we don't have nearly enough of on the west coast? Frozen Custard.  I'd spent a few summers in Illinois as a youth and my favorite nostalgic fat kid memory is eating Culver's with my aunt. My dude and I were in Tempe to run a half marathon and what better justification for eating the most calorie laden of all desserts than a 13 mile run? We had eaten a huge lunch a few hours earlier, so we only drove through for custard (yes, this was after the run, hence the desire to sit in the car and eat). I got a scoop of vanilla and a scoop of chocolate in a waffle cone. Thankfully my dude got his own because once I tasted it I was NOT sharing.  It's probably good we don't have Culver's in California. I suspect I would have some self control issues if I had all the time access to treats this delicious.

So, I'd only ever heard horrible things about the Trop, but I was going with 2 girlfriend who ALWAYS stay here because they like the pool, it's cheap and it's easy to walk to the dueling piano bar at NYNY. Every time I"m in Vegas, I tip the check-in person $20 and ask for an upgrade. It works about 75% of the time. The girls had booked this and I chose to come at the last minute, so to avoid paying the extra cash for 3 people, I told them to tip and ask for an upgrade and I went to play penny slots while they got checked in. They'd booked the cheapest room possible for Friday & Saturday night. $20 later and we had a paradise parlor suite with two rooms, a king bed, a big couch, a wet bar and an AMAZING corner of the hotel, strip view. Seriously. The best view EVER and the place was big enough to have a party in. It was in the paradise tower which is guess is the newer one, so it was totally nice and clean. The pool is quite lovely. The garden cafe sucks. Decent food, AWFUL service. I did like that the casino was cheap. Nothing makes me sad like losing $15 at a time on a hand of blackjack. I seriously loved our room. I will definitely stay here again, I'll book a paradise room just in case the magic $20 doesn't work cuz I have a feeling I wouldn't want to be anywhere else in the place, but if I could get that suite again without having to pay a ridiculous amount of money for it, it would be awesome.

This was the epitome of a two-star "Meh. I've experience better." race. I've done big races, I've done small races, I've even done other R'n'R races and this was my least enjoyable half marathon experience to date. The novelty of running down the strip at night is cool, but the execution is still lacking.  My annoyance actually began at the expo because I am the person who wants to pick up my number and get the heck out of there. I hate that they funnel you through aisles of booths to escape because seriously guys, I'm not buying anything and it's all the same crap you have at all the other expos so it's not even novel. The one upside was that we came to the expo super late so they weren't charging for parking.  We'd chosen to stay at an off strip hotel because my preference is always to stay off strip, so we ran into some traffic getting to the start on race day - no big deal, we allotted extra time and were fine. What DID waste time and was annoying was the total lack of signage or volunteers who were capable of directing us into the starting festival for gear check. If it hadn't been that there was a large group of people having the same issue, we wouldn't have figured out where the hell to go.   I've done big races before that they try to estimate when your corral will be released (because if it's a 4:30 start but your corral wont' go until 5:05 there's no reason to make you stand around). I would have really appreciated that because there were just SO many people running in SO many corrals, it did take a good 40 minutes after the clock time to get going.   The course itself was fun while on the strip, but as other people have stated in their race reports, everything from the strip over to Fremont really needed better lighting and course support because it still felt super sketchy. I personally had a pretty slow run due to coming off being sick and getting terrible sleep the night before, but I think I was securely middle of the pack and they were out of GU by the time I got to the GU stop. As much as I appreciate all the volunteers at the water stops, giving them a quick professionalism talk before the run wouldn't have hurt either. Many of them were too busy goofing off with each other to keep the cups on their table filled with water or they wouldn't think to tell the runners standing around waiting that the next table had more pre poured cups.  Once I got done shuffling along for 13.1 miles (I'm slow, I already mentioned that), the finish area was just more annoyance. I couldn't find bottled water. Whatever, it's fine, I'll take a gatorade. I had seen the bagels and apples sitting out baking in the sun hours and hours earlier, so no thanks to those. Being forced to walk through the massively long finishers area when I didn't want ANY of the things they were offering (No times a million, I DO NOT NEED A FINISHER PHOTO!) was lame and I would have been super happy if they'd had participant exits on the sides. I get the need to make it a secure area to limit people coming in, but it's ridiculous that they can't let finishers out. It literally look me 15 minutes to trek from the finish line to the end of the secure area with all the people and crap they were being given.  I would be much more forgiving of the event because I get that it is a truly unique experience, but it's way too expensive to not be awesome. Deep down I'm glad I did it - but I'll never do it again; It's just not worth the cost and annoyance.

I was in Charlotte for an interview and after spending my morning getting interrogated with tough technical questions, I needed an afternoon drink (or 3) to get my good mood back. I'd bookmarked a handful of breweries but was bummed to find that none of them were open as early as I was ready to go tasting, so when I saw that Heist was open early AND had food, I headed straight over and found myself a seat at the bar.  I didn't know much about their beer before arriving, but was delighted to discover that they do a great balanced Belgian. Louisa, my awesome bartender was happy to let me try a few things, recommend new options based on my preferences and even told me I made the perfect choice for lunch in going with the mac and cheese flatbread (carbs on carbs, you guys!). I tried most of what they had on tap and selected three different pints, my fave being the Out to Pasture. Nothing was two sweet and they did have an american style IPA on tap for those of you that prefer a hoppier beer.   It was busier than I would have thought for Friday lunchtime, so good for them for being busy. If I ever find myself back in Charlotte I'll totally be back for more yummy beer, pretty good food and awesome service.

A variety of delicious beers, friendly staff and a not too busy atmosphere. What more could you want? Oh, you're hungry? Yeah, well, there's a food truck outside too! This tasting room is seriously the only thing from our whole weekend in the Phoenix area that made me sad that I'm not a local.  We came in the night before the Rock and Roll Half Marathon with the intent of having a beer each... and then ended up trying pretty much everything they offer because it was so affordable, everything was tasty and we just didn't want to leave. I drank MANY IPAs over the years I lived in Seattle and I think their American IPA is one of my favorites - heavy on the hops without being too citrusy. I definitely woke up the next morning thinking I should have had more water and less beer the previous evening but beer has carbs, which must be good for running, right?  They had a couple of TVs and tons of board games, along with a little outside area to sit. We opted for outside and because it's in a business park it was super quiet, which was perfect and not what you expect for going out on a Saturday evening for a beer. Four Peaks, you're my favorite thing in all of Arizona for sure!

We stayed here this past weekend as it was super conveniently located to the start and finish lines of the Rock and Roll Half Marathon. We checked in late in the day on Saturday after driving out from LA and having spent the evening getting our race packets in Phoenix and drinking beer at Four Peaks. The guy at check in (I think his name was Dan) was extremely friendly, energetic and efficient.  We were pleasantly surprised by how modern, clean and well appointed our room was. It had an actual full kitchen (pots and pans, dishes, dishwasher, full size fridge), a little couch, a queen sized bed and a tiny balcony with a view of nothing. Literally, my only complaints about the room were that I wished it had a king bed rather than a queen but I know that I'm being picky and a queen bed is totally sufficient and that the climate control was easier to figure out because I totally had a fight with that thing. The control panel has 3 buttons - a red arrow up, a blue arrow down and a fan button. I could not for the life of me figure out how to switch it to JUST fan so the AC or heat wouldn't cycle on and off every 10 minutes. Then the unit started making a weird bomb like ticking sound, so we just gave up and switched off the power to it in the breaker box so then it was a little stuffy, but we dealt.  We missed breakfast the next morning because we overslept and were rushing to get to the run on time, but we did swing by on our second morning there and it's a standard free breakfast - weak coffee, plentiful carbs (bagels, oatmeal, cereal, muffins) and a few hot choices (scrambled eggs, potatoes and potato/sausage mix) but it was enough to keep us from being starving for the earlier part of our drive.  What is really special was that the pool, spa and firepit that are on the roof are open 24 hours. We didn't take advantage of any of that because there were some college girls gathered chatting around the firepit drinking wine and we were so tired all we wanted was quiet, but so many hotels I've stayed at close the pool at 7 which is WAY too early.  I don't forsee a reason to go back to Tempe in the future, but I would absolutely recommend this hotel as a solid option if you're looking for something clean and convenient in the area.
