Note: My rating assumes that you are a beef-loving carnivore - steer clear otherwise.  Having never lived in a state in which In-N-Out operates, I always take the chance to visit whenever fate reasonably regularly leads me to Arizona or California.  Bible verses printed on their serving paper materials (which are thankfully unobtrusive) aside, I am all for this place. They pay their workers better than other fast food places and make everything fresh, and granted my experience is limited, but even though it may take a while to get my order, I've never had communication difficulties or an actually unpleasant cashier and I'm sure there's a correlation there somewhere.  The fries are shoestring style and salty; if you like heartier fries, stay away. The burgers are great with grilled onions (found in the "Animal Style" but can be requested otherwise.)   A word of warning that may not be stated clearly by In-N-Out's disciples - the burgers are thin, which puts off my parents who grew up on and strongly prefer half-pound burgers, but even they can appreciate the sub-$1 coffee.  That said, choices are pretty limited if you're vegetarian or don't eat beef, and the menu is very small. They do what they do very well, but it's not for everyone.

Arrivederci, a southern Italian enclave in the midst of a strip mall in the desert, can boast the rare designation of a dining choice that was not a compromise candidate between members of my family. Granted, I might have just been weak from the travel, but I was enthusiastic to satiate a hunger difficult to address in my homeland.  I was not disappointed with what we found. An owner who greets patrons with "buena sera!" in a thoroughly non-corporate, warm, mood-lit setting is always a good sign. Many patrons who respond back in Italian and conduct themselves like they're at their second home are an even better sign, even if the restaurant was a bit empty.  The true test, of course, is the food. No amount of show or neighborhood family feel could compensate for a massive kitchen deficiency. Fortunately, it wasn't required:  - Bread: Uninteresting... except I could drink the accompanying pesto and oil mix. - Minestrone (~$5): The lowlight. A case of nothing ventured, nothing gained. Skip it. - Gnocchi in pink vodka sauce with salmon (~$19): Let's just say I was highly looking forward to the leftovers as two separate snacks.  - "Choco"misu (~$7): Much hullabaloo is made about the addition of the ingredient, but it really just came off as above average tiramisu. - Cannoli (~$5): Always ridiculously unhealthy, but here it's made properly with ricotta and the texture is spot on enough to justify it.  Arrivederci is an excellent "corner" restaurant in a land lacking a bit in both deviance and corners. More importantly, it clearly passes the "would survive in NJ as-is" test. There is nothing left to say.

In my land of residence, Southwestern Reflections would be called "Made in Washington" and similarly contain more items emblazoned with local namesakes than anyone would ever want. While it is among the requirements to properly furnish an airport in a major tourist destination, it instead stands proudly in a shopping village.  One might think there would be not much more to say. It certainly boasts the usual kitschy decorations, overpriced Scottsdale T-shirts, overpriced Southwestern T-shirts, slightly punchy novelty cards, and the entire line of Danger Men Cooking merchandise. (I appreciate the idea, but did this brand need its own hot sauce? Really?)  However, one piece of merchandise caught my eye and has led me to consider that there may actually be more depth here. Rotating racks contained standard mild attempts at cleverness and retro pop culture clearly made for the masses like Betty Boop and Western-themed license plate-sized decorations.  One item stood apart: A plate featuring a stereotypical older Native American with long hair and a rifle, proclaiming "Homeland Security Since 1492."  I am still confused as to the intention of this plate in McCain's good ole' Republican Arizona, since to me this is a pretty clear "anti-American" statement of the rightful owners of this country. Is this intended to be ironic? An inside joke / "quality control" issue of a "maverick" employee at the manufacturer? Why is it here? Why has this not offended the standard tourist sensibility?  I'd like to give Southwestern Reflections the benefit of the doubt that they intentionally stocked this plate as a minor act of subversion, but that's probably wishful thinking. However, it livened up what could have been a completely drab visit, so I will give them some comedy credit. Otherwise, this store is exactly what you'd expect - if you're actually looking for this kind of thing, you've probably already been to six different gift shops resembling it at the tourist traps in your path, and otherwise, you have no reason to set foot in here besides possibly to marvel as I did.

Case File: NYPD Pizza Status: Unsolved  Wanted: Rogue "Pizzeria" Gang in the Southwestern United States. Last reported activity near Scottsdale, Arizona.  Dossier: The Hideout  - two floors - some sections of tile wall - built-in uniform flair taunting "amateurs" with the temerity to ask for takeout containers - busy but no wait at 6pm - a throng of people in the waiting area around 7:15pm - felt like Axel F should have been playing in the background  A well-designed disarming replica front of a NJ family pizzeria/restaurant.   Dossier: The Expendable Lackey  Garlic knots ($4, $5 with melted mozzarella):  - too airy - too light on the garlic  A dough distraction designed to lure the unsuspecting into the aforementioned ridicule.  Dossier: The Ringleader  A whole Sicilian pie shouldering on half of it the weight of roasted red peppers, mushrooms and spinach (~$22):  - not too oily - not too thick to be unwieldy - thick enough to not buckle - solid marinara whose flavor held its own - crowned with the tabletop offerings of crushed red pepper, oregano and garlic - just right to achieve bliss  Armed and extremely dangerous. After two slices, I could not resist consuming a third, desperate to savor one last taste before returning to the desolate pizza celibacy that is the Seattle metropolitan area.

I'm not sure if the Phoenix area has a sizable Persian immigrant population or whether the tiny numbers are just all at Persian Room, but I was surprised to see what looked like an authentic restaurant in a suburb on the edge of the desert that is far more concerned with money than even the semblance of diversity.  Since this was my family's first experience with Persian cuisine, we went with samplers all around. Coming from someone who appreciates the food, standouts were the eggplant hummus and the fesenjan I snuck in on the side.  I wish I could tell a story of redemption and enlightenment about how they came around to the variety of tastes but since they hate rice, flavor and change the results were somewhat predictable and this visit was likely ill-advised from the start.  The Persian ice cream (flavored with pistachio et. al.) was one of the few things to gain universal approval unlike the only actual miss of overly sweet baklava.  For huge plates of grilled meats, sizable varieties of rice, stews, fresh breads and subtly flavored sweets and everything else one would expect from Persian cuisine, especially in this area it's difficult to go wrong with Persian Room. Lacking a superpower that allows the instant digestion of grains, come hungry.

This place is tiny and generally crowded, even when Frontier Town is pretty dead, and there's so much stuff crammed into the space that it's hard to look at anything.  When I went here, given that I like spicy things, I was immediately drawn to the "food additive" section, the hot sauce that is so hot that for liability reasons they can't call it hot sauce, jars that contain substances with higher Scoville ratings than some pepper sprays and carry 5-point legal disclaimers.   Given that I'm in the latter half of my twenties, I'd like to think that I am not easily mistakable for a young teen who might need to be supervised, so the conclusion I can draw from what followed is that if you are under the age of 40 and walk over to look at this section, you earn the woman staffing the place walking over and standing next to you and staring at you until you leave.  She did somewhat explain herself, stating that if one were to accidentally drop the high-end stuff, it would be like launching tear gas into the store (great thinking for a cramped crowded location!), but still, if you don't want people looking at it, don't sell it or keep it behind the counter instead of being rude to customers.  As a touristy thing to see, it's not bad to I guess, and I didn't feel like I was cheated out of the 5-10 minutes of my life I spent in here, but if you're on the fence, I wouldn't bother, and I doubt anyone would have a reason to go back a second time. If you really want anything they sell here, order it online.

It's no secret that I'm not a huge steak fan, but since my parents like it and they were treating for dinner, I was powerless in the negotiation of venue and we went to Fleming's, an upscale steakhouse serving dead animals graded USDA Prime. Mmm.  Despite the mall location, the restaurant is dark and intimate and the bar looked inviting. My affinity for plastic is relatively low, and with the exception of the Scottsdale equivalent of a gangbanger (an adult frat boy bearing a backwards-turned cap indoors) and his Barbie doll/date, the only people who were in desperate need of recycling were the hostesses which was a pleasant surprise given the environs.  On the recommendations from a sweet but not saccharine waitress, we sampled: [NB: Prices are approximate, since Fleming's avoids website sticker shock.] - Starter platter (Gratis): Brie, olive tapenade and some crostini, celery and radish - a light start and a substantial improvement over the standard bread offering (which is also optionally served at entree time upon request) - Crab Cakes (~$15): Great crabmeat to breading ratio but not superlative as advertised - Sweet Chili Calamari (~$12): Expertly lightly fried, breaded and sweetened - Petite Filet (~$30): Dry, which is unfortunate in the most tender of steaks - Bone-in Ribeye (~$30): Very juicy and flavorful, significantly superior to the former - Beef Flemington (~$28): Filet Mignon in a light pastry shell and a Madiera sauce, juicy unlike the vanilla offering - a solid A - Dessert Sampler ($13):   - Creme Brulee: Divine vanilla goodness, I'd order it again and I'm not a general fan   - Cheesecake: Thoroughly unremarkable   - Chocolate Lava Cake: Overly sugary molten chocolate in a thin souffle-ish cake shell   - Peach Cobbler a La Mode: Proving the exception of the "less filler" trend, heavy on the cobbler but light on the fruit  Outside of parental benevolence, an expense account or a serious apology to a significant other from the heartland, I wouldn't be looking for a dining experience like this, but I'd come back if the time was right. Unlike other local high end steakhouses, Fleming's does it with more tender delicious substance than heavy oily pretension.

I once went to a perhaps unsurprisingly now defunct Trader Vic's in Washington for happy hour and was impressed by neither the food nor the drinks - this is not that story.  An almost empty restaurant (making our reservation comic relief) excluding the bustling bar area (slightly after the end of happy hour) on a holiday despite a well-decorated hall brimming with Tiki kitsch should have given us an indication, but since I was there for a family dinner with a picky family and this was already a compromise location, it was a bit late to change course(s), and among the goods for which we bartered were:  - Cosmo Tidbits ($22): Enough fried and meaty flavors for three but nothing of note. - Lamb Curry (~$27): A flavorless cream of lamb soup that would have made Campbell's proud as a special? I have no idea what the chef was thinking with this. - Polynesian Snowball ($7): Coconut-encrusted vanilla with chocolate sauce done well. - Chocolate Macadamia Nut Torte ($8): Adequate, appropriately sweet, but forgettable.  If I'd gone to Outback Steakhouse and paid commensurate prices, I would have been pleased with the results, and thus it might fare better for happy hour (despite a previous experience at another location) but for near Ruth's Chris costs I expect near flawless execution, especially on a special, the failure of which overshadowed the experience.  I can't decide if Victor Bergeron (the real life Trader Vic) was any or all of the following:  - A shrewd capitalist genius who traded pittances of mediocre food for large sums - A C team stock trader who went long on 25% odds based on our dining experiences - A victim of continued posthumous branding that has brought shame to his name - A one-hit wonderquack who never surpassed or fully channeled his Mai Tai "invention"  However, I have decided that I am comfortable leaving this islander mystery unsolved.

Tomaso's is classic (northern) Italian in an old country setting, straight up. I was concerned after hanging around Little Italy for a month that Arizona's fare would not measure up. I was wrong.  Granted, we did not have the standard experience as we came on Christmas Eve, but the staff was friendly and warm. As we watched food being served, it seemed the same dishes kept coming up over and over again, which is good since our rookie order overlapped:  - Tuscan Legume Soup ($8): Enjoyable but otherwise unremarkable. - Mozzarella Caprese ($13): Sized for two and executed excellently. - Fish Roulade ($29): Special of the evening was fish rolled with crab and lobster meat over spinach with lobster ravioli. How can one go wrong? One can't. - Scampi Caprese & Lobster Ravioli ($28): I'd call this a miss but I'm in the minority as my parents both enjoyed it and most of the restaurant seemed to agree. - The Best Lasagna Ever ($24): A bold claim, but this really was the best lasagna I've had in a very long time - balanced flavors and not too heavy.  For dessert, an adequate tiramisu was heavily overshadowed in both size and preference by a monster cannoli.   Tomaso's is a little on the expensive side but one is clearly paying for quality of atmosphere, service and food. It meets the difficult bar of somewhere on which both my meat and potatoes parents and I can agree. For a special occasion (or on an expense account) I'd definitely drop in again.

If one had asked me 10 years ago if I'd ever eat somewhere with the caliber and focus of an institution like Binkley's, I would have pondered for a minute and probably responded only if it was by the desire and grace of a girlfriend's sufficiently endowed parents or a reception catered by the Google Gillionaires I would surely be surrounded by as a result of a blossoming interest in the tech industry. If one had asked if I'd ever be there at the suggestion of my family who would be equally, if not more, at home at Claimjumper, I wouldn't have deigned the question worthy of response at all.  I would have been (at least temporarily) wrong.  At the behest of a curious mother living nearby for years, we ventured. Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety, Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings, and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks:  - Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame - Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine - Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home - Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus ($82 - $89, wine pairing $40-50 extra) like non-confused VIPs, but skipping the foie gras surcharge (+$14) - Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity - Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches - Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered - Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase, except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal - Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer, including a superb soft shell crab course - Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates - Starting to feel full around the penultimate course, an amuse of chocolate souffle  - Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free ($2.50) despite the staff's complete lack of hesitation in providing them - Taking home satisfaction levels ranging from grudgingly enjoying the expensive dinner show to thinking it was the best overall food experience in months if not years  Menu guidance would be a futile endeavor since, as the head waitresses helpfully informed all non-returnee tables, it turns over completely around every two weeks. However, overall, the seafood dishes were stronger than those with meat, of interest if one is opting for a menu with a single main. Instead:  - Prepare for the onslaught of Kevin Binkley's culinary whims - Pretend the a la carte menu doesn't exist - Make a reservation well in advance, especially for a weekend - Bring your wallet, possibly two - Expect to spend at least 3 hours luxuriating over the meal - Sigh longingly while realizing how far in the future the next justifiable visit will be  Regardless of apprehension, except in the face of a diet with statistically outlying strictness, it's worth trying once for a special occasion to form one's own opinion. While I could easily think of a number of small tweaks, the application of the formulaic main draw is, in Yelp's terms, semantically indistinguishable from as good as it gets.

Ben Avery, a 1600+ acre shooting range in desert Arizona outside of Phoenix, appears to be one of the more popular destinations on a Sunday afternoon, and among the highest that do not involve any kind of alcohol or controlled chemical substances. For the susprisingly low price of $7/shooter (targets around $1 or less) and the cost of one's own ammo, weapon, ear and eye protection, and after watching a five minute safety video, one too can let out one's aggression and/or boredom with lethal force in a legal fashion.  Call me a city slicker (an ironic descripton since I am more often derided as a dweller of suburbia) but, despite firing off about ten chambers worth of a family-owned .38 Special, and since talking is almost impossible over the sounds of gunfire during the shooting rounds, by far the most interesting thing here was the people watching. Besides a general feeling of having stumbled upon a casting call for extras for Red Dawn:  - The goth woman accompanied by the long haired hippie toting what appeared to be an assualt shotgun that I would have expected illegal and whose choice of target was simply a wooden board with no sheet that didn't stand a chance - The jolly older man with a .44 magnum who joked about using it as an anti road-rage deterrent from a moving vehicle - The hardcore sniper shooting at a target 500 yards away who needed to use a scope to see the results of his firing - Blonde, blue-eyed All-American children that couldn't have been over 10 firing pistols with a smile (and hopefully the gravity of the situation) - The ultimate hipster toting his rifle in a guitar case - The announcer who continuously reminded people over loudspeaker to stay away from the firearm tables during the ceasefire break which, after about the ten-thousandth time, must get old for them - Walter Sobchak (... not really on this one, but I was holding out hope)  I'll admit I don't have much experience with these facilities, but for an outdoor range with many other ranges to cater to competitive shooting, especially in ideal outdoor weather, Ben Avery seemed like a good place to spend a few hours for those averse to physical exercise (recoil-induced wrist-stretching notwithstanding) and for some father-son bonding. I'd implore you to be safe - but the friendly NRA-approved range master will remind you of that at least five times during the course of a normal visit.

Sweet Republic's namesake is apt in its home country, as it represents an almost patriotically capitalistic approach to frozen dessert - it is quite possibly the most expensive ice cream I've ever eaten in a venue solely targeting it, with a double ($4.50) that barely exceeded other boutique creamery's singles.  Fortunately, the quality and preparation are commensurate with the price, and unlike other hyper premium ice cream, it doesn't feel so loaded with fat that a toothpick is the ideal utensil (although a gelato spoon is still recommended to stretch out one's savoring, even with the larger sizes.)   It is worth noting predominantly that their approach is not for everyone. In a sense, I'd like to think that the cost is due to substituting subtle flavors of the stated ingredients as opposed to an excessive amount of sugar, a concept alien enough to balance out the patriotism to neutral. To put it another way, if sweet was one's only taste receptor, this would be the Wonder Bread of ice cream and one's visit, especially if cultured in hype, is likely to result in a subsequent trip through the stages of grieving.  If one is still reading, due to [excitement, cautious optimism] be sure to check out: - Real Mint Chip: I've simply never had ice cream that tasted like fresh mint before. - Desert Rose Honey: A nearly perfectly balanced tart yogurt that might ruin Cherry On Top, Golden Spoon, Red Mango, etc. forever.  Disapproval and further illustrating the C. family comestible preference distance was worth coming here - I just hope it finds enough audience in a steakhouse-rife land.

The memory of going to a Marriott in NJ for breakfast on a business trip and expensing $15 for what basically amounted to an unimpressive continental breakfast with an equally unimpressive omelet bar had not yet faded when my parents suggested coming to Blue Sage, the main dining room at the Desert Ridge Marriott, for Christmas Day breakfast due to a lack of a large group to justify making a complex meal and most places being closed. Even beyond that, I don't generally think of hotel restaurants as anything besides overpriced and above average at best, so I was... skeptical.  Arriving at 11:30, we were presented with a choice between the lunch menu (sandwiches around $14 + a la carte drinks) or the breakfast buffet ($22) since regular breakfast was no longer being served. After looking around at what can be best described as the expanse, we all opted for the latter, despite fears that this might be a breakfast redux of Todai. This feast, which is perhaps an understatement, included:  - continental breakfast offerings (scrambled eggs, yogurt, cereal, basic pastries) - made-to-order omelets with an array of fixings from feta to spinach to cilantro to smoked salmon to jalapenos to mild roasted salsa, egg whites available - succulent, flavorful chicken jalapeno sausage (and smoked bacon) - oatmeal with accouterments (brown sugar, pecans, dried fruit, etc.) - cheese blintzes with berry compote and roasted potatoes - better side of average apple cobbler, not overly sweet cinnamon rolls - fresh waffles and pancakes (included and ordered from the server) - myriad fresh fruit (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, melon, pineapple, etc.) - fresh whipped cream (NB: Combining the last three options can and will be hazardous to your waistline.) - standard morning beverages (coffee, juice, soda) (NB: Despite the habits of a sizable portion of the Yelp community, mimosas, wine, Long Island Iced Teas and/or 151 are NOT standard morning beverages.)  This is by far the best as well as largest Christmas breakfast I've ever had. It's also by far the most expensive Christmas breakfast I've ever had, but the quality and variety justified the occasion splurge. If you want your clothes to still fit, be very careful if you are staying at this hotel, especially on an expense account.

For those of us without large extended families available to share in the joy and pain in the preparation, consumption and cleanup of an extensive Christmas dinner, dining out tends to be quite attractive despite limited menus and staff frantically keeping up with the rush who could enumerate many places they would rather be, and thus my immediate wing of the C. clan embarked on the usual attempt to find an open place.  Meritage Steakhouse, portentously enough not overrun by a Baha'i convention we discovered on Christmas in the Desert Ridge Marriott that contains it, was this year's.  Meritage is confused. It looks like it changed hands a few times and kept aspects of each - the central area looks like a sports bar with tables added, a more wooden version of a Cheesecake Factory bar, but with side areas, receded booths and the requisite outdoor tables that look more like a restaurant in its price range. A modest attempt at holiday decorations made it worse instead of providing thematic clarity.  After perusing the a la carte menu, we all opted for the $55 prix fixe family style dinner, which while ample was thankfully a lot less jumbled than the environs:  - Goat cheese arugula salad: Unremarkable. - Squash soup: Sinfully thick and creamy, non-overpowering, and so guiltily good. - Beef tenderloin: Tender, soft spongy meat to absorb the maitre'd sauce and the butter. - Goose breast: Paling a bit compared with its sibling, in both taste and unhealthiness. - Brussels sprouts with ham: Tasty, but too much butter and oil to consume en masse. - Stuffing: Unremarkable. - Mashed potatoes: Equally unremarkable. - Creme Brulee: A bit on the overly creamy side, but still pleasing. - Chocolate: Chocolate cream between chocolate wafers. Sugar high. - Cheesecake: Diabetes, here we come!  Against fixed menu Christmas Dinner expectations, Meritage scored well, but the overall meal was too rich for my taste. Compromise candidates don't usually run this much so I'm unlikely to be back. If I did return to the Marriott for a meal, it would be for the brunch buffet at Blue Sage instead.

When traveling abroad, I've met multiple people from around the world who would tell me, after I said I was from the States, that they loved NYC.  I've generally replied that NYC is the United States in name only (based on the diversity and the absence of personal motor vehicle worship for a start) and if one wanted to see what 'murica is about and meet the "average [United States of] American" that one needed to get far away from there.  The Tortilla Flat rest stop is far away from there. Exploiting the legacy of the Lost Dutchman and tales of a likely fictional gold mine in the Superstition Mountains (I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried) to create a tourist trap for those "adventurous" enough to venture out in the 110-120 degree desert is also much more in line with the frontier spirit.  Almost everyone who visits here seems to be Caucasian and the average age of adults here is likely upwards of fifty. Call me a hopeless romantic but I'd like to think this is a sign of everyone else having figured out the only gold in them thar' hills is that which is transferred from visitors to the proprietors of this establishment.  No samples because we have no confidence in our products that cost more by volume than hipster favorite Churn, hate the customer if we can get away with it, and giving something away would be socialism. Why do you hate America?  In balance, it is hard to argue with Primus -- The Devil Went Down to Georgia playing anywhere when one walks in, although if Lucifer had found either pricky pear gelato or bottled water that costs more than soda I'm sure he would have been satisfied.  The Tortilla Flat stop is useful as a free bathroom in the gift shop if the kitsch doesn't overwhelm before reaching it but, otherwise, bring supplies if venturing out that way. The Wild Capitalist West preys on the unprepared.

I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to patronize an establishment called Culinary Dropout in the silicone cultural wasteland of Scottsdale. In a hipster mecca like San Francisco, Seattle or Brooklyn I'd just assume it was ironic but I wasn't sure the target audience would get it.  I'm not sure if it counts as de-gentrification but at least the management gets it.   Culinary Dropout is, straight up, excellent American comfort food at prices that aren't overall comforting but are reasonable for the neighborhood. The staff, for which a minimum beauty and/or edge standard is strictly enforced (the explanation that best explains a visible mohawk in the open kitchen) are friendly and help it along in a cavernous, moodlit dining room suitable for friends or a date along with a bar boasting live music on weekends and the obligatory fair-weather outdoor seating.  We hit two of the three specialties (the third being a turkey pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread) and a dessert: - Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue ($10): There's a reason everyone orders this. Fluffy pretzel rolls that are made better with a *small* amount of warm cheese. - Fried Chicken ($16): What must be multiple pounds of juicy chicken (I'm not sure I'd want to meet the chicken to which the breast piece belonged in a dark alley) with honey-glazed biscuits, mashed potatoes and cole slaw. - Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart ($6): For lovers of dense and sweet desserts only.  Especially if considering dessert, I'd strongly recommend ordering the pretzels and then one dish less than the number of people - comforting in the United States means heavy and even if I'd just hiked 10+ miles after not eating all day I don't think I could have finished the entire chicken platter. I just as strongly recommend coming though - it is one of the rare cases where my traditionalist meat and potatoes parents and I agree on a restaurant. Culinary Dropout has enough of a sense of humor as it can possibly maintain among plastic "charm" and the food makes me a bit wistful for whatever the chef would have produced had s/he not called it quits.

The best way to summarize my feelings towards Renegade Canteen is to share the following: As I was finishing family dinner here, I commented to them that I think this might be the first time they suggested a place with a spirit of enthusiasm instead of concession since moving to Arizona that I thought was worth it. (In balance, I'm not sure they loved it but at least they would go back.)  Excluding portion size, the upscale interpretative Southwestern-bearing Renegade Canteen is large and sprawling like its surrounding strip mall and city.   Normally service is an afterthought for me but this also proved to be an exception. Our waiter, who I shall not name because I think I might embarrass him, struck me as a displaced, awkward Southern gentleman from Manhattan who understood all of the trappings of true high-end American service but was insecure and defensive about them enough to explain why he was doing the right things. That said, an encyclopedic knowledge of the menu, a parlor trick memory of not writing down anything, the sense to not interrupt conversation flow and the flash of a personality stable against customer anger/assault contributed to the ultimate disarming beta to the food's alpha. Usually, anything outside of refinement or used car salesman puts off my family but somehow he succeeded in charming them and interesting me. It might have all been an act but an effective act it was.  The true star is the food. I'm often skeptical of restaurants whose websites contain a "chef's ego" section and talk about James Beard awards, but in this case it was worth it. Fitting with my general approach to dining, family style is the way to go here:  - Shrimp & Halibut Ceviche ($10): Tangy, refreshing, a superlative start. - Tortilla Soup ($9): Strong flavor but a bit too heavy and salty for a starter. - Spinach Salad ($9): The honey bacon, candied pecans and egg combine well. - Green Chile Pork Stew ($14): Basic, savory deliciousness - even a parent pleaser.  - Deconstructed Paella ($25): A little bit of everything - lobster, filet, chorizo + clams.  - Alaskan Hallbut ($26): Lobster sauce thoroughly trounces club sauce. - Flourless Chocolate Cake ($7.5): More cakes should use flan in lieu of frosting. - Pecan Pie ($7.5): The bourbon ice cream was unfortunately the highlight. Skip.   Outside of a special event, I'd come back for the more affordable happy hour if it wasn't a parental-funded excursion, but at least with the options and price range near Scottsdale, Renegade Canteen is a welcome statement against local norms.

I'll be honest and admit I really don't expect that much from dining in Phoenix outside the basics but Citizen Public House exceeded expectations. In short, Cowboy Ciao on steroids, which probably isn't an accident since it is owned by the former executive chef of the latter.   As both a date venue and a group outing for both cocktails and a full meal it delivers:  - Moe'scow Mule (~$10): A heavily poured Moscow Mule in a stylized metal urn with cucumber set the appropriate tone - Pork belly pastrami ($13): Paternal favorite and juicy, smooth merger of dishes - The Original Chopped Salad ($12): Not as good as proper Burmese Tea Leaf salad but worthy as the closest thing I've ever had out of Western salad canon - Lamb burger ($13): Well-executed with delicious thick fries with homemade ketchup  I need to return if for no other reason than to try the Bacon Brittle. I failed in that mission.  Even my parents liked the place despite the New American-ness and it's unusual for us to agree on anything that isn't a steakhouse. If there is any negative, it is that it is a bit pricey but more worthy of the occasional splurge than most other choices I've tried in or above the range in the area. If I lived in PHX I'd be here as often as wallet and heart/stomach permitted.

Churn is simply too good to be wasting away in Phoenix where only those who can tolerate 110+ Fahrenheit heat can experience it and a large portion of the populace is perfectly content with the likes of Baskin-Robbins and Cold Stone.  I've only been able to visit here once. Peanut Butter was almost too indulgent and the Vietnamese Coffee flavor is just perfect. If there was no condensed milk involved in the production of this ice cream, I'd be shorting Carnation if I owned any of it.  For the ultimate extravagance, consider the pretzel cone (+$1) for a salt vector that has nothing to do with caramel.  I hope Churn expands to other geographies while maintaining quality. Bi-Rite, Molly Moon's, Ample Hills, etc. should fear this possibility.
