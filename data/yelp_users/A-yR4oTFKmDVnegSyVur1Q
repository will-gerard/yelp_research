As I'm crusin' from PHX airport to my hotel, I randomly see a sign for this Indian restaurant and immediately hit the brakes and make a U-turn to stop in for lunch!  I had my doubts, really I did.  I don't ever do Indian buffets because its guaranteed to disappoint me so I opted for the regular menu.  Delicious shrimp madras is what I got (extra spicy) and garlic naan...yummy, yum, YUM!

So a client of mine picked this for dinner. I was shocked #1 that it was SUPER CASUAL (clients usually pick ultra high end spots for dinner when they know I'm paying...hehehe)!  #2 the sushi SUCKED.  I was really disappointed in the food.  Service was fine but it should be considering the food is sub-par and its a small mom & pop operation.

I had a great experience at this Hertz (but maybe because I had a horrible one at Payless that I am saying this).  Very friendly customer service.  Process is efficient.  I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. Can't beat it.

What is there NOT to love about LV?!  This particular store however did not have a great selection, hence the 4 stars.  Otherwise, all day everyday, LV rocks my world =)

This spot was recommended by a local that I trust with food choices.  Let's just say that any Thai restaurant that gives me my choice of "levels of spicyness" already has won my heart!  They offer 1-5, I ordered 5 and it was mouthwatering!  I got the drunken noodles with shrimp (my staple thai dish) and it did not disappoint. Yes, my sinuses were runny, but I like Thai experiences that do that to me so ALL GOOD!!

For a great reasonably-priced hotel very centrally located in Scottsdale, Hyatt place ROCKED!  I stayed here for work during the week since I have a certain budget to stick to and was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful the staff and experience was!  They have a small cardio room for a gym but offer a full, LA Fitness gym access if you show your room key (highly recommend). The staff is so so helpful...they go out of their way to show you around, make you feel comfortable and it even includes a yummy free continental breakfast.  Can't go wrong!

So I brought my Mom here for a belated Mother's day spa weekend. Beautiful grounds but we had to move rooms twice due to the noise level. We picked Firesky thinking it would be a non-daytime party resort but we were wrong. Although there are families there, they still blast music by the pool and it was super hard to sleep in...seriously, do you really have to blast pool music before 8 am on a freaking Saturday???  Get a grip, Firesky.  Also, I paid more to upgrade to a nicer room/view and they charge extra for that so be aware.  They did end up refunded this portion of my stay since we had so much trouble with noise. Oh and the maid also came in when we were trying to take an afternoon nap when we SPECIFICALLY asked them to not disturb until a certain time.  I will say we both LOVED our massages.  The spa knows what they are doing for sure. I highly recommend the vodkatini scrub + massage...heaven!

Why isn't this BH chain in Atlanta?? Good God, this place is yummy (and I know good cupcakes, trust me!).  I got red velvet b/c its my standard to judge a cupcake shop by and it was heavenly!

Since I travel a ton, giving a 5 star rating is bit of a big deal for me.  Vdara did not fail on any level and far exceeded expectations.  I was here for one night on Christmas with my parents we had a great experience from beginning to end.  The rooms are beyond spacious (see my posted pictures).  We had a king bed + sofa bed.  The views were spectacular of the Strip.  The bathroom was enormous and the kitchenette upon walk in was also spacious enough for a short stay.  All amenities were ultra modern.    Housekeeping came up within 15 minutes of the request that was made for shower caps (FYI, they don't have these in the bathroom so you have to request it). I asked for complimentary water and she came back with 5 of them instead of just one...nice touch.  Valet was a bit busy but I am blaming it on the holiday and it took about 15-20 minutes to retrieve our car.    Overall, a super clean, on-point service with modern touches type of hotel.  Exactly what I expect from each hotel experience but rarely get consistently. Bravo Vdara! I will definitely recommend away...

OK listen, I get it...you are in a swank hotel, you have a trendy ambiance but your food is just "OK" at best and your service a bit pretentious...get over yourself!  This is the second time I have dined at Lemongrass (previously lunch) and now dinner...both times, same exact experience.  The staff has serious attitude over God knows what.  Vegas is a tourist destination at the end of the day and service should be front and center every time, for every customer. Lemongrass is kidding itself if they think otherwise.  The food is just average...Thai food is usually good at most places...this is your typical fancy Thai spot that just misses the mark.  The spring rolls are average, the cucumber salad...meh.  The penang curry w/shrimp had a slight kick so was the best thing we ate since it actually had decent flavor. The pad thai was just plain boring.  Wine selection is average...nothing crazy but then again, at a Thai restaurant, can't come in expecting spectacular vino selection.  Please do yourself a favor and skip the nonsense...find a hole in the wall Thai resto off the strip and satisfy your belly and your experience.  Again, the snooty service is the biggest turn off here.

Two words:  Vodkatini scrub...just get it.  They scrub you down with this amazingly wonderful mix of watermelon, basil and vodka (yes, vodka) and then you rinse and they give you a massage of you choice...I did the 80 minute.  Highly recommend and the woman in front (Ina, I think) is very sweet and knowledgeable.

Booked via Expedia because I got a ridiculously cheap rate ($37 for 2 days).  The check in process was BRUTAL.  I would understand if there was a crazy line but there was ONE person in front of me.  They take their damn time and didn't have anyone come out to help (there were other employees just hanging out doing absolutely nothing).  Then when I finally got up to my turn (which took 15 minutes!) the guy was super rude just because I turned down insurance. I see why its cheap.  I guess that's to be expected when rates are this low. I would never recommend this company to any one. Go with SixT for good rates and better service.

Came here for drinks before dinner since I heard about the Flamenco show...sit at the bar, order appetizers and just watch the performance (Fri and Sat 7-9 pm). Such a fun spot and I wish we stayed longer but we had dinner reservations elsewhere that I wanted to check out.  Spain in Scottsdale experience all the way!!!

Had a work dinner in the private dinner room.   Beautiful space (although placement of TV's made it awkward to see the presentation a bit).  Food was phenomenal, I had the sole.  Bathrooms are super trendy and cool (just in case you one of those that care...I am!)  Service on point.  Great experience all the way.

Overpriced clothing but I still love looking around in here.  If things were not so ridiculously expensive for basic things, I would shop here more often.  Great taste in clothing!

Delish brunch spot!!  They take mexican brunch dishes and add a special touch. For instance, they have these amazing fries that they melt cheese on and add corn to...nice touch!  Eggs were yummy.  Love love love this spot for brunch and when I walked by at dinner time it was totally happening so I assume that is good too!

Delicious, authentic SOUTH Indian food.  Had a great experience here with food.  They know how to do dosas right!  Service was sub-par but to be expected in a casual Indian restaurant, I suppose.  They took 20 minutes for my tea (I think they forgot) and when I tried to cancel it, they said its coming momentarily and it still took another 10 minutes...seriously, its just tea...are you going to India and picking the tea leaves itself?!  Sheesh.
