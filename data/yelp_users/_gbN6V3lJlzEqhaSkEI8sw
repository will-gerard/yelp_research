Well, my experience was different than anything I read here! In fact, I'm surprised to see any low star reviews at all.   I was cutting through drywall when I accidentally nicked a copper water line. Water was spraying everywhere! So I grabbed some duct tape (obviously) and shut the water lines off. I called the first company that pulled up when I googled "emergency plumbing" and within 20 min Isaac was at my house fixing my water line. It took all of 10 min tops for him to fix the leak. I thought the rate was completely fair for emergency services and an hour later I sit here with a bag of popcorn and a movie to decompress from that stressful situation that was handled quickly and efficiently by Scottsdale Plumbing. I will definitely use them again in the future. With my propensity to whack a hammer with my eyes closed, I'm sure I'll need them.

First, I would like to start by saying that I LOVE this hotel. Yep... that's right. I LOVE this hotel. I live down the street, and I frequent this hotel, the pool, and the bar at least once or twice a month during the summer. I also visit the VH Spa at least a few times a year as well, and I am frequently treating my mother/sister/friends to Spa days here for a treat/gift.  So, why the 2 star review? I had a really poor experience this last weekend, and I am utterly disappointed at how management responded. Here is the situation:  As I mentioned, I bring people to the Spa here quite often. I am a Maid-of-Honor in an upcoming wedding, and as a part of the low-key "Bachelorette Weekend" I booked Spa services for all the bridesmaids and the bride. This was ~$700 for the services. We also were spending time out at the pool, ordering a few drinks here and there. ~$300 is probably around what we collectively spent at the pool bar.   We had about an hour and a half to kill before our spa services, so we went to the pool to catch some rays. About 15 minutes before our services, we gathered our items, left our bar tab open and went to head upstairs for our treatments. On the way there is where we had our issue.   **TO BE CLEAR, there were 5 of us girls. As we grabbed our items to head straight to the spa, 3 of the girls put all their clothes back on over their wet swimsuits, and myself and another girl just put our shorts/skirt back on and were carrying our tops. Myself and the other girl had not seen any signs requesting that shirts be worn at all times in the lobby or else we would have absolutely covered to their request. We were 100% in the wrong here, we just weren't aware of it at this time. We were in no way trying to break any rules or ruffle any feathers. We were simply walking from the pool door to the stairs straight through.   As we approached the stairs, we were walking past the concierge desk when a lady with short spiky blonde/white/gray (not sure) hair scolded us. She was incredibly rude in her approach to ask us to put our shirts on. When we said "Sorry, we didn't realize..." she interrupted and said "There is a sign that says it RIGHT outside"..... Okay........ It was clear we didn't SEE the sign, and had we seen it, we would have covered up. We really didn't appreciate being scolded like children. Perhaps the sign needs to be in a more visible place? There are lots of signs around announcing a wedding, perhaps when we were walking in, we assumed the sign by the door was another announcement sign like the one by the pool area? Regardless, we all felt her approach was unnecessarily rude and unacceptable to the situation.   So we went upstairs and had our services. Jennifer was my masseuse and she was AMAZING. The girls at the spa desk were very helpful and kind as well. Unfortunately, during my treatments, I found it hard to relax because I was very upset and perturbed by the way we were treated.   After our services concluded and we headed back down to the pool (fully covered), I went to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager. The gentleman at the front desk said he was a manager. When I explained to him that I felt the way I was approached in the situation was unacceptable, he basically reiterated the "Well, there is a sign posted..." line and made no effort in finding a balance with me. I kindly and calmly stated back, "I understand NOW that there is a sign posted. I still have not seen this sign, but I understand that its there, and I recognize that I am in the wrong. I am not denying in anyway that I was in the wrong... but there is a right way and a wrong way to approach a customer, and she chose a very rude, abrasive, and confrontational way of approaching the situation. And THAT is my issue." To that he said "So maybe she needs to soften her approach, and that is a conversation we will have to have with her." He did not say this is any comforting manner. Just simply stated that perhaps a conversation with her is in order. No apology for her behavior, nothing.   I left that conversation feeling about exactly the same as when I started it. Like I never want to return to this hotel. Incredibly bummed at the lack of care and service for the people who frequent their Spa, pool, and bar. Incredibly bummed at their tactless behavior in approaching a customer. To be honest, embarrassed at the way we were verbally and loudly (enough for people around us to hear) attacked by the concierge woman.   There are plenty of other pools/spas/bars in Old Town Scottsdale that I can frequent. I have always CHOSEN to frequent this one. I have CHOSEN to utilize their Spa and bring family and friends. I have CHOSEN to use their pool (and purchase food and drinks) in their "down season" when there is not many people around. I am not someone who comes once a year. I am here year round. I will no longer CHOOSE the Valley Ho. And that is why they are receiving a 2 star review.

I have now been here twice and both times the service and food have been amazing. I made a reservation for 5 girls for a "Bachelorette Brunch" on Sunday morning.   When I realized we were running about 15 minutes late, I called to let them know. The gentleman on the phone assured me not to worry and said, "Don't rush, we don't want you to get pulled over or in an accident, just take your time and we will see you when you get here."  How refreshing! He didn't sound annoyed at ALL, and in fact sounded incredibly chipper!   The iron skillet pancake is drool worthy. The Benedict is also just as delicious.

We found Short Leash Dogs about.... 7? years ago? We stumbled across their food truck in Downtown Phx. What a find!!! We love their food. Its creative and delicious.   Do yourself a favor... don't make any substitutions. Order it how the chef prepares it, even if you aren't sure. You may be surprised!   They also have a location at the Biltmore, if you are in the area, be sure to stop in their for lunch!

I planned a "Bachelortte Dinner" here and unfortunately they only take reservations for 8+ so I wasn't able to make a reservation. We arrived early, however, as expected there was a wait. The wait took longer than we had anticipated, which wouldn't have been an issue but we had a surprise party starting at 7pm sharp somewhere else.   I let the hostess and server know and they made every effort to expedite our meal to get us out on time. I very much appreciated their efforts. They didn't have to hurry or help us out, but they did anyway. The food was delicious (as always) and the wine recommendation was great!

...... Sorry, let me pick my drooling jaw up off the floor.   This place is AMAZING. I usually get two enchiladas with 50/50 tortilla (YUM) and short rib for filling. The short rib is so smoky and delicious. I LOVE that they fire it up in open flame. I can't get enough of the slaw and pickled red onions either. Such a perfect balance to the savory/smoky meat. I will occasionally switch it up with a taco which is equally delicious.   Do yourself a favor and grab some enchiladas from Gadzooks for dinner tonight!

Wow, this place is AMAZING. The lamb chops were some of the best I have ever had. The service second to none. We brought our staff members here as a "thank you" celebration for hitting a milestone and everyone had an amazing dinner.

Phoenix Public Market is excellent!   The food (from breakfast all the way to dinner) is great quality and cooked with love. The rotisserie chicken is cooked to perfection, and amazingly juicy.   One of my (I know I am a werido) favorite things about this place is that they have sparkling water ON TAP. LOOOOVVE this.   The cinnamon roll.... to die for.   The farmers market on Saturdays is so cool too.   Do yourself a favor. Check out this gem in Downtown Phoenix!

Wow! What can I say?! Today, we had Yaya's out to provide food for an event we were having. They showed up on time and despite a few minor hiccups (not on their behalf - someone hit their truck) they still provided great service and beyond delicious tacos! Highly recommend!

Well, first I'll start by saying that I love Fractured Prune. My husband and I have been traveling down to Chandler for the last ~year or so to get their personalized donuts. I like to call it, "Do your own 'nut"  I have been to this Tempe location twice now. The first time was fine, no complaints.   Tonight, however... was a major disappointment. Now, I hate to admit that we were in fact "those" people tonight who showed up 10 minutes before close. We typically don't leave our place of business until around 9pm, so tonight we grabbed a quick dinner and afterward, we had a hunkering for a delicious doYOURownNut. So we made our way over, and licked our chops the whole way. I checked yelp for their hours of operation and we had just enough time to squeeze in. We don't make a habit of walking into businesses right before close, but sometimes it just happens.   As we drove past to park when we arrived, we noticed that every single chair had been placed on top of the tables. We got a bit nervous, but their yelp page listed 10pm so we figured they were cranking out their closing duties early. We parked and walked up to the door. YES! The door also listed 10pm as closing time. We made it! Annnnd then we tried the door. Locked.  No one in sight. So my husband knocked on the door, and one of the employees walked from one side of the store to the other (going into the back room), acknowledging we were there, and completely ignoring us. This didn't sit well with my husband, so he knocked again. Nothing. As we were walking away, another employee came out from the back room and gave us the universally recognized throat slash "closed" symbol. So my husband knocked again because he wanted some kind of explanation. The young guy opened the "after hours" window and said "We are closed."   My husband pointed at the sign and said, "You don't close for another 10 minutes." To which the guy responded in a causal, couldn't care less tone with "We hadn't had a customer in 45 minutes so my manager told me to close. It cost more to keep the doors open than we were making."  I get it. It costs money to do business. But you HAD business standing right in front of you that you weren't willing to service. From my observation in what had appeared to be completed already (chairs up, nozzles removed from soda machine, etc), they had begun closing down at least 20-30 minutes prior to us arriving. Perhaps one of the reasons you had no customers is because people question your reliability in being open after 9pm on a Friday night?   If you don't want to be open until 10pm, I suggest changing your hours. Or hiring employees that take your hours of operation more seriously. Until then, you have two disappointed customers that will likely just choose to get froyo rather than chancing it with you after 9pm.
