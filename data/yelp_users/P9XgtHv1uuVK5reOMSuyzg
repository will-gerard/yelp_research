Cherry is wonderful for many reasons. They have a wonderful diverse selection of things one can order. The issue every time I come here is that I can't decide on what I want! Everything is truly very good, I love the sushi and the ramen especially! The place is very affordable as well. The staff is friendly for the most part but they do get quite busy. When it's busy sometimes the server won't check on the table for a significant amount of time. Food-wise this place is a must but they should strive to have better service.

I had never been here before and had heard wonderful things about it!! I was excited to try it as my friend had her birthday dinner that night.  There was 18 of us, quite a large group but the staff was initially very accommodating. We sat outside and basically had the back patio all to ourselves. It was beautiful! The ambiance was nice but everything else was downhill.  We sat down and no menus were presented which was odd and there were only two drink menus which had to be passed around.  We were informed after ordering our food that the kitchen was backed up. We patiently waited for an ONE HOUR AND A HALF before getting our food.   No manager came around to apologize during the whole time we were there. Instead we were asked time and time again if we wanted to order more drinks.  Our waiter Ashley was nice and kept having servers assistants come over to refill our drinks and nan bread but wasn't wonderful or anything.  I told the hostesses we had a birthday celebration and asked if they could do something nice.  They then sent Ashley over to confirm we had a birthday, ruining the surprise.  The food was okay but nothing spectacular. I was honestly disappointed.  I will not be back and will instead go somewhere else for Persian food. The service was average as well as the food. Nothing special.

I wrote a not so nice review about my first experience here and was invited back, kindly, by the GM Carlos.  He informed me he wouldn't be working the night I would be coming back but set up a reservation anyways for me and my mother.  The staff was so nice and accommodating, they kept checking on me and my mom the entire time we were there.  We ordered a lovely eggplant hummus which was wonderful. Then, we got a huge entree to split between the two of us. I don't remember what it was called but I have a picture to add later on. It was FANTASTIC. The meat was tender and fresh.  Much to my surprise, Carlos showed up! He said he just wanted to stop by and see how things were. Such a kind gesture, such great customer service. It showed he really did care.  The server was genuine and kind, brought us out dessert and then let us know everything was taken care of. When we asked to leave gratuity she charged the card 10 cents and then gave us a quarter back. So nice!  I've been thoroughly impressed and can't wait to visit Persian Room again. I'm glad the manager Carlos invited me back, and I can definitely say I'll be back many times.

This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the whole world! Their food is authentic, good quality as well as delicious!  They have very good customer service. The servers are friendly, attentive and consistent.  Their margaritas are amazing for drinks. Everything that they offer is good. I've never tried something here that I didn't like.  It's amazing food for an inexpensive price. It's a place that will leave your taste buds happy.

Great service and even greater food! They were very accommodating in regards to splitting plates between two people and having a high knowledge of the ingredients in their plates. I would definitely recommend this place to those who have never been before.

One of my fave places to go for a great meal and a cool vibe. The only reason why I'm not giving them five stars is that sometimes the pastys can be a little small, but taste-wise they always deliver! Great place for families, college students, anybody really! Service is always good as well. I recommend this spot for anyone who hasn't been. It's truly a place everybody should try!

Best Korean food in the Phoenix area! They are a little pricey but you get what you pay for. The meat is good quality and always thoroughly cooked. They give you sides and also have great service. I love coming here because they are always consistent with their product. The daeji bulgogi is to die for, I highly recommend it if you've never tried Korean before and have them cook it for you! It's amazing!

This is my favorite Korean restaurant in Phoenix!  I always get their lunch box special because it's inexpensive but incredibly good quality. I come here at least once every two weeks!  Their Daeji Bulgogi is so delicious and every time that I eat it my taste buds become very happy. It is their best dish that they offer.  Their sushi as well is exquisitely made. It's also very good. It's never dry, always fresh. I feel their sushi is such high quality that it could compete with or even beat places like Stingray Sushi.  They also just remodeled their restaurant to have a sushi bar along with karaoke rooms!  This is simply the best Korean restaurant around. They're consistent with service and quality. Never once has food ever been delivered that was less than perfect.  They also do to-go orders which can be a quick fix for people on the move!  Overall, I would give this place 5/5 stars. If you're looking for something new that is the next big thing, then come here! You will not be disappointed!

I've been coming here for the past 4 years.  The people that work here are very friendly and thorough. I've never gotten a bad pedicure or manicure here.  They have an assortment of colors and designs that you can mix and match.  Something that differentiates this place from others in the area is that the employees do not pressure you to upgrade your package.  They give good consistent service every visit and have never disappointed me.  I always get my money's worth here, no matter what.  I would highly recommend coming here if you're looking for a new place to get amazing nail service.

I made a last minute appointment about a month ago and was excited to see results. However, when I arrived nobody greeted me and I was just asked my appointment time and what service I was getting. My hairstylist, whose name I don't remember, was less than friendly. She cut my hair and recommended I get a toner and charged me extra for it. In the end I left unsatisfied. Will not go back.

Staff is friendly for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Even when they're busy there is good service which is what you get when you eat at a five diamond property with a four star star restaurant. They change their menu enough to keep a frequent guest interested. I truly think the mussels and beef tenderloin are absolutely a must have for dinner! Brian, one of the managers, will always take great care of you if you have any concerns or needs. It's definitely a place worth trying, so try it!!!!

You know a place has made it when it's a little business on a corner and they have amazing reviews! I was skeptical at first but it ended up being great! The ladies who made the hot dogs were kind and sure knew how to make great hot dogs! I wasn't disappointed and I will definitely be back!

Today was my first time to Shampoo Ink and I had a wonderful experience! Carley colored my hair a caramel ombré and I am obsessed with it! I've had a couple color treatments done to my hair, but I have never been as satisfied as I am right now.   When I called to make an appointment the person on the phone was friendly and happy to help. Also, I  the day of but they were able to squeeze me in.  Carley was not only friendly and professional throughout our whole session but highly skilled. I told her I wanted ombré but for it to look a little more natural so she blended balayge and ombré together to give me a perfect look! My hair is black and she made sure it looked naturally blended and colored so it didn't look artificial or too done.   I also asked her if she recommended cutting my hair and she told me it was perfectly okay to not do it because I recently had gotten one. Most hairstylists would say yes for the money and she was genuine and honest. She also did a blow out on my hair after the coloring session despite not cutting my hair and didn't charge me extra for it.  Also, the pricing was reasonable for as much as she did and considering how pleased I am with the end result!   I am so happy with my experience at Shampoo Ink, I will always come back! I highly recommend Carley for color or cut!

I have come here on several occasions, one of which was with my extended family. Relish Burger Bistro staff was more than accommodating and gave us our own little room so we could have privacy. They were timely in regards to drinks and food and even considerately split burgers in half for those who were splitting. Their burgers are all amazing, as well as their sliders and fried pickles. The Phoenician Iced Tea is amazing as well! Another time for my dad's birthday I asked them do something special for him and they came out with a pizookie and on the plate had written happy birthday with my dad's name on it. The personal touches and service they provide truly goes above and beyond at this place. I highly recommend this restaurant for any sort of occasion. You can do drinks here, since they do have many tvs or also ask for something more private and sit on the patio overlooking the golf course even. Five stars!

Deana is wonderful!! I found her off of Yelp and she didn't disappoint! I told her I wanted to go darker but still have some definition in my hair with another color. She definitely did a wonderful job. She was meticulous with cutting my hair and with doing the color as well. She mixed up three different colors but it blends so well you cannot even tell! I'm so happy with what Deana did. She's professional, poised and knows what she's doing. I 100% recommend her!

This is the most amazing dessert place in Phoenix. They have the best snow in all of Arizona!   The mix of ice cream and shaved ice is to die for. The flavors that they carry, along with the toppings and drizzle flavors are all so good.  If you come here you won't regret it, it's much better than any Coldstone or Dairy Queen.  Just be open minded and give Snoh a try !!

Went there with my boyfriend and didn't know what to expect since I've heard mixed reviews. We got there at 8:30 and their reverse happy hour was during that time. We ordered crab puffs, 2 Vegas rolls and 2 crunchy California rolls and also got miso soup. It was high quality sushi and I was more than satisfied. All together our total came to 26 dollars or so which is not bad at all, taking into consideration how sushi can be expensive. I will definitely be returning!

I went to Snooze with a couple of my friends yesterday and I was blown away with how amazing their food and service was.  I had the "OMG French Toast" and it was delicious! The syrup they had was scrumptious and it was the best French toast I have ever had! It was very sweet.  One of my friends had three different types of pancakes and the sweet potato pancakes were to die for. All of the pancakes were good that she had but that was the highlight.  I also got hash browns and eggs on the side. The eggs were okay and the hashbrown was delicious! I was not disappointed with it at all.  So I give snooze 5/5 stars! It's definitely something to try and enjoy!

If you do not want food poisoning, then do not eat here. The person I was with had to call out of work at 2 AM due to vomiting for a half hour straight from take out. I will never order from this place ever again. Save yourself the money, sleep and hopefully your stomach.

I come here at least twice a week because I live next door and because the sushi is such high quality. Literally, the sushi is some of the best I've ever had. It's not only a relatively inexpensive place to get your grub on but it's also a fun experience. The only reason why I give it four stars is because sometimes the servers aren't attentive. Otherwise, this place is amazing!
