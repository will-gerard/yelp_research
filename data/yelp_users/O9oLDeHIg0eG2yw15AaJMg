Carpet Medic is absolutely AMAZING and their service is SO friendly.  Just when I think it is time to rip out the carpet due to kids and dogs, the come and make it look brand new again.  They have gotten Paint out of our carpet, unknown Red stains, and left no residue of dog messes.  We LOVE them!!!!

It was by accident we ended up here last Saturday night.  It was no accident that we have been back for a total of 3 times in 5 days.    There is nothing better in LA than getting Carne Asada tacos off the Taco Truck.  And FINALLY we found a place who serves them up right just like em, if not better!  Street tacos are supposed to be small so the smaller size was not a surprise to us.  it was LOADED with meat.  They didn't cheapen it at all!    Loved the HOT chips and salsa.  It is soo fresh and full of yum!    The staff is SOOOOO personable.  If anything... the friendliness of this place is worth it.    The ambiance is what drew us in there.  I love the music and atmospere.  We will be back!  Hold the 2 end spots for us!  ;)

I LOVE Rock Taco Cantina!  They are so super friendly!  Last week my husband and I's "spot" at the bar was taken.  It was nice that the workers recognized that and all said something.  Super personable and I love being remembered when I walk in somewhere... in a city so big.    The food is AWESOME!  I am finally venturing out to try something other than their DELICIOUS street tacos!  Their flat bread pizza was Also amazing!  my next visit might be Chicken and Waffles.  EVERYTHING looks so YUMMY on that menu!    Shelly is amazing and knows what we want to drink as soon as she sees us!  I am lost when I go in there and she isn't working!  She is SUPERB!    The owner is always there walking around too, LOVE IT!  I love how they are involved with their customers!    I just might have to celebrate my birthday there this year.  =)

The worst McDonald's ever. They never get the order right. They are slow. And speak horrible English!

Dr.  Warkentin is the most compassionate person I have ever met. Not only in your medical care but also in your life events.    He did awesome things for my son whom was medically fragile.  He took care of him pro bono because he believed in what he was doing episode help him and he knew we were piled with other medical bills.    I can't thank him and the rest of the staff for helping me get on my feet after a car accident.  Everyone in that building and in every division are so kind!     My boys and I love every aspect of Verve Wellness Center!!!!!
