State of the art ball field with a  great variety of concessions and family atmosphere!  Easy parking and access to the park.     If you you are on a budget get the Subway sandwiches or tacos otherwise splurge on the footlongs!   Great way to spend an afternoon.

Booked a room online for the SHOT Show; the price was reasonable but when we checked in we were hit with a $28 a night "resort fee" for things we wouldn't use, like wifi, in room coffee and the gym. Make this a part of your room rate, not an extra fee.   We arrived at about 630pm on a Monday. There is no signage for check in, and we had to hunt down a bellman who held the cart and watched my 55 year old wife load the cart. What?!   We had booked a king room, but only two queen rooms were left. We only got our "in room coffee" replenished twice. They refunded one night of the resort fee only after Carmen at the front desk argued with me that in room coffee was not part of the fee.   The shuttle to the strip only runs from 11a to 8p, and the bellman are utterly uninvolved in helping you get a cab.   The casino is nice, the only saving grace at this hotel. Go elsewhere.

Excellent choice for dogs and brats with a great variety of toppings!   The wife got the OG dog and said it was wonderfully unusual and the pretzel bun was fantastic!   As a Chicago girl she had to it was completely different than a Chicago dog so this Arizona boy wouldn't get Cocky!
