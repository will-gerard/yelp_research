I hadn't heard of Nello's until recently and it is now my favorite restaurant in the valley! Awesome pizza and the house dressing is equally as good. Great service most of the time and I need to try their happy hour soon.

Hands down, my favorite bar in Tempe.   I recently went for happy hour and they had awesome specials on drinks and appetizers. The waitresses are always great there as well.  I tend to go here on the weekends when it is really busy but it's a fun time whenever and it seems to always bring in good people.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a good time.

Sorry, Rula Bula.  You went from being my favorite bar, to one of the worst.  The people that take your money at the front are downright rude.  The guy with the round glasses tried to snatch the money out of my hands before I handed it to him which is NOT okay with me.  The new management is terrible.  Things used to run smoothly but now it seems as though it's always a mess.  One night we had to pay a cover and the bathrooms weren't even working.  REALLY?  There are far too many other places to spend my hard earned money; I'll take my business elsewhere.

Overall, a really good time. Yes, they charge a cover at the door which sucks but you are seeing people play music and entertain. I'd pay $6 any day to watch people do what they love and have a good time.   Drinks are reasonably priced, a little higher than other places but still pretty decent.   The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the lack of seating for everyone. I really liked the atmosphere though so it makes up for it. A basement is definitely the best place for a bar like this.  I recommend going at least once and experiencing it for yourself.

Great food. The atmosphere is a little uncomfortable but the zucchini fries make up for that. I had the BBQ burger and my boyfriend had the bison burger. Both were cooked exceptionally although it took quite a while for the food to be done.   Groupon usually has specials here so I'd definitely give it a shot.

I did not feel welcome and during my eye exam Dr. Quaranta was on FACEBOOK! Not even joking about that, and I am completely disgusted at how unprofessional it is. I did not feel like a patient that he was interested in retaining; I felt rushed in and rushed out. What an uncomfortable experience.

First of all, I know of ZERO offices that use Facebook as a means of internal communication. Honestly,I saw what the message said so I KNOW it wasn't business related. Also, emailing me on my birthday with some sob story about the economy in a sorry attempt for me to change my reviews listed on multiple websites is just beyond unprofessional. I've experienced more professional service at my local Home Depot. Please stop contacting me (calls,emails,texts). I was not a happy client and I will not be returning to your office. I wanted to let others know about my experience because its important to have someone you can trust with your eye doctor. I did not leave with that feeling. I will ask you again nicely, please stop contacting me.

What a lame transition. Disappointed entirely with the decision to switch over to classic rock. Dave Pratt= asshole.

Let me start off by saying that I really like their raspberry chipotle wings. The service, however, is less than par; it's hot and cold with their bartenders. I live relatively close to the bar so I'm in there a few times a month and I always enjoy a cold beer and wings but most of the time we arrive at the bar we are not greeted promptly and when we are it's a "what did you want" kind of attitude. The food/beer alone do not make a bar, it is the service/atmosphere. If they would hire on people that knew how to communicate with customers and not look less than happy to be there, I think this would be a great place.   (I will say that the guy that works there behind the bar and also does some serving is always really nice. The majority of this review is about the girls that are tending the bar.)

I finally reached my last straw with this place. A few weekends ago there was a crowd there that the staff was obviously not happy about sitting at the bar (which is completely normal at ANY bar)! It was midnight.. that means dealing with drunk people. As a business, you are not always going to like your customers or want them to stay there all night, but punishing the customers there that were not apart of that group is downright wrong. Instead of kicking out the trouble makers, they decided to shut the entire bar down early. Sorry, that's just not how you operate a business. Good luck to them trying to run a bar like that.
