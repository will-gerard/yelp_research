Go see Jess for your hair needs.  She listens and knows all the latest techniques.  She is a color expert and I trust her completely.

She did a great job on my full lace wedding dress.  She had great suggestions and after one fitting my dress was perfect!

This place is boring and tries way too hard.  The menu is limited. I had the "pigstrami" sandwich. It was ok, not great. I ordered the side salad but the brought me fries.  They couldn't leave the ketchup alone, it was gross because they tried to make it special.  I will never go back because there are too many other great options in the area.
