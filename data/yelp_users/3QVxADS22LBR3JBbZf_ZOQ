Shout out to the guy on Trip Advisor who said the L'Italiana here is the best pizza in Northern Phoenix...I don't live locally, but this was wonderful advice and was well worth going a few miles out of the way for.  Antipasto salad was good, if not standard.  But man, that pizza.  Really incredible.

Quite simply, some of the most authentic, straight-forward Mexican food I've ever had.  I plan on making it a priority to stop here every time I'm in town from now on.

My family has been staying here every so often when we're in town for Thanksgiving for as long as I can remember.  And we've had nothing less than the absolute best experiences, this year being no exception!  The layout really does make it seem like you're in some kind of tropical oasis, and the staff is always completely and totally friendly and wonderful.  I love this place, and plan on staying here whenever possible in the future!

This place is terrible.    Awful beer selection.  Nice enough (if not braindead) servers.  Nauseating clientele.    Won't be going back.

There's just no possible way to overstate how spectacular Pizzeria Bianco is.  I had the massive good fortune of walking in on a Wednesday night to no line out the door whatsoever, still thanking my lucky stars for that haha.  I started out with a nice cold local IPA and the mozzarella-tomato-basil dish.  And it was extraordinary.  What's really nice is that they let you order half and half pizzas, as there was no way I could decide between the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy.  And I'm so glad I got to try both!  I honestly don't know which I would pick if I had to choose, they were both so unbelievably delicious.    Every positive thing you've heard about Pizzeria Bianco is true.  Simply amazing!

While in Las Vegas for my brother's bachelor party, we were waited on by Byron in the private dining room.  Absolutely, without a doubt, in the top 3 best meals I've ever had in my entire life.  Ever ever.    Course after course of fresh sashimi, with some kobe beef sliders at the end.  Words cannot describe how incredible this meal was, and I have recommended Social House to every friend of mine going to Las Vegas since.  In a town chock full of incredible restaurants, this one really stands alone.

This place is insanely good.  WHY ARE THERE NO CUSTARD BURGER JOINTS IN L.A.???  The original Freddy's special with everything on it and fries hits the spot every single time.    The service here is some of the most energetic and friendly that I've ever come across, too.  I mean, yesterday the owner himself was going around talking to people, making sure they were content.  You don't find that every day.

Someone, from Philadelphia mind you, told me the cheesesteak at Uncle Sam's is better than anything he had ever had in Philly.  It wasn't.  It was incredibly mediocre, dry, and flavorless.  The honey wings were pretty good, but aside from that this place sucks.  Oh hey look, another generic sports bar type place in a strip mall in Arizona.  Pass.

On the way into town, I googled "best sandwich Henderson Nevada" and this was one of the first places that popped up.  The two sandwiches I had were heavenly, and the service was so extremely friendly that, quite frankly, it makes most other places pale in comparison.  I don't live in the area, but I will definitely be returning here again next time I'm in town.

They got the hell part right.  One of the absolute worst places I've ever been.  Would rather stab myself in the eyes with scissors than ever go back.

After trying this place for the first time last year when I was in Phoenix and having a wonderful experience, I went back there today and was absolutely disgusted.  As we approached the front door a friend said he thought it looked closed, but it turned out it was open there just weren't any people inside.    The place smelled like a sewage plant on the inside, and we immediately turned around and went elsewhere for food.  Luckily my friend said a new Ramiros opened near his house, because I will definitely never go back to this location again.

The Sweet & Spicy Burger here is indeed excellent.  The candied jalape√±os it's topped with are perfect.  It's huge and intimidating, best consumed on an extremely empty stomach.  The mesquite charred chicken wings are also delicious, although perhaps not best ordered before a burger unless you're sharing them with someone (I was very full after enjoying both on my own).  But yeah, this is a great little random strip mall find.

Zero stars.  Of all the places in LA to expand it had to be this hellhole.  Awful people, awful atmosphere, and probably the most arrogant bartender I've ever encountered.  And that's really saying something.

Completely and totally delicious (intoxication not necessary, haha!).  Both slices I had were a bit on the salty side (just the way I like it), and man that white pizza especially was just divine.  Quick service, friendly employees, just a really great spot.    Shout out to the girl in the elevator that told me how to get there or else I might have never found it!

While staying at a hotel across the street, I visited this place mainly out of proximity.  Turns out they cook up really, really good BBQ.  The meat was cooked just perfectly, the sausage delicious, and they give you plenty of sauce to take with you when you order take out.    A very easy, quick experience with take out and everyone here was super friendly.

Awful.  Terrible beer selection.  Mildly passable beer selection.  Oddly condescending service.  If your local county fair is the vibe you go for, this place is for you.  Otherwise, go anywhere else but here.
