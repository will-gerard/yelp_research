This loc8ion has made some nice improvements 2 their interior in the last year which make it a more pleasant dining experience (dimmer lighting & earthy toned walls). My light~sensitive eyes used 2 squint, straining against the harsh bright lighting ricocheting off the white walls which used 2 give me a bit of a headache & felt more like being in a hospital cafeteria setting. (Sunglasses indoors r'nt cool). Even b4 these upgrades, I still preferred this central loc8ion over the I-17 North Black Canyon Access Rd 1 in atmosphere & service.      I do enjoy the selections & most items I've tried have looked, smelled, & tasted of fresh ingredients & good 2 the palate. I don't eat much pasta or breads so I can't provide much input in that regard other than the gluten~free coconut muffins which I couldn't get enough of. My dinner companion mentioned their pasta didn't have much flavor, leaving over 1/2 of it 2 b taken away. I always luv their sweet potatoes w/ a li'l brown sugar/cinnamon.       Most Xs their soups r flavorful & deliciously appealing w/ a nice selection 2 choose from (potato/leek a personal fave) & usually their tapioca pudding is perfect w/ the right consistency. My companion really enjoys the foccacia bread(s) & the servers r always very nice & accomod8ing which is not always the case other loc8ions. I'd steer clear of the caramel topping as it tastes like some1 puts salt in it & isn't complimentary in passing 4 what it's supposed 2 b w/ bit of a funky after~taste, but overall this was an enjoyable place 2 go this wk~end (& whenever I'm in Central Phx).

NYPD has Always been a Fave & now they're nearing the very top of our list (as long as they don't do away w/ their Veganizza & Pizza Blanca 4 us Veg~heads) & GLUTEN FREE is a MAJOR + !!! Thank U 4 having/offering these #1Derful options 4 those of us who r'nt carnivores as there wouldn't b much 4 us 2 order 2 patronize ur eatery!!     I'm not a fan of pizza dough but their's is on another scale that I actually eat the crust 2 (which I don't do w/ other pizza). We had/shared between us Spinach salad (sans the bacon), Caprese, Spinach/Artichoke dip, & Zucchini sticks were all Absolutely AHHhmazing as usual but our main reason 4 coming: Veganizza & Pizza Bianca we had r PERFECTION 2 die 4... seriously Exceptional in flavors & texture!!!     On previous visits we've had the Soho salad pizza, greek salads, Eggplant & the Chelsea chopped salad (minus the bacon)... all So Delicious & especially luv the salad pizza concept, pls keep this 2!!      We usually like 2 sit in the outside section because my guilty pleasure is watching any of the birds flitting around the bushes & scavenging 4 crumbs which I someXs 'accidentally' drop in my occasional clumsiness. Also the service has always been impeccable whenever we've gone which is truly appreci8ed & a very integral part of the dining experience!     We luv the cannolis/kisses & we've had the tiramisu in the past which was AWESOME 2 (but not offered on menu anymore)? We have yet 2 try the limoncello cake but will save that in anticip8ion 4 our next visit. NYPD ROCKS & really hope they keep these Veg~head/Gluten~Free faves of ours so we can continue our business w/ this establishment!!!

This is @ least my 3rd time here & really I'm pretty impressed!! Never had bad service or food 4 that matter, but notice a marked improvement each time I visit. We decided 2 visit as the previous day we missed dining here on account of their hours (which I think is pretty ingenious). I'm sure they get a good portion of their business due 2 the fact they close @ 2pm, (unless it's fri open till 8p 4 dinner) so if u snooze u lose! Places like Denny's that r open 24/7 r probably put on the back burner by people that like them because u can go anytime & they'll always b there (except 4 the loc8ions that have shut down).     I remember back in the day this property used 2 b a bar (named Last Call or something 2 that effect) w/ a weird shaped roof 2 look like a sports arena & there were a few Xs when near accidents almost occurred as drunkards leaving there were almost turned in2 speed~bumps staggering across the road right in2 traffic, oblivious 2 any danger. Glad that's long gone & now replaced by a 60's style place that puts 5 & Diner 2 shame & probably had something 2 do w/ the L8 Nifty 50's & Ed Debevic's being out of business as far as Gr8 pricing 4 Better food w/ Generous portions.      1derful classic look decor w/ black & white tiled bar & funny themed signs/collectables throughout. When u come in, make sure u stand a li'l 2 the right (not enough 2 fall in a diner's lap) but enough where u can b seen 2 b seated as their busy tending 2 patrons inside unless u opt 4 grabbing a spot @ the bar top. Their windows have been upgraded 2 the frosted logo/design which helps keep u from cooking while w8ing on ur grub & the bright sun out of ur eyes while staying cooler, Nice!     Service can b w/ a smile or none depending on who u get as ur w8ress but never had bad & would gladly take their worst over what we went thru @ Kiss the Cook!! I also like witnessing other servers helping out other tables w/ refills, clearing pl8es etc which made us wanna tip them 2 (since they were actually friendlier than our w8ress) but hey, she didn't bark @ us or fling our pl8es like frisbees either so I can handle non~smiling (better than being nause8ingly fake/phony if not naturally 'nice').     Gr8 lamin8ed menus w/ breakfast on 1 side/lunch on the other & I dig the novel concept of the booth tables w/ local places advertising their business/services (actually jotted down a few of interest 4 future reference). What was ordered: a Veggie omelette chock full of spinach, tomato, onion, mushroom, broccoli florets topped w/ sliced avocado, hash browns, a crispy on the outside fluffy inside waffle w/ all natural syrup, an AMAZING Banana Muffin (shoulda got 2), texas style toast w/ grape & mixed berry jelly, perfect no lumps grits w/o being soupy, & apple juice. EVERYTHING was DIvine in complimentary flavors, textures, freshness & portion!!     What woulda made this 5*? Bring back your AWESOME Bread Pudding we planned on sharing, that YUMMiness was the *Bomb* & we were disappointed not 2 get slightly tipsy from the bourbon or whatever it was made w/. Perhaps that's why they removed it from the menu/no longer offer it. Can see it now: 'No officer, I haven't had anything 2 drink, I just came from that diner & all I had was some bread pudding!' Tee~hee

So we found ourselves on this part of town when running errands & I really felt like some Garden Stuffed Crepes so decided on a whim 2 visit my fave IHOP loc8ion. I've never gotten bad or even just decent service here & I always get a warm inviting vibe from the interior lighting & decor in warmer pastel hues.        Ok, so part of it may b a li'l nostalgia being I used 2 work in this shopping plaza & across the street back in my GCC days when I lived over here but I find it impressive that they're the ONLY place in this vicinity that's STILL here from even b4 back then when everything else has changed businesses several Xs or been LONG GONE. It was also unusual not 2 have 2 w8/b put on the list as whenever we've been here on wk~ends it's always pretty slammin' but I never mind the w8 as it's worth it.     Have mostly eaten inside w/ the cushy booths but have also ventured out 2 the patio area a few Xs under the misters when it's been nicer weather outside. 2day we were served by w8ress Lindsay who had just come on 4 her shift but didn't know that till she told us l8er as she was the usual on~the~ball type service we've always experienced here.      I was disappointed 2 discover they had removed the Garden Stuffed Crepes from their new menu as it was my favor8 (& a gr8 price) but I guess it did have a good run as I'd been surprised many Xs 2 c it still offered all those previous occasions. So instead I ordered the Spinach Red pepper sandwich on sourdough which came w/ seasoned fries & my companion had the Strawberry Crepes w/ a side of wheat Banana Pancakes (Gr8 w/ their Butter Pecan flavored syrup ~ just another trademark of theirs 2 luv w/ several selections 2 choose in addition 2 Strawberry, Boysenberry & their Original).      All was Delicious as we've come 2 expect from all our previous visits here, but we were both blown away by the PERFECTION of the sandwich!! We ordered this same item @ 19th/Northern & tho it was really good & nice size portion there, this loc8ion just has it down as far as the complimentary blend of quality ingredients surrounded by a perfectly seasoned Toasted Crispy Sourdough on the outside & savory softness w/o being soggy or  greasy on the inside & fries were SUPERb 2 ~ Major props 2 the cook/preparer!! So thx Lindsay 4 ur #1derful,  friendly, attentively accomod8ing & professional service 2day + all the other patrons we saw u taking such good care of! Awesome food, Amazing & quick service @ a Gr8 Price, it's no 1der this will remain our FAVE, the other loc8ions can't hope 2 compete w/ what we experience here! Just really wish they would BRING BACK the GARDEN STUFFED CREPES 4 us Veg~heads ~ that's the ONLY thing I can say that would make it even more PHENOMENAL!!...

Been here thrice b4 (usually w/ the nieces in tow) & each time there's new additions/improvements/expansions which puts the Phoenix Zoo 2 shame (much as I like them). Not only r they massive in scale by comparison, u get 2 c most of the animals (many of them rare) in their enclosures as ur in much closer proximity 2 them. Parents need 2 more closely monitor their kids here as it's easy 2 get past the barriers & curious fingers have gotten pecked @ w/ the inevitable wailing that follows 4 not being tended 2 enough while being busy distracted by watching other animals instead.     Some exhibits, u even get 2 engage w/ such as my favor8 giraffe feeding which I end up spending @ least 1/2 my time in front of. There's also a sting~ray feeding if u wanna shell out a few bucks instead of quarters @ the giraffe dispensers. We started @ the log ride 2 cool off as it was a blisteringly hot day & tho it was a rather short ride it was still scenic & served it's purpose. So we actually spent more $$ @ the beginning (admission, log ride, ray feeding, drinks, popcorn) & less toward the end. I always come expecting 2 pay a bit 4 anything as this is an AMAZING EXPERIENCE Every Time & obviously goes back in2 caring 4 all the 1Derful animals & maintaining this Beautiful zoo.     I skipped the sky~lift ride myself but walked underneath my nieces the whole way who were having a gr8 time taking in the sights of the park from their perspective while hovering above me. The Aquarium & all it offers is a must see & b experienced in it's entirety 4 urself. There's not enough praise I can give Wildlife World Zoo & Aquarium but I'll always luv every opportunity 2 frequent here!!  Keep up UR AMAZING WORK while providing us such an interactively AWESOME Experience w/ so many of these sacred & interesting creatures... so appreci8 this place & is most Defin8ly worth the trip & the long~lasting memories it cre8es!!!  Btw, 1 of my fave moments was when my sister's hubby went 2 take a pic of a gorgeous black jaguar laying on the fencing above his head & he simultaneously got snarled, swatted & hissed @ scaring the dicken's (or piss) out of him. Jumping out of his skin was an underst8ment but guess he also learned a lesson (while we got a laugh @ his expense 4 not considering they wouldn't like something pointed @ them or the noise it made), here's ur sign! ;-)

So I got dragged here because some1 was driving me nuts wanting 2 go c Godzilla & even though I'm kinda used 2 AMC dine~in cinema suites w/ all that leg room in comfy recliners, this turned out 2 b quite an nicer time than originally expected 4 this kind of theater.      Heck, I actually used 2 work in this mall @ a calligraphy/airbrush art cart back in the day when the cinema was inside the Christown mall upstairs via the escal8or, then they moved it 2 19th ave which was a defin8 downgrade, but much 2 my surprise I'm pretty sure this is probably the nicest Harkins theater I've seen/been 2 which says a lot.      Recommend going w/ a large popcorn & drink as it entitles u 2 a free refill. Concession stands r actually pretty painless & fast moving as they have plenty of employees tending 2 patrons so we still snagged decent seats even tho it was packed as I'd expect 4 a new film especially being the wk~end.     Every single employee we encountered were friendly, helpful & cheerful from purchasing our tickets, the ticket taker, 2 trips 2 the concessions & especially the guy who was w8ing 4 the theater 2 clear so he could clean up after the lazy pigs who can't exert themselves 2 simply throw their own trash away as they walk past 2 receptacles on their way out.      Wish I got ur name thin, young employee guy outside of theater #5 of the 3:10p showing of Godzilla on Sun 05/18/14~ while w8ing 4 my companion 2 reappear from the restrooms, I heard/observed u wishing every1 a gr8 day, hoping they enjoyed themselves (even the rude (_y_) a$ses) & ur interaction was the nicest genuine employee 2 seal the positive experience 4 our departure b4 u having 2 clean up horrors I can only imagine worse than what I saw left behind inside. What a WINNING attitude!!     It was also nice 2 c a security guard golf driving around the parking lot as we had 2 park a decent distance away (it helps provide a little peace of mind that some1's looking out while vehicles r unattended etc.)  An added + it's also nice not 2 have 2 go thru the mall 2 get 2 the entrance. So yeah I'll defin8ly return 2 this 1derful place which not only far exceeded my expect8ions, but made me regret it took this long 2 c what I'd been missing...

UGGGHH ~ DON'T do it!!! I really wanted 2 like this place but it's not a 'Gr8' anything except @ giving violent lengthy sessions praying 2 the porcelain gods as a result of giving them a try (a gamble I was pretty quickly sorry 4 having taken if it weren't 4 my lunch companion's insistence).     I wasn't expecting much & everything I tried seemed 2 b @ the right temp & most items ranged from decent-good tasting, but 15 min8es in I fell ill w/ severe pain & loud thunderous disapproval stemming from my extremely unhappy stomach. Not sure exactly what the culprit(s) were, but I noticed the lo mein noodles were far greasier than they looked present8ion~wise b4 being on my pl8. I also had some green beans & mixed veggie dishes in addition 2 some EFY, couple bites of an imit8ion crab looking casserole, & a couple Crab Puffs w/ the red sweet n sour sauce. Whatever disagreed w/ me certainly gave me a 'sour' stomach & such painful forceful heaving that I thought I'd literally c my guts coming up any moment as I felt pretty much turned inside~out.     I wasn't intending 2 visit their restrooms as I have a gr8 disdain 4 public 1s (which turned out 2 b a 'case~in~point' why) but it was either that, or lose it all @ the table. If u need 2 throw up, the condition of the bathrooms or even on ur way 2 them will easily push u over the edge (not that I needed it as I barely got there w/o cre8ing a spectacle as it was). Funky rancid stench & stepped on fortune cookies etc carelessly left in ur path on ur way there as u pass kitchen/janitorial workers who r 2 busy hanging around the soda fountain thinking it's a QT.    Do urself, ur body & health a favor of skipping this place. I've never been so sorry as I was yesterday 2 give the benefit of the doubt 2 an establishment  by unknowingly risking myself in the process. I guess it coulda been worse = by spending full amount instead of the discounted price (thx 2 a coupon) 2 get an instant case of food poisoning. I wouldn't wish this on any1 & this has got 2 b the most Excruci8ing bout I've ever encountered ~ & I've experienced a couple b4!! Service was ok, interior outd8ed & in desper8 need of an upgrade (esp the latrines which were equivalent 2 rest~stop bathrooms @ best)!!     Well, can't say I didn't give them a shot but take heed, ur better off not giving them the same chance I gave 2 prove I shoulda been more cautious about the neg8ives st8ed in previous reviews....... This is a case of shoulda stuck w/ my 'gut' so I could keep mine, instead of being talked in2 something against my better judgement..... ;-(

Put a bunch of antiques/vintage collectibles/rummage/pawn/yard/est8 sales 2gether all in 1 place & what~dya~got? The Brass Armadillo!! It's a consignment style warehouse turned massive 'hoarder paradise' (but in a good way & much nicer setting). U never know what treasures u'll find & yes I'm guilty of tagging along w/ some1 wanting 2 go, then leaving w/ unexpected purchases on a few different occasions. Hey, someXs it just can't b helped!      Columns of endless glass display cases from the entrance-middle of store on the right section can feel a bit overwhelming, if not disorienting (like a rat in a maze) or u might get the sens8ion of being in a casino w/ stimulus overload but maybe that works 2 their advantage when u end up zoning~out & find urself being checked out @ the front registers.      This treasure trove of eclectic-the eccentric/common-rare/retro-avant garde modern, has more than u could expect 2 find from grandma's jewelry, grandpa's old military trunk, brother's rather extensive vintage Playboy collection, mom's favorite artist prints, dad's various tinkering tools, sister's vinyl records, cousin's figurine collection & all of their closets, office, attics &/or garages combined... well, u get the idea (& if not): Furniture, knick~knacks, clothing, accessories, collectibles, books, home decor, instruments etc etc etc. Aspiring Antiques Roadshow dreamers, here's ur place!     I can't select a pricing scale as it depends on the item(s) & perhaps it really boils down 2 how much u want/need/luv it. Just know it seems u can both Lose or Find urself while within these walls! (Alice in 1derland any1)? Or how about a serious scavenger hunt held here? Now, that would b an Amazing Challenge!!     If ur currenty a 'hoarder', u'll most certainly suffer a pretty permanent re~lapse so b 4warned if u know any who defines that word! I just know 4 the sake of my pocketbook, many Xs I have 2 steer clear of this place cuz it offers 2 much 2 b passed up on & I can't afford 2 'window~shop' here! It's ur trip down Nostalgia or Amnesia Lane & not quite sure if I feel older or younger when leaving! Tee~hee ;-)

It's not an eat~in or drive~thru place, but u can pick~up ur order(s) & of course the Delivery they're known 4. Must admit, MANY years ago we also were 1 of those who placed an online order & went 2 pick it up, only 2 b told there was no order but... they r a Drastically Improved & a Completely Reliable place now!     It makes all the difference when u hire actual 'WORKers' or perhaps it was a combin8ion of such + internet issues on their end BACK Then, being the place was fairly new. Whatever the case WAS, it's like a completely new/different place now that's back in our good graces, having earned back our business (which btw is no small feat/nearly impossible once having lost it) which in & of itself speaks volumes!!     Tend 2 do more Pick~Up than Delivery these days but either way, the front counter & behind the scenes staff & drivers have been courteous, prompt & always have our orders Correct, hot, & freshly made (can always tell). We've been REALLY impressed on more than a few occasions where it defin8ly went beyond the usual Amazing service we have been accustomed 2/come 2 expect.      Their rewards program is an Awesome concept where u gain points every time u purchase (think it's 1 point for every $5 spent) & once u accumul8 25 u get a FREE Large pizza w/ up to 3 toppings, so how kewl is that? Our fave is the Spinach Alfredo Specialty Pizza & they've just come out w/ a new Greek Pizza that we're gonna have 2 try (which we'd customize w/o meats). Pretty Good desserts 2!     Over the passing years we've used them countless Xs & they will continue 2 get our business whenever we need a quick~fix, haven't made it 2 the grocery store/don't feel like cooking when I/they get home from work, or just in the mood (as was the case just lastnight in fact) Hee~hee! Keep up the gr8 work PJ's, U've come a Long Way which Really Shows & it's Gr8ly Appreci8ed...

Stopped here 2day w/ a dear gf of mine 4 a nice lunch while we caught up 4 a couple hrs. She'd never been here & it had been awhile 4 me even though I'd previously dined a handful of Xs. I luv the family owned oper8ions & this 1 has been here 4 @ least 20+ yrs that I know of.     This small li'l hole in the wall is pretty much the Best place in the whole shopping plaza & as far as Greek goes, it's been a fave tho I have not had 2 many other Greek experiences 2 make comparisons (hey, get ur mind outta the gutter~talkin' bout food)! The decor is nicely themed 4 it's size & have 2 admit I kinda like hearing hollering of orders & family rel8ed antics (it's kinda like getting free entertainment while ur w8ing) which I feel is part of what makes it the cultural experience 2.     We started w/ the greek salad complete w/ the authentic kalamata olives (careful of the pitts) & special made house dressing, mine sans the feta cheese. We shared some hummus & an order of spanikopitas. I also tried a side of their lentil soup & we already had our heart set on some baklava 4 dessert but un4tun8ly they were out. (or none was made, or in the process there~of). I know it takes awhile 2 make but dang, baklava goes in~hand w/ Greek excursions!     Salad was good, lentil soup was very good as was the hummus (perfect consistency tho needing a li'l spice/flavor) ALL generous portions 4 the $$ but both of us agreed the flaky crispily scrumptuos Spanikopitas = AHhhmazing & made it worth our visit in itself!!!  In fact, when we come back we may just order those & of course the baklava we missed out on... that's IF they have it (& why it's 4 instead of 5* rating).     Also,  the service is good & efficient, just don't expect kissy~face kindness (also part of what I refer 2 as part of the authentico experience). Besides I find it more unnerving/nause8ing when some1 attempts portraying/sounding like a real sweetheart but is always blatantly obvious when it's an Act. B prepared 2 b given an uncomfortable once over (looking u over up & down). Felt like being sized up if worthy enough 2 b seated, but guess we were (or our $ was good enough 2 take).     A poor lady stood there w8ing 2 b seen 4 about 10 min while our server was sitting down right across the way from her reading something. I felt bad 4 her (even while engrossed in girly's convers8ion) & almost wanted 2 say some1 would b w/ her so she'd notice her, but feared a lazer~eyed glare my direction turning me 2 stone. Maybe I could b a statue 2 greet patrons @ the entrance. Yikes! Just kidding, or am I?      She finally got seated only After a party was leaving ready 2 pay.  Another reason not Perfect 5* but I'll enjoy coming here 'once in awhile' calling b4 hand or ask prior 2 bn seated 2 c if baklava is available whenever the next while happens. Overall a Gr8 li'l place!!

Wow, tough crowd of reviewers 4 this place which I don't understand as all my experiences here have always been 1derful whether Dine~in, drive~up window (yes' they have 1 4 pick~up orders) or Delivery!      I've been going 2 this place since a dear friend of mine introduced me 2 their lunch special back in my art~school days. (LONG time ago) I remember being surprised by the unique option of zucchini 4 a topping & it's still an absolute fave 4 me 2 this day! Hope they don't remove it from their menu as I'd certainly miss it.      My most recent visit was dining in the restaurant w/ a dear girlfriend early evening & we were catered 2 by a young man who gave several options 2 customize our pie according 2 my dietary restrictions. We started w/ their Artichoke Spinach dip & Bruschetta ~ Both were AHhmazing & the Gorgonzola Pear Salad was Delectable w/ it's candied walnuts, cranberries, pears, gorgonzola cheese & sweet pear dressing on spring mix greens. MMMmm!     So we both ordered a large pie w/ the intention of bringing home the rest 2 our households... well, guess it's rather self~explanatory that not very much was left & we were restraining ourselves as it was, Oops... kinda. Tee~hee! Not even much crust was left from the slices we 8 & I 'ususally' don't eat that,.. but theirs is good!     She had a Mediterranean which she Luved & they made me a KILLER Gluten~Free White Pizza w/ Zucchini & Alfredo sauce instead of tomato. I've also had their Vegetarian's Delight Cold Sub, Eggplant Rollatini Pasta, Classic Margherita Pizza & Pesto Veggie & Cheese Pizza which r all personal favor8s. I can also attest 2 the Baked Ziti, Cheese Ravioli & their Greek salad being pretty great when I've been in the mood 4 those. Nothing has ever been lacking in flavor & freshness of food or service so my experiences have been 5* in every way, now & even way back in the day. (Time machine not included)! ;-)

Oh NO, don't even consider it... unless Murders, Rape & other Assaults, Violence (domestic & otherwise) Kidnapping, Drug Dealers/Addicts, Squatter Bums, Suicides, family Pets killed, Gang~Wars, Cockroaches of Every kind, regular Gunshots, Fires set in cars, dumpsters & shrubbery, Toxic Mold, unavailable Maintenance 4 Emergency situ8ions, multiple Break~ins of units/vehicles till car itself is Stolen, Harassment by own property security (when they even have 1) appeals 2 u!! Seriously, U've been WARNED...RUN!!!!     2 b fair, the 1st couple years I lived here were a pretty decent/nice place 2 call home, in my Earlier yrs of attending art school but that was a LONG time ago & under different management. Everything changed 4 the worse after suddenly the new management let some section 8 drug addicts move~in/fill an empty unit in the back of the complex. Virtually overnight from that point is when everything went 2 HELL... literally!! Crime r8 sky~rocketed as it became a haven 4 the addicts, drug~dealers, bums & all the activities that co~incide w/ such, & Completely TOOK OVER! Under~age runaway Brenda died @ 1 of the units from alcohol poisoning here (body moved/found in an alley). Also had friends other Xs being interrog8ed & harassed by cops when the criminal culprit/perpetr8ors were roaming freely.     Things got so DANGEROUS, I gathered the rest of the tenant community 2 form our own 'block~watch' of the premises & even posted our warnings all over the complex 2 warn potential residents b4 they made the big mistake of signing on. Of course each time all fliers got torn down, but after nothing was even attempted 2 b changed or corrected in any way, that was also our way of letting the so~called management know that their brazenly apathetic attitude could still hurt their future business since evidently they could care less about their existing tenants (many of them w/ children b n exposed 2 such, as most lived in back part of complex). No lights @ Night!!      I stayed WAY 2 long only due 2 my current circumstances @ the time which prevented me from leaving but by the time I could get outta dodge, they not only kept my deposits but were trying 2 nickle & dime me 4 things that were considered normal wear & tear (esp after 7 yrs) while all other units were upgraded & mine wasn't as I was living there all that time.      1 of the many things they attempted charging me 4 was the carpet 2 which I replied "then deduct it from my security deposits ur unfairly keeping, besides I know ur supposed 2 replace the carpeting every 6-12 months & I've been @ the same unit for 7 yrs! Or all the Xs I had 2 take off of work & pay out of pocket 4 Emergencies w/ Broken A/C during Summer~time w/ pets, kitchen sinks overflowing (throwing buckets of water out my front door) or had 2 change my own locks on the door due 2 break~ins because of no maintenance ever showing (not that I'd trust them anyway) all of which was never deducted from my ever increasing rent (when I was never L8 on a payment) not 2 mention the loss/damage 2 my stolen car!" (recovered 2 1/2 mo l8r in S Phoenix).      I could've fought 4 my deposits in small~claims & easily Won w/ all the evidence I had against them, but was SO El8ed 2 Finally GET OUTTA THERE, I just 4got about it & NEVER came back! But they sure didn't get another cent from me either, as it was-they're lucky I stayed even 1/2 as long as I did (since SEVERAL viol8ions of this so~called 'property management' constituted & turned in2 the very definition of: SLUM LORD)... Lower levels had water from above unit toilets leaking down in2 their units, some being my art~student friends who lived in this complex toward gradu8ion time. I could barely manage working on our class project when going 2 their apartments DISGUSTING!!! I'm sure this contributed 2 Cinna~BUGS major roach problem, or pre~existing 1 + Cave~in/Collapses (3 levels) HIGHLY POSS!!!!     Don't fall 4 being shown the model unit/bait~n~switch! That's the only way they can false~advertise worse than a shady car dealer 2 get the unsuspecting 2 believe it will b anything other than non~paying squatters staying in vacant units, only 2 break in2 urs when ur gone 2 work etc. Occasionally I find myself passing by resisting the urge 2 flip off the place & always c the scariest characters coming, going, or hanging around there.

I've been here twice b4 (reminds me due 4 another go~round when out that way again)! My 1st time was more dressed up 4 a business luncheon & my 2nd visit was after work so was dressed far more casually + not feeling well due 2 battling a migraine). Both occasions was treated w/ the same polite, helpful & professionally accomod8ing service!      Both Xs were during the evening tho the 1st trip was earlier & the 2nd was l8r. Had a reserv8ion trip 1 & just showed up the 2nd time (spontaneous decision after a walking out of the Melting pot around the way ~ a l8er review). Regardless, got us seated rather promptly @ a nice comfy booth (which I really needed @ the time cuz I was contending w/ some back issues as well then) + near the cozy fireplace was a nice added bonus!     The ambiance has an inviting homey cabin/cottage~type feel w/ a combin8ion of cobblestone & wooden beam paneling somewhat similar 2 Le Chalet & some Claim Jumper's interior. Romantic, intim8, upscale & @ the same time casual enough 2 not feel out of place if dressed down like I was on my 2nd visit. Luv these kind of atmospheres where anything goes!     I've had the Spinach salad both Xs & I have 2 say as long as they still have it on their menu, I'd make a trip just 4 this alone! It is THAT AWESOME & is the most unexpectedly complimentary combin8ion of flavors, that it is the Absolute BEST salad I've EVER had & I've seriously partaken of countless kinds that couldn't hope 2 even b a contender by comparison!! Spinach salad has grape tom8toes, green apples, dried cranberries, spiced pecans, sliced egg, crumbled blue cheese & bacon w/ poppyseed dressing (Of course there were a couple ingredients I didn't have on mine) but would gladly pay double the price!!      French onion soup is Superb & I can't get enough of their sweet potato fries!! (which I attribute 2 assist in ridding the migraine as I felt much better after having them). Also can't go wrong w/ the bruschetta & the spaghetti squash/zucchini is another gr8 dish 4 Veg~heads as well as their margherita pizza & the fresh or blackened salmon or hot crab dip if ur a pescetarian. They also have a veggie burger which I have yet 2 try & I can't account 4 their other desserts yet, but the Creme Brulee is a savory 4bidden treat! Would come here more often if it were closer 4 me, but I have nothing but glowing remarks 4 this place!!

This li'l hole in the wall loc8ed in a shopping plaza is somewhat of a diamond in the rough. They do have a tiny section in front w/ a couple of plain tables & chairs in case u want 2 eat there (no decor), but it's really known more 4 Delivery & take out (like PJ's but different style).     Have ordered their Awesome WHITE PIZZA & Scrumptious SPANIKOPITAS Countless Xs, as well as their Veggie Cold Sub, the Vegetarian Stuffed & Pesto pizzas, fried Mushrooms, Zucchini & Greek salad on occasion. They also have Amazing BAKLAVA, NY cheesecake, & Chocol8 Fudge Cake 4 desserts (all delectable depending on ur palate's mood).     There's only 1 particular time the order was wrong & nothing was done or even offered 2 correct it, so my friend  justifiably disputed some of the charges w/ his bank, hence the 4 instead of 5* r8ing. Un42n8ly I think it was a case of the preparer that evening hitting the reefer a li'l 2 much, so they really didn't care until they must have heard an earful when the reversal was discovered.     Then they tried 2 blacklist my friend 4 any future orders which was REDICULOUS as the only reason some of the charges were disputed & then reversed by his bank was due 2 the screw~up + apathetic crappy attitude from the pothead(s) that time. Not 2 mention, was ineffective as I'd just place orders from my place using my card instead 4 Deliveries or do a pick~up if I was out~n~about running errands etc so hopefully THEY learned the necessary lesson &/or eventually made replacements w/ better preppers. All I know is it didn't happen again 42n8ly 4 them because we've given them TONS of Business!!! They weren't gonna keep us from what we luved when THEY messed up once... which is personally a true compliment 2 their White Pizza, Spanikopitas, & Baklava's (our standard order).     Really, I can't slight them 4 more than 1* after all the Xs we've ordered where everything was correct, fresh & the 1derful tasty quality we'd always known them 4, so a Fave they'll remain as long as such continues 2 b the case. It bothers me when a good place can have/get a poor reflection just because of who's working that day or night (which shouldn't matter, nor b the case). So Management (if there is 1) should more closely monitor & "weed" out (pun intended) those who can hurt their biz by doing such while on the clock @ their job...

We come here 4 their Impressive Deep dish pizza's which r simply Spectacular!! Their sauce is not pasty tasting (hint of wine in it) & a couple slices feels like having eaten a full pizza in itself. We luv how saucy it is w/ their toppings underneath & the sauce on top as being that deep of a dish would b very hard 2 eat & probably caught in the throat w/o such~especially 4 the thickness it is. I'm always Amazed 1dering how they get their pizza dough so perfectly molded (2 fit all the generous portions of toppings & sauce in ur pizza pie). Really Luv our Fave = Deep Dish Tradition/style!!     Service always ranges from ok - good (depending on the server) inside the establishment which is nice inside, just not anything elabor8 ~ but why would it b as it's in a shopping center? Tables & chairs w/ disposable place~mats. But we're always there 4 the Awesome pizza anyhow & don't mind w8ing the li'l bit it takes 2 cre8 such goodness 4 our palate's & bellies, it' So Worth It!! Besides I can't imagine the disappointment of arriving home after having 2 hit the brakes a li'l 2 hard thx 2 horrible drivers we have 2 share the road w/ & c all that sauce satur8ing the box interior instead of it's perfected prepared present8ion when served up piping hot & fresh from the oven in back. MMM mmmm!!     Their Greek salad is gr8 but I luv the Vito's salad even more! We've also had their fried zucchini which always has the perfect consistency w/o being over~fried, or greasy~soggy underdone. Our fave deep dish pizza 2 order is their cheese & of course their Veggie which speaking of, their Veggie sub is pretty Amazing 2. We had a 1derful cannoli & tirumisu 4 dessert which is melt~in~ur~mouth yumminess! We Luv coming here whenever we can & I always like supporting local family owned & oper8ed establishments (this 1 has been here over 20 + yrs that I know of) which is rather self~explanatory speaking volumes over & above big~name places just across the street that hardly lasted even a yr!! Have Always Luved Vito's, always will...

There is no other place I go or recommend 4 any/all printing & business needs.  I've been going 2 c Linda @ Happy Printers 4 OVER 20 yrs now (since way back in art school getting my portfolio completed 4 gradu8ion).  She not only handles it all, but gets it done well in a timely, efficient & professional manner w/ gr8 attention 2 detail.      She may not know it, but has really saved my butt (_y_) on more than a few instances w/ some very important legal documents. It's just another amazing facet that she has the sweetest disposition & I always luv having an excuse 2 go 2 her shop, because u can't help leave there smiling & feeling good ~ she just has that effect on people w/ her warm, loving energy.  Plus she is always very accomod8ing & more than fair on her prices.  I always direct people her way because she's so #1derful @ what she does & is such a beautiful being Inside AND Out.      All it takes is a trip there 2 experience what I'm st8ing here 4 urself, & out of ALL the COUNTLESS Xs I've been there, I have yet 2 ever walk in her store no matter what she's busy contending w/ & not b greeted.  So if u like being/feeling genuinely appreci8ed 4 ur business & just BE~ing the person u r, w/ Linda @ Happy Printer's, u can't go wrong!

I've been 2 this loc8ion several Xs & have always been able 2 get what I came in 4 & even some things I didn't originally intend 2 get. As a woman, I have 2 say that this place deserves 5* as my interaction w/ most of the gents working here, never felt rude, uncomfortable or condescending in any way... even when I didn't quite know the name of things I was describing what they do, referring 2 them as thingamajiggy or whatchamacallit, they would promptly direct me right 2 whatever I was seeking. That is a Huge + in addition 2 getting the immedi8 help w/o having 2 look all over the store when pressed 4 time.     Wish 1/2 stars were available but seeing as they're not, my only reason 4 giving 1 star less is someXs the checkout gals leave quite a bit of something 2 b desired. I by no means expect some1 2 b fake or overjoyed when working, but @ least b decent 2 customers as ur the last impression we leave w/. There's been a few Xs when I was lucky 2 get a grunt from 1 of them.      Another time I had 2 turn around & come back because the discount coupon wasn't reflected on my receipt which was the entire reason we went there instead of somewhere closer. When u r the reason a customer has 2 return because u didn't deduct the coupon u were handed, please don't make it seem that 'we' messed up when we discover UR 'mistake' (if it even was 1).      Don't need an apology when it's obvious ur not sorry anyway (other than in check~out skills) but dang, would it bust a jugular 2 just b civilized? I'm always pleasant 2 people having 2 w8 on me & do my best 2 make it smooth as possible 4 them, so even tho I don't need kiss (_y_), try not 2 b so curt treating customers as the enemy. It's a li'l backasswards 4 me greeting u as u ring me up 'Wrong' & 4 me 2 b telling u 2 have a better day as I leave 2 break the discomfort of the deafening silence.     Please don't change the kind of Amazingly Helpful Gents u have working there as they & the few friendly check~out girls (that I never seem 2 get) r the main reason I keep returning. Maybe they could train the neanderthal 1's who act like grunting is gracing us w/ generosity. Save the cattiness 4 the clubs! Other than this recommended improvement, Ace certainly has been the place 2 find all my home's needs (both interior & exterior~wise) so please keep ur AWESOMENESS!!

As a long~time customer of this place, un4tun8ly giving my lowest rating thus far. Even though most other Xs have been good overall, this last time has changed my feeling about them. Over the wk~end, I had a craving 4 some chinese so an order was placed 4 pick~up instead of the usual delivery 2 avoid a tip as I had no cash on me & I don't like adding tips on cards. I had an associ8 go pick it up & when I asked 4 my receipt, I knew the total charged wasn't right (nearly $10 OVER) so I called them.      I asked 4 the amount of each item that was ordered as it wasn't reflected on the receipt & the menu I was ordering from had outd8ed prices.  Even so, calcul8ing the correct pricing it was still way over & then was told they charge 12% tax... Uhm, WHAT?? But even w/ that OUTRAGEOUS amount, some1 got paid about $10 tip for a PICK~UP order!! (Either that or I'm missing $10 worth of food I didn't order). They were given a chance 2 correct it & didn't even offer ANY rectific8ion.      I strongly feel that it doesn't matter if they knew this order was from an old~timer patron or some1 new to them (since I had some1 else picking it up) ~ if this is how they conduct business, I'm afraid I have 2 take mine elsewhere! @ least then I can get what is paid 4 instead of being ripped... EXTREMELY Disappointed in a place I USED 2 Like & frankly I should have disputed the charges on my card but they're losing much more than that in the loss of my business & what I've brought them... ;-(

After passing this place countless Xs, curiosity finally got the best of me so we finally stopped in 2 give them a try. There were a couple other occupied tables being tended 2. It was mid~day so it probably gets an influx of business in spurts during other Xs.     W8ed a couple min8es 2 b seated by a friendly hostess who seemed 2 b busy helping the w8ress(es) serve up orders/refills. Woulda preferred seating ourselves if not 4 the w8 2 b seated sign, instead of feeling awkward by the stares of the elderly patrons there but got settled in2 a centrally loc8ed small table. No booths in case u wanted 2 know.     I guess I understand the draw of this place 4 those that want the old fashioned home~style feel but dining there felt like being @ a cross between a Brass Armadillo & an Elderly Care facility. Though I did like looking @ some of the antiques 4 sale there, just felt a bit strange ~ almost like they're trying 2 pull off the ol' Bobby McGee's concept w/ vintage items like victorian boots, tubs etc but geared toward the much older.     Even tho I wasn't personally impressed or as comfortable as I'd like, everything was ok/tolerable part of our experience till we Eventually got acknowledged by our w8ress who acted as tho we were graced by her presence, snapping what~dya~want @ us. I almost replied: 'a different server'... but bit my tongue 1dering if this was just part of the 'charm'.     I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich & my companion went w/ the Seafood Omelette w/ iced tea & tomato juice 4 our beverage as she briskly walked away huffing/puffing/snorting like a bull ready 2 impale a matador. The hostess came over shortly w/ our drinks & a 1derful basket of cute li'l assorted mini muffins which turned out 2 b the best part of our meal/experience here, esp the AWESOME zucchini 1s!     Tomato juice was just V~8 in a glass & the iced tea tasted soapy & bitter. Don't know if there was soap not rinsed out in the cup but if it was straight from the tea dispenser, it was far more than soapy 'residue' & the tea part I could even make out, tasted like liquified mold so EWWW we reluctantly drank water instead w8ing 2 notify the hostess as we didn't want others getting sick or 2 evoke more wrath from the server who was intent on giving every1 hell.      When our food was ready 2 b served, she stomped over & musta mistaken our pl8es 4 frisbees as they were nearly flung @ us, mine almost skid in2 my lap!! Didn't ask if we wanted/needed anything else & was done w/ us till slamming our damages slip down when she was obviously ready 4 us 2 pay/get rid of us. The prices here might have felt like a pretty good deal if more of what we ordered was decent. Perhaps it was a case of we spontaneously picked a bad day 2 go w/ an equally bad cook & w8ress or maybe they were a couple till that morning & the break~up was gonna make every1 else suffer!!     I don't know if our server was having the worst day of her life or what, but apparently any1 else who had the mis4tune of her w8ing on them was getting the same treatment, so I guess we weren't being targeted. I even overheard a guy @ her other table telling her 'I thought I did something 2 make u mad @ me'. I couldn't make out what else was said, but it was obvious the poor hostess/cashier was trying 2 divert any neg8ivity by joking it off as something else.     The Veg sandwich was good (not gr8 nor bad but slightly better than ok). His Seafood Omelette made him spit in2 his napkin st8ing it was overly salty (probably trying 2 cover up what he called 'unfresh ingredients & bad seafood'). Leaving most of his pl8, was never asked if everything was ok or if there was a prob cuz it was blatantly apparent that the snapping turtle who could only bark @ people really didn't give a F*ck except 2 make others b the outlet 4 her nastiness!! We always treat our servers nice & respectfully, making things easier 2 b cleared (which they never were) & whatever the case was w/ this 1, she either needed 2 leave the drama @ home or better yet stay home OR here's a concept: not work in any scenario that involves having 2 interact w/ customers/public in any facet...     Kiss the Cook? More like, kiss their (_y_) A$S & still get sh*t!  IF we ever Dared 2 give them another shot (highly unlikely after what we were subjected 2), we'd b certain that some1/ANY1 else w8ed on us. Actually, scratch that ~ we'd have 2 make sure she wasn't there, cuz I'm sure I'm not the only 1 who doesn't wanna jump every other min8 w/ her slamming/snappy mouth/throwing things while trying 2 eat... nor feel like WEARING what was ordered (which depending on what it is) might b better than actually eating it ~ YIKES!!

I'd luv 2 give this place a glowing review, but due 2 my experience I still feel I'm being pretty fair under the circumstances. First the good ~ I picked this place because I needed an emergency extraction of a wisdom tooth that I could no longer put off & being it was the wk~end, the available options r kinda scarce.  Don't put off an extraction 2 long because when the pain gets as intolerable as seeing urself re~enact the Castaway scene when Tom Hanks does a self~extraction w/ an iceska8... well, it's no bueno!      The last time I had been 2 this place was @ least 13 yrs prior & since I'm a bit of a wuss when it comes 2 teeth work (who called the WHAAAAMBULANCE?) & was concerned about being put under as it could adversely affect my heart, I again turned 2 this place because they removed 1 of mine b4 all those yrs ago w/o doing so & that's the best scenario I could hope 4.     I called 2 c if I could get in & was told I didn't need an appt but could b w8ing awhile till he could fit me in somewhere which is completely understandable 4 needing 2 get seen same day on a wk~end.     Got all the paperwork submitted & the lady @ the front desk/w8ing area said there was no way 2 confirm insurance being it was the wk~end so I'd have 2 pay out of pocket.  After ?ing a couple Xs more & her feeding me the same aoutom8ed reply like a robot I just figured UGH, ok whatever it takes, just need the problem yanked out. I'll have 2 deal w/ the extra re~imbursement hassle l8er. Boy, was it ever... but I'll get 2 that ~ trying 2 keep things in succession.     After losing feeling in my legs/arse in the w8ing area, was called back 2 a little section that would become my chair (or perhaps it became me) 4 an even longer dur8ion which is fine 4 no appt & squeezing me in. What I took issue w/ was I was in immense pain & still being nice & trying 2 joke w/ the prepper/attendant  (maybe trying 2 make light of my nervousness).  This lady was stomping around like an elephant, snorting like a horse & slamming cupboards & drawers, over~clanking tools/equipment which was counter~acting my attempts 2 keep my anxiety @ bay.  When I commented "1 of those days huh?" She st8ed, "well I'm hot & hungry which is 2 of the worst things 4 me 2 b." I told her I was sorry & that it would get better.  She just stopped & glared @ me 4 a moment & then said "pthththtfft yeah" walking off.  Tried not 2 take it personally but I felt if I were 2 complete her sentence it woulda been: soon as I was outta her hair.  She came around the corner/my chair area w/ the same antics several Xs & I almost wanted 2 pay 4 her 2 go get a "HAPPY Meal" & ice~cream next door @ McDonald's b4 she touched me!! Seriously was gonna call from my chair & ask my ride in the front w8ing room 2 do so 4 me. I was close 2 leaving a couple Xs because I almost couldn't stand it (& I can really take quite a bit).     Finally, the dentist was ready 2 git-her-done which was not nearly as bad as I thought it was gonna b & I felt immedi8 relief in more ways than just the pain. When I velcro~detatched myself from the chair, I immedi8ly felt my mouth fill up w/ blood even while biting down hard on the gauze & 'miss hungry hippo' wouldn't let me spit in the sink or trash. "Can I get some more gauze then?" "Nope, there's some we're sending u home w/ along w/ ur prescriptions up front." GRrrr!!  So I proceeded 2 the front check~out area thinking: thx 4 making this feel like such a drive~thru which had everything 2 do w/ her treatment/behavior.      So 2 sum up the dentist was AWESOME & defin8ly got the necessary job done which I'm tremendously gr8ful 4 esp since it was on a wk~end when most dentist offices r closed (which is also a HUGE +)!!  Don't let the front desk lady tell u they can''t confirm ur insurance card on wk~ends (found out that was complete bull & my insurance company ended up calling her out on it) after having 2 call several Xs when they claimed 2 have sent the necessary documents via snail mail (they don't fax) which the insurance company kept denying receiving. It was apparently easier 2 charge out of pocket, (making me talk w/ a mouth full of blood 15 min + keep "saying" they sent the info 2 the insurance company.) Reimbursed 2 Mo L8r!!!     It's a shame that he has front desk so~called "help" that is anything but (emphasis on BUTT ~ (_y_)  who really likes 2 sit on it btw instead of the job she's being paid 4) & the unnecessarily gruff attendant who prepped me & then assisted him on my procedure. It would b my luck not 2 get the really nice sweetheart of a gal who was there. Since I had plenty of time 2 observe & hear the goings~on in my surroundings while becoming fused 2 that chair 4 so long, she seemed 2 b the Only 1 there (@ least that day) who had a pleasant demeanor/bed~side manner.  Still, I'd probably 'consider' coming back IF it were the down~2~biz dentist & the nice assistant I heard/witnessed helping other "chairs" along w/ a new front desk record person.

This is def 1 of my Absolute Favor8 places 2 go every opportunity I can & I'd luv 2 give them a Perfect score but unfortun8ly out of the countless Xs I've been there, my 1st experience there doesn't allow 4 that 2 b the case. Guess it's pretty impressive that out of all those Xs since, it's been nothing but an EXCEPTIONAL experience Every single time in service & food (other than WAY 2 much salt on popcorn once), but it still can't take away what wasn't handled as it should have been 4 the 1st impression. Have dined in both the fork & screen & the Cinema Suites (both r Gr8 but our preference is the Suites: b~n roomier & more luxurious)!     My 1st visit was 4 a special occasion 2 celebr8 the birthday of my very special guest.  Unfortun8ly it never fails, there was a crazy lady seated 2 our left in the row behind us.  I'd like 2 think she had tourette's syndrome but found out rather quickly she was a deliber8 instig8or &/or a bitter attention wh*re hag who was trying 2 ruin every1 else's time, not just immedi8ly around her but in the entire theater. 4 whatever reason (in her head) she put most of her focus upon us.       It was well b4 the previews & the server was explaining everything 2 us while taking our initial order of appetizers & drinks.  She kept clearing her throat way 2 loud whenever any1 was ordering anything but when our server came back w/ our drinks, she loudly said "Gonna order anymore b*tch?" right as the noise of the present preview ended.  Every1 including our server looked @ her as she tried 2 play off not saying it while loudly eating her tub of popcorn worse than the cookie monster off Sesamee Street.       We assumed our w8er left 2 notify management but that wasn't the case.  She continued w/ her antics throwing her popcorn & insults all through the final preview & on in2 the start of the movie.  My guest went 2 notify management & 2 c if the w8er was in process of doing so.  I sat there clenching the arm rest trying not 2 turn in2 a She~Hulk while we were missing the opening.      Our w8er was busy tending 2 his orders but confirmed what had happened 2  management which my guest relayed.  Returning, he came back w/ some lady "manager" (using that term very loosely) confronting the lady who immedi8ly burst in2 tears playing the victim & claiming she had a headache & would apologize 2 us after the show (like that was supposed 2 make everything ok/understood).      Then the manager approached me & I told her if that woman didn't like the fact that this was a dine~in cinema she could go 2 a regular theater (as she's still chowin' down on her popcorn like nothing happened~crocodile tears dried) & that we were in no way being loud or disruptive (unlike her).  We were told not 2 talk 2 her & that "she said she'd apologize 2 us after the movie."  We're thinking, What?? So ur not going 2 take care of the problem that the entire theater was having 2 deal w/ & then tell US not 2 talk 2 her when nothing warranted this HARASSMENT of US & some1 trying 2 ruin things 4 others?  Sorry, that's NOT good enough!!      The PROBLEM should have been REMOVED/had 2 LEAVE especially since the w8er confirmed what happened as the entire theater could.  It SHOULD have been CORRECTED even if it meant giving psycho lady off~her~meds a refund!!  Sad part is that doesn't even apply 2 her as everything was so blatantly intentional.  Part of HER PROBLEM trying 2 project on2 others seems 2 b she had an issue w/ others ordering from the menu while she only had popcorn.  And if she wasn't such a nasty miserable being, we might have actually paid anonymously 4 her 2 select something 4 herself.       Shame on that so~called "manager", thus the 4 instead of 5* rating!!  The only apology we got was from our server (we didn't care 2 hear from the wierdo lady who should b gr8ful we're the people we r instead of following her 2 her car or residence) but replied "unfortun8ly we can't control the actions/behavior of others but something can b done when these situ8ions/nuisances present themselves & SOMETHING should have been!"  Then a couple following behind us on the way out of the theater said "oh yeah that crazy lady was Horrible, WE almost left ~ Absolutely NO excuse 4 that!"  Glad 2 know obviously we weren't the only 1s feeling that way...

I go 2 "StarF*cks" once in a blue moon or so 4 an iced caramel macchiatto or during holiday seasonal eggnog chai rel8ed drinks/teas which is probably a good thing cuz let's face it, as good as certain things may taste ~ most items r'nt good 4 ur health or waistline.      I personally suggest nixing on the "CRAP~uccino's" @ this loc8ion tho, any1 I've ever come w/ who's partaken of any were disappointed in the sour bitter after~taste (unless that's ur preference). SomeXs they come up w/ some tasty Veg~head alter8ive items here on their menu like: spinach tomato ciabatta or tomato croissant pastry that tastes almost like pizza, just wish they would offer these type items on a more regular instead of temporary basis.     I usually go thru the drive~up window & have only been inside a couple Xs, each of those setting off my claustrophobia as it's a very confined space here & spills/mishaps r frequent. Can only imagine the mayhem when slammin'/maximum capacity.  No thx, keepin' w/ the drive~thru whenever I go even if it moves snail pace during higher influx periods. Besides there's Sonic tables right next door 2 sit @ away from the chaos, confusion & deafening noise. SB do have some tables outside but they're very limited & 2 close 2 all that hustle/bustle 2 converse.     Most Xs all the baristas service is accur8, friendly & accomod8ing tho there have been a couple occasions when inside, I noticed some p8ient patrons getting frustr8ed w8ing 4ever 4 their orders (or lack~there~of) lost perhaps or maybe a new employee in training? I've not had a bad experience tho myself in all the occasions I've frequented other than not caring 4 the uncomfortable interior @ this locale so I'll still frequent here, just not very regularly... unless they start offering some healthier & make some Veg options more available, but still a pretty good place!

Sorry not 2 recall any names but I hope employees r getting the bonus &/or raise increases they are entitled 2, as there's no other place we've gotten such FANTASTIC service in ALL respects especially EVERY time I visit this store! Thx 4 hiring such OUTSTANDING workers which includes the attentive & humorous front desk/waiting area personnel, the new employee w/ the AWESOME personable attitude (who we heard was his 1st day working there) & the ones behind the scenes doing such efficiently thorough tire repair work to ensure the safe operation of our personal vehicles!     The guy who returned my vehicle when it was ready was the cake topper 2 us leaving your store, having the best experience yet! I always tell everyone I know there's no other place I'd entrust or gamble w/ for my tire needs which is also why whenever it's time to purchase new tires, it's never the slightest question where I'm getting them. Besides, they've saved me TONS of $$$ in free repairs from patches 2 valve stem leaks, tire rot8ions etc over the yrs, so I'm sure I speak 4 many customers in what I've said here: that if having to spend our hard-earned money when it's time 4 new tires, there's no other place that deserves the business more than them!      Being impressed is an understatement...who knew that having 2 get tire work done could be such a pleasantly smooth, happy & professional experience? Fortun8ly we do! Makes me feel sorry 4 the 1s who don't know yet...

Passed thru here the other night on my way home 4 their happy hour 1/2 off drinks, dessert shakes. Got a pineapple upside down master blaster & a cheesecake shake. They don't skimp on toppings or ingredients (there's a reason why any of the remaining DQ's stopped doing their upside~down test when going 4 the occasional Blizzard or 2 sample a new flavor).      I don't get much in the way of food here since becoming a Veg~head so I can't vouch 4 other menu items but I do remember everything b4~hand being pretty decent 4 what it is & I really hope they keep their sweet potato tots on the menu as I like them even better than the regular tots (which is already a lot)!      I find myself here from time 2 time 4 their happy hour specials or on their patio area when I don't wanna drink my StarF*cks or have it spilled on me in the whirlwind constrained claustrophobia of next door.     The hop servers here have always been friendly, johnny~on~the~spot & even when I've been in tow w/ other friends because they wanted something from here, orders have always been correct, warm & fresh so there's no bad experiences I've had or witnessed. I feel they deserve 5* = the drinks/desserts & service, just wasn't a fave of that kinda food back when I did have it, other than their tots & especially the sweet potato kind which r the Bomb!!

Had a really enjoyable time here 2night, my dinner d8 & I had a business dinner w/ a dear friend & were pretty impressed w / the amazing food & service in a quaint little atmosphere. Surroundings did sometimes get pretty loud from other patrons (even when not Happy Hour) but their blender or whatever it was put that 2 shame w/ ear~bleeding screechiness . Seriously, it's dead, get a new 1 already! Really, the only reason they're getting 4 instead of 5 as we had 2 b subjected 2 it about 3 Xs tho coulda been worse since we were there 4 a few hrs, but dang EARPLUGS any1?     We were seated @ a booth & happily greeted by our w8tress who started us off w/ our drink orders. Unsweetened raspberry tea 4 me, the guys got sodas. Shortly after placing our orders we were presented w/ a bread basket which had adorable mini sz looking french bread loaves & a darker bread which had walnuts (not sure what else) but was delicious!      I went w/ the Les Artichoke Frites (fried artichoke hearts w/ a very complimentary aioli sauce) & a bowl of tomato/basil soup. My dinner d8 had the grilled Salmon w/ french Lentils & our business friend had the Signature Bouillabaisse which is a traditional Provençal~seasoned soup w/ mussels, shrimp & scallops simmered in white wine w/ potatoes & tomatoes served with garlic French baguette croutons. They finished w/ a decadent Creme Brulee Cheescake  By all accounts, EVERYTHING WAS SCRUMPTIOUS & it being my 1st time here will certainly consider returning!! But perhaps a different locale, unless earplugs r needed @ other 1's 2...

What's not 2 like about a home~cooked meal in nice cabin~style atmosphere? Upon entering this establishment a 1derful combin8ion of smells welcomes ur senses w/ warm inviting outdoorsy earthy tones that makes u wanna get comfortable & stay awhile.     We were promptly greeted then seated by the pleasant hostess @ a nice cushy booth where we acticip8ed viewing all the options 2 select from. I've been here a couple of Xs once 4 breakfast & another 4 lunch. Our friendly w8tress who greeted us took our drink orders filling us in on the specials, leaving us more time 2 decipher what we wanted 2 go w/.     I finally decided 2 start w/ a breakfast pastry called a cherry bear~claw which certainly didn't disappoint, then a vegetarian omelette w/ sliced avocado on top ~ fresh quality & complimentary ingredients that made my taste~buds sing.      I've also had the oh~so~YUMMY California Benedict (minus the bacon) which is an English Muffin w/ spinach, grilled tomato, avocado, 2 poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce, fluffy biscuits & flavorful gravy, cinnamon roll french toast, sweet cream waffle/pancakes ~ all which were golden Perfection & sweetness (of course u can always go overboard w/ the syrup if u choose, but it's the Good stuff ~ no artificial fake nasty after~taste sweeteners here)...     My personal Fave is the Harvest Tossed Salad which has dried cranberry, cherry, blueberry, golden raisin, mushroom, bell pepper, onion, almond, walnut & pecan in a lite honey Dijon dressing topped w/ fresh strawberries/toasted coconut & will always make room 4 their delectable signature secret recipe home~made bread pudding w/ pecan praline sauce!!  Sorry if this makes u saliv8 but this is my sampling of an Amazing place w/ Awesome food complete w/ Gr8 service/atmosphere @ a very reasonable cost 2 boot & find myself thinking often of going back more than I get 2...

I used 2 frequent this loc8ion but not anymore!! My mind was made up never 2 return after what I witnessed on my last visit here... The layout of the store as well as produce & selections was pretty good Most of the time tho they didn't carry several items that I found @ other Sprouts (several Xs made requests but none of them ever made it 2 this store or their shelves).     Also, stay away from the Nosa brand yogurt as even tho the expir8ion d8 reflects it should b ok, something is amiss either handling~wise dur8ion of it's trip or the marked d8es have been tampered w/ because nieces complained it tasted funny & got sick after having some. I tested it myself after they complained & nearly threw up/spitting out the nastiness which can only b described as rotten mold. EWWW!!!!        Steer clear of the Gluten~Free tortillas & the english muffins (which u can chip a tooth on). The tortillas can't even b folded in 1/2 without breaking apart so they r useless & the english muffins were hard as a rock (even after a li'l nuke job) & not edible even w/ water as a chaser due 2 their dryness but had 2 b thrown out a day l8er as they were already growing fuzzy home~grown penicillin! Waste of $$ when u SPEND MORE 4 Gluten~Free & don't even get 2 use said items!!    Now 4 the clincher that turned me off completely from ever stepping foot here again. I was being checked out by 1 of the nicest cashiers I had yet 2 encounter @ that store & she had 2 call the manager up because they were running a $20 off gift card promotion w/ the purchase of $100 in groceries. I needed 2 as my total was a li'l over $200.      That manager guy was an idiot of Epic proportions in how he treated his employee!! I stood there dumbfounded in disbelief @ the way he was ber8ing her in front of me & was made 2 feel he was being so put out of his way 2 come authorize the transaction. I kept thanking her 4 being so helpful & doing such a gr8 job hoping he would get a hint what an (_i_) he was being, but he knew he was being a deliber8 pr*ck & having visions of being incarcer8ed, I really had 2 hold myself back from putting him in his place!! If he felt that comfortable degrading a Female new~hire of African American descent in front of customers no less ~ like he can do whatever he wants & they just have 2 take it if they need that job, I can only imagine the Monstrous bASS~TURD he'd b 2 them out of customers observ8ions GRRRrr!!! Filed a complaint 2 corpor8 but don't know what/if anything ever came of it... Besides ALL this, I wouldn't come here after they got hacked w/ their zon card machines anyway!!

Was kinda dragged here as I'm not any kind of sports fanatic nor usually a fan of the kind of food that tends 2 correl8 w/ such, but have 2 say I was rather pleasantly surprised by my visit here.     Nice atmosphere & interior welcomed our fairly large party, far different from the obnoxious overbearingly loud rowdiness & tacky sport team coloring typically found in similar places. Of course it was lunch & not much in the way of games was happening @ the time but hey, I'll take it whenever I have 2 accompany my sport~luving eating companions.     Our w8tress was very friendly, professional, efficiently accomod8ing ~ I especially liked how she interacted w/ my friend's kids who were in tow. She was either a mom herself or just knew how 2 make kids feel as important as the adults.      I started w/ the Spinach Queso Dip & a side of sweet potato fries which were both amazing in their flavors, texture & consistency. Fries were Perfect: outer crispness soft inside ~ not greasy, limp or overly~fried. Spinach Queso Dip was 'almost' up there w/ my fave = Elephant Bar's (which is saying A Lot)!       4 my entree I ordered the Strawberry Field's Salad (sans the chicken of course) & it was SUPERB. It comes w/ a bed of mixed greens (grilled chicken), strawberry wedges, candied pecans, feta cheese and strawberry vinaigrette which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ~ I was so blown away by it's Goodness I placed another order of it 2~go & tried seeing if I could buy some of that AMAZING strawberry dressing 4 personal use @ home but 2 no avail, wasn't available that way (or they're keepin' it a secret)!     I noticed there r quite a few different options available 4 Veg~heads here & of course dishes can b customized minus items such as what I did w/ the salad which was my Fave of all the 1derful things I'd partaken of while here. So YES I look 4ward 2 returning UN~reluctantly 2 try other things from their surprisingly extensive menu & might even brave Superbowl in full swing 2 do so (which is the personal BIGGEST COMPLIMENT they can get from me)!! Majerle's just acquired another fan... just 4 different reasons ~ Tee~hee! ;-)

I tend 2 have a flair 4 things that r different, being unique in concept & this place offers some beautiful artistic "arrangements" & even though they won't die like flowers, need 2 b eaten while still fresh as they r cre8ed w/ an array of fruit, some even dipped in chocol8 & drizzled like confections.     They have many price ranges & vari8ions of fruit ranging from strawberries/bananas/apples (choc covered or not), cantaloupe, honeydew, grapes, orange slices, pineapple & can omit or customize 2 ur liking/dietary preference 4 ur recipient(s). Certain fruits r in cookie cutter shapes 2 coincide w/ holiday themes.     I called this loc8ion 2 personalize an arrangement sent as a Thank U/Get Well 2 b delivered 2 a household in the area & was assisted 2 cre8 the vision I had between 2 different arrangements I liked.  It took some improvising as the vase I wanted them 2 have as a keepsake could only fit certain things but we finally got it figured out in place of certain fruit, adding a bit more color/contrast /decadence in2 it w/ an order of chocol8 dipped apple slices w/ white drizzle which made me very happy (just of course lighter in the wallet).     Like flowers, these will have similar fees (delivery etc) & r perishable, but will b appreci8ed in TWO respects instead of just 1 ~ beautiful 2 look @ until they r consumed (& perhaps 3 if ur like me & send it w/ a keepsake after they've been enjoyed). I recommend searching 4 coupons 4 a li'l savings b4 placing an order w/ this novel concept. Certainly no regrets here & my recipients still carry on about it, 1dering who "spoiled them w/ such a beautifully tasty surprise"...  ;-)

WOW, so glad we were in the area & saw this fondue place! Feeling famished after running errands all over town, decided 2 give them a try & so glad we did (esp after walking out of a Melting Pot in Scottsdale which will b a l8er review). Passing this place on the road, we wouldn't have thought it was a restaurant if it weren't 4 the fondue banner so Yay 4 that!     Upon entering, we took in the ambiance which felt welcoming & a combin8ion of intim8, romantic but yet casual setting @ the same time. We really like places that have that nice upscale feel without having 2 feel out of place if not dressed up. We opted 2 sit on the more casual looking side near the open kitchen area (the other section of the interior 2 the right as ur entering was even nicer so we'll opt 4 that side sometime when dressed up a li'l more than what we were wearing 4 running errands out in the heat).     We sat @ a table that had a connected booth on 1 side & chairs on the other (interesting 2 have either choice @ same table, esp 4 those w/ back issues) while taking in all the offerings on their extensive lunch menu. After much deliber8ion we finally made our selections of Roquefort 6" Flammenkuchen & the Mont St Michel Crepe Wrap 4 appetizers, the Alaskan smoked salmon blinis salad, Mediterranee Sea Scallops w/ Leeks & Saffron sauce 4 our entrees complete w/ a side of sweet potato fries, & a decadent Salted Butter Caramel crepe & Crepe Williams w/ pears 4 dessert. Me thinks we died cuz EVERYTHING couldn't have been more HEAVENLY!!!     Service was Exceptional in every way from the pleasant hostess who greeted/seated us 2 our 1derful on~the~ball w8tress who never inquired about refills cuz she made sure they never got close 2 empty. We even made friends w/ an older out~of~town couple from Prescott who l8r sat next 2 us as we exchanged... Ooh, what's that ur having? I'm sure this place hears that a lot!!     So if Amazingly complimentary flavors & textures w/ perfect seasonings & gooey forbidden delights is ur palate's fancy, this is Defin8ly a go~2 place & our taste~buds can't w8 2 return 4 more @ our soonest opportunity ~ they were certainly thanking us that wk~end... A new Fave!!

We went to this place Twice while visiting our favor8 zoo yesterday, once 4 lunch outside while viewing the flamingos from the patio under misters & l8er 4 dinner inside w/ the AMAZING aquarium. Both Xs were THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE in Food, Service & Experience!      We were pretty famished after going all over the grounds running on empty in the heat & ready 2 c what offerings we could have from their extensive menu. We were pleasantly surprised 2 c there were several selections for us Veg~heads 2 choose from even tho they r known 4 their Bbq. Yay 4 us!!      Already a gr8 start, we were promptly greeted by an AWESOMELY ATTENTIVE server named HEATHER(server 40422) who took our drink & appetizer orders & single handed-ly gave not only us but the ENTIRE PATIO the most STELLAR service I've seen (esp 4 a place that busy)! Flustered was not in her vocabulary as she simultaneously got us started, other's served their orders/refills, clearing pl8es, & wrapped up people closing their bills complete w/ their discount coupons, making it Look effortless all w/ a commendably friendly & professional winning attitude. This gal truly was impressive & I almost luved observing/witnessing/hearing her in action as much as the flamingos ~ WOW!!     So we ordered passion fruit tea, Portabello Spinach Artichoke Dip 2 start, Peach salad w/ prickly pear vinigarette dressing & their Spinach enchilada platter. Pl8es were Huge w/ Generous portions & gr8 present8ion. As hungry as we were, we actually had 2 box up what we couldn't finish & run it our 2 the car. Everything we had became an instant fave & when I'm craving cold/cool food I'll have 2 go w/ the Peach salad which also had craisins, candied walnuts/pecans over combin8ion greens & Perfectly complimented w/ the Prickly Pear Vinigarette dressing (no arm~twisting needed). No room 4 dessert even tho there were def a few I put on the 2~try list 4 l8er.      Early eve had the expected w8 (esp since we showed up w/o a reserv8ion) & we opted 4 outside patio again if it meant getting seated sooner, but much 2 our surprise we were asked if we'd like 2 dine inside near aquarium as 1 was cleared/opened up. Can we say YAY Again 4 the unexpected upgrade? Nice~Woo~hoo!!     We got seated right next 2 the aquarium near 1 corner of the curv8ure. Our w8ress this time was the very nice efficient Tobie (server 96534) who greeted us fairly quickly getting our order of their award winning onion rings started & tried the hibiscus green tea which was just as thirst quenchingly good as the passion fruit we had earlier. She was also a pretty Gr8 server ~ never had 2 w8 4 refills or our bill when ready. The only w8 other than 2 b seated of course was 4 our items 2 b prepared & nothing took very long ~ not 2 mention taking in all the beautiful marine life swimming right by us. I went w/ the Spinach Quesadilla & my companion ordered the Prickly Peach Salad this time which had an interesting marmalade blended in2 the dressing. Yummy!!      The onion rings were pretty 1derful as was the Spinach Quesadilla & all the spinach artichoke dishes I'd highly recommend 4 those that like that kind of dip. The only thing I might suggest was the red onions being sauteed instead of raw even though it was still very good cut in2 julienne style pieces as well as ensuring all the diced tomato on our Spinach enchiladas r all ripe. Also the chips were very good tho just a couple a little over~fried, but some may prefer them that way. Why no sweet potato fries @ this loc8ion? Def woulda tried them... We really enjoyed the aquarium & knew not 2 expect a quiet uneventful dining experience as there is going 2 b excited kids about in addition 2 the hussle & bustle of any good establishment.      Really wish some parents/grandparents would b better overseers of children/toddlers. This is NOT a charity daycare/kiddy playland 2 let them run rampantly unattended as servers already have enough obstacles w/o having 2 watch 4 tripping over ur kids while attempting 2 get full trays of HOT food 2 their tables. Really, r u KiDding me?? I'm sure they'd b the 1st 2 scream lawsuit if that very possibly happened 2!! That's really sad when a stranger cares more by watching/preventing something bad from happening 2 them SEVERAL Xs throughout our meal ~ Rediculous!! Yeah, go back 2 drinking but next time don't bring the kids or 4 gosh sakes pay 4 a babysitter since u don't watch them, not 2 mention the choking hazard every time I get knocked in2 from behind while trying 2 eat... Geesh!!      Again had no room 4 dessert so that will have 2 come l8er but Dillon's easily became a FAVE place that we'll frequent whenever we can/find ourselves out this way which is usually when frequenting the Perfectly paired 1Derful zoo!

Any time I find myself @ this mall, I HAVE 2 stop here (just a hop~skip~jump around the corner from the food court) & sample whatever new flavors sound appealing, (most of them) which always results in a cup of 2-3 different kinds in a cup or waffle cup if I spontaneously really wanna splurge. Plus it's healthier than regular ice~cream w/o the funky after~taste that's rampantly found in other frozen treat places that use artificial additives/sweeteners.      Some staple flavors r different vari8ions of chocol8 (dark & white), cheesecake, coconut, different pie flavors & mousse types + there r always good selections available 4 Veg~heads 2 (this time there was pineapple, mango, cantaloupe, lemon, key~lime, a mixed berry kind (blackberry, raspberry, strawberry) even a Patron kind which I didn't try but many were sampling. Some, a li'l 2 eagerly I might add ~ may need 2 b carding! (hee~hee)     Every time, no matter what I finally decide on, I savor the Fantastic velvety goodness & try 2 make it last as long as possible, wishing there was more by the time I reach scraping the bottom (or eating the bowl itself, the waffle 1 of course)! The only thing I might change would b their super~tiny spoons (same 1s when given samples) but maybe it's supposed 2 b that way 4 gelato (it does prevent wolfing it down 2 fast).     Always happy 2 c this place still open/oper8ional & appears busy whenever I go, but never have 2 w8 long. I also appreci8ed the Amazingly assertive, friendly & helpful multi~tasking sampler/server guy's knowledge of anti~oxidants which gave me a good laugh & told him he knew his stuff. This place is just as good as the elabor8ly presented 1s found on Scottsdale Rd, so def worth a try in my book (& ALWAYS Yummy in ur palate & tummy)!

I hate to give any place a low rating but getting ripped off is NOT ok so I suppose if they even care, they're lucky getting 2 instead of 1 ~ even though we WON'T b back!! Filibertos used 2 b the place that any other fill~in~the~blank: berto's tried 2 imit8. Gone r the days of nice ample portions 4 decent prices & quite frankly I haven't really considered them Filiberto's 4 awhile now... more like fill~their~pockets while giving u the shaft.      Burritos u can expect 2 b mostly tortilla/hardly any filling & if they were @ least longer & skimpy or stumpy but fat it might b ok, but here we go again w/ another drive~ thru mexican place that's cutting corners & charging more 4 less in quality, ingredients, quantity & don't even get me started on the so~called service aspect. (more complete lack~there~of).      Order & get charged 4 a Large Pina & discover it's water results in them looking @ u crazy like ur trying 2 get something 4 free when u tell them. Uhm, no just would like 2 get something close 2 what I ordered & paid 4. And speaking of water... red & green sauce cups r 1/2 filled & mostly water w/ color & little flavoring & they just love throwing them in ur bag on top of whatever u order so it gets all over the place & satur8es napkins (if they even include them) cuz they don't secure the cheap lids, even when u ask 4 them in a seper8 bag. Yeah, they understood me (I've asked both in English & in Spanish). Yes a 'gringa' can talk Spanish fluently... ;-p     And I really don't get why a "drive~thru" can take SOooo Long when u discover there's nowhere near the food in ur bag that Filiberto's used 2 b famous 4. As I've said b4, if any place inevitably increases their prices as often will b the case, @ least let it b equivalent 2 what it was b4. Also when a Veg~head orders the very limited items we have 2 choose from & almost every time finds some meat that somehow managed 2 b in their pl8 or burrito, that's a Huge EWWW!!  So will we ever c Fili(F*ck)tards again? Best Amy Winehouse voice echoes No, no, NO!!!

Went here on a whim w/ my companion last sat 2 try it out. Last time I'd been here was w/ an associ8 back when it used 2 b China Star. Seemed pretty much the same setup/layout except w/ a sushi bar & more of a dessert selection. They also had tapioca but I didn't partake of any due 2 the color looking a bit 'off'. Coulda been the lighting but chose not 2 risk it.     The interior is pretty decent 4 what it is, better than other buffet places & w/o the stinky carpet! I Remember when this used 2 b a Red Lobster back in the day b4 China *. At the entrance they have a nice li'l area where u can c all the beautiful Koi fish swimming around. A child or (kid~@~heart's) delight ~ a li'l boy was having a ball, screeching w/ excitement.     We chose a booth in the corner, which was our mistake as we were ignored 4 most of our time there (or Maybe unseen if giving more benefit of the doubt, even tho the demeanor of the so~called server(s) w/ the exception of 1(whom we ensured got our tip) makes the 1st st8ment more likely. We kept getting scratched up because both our booth seats were ripped & the attempted tape on the 1 side kept sticking more 2 his skin than covering what was intended. Perhaps they got that way as a result of 2 many who gorged themselves there. Hee~hee     Anyhoo, the place has about 100 or more selections of entrees, soups, all fave appetizers 2 pick & choose from, most of them being seafood items of course, hence it's name but there's also veggies, fruit, noodles, salads, toppings, ice creams, cakes & all vari8ions of meats 4 the carnivores . The sushi bar is off seper8ly as expected 4 cold items & has a picture board 2 help identify the different kinds & their contents. This turned out 2 b my favor8 4 the california rolls (iniri was pretty good 2)!  I might have missed it or perhaps was a little overwhelmed by all the choices but was disappointed I couldn't find the wasabi which I'd usually blend w/ a little water/soy sauce 2 lessen it's kick. Even w/o sauce they were really good, just would have enjoyed it even more w/ it.     The only thing I'd do differently (other than sitting @ a different booth) is 2 get there when they open 2 enjoy everything @ their freshest, but really can't complain as it's equivalent 2 a Golden Corral w/ more of an oriental flair & a vast array of seafood dishes @ a decent price! And of course we'll look 4 the pretty latino gal ~ the only Nice/real 'server' we encountered, who saw we were w8ing 4 refills & immedi8ly tended 2 that as she just came in 4 her shift. Will get her name on a future visit & this place is defin8ly a nice option 2 have in the area... we left stuffed! So if u like 2 experiment, sampling several different things 4 ur palate, this might b the perfect place 4 u 2 do so...

My lunch d8 & I had an ALL AROUND 1DERFUL experience here 2day & I'm so glad we randomly decided 2 give this new loc8ion a try!!  The atmosphere was even nicer than their old 1 (which is now Hooters), ALL employees & manager(s) were EXCELLENT, busy tending 2 guests & making sure everything was gr8 ESPECIALLY our server Michael B & of course everything we consumed was SUPERB!!      I started w/ some fried zucchini & they had a sampler platter w/ stuffed mushrooms, chicken fingers & mozzarella sticks. Then I had the minestrone soup w/ salad & bread sticks & my friend got the chicken parmigiana. 4 dessert the wild berry cake had 2 b sampled which we shared & they also ordered the choose 3 Dolcini's: Amaretto Tiramisu, Limoncello & Dark Chocol8 Caramel Mousse. EVERYTHING DELECTABLY DELICIOSO!! MMMmm mmm good (not talkin' Campbell's either)...     We were there nearly 2 hours catching up & never felt rushed while thoroughly enjoying all the offerings. I have NEVER BEEN SO IMPRESSED w/ the staff @ an establishment!! Not only was our w8er AMAZING in EVERY facet that a server can b, but we were checked on by @ least 1 manager & even had 2 other people occasionally helping by refilling our drinks, serving our appetizers & even a bus person when we were near leaving who cleared our table of dessert dishes & was such a sweet young man, I wanted 2 leave him a tip 2 if I had more cash on me.      What AWESOME teamwork, we didn't have 2 want or really w8 4 anything the whole time we spent there!! We noticed every1 else being tended 2 in the same REMARKABLE fashion & even a large party b~day celebr8ion next 2 our booth w/o any surrounding tables falling by the wayside. Will defin8ly b returning & if u find urself on this part of town, I highly recommend this Olive Garden & ask if there's a table in Michael B.'s section if he's working when u go!!...

I was so glad/relieved 2 c this loc8ion open up, not just because it was more convenient but also I was growing increasingly more leery about filling up @ the 27th/Northern 1 I used 2 go 2 since the panhandling/begging had become increasingly worse ~ so much so, that u could c them beating each other off 2 c who could b the 1st 1 2 hit u up 4 cash (usually accompanying a story). Many Xs this was the scenario in plain view of cops who never did anything 2 thwart it. Didn't matter if it was broad daylight or night time. I'm not 1 2 judge but there were several occasions it was obvious the askers were needing their 'fix' which could turn in2 a problem/safety issue w8ing 4 ur gas 2 finish being pumped while giving them an answer they don't want 2 accept. That's not been my experience since coming here!     I usually go here 2 fill up the tank or get the occasional money order or drink & no matter how busy/long a line may b, we get greeted & most Xs sent off w/ a have a good day, come again or c u next time. I don't need 2 hear thx but it's a big thing in my book 2 b acknowledged & no matter who's working we get this EVERY TIME w/o fail. This store has always been clean & efficient in it's service I especially like that QT has the 'Safe Place' 4 youths in crisis so I certainly don't mind giving them my business!!

I've officially discovered a #1Derful new favorite place 2 conduct business luncheons w/ associ8es, & get 2gethers w/ friends &/or clients (they have take-out 2) while enjoying saliv8ingly savory fare 4 my very selective palate.     Let me start by saying Thai isn't typically a favorite type of food 4 me (a bit 2 spicy other locales), but this place really won me over!! I used 2 frequent this loc8ion quite a bit when it was a mongolian grill place back in the day, so a dear friend & I decided 2 venture in 2 check out the menu of this new place (@ least 2 us). Didn't take long b4 we knew we were gonna stay, getting 2 choose where we sat 2 go over their extensively impressive regular menu & lunch specials.     Took a long time 2 make up our minds on an entree as each item sounded even better than the 1 read b4, so I tried a UNIQUELY AMAZING out-of-this-world Tapioca coconut smoothie called Boba, there's nothing like it & they have several other flavors 2 choose from: strawberry, avocado, mango, papaya, taro, honeydew (there may b more, can't remember them all). We decided 2 start w/ the crispy Veggie Rolls 4 an appetizer which comes w/ the perfect complimentary sauce ~HIGHLY RECOMMENDED~  till we could finger (oopsie, meant figure) out the main courses we wanted. Really they're a top finger food 2 try 4 only $2 to boot!    After wolfing them down, we were brought a delectable cup of soup Tom Yum/Tom Ka (1 w/ meat, 1 w/ cutest tiny tofu squares) No musical dishes please! I finally decided on the Green Curry w/ Assorted Vegetables as I'm Vegan (Tofu is available 2) but carnivorous choices are: chicken, pork, beef & $2 if u want shrimp. My lunch d8 ordered the Stir~Fried Ginger w/ Chicken (they R'nt a Veg~head so we can give a sampling of both spectrums).    Both presentable entrees had ample portions, being quickly consumed even between lengthy convers8ions. Btw, OUR SERVER WAS PERFECT & took care of Entire restaurant including 2~go orders in a friendly, efficient & professional manner. He was inform8ively helpful, p8ient, & had 1 of the best dispositions I've experienced ever w/ a w8er!!    What I REALLY LOVE about this place other than the AWESOME Food w/ FRESH QUALITY ingredients, EXCEPTIONAL Service, & Convenient Loc8ion is that all dishes can b CUSTOMIZED/PERSONALIZED 2 ur liking or dietary needs. Mild or Spicy, with or without meat & several selections 2 meet ur  preference. They even have a special GLUTEN~FREE soy sauce (w/ the green cap) 4 Celiacs/Gluten intolerants.    The classy/casual atmosphere is perfect 4 dressed up or down w/ marble tables & beautifully quaint decor. We dined among patrons who wore stuffy business attire, shorts flip~flops & t's, & even construction workers... how cool is that to find a nice comfortable anything~goes environment where no1 felt out of place?    There r MANY more dishes I anticip8 trying in the very near future such as Papaya salad & sticky rice w/ Mango dessert (when in season) 2 name a couple but I'd encourage any1 2 give them a try, coming from some1 who usually didn't care much 4 the usual THAI, Karen Thai Cuisine is far from typical @ pleasantly exceeded ALL expect8ions in an all~encompassing fashion!    Now might b a perfect time 2 take them up on some savings w/ their $35 for $25 deal ~ Didn't know about it b4 going, but was still WELL WORTH THE $27 Tot spent 4 both of us & afterwards bought deal 2 use 4 l8er as I'll def b returning!!! (Didn't say: b back as that Arnold quote is so overplayed/used & people really need 2 start getting original anyhow). Hope this helps those who actually got through it (even tho u might b cross~eyed by now) SS! It's only fair after enjoying such a delightful experience, that this STELLAR eatery receives the review they're deserving of...

So I returned following day 2 redeem the yelp deal, but this time w/ 1 of my vegetarian dinner d8es so they could get familiar w/ their offerings. It was even busier this time which I expected being it was Sat Evening as opposed 2 a Wk~Day.  We had the same server who appears 2 pretty much run the entire establishment (except 4 all the cooking) w8ing on us & all the other patrons in the restaurant & did so w/o a hitch. Seriously, think this Super Server guy should wear a cape!  ;-)     I started w/ the Crispy Veggie Rolls again (had 2 b done)!  He ordered the Fried Tofu appetizer.  Both Scrumptious items were shared & gone in minutes.  I suggested he try a Boba tapioca drink which he selected the Mango flavor, savoring it 4 dur8ion of our dining experience. They're served w/ really thick straws which r required 4 retrieving the tapioca  pearls from the bottom of the glass. Refer 2 smoothie looking pic some1 posted of 1 of these concoctions YUMMY!!     He went w/ the Pineapple Fried Rice w/ shrimp which also had scallions, carrots, cilantro, green onions & cashew nuts.  I ordered the Stir Cashew Nut w/ Tofu which comes w/ bell peppers, water chestnuts, carrots, onions & cashew nuts in sauce.  Both were HEAVENLY, tasting as good as they smelled.  I don't eat shrimp, so I tasted his dish w/o it eating any of those.       I have 2 say the present8ion of all dishes I've seen r served very artistically & I appreci8 when the taste/flavor, smell & present8ion all coincide in balanced synchronicity w/o lacking in any of these given respects or in service as is typically found elsewhere.      The only thing that could have been better this time was our table top could have been cleaned a bit better, felt the Slightest bit sticky.  But being we had 2 sit further back/closer 2 the kitchen due 2 the influx, it was very busy & this guy runs most of this show on his own w/o any assistance from behind the scenes, it's not enough 2 warrant a less star deduction. Another enjoyable 5* experience w/ an added fan of their fare. He Loved it as much as my previous lunch d8 & I did! No surprise...     I 4got 2 check our itemized receipt (the green 1 they keep) 2 c if we were charged 4 refills, so will have 2 keep that in mind on my excursion 4 next time's outing there 2 report the findings on that topic. Perhaps it's an old practice they used 2 have when 1st opening that they've done away w/ (or @ least hope such is the case). It wouldn't b a complete deal~breaker because their  food, service & the dining experience is OUTSTANDING, but I wouldn't partake of any extra IF they do charge 4 them.

3rd Xs a charm, or perhaps not as much. I h8 2 have 2 deduct a star but what started off a a usually gr8 experience kinda ended on a sour note this time around when we went that particular wk~end. We arrived that Sat morning 2 start our day off w/ an early lunch b4 needing 2 run our usual valley~wide errands. Had 2 go 2 the bank 1st & got there about 7-10 min after they opened. Not sure they were tho as 1 side of their doors was locked but the right 1 wasn't & the sign hadn't been turned around 2 show 'Open' yet. No biggie, they got it shortly after we were seated. It was obvious the head super server guy wasn't there... or yet.     Everything started off gr8, we got the usual crispy rolls (a standard item each time we go), the Crispy Tofu & Papaya Salad this time 2 start . I wanted 2 try an avocado boba this time as it sounded interesting & I do like trying new things. Entrees = I chose the Tom Ka soup w/ Tofu & he went w/ the Spicy Basil fried rice. Everything was the usual Amazing in portions, deliciousness, & present8ion ~ NOTHING lacking in those respects & happy 2 c business picking up here as their quality & quantity of scrumptuously 1derful food items certainly Deserves it!!     Our w8tress started off gr8 but then disappeared after the place got busier & the head super server guy came in. I think she's usually a cook or something but wish she had given us our bill when I asked her last time we saw her b4 the disappearing act. We needed 2 get going & after 20 min or so w/ no sight of her anywhere I had 2 disturb the Head server who was already busy tending 2 multiple things simultaneously 2 ask 4 our bill.      My lunch d8 couldn't stand w8ing anymore so he went outside & kept gesturing 2 me thru the window (which humored me 4 the 1st 10 min or so) but then it was getting frustr8ing & we were running l8. I made the mistake of paying cash once Super server guy tracked down our bill from her, but there wasn't enough change in their drawer 2 break down a bill 4 tip. So we had 2 waste more time we didn't have 2 go around & get change from 2 different stores in the plaza cuz even if not gr8 service this time, we're not cheapsk8es or stiffers on tipping.      I still have a lot of Luv 4 this place & this won't deter us from frequenting here, but I really hope that next time the on~the~ball head Super~Server guy is there from the start cuz it's clearly evident He REALLY makes the difference & keeps most everything oper8ional, but yeah this is still a Defin8 Fave & will probably look 4 him b4 sitting down 4 future visits which is a Major compliment 4 all he does there!! Looking 4ward 2 next visit 2 this #1Derful establishment...

Our weekly excursion here had 2 instead b take~out this time as it was rather l8 & we were 2 pressed 4 time 2 dine in. So we called our order in lastnight 4 pick~up.      We got our stand~by crispy veggie rolls (a must~have item every time) in addition 2 Vegetable Tempura 4 our appetizers, along w/ Pad Snow Pea, w/ Crab Fried Rice & Pineapple Curry w/ shrimp & 2 Boba's (Taro & HoneyDew) 2 go. 1derfully friendly & helpful phone etiquette which felt almost as nice as being accomod8ed in~house.     Went 2 pick it up about 20 min l8r & everything was packed, & ready 2 go including napkins, plastic~ware & even some chopsticks 4 those who want 2 try the traditional way 4 a more cultural experience ~ Nice! He voluntarily accounted 4 everything that was ordered b4 payment & even assisted getting it out 2 the car (talk about above & beyond service esp 4 a take~out/pick~up order)! Rushed home, excited 2 b sampling more treasures 4 our palate.     True 2 what we've consistently known from the beginning, all we scurried home w/ didn't disappoint. Our household enjoyed everything so much, there was hardly any talking between scarfing each item & savoring both Boba's, which were Exceptional as usual. Couldn't decipher which 1 we liked better, personally I'm not 'usually' a huge fan of HoneyDew... till THIS Boba (which is saying A Lot) so suffice 2 say, I'll b getting this again future visits & it's WOW~ness is now up w/ our fave flavors, which is most of them (almost saliv8ing writing about it now)! Lol     The Veggie Rolls were Scrumptious as always & the Amazing Vegetable Tempura will now b joining the ranks along~side them as a staple 2 future visits/orders. This YUMMYness has battered broccoli, carrots, onions, green beans & pumpkin &  is such a complimentary blend of flavors, I'd eat an entree size portion (but alas, I know it's called appetizer 4 a reason).      They really loved their Crab Fried Rice which has real crab meat, eggs, onions, garlic & cilantro & wolfed down the Pineapple Curry Shrimp right after which has red curry paste w/ pineapple, shrimp, carrots & bell pepper in coconut milk. At 1 point they put some of both entrees 2gether, gladly inhaling it that way 2! My Pad Snow Pea=DELICIOUS w/ snow peas, water chestnuts, mushrooms, carrots & onions ~ ur choice of chicken, beef, pork or TOFU (the last of which, being what I had of course)! I esp Highly Recommend any of their Pad entrees, any1 who's had any vari8ion has raved about/talked about their taste~buds thanking them.     So what else can I say that I haven't several Xs b4? EXCEPTIONAL Flavorful Quality food (& Boba's) w/ Generous Portions, fresh nutritional ingredients w/ dishes customized how u want &/or need 4 ur dietary regimen in addition 2 Exemplary service (especially when the Awesome head Super~Server guy is there). What's not 2 like, or in our household's case LUV? The only thing there is 2 1der is, what's the soonest I'll get 2 come back again...
