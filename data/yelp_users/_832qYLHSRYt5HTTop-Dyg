I've been a AAA member for more years than I care to admit and never really used any services other than roadside assistance. I recently discovered that there are numerous third party businesses that can handle your vehicle title, registration, plates, and everything that the DMV can do.   This office is awesome. Walk in show them your membership card and they give you a pager, a few minutes later you're handling all of the business you need for your automobiles, travel, vacations, etc. I can only speak to the title, registration and tags piece, the office is great. The two young ladies that handle the DMV stuff are awesome and make long dreary tasks easy. Friendly, courteous, extremely helpful! Stop going to DMV, if you're an AAA member this is a total five star experience. Kudos to Saundra and LaTanya!

Traditional car wash. They have totally dropped the ball in trying to compete for the $3 Express wash. NO FREE VACUUMS unless you spend at least $12.99 for the lowest end car wash. If you want full service, you could give them a try. If you're looking for  something like Clean Freak, this isn't it. I wash my car every day and just need it clean and a place to vacuum and dry it. These guys are a buck short

I'm a NY style pizza guy, but Spinato's is awesome.  I get spinach, garlic  extra mozzarella and ricotta.... Close to a white pizza as I can get.  The quality is awesome and you can tell its family owned.  Pick it up hot and it'll be worth your while.  It actually rivals Ray's, which ideas close to NY style as you'll find in Scottsdale. Gonna have to try then Italian Beef sandwich. It's gotta kick butt over a place like Portillos.  When you're feeling indulgent and flush (it ain't cheap) hit up. Spinato's.

Awesome pizza. Chicago style....I'm a NY boy. So takes Some getting used to. And where I come from Calzone is filled with ricotta and mozzarella- here, not at all. White pizza doesn't exist. Takes getting used to but great staff and service. I wish people from Chicago could learn how to make pizza instead of just hot dogs....but it's definitely high quality once you get over your New York self.

We found these guys online and they offered to come out and give us a free, no-obligation estimate.  Their technician, Michael, was definitely on-time, took a quick look at the door, immediately knew what the problem was, and told me he could fix it in 15 minutes fr WAY less than I had planned for.   This company is GREAT.  The door was fixed, as promised in less than 15 minutes after he arrived, it works better than it did when it was new...I can literally open it with one finger, it slides so easily, and it was EASY to get done. I couldn't be happier-and recommend them HIGHLY if you have sliding glass door, screen or sunscreen issues.  Obviously, honest, reliable, clean, quick, timely, and the price was more than fair.

This is a great local moving company. Family owned, great prices, great service.  They moved both us and our neighbors in DC Ranch on the same day and did an awesome job.  Their people are friendly and careful---they actually offer a packing service (we didn't pack ANYTHING) and nothing was broken.  They even packed the food in the pantry and fridge.  We have a huge and valuable art collection which was extremely well taken care of.  Moved us to near Fountain Hills (the other side of the world for them) and then came and picked up all of the boxes, wardrobes and blankets.  If you're moving locally (ask them about out of town moves) they will be thousands less than any of the "major" moving companies.  And, by the way, they had to store our stuff for two weeks between the move out and move-in.  Again, everything showed up in perfect condition and their people worked diligently and carefully throughout.  A definite 5 star recommendation.

Excellent service. Ryan, the owner, is a former homebuilder, licensed and bonded.  I have called in emergency situations as well as for general handyman services....including, plumbing, electrical, indoor/outdoor lighting, and even curtain rod hanging.  I provide their name at the security gate, provide them with a code to my garage and they let themselves in, do all the work and leave an invoice.  I've even left a blank check behind for them to fill in as payment.  As reliable and as great a quality of work as you will ever get from a handyman/contracting service.

I was recommended o this cute little place by a friend who was born in Hawaii.  I'm a big fan of Loco Moco and plate lunches having hspent a ton of time in Hawaii. This place is clean and casual in a fast food kind of way, except they made my dish from scratch.  It was excellent Loco Moco and the real deal. Definitely check this place out for a taste of home or just a great taste of Hawaii

If zero stars were an option, this place would be a candidate. Absolutely the worst pizza at the most ridiculous prices ever. Cafeteria line, overheated, dry, cardboard pizza. Institutional, long lines at lunch time and NOT worth the time or effort. If you need a baseline for the worst pizza experience anywhere, one that makes Domino's or Pizza Hut taste like your favorite NY or Chicago neighborhood joint, try it. Otherwise, any frozen pizza in the grocery store is faster better and cheaper. Truly awful. And I'm trying to be objective and nice.

I was just there looking for new frames. It's an awesome, local, friendly shop, owner owned and operated. What a great selection of top notch designer frames at really fair prices. I got a fees pair of Ray-Bans and had a wonderful experience. Better than any of the big-box, national brand stores! Highly recommended

I drink a lot of coffee and appreciate a "local" non- chain experience. Kona 13 is near my house and just north of Shea on Frank Lloyd Wright in a little strip mall. I'd love to give them 5 stars- they seem to try really hard- they're friendly and pretty quick although the drive through isn't automated (neither is Dutch Bros, which is surprising) so you can't give them your order in advance, but they hustle when they get it and often have someone outside to get your order in advance.   Their coffee is KONA, certainly one of the best in the world, bit pricey. But they also have a wide selection of juices, smoothies and other specialties.  They're obviously not trying to be Starbucks which is good in a lot of ways. But I can't give them 5 stars because I don't understand their model. A "neighborhood" coffee shop is definitely missing in my part of town, but this is not a place to meet friends and hang out or get some work done and relax. They have a counter with a couple of seats. The first time I tried it, I went with my laptop and phone and thought I'd be able to sit at a table with a great cup of coffee, get to know the people working there and get a little work done in what looked like a hip little place. It IS a hip little place with a cute pseudo-Hawaiian theme. Alas, although it SEEMS like the space is big enough, there are NO TABLES, no wi-fi and apparently it's not in the plan...much like Dutch Brothers. Also, since I'm now at the drive thru daily, I asked about a punch card or loyalty program and its a little convoluted- it's some version of a prepaid card, which is ok, but I tend to lose punch cards. I haven't lost my Dutch Bros punch card and got a nice $6.00 freebie, but without a phone app, which I don't expect from a neighborhood joint, if I lose it, I've lost cash.  So if you live in Fountain Hills or drive down Shea to the 101, it's worth the detour and avoiding the crowds at Starbucks, but unfortunately, it's not the neighborjood hang-out in the traditional local coffee shop sense that you might prefer, as I do, but the coffee and espresso drinks, while not cheap, are excellent and of you're a drive thru type (which I often am) it's a great little find. With a couple of tweaks, like fixing the punch card program, it could easily be a 5 star and if they decide to pursue being a neighborhood hang out by adding indoor and outdoor tables, wi-fi  and a restroom, it could be better than 5 stars. I like it and recommend it as long as you know what youre getting and it's the kind of place you're looking for.

Good burgers. I don't drink beer. Why would anyone want a cold cheeseburger though? Shouldn't it be Cold Beers and Hot Cheeseburgers???

I spent years going to salons as a snob who thought that I needed a $50 haircut (plus tip) in an atmosphere where they served cappuccino.  My sister in law came to visit from Denver and went for a haircut- she came back looking awesome! So naturally I asked where she went and it was Floyd's. She told me it was a cool atmosphere and reasonably priced plus she got a great haircut.  So, I showed up as a walk-on and got assigned to a great woman named Jaime (pronounced Jayme). I briefly explained what I was hoping for in terms of style and she nailed it. Plus she is super cool and the atmosphere is very rock and roll/traditional barbershop including barber chairs the old fashioned shoulder massagers, shaves (haven't tried that yet) but also for women, color jobs, and full service salon stuff.  I've been going back regularly and make an appointment with Jaime in advance. Turns out a guy who cut my hair 20 years ago at a salon near my office works there too.  Don't walk-run to Floyd's next time you need a haircut, shampoo, beard trim, hot towel shave or whatever. Best haircut for the price that I would go to (I'm not going to Cost Cutters or Sport Clips) and I'm always happy and Jaime is the best. Costs me HALF of what I used to pay and I can always give a fairly generous tip (between $10-20 bucks!).  If you don't go, don't blame me! I just told you all you need to know.
