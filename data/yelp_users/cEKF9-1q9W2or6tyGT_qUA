Casino floor smells like Old Spice, 'nuff said. Have not experienced the rooms.

Pretty plain, nice presentation but lacks every place else.

Pretty weak, got the pork sandwich with chips, sad when the highlight if the meal is the pickle. Bread was ok, but the meat "pulled" pork was basically meat paste. Could put it in a tube and take to the moon with you!

2 Adobada, 1 Asada taco. Asada taco was very good and the Adobada were excellent. I would recommend if you are in the area. Have some other items on the menu that look worth the visit as well.

Stopped in for lunch after a handful of coworkers recommended it.  In a sea of Mexican options this one was on point!  I had the carnitas plate.  The portion was large, and the flavor was amazing.  Rice and beans that came on the plate were good accompaniments, and the chips and salsa was good, and spicy!    The owner, Brent, seems like a good guy who runs a tight ship.  They are moving locations soon so, check before you head over.  Last thing you want to do is get there and find they have already switched to the new spot.

Great way to start the morning or end the day. I got here about 5:30am just in time to head up and watch the sun rise. Takes about 30-45mins to summit at a moderate pace (depending on how often you stop to take in the scenery, and pictures.   Desert Foothills trailhead, Desert Foothills Parkway (north of Chandler Boulevard) and Seventh Street. It will be on the north side of Desert Foothills Parkway, approximately 1.5 miles west from Chandler Blvd. provides access to: Telegraph Pass trail and Desert Classic trail (see Desert Classic details). Telegraph Pass Trailhead is located at Desert Foothills Parkway (north of Chandler Boulevard) and Seventh Street. The first  1/2 mile of this trail is a textured concrete surface for easy walking. The trail then splits off to continue on to Telegraph Pass, or on to The Desert Classic Trail.  The remaining one mile of Telegraph Pass Trail ends at the Summit Road, and offers quick access to the National Trail and the Kiwanis Trail within the park upon reaching the roadway. The Desert Classic Trail continues on for about 9 miles through the foothills on the south side of South Mountain and terminates at the south ramada area in Pima Canyon. Distance:  1.5 miles to Telegraph Pass, the saddle in the summit road (approximately 3.5 miles up on road).
