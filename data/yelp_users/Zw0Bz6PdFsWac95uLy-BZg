The staff is friendly and attentive. Too bad the food is so limited and not too impressive. There's some good items, but there's better places not to far for the same price point.

Thank you, Skeptical Chymist of Scottsdale, for ruining our wedding reception. I've been in the service industry for long enough to know that this was a disaster. The food was fine, the waitress we had was great, but the GM was a terror. He has been ambiguous about the event details the entire time I've been planning. I had given him a card number for payment months in advance. He did not run the card, even after I asked him about not running the card. Contrary to the contract I signed, I was charged for the entire amount of the bill all at once. My debit card said 'oh hell no' to the massive charge and when we tried to work out something with the GM we were yelled at and basically held hostage under threat of prosecution until we could get my Dad to come bail us out. Our poor server was so upset, my Dad said she was in tears over it. What should have been a special day for us was a nightmare.

This was a very nice surprise. I usually don't have much faith in chinese delivery, but my husband really wanted it. I got the Thai chilli shrimp and he got the orange chicken. They made the shrimp and broccoli without sauce for my four year old son (which he gobbled down). I didn't care for the fried rice that came with my combo, but the rest of it was delicious. If you're a spicy food fan you might want to get out your sriracha, as the spice level is a bit tame.       It was also delivered quicker than we expected and everyone was very friendly. I can be a bit awkward on the phone, but the woman who took my order was very nice and patient. The guy who brought it was also very nice.      We will absolutely be getting delivery from these guys again.
