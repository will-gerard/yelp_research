Overall its a great environment. The ambiance reminds you of a cabin atmosphere and the drinking hole is were all the entertainment happens. Bartenders are friendly and the menu is nothing to sleep on. If either looking for some cold beers or good food this is definitely a spot you come to on this side of phoenix. Evenings are a cult following of industry workers from the restaurants and bars around the area good music and great lighting.

Everything about this place speak to me as a local neighborhood bar with defined taste. As a random dweller of bars/pubs i always enjoy the setting of this venue it blends in the neighborhood perfectly with its own charm. As a big plus theres an ice cream shop connecting to the restaurant bar. Definitely recommend to other friends when in town.

Way More accessible than some of the restaurants near the area

At the bar with the Bartender Amy was one of the best experienced at the downtown/city scape area. The happy hour and sushi selection was all top shelf.  Definitely ask for the spicy mayo and sirachia if you want the rolls with a little extra spice
