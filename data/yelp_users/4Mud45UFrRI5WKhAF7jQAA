I have switched naturopathic doctors several times as they were not able to diagnose my issues.  Dr. K assumed I had hormonal imbalances.  After prescribing a simple blood test, Dr. K was able to determine I had several hormonal and vitamin deficiencies.  He started me on IV vitamins and minerals, and sent me home with natural supplements and a prescription for hormones.   I felt much better after the IV, but within a few weeks of consistent vitamin treatment and hormone replacement therapy, I feel normal again.  I now sleep better and have much higher energy levels.  After going through sleep doctors, endocrinologists, and several other MD's and naturopathic doctors. I finally found a doctor I can honestly say knows what he is doing.

I sat at the bar and waited for the rest of my party to arrive.  Even though the place wasn't very busy it took the bartender at least 15 minutes to ask if I needed anything.   I guess being the only one sitting at the bar and making eye contact isn't enough anymore.  After being seated I ordered the Tanzy Salad, which for being named after the restaurant should be showcase the chefs cuisine.  I also requested a side of chicken for a bit more protein.  The salad and dressing were blah and boring and the chicken breast was dry.  If I am in the area again and wanting to have Mediterranean food I am going to NORTH, where the restaurant isn't as glamorous, but the food is excellent.  I would reserve this place for cocktails only.
