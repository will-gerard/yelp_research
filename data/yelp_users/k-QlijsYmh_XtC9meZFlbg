The food was poor. We had few different things off the menu . The anti pasta was really bad . Old carrots and bag lettuce.

Yummy!! The service and food were fantastic. There Happy hour is until 7 which works great for those of us who work til 6. We had a couple of items off the HH Menu. The steak quesadilla is delicious.
