It's so sad to see this place going down the hole.  I have very fond childhood memories getting ice cream and riding the merry go round.  This last time might have been the last time. It was dirty, the staff is a whole other story, the place looked like it needed some serious TLC.  Note to whoever is the owner or in management, don't let an awesome nostalgic place like this fall due to you and your staffs laziness.

My boyfriend decided that he wanted to have his 22nd birthday dinner at Bj's, it made sense because we were going to Dave and Busters afterwards. I called about four days in advance to make a reservation for 15 people at 8:15pm. I spoke with a manager and everything was worked out. We arrived a little early, around 8, and were told that our reservation had been changed to 8:30. This was unbeknownst to me which was irritating because they had my number on file and I had 15 hungry people showing up expecting to be seated at 8:15.  Well, unfortunately this was just the start of things! We didn't ACTUALLY sit down at 8:30, we didn't even get seated at 9! We sat down to eat dinner around 9:15, PERFECT! By this point most of us were tired and mostly just wanted to go home. Personally I didn't even care about the fact that I was hungry anymore. So they assigned two servers to our table because we were such a large party which made me happy, I thought that would mean better service oh boy was I wrong! Our drinks took 20 minutes to come out, seriously? So we all put our order in and instead of entering all of our orders AT ONE TIME in the computer our servers entered them at randomly different times so all of our food came out randomly. Now let me add that everyone in this party has either served or worked in the restaurant industry before and we all know that when there's two of you, bringing 15 people drinks and appetizers should NEVER take 20-30 minutes. Now as far as the food goes, EH. Mediocre at best. The Long Islands were ten dollars and they tasted like shit. I had a five dollar Mai Tai and it was probably the most delicious thing I had all night! The ONLY thing I can give them credit for is their spinach artichoke dip, that was heavenly.  Now we had all planned on leaving Bj's around 10:30 because Dave and Busters closes at one on Fridays. We didn't even get our checks until 11. SHOCKING. So we didn't end up walking out the front doors until 11:30. I was furious to say the least.  All in all, I would NEVER EVER EVER reccomend this place to ANYONE or EVER come back here again.

Four peaks French toast is the best, and of course I love the whole staff and the managers!

The menu is awesome, and our server was great! There was 2 of us and we were sat on a Sunday morning within 10 minutes.

I so badly want to rate this place highly because the food is incredible. But unfortunately the service was so terrible that the food is not worth coming back for horrible service.

It was my first time here and I am usually pretty faithful to the nail salon right next to my old house. The did a great job the only downfall was he cut my toe, which didn't feel too awesome.

Terrible. At least what I had was. Don't get the orange beef it's literally all fat. My boyfriend also said his hot garlic beef and hot and sour soup were awful. Maybe we just need to try something else on the menu but I'm very hesitant to return.

This place has never disappointed! The food is always delicious and consistent and the wait times are minimal to none. This last time our service from Rachel was awesome, she suggested adding granola to the blueberry pancakes and they were incredible! I'd recommend the food to anyone and definitely ask for Rachel!

This is regarding the juice bar..get some people that want to work there. Cold pressed juice is only good for up to 72 hours when you bottle and seal it, not in a togo cup with a lid and straw. So when I ask for fresh juice, I expect something other than "everything we have is over there."   Come to find out "everything" was juiced on a Monday..I went on a Thursday. To say the least I won't be coming back and I would never recommend you guys.

Oh my god this place sucks, my boyfriend and I sat there and boo'd about how lame it was. The staff is rude, with no sense of humor. I mean my god I serve tables and I promise it's not that bad.  This location has been about 5 different bars in the past 10 years, no one can seem to stay. It's a shame because the building is huge and has a loft area with a patio. Oh well!
