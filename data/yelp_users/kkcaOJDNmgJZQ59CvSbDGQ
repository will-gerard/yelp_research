My 4 year old daughter insisted that she neeeeeded her ears pierced to go on living another day, so off to Claire's we went. I am a "for real adult" and can't recall the last time I had cause to go into Claire's though I am certain it was back when neon and leg warmers were the shiz. (The first time). The two girls working were standing at the door gabbing with a boy from another store so I was put off at first. Once I flagged one down, it went better. She offered the option of waiting 20 min so my daughter could get both ears done at once instead of one at a time, but my girl wasn't having that. I was at first leery about letting a girl most likely in High school puncture my sweet girl's ears, but I was pleasantly surprised. The employee who did her piercing was friendly and thorough. I was pleased with her professionalism and my daughter is beyond thrilled with her fancy new ears. I would recommend Claire's for ear piercing.

I'm not a huge walmart fan as it goes but I have found this store to be in consistently good condition, very clean and well stocked. However I recently had a very poor experience with their customer service department and I was extremely disappointed in how rude and short they were with me. This experience left such a negative impression on me, I do not think I will be back.

This 5 start review belongs to the absolutely fantastic bar at Tommy Bahama staffed tonight by the fabulous bartender Carl with a C. Happy hour here is like a mini vacation. Love the drinks, and the appetizers. What really made our night was Carl and his delectable tropical drinks. Another wonderful night at Tommy Bahama, I already can't wait to come back!

I came home from a week long trip to realize my house keys didn't make it home with me. After a few necessary obscenities I fired up my trusty yelp and located a locksmith. I called and Levi answered promptly, and told me he could be at my house in 20 min. (Cue angels singing). He showed up as promised and got me back in to my house fast. After a long day of travel it was so nice to be able to get in so quickly and Levi was so friendly it took the pain out of my mistake. I will definitely be using him again, and recommending him to my friends.

Stopped in for lunch today because several of my favorite Italian beef experts were raving about it. I did not check the reviews ahead of time (shameful) so I was unaware of this mystical fry sauce of which people are speaking. (Fail) I've acknowledged my defeat, let's move on. Today we tried the Italian beef, sausage sandwich, cheeseburger and chili. Let me say, it is the Italian beef you are going for my friends. You may not know it yet, but you will. All the menu items we tried were great (except the chili, skip it) but the Italian beef is the very most most delicious. You do need fast hands or a bib because this thing will be everywhere but it's worth every messy bite. I got the hot peppers and they added the perfect kick to my sandwich. I needed a bird bath when I was done, but I had a happy tummy!

Oh CB&C I hate to do this to you, but I'm afraid you earned it. And it's not about the food. I am a regular visitor to this place probably coming 2 to 3 times a month to have the buffalo chicken dip, which I highly enjoy with a side of ranch. Last night we popped in at 9pm after a movie. Closing time was 10. Sat at the bar to grab a bite, but we couldn't even get the bartender's attention for a menu. I mean all the way down to shouting "excuse me, excuse me". Here's the catch, the bar was not busy, there were perhaps 5 patrons there. The guy tending bar was far more concerned with closing out for the night and talking football with some other customers to even look our way. A waitress did finally get his attention for us, and we ordered beer and asked for menus. You know what? After several minutes still no beer and the bartender was back to closing out his register. At that point we decided to leave. There is no need to beg for service and too many places to grab a meal to be ignored. CB&C, I hope you read your yelp reviews and fix this soon. I like your location, I like your food, but if I can't even order it, you've got a problem.

I would not even consider buying a car from anyone but Dean Trostle. He is by far the most honest and forthcoming guy in the business. I have had the opportunity to work with Dean on several transactions and he's always taken excellent care of myself and my vehicle. Their service department is top notch and always works to make any vehicle issues right. As a single mom is brings me tremendous piece of mind to know that I can trust Dean and his staff to treat me honestly and fairly.   I recently read an erroneous review on here from a source who was not even a customer of precision fleet and it shouldn't be allowed. Had that reviewer met Dean even once, they would see how far off their assessment of him is. Furthermore, I was so offended by this review I asked Dean about it personally when I was in for service, and he mentioned to me how false it was. Don't be swayed by negative trouble makers, go in and visit the folks at Precision Fleet and decide for yourself.

Go! Eat here! Do it! If you are reading this review and currently considering stopping into this fine establishment, start driving. We had an outstanding experience. Let me first complement the staff, they are so friendly and helpful, one guy even came over to chat for a few min and told us a little about the place. His enthusiasm for his job and the restaurant was refreshing. Now let's talk tacos...delicious, wonderful, fresh, flavorful, perfection! We had the mahi and the steak. Both were fantastic. I was so delighted with how fresh the fish tasted. In a land locked state, you know fish can be a risk. Not here. Just awesome. They pack so much flavor into each taco, it will make your taste buds sing. It's very casual, the atmosphere is bright and clean, I only wish they were open a little later. Thanks for the great experience, I will definitely be back!

When I go to a large chain establishment, I usually expect the food to be sub par and the service to be ok but not great. This afternoon Buffalo Wild Wings took it to a new low. Barely dressed wings, cold food, a waitress who was MIA. It doesn't surprise me that this place is pretty dead. I can't imagine I would go back, I'd rather use my calories and money elsewhere.

What I love most about this place is the owners commitment to truly awesome flavors. I had a coffee flavor I was so so on, and I kid you not, he didn't rest until it was the absolute best coffee custard I had ever had. You can not get that just anywhere! Love the flavors here, Banana is an all time favorite for me. My primary addiction at Glen's is the Cherry/blueberry slushie with custard. It's pure sugary, heavenly goodness.     At Glen's they are generous with the samples, don't be afraid to try them until you find the one that makes your heart sing. They've got it, I'm telling you. Go for the friendly staff and the cheery decor, stay because it's delicious. You'll be back when your taste buds insist on a custard fix that only Glen's in Tempe can satisfy.

Boo, hiss, not a fan at all. In fact, I want to save you and tell you to skip it. I am offering two stars because my teenage son did like the hotdog. My burger was greasy and disgusting, the fries were way over cooked, the shake was ok. The employees seemed disinterested in anything going on. I like the decor and the location but really, it's extremely expensive and not even almost as good as In and Out Burger and I don't even really like In and Out. I know this is staple from somewhere and the people of Phoenix were happy it came to town, but I gotta say, I'm not sure how long they can last. Too many good choices in that area to eat there.
