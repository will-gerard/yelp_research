They have the best east coast style breakfast sandwich, you just have to order it with a fried egg instead of scrambled.

One of the best authentic Italian food places in the area that I have found!  Everything is fresh and made from scratch.  It's hidden in the corner of a Safeway shopping center I would never think to go in for Italian food but now I'm just mad I have lived in the area for 10 years and just found this place about a year ago.

Zero Stars.... I booked 2 back to back foursomes for friends that were in town over the weekend a few weeks in advance then the day we were booked to play it was pouring rain so I called to ask if it was even an option to cancel the two tee times.  The woman who answered the phone said normally no, but with the wind and rain they would allow cancellations but to call back once we confirmed we would not be able to make it so they could give the two foursomes away to any. I called back about an hour before when the tee times once everyone had found other things to do to notify them we would not be attending and that's when I got the surprise of their GM telling me the tee times were non-refundable and I would be charging me the full amount on the credit card I used to reserve the tee times.  When I told him what the girl had told me earlier in the day he said she didn't have the authority to make that decision and once the tee time arrived they would charge my credit card the full amount, which they did.  I now have a claim in to Visa who will handle it from here....  I'm not really surprised by any of this though I have played their several times before and the service is always awful with some of the angriest marshal's anywhere in Arizona who will drive and follow you for several holes then ask you to hurry even when you are right on the group in front of you.  The previous times I have played the course it is usually in pretty good condition, but overall is a very flat course with no real elevation changes or even mounds in the fairways so it is not one of my favorites and I don't think I will be missing out on anything if I never play here again.

I live right around the corner and this has become one of the regular lunch/dinner choices for us, especially during football season.  It's a great place to come with friends or family to eat and watch a game or play shuffleboard or just sit at the bar and grab a quick dinner. Golden hot wings are my favorite but they also have a great BLT on sourdough...

Food and service are both amazing! The quality is always consistently great. Whenever I'm in the area around lunchtime I can't help but stop in, but be sure to be early because it gets packed around noon. My favorite is the Brat with peppers and onions

They are a great company!  Really easy to work with with very reasonable pricing.   When we renovated my home we used them to provide and install a new split system unit and run new ductwork which they did without any issues or any hidden costs.  Then a few years later the other unit on our home (which was 20+ years old) stopped working, they came and installed a new unit that was perfect for about a year and half when it just wasn't cooling as well as it previously did.  After a short phone call they got a tech scheduled still under warranty to get the unit running perfectly again.

They have a great lunch special with a pork chop and pad thai, the food is always consistently good and they do a good job of making it anywhere from Thai Hot to no spice at all depending on what you are looking for.
