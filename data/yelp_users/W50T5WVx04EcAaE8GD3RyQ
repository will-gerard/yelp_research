I didn't go here at first because of all the negative reviews, so I went to C2 tactical in Tempe.  BIG mistake!!!  C2 is awful.  After my poor experience there, I did go to Caswells.  I took my girlfriend whom has never shot before.  When we approached the counter, the staff helped her pick out a gun that she felt comfortable with.  We were shooting for about 20 minutes when a staff member came out and said, "it's kind of slow, if you guys want a free lesson..."  While I am an experienced shooter, I am not an instructor.  His 15 minutes with her not only improved her shot, but in my opinion, made her feel more comfortable with the weapon."  I will be going back this weekend with a few friends.  Caswells is definitely a friendly environment and in my opinion, very much recommended.

I love this place; great food and atmosphere, I however have maybe been there thirty times and have yet had good service.

I go here on the weekends or after 5pm, and the Chandler location for lunch on the weekdays.  Every time the marinara blows me away; you can taste every ingredient in the sauce.  Every dish is the same, a true example of fresh ingredients.

Placed a $90 order for 9 people. Got home and two meals were missing. Called back and let them know what was missing. Showed up and they hadn't made it but instead argued with us about it then charged us for their mistake. Asked for a discount and they spoke back and forth in front of us in Spanish for about 30 seconds and then replied, "we don't give discounts." Very rude and disrespectful about the whole situation. Clearly Cafe Rio doesn't have customer service training.  Will never return and will never recommend.

I brought my long-haired cat here after she was experiencing some diarrhea.  The visit was great, on-time, and I was out with meds within an hour.  During the visit, the Vet Tech told me, that if she ever gets poo in the fur on her backside, that I can come in and they would clean it up for $10 or $15.  A few months later I called to schedule this and the girl that answered the phone said, in a rude and condescending tone, "we don't do that."   I asked how much it would cost to do this, and she said I would have to pay for a full visit, $60.  Strike 1.    A few months later the cat was very stressed due to a change in living conditions (I got a dog).  I called VCA to see if I could get some meds to relax her and make an appt for the dog to get a general check up.  I swear I got the same girl that answered the phone.  She was quite rude, and said that for the cat, I would have to pay for a visit, however this time it was $79. I asked if there was a new pet discount (there was for the cat) and didn't get an explanation, I got a "No."  Fine, I'll explore other vets then. For the cat though, putting a cat into a carrier and transporting it is very stressful.  To get meds to calm a cat down that is already stressed out, I simply don't get this, however I do understand that you can't treat and see an animal before giving meds/script. Essentially I have had 3 experiences with this vet.  The Vet herself is great, the Vet techs too.  The receptionist though, this place clearly needs to work on their communication efforts.

I am very particular about where I go for sushi.  I can name ten places I will not go to, and have struggled to find a place to frequent; until now.  I have only been here about 5 times, but every time was a great experience.  Great food, staff, prices,and atmosphere.

NO. Jeff Mattingly visited my home and spent about an hour with me talking over the details of the job I wanted done. He told me he would email a quote within the next day or two.  The next day he called me and said that he wanted to get some more specifics.  After 2 hours of conversation, he decided that he wanted to come back the next day.  I agreed and planned on that.  As the evening aged to around 4-5 pm, I called him and the call was rejected. The next morning I called the office and they said they would call me back.  They did, and let me know the general manager would call be back in about an hour.  That was 3 days ago.

Buffalo wild wings to me is like RA. Great atmosphere and service, but crappy food. I ordered twelve hot wings and a beer. We'll get to the beer in a minute. The wings were super greasy, like soaked in cooking oil. They were more sweet than hot, they tasted like they were dipped in sugar. The ranch was mayo with seasoning, and even had the same consistency as such. It was overall gross. I asked the difference in cost between a bud lite and a kiltlifter. The guy said, bud is $3 four a tall, and $4 for a kilt, as I began to order a kilt he verbally changed the price to $5.50. I will not return.

This place is fast and cheap. I will definitely return. Four stars because they missed a few spots and I had to go home and touch up.

This place is so shady. I was there for three hours, worked with management, and spent over $400.  I was told that I had to switch my plan during my upgrade from unlimited data to limited.  While this is true, the manager told me that I use 5-6 gig/month, so I went with the plan he suggested.  Later after speaking with customer service on the phone, she told me that I have never gone over 2 gig and adjusted my plan accordingly.  The sleazeball at the store further disclosed multiple hidden fees at the register, rather than being honest from the beginning.     I am seriously questioning leaving Verizon after 12 years due to this experience.

Tiny, filthy, has large gaps under parts of the fence so small dogs can get out. The water fountain was leaking when I was there so there was a large muddle puddle.

I will NEVER go back to this range.  If you don't want to read my lengthy complaints, read this: Go to Caswells off the 60 in Mesa.    Some background, I am an experienced shooter (14 years) and a decorated Navy sharp shooter.   I like going to the desert to shoot because in my experience, staff at ranges and usually arrogant dicks.  C2 did more than exceed my expectations.    Before I walked in, I read their signs to be sure I was meeting their rules walking in open carry.  My firearm was clear, though within seconds of walking in, I was approached by a staff member, "before you walk in, will you be sure a round isn't chambered?"  First, I did this.  Second, how does he know I didn't do this because he asked me to clear before I walked in.  I will never unholster my weapon in public unless I intend to fire, and if he wanted me to clear when I walked in, he could have asked me politely when I entered.  I apologized, for whatever I did that wasn't as expected and went about my business.    When I got to my lane, the range officer noted that the target retrieval device wasn't working properly and moved my to a different lane.  I was all ready to shoot, so before I moved, I dropped my clip,cleared my weapon, moved the ammo over to the lane and then came back for the gun.  When I did that, the range office said, "you were supposed to holster your weapon."  I was somewhat confused, so simply apologized and he further said, "I just told you that." I was wearing two sets of hearing protection and whatever this guy muttered to me, was clearly missed.  He was very rude about it after my apology for missing that, when I clearly made an effort to be safe my moving the loaded clip in a separate trip from the empty and cleared gun.  I popped off two boxes of ammo, and thought about buying another 50 rounds, so I asked him, "how much do you sell ammo for?"  Instead of, "what size?" or "what are you looking for?"  The jerk in the most annoyed and matter-of-fact tone of speaking said, "that depends on what caliber."  After my purchase I was getting ready to go, my personal items were on a bench behind me and I again made sure the range officer was to see I moved my empty clips separately from the gun to the bench behind me.  As I did so, he straight yelled at me, "anytime you are back here you have to holster your weapon."  I was confused because I thought he meant 'back here' as back at the lanes, from the store, and you cant fire a weapon in the holster... I then figure out we was referring to back here as behind the yellow line.  When I asked for clarification, he thought I was being smart with him and spat more attitude at me.    Essentially, This was my first and last experience at this range.  I feel that I was targeted as I saw multiple safety violations for other patrons, though this guy for some reason wanted to hold me accountable for all of the unknown (published or spoken) rules of their range.    Go to Caswells off the 60 in Mesa.
