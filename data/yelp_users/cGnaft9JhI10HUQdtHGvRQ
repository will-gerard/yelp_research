What a wonderful place to visit. Especially at night during the holidays. This past holiday season the Chihuly exhibit was magical. Treat yourself and go.

This is a wonderful place to go for HH and watch the sun set on their patio,. Their appetizers are half price as are their wines until 6:00. The service is wonderful and the ambiance is absolutely beautiful. They also have entertainment around 7:00. I had their margarita pizza and it was good. it was $5.00 and almost too big for 2 people to share. The white wines are very good. $4-$5.00 a glass during HH.

I worked closely with Paul to help me find a replacement door for my fireplace. He went above and beyond to help me. I was very impressed with the store. It is clean with lots of impressive fireplaces. I especially liked their gas fireplace wood logs. They looked so real.  Everyone from the phone receptionist to Kent at the front desk provided the best customer service.

Tried this restaurant with a groupon. Probably would not have, if I didn't have the coupon. Don't let the storefront and decor stop you from going in. The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly. And the food, WOW!  We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate. The portions were very generous. I ordered the fruit drink. Everything was absolutely delicious. One of my new favorite restaurants . Will definitely be back.

Goldie's has very good food. Can't say I ever had a bad meal. However, if you are looking for a beer and munchies, hands down they have the best nachos and wings. Great prices on beers during HH. Margaritas, wines are just okay.

I was not sure I would enjoy an adult puppet show but I have to say the evening was a blast. The skits were laugh out loud funny. The building is an historic Morman Church. Very cool. You can enjoy an adult beverage, a glass of wine or beer as you watch the puppet show. Treat yourself to this venue.

Seriously, Woohoo! As good as it gets. The world would be a better place if all the stores treated their customers the way they do at Bob's Bike shop. Dale is absolutely awesome.

The pizza is okay. Have had better in Detroit. Their mozzarella, and tomato salads (caprese) are to die for. The atmosphere is really cool. Staff is friendly. However, very crowded and parking can be tricky.

OMG their mushroom burritos are the absolute best. I have to request it as they took it off their menu. They will still prepare it if asked. The guacamole is fantastic. The ambiance is very cool. The wait time to get in can be long but worth it.

OMG their coffee is so good. I like the eclectic look and feel of the place. The lines are long but move quickly. Can be difficult to find a place to sit though. And parking can be a challenge.

Does Last Chance need another review? Yes. This store used to be my all time FAVORITE store. I got some of the best buys on designer jewelry, clothing, shoes, towels, glassware, make up........ This store used to carry all the Nordstrom online returns. and many of the returns from Nordstrom's. Now those returns, if they are not damaged are going to the RACK. Last Chance is getting all the damaged goods. And boy are those goods damaged:( And the prices have gone up. VINCE dresses used to sell for $19.97. Now they sell for $49.97 and they have holes and/or stains. I saw a pair of designer shoes for $99.97. They forgot to take the RACK clearance sticker ($39.99) off. Brought it to the attention of an employee and she said that's our store's selling price for designer shoes. Last Chance also does not run weekly specials like they were famous for.  You may still find that needle in a haystack bargain, but you probably have a better chance being struck by lightening.

Has gone completely downhill. Used to be an awesome, fun place to shop for high end bargains. Their prices have gone up and the quality is horrendous. Torn, stained, used, worn, shrunken clothing. To find a "new" high end brand would be a minor miracle. A lot of merchandise for sale I would not even give to Goodwill.

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Tried to return a fountain pump that came with a 3 year warranty. The general manager gave me every excuse as to why they would not honor the warranty even though I was well within the time frame. The general manager, (owner's son) then offered to give me 40% off another pump. The owner ,who was standing behind him said he was unwilling to do even that. He told me to take my fountain and leave. The owner is a very angry man with NO customer service skills at all. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.

In response to Andre L's comment, if the pump was in good working order I would never have brought it back. And for the sake of argument, even if it was working perfectly, it does not excuse the owner's "unprovoked" loud, mean spirited, angry words to me. He actually told  me to leave his store and take my pump with me. He would not even listen to me when I tried to explain what was wrong with the pump. I went to ACE hardware afterward and the man at ACE showed me what was wrong with the pump and why I was not getting enough pressure, and sold me the inexpensive part to fix it. I bought the fountain from Green Goodess and the pump. Just BEWARE if you have any problems with your purchase afterwards. My one star sticks.

As a flight attendant, I have been to many Jimmy John's and this one is not up to par. I ordered the gourmet Veggie sandwich. The bread was great. The insides were anything but gourmet. The gal making the sandwich was very frugal when putting veggies on my sandwich. Plus they were not as fresh as I would have liked. And the avocado spread, I thought she had forgot to put it on, but I did find a faint trace of spread in between the cheese slices. Will not visit this Jimmy John's again.

Met a friend for dinner and drinks. Ambiance is wonderful. Good drinks. Absolutely horrible food that was very expensive, adding insult to injury. I ordered the halibut. The portion was thin, and about the size of the palm of my petite hand and very salty and dry. There was a very small serving of veggies. The cost of the dinner was $28.00.  My friend got the Lobster Pasta. A very small, overcooked serving for $25.00. Terribly disappointing! Would only return for HH.

Love this place. Indoor or outdoor seating. The food is wonderful. Have not had a bad meal there. My favorite is their black bean burger and side salad. So yummy. Their sliders are also delicious. They have nice wines and are generous with the pours.

Big J is awesome. Not only is he a great plumber, he is a great guy with a good sense of humor. I had a leak in my bathroom. Of course it was Sunday and a holiday. He had his family in town. He came out and replaced a hose and did a few other things, He charged me his usual rate of $69.00 an hour. I highly recommend Big J.

This is a wonderful little restaurant. Love the ambiance. I have had their tuna sandwich and the beef. Both very delicious. Their cookies are great! Staff is friendly. The bartender however, is not very generous when he pours the wine.  They have their own parking lot.

5 stars for the ambiance and decor. Friendly staff. The food not so many stars. Had the veggie burger. It looked and tasted like it came from the frozen section at Costco. Two small slices of avocado and one small tomato slice. Onions and lettuce were a good portion. No choice of bun. Just a bland white bread. The Coleslaw was tasteless. Ordered a glass of white wine and it was a very small pour. Very disappointed. My friend ordered the chicken salad and she said her salad was just okay.
