After everyone's "connection" to a mechanic failed me, I turned to my trusty friend Yelp.  My car's check engine light was on and needed to pass emissions.  Tempe Auto was fast, professional, and honest. I had taken the car to another shop and they said it would take a few days to fix- these guys had it done in a few hours.  They said they work with lots of students/ out of state parents.  (Luckily my dad was in town at the time...and I'm not even a student anymore. I am, however, a spoiled brat.)    I recommended the shop to a friend who had a mystery issue with his car.  They ran diagnostics/checked it out and didn't find anything wrong.  They didn't charge him anything.    Check em out!

The service here is laughably bad. After 3 times having consistently bad service, I don't think I'll be back. The sushi at this location is very hit or miss and the edemame is usually falling apart. I just don't think it's that hard to fake a good attitude and give good service. I guess it's my fault for giving it so many chances.

Who doesn't love Four Peaks? This is the ultimate place to meet up with friends- for drinks, dinner, or both! I am obsessed with their chicken fingers- I find it hard to stray from that. I order them almost every time. I've tried their wings & pizza too- good! I even had a really delicious ice cream cake for dessert once. I'm not really a beer person but it is cool that they have their own brewery. So if you ARE a beer person, I'm guessing this is a good spot. Haha I love the atmosphere of the Tempe location- always lively & fun.

Here's the short version:  Pita Jungle's Food=AWESOME Pita Jungle Tempe's Service=HORRID....but worth it for the food.  Here's the long version:  The food is so fresh, and the rotating specials are awesome.  The cilantro jalepeno hummus is the BOMB, I love all the pizzas, and the lavosh wraps are so yummy! When ever someone is visiting- I bring them here!  The funny thing about pita jungle's tempe location is that 90% of the servers pretty much provide the opposite of customer service. They are all super edgy and have probably heard of every band ever way before they were on itunes. I'm pretty sure having piercings and obscure/ironic tshirts are madatory for hire. For instance- one time I was there for lunch and a waitress was holding a tray of cups of water. Some one bumped into her and they all came crashing down. Another server who was standing right next to her, looked, smirked, and went back to doing what ever pita jungle employees do.   Ask for the cherry lemonade- not on the menu but it will change your life.

I love D'lish- my favorite things are the breakfast buzz and the breakfast quinoa. My only complaint is the drive thru at this location. It's enough to make me need to call in an emergency bottle of Xanax. It's super narrow and people are always trying to squeeze through. Maybe I'm a hyper freak but it was terrifying. This is also the reason that I've never dined in at this location- wasn't sure if I could risk my life even though the breakfast buzz is so unbelievably good.

Love this Gilbert gem! My parents recently moved close by and this has been our go to spot for pizza nights. The do pizza by the slice (mostly around lunch) AND if you dine in, they give you complimentary garlic knots! Our favorites are the chicken pesto pizza and the baked ziti pizza. One or two slices & you're stuffed! The service was friendly and the place is always hopping. You can tell its family owned. Order on Wednesdays- they usually have a good deal!

This is what my mom said when we brought her here, "I have to be honest, when we pulled up I thought 'W-T-F,' but now I'm mad you've never brought me here before!"  My favorite things are the Date Shakes and the seared ahi tuna sandwich. Everything here is so fresh- the produce, the atmosphere, the decor. I love that they use produce from their backyard! There are always rotating specials too.  This is something else I appreciate about the staff- they always offer HELPFUL advice. I feel like they're honest and sincere with their suggestions and have not steered me wrong yet!

The two words I would use to describe the food at True Food Kitchen would be FRESH and FLAVORFUL! I probably will never be able to enjoy a vegetable from Safeway again after the amazing produce from True Food!   I don't even especially like veggies and the crudite plate was amazing.  I could go on and on about every dish, dessert, and drink that we ordered.  The staff was incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable.    The ambiance, service, and food make it a great place for a fun lunch with girl friends or a lunch meeting.

So my parents finally kicked me off of their policy and I had to start my own. This was a little scary- I've never done insurance-y things before! This office has been PHENOMINAL! They are constantly figuring out ways to get me better deals while maintaining excellent coverage. They have never made me feel stupid or uncomfortable. I really appreciate that! On top of it all, I got a bomb swag bag when I left the first time! Highly recommend!

We went to Tia Rosa's because my dad was in town and it's close to my sister's apartment. The patio looked inviting, but the whole experience was lack luster. We were seated on the back patio which was really pleasant, but this meant we were one of our servers few tables outside. Because of this, we rarely saw our server. The other tables outside were annoyed too. The table next to us actually got up to go find her so they could leave.   I asked her if there was a signature margarita....she didn't really have an answer. My dad asked about the sangria and her response was, "I've never had it." She was nice but didn't sparkle.  The chips and salsa were blah. The guacamole was pre made or from the grocery store...definitely not fresh. The red salsa tasted like the kind in the jar.  I'm surprised to read that people didn't like the meat- that was the only part we did like! It was flavorful and tender.   The manager brought out our food and our server hadn't cleared our appetizer plates. He began to clear the table and he grabbed my tortilla for my fajitas. Like his whole thumb went into my tortilla....and he did the same thing to my dad's tortillas. Gross. He thought it was funny. He also couldn't figure out how to turn on the heater and tried like 4 of them to the point of being awkward.  Basically, there are better Mexican restaurants in the valley. Skip this one.

iPic can be described in one word: LUXURIOUS! Even the bathrooms go above and beyond!   We sat in the Premium Plus seats, complete with blankets, pillows and reclining chair. The second I sat down i said, "Why would you ever see a movie any other way?" (Well probably you would if your dad didn't happen to buy you tickets and a gift card....such as myself)  My sister and I split the brie panini and the lemon chicken satay. Both were delicious! My other sister ordered one of the trios of sliders and loved that too! We also ordered sweet potato fries to split for the 3 of us- there were plenty. For dessert, we did the brownie (huge! delish!) and the creme brulee cheesecake (YUM!). I was stuffed and satified by the end.   I thought the service was great, but my sisters said they had had better in the past. It would be great for a special date, birthday, or even a bachelorette party. The bar looked like a great place to meet up with friends. Expensive but worth it!

This is one of my favorite brunch spots. The patio is so pleasant and there is usually a DJ. We sat and chatted for hours- the best part of brunch! We all enjoyed our food. Lots of mimosa options.  My only issue was that we were told we'd get a text when our table was ready. We never got a text and went to check with the hostess. She said she texted us but took us off the list because we didn't respond. We were like 2 feet away....annoying. There were clearly tons of open tables and they didn't even call our name.

This place is so cute! I had to go for the pretzel cone- that was love at first sight! I had hazelnut ice cream in said cone- it even had real hazelnut pieces mixed in! YUM! My sister ordered an ice cream sandwich and it was HUGE and delicious. The girl behind the counter was liiiiiitle awkward but mostly nice. I loved the mountains of candy all around too! The back patio is adorable and the perfect place to enjoy delicious ice cream.   The parking is kind of a mess but that's normal for the area I suppose.

Julie herself did my full set. I asked for "almond" shaped nails and she told me they call that "narrow." (In case you're wondering!) She did a great job, chatted just enough but not too much, and dealt with my neurotic questions. (Um does that look too pointy? Can you take care of this weird edge?)   From listening to other clients, it's clear all of their techs are really accommodating. Lots of people were bringing in Pinterest pictures and they were more than willing to try things out! They also offer bottled water. I think that's a nice touch. It's not the fanciest place, but they do great work and their prices are fair for the area.

I like this no frills nail spot in Tempe. They do a good job, they're fast, and can accommodate my weird nail art requests...like the time I asked for a pineapple on my thumbs. Get there early- I like to go before work sometimes right when they open but if you are there even a few minutes past 9:30, there's usually a wait. It's a convenient spot if you live in Tempe. Another perk is that it shares a parking lot with Essence Bakery- the perfect spot for a post-mani treat.

After a marathon shopping sesh at Last Chance, my mom & I needed some food! Cafe Zupas did not disappoint. This is a great "meet someone quick for lunch" spot.   As everyone has mentioned, the chocolate covered strawberry with every meal is such a nice touch! They were really accomdating when I wanted to sample like every delish looking soup.  My mom really enjoyed the Lobster Bisque, I loved the cauliflower soup.    The desserts were semi disappointing, but everything else was great.  OH! And my favorite part was that they have all of these different syrups that you can mix into your fountain drink.  it's really fun!

I came here a few months ago and experienced amazing service and a great pedi. I have a wedding this weekend and decided to stop by for a quick pedicure. Today was my last trip to Lili.   When I got there, everyone stared at me. There were no clients but 3 employees. Whatever- I can look past that. For $18, I'm not expecting the red carpet. I told them I needed to be quick and they were cool with that. I got in the chair and she started the pedi. The nail service was great......here's where it got cray. They have a flat screen that you can watch from your pedicure chair. Last time I was there they played music and then short clips about celebrity nail salons- I really enjoyed it. This time, one of the employees was playing YouTube videos (ON THE FLAT SCREEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME) of how to do prosthetic halloween make up: a nail through a finger, flesh eating virus, etc. As you can imagine, these images were disturbing. I could feel my stomach turning so I just kept my head down....but I could still hear it all. I think they noticed towards the end that I was uncomfortable so they turned the sound off...but HELLO! I was so upset i was trembling by the end. It was all in plain view! I get that I shouldn't  expect the most luxurious pedicure, but this was a little much. I tipped my tech but I let the YouTube gentleman know when I checked out that I would not be coming back and that it was the most uncomfortable pedicure of my life. His response? "I'm sorry...?" Do not step foot in this "business."

I am hard core Team Apple and usually I have excellent experiences in their stores. When I shattered the screen on my Iphone 5 & took it in to the Apple store they basically told me they couldn't help me. I did the logical thing that a 26 year old female would do and burst into tears. I knew my friend had taken his iphone to Itechs and I decided to try it because Apple decided to void my warranty and I had nothing to lose.   Teary eyed, I asked the guy behind the counter at Itechs if he could help me. He told me that it would take about 15 minutes and be about half the price I was expecting. I wanted to leap over the counter and kiss him! They were so friendly, so professional, and my phone is working great! I'm typing on it now! So I would highly recommend this place for honest repairs on any of your Apple devices!

I'm starting to believe I may be a service snob......but I just have to believe it is not THAT hard to give good service! I have been wanting to try this place- always trying to expand my brunch options! My sister and I put our name in and waited on the beach chairs out front (Love those!) and people watched. Our name was called and they put us at a booth inside. We noticed 2 high tops were available on the patio. I asked for one and she sat us out there. (Have no hostesses ever played "Sally's Diner"?! Gotta maximize and not use up all your 4 tops with just 2 people!)   Our server was nice....but not very experienced. My sister asked for a coffee recommendation and the caramel latte she got was almost minty. Not delish. I had just a coffee....which was rarely filled unless I asked. At one point I asked her to "warm up" my coffee a "little bit." She poured a tiny amount in and asked if it was okay. Haha Gotta get up on your brunch lingo, girl! Plus, I feel like I should never have to ask for a refill. Maybe that makes me a diva. What ever. We waited quite a while for our food (okay it was a Saturday morning-I can understand that.) BUT! When our food came it was luke warm at best. She never asked how our food was and dropped off our check with a "yep." No- we didn't want anything else, or a box, or anything..... Our plates were never cleared. We ended up walking the bill up to our server at the hostess stand....where she was standing and not refilling my coffee. ;-)  The food would have been good if it was hot but the service REALLY killed it for us. It was kind if painful being able to see The Breakfast Club from where I was sitting...next time I'll probably go there.

This place is so fun! I live in the east valley and my friend lives on the west side, so we love to find places to meet in Phoenix. This was the perfect spot. I tend to ask a million questions and the staff was more than happy to explain  anything and everything to me! I also love that they have red cream soda. It might look exactly like Chipotle but the flavor and quality is way better! Perfect Saturday afternoon lunch place.

I came here for a friend's birthday. It was the perfect spot for a celebratory dinner before heading out to Old Town. I had to do a Mai Tai because...it's their signature! It was awesome. Everyone had great drinks, actually, and our server kept them coming. The service was great even though we had a table of like 15 girls. This is a great choice for a date night, special occasion, or just a Saturday. Loved the fun but sort of mysterious atmosphere.

I was in desperate need of a laptop to pursue my blogging and social media dreams. (Ya feel me, Millennials?!) When I found Ample Bays amazing online deals, my dad offered to get me a MacBook Air for my birthday. I told him I thought it was a little too good to be true and had to check out the selection in person. Welp- they were as good as they said online. They have a grading system for appearance (A- great, B-couple scratches, etc). In my opinion, they are hard on themselves. I saw what they would grade a C and they looked great to me! I walked away with a fast MacBook Air and I'm in love! I invested in the 2 year warranty that covers everything- except loss or theft.   Everyone was friendly and helpful. They answered all my questions and didn't try to oversell me. (Even though they could have...I'm kind of a sucker. ;-)) The place has a family feel and I'll be back for future purchases!

Cannot recommend this place enough! My very first class, I sat in the parking lot for a while waiting for my friend to arrive so I didn't have to walk in alone. When I finally did walk in, the girls at the desk were like "WE WERE WONDERING WHEN YOU WERE GOING TO COME IN! SO GLAD YOURE HERE!"  "Sure you are..." I thought...still convinced this would be a pretentious, fit people only zone. Well, turns out I'm the worst and they people who work here are genuinely excited to see everyone who walks through the doors.   I wanted to throw up that first class but once you get past that, it's truly a party! The lights are fun, the music moves you, and you leave a sweaty mess! I love doing the 6am class and getting my day started with a blast of energy. Super fun- you should go. I'll save you a bike.

Jillian is a true beauty professional! Not only does she have a raw & natural talent for hair & nails, but she also takes the time to stay educated with in the industry. She'll give you her honest opinion of what she thinks would work best while also adding in her creative flair. Most of all, Jillian is a friend with a heart of gold. She treats all of her clients with respect and love- what more could you ask for? Also: HAVE YOU SEEN HER NAIL ART?!? INSANITY!

Like a teenager who's parents tell her not to date that young man with the tattoos and leather jacket, sometimes I just have to find out for myself. I read the reviews for this place. Over priced, they said. Too dense, they said. Come on- it's a donut! How bad can it be?  Turns out they were all correct. I got there at like 10:30am (which I understand is like 2am in the donut world.) They were out of the ones I had my eye on but I settled on the Samoa. Oh after I asked for a recommendation and didn't really get one. Just kind of a mumbled response. Then this conversation happened. Me: So the Samoa and a cup of coffee. Guy: Okay the Samoa any coffee or iced tea with that? Me: Yep, a cup of hot coffee. Guy: okay...(messes with the register) So you wanted a cup of coffee?  Then there was no cream out- fine. I get it... health code. But there were also no stirs by the utensils/sugar. I swirled my coffee with a plastic knife and went on my way.  Now, I'm not above paying for overpriced baked goods- especially when they're local. But the service and the donut were just underwhelming. 2 stars for the graphic design & creativity of flavors. I'll stick with Bosa.

Autumn is a hair genius! Her broad range of experience in color, cut, styling, & extensions makes her so amazing! I would send everyone from the pickiest tween to the most on trend model to my ornery grandma to Autumn- and they would all leave with the best head of hair they'd ever seen. #SoWorthIt
