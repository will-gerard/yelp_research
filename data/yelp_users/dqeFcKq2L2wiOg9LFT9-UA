Papa Trans Riblets are to die for! Moist, flavorful, get me a side of rice and ranch dipping sauce and I'm in heaven! If I could eat these for breakfast lunch and dinner I would, we drive 55 miles to eat these bad boys! Hint: order the large size and don't share because seriously even if your full you can still eat more! My mouth is watering now for Papa Trans Riblets! Ok gotta go !

You want truly authentic beef machaca with heavenly homemade tortillas, then you have come to the right place, they have original taco bell chairs from the 70's. The interior looks like a old abandoned school cafeteria, but never mind that the food is out of this world! I wish I lived closer to this gem! I tried their cactus location and it does not even compare to the south phx location on Mohave. Staff is ultra friendly.....they run a tight ship!

I buy most of my guns here, they have excellent customer service and a great inventory. Strange enough they have competitive pricing and the indoor shooting range is the best in town!

Dishonest dealers, stay away from this establishment like the plague.  Always comes up with a different story and not versed in customer service. Go to Scottsdale Gun Club for professional service and great selection.

I have to say above and beyond all tart yogurt places this place takes the cake. I love the pomegranate, it makes me feel soooo happy!!!!! I really like the color scheme they use and the fruit is always fresh.

I used to be a regular here at Gallo Blanco, although I have to say this place has gotten a little brazen! We took our sister in law for her birthday and arranged for a table of six, we also asked the hostess if the outside tables were first come first serve. She stated to us it was first come first serve. We purchased a margarita at the bar and asked for an extra shot of Tequilla in which the bartender charged me $6.00 plus the $5.00 for the Margarita then did a no sale and just collected the cash. We then proceeded to sit outside and have our cocktail, the hostess immediately came outside and told us in a very rude manner " you can't sit there" I know you have reservations , but all these tables on the outside are reserved" the hostess left , we were miffed, we asked another waitress if the tables were first come first serve and she said yes! We decided to take our dinner party to Hillstone, where people treat you with dignity, I guess Gallo Blanco  has such great crowd that they feel they don't have to have any decorum! Sad for you guys, it's not worth it anymore!

These guys at fresh wasabi microwaved my hamaichi Kama - scary!!!! Go to Sushi Brokers in Scottsdale for consistent and fresh sushi. Sorry this place does not cut it for me. Sushi rice was vinegary!

We shop at this grocery store approximately twice  a week for the past 7 months and we have to say that their customer service is horrible when it comes to checking out. The managers are rude, discourteous.   We now shop at Lee Lee Grocery at Dobson and Warner who welcomes our business and rather drive out of our way to patronize a company that is nicer and knows how to run a business.

Sad to say this place has gone downhill.  I have been frequenting this place for their terrific pizza and reccomending it to all my friends and family for many years. The last two times I have been there the crust was not up to par. After new years they had a lasagna special made with bolognaise meat sauce and it was un edible. The pasta was overcooked and the bottom was burnt, we told the waitress that the lasagna was burnt and we  would not eat it, it was not even possible to cut it with a knife. Our waitress just gave us a blank stare. Sorry to say the only thing left at pomos would be the tiramisu which is heavenly.

Ordered the seafood curry and it looked delicious but tasted very bland, we had to add sugar and fish sauce to make it edible. The pleasant waitress reccomended the spicy chicken as a special whch turned out to be the same sauce and style of Pandas Orange chicken and at $18.00 for orange chicken? Perhaps we came in at a bad day or did not order the right dishes? This place may be over rated. Service was spectacular! Food not!

I was headed to the Firehouse for firebreathing Show and a great dj but dropped in Rice Paper to burn some time and have a drink. I ended up staying at Rice Paper till almost midnight hanging out with the owners Lan and Hue who are extraordinary funny sisters I will call Hue Hollywood from here on out! Service is perfect, feels like family, food is dead on, I ordered the shaking beef, which was Cubes of Filet Mignon sauteed in this super " I could die for this sauce" with a nice plate of steamed rice with a  side with grilled zucchini. Hue also makes a mean Grey Goose with a splash of Pineapple!!!!! "Picture her splashing pinneaplle juice many times here" I also ordered the traditional Summer Rolls, they were heavenly. I can't wait to go back !!!

Wow, yet another amazing restaurant, how come that does not "Surprise" me, coming from the "Sister" restaurant "Rice Paper". Dropped in last night to see what the buzz was about and ordered the Fillet & Jumbo Shrimp with fresh lemon grass which was made with perfection with a perfectly balanced dipping sauce served with a side of rice, a small bowl of the pho soup stock and a tasty side salad. Dennis and Hue brought out  a  Cornish Game hen that was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, these culinary marvels don't mess around!!! and of course it also came with a wonderful dipping sauce. Both dishes were superb not to mention the hospitality from Dennis the proprietor who tells me he only  uses the freshest ingredients and boy your palate sure notices the difference. The food quality exceeds the price of the menu, I would pay double for the quality given here. Saigon Kitchen you have a customer for life here, can't wait to bring my family in here. Looks like Saigon Kitchen and Rice Paper are my home away from home now!!!!

Ordered the eggplant chicken and it was bland nothing to write home about, tried the rib appetizer and found  it to be on the greasy side, then ordered the Penang curry with chicken and delivered green curry instead - looked great but was very bland in flavor, maybe we ordered all the wrong dishes? Also asked the waitress if the potstickers were made in house then ordered those only to find out that they are frozen potstickers deep fried and drizzled with mustard and sweet and sour sauce - very unappealing! Glad to say I will not ever be returning to this place. We also ordered a beef dish I forgot the name of it but what shocked me is the beef slices were square and were as hard as nails - they tasted and looked as if they  were boiled and not saut√©ed, scary meat! This beef will bounce to mars it's so rubbery!

Service A+, decor very nice, Bul Gogi and side dishes = Phenomenal. Can't wait to go back. These guys know how to put out top quality Bul-Gogi! Super fresh rib-eye beef.  What a treat to have them open up a few months ago, truthfully the best Korean Food in Arizona, look no further, you will not be disappointed!
