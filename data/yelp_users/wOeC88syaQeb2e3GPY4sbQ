We came to this place based on the yelp reviews!  The location is off the beaten path and the building looks very suspicious but once you walk in you know you picked a great little lunch spot.  The service was really quick and extremely friendly.  I had the chicken melt and it was good, the tatter tots were so crispy and delicious I could have just eaten a plate of those! The chili was great but a little spicy for my taste.  I will definitely be going back.

If I could give negative stars I would! This is my very first review and I only write it because my experience was truly that bad....I am only speaking about the portrait studio.   We made an appointment to have my daughter's pictures taken with my son and nephews I told the lady the exact pose I wanted and she must have been in a hurry because she snapped 8 pictures as quickly as she could and didn't even care if the kids had their eyes closed.   When we were ready to view our pictures they were all horrible everyone with closed eyes not a single good picture.   The whole point of professional photos is to make sure you get good shots!! I will never never never go back

I would give this place negative stars if that was possible!!!   MOST HORRIBLE SERVICE EVER!!! DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THEM:  We purchased a RZR  900 Jagged X and a Honda TRX 700XX on October 16th.  We were lied to by the sales associate, the sales manager and the finance manager on multiple occasions.  Both of our units did not work and required serious repairs before they were operational.  Which the dealership attempted to have us pay for.  It took them a month to get the plates to us for the TRX700 and over two months later they still can't tell us where the plates for the RZR are or even if they have submitted for them.  their General manager is not returning our calls so we are posting our story every where we can.  Our review is much much longer with over 2 months of back and forth and having our units there on multiple occasions at times for 2 weeks.  We want help getting what we paid over $20,000 for.

Stopped in with some family not expecting to eat, as soon as their food came I had to try a slice!! I ordered by the slice pizza and it was way larger than expected.  They added an extra layer of cheese to the top to make sure my toppings didn't slide off the pizza.  It was delicious! The pizza had a perfectly crispy crust.  The wings were excellent, crispy and not saugy or of sauced.  We also ordered the pizzokie and that was delicious as well.  Great prices, excellent food.  We will be back next Saturday.

This is my go to lunch spot!!! I can eat here every single day of the week and still be happy with my choice.  My favorite sandwich is the Sparky and the chili is excellent.  This last time I went they had a different potato salad and I was not a fan at all.  The bread is always soft and everything i have tried has been perfect.  Everyone I introduce to this little place falls in love.

I typically love olive garden it has always been a go to for us when we want to dine out. Today's experience was a complete disaster.  Our waitress was nice and all but my the meat on my lasagna was Uncooked and I mentioned it to her and her response was let me ask the kitchen then she didn't say anything else about it the rest of the night I had to stop a manager and explain to him and his response was we went with a new meat sauce so it just taste different.  Ummmmmmmmm no its not cooked I don't think that is a different sauce taste! Then I get my bill to find I was charged for an extra meal and drink she had to take my ticket back 2 times to get it right. Now I have an additional $50 charge on my card because she ran it twice and now I have to wait for it to fall off! Horrible experience, if you are going to spend your money on a meal pick somewhere else!

I love this place, we have been going for a while and have tried a few different items.  I am always torn on what to order as I love the 3 flour tacos, the nachos or burrito.  The barbacoa is my favorite (it is a bit spicy but not too much).  The staff is always friendly and really great, during the lunch rush it gets packed and there isn't much room for sitting.

This is our new go to pizza place, we love the pizza and the crispy crust.  The wings are great , we have never eaten at the restaurant as we always pick it up and bring it back home.

Most fantastic BBQ I have ever had! The fatty beef brisket is melt in your mouth perfect.  We showed up at 11:30 ( they open at 11am) and we waited for over an hour to place our order, but it was worth every minute in line! The pulled pork is also perfection and the sausage was amazing! The beans and potato salad left something to be desired but were delicious all the same! It was a little pricy but again worth it! I ordered a pound of brisket and a pound of pulled pork to take home it was so good.  Be sure that you show up early as they run out of food frequently and you may miss out on the good stuff! The whole thing is more of an experience than just a meal

I showed up 10 minutes before they were about to close on a Sunday (I know I'm the worst).  Michelle was so sweet and didn't mind at all.  I came in just for a trim but she didn't rush at all and took her time to make sure my hair looked good.  I asked for a shampoo and she really took her time the massage was fantastic.  She trimmed up my hair and showed me how to use a diffuser.  Absolutely fantastic service.  I will be coming back!!!

The food was not what I would have expected.  The sesame chicken had way too much sauce and the chicken itself was soggy and not flavored properly.  the egg rolls were delicious and just about the only thing on the menu that I would ever order again.  The rice was bland and the noodles were over salted.

What a disappointment!! The bagel man was closed so I came here as it was just down the street.  The cashier was HORRIBLE it seemed like I was an inconvenience.  They couldn't print a receipt and their credit card reader didn't work.  The bagels were waaaaaaaay over priced for a bacon egg and cheese bagel.  I almost walked out when I noticed the guy behind the counter making the eggs in the microwave!! My hunger pains and lack of time caused me to stay.   I haven't taken my first bite and I already hate everything about this experience......ugh hopefully their food is not as shitty as their service or I am in for a horrible Monday breakfast.  Update:  As expected the sandwich was HORRIBLE!!! There was enough pepper to kill a small child.  The egg tasted bland and the bagel was nothing to be excited about.  If I could give some negative stars I totally would.  What a waste of $5.14!!!
