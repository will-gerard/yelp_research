This hotel is so much fun. I live not even a mile away and it was the perfect stay-cation. The rooms are a perfect size, beds are incredibly comfortable. My favorite part was the pool and pool bar. There is a DJ on the weekends which made the whole experience that much better. Also, the hotel is Dog friendly which made it really convenient for us so we didn't have to board him. Once we checked in the brought us a dog blanket, bowl, treats, doggy bags and a toy. I would recommend anyone to stay here.

Very disappointed with the service. I've been looking for decent quality take out and that's why I tried The Side Door. I ordered an hour before I got my food, and I was told 20-25 minutes till ready and had to ask three times, is our food almost ready, which was a salad and sandwich. The bartender responded with "sorry, sometimes it gets backed up." Once we finally got our food, there were no napkins or silverware put into our bag. There were no apologies and nothing to try and get my business back. The food presentation was poor and the bar tender didn't know too much about the beer selection. I ordered a sanwhich which didn't come with a side, but the bartendsr didnt even offer a side or salad to go with the sandwich, which was possible to order. Overall I was not happy and wouldn't recommend to others.

Awesome food!! The cutest restaurant in DC Ranch. A little pricey, but great place to go with a group.

Awesome sammi's! Great portions, and lots to chose from. A little pricey, but worth the buck. It's nice to go into a family owned restaurant and feel the love, they really want you to enjoy every bite!

We hired Tucker as our real estate agent to sell our house earlier this year and couldn't have been happier.  Not only did Tucker list our property on the MLS, but he actively marketed it and was able to bring us a buyer within the first 30 days.  His proactive approach, market knowledge, and business network helped us to get the price that we wanted without having to sacrifice our sanity.  Tucker made great suggestions along the way that really brought our house up to par and helped get us ready for the home inspection portion that I was worried about.  I would highly recommend Tucker to anyone looking for an agent to represent them in the sale of their home!
