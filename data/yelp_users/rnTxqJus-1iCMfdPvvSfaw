It's impossible to go here and not find a gem. They always have such good stuff and for the most part- its reasonably priced. I feel like it's way more reasonable than Buffalo Exchange. I got some brand new Frye boots but they have a great jean selection, most of the designer stuff (Hudson, Joes, 7s) are in the $30 price range.

I love this place. I wish it was a little easier to figure out the ordering situation.  The people that work here are so helpful and patient and nice! I've always been really really overwhelmed by the menu at most locations because they don't have any descriptions next to the sandwiches but this one did- Thank goodness!! The salad i had was so fresh and the half sandwich half soup deal is really a great bargain.  i'm really looking forward to the location close to me in Tucson opening soon.

We didn't eat... only drank. It was a monday night, so we weren't expecting much to be going on. The bartender didn't expect much either. He really didn't seem too in to us even being there. I had a signature cucumber drink. It was syrupy and over the top.

Awesome!!!!! The veggie salad was a great choice. I would absolutely recommend it to everyone. We had the chicken Parmesan pizza which was also delicious. They have the most amazing pizza dough. We started out with the caprice  app which was yummy and original

I could not be happier with my stay here.  They really did go above and beyond to make our stay for a bachelorette party memorable, they even sent a bottle of complimentary champagne to our room :) We had a cabana at the pool during the day which we really enjoyed. We got moved around a few times and everyone working seemed a little bit confused but once we got settled it- it was awesome! We went back to the bar by the pool before going out for the night and we were served by Bethanie. She was the best! I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay and i will be staying here again!
