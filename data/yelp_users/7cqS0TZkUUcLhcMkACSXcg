Tonight I ordered Thai Fried rice and Veg chop suey.  It was delicious. the yellow curry, oops, I should have asked for a curry with coconut... like the green or panang.  my bad. I truely love this place. Loyal customer for almost a decade and will keep coming back.  it was nice to have dinner cooked for me after I worked so hard.  The owners are pretty cool people and the art and energy they share is awesome. I need to go here more often! Maybe I should apply.  lol

I'm not sure what it takes for you to give a 5 star, but for me it takes leaving the place satisfied and happy! The Bat Cave has a little something for everyone, from the patio to the bar you can find customized experience of New Mexican cuisine.  The experience at Carlsbad Tavern is pretty optional, as the staff caters to where ever you like to seat and whatever it is that you need.    The menu items are exceptionally well thought and obviously there is no need for modifications.  If you like spicy, Carlsbad is all about that chili.  You can literally get educated about chilies by the posters on the wall, so pay attention!    My favorite items off the menu would be whatever Chef Ruben is cooking as his special, or the Crab Stuffed Poblanos for dinner, and the Portales Portbello for lunch. Happy Hour is everyday and there's a drink menu with more than 5 mules, so five stars right there... need I say more? Wait, don't let me forget to mention they have a late night dinning menu until 1 or 2 am... that's impressive!  If you leave with out having the Dolce de Leche fried ice cream, you will being doing yourself an incredible disservice.  It is the best thing I have ever tasted! Can't wait to bring my family here!   Restaurant week.... here I come!

Who else does happy hour on Saturday and Sundays? Try the New Mexican Potstickers, they are the best!  I could live off of them alone, of course WITH a Cabo Wabo Margarita!

The patio is the best this time of year. I love the happy hour specials. My favorite are the spicy crab cakes with a refreshing margarita. The weather is just perfect to sit outside for lunch and the waterfall is relaxing. Can't wait for the 20th anniversary on November 22. I heard drinks and food for a penny for lunch. You can guess where I will be!!!  Great service. Great drinks. Good prices. Local owned, New Mexican cuisine. What more can you ask for?

Delivery saved the hung over day!!!  Delicious soup. Sweet and sour was delicious and he brought me a sprite for free. Very nice and I feel much better. I'll be getting delivery again soon   YUM. Even my son loved it which earned them the five stars because he doesn't usually care for Chinese.

This place is charming. The food is top notch. The service is great. Anthony is friendly, it was nice to meet the creator of many of the recipes. I always buy my favorite wine here. The deli is also great!  I am waiting with an orange blossom by Papago brewery for my artichoke veggie lasagna!  Can't wait to try it!  Do come here! The mornings are chill.

good afternoon buzz with my girl.  it was ok.  I didn't eat or drink, so no star no star, but if I had, I am sure it would have been good.  thanks for the restroom stop, for that, you get 5 stars. and my girlie had wine.

I payed $200 plus an additional $65 to tow for them to return my car to me with a $3700 estimate. Found out I could get the same job done for just over $2000.  My car was returned with the bumper plastic guard broke.  they charged me $100 to tow and $100 diagnostic.  That is ridiculous, I want to warn people of their inflated prices.  The diagnostic I could understand, but the broken car and extra $30 for the tow is ridiculous. I do plan on repairing my vehicle, but it won't be here.

I wanna give a five star, so I say five star for the food.  My happy margarita should have had a bit more tequila and the only thing I can complain about is the service, interpersonal skills go a long way.  I really love the authentic food and will come back again.  just make my marg. stronger ok.

I love the berry salad in a wrap. But I need my coffee first.  This place has a great vibe and it's healthy and Eco-conscious. What's not to love?

Was recommended by a friend . I was not expecting BEST WINGS EVER!!!!! It is a hipster place with TONS of seating and great burgers and wings. Great service, could be faster offering refill on my drank, but I'm a wee impatient sometimes and it was Thirsty Thursday after all.  They have private room for parties  and many craft brews of every sort.  Bike and car parking and pretty fun time.

I forgot the servers name, but she is awesome.  I go here a lot and I really like the entire experience all the time.  I modify my veggie roll with soy paper and mint.  the upcharge on the mint is the only thing I can complain about, maybe next time I'll bring my own mint.  Even tho its a corporate sushi restaurant, it is my second favorite stop at the Tempe Marketplace, following Bev Mo, of course. haha

I love kabuki but tonight it was majorly off. Tonight we visited kabuki to get our spirits up and minds off of recent hard times as we often do.   It started with the server getting my order wrong. We ordered two of the salmon asparagus and only received one. The funny thing is I'm glad we only received one because the salmon was warm and mushy and I ended up sending it back anyways. The restaurant was busier than usual so maybe that was the reason why our rainbow roll and vegetable tempura roll came out all messed up looking. It seems to me that the staff cannot handle too much business at once because the quality of the food and the service really downgraded. I was so sad when I left because kabuki in Tempe marketplace is one of my very favorite places as you can tell by my   I was also very disappointed that after I sent my food back that not one manager came over to talk to me about it and I saw at least two managers on duty.

I was thoroughly impressed. I love the candlelit patio and scenery with live plants. All of the little details in decor fit the mood. The misters were a nice touch because it was a warm evening. The timing with the meal was perfect and the Sea-bass was probably the best I have ever experienced. I loved the large oyster mushrooms in the grain dish, the cauliflower truffle (i think it was the first course soup) had a very piney flavor and was most enjoyable.   My company was special and this was the perfect place for special.  The Owner was our server and we could tell how much he cared that everything was perfect! It was very relaxing and an enjoyable 2 1/2 hours that I wish could have lasted forever.  I hope I will have the pleasure of dining with the Monarchs again in the near future. love

Five stars for a breath of fresh air. Ken Singh, land artist extraordinaire and Adam, soil guy is the best part of the farm and helped me start my own garden by providing the best soil .  I love the flowers and trails through a shaded oasis, rare find in AZ for sure and practically in my back yard.  If I had not worked there in the past, I would still be a regular visitor, it was much better working there when the hoards of rude people were not around.  It is a magical place and I highly recommend learning more about them! Long Live Gardens

Tonight Skyler made our visit to Echo incredibly uncomfortable. We purchased 2 brownies and 3 macchiatos for myself and my Daughter (22) and son (16).  We planned to hang out on the couch and have a good time, then go home and watch Dexter.  He made our macchiatos in to-go glasses and then insisted when we said we wanted them for here, that he swore that is how we ordered them, but we insisted that we wanted them here, then his excuse was a misunderstanding, meanwhile he told my daughter to get the fuck out of his store over "$9.00 of product".  All she wanted was her macchiato, of which was the third one she had there on Sunday and to chill in Echo and show her little brother why she loved them so much.  This happened around 9 pm and that sorry excuse for a barista ruined my daughters last visit to Echo from California.  This was our last night out and he made her cry, how inappropriate and inexcusable.  He lied straight to my face so I am sure he would make a much better emo bartender than a barista at my favorite neighborhood coffee joint. He refused to call the owners so I would like to be in contact with them as soon as possible please.  I will be there in the morning to complain about this experience. I am pist and the guy with green hair needs to straighten up his attitude, I can not believe he is allowed to talk to the patrons that way.

I came for the vegetarian menu. I'm impressed and might bring someone here for a fancy drink.  It doesn't seem casual enough for some more I like to hang out on a regular basis though.

If you ask me to go, I will!  I love the Herb box, it was amazing.  We sat at the bar, (forgot the tenders name) but, it was great.  The service was perfect timing, the food was delicious and I can't wait to frequent here this Fall!    Cheers to the season!

DISGUSTING.  I thought it would be a great breakfast burrito, I mean, how can you get that wrong besides letting a half of an egg shell get munched into your food.  DO NOT GO HERE you will get sick!    When I called, the manager said it happens all the time, just like hairs in the food and it's no big deal to him.  I will never stop there on the way home again.  I should have known not to order from them when I saw the rotten water where the drive thru window was. I hate wasting my money on establishments that should not even be open.  #healthdepartment911!

Have chilled here many times.  The vibe is relaxed, a little over priced on the drinks, but that keeps the place classy. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the trout skin.  cleaver recipe and over the top.  I wish they had a "always happy hour" side menu for drinks!  Love the live band on Fridays, they are worth going to see.

My son loved his smoothie.  Never had Ful medames in my life until now, and I will rave about it forever.  I want MORE!!!!

It's hard to decide how to critique Plato's, because I don't like to give bad reviews for reused recycled and second hand businesses.  The reason I wanted to review Plato's is to let them know that several times  I have tried something on and loved it, I looked closer to find holes and reckless flaws.   I also need to complain about your USED shoes.  Yes, some of them are cute, but asking $50 for a used pair of Nikes is unreasonable.  I drove down the street to the Goodwill and bought a cute pair of Nikes for $8.99. I would have bought 2 pairs from you if they were $10 - $15 each!   I spent $12 on a shirt and $5 on a little pocket purse when I visited your store, but if your prices had been more reasonable for used items, I would have spent minimum $40 like I did down the street at the Goodwill.    I love second hand stores, without first hand prices.  Thanks.

Love the Buddha spring rolls. Best peanut sauce I have ever had. Crispy noodles hit the spot but my recommendation is to ask for extra sauce because it is delicious.   Couple days ago I had the veggie pho and it was wonderful The main reason that I came back decides the kettle one mule which was one of the best mules I ever had

Love Healthy Food and people making an effort to provide locally sourced meals.  Only thing I can complain about is that I wish the juice was made in front of me fresh and that the menu was more like Nourish 123 that closed in Scottsdale, including the alcohol!!!!  No big service, order at the registrar doesn't turn me on, but I understand we all want to pay for less employees. long live the day when people valued their employees
