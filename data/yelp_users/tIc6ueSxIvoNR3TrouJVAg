Beyond disappointed. I've been coming here for quite sometime and the service has slowly gotten worse every time. My visit yesterday will be my last.   Arrived around 9:15 the place was busy but not packed. Took 15 minutes to get menus and over 30 minutes to get hot tea. I had to ask twice and when I had to ask a different waiter he seemed very bothered and I said "I'm sorry but should it take over 30 minutes and asking twice to get my drink" his response was "I guess so". Tea was delivered 2 minutes later with lukewarm water & no apology.   When my food arrived, I asked the server for tomatillo salsa as that's what I had ordered and they brought me fire roasted. The servers response was to argue, continually that it was tomatillo "it's just not as green and that's all we have do you want it or not" then behind her came our server with the tomatillo salsa, the other server who stood there and scolded me about how she knew their salsa turned and stormed off, no apology for the confusion.   My mom ordered the chorizo scrabble, the chorizo amount delivered could & did (we were curious) fit exactly on a tablespoon. Looks like they are running out?    I've really tried to support hillside as I love the atmosphere and going to local businesses but you guys seriously need to get it together and make some drastic changes! I can't tell you one person who I've taken there in the last year and has had a good experience. Your food quality is going down, your service is slow and the staff is beyond rude, consistently!   In reading your yelp reviews, your management should be seeing the trend. You don't respond to your customers and in person I have never once had a manager come out to fix the problem. This tells me that your staff is a direct reflection of the ownership.

Great line up, lots of laughs tonight and I'll only say that Howard was amazing because he "responds to reviews"! If you haven't checked this place out, do!! Seating is cozy and tables are usually shared but it's a cool atmosphere. Drinks are pricey but laughter and good times are priceless, enjoy!

Great place, prices and great staff! I go here regularly and have always had a great experience. The owner Jenny takes pride in her work and always wants her customer's happy with their service. You can't say this about a lot of places, but I have had my nails and pedicures done with each staff member here and they are all great at what they do it's nice to be able to walk in and get equally good service from everyone there. So glad I found you!   Cleanliness is a 5 out of 5 Color selection 5  Quality of service 5

What can I say, don't be fooled by their good looks and charm. The studs at no limits scuba aren't just pretty faces, they're smart and professional too. They set us up with our gear, gave us a great deal on the stuff we bought and gave us a great experience. Our instructor Jeff was amazing, so knowledgeable and patient in his instruction. I did my research when looking for shops and I highly recommend NLS, prices are competitive around the valley but I promise you'll get what you paid for with them.

Went in today for a full service carwash but had to leave with the car not done due to them getting backed up and taking much longer than estimated. I'm giving a 5 star review though because good customer service goes a long ways in my book. The general manager, Sean immediately returned my call, gave me a refund and mailed me a voucher to come back and receive the full service plus a a Wax to apologize for the inconvenience. I really appreciate when someone goes the extra mile to make things right, thank you!

Love this place! The staff is so friendly and the food is great. It's a vegan kitchen with a unique way to order and customize your pancakes, oatmeal or breakfast cereal and yes, they have GF! It's a must try when you're looking for something heart healthy and delicious.   Shot out to the people working here, our order was wrong and they were so kind about it they even packed the incorrect one to go with a kind note .

Really good food, quick, clean and many gluten free options! Highly recommend this place, would've given 5 stars if the staff was friendlier in talking to me about the GF options.
