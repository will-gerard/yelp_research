Houston's is incredible!!!!!! Spinach artichoke dip so good the incredible filet mignon. Like butter and delicious. Service was excellent and the food was brought out with perfect timing. What a great place that I can't wait to visit again.

Ordered the Mongolian beef combo and the Kung pao chicken combo. Their fried rice has no vegetables in it. It's pretty much rice with soy sauce cooked into it. There was pretty much no color to the entire order - it was all brown. The egg rolls were soggy and pretty bland. It's a lot of food for the money that you pay, but it's just not worth it because of the grease, brown color, and it all tasted the same as in - the greasy low mean tasted like the fried rice which tasted the same as the entree.  also tried the egg flower soup and it didn't keep a brothy consistency at all. It started to get thick and grease started to float to the top.   The $25 for takeout was a waste of my money. Pretty much took a few bites and could Not finish it. Should have just had a bowl of cereal for dinner or paid the extra money for Pei Wei. Lesson learned.

Sacks !!! Omg i had them for the first time back in 2011 the art of sandwicherie is correct .  Every time we go back we try something new but this one is a house favorite  Sack's Symphony (Turkey breast, bacon, avocado, tomato, alfalfa  sprouts, cream cheese and mayo on 12 grain bread)

This place changed my wife's views about seafood. When we first met she was not a big fan of seafood till Pappadeux took her mind to a new dimension.   Must try items  * Seafood Gumbo * Shrimp Etouffee With white rice * Atlantic Salmon Yvette * Tilapia Lafayette  Pappadeux is a winning at all times wish there was more locations in phoenix

Omg the burgers are to die for.  The grind is one of my favorites places to grab a good burger and beer would highly recommend if you have not tired.

Hum, If you are expecting an AMAZING sandwich...try some place else. Potbelly is just another quiznos-esk sandwich shop. Nothing unique, nothing special other then live music.
