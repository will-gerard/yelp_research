The food was below average relative to the prices. I enjoyed the food, but it was not fine dining quality. Based on the prices (around 150 for two people), I expected something quite memorable, but instead it was quite mediocre.   If you sit on the patio on a cool fall evening, this would be a nice place to have a few drinks, but I certainly wouldn't go for the food. Of course, the building is beautiful and creates a great environment.  Also, the service was very sub-par on most accounts. Even the hostess was unfriendly and didn't smile or say more than two words. The manager was friendly and the person who delivered the food was very friendly.

I have been going to Macayo's for years and they have some delicious mexican food. My personal favorite is the chimichanga, which is amazing. I have a hard time ordering anything else because it is perfect. My wife tried the chili relleno last time and that was delicious as well. I've had many different things here and have never been disappointed. Their free chips and salsa are delicious too. I can't find a single complaint.

Great food. Can't get enough. I've had the tortas a couple of times and they are amazing. The pasole is unbelievable, but it is a large portion. I'd recommend sharing a small order of pasole and a torta. I've had the tacos, but they weren't my favorite.

Used to come here semi-regularly, but hadn't been in a while. We went the other day for the first time in years and we probalby won't be back. The prices are pretty good and you get a decent amount of food, but the quality of the food is not great. Nothing seems fresh and the flavors are very weak. I believe this place's best days are in the past and unless they improve the food quality, they will be in trouble.

Just went for the first time over the weekend and I can't wait to go back. A friend and I went and got the Pad Thai and the Spicy Thai Rice and both were amazing. The prices are great and the service is great also.

This has to be the best Thai food around. I have tried a few other places, but none are as authentic and delicious as Swaddee. We are now regulars and have never been disappointed.

Good service, but below average food.   I'm not much of a seafood person, so when we go to seafood restaurants, I order some type of chicken or steak. At the Salt Cellar I ordered a rib eye steak. I know that you shouldn't go to a seafood restaurant and order anything other than seafood, but my steak was surprisingly bad. There was absolutely no seasoning on my steak... no salt... no pepper... no flavor.  If the kitchen can't prepare a decent steak, they shouldn't have it on the menu and it shouldn't be $40. Unfortunately, it made our experience a disappointment and we won't be back.

The food was delicious and the service was even better. Our server, Jeff, was great and was very helpful with each question. We had creme brulee for desert and it was ridiculous. We hope to go back soon.

The sushi is great and the prices are unbeatable. Their happy hour is half off of almost all sushi and the happy hour is available almost all of the time. Each guest gets free miso soup, sesame dressing salad, and edamame. You can have some ice cream at the end if you have room left. The service is good and everyone is friendly. I highly recommend the Mido roll and the Fried Jalapeno Yellowtail roll. The Gyoza roll is also delicious.

We tried this place hoping to find a good Chinese spot, but left disappointed with very mediocre Chinese food.  We had General Tso Chicken (1/5) and Hunan Chicken (3/5). We also had spring rolls (2/5), wontons(0/5), and hot & sour soup (1/5). The only decent thing was the Hunan Chicken. Unfortunately, we probably won't be back.

The food is really great. A couple of us went in there a week or so ago to try it out. Neither of us are too familiar with Indian food and we were a little concerned, but it was amazing. Everything we had was delicious. The restaurant was very clean and the service was excellent. We weren't a fan of the desserts, but everything else was very good. The portions are large, so we had plenty to take home. We will definitely be back soon to try some other items.

Went there last week and we were very pleasantly surprised. Everything on the menu looked delicious. We had an order of onion rings to start out and they were great. Then we had a couple of steaks for dinner. The Beef Bistro Tender was rediculous. If you're getting a steak, go for this one. The price is great also. We had the New York Strip as well, but it didn't hold a candle ot the other. Avoid the strip and go for the bistro tender. They have a great selection of beers. They are devoted to using local products and making everything from scratch and it shows. We'll definitely be back.

We had the Queso Fundido with Taquitos for an appetizer. The dip was great and the chips were great, but the taquitos were dry and boring. For entrees, we had the mole, which was good, but not great. We also had the mango, chipotle chicken and the sauce was great, but the chicken was dry and overcooked. None of the flavor was soaked into the chicken, so it tasted bland.  As others have said, the entrees are very large, so that is a plus.  We would like to come back and try happy hour and some "safer" entrees such as the chimichanga and hopefully they will be better executed.
