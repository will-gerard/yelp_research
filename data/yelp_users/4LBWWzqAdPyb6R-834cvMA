The service was horrible. Our server was also the bartender and she could not manage the bar and our table. She only checked in on us once and we had to wait for refill chips and drinks and over 20 minutes for our bill.  The manager was very short with our table and did nothing to manage the slow, poor service. There was a second server who could have helped our table as well but only stopped when we were ready to leave to take away empty plates. Our order was also incorrect and the food was only average. We will never return to this Chili's.

Great place! We went with a group of 10 and played at 2 bays next to each other.  Prices were decent and service was excellent! Would definitely recommend this place for any occasion. We will be going back!
