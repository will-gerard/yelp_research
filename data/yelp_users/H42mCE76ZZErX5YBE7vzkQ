For the price, not the greatest experience. Like Craig M. says, it's fairly dated, but the rooms are passable. Great views, if slightly noisy if you have street-facing windows. The staff were very hit-or-miss, ranging from completely unaccamodating to friendly and helpful. Big minuses: no WiFi unless you're in the lounge at perscribed times or want to pay 15 pounds a day for it, and no adapters for my sad USA plugs. I was directed to the supermarket, and then to Marks&Spencer, and then they were out of ideas. It was a good location, but if I'm back in Edinburgh I probably will not opt to stay there again.

I had about an hour or so to kill before a flight and was dragging around a rolly suitcase (i.e. had no desire to try to sight-see), and stumbled across this place. Got myself a cider and sat down to read and occasionally watch Sportcenter at the bar. Service was mostly prompt, though I had to really flag the dude down for my check.   I got a hangover burger and was duly impressed by two things: it actually was rare, and the egg was runny. Usually both burger and egg tend to come overcooked whenever I've ordered them elsewhere, so I was psyched. The bacon was also excellent. Pleasantly surprised!
