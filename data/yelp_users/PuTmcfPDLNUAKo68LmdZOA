I love this place, we actually went twice this weekend!    They have some veggie options on the menu which is nice, and they are happy to change anything around to make it vegetarian if you'd like.  The service is friendly and the prices are great.    The meat eaters at my table said that the meats were fantastic and we all left very happy!

I can't actually rate the food because we left before it got that far.   Drinks and service were horriable - not to mention the fact that it was like 100 degrees in there. Ohh and they  seem to have worked very hard in the design to  fit the absolute max amount of people per square foot with zero regard for comfort. There are tables jammed into every possible space.

Let me just start by saying a HUGE thank you to both Lindsay and the Capital Grille for such a fantastic event!  The venue was amazing, I had not had a chance to come in before and I can tell you I will be back!   Service was above and beyond amazing and the food was delicious.  My husband loved the tenderloin sliders and I was very thankful that I've started adding some seafood back into my diet and was able to enjoy those lobster rolls!   I think I'll dream of those coconut cream desserts for the rest of my life!   This was the first time I was able to actually attend an Elite event, I've always had to skip them for one reason another (sad since I'm now in my 3rd year as an Elite member) but this was absolutely amazing.  Thank you again Lindsay and everyone and Capital Grille for such an amazing event, events like these make being a Yelp Elite member truly special!

I brought my mom for a special birthday brunch because even as natives we'd never had a chance to stop by and visit this amazing property and I'm so glad we finally did.  The service and food were both amazing. If you're looking for a great place to take out of town guests for brunch this is a great idea. Especially in the spring when you can set outside and really enjoy the weather and grounds.   My favorite thing was that there was no waffle station or omelet bar or anything else like that. The buffet is for cold items and desserts. No hot stuff. In addition to that you can pick up "hot plates" which you order and are delivered directly to your table. I LOVE this! Also enjoy a few breakfast cocktails - you'll thank me!

I used to LOVE this place.  Now I am very disappointed, for one there is no vegetarian item on the menu that are not a side dish.  Also when ordering things and making them vegetarian they seemed really bothered by it.  Lastly they broke my husbands debit card and didn't say anything about it, how sad is that.  I was really disappointed by the whole meal, from start to finish.  Will not be back.

They're open 8:30-5:00 Monday - Friday, I know this only because I called and had to interrogate the receptionist.  Nearly asking for the hours was not enough.    When I arrived today at about 11:00 the lights were off, also it's located in a building with a different sign, I'm not actually sure how anyone finds this place.  When I walked in a gentleman doing nothing ignore me.  The receptionist who was with a customer didn't even look at over and no one bothered to turn the lights on.  I lasted about another 30 seconds before leaving.  I won't be back.

My first appointment with Dr Wyatt I was 6 months pregnant. My gag reflex was nonexistent and the wonderful assistant doing my xrays was such a trooper. She let me break and breath and didn't make me feel guilty about taking to long. I'm actually getting ready to return for another appointment to have some fillings done. Entire staff including Dr Wyatt are great about making what usually sucks at the very least bearable!

It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.  Turnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.

I absolutely love this office. My son is 9 months old and has been seeing Dr. Lombard here for his entire life lol. We had picked another pediatrician in the office, and Dr. Lombard happened to be on call when I delivered and we decided to stick with her. She always has the same MA, Maria. She's very sweet and great with our son. The entire staff is wonderful.

Headed into the new offices for the first time today, they're great!  A lot more room to move which is nice.  My only major complaint in the almost 3 years we've been with Dr. Lombard and Great Destinations is once my mom came in with us for a check up and Dr. Lombard directed the entire conversation at her.  I found that to be not only rude but frustrating.  I asked the question, he's my son, please talk to  me.  The other staff is fantastic though, everyone is friendly and helpful.

I've been enjoying this place for a lot of years and it was in a serious slump for the last maybe 2 years but when we visited last week it was back to where it once was.  The burger was quality, and the service was friendly.    I do wish they'd do a better job of cleaning tables but aside from that it was a pleasure to be back at a quality Fuddruckers experience. This is a great place to get a quality inexpensive place for the whole family.

It's Chili's I didn't go in with overwhelming expectations but we were hungry and wanted something quick.   Service was very slow, food came out a bit cold.  It felt like it was sitting on the warmer for a while because the food was cold in the middle but the plates where really warm.  This was especially surprising since there were 2 people working our area but only a few other tables had anyone sitting there.  Overall we won't be back, but in all honesty it's not a regular stop for us anyway.

I really like this location.  We never have trouble getting help.  When we bought our new phones last year they were helpful and again when I upgraded this year.  My only issue with the mobile department is I wish they had live phones not just shells.    We've been here a lot, we also purchased a new desktop at this location this year.  It was listed a week later at a lower price and they gave us the difference back in cash with no problems.  Always very helpful. and the  store is always clean.

It's very poorly laid out, it seems no matter where you stand you're in the way.  Only real plus is it's a few cents cheaper then the Dysart drive-thru location, but personally that doesn't change anything.  I'll grab a coffee here if I'm heading into Target, but more often then not I've already stopped at the Dysart location on my way.

I love Macayo's but not this location.  Went in the other night and the service was terrible.  The food was so so and the whole environment just seemed like we were bothering them by being there.  Every staff member we encountered was rude.  We sat outside on the patio which is dirty for being a restaurant especially.  Happy to go to many of the other locations but won't be returning to this one.

Took our mini dachshund in on Saturday for an emergency visit. Not only was the staff friendly and amazingly helpful, they got our guy back on his feet quickly.  Officially our go to vet and the only place we'll use. I've been avoiding finding a new vet because we've had some bad experiences but now that we've got a go to I'm so much more comfortable.

Was excited to try this place out and was bummed to leave disappointed. I had the spinach enchiladas and was happy until I hit the middle. They were cold and gummy which ruined the whole experience.   Food was a bit blah and service was incredibly slow.

My son is doing the Coyotes Kids First Hockey program here and its been a lot of fun. I remember learning t skate here when it first opened and it doesn't seem like a lot has been done since then. Over all it's clean and the staff is great but the place isn't anything spectacular.  I think we'll be continuing on with the Hockey Tots program because the coaches are really great with the kids and that is priority one.

The food is alright, it's Denny's.  My biggest problem with this place is the hostess.  She is loud and rude and sadly we were seated right next to the hostess table and I barely made it through breakfast. Our waitress was great, but I can't imagine having to deal with that hostess again, so we'll stay away.

Service is fantastic, always friendly.  I love the grilled veggie burro, and also the portabello and poblano taco!  My son loves the cheese quasadilla kids meal, it's sort of rolled like a cheesy burro which makes it easy for him to manage.  On our most recent trip my mom tried the grilled grande bowl and really enjoyed it, she said it was perfect for summer, not as heavy as a burro but very yummy.

Service is always great, I've been visiting this location for years.  Food is always great as well, I love the chicken avocado club, yesterday I tried the fish and chips and it was delicious.  I also love the drink menu, the pomegranate mojito is top notch.  My only complaint is when this place gets busy it seems to fall apart a bit up front.  Hostesses become distracted and spend more time talking to each other and trying to figure things out then getting people seated.

Stopped in for lunch today, it was fantastic!  I had the spinach and feta chimi because as a vegetarian I don't find a lot of meat free chimis out there.  This alone will bring me back to this place!  I am also anxious to try their other veg options.  Service was friendly and quick, price was great.  We had 3 entries and a kids meal for about $40 before tip.   Salsa is fantastic, but if you don't like a little zip or are sensitive to spice you might want to skip it.  I loved it though.

We stopped by on Saturday after going to the Burton Barr library.  My mom actually used to visit this place regularly when she was pregnant with me, she reports it's just as good now!  I was pleasently surprised to see the garden fajitas on the menu, they're so delicious.  They're made up of potatos, carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions also served with the usual, beans (not sure they're vegetarian, didn't eat them and didn't ask), rice, guacamole, and sour cream.  They were very yummy, they also have spinach enchiladas and a black bean and rice burro for the veggies. My mom had the seafood enchiladas, she raved about them, and my husband enjoyed the chicken fajitas which even at a lunch portion were huge.    Service was pretty good, atmosphere is nice, for being around 41 years they've kept it up well.  We'll be back when we're in the area.

I have been going to El Charro since I was in the womb!  This place is without a doubt a tradition.  The food is good, but not spectacular, the place is small and a bit dingy but like I said it's tradition.  Avoid the margaritas they are never good no matter how many times we try them.    I'm not sure I would take people here from out of town or to show them the great food of Phoenix by any means but my son will grow up with it just like I did, it's just yummy, inexpensive and tradition!

Great store!  Everyone there is very helpful.  We bought our sons bedding and crib there as well as a few odds and ends.  Will be back if we have another little one.  My only complaint is that moving my pregnant body around the store was a little hard because it's a little over crowded with stuff.

I stayed here for 2 nights last week while attending an event in the area. Living in the west valley I decided it would be nicer to stay on that side of town and enjoy the area.  I wish I hadn't.    The lobby is lovely the service from the front desk was great. Then I made the hike to my room which was incredibly disappointing. The whole place looks like a cheap apartment complex. I kept hoping that the inside of the room would be better and it was not. First of all I've stayed in MUCH nicer Best Westerns for less then my discounted room rate of $99. I have no idea who you found that was willing to pay the $289 rack rate you have posted on the door, this property shouldn't be charging anyone more then $60/night.  The patio furniture is easily 10 years old, the TV is probably closer to 15 years old, the mattress is hard and slumps in spots, and all of this is before we get to the amount of things that are just broken.  I had to pull on the elevator door to get it to close, and again to get it to open (I spent the remainder of my trip using the stairs). The door knob in the bathroom is coming off, the security lock on the sliding glass door is not screwed in all the way. Not to mention the fact that 2 of your maintenance employees pounded on my door at 11:30 and then tried to enter. Luckily I stopped them before they came in. Apparently they thought I had called about a tub issue.  IF I had just called wouldn't I have been there to open the door for you?   I ordered room service on night - it was bland, boring, and not properly prepared.  Cheap buffet quality food for a much higher price.  Needless to say that next year I will be staying somewhere else or making the commute.

Took advantage of a deal and went in and saw Brooklyn, without a doubt my new go to for a hair cut.  She was great, didn't rush me in and out, she was open to what I wanted but also offered suggestions.  From start to finish I was really happy with every step.  The location itself is a bit crowded since it's got a shop, and also a cafe in front but it's fun and nice to wait in an open area of the cafe instead of a waiting room.  The booths and suites are all rented so they are individual businesses.

Spent one night here and booked a private cabana for the day.  The pool was amazing, and the service was great. I wasn't impressed with the room though. The bathroom was amazing but totally disconnected from the rest of the room.   The beds are doubles and tiny. It's so strange to me that they seemed to be first class in every other place.   Food was good, we had some service by the pool and were pleasantly surprised and how tasty it was.  Not a perfect experience but super close.

I actually started seeing Suzanne many many years ago and she left the salon for a short time so after a several years of having to deal with terrible experiences, and ultimately removing my acrylics.  I was able to reconnect with Suzanne and am so happy. She is as wonderful as always and does a perfect job every time.  And above and beyond the wonderful service and product she provides she's an absolute joy to deal with!    Happy to be back at my manicure/pedicure home!

Not a fan of this location, I do think it's great they have Boca Burgers though.  I generally thing FatBurgers are great, and employees are nice but this one the employees are always so unpleasant.  And the food is simply not as good as the other locations.  This one is simply a disappointment.

Met a couple of friends here for an afternoon drink and a light bite and we had a great time. Service was really nice and the food was pretty good.  I must say I love the patio where you can sort of see a lot of Mill and when the weather is great (like it was the day we were there) I don't know why anyone would sit inside.  We'll be back for sure, honestly I don't think it's anything off the charts or unique but it's a great place to hang out from time to time.

Went in for a pedicure, decent job.  Nice and clean.  Prices are strange. FYI they charge extra for the scrub it's 5 bucks but I recommend it, felt great!  Nothing stands out as amazing but nothing was bad.  My mom went with me got a pedi and mani cuticals on nails were cut to short. Toe nails were cut really short to the point of hurting her.

Both 7 and 8 have broken or missing locks and 7 has an entire corner missing plexiglass in the top of the bed. Not worth the price if it's not maintained.    And yes these things have been mentioned to the staff numerous times.

I'm in the process of canceling this membership.  Price is not worth it.  Just a list of what I know about is currently wrong with beds  Bed 4 - 12-14 inch crack where you lay down.  Major safety concern (see photo) Bed 5 - Fan and face bulb control buttons have note not to touch  Bed 6 - Fan and face bulb controls is barely attached (this has been for the entity of my membership)  The broken areas I spoke about in my last update were broke 4-6 weeks before being repaired.    This is before we get to the disgustingly dirty floors.  There is about 6 inches between the wall and the foot of the bed and a little more then that between the wall and the head of the bed.  These areas are easy to get to with a broom and mop.  I know this because I've done it when I worked at a tanning salon in college.  I was told when I pointed it out today that it was impossible to clean so they didn't do it.  All they do is whip down the tanning surface.  When I asked to cancel my membership immediately I was told I'd have to call in on Saturday because that is the only time the owner is available.  I asked to leave a message for him to call me and was told and I quote, "You know he has a full time job right?".  Yes - I also have a business which I work a lot more then full time with so I understand.  And personally I'd rather have the number of the unhappy customer so that I can reach out immediately and have the solution handled.  I certainly don't want my staff undervaluing the time of an already unhappy customer.  This place is a simple case of you get what you pay for - it's cheap not affordable and not a great value.  I'll be happily paying somewhere else.  I am so sorry I let this run so long - I should have gone with my gut an canceled months ago.

Would not go back, not if you paid me.  Had a small tattoo done, check my pics to see it.  First emailed, when I didn't hear back, I called.  Guy who answered was rude, so I blew it off.  Finally got an email back, guy (Rick) seemed nice so went against my gut and did it.  HUGE mistake, I have a small touch up I'd like done (the word going is lighter then the rest of the tattoo) and he's unwilling to take a few minutes on a weekend to fix it.  Even though I'm totally unable to do a weekday.  So basically you're screwed unless as the customer you can fit yourself into his schedule.  Not to mention my initial appt was so lame, he didn't speak to me unless he was forced to, I have 5 tattoos before this one, from 2 different artists, and have met several tattoo artists over the years around the country, and I've never met any artist so unbelievably unfriendly!

After this I was finally able to get him to set up an appt to do the touch up.  I go today to have it done, detoured through the parking lot of Fry's to see him loading up his grocerys about 5 minutes before my appt is supposed to start.  I head to the studio and wait for about 10 minutes and he's a total no show.  Absolutely ridiculous, I wouldn't refer anyone to this place in fact if I would advise against it!

I had a full set of pink and white acrylics done, and Ann did a fantastic job.  My mom also came with me for a manicure and pedicure, she ended up getting only a pedicure.  There was quiet a line and she didn't want to take up too much time.  She enjoyed the young lady that did her pedicure as well.  I will absolutely be returning for a fill in a couple of weeks.

Went in for a fill a couple of weeks after my full set and last review and not happy.  Nails were all crooked and I have a terrible fill line in my pink which I've rarely had in the several years I've been having my nails done.  Asked Ann to level out my tips and they are still crooked.  Will not be returning, actually removed them and am on the search once again.

I've been to this ball park several times over the years and I'm impressed at how well it's keeping up.  I'm always impressed how clean it is, we were most recently out for Fan Fest '11 and again everyone was friendly and the place was spotless.    The only annoyance this time, and I know this is temporary was some construction, they are gearing up for the All Star Game. I just hope it's done by opening day.  I'd also love to mention for people looking to head out to a game, the price point for food is very reasonable.  Also there is something for everyone, I was really worried about vegetarian options when out last summer and had a FANTASTIC veggie burro from Macayo's.  And I know that several other vendors also offer vegetarian options.

The wait was a little longer then it needed to be since there were tons of opened tables.  The hostess asked the waitress on the way to our table if it was ok to sit us there and she was very bothered by it.  After that the service was TERRIABLE!  The food was alright, we had lunch the triple decker club and the ruben.  The potato salad was delicous!  prices were very reasonable in my opinion especially compared to the other casinos it came to 30 for both lunches and drinks.  The best part of this place is sitting on the "patio" where youa re in the casino so you feel like you're outdoors, especially if you enjoy the Paris.  I know most people don't really take kids to Vegas, but we were just on a quick day trip so we did have my son and there is no kids meal just as an FYI they do however have high-chairs.  Over all the place isn't a total loss but I think we'll try someplace else our next trip.

I love this place!  Lots of books, and friendly librarians can help you with whatever you need.  The new self check out machines are amazing you can put up to four books on the table and it checks them out all at once.  Especially helpful on a big trip :).  If you need a quiet place to work or study head upstairs to the fifth floor, tons of books, and even better desks with plugs so you can plug in your laptop and work.  Make sure you take a break and enjoy my sons favorite part the amazing views.  He loves to stand at the windows and see everything.

Absolutely one of the worst restaurants I've been too. I used to go to the location at Tatum and Cactus which I enjoyed quiet a bit. My son, husband, mother, and I stopped by for lunch on Labor Day. First off the place is tiny, the service is terrible, and the food is decent. It took forever to get any service at all, after which we were seated basically in the doorway, it's silly and uncomfortable. Next we ordered my sons kid meal was brought out about 15 minutes before the rest of our lunch. My mom had a white sangria cocktail which was basically just orange juice, which I have never actually seen anyone put orange juice in white sangria before. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich was basically plain chicken on a bun with a half a head of lettuce, tomato and onion..yep that is really all. The french fries were somehow both burned and undercooked...not sure how that even happens. Finally it came time to pay our bill it came to about $33 which is completely reasonable. I paid with a $50 and was brought my change entirely in ones. This to me is absolutely ridiculous and rude Also I saw the waiter use the money from his wallet (his tips I assume) to make the change which to me is totally unacceptable, you don't bring your wallet out at anytime you're handling customers cash.  Basically you could not pay me to return to this place.

They're redoing the showroom which was a bit of a shock when we got up there but other then that the Ikea I know and love is going strong.    My one complaint is that more then 2 registers need to be open on a Saturday morning.  I  understand that the self check out is open, but these are also for people with less then 15 items.  Some have more then that, for spending more with you we should not be forced to stand in one of the 2 lines for an incredible amount of time.  Also how about those two registers not be right next to each other.  It just makes the whole area seem even more congested.

In the years I've been enjoying the valley bar scene I've almost always avoided Mill avenue.  The exception to that rule is and always will be The Big Bang!  I love this place.  I hadn't been in a while but went back last weekend and remembered why I love this place so much.  Everyone you deal with that works there is super fun and nice.  The atmosphere is amazing, it forces you to not take yourself to seriously, just enjoy the night!  Drinks are tasty and reasonably priced in my opinion.  The entertainers are hands down amazing!  I had such a great time!

I love Hobby Lobby, it's got great stuff.  Also tons of different stuff, I'm a scrapbooker so I love the large selection they have.    The customer service left something to be desired.  I couldn't even get a your welcome when I said thank you at the check out.    I will be back though I can't resist all the great stuff they have!

It's been a very long time since I visited Claim Jumper, so we were excited to head over on Saturday.  We left disappointed though, the food was par at best and the service was slightly below par.  We had an eclectic dinner for my mom's birthday, I had the Margareta pizza which was alright, but I've certainly had better.  My mom had the macadamia nut mahi mahi and it was alright, the grilled veggies were so soaked in better or oil that they were almost uneatable.  I'm of the belief that if you have quality produce you don't need to soak them in butter after grilling and before serving.  My husband had the whiskey apple glazed chicken which was actually the best of our dinners but not over the top delicious just alright.  Skinny ritas are not to be missed, hands down the best part of our meal, skip the lemon drop though.  Also just a note for the bartender, I had the first cosmo I'd had in a while (just sounded yummy) and it was full of tiny pieces of lime, like lime pulp it was terrible.  At $9 I shouldn't have to strain my own cocktail.  We also order a piece of the huge chocolate cake for dessert (to take home) after a few hours we split it up, it's all sugar and no chocolate it seems.  We honestly threw most of it away.  Personally our money would have been spent better elsewhere and that's where it will be spent next time.

I love the Phoenix Public Market, we head down every Saturday morning to buy produce.  I agree with Matthew K, the first time I went we went later in the morning and the produce was not great.  Now we go first thing and are there at opening and we always get great fresh stuff.  We also have picked up yummy fresh bread, tortillas, and pasta.  All vendors have been friendly.  Warning the parking lot gets crowded fast, but again if you come early you can have your pick of treats and parking spaces!

Really disappointed by the damage. Doesn't seemed to be kept up well.  There was damage to a crawl through which could be SUPER dangerous. It looks like it was tapped off (and I remember it being tapped of last October when we were there) but it's not now. Plus the green is actually coming up on a few holes.   See Pictures  Several of the games in the arcade are beat up or completely broken.  Service was great though just wish the facilities were kept up better. I don't think we'll be back.

I love this mall, my favorite in the valley!  Great food in the food court, very bright and a ton of great stores!  I also love that there is so much around this mall, the whole area is full of shopping which is really nice.  It's a great place to find higher end stores without the obnoxiousness of Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I've found most of the service is friendly and the help desk is great.

I can say hands down I won't be returning.  We were able to enjoy the preview weekend offered for the new Fork & Screen features, and the best thing I can say about it was I'm glad it was free.  All in all we enjoyed 2 free movie tickets, as well as free dinner and soda.  When we arrived we were helped quickly by a friendly guy who helped us get our tickets and headed to the new bar in the lobby.  I order a pomegranate martini from the menu and was shocked with the $7.99 cost arrived in the smallest martini glass I've ever seen.  In addition to being outrageously priced, which on this instance wasn't too bad since I didn't pay for much else it was terrible.    Even though we'd been told to arrive very early we were unable to actually enter our theater until 30 minutes before show time (even though the theater had been empty for nearly 40 minutes before we were able to be seated).  Once seated we experienced how close together the seats were.  I spent most of my evening being kicked, which isn't the fault of the person behind me I'm guessing she had as much foot room as I did which was none once the seat is reclined back.  Not to mention the highlight I saw on the site was about the age restrictions.  The cinama seats, which are only a few of the theaters are 21+ but the Fork and Dine theaters which I was in are 18+ or with a parent. So we had the joy of a 2 year old squeeling most of the movie which the staff (which was numerous) did nothing about.    When the waiter who was friendly took our order and our food arrived about 20 minutes later.  The food was about on par price and quality wise of what you would get from Applebees or TGI Fridays.  We had the potato skins (it had been FOREVER and I was excited to be able to get them without the bacon), I had the margarita pizza, one of the few vegetarian options, which was very greasy. My husband had the chicken fajita wrap which is served with very plain potato chips.  All of it was alright, nothing terrible and nothing fantastic.  About an hour into the movie, as we'd been told, the waiter brought our check over.  Personally I think this is silly what if someone wants to order something else?  About 10 minutes later he comes by to pick up the check which we had not taken care of yet, after all we're watching a movie. He then told me he'd be back in a few minutes to pick it up then.  Personally this was the low point of the evening.  I handed the check to my husband, he took care of it and we simply left.  I hate being rushed out when eating at a normal restaurant but now you're going to interrupt my movie to pay a check when I could order more, and also you can't flip my table I'm going to be here for another hour watching the movie.  I simply couldn't stand to deal with any of it any longer.   Like I said at least it was free, we did the math and our total for the evening would have come to about $70.  Which the experience was no where near worth.  I'm old fashioned I guess, I'll stick to dinner and then a movie.

I wanted sculptured pink and white acrylics done, I called in the morning to confirm they were sculps not tips, I was assured they were so I made an appointment. About 10 minutes later the receptionist called to confirm they were sculptures.  I go to my appointment to find out they are not they are tips.    I was offered a free full set with tips, or a pedicure.  I opted for the pedicure.  All I can say is I'm glad I hadn't paid for it.  Especially since they charge $45 for this pedicure.    I went back for my full set today, it was alright.  She buffs them which I like, I was a little annoyed she was on her phone so much, it just made me use my phone more I guess.  Also the "smile line" is all crooked not pretty like it should be.  I might og back give it one more chance in the back fill but I haven't decided yet.  Absolutly wasn't worth the $50 bucks I was charged for a full set.

Been a fan for a long time.  It's inexpensive, quick, and delicious not a combo you always get.    I particularly enjoy the Giant Caramba's Burro, granted we generally spit it between three of us, and I also love the Giant Stuffed Quesadilla, again usually shared.  Also they have great grilled fish tacos.   A great family friendly laid back place to grab food and a margarita.

Not the worst place I've ever been but it's absolutely bad.  We had an oyster appetizer which was poorly shucked.  I had a shrimp and crab platter, crap was so so, not a lot of meat in it.  Grilled shrimp was very plain and nothing special, beer battered shrimp was good though I had a side of vegetables which were cold.  My mom was with me and she had the shrimp platter, which includes coconut shrimp which was pretty good, grilled shrimp again not so good.  And a shrimp pasta dish, which had the tails still attached which I've never seen before.  My son had a grilled cheese which came out cold and a side of cold fries.  Over all we won't be back it was very disappointing and there are just a lot more options out here that are a lot more satisfying.

A fantastic lunch, and my favorite was the amazing cocktail I enjoyed.  I cannot remember the name of it but it's the pomegranate drink under the martinis, not to be missed!    My husband enjoyed a steak and said it was really good, my mom loved her pecan trout, but she didn't love the slaw that comes with it.  My son enjoyed his Chicken tenders, they even come with a little package of two oreos!  The potatoes are delicious!!! Oh and the bread that comes at the beginning of your meal is really tasty as well.   I can't wait to try dessert next time.  Also service was AMAZING!  We will absolutely be back again and again!

Was in last week for a main/pedi.  They did a great job, there was no rush it was very relaxing and pleasant. I really loved the pedicure chairs, and also the basic pedicure is a fantastic deal and included everything I was looking for.  I would have liked a bit more variety in polish choices, but they have a pretty good selection of the standards.   I'll absolutely return!

We ordered pizza last night which is rare for us because delivery has become such a let down in the last few years, but I was feeling lazy and pizza sound delicious so we ordered from Barros and I was really impressed.  There are an amazing about of toppings I couldn't believe how heavy the box was when he handed me the pizza.  My only complaint is even with the vegetarian it's a bit greasy, but that's a personal preference I prefer my pizza be fairly grease free.  The delivery guy was less then happy, he seemed nice just like he might have been having a bad night, but was nothing but polite which is all I'm really looking for.  And when calling to order it they were very pleasant as well.  Took care of everything without fuss.

Spent a morning here working and connecting with a few friends and loved it. Coffee is great, service was friendly.  I think the place could use a little TLC as far as the furniture is concerned but nothing that would keep me away in the future. Looking forward to working here again in the future.

I've now tried Manny's twice...both times were equally terrible.  The food comes in at a decent price point but certainly not great.  Especially considering how hard it seems to be for them to get an order right, and or serve quality food.    I've had the fajitas, they were bland and boring.  There salsa is on par with the Pace you pick up at the grocery store.  We will not go back for a third try.

This store has the worst schedule ever.  They always seem to be doing stock on Saturday mornings around 8 or 9 which is really frustrating.   And no matter when I shop there is always stuff in the way and employees you must maneuver around.  Cashiers usually seem bothered by having to help me, and they really over stock bags when you bring reusable bags.

Will not go back, ever.  The trouble started when I booked the appt.  I didn't want to give my address to join the mailing list, this was apparently was a huge issue.  It should not EVER take 20 minutes to book an eyebrow wax appt.  Then I arrive 5 minutes early for a 1:00 and the women I had the appt with, Grace,  wasn't even there yet.  She finally arrived 5 minutes late and had to set up the room, this leads to another 5 minutes.  I had someplace else to be so finally I left.  Totally ridiculous.  If I had been 10 minutes late it would have been a big issue.  Real sick of a total lack of customer service around town lately!

Store is cute, they do have some cute stuff. But personally everything is very overpriced. Cheapest t-shirts were 26 bucks, also they don't seem to be a very good quality. I went because I won a gift card for doing a survey for there site. I was very disappointed to see I could only use it on a regular priced item, then say you're giving a coupon not a gift card. Overall I won't return, they did have some cute stuff, but I refuse to spend 26 bucks on a shirt my 10 month old will wear half a dozen times. There are some great stores online to find equally unique things for half the price.

Unfortunately a prime example of why it's tough to shop local.   My first visit was so so. Service left a lot to be desired, I mostly felt like I was interrupting when asking for help or checking out.  My second visit was worse. I needed to return a pen which I found totally dry when I got home. They however will not take pen returns (or exchanges which is what I wanted). Apparently there is a sign but my frustration comes down to having a fake return policy. I am not sure what's actually returnable.  I want to support this local place but I can't support attitude and lack of standing behind their merchandise. I'm sure I'll get some response about overhead and cost of running a business but the reality is that if you don't stand by it just say no returns and move on.

I had the Gyro Pita and it was delicious. My husband picked it up and brought it home, complained it was a bit slow but other then that clean. My only real complaint is the french fries were terrible! Tasted like they had been left over and re cooked to heat up. Will try again but not the fries!

This review is based totally on the food, I haven't actually eaten in the reasturant, we've always had it delievered with http://www.youbuyandwefly.com or picked it up.  But the food is good.  It's not the best mexican food in the valley but it's yummy.  The only thing I don't like is it's not really consistant.  Some nights the food is fantastic some times it's meh ok.  I order the fajitas a lot I love them and they aren't the least healthy thing on the menu lol.  Some nights the are full and yummy some nights it seems like a lunch portion or something becaue it's half of what I usually get (which for me is enough for two meals).

The only reason this place doesn't get one star is my husband and mom, said their food and I quote "wasn't terrible".  My food was terrible, mostly because it was cold.    When we arrived we were seated quickly, and a waiter came and took our drink orders. Biscuits arrived and they were tasty, we ordered.  This ends the positive points in this experience.  I ordered a baked potato stuffed with pulled pork and a salad on the side.  My salad was soaked in dressing, it was a lot more dressing then salad.  My potato was completely cold the cheese had hardened on top creating a shell holding the cold pulled pork in.  The potato also had 2 large (visible since I didn't eat this cold item) bad spots that went fairly deep into the potato.  When I let the waiter know that my meal was cold he looked at me like I committed a cardinal sin and didn't even hint at an apology.  My mom and husband both got BBQ combos, between the two of them every possible choice was ordered.  Both said food was "not terrible" mostly at least it was hot.  I decided to go for a walk around the District instead of watching them eat, since I now had zero interest in trying anything off the menu.  The manager came by and offered a free dessert.  When I came back she walked by twice and didn't once stop to offer an apology.  We were not charged for my meal (since I didn't eat it) but for two lunches ordered off the lunch menu our bill came to $40 which I think is high, especially considering the quality of food.   Topping off our lunch was the 20 minutes it took from when the waiter was handed our check until when it was brought back.  This is way too long, especially since the restaurant was not even busy.  Will not be back, and do not recommend.

When I first started using BB I was a huge fan, we got a ton of stuff and it was great, but what I noticed as weeks went on the excitement dulled.  We ended up tossing a lot because it was almost bad when we received it.    As a family of 4 it was disapointing to get 8 things of one item and then 1 of something else.  It's always an unknown or odd assortment because it's passed out among the baskets.  The best part was being pushed to cook new things, cooking veggies I'd never used before.  Personally I'd rather pick up from a farmers Market there are several great ones around, I still push myself to try new veggies but now we choose them, and how much of them.

Salsa and Guacamole are both delicious, hands down the best part!  I had the spinach enchiladas and they were great.  Note for vegetarians they do use lard in their refried beans so skip those.  My husband raved about his chicken fajita chimichanga, said it was fantastic.  The margaritas are not worth the price tag, but they are alright.  Service is ok, not quick but not bad, drinks stayed refilled, food came out perfectly hot and check was out when asked.  These days those things seem rare in the far west valley!

Love the convince without a doubt.  Prices can be strange but overall they are better then other stores on a lot of things, also when you see things on sale you can grab a deal!  We also love the pizza dough it's delicious and rises so nicely.  We always stop by the clearance area because you can often find some great things for dinner or dessert at a fabulous price.  Also sign up for e-mails and you can get even better coupons then what comes in the ad.

I love this location, and I love this product.    I think the prices are reasonable considering the quality of product you are getting.  If you've only been to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location and hate it, give this one a try.  It's got a much better vibe and is a lot less packed.    Walked right in was helped, she grabbed what I needed and I was off.  It took all of 15 minutes even with picking out a totally new foundation then I used before.

I agree with Raymond, place must be under new management because the service and food was amazing! My only complaint is the same as Nakama, which is in the same shopping center, I ordered Sushi, my husband ordered a cooked dish and my food came out about 10 minutes before my husbands and I really wish they would time it better, I think I'll request they bring them out together next time. We will absolutely be back!

One of my new favorite places!  I have been 3 or 4 times now, service was great with the exception of this last trip.  I particularly love that they don't shy away from spice.  They fully embrace it which is fantastic since most places make things a lot less spicy.  We've had a few different item's all portions are generous, even the lunch portions and I haven't had anything we didn't totally love!

Just wanted to add since I've become a vegetarian these guys have always been great with answering questions, or helping me remove the meat and make options vegetarian.  And they do have a few very good already vegetarian options on the menu!

If you want fresh produce hit a farmers market, if you want service go anywhere else.  The best thing is the amount of pre-made vegetarian options here, I love to pick up Amy's just to have on hand when they go on sale.  Produce goes bad so quickly and a lot of times I finding it sitting in the display already bad.  I often find moldy tomatoes and onions sitting there, last week it was strawberries.    I do love the amount of chemical free shampoos and cleaning products they offer though, also they carry a large selection of non-dairy milk.

We ordered it for delievery with http://www.youbuyandwefly.com.  It's resonably priced and very yummy.  We'll order again.  I can't comment on the actual location though because again we ordered delievery.  I had the hot and sour soup and it was delicous, we also ordered some sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, and chicken chow main it was all good!

Been here a couple of times now.  I love the sushi!  It's nice to have a nice sushi place on this side of town, a non-chain!    However the first time I went, my husband who is a non-sushi eater, ordered a cooked meal it came about 10 minutes after I finished my sushi!  Also the watress was very rude.  The second time we all ordered sushi so the timing wasn't off, but the service still sucked.  I will ofcourse continue to go because I love sushi and it's like 5 minutes away.  Also they deliver with youbuyandwefly.com, so you can't beat that!

After 75 reviews there is not a lot to add, but I must add this try the fruit salad with the watermelon, it will change your life!  It's so amazing!  Service here is always great, it doesn't matter if it's slow or packed they are always friendly and quick.

We went for Father's Day breakfast and were told there would be a 15 minute wait, I didn't believe this as she was saying it, I really didn't believe it almost 40 minutes later.  The food was pretty much not cold, the plates were hot though so I'm guessing they enjoyed some quality time under a warmer.  Service was slow and the food is really nothing special.  We might give it another try on a less busy morning.

I actually worked at this location in high school.  It's even where I met my husband (we worked there together).  We went back over the weekend to see Ides of March (which is great by the way) and were so disappointed to see what it has become.  First of all it says a lot that it was completely dead on a Saturday night.    I couldn't believe they'd closed off the entire east wing of the theater as well as the concession stand over in the west wing.  Granted they're not regularly open, it just looks tacky to have a fake wall and some game machines in front of it.  I came for a movie not a trip to the arcade.  There has clearly been a change in management since our last visit and since we worked there because this is not a theater worth heading to anymore.  Cold popcorn, service so bad that I had to remind them to get or soda, and charge my card and return it to me.  How about we don't take my card unless we're going to charge it and hand it to me?  No sitting on the counter while you figure out how to grab a soda and popcorn.

Stopped in for lunch while in the area and really enjoyed the food. Service was quick and easy. Great place to stop in for a fun family meal.   We were doing lunch so we split some appetizers, we did nachos and the tackle box, we could have easily done just one or the other but wanted some variety. It was fun bar food type of thing. I was excited because it was easy to option everything to be meat free (not always possible with bar food). No hassle to get it done, and everything was correct when it hit the table.   The kiddo had a kids burger and loved it. One word of warning HUGE portion sizes. I doubt I'd ever come in and not share so get friendly or get ready to take home leftovers.

Let me start by saying that by no fault of Texas Roadhouse I expected this to be horrible.  As a vegetarian when my grandmother suggested it I was expecting no choices, but after a quick glance at the online menu I saw they didn't forget the veggies!  Now the one vegetarian item on there dinner menu is a selection of 4 side dishes but that was more then enough for me.  I had the house salad (others are not vegetarian), a baked potato, veggies, and I ordered the fries as well for my son.  The veggies were surprisingly delicious I expected microwaved and covered in butter, not the case. They were yummy, the potato was good, not exceptional but I prefer Yukon golds to russets (just a personal preference). We also had the Baby Bloom to start and it was so yummy, the crust is light almost like a tempera batter then anything.  Very yummy.  Also the best part of your meal is free, don't miss out on the rolls!  Also I want to mention service was fantastic. My only issue was the pajama shorts our hostesses wore, but I think it was a 4th of July thing because they all wore red white and blue.  Not a huge issue just found it odd.    All in all I'd return if the family chose it, obviously I'm not there target audience but I'd be happily dragged along.

I've been to this location several times and I've never had anything but a great experience.  Service and food is always fantastic.  Check out happy hour, you can get some fantastic drink and food specials.  Last night we went for Happy Hour before heading over to see a movie, had the Margareta pizza (half off on Happy Hour special) it was delicious.  Service was quick and friendly and the outdoor area is super comfortable.  I especially love the outdoor lounge seating, not just tables.  It's nice when you're just grabbing some drinks with friends to not have to sit at a dining table.  The beer selection is amazing, but so is the rest of the menu.  Also they have an entire vegetarian section of the menu now which is great, my only complaint (which is a preference thing more then anything) is that I wish they didn't all contain Gardin products, I wish a few of those items were just veggie items.  But you can also find meatless options in other portions of the menu.

Currently having a liquidation sale, but it's not really worth the trip.  I found that most books were cheaper at Amazon then the sale price.  A few were even cheaper at Barnes and Noble then the liquidation sale price!  Which just made me say to myself well that's probably why you're going out of business try some competitive pricing!  The place is an absolute disaster they've moved a lot so the sales staff doesn't even know where everything is.  Also the place just smells dirty and old, it's very unwelcoming.  It's really no surprise to me they couldn't get customers before.

I'm a huge fan of the veggie burro it's got these super yummy mushrooms in it!  They also have a great mushroom and pepper taco.  Always happy to see places with some vegetarian representation!      Service is always quick and friendly even when it's packed.    You'll definitely pay a little more then regular fast food, but this like Chipotle is so much better then regular fast food.

I had to actually calm down for a few days before I wrote this.  I decided to take advantage of the free blow out deal they were doing before the Yelp Ten Chimneys event.  BIG mistake, I left looking worse then when I went in!  In the process of washing my hair, my head was bounced against the shampoo bowl repeatedly, I was then repeatedly hit in the head with both the blow dryer and the brush.  I've never in my whole life of getting my hair done, been hit so many times collectively!  I left with such a headache, plus had to come home and totally re-wash and blow dry my hair!  This women spent the entire time trying to sell me on a hair cut, and since she couldn't control a blow dryer I'm certainly not allowing her to have scissors near my head.  I'll stick with my current stylist, and stay clear of the salon portion of this Ulta.  Especially since this women wants to charge me more then my stylist does at an upscale salon in Old Town Scottsdale!  I also noticed this visit that most of the staff, salon as well as store staff spent most of the hourish I was there between shopping and my appointment chatting with each other.  The polish choices over in the salon polish displays (OPI, China Glaze, Essy) were almost totally out of stock and this seemed strange for a Thursday.  I may run to this location in the future for a necessity when I don't have time to get to another location, but I'll avoid it if possible.

I had walked by this place a few times and kept meaning to go in but hadn't had the chance. On Sunday we found out they are one of the few places open for breakfast right there on Sundays (seems a few of the other popular breakfast spots are closed on Sunday.  I was a little hesitant about an Irish bar for breakfast but it was fantastic.  Service was great, food was yummy and reasonably priced. I'll be back for sure.

Went in for a massage, left a bit disappointed. Receptionist was very nice, front is clean. Went back to the relaxation room to finish my wait and was greeted by the massage therapist who was very nice. The massage rooms are large however there was a disgusting dirty bathmat next to the bed and the awful ceiling lights are terrible especially once I flipped to my back. Overall I left feeling like I'd been lotioned up but no relaxation. She was able to relieve some of the tension in the small of my back, I had mentioned that the true focus needed to be my shoulders and neck since I had a lot of pain there due to stress. She barely touched my shoulders and with the pain caused by releasing the bit of tension in the small of my back I left with more pain in my neck and shoulders.  Overall I don't think I'll be back, I've was searching for somewhere to start a membership with but I've had better experiences elsewhere.

I just want to update in response to the "owners" note. This in fact is a legit review, I visited the spa in March and had this exact experience and if your records do not reflect that you have yet another issue.  Just as a lesson I would encourage you to reach out and try to answer issues politely, all in all this isn't a horrible review, I likely would have given it another chance. Now though you've made the matter worse and my decision will never change and I will absolutely not be returning.  One last update, if I'm not in your system why did you email me a birthday special this month? Oh and this is after I've opted out of your mailing list.  All around bad business happening at this place. AVOID!

We've been here 3 or 4 times and the service is generally a bit above average but never amazing.  Food is always good.  I most often just get salad and bread sticks if we're in for lunch but if we're in for dinner I'll get the fettuccine alfredo or the portabello ravioli, the ravioli is my favorite I absolutely love it.  My mom had the muscles which are on the featured items menu and she said they were amazing.  My husband had the featured cheese ravioli with carbonara sauce and chicken...said it was amazing! Overall I'd say this is one of the few consistently good places on the west side.  I do wish they had a vegetarian soup option, I loved the soups when I ate meat and it would be great to enjoy them again.

Love the facility, we grabbed some grass seats and even found a bit of shade.  The parking is free which is great, and we paid $13 for lawn seats but I think it's because the Diamondbacks were there (a lot of the parks charge a premium when the Dbacks play).  We grabbed some hot dogs that were delicious.  There are a ton of vendors all priced on par for the other parks for Spring Training.  Free parking is awesome but I wish it was set up a bit better.  The lot is really a mess so it's hard to get around.   Also I want to remind who ever books the national anthem singer, the national anthem is not a joke and should be treated with respect...ALWAYS.

Let me just say that my waxer Carrie gets 5 stars!  She is amazing, I've seen her twice now and I will never ever see anyone else there.  She makes me feel totally comfertable and relaxed.  I'm even going to venture to a brazilion which I've wanted for a while but been afraid of because she's amazing!  As a whole I love this place the prices are geat and the service for the most part is wonderful.  I go with my mom and this last time she was with Michelle, who was lets say less then a delight!  She was rude, didn't talk at all, just in general seemed bothered by the appointment.   Also a note for the front desk, you've told me about your programs, I'm going to go home look at them see which works best for me since I'm thinking about adding some services, which I've told you.  You really don't need to harrass me about your programs 5 and 6 times it's rediculous.  Over all a great salon, quality customer service just a few tips!

I went again last week for an appointment and I really don't think I'll be returning. Again I love Carrie she is wonderful but the front desk is annoying. Once again I was asked several times if I want a package again I said no, because with the services I get I don't save any money in fact if I miss even one appointment time I actually lose money because I pre-pay the packages. I asked her to not ask again and she said they all have to ask or they will get in trouble. It's ridiculous. I won't be returning, because I have no interest in setting myself up to be annoyed every four weeks!

We stopped by for our first experience of Indian food a little more then a week ago.  There was only my husband and I and one other couple in the whole place.  The one waiter spent the entire time talking to the other couple.  We ordered drinks that we never actually received.  At the suggestion of our waiter who was friendly in the few minutes he actually spent speaking with us, we had the buffet. It seemed very very bland.  I was really excited to try Indian food because I'd heard such wonderful things about the flavors.  We will be trying Indian food again, but never from here.

Great place, and great prices.  They have something for everyone on the menu and the portions are fabulous.  Lots of options for everyone to choose from.  One thing I love that a lot of places don't do is when it's listed as spicy it is spicy!  Everything is flavorful and delicious, we've only done take out so far but the service is always fabulous which I find with take out is sometimes forgotten.

We were so lucky to get last minute appointments for Saturday morning, my mom and I were even able to get in at the same time.    She saw Sam, who she raved about and did a wonderful job on her hair.  I saw Emily who was also great.  The highlight was the scalp massage during the shampoo, I seriously almost fell asleep in the chair!  Aside from that even during the cut and style she has a great touch, no pulling, no tugging.  It was a very relaxing experience and I ended up with exactly what I requested.  She is a big quiet, but I didn't mind that at all just let me relax.  Overall the salon is very clean and friendly, the stylists are all talking to their clients not each other which I loved.  I hate feeling like I'm in the middle of someone else's conversation.    I'll absolutely go back, it's great to find a wonderful salon like this in the west valley.

Our family has used them twice now. And I was pleasantly surprised both times. We've had Dawn as our photographer both times, we actually requested her the second time. She is amazing. Everyone there is great about keeping our little one smiling and getting some great shots. Also you get a lot for your money. And the shots are a little more creative then they would be at Sears, Penny's or something similar. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.    You can see some of the photos in my profile by the way.

Enjoyed Blu Burger for the first time today.  Service in one word was AMAZING!  Haven't had such wonderful service in years!  Food was fantastic, they were down one cook so it was a little slower so they brought us out some french fries to hold us over.  Food is very well priced ohh and the sweet potato fries are some of the best I've ever had.

I love this place still!  It's amazing and for they have a delicious portobella burger and some very yummy salads!  Service was once again great, and I'm happy to see some place so consistently good in the west valley that seems to be hard to find out here.

The bathroom is disgusting, it should be check on regularly, especially when there are 3 of you working an no one actually doing anything and you're not busy.  As far as service and product, it's Starbucks.

Stopped in for drinks and chatting with a few of my best ladies.  The blood orange martini is fantastic!  I loved the patio, it was so nice to chat and enjoy the weather with some great drinks and wonderful service.  We also had the sweet potato fries and quickly realized why all of the tables around us also had them - they're awesome!  We'll definitely be back - I'm not sure I'd love it in the summer because that patio is amazing and I just wouldn't want to sit inside but I can see it easy to be a regular from September to May!

This is one of those places I'd wished I'd visited sooner. I finally decided to stop by after getting my hair done and was really pleasently suprised. I had the French Philly sandwhich and it was awesome! Also it was ladies night (Wednesday) and they had 99 cent domestic drafts which is always a win in my book.  We'll absolutely be back, I'd love to check out one of the live music nights.

Went in on my continual search for a consistently good nail salon and had a great first time.  I had a full set of pink and whites and am very pleased.  I'm anxious to go back for a back fill and hope that this continues since the second and third appointments seem to be where it's all falling off for me lately.  Anyways back to business salon is nice and very clean.  I do wish employees were easier to understand but that's not a huge issue for me.  I look forward to going back and checking out the pedicures, they have a large amount of pedicure chairs, nail stations, and employees which was nice because even on a busy Friday afternoon I had no wait.  Those that came in behind I saw had a short wait but no one longer then a few minutes.  But even with all of that the current clients don't feel rushed.  And you don't feel like you're on the clock.  Salon is neat and comfortable which is a plus in this summer heat.

They did a great job at a great price - the only issue was they came a day before we had it scheduled.  Which isn't a HUGE issue, but was a bit surprising and held me up a bit.  They were also VERY quick to get it done so it wasn't bad.  We'll use them again.

I always get 5 star service here.  I'm most often there when I stop by and get a coffee on the way to the farmers market early Saturday mornings and it's almost always busy!  Luckly, busy doesn't seem to matter the employees always have a smile and are ready for a quick chat while you order or wait.  This location does seem to be a few cents more then others though, even the one just down the street near Target is almost a buck less with 2 coffees.

I like this store, I think I enjoy it mostly because it's also attached to a Toys R Us which we tend to use more these days.  The store is clean but the customer service is simply not there.  And in reality you'll find almost anything in the store at a lower price somewhere else.

Customer service can occasionally leave a little to be desired but usually everyone is wonderful.  I find the best times to go is when there is a great sale, so stay tuned for coupons and ads because you can really save a bunch.    Fabric department is generally pretty knowledgeable and able to help with questions.

Sadly when I reviewed before and said generally the employees were nice is no longer true.  In fact while having fabric cut today, we went a head and took the rest of the bolt, I had to ask about the normal 50% discount and was told I hadn't asked for the fabric correctly.  I apparently have to pretend I want less and then let them throw on the extra...Very odd.  In my opinion if the bolt ends I get the discount simple as that.  The one women cutting fabric also spent a good 15 minutes chatting with the customer in front of us (a regular it seemed) while we stood and waited.  I really wish we had more fabric options out here.

Let me start with the fact that I love Old Navy, over the years I've been able to find some great deals.    My problem with this Old Navy is customer service.  I had an employee complain to be about organizing racks, when I talked to the manager I was offered, and I quote "$5 appeasement bucks".  Basically there strategy is to give me $5 to shut up, not a good customer service plan Old Navy.

We've been in a few times, service is usually subpar at best.  Stock is iffy, your best bet is to stay out front and check the sales. If nothing good then head out.

I've only seen Misty (nail tech) and she is fantastic!  The location is nice, front desk person is really sweet and on the ball. Salon is clean and friendly, everyone I've interacted with has been really nice and the clients all leave looking great.   I'll absolutely continue to see Misty.

Great service, solid choice for a good meal.   I know it's a burger place but I love the fish and chips as well. Fries are fantastic and endless but I only have wanted more when I split a burger with someone you really get plenty with your meal.  Service has always been wonderful, never anything less then completely friendly and helpful.

The gym is 5 stars in my opinion, I've had no problem with the gym at all I love the facility and the staff is great.  I'll be sure to update after a personal training session.  But signing up has been a breeze.  Take advantage of the 7 day pass it's no pressure and the facility really sells itself and they seem to know that.  Been there at different times of day, even when it's busy you don't feel like you're on top of each other there is plenty of equipment and facility is kept very clean.  I enjoy the sauna and the steam in the locker rooms as well a nice way to unwind after a work out.  The Lifespa inside is another story, I had a terrible experience with the a manicure and pedicure that left me feeling not only insulted but overcharged.    Check out the gym, skip the spa!

I've now been with Lifetime for a few months, and still no complaints.  I think the evening employees could be a bit friendly.  I definitely prefer the day time front desk staff but aside from that it's great.  I had one rude locker room attendant but it seemed like she was just having a rough night in general.    I won't argue that this gym is pricey, but I've been to the lower price point gyms and the cost difference is evident in the atmosphere and the machines available. My son is taking one of the kids classes now and loves it.  I would have no problem recommending this gym to anyone.

Tuesday Morning stores much like Ross and other stores are hit or miss.  This is not my favorite one, it's small and cramped.  We looked around and found nothing of value much less a good deal.  I prefer the one in Mesa for sure.

So far we've only picked it up and brought it home but it's fantastic food.  The service for pickup has always been great.  Food is good, only disappointment is the salad, but really the pizza should be your focus, it's amazing!  I'm looking forward to trying a few more things on their menu.

Great place, I love that they have a veggie bowl option.  Make sure when you order it though you specify that you want sauce on it otherwise it just comes out with veggies and rice.  Service is always quick and friendly and the price is great.

Service is friendly, pancakes are great.  I had the veggie omelet, and it was alright, really nothing special.  It does come with home fries cooked in bacon, which would have been nice to know.  I only found out because I notice the bacon in my home fries.  Small menu, not a lot of choices, only one lunch vegetarian option.  I probably won't be back, but I wouldn't avoid the place.

We had visited a few times before my last review and 2 times since that review and it has only become worse.  Drinks, food, service all terrible.  The worst thing for me is when you bring up an issue they seem offended that you dare suggest it's not perfect.  For example a margarita with no tequila or a cold appetizer (We've had both happen).  We won't be returning.

This review is of the salon and of Brooklyn Byers who rents a station in the salon.  The salon is actually very nice, a bit small but comfortable and I like that it's not super noisy.  I've only ever seen 3 stylists there and they were all about as friendly as they needed to be.  Brooklyn is the stylist I've seen a few times now.  The first time I saw here she did a good job, it was just a basic cut.  The next time again was just a trim so it was fine.  This time I saw her for a pretty big chop off and some color.  The cut was fine, not great, not horrible.  The color has been a total nightmare.  I had some purple foiled in underneath, it's not solid but there is a fair amount of it all around my head.  When leaving the salon after my appointment I realized it was not only blue but really streaky.  She had bleached my hair first then applied the color.  I went in a week later for a touch up and this time left purple and solid.  After only 3 washes (with color safe shampoo and in cold water which she recommended and in 7 years of having my hair colored I've never heard of) it's back to streaky.  It's slightly more purple then it was when first done but full of streaks.  Nothing is more frustrating then a stylists who says they can do something no problem and then fails to deliver.   My other major frustration is the length of time it takes to get a service.  For my touch up last Saturday I was there for 4 hours.  That's ridiculous, not to mention the fact that she booked a simple hair cut in the middle of my appointment that took her 90 minutes!  I would not go back to Brooklyn and cannot recommend her to anyone.

The least painful part of my wedding was the visit to Janet.  I bought my wedding dress on final clearance, only problem was it was 2 sizes too small.  Not a big deal since I wanted a corset back added anyway, I was mostly stressed about the cost of redoing it.  Janet made it not only a painless experience she was wonderful and kind and I actually enjoyed my fittings.  I ended up with the dress I dreamed of for about $700 (cost of dress and alterations) not bad for a semi custom dressed or for even just the original dress which held an original retail price of north of $2000!   I have and will continue to send everyone I know to Janet Kirkman.  She is amazing!

We've been several times, it started out great I love the vegetarian sub, much better then Subway! In the last couple of visits quality and service have both gone to nothing.  I'm really sick of annoying restaurants skimping on veggies when you order a vegetarian something.  I'm guessing they don't skimp on ham if you order a ham sandwich!  Not sure we'll be back.

I can't believe it took us so long to try Oregano's.  We stopped by after our Ikea trip on Saturday and had some seriously delicious food.  We started with the garlic bread and marinara, very yummy but I really wish it came out cut.  I ordered the Bistro Classic pizza which was amazing, the tomatoes were plentiful and delicious. The rest of the family ordered the lasagna and the Italian sausage sandwich (Jr size), both were raved about.  Serving sizes are huge, we'll do more sharing next time without a doubt.  Also prices are very reasonable.  I was shocked to see our bill come out to under $50, I hadn't really paid attention to the prices when ordering and just expected it to be around $60.  Service left a bit to be desired but it was alright, and it's really loud in there, which I didn't love.

Suzanne is both a talented and wonderful nail tech and a joy to deal with!  I've enjoyed having my acrylics done by her for years and they are always exactly what I want!  Her pedicure is not to be missed.  She is so fun to talk to during your appointment, I always enjoy my little break with her every couple of weeks.  I can go in and just relax and chat for a while which as a mom and a business owner is like a mini vacation!    Also it's worth mentioning she is also extremely talented in natural nail care if acrylics are not your thing.  I always enjoy seeing the manicures and pedicures of the clients leaving as I'm coming in.

We grabbed lunch to go last week and it was great.  Lots of vegetarian options on their menu.  I had the Vegetarian Burro with a cilantro tomatillo sauce on it that was amazing.  My husband ordered the chicken burro with traditional enchilada sauce and said it was great.  My son who ate free because he's under 5 had a really great quasadilla kids meal with rice, beans and a drink.  Our entire meal came to about $12!    We'll be back for sure, it's a better and less expensive option then Rubios or Baja Fresh which it's the most similar too.  If you're looking for quick, tasty, and inexpensive this is your best bet in the area.

Very very very very disappointed.  I'm a big fan of Carlos O'Brien's and was excited to see them come out here.  We finally made a visit last week, and I wish I hadn't.    First we should have left when we walked in, the atmosphere feels more like a school cafeteria then a restaurant.  Chips were alright, salsa was straight from the Pace Picante jar.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas which I was told came with black beans (arrived with refried beans that were overcooked around the edges from sitting under a heat lamp.  Not that I planned to eat them anyway, I wanted the black beans but the sight was disgusting. It was enough to distract me momentary from the dirty plate though.  And about the enchilada, I couldn't actually locate them on my plate there was a large pile of what appeared to be spinach queso but no tortillas (a key part of enchiladas for those unclear).   The rest of my party had chimichangas, one chicken fajita and one green chili, I was told both were "alright" neither were finished.   I complained to the waitress about mine, the manager was sent over and barely spoke English and seemed to have no idea how to handle an unhappy customer (something I think he should get used to) the item was removed. As it should be since it wasn't eaten.    We won't go back, between bad service,bad food, and bad ambiance it's lucky it gets the star.

One of the most terrible restaurant experiences I've had from start to finish.  To complain about the service would imply there had been some.  We stopped by a bit before they opened.  They looked at us talked to each other then when we walked up told us they were not yet opened.  How about if you're not open, let me know when I walk in, or keep the door locked.  We left and returned a few minutes later when they were open.  There was no hostess at the table, but there was a manager and 3 waitresses too busy talking to seat us.  About 3 or 4 minutes later the manager finally told a waitress to seat us.  The food is frozen, the best thing I can say for it is that it's warm.  The soup of the day was a "broccoli cheddar" it was pretty much Velveeta with raw broccoli dropped in.  Like the old place that was in this spot, the best aspect is the fish tank in the restaurant, now it's not even worth that.  This will be our final trip to both this zoo (which I'll review shortly) and this restaurant.

After a few months of membership I'm in love.  Service has been fantastic since my initial issue and Susan is still amazing.    I'd highly recommend it if you're in the area and looking for a message, either just once or a membership.  It's a great value and I have found it to be a wise investment for myself.

Fabulous donuts, great prices, friendly service - this place rocks!  I'm so happy that we have some place like this in the west valley now. I'd much rather support this delicious fabulous local business then a huge ok franchise.  Selection is great and they were just as delicious when we broke into them the next morning then they were when we bought them.    We will be back!

Visited with a girl friend a few weeks ago for the first time and cannot wait to go back. Great selection of beers on tap, wanted to try something different so the waiter brought over a sample, loved it and ordered. So nice to be able to taste it first.  Fish tacos were AMAZING, as is the grilled cheese.   Will be back for sure.  Only complaint is parking, and that's really a location issue in Downtown, park and walk, it's worth it.

Great Sunday breakfast. We enjoyed a rainy morning on the patio and left very happy. I enjoyed the Eggs Benedict with the spicy sauce, very good. Husband enjoyed the pancakes a lot as well and so did my son. My mom ordered the southwest omelet that have me a bit of breakfast envy. It was so yummy.   The service could use a bit more attention but it's not terrible.

Stopped in with the family before I flew up to Vegas and was really disappointed. I stopped in because this is one of those places I really wanted to check out but I wish I'd stuck with the actual restaurant. It really doesn't translate well to airport.   Food was so so at the very best. Service was slow and seemed inconvenienced.

We've only grabbed it to go which in my opinion is the better option, you don't have a ton of space.    Burgers were delicious, definitely living up to the hype I've heard from others.  Price point isn't too bad and serving sizes are generous.  We have a family of 4 and split 2 orders of fries with plenty left over.  It will probably replace In and Out as our go to burger place near the house.

The first time we went in was fantastic, I decided to get a gel manicure, my mom was with and got the same thing.  It was quick, they had a great color selection and very friendly.  When we returned 3 weeks later it was a total 180.    We walked in and everyone was busy, Andy told us it would be 10 minutes.  About 10 minutes later he sets up acetone for my mom to remove her gel manicure (still nothing for me who also needed to remove a gel manicure).  30 minutes later after being totally ignored and my mom's fingers getting ready to melt off we decided to leave.  She washed up and we walked out. About a minute later Andy chases us down and says he's ready.  He was still midway through a back-fill when we left so I doubt he was ready.  It was very disappointing and we won't return.

One disappointing moment after another.   Starting with putting our name on the list had to confirm 3 times we were a party of 4. We get called and the hostess tried to sit us at a table for two. We are left standing there waiting while she figures it out.   We get a table make our drink orders. My husband orders a soda and he's brought a coffee. Not a big deal but a big sign of what's ahead. Soda refills came easily but had to pretty much beg for a coffee refill.  Next up we order breakfast and it arrives and my 6 year old son's order was wrong. Something that should be fixed very quickly instead took about 20 minutes for his correct order to come out. But to make it better our waiter comes over 3 times to say it's not his fault and the manager tells us it's delayed because she had people not want to come to work because of the PF Chang marathon. None of this is my problem.  The rest of us had correct orders but none of it was hot. Not a single thing that hit out table was warm.   We won't be back.

Get the pookie!!! No seriously - go right now. It's yummy.  We just happened to see one of the owners on Channel 3 news and decided to head over for lunch. So glad we did!  Service was top of the line and food was great!  Not to mention the joy of being able to feed 3 adults and a kid for under $30. The price is fantastic,  not crazy $2 charge per topping, it's one price add what you like and enjoy.  We will without a doubt be back!

I used to enjoy Jamba Juice regularly but in recent years after less then steller service at a few I stopped.  But a few weeks ago when the first heat wave hit I was craving a yummy smoothie as we were out and about so we tried this location.  It was fantastic.  We had our 2 year old with us so they gave us a water cup so I could share my smoothie with him (came with a lid and she even cut a straw down to length for him).  I wanted a combo of 2 smoothies so they took care of it no problem Glad this location is so near home because we'll be visiting more often especially in the summer heat!

Total disappointment, most venders mentioned weren't there. After selling a sample bundle many vendors didn't do samples.   Staff and trucks were rude and we couldn't get waters anywhere.   Requesting a full refund.
