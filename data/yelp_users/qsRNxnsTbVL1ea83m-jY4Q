Always looking for a great place to eat breakfast, and we have found it!  We had the Breakfast Burrito wiith chorizo.  It was wrapped tightly as it should be so that you can cut it open or eat by hand without any dripping.  The Belgium waffle with apples was amazing.  It  did not have the typical compote that you would see.  They were dry but what a flavor it packed!  Absolutely delicious. the portions were perfect if not a bit larger than what we expected. It felt like it was a family oriented restaurant and very comfortable.  A place that we will visit again!

I read the reviews and still ended up going to this place.. I went in for a manicure only as I thought their prices were too high for anything else. The guy who was doing my nails, did not know how to take gel polish off.  The female worker next to him had to show him how to wrap my nails in aluminum foil, and then show him how to use the tool to get the old polish off.  I should have known at that moment, my gut said run and run fast.  But I stayed to see how it would end.  I chose my color, the guy kept wiping the brush off so that he would use only the most minimal of color on my nails (not what I wanted as I have had this color before and it should look better than clear polish on my nails).  He did not coat down to the cuticle either, he left a huge gap.  When I informed him that my nails needed to stay under the light longer than 30 seconds he argued with me.  I know that they have to be under the light for a minimum of 2 minutes (experience).  And when I told him he will have to put on a 3rd coat, he called to the female (who was helping him before) to come over and talk to me.  She did, and she ended up putting on the additional coats of polish, fixing his mistakes and being frustrated with me. When I paid, the femaile did give me a card and printed on the back that I would get $5.00 off my next visit.  I don't think going back and having a discount is worth the next visit.  I will not be going here again for sure.

I just loved this place!  If you like Calamari you will love theirs!  They are huge and taste fabulous, like nowhere else I have ever been!  the Salmon burger just melts in your mouth and the Kiltlifter brew is not be missed.  With its pub type atmosphere this is for sure a place not to be missed in Tempe.  We will be back often.

Went to breakfast this morning with my husband.  The parking was fine, there seemed to be plenty.  When you walk in, it is a quaint, rustic restaurant.  When we go to have breakfast out, we really want a good cup of coffee.  The coffee came and it was very weak.  When we mentioned this to the server she asked if we wanted a cup of the "double" coffee.  We said if it was stronger than yes.  It was not much stronger than the weak cup.  Where the coffee was not exactly desirable the food was!  They make their own Chirizo and Salsa.  My husband had the Eggs Maximilian with Chorizo added and was sweating from the heat of the food.  My food was the traditional eggs and bacon.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon, not over or under done.   Well Done Harlows!

this place is so darn cute!  You might miss it if you are driving too fast.  The food is like nothing I have ever experienced.  I had the pot pie, mmmm was that tasty.  All of the chicken and veggies are wrapped up in a pie type crust with the gravy on the side for dipping.  I have never enjoyed a pot pie as much as this one.  The only thing that was slightly off, was the lighting is very dark and the portions are small.  With that said, the portions being small left us room for dessert.  The dessert was out of this world!  You cannot go wrong with any of their items on the menu! I will be back for lunch for sure, and will bring visitors to this location too!

Butcher Hook is not just a store. It is a restaurant also.  Most people who frequent Roosevelt know and enjoy a good home cooked meal here.  While it is not glamorous it does make you forget about the hustle and bustle of city life.  The servers are very pleasant, the food portions are good.  More typical of a diner type restaurant.  Remember where you are, and if you are camping or boating on your way back to the big city, or just there for the evening, this is a quiet little neighborhood type of a place.

I have visited this location twice in the past month.  I will be honest, I only buy the #13 because it is the closest to the taste of a sub from Jersey.  add the salt, pepper and oregano and I think I was back in Jersey eating at a sub shop there. The meat is freshly cut, the bread (you don't get choices back in Jersey at a sub shop so wheat or white was fine by me) was nice and crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The employees were very nice both times, same crew.  In fact they remembered who I was from a few weeks back and held a great conversation with me.  In fact they were just as friendly to another repeat consumer who came in after me.  Overall, the staff was very courteous and the sub was great. i will be back for more.

While the service was a bit slow, it is worth going to DC Steak House for the food in itself.  It took us 2 1/2 hours from start to finish.  Partly because the staff was elusive and not attentive when we needed them to be.  The restaurant on the other hand should be commended for how clean it is. So clean that the bartenders even smell the glasses before pouring any liquids into them.  That says a lot about the care they take with their patrons.  The food was awesome!  I had a "medium" 6 ounce filet mignon that cut like butter.  The baked potato was your average potato nothing wrong, nothing great, just average. Mushrooms are included with their steak preparation.  I do not eat any mushrooms and found it quite easy to maneuver around them so they did not get in my way.  By the way, they do not make soups, so please do not ask then what the soup of the day is.  Their dessert was outstanding!  I had the tiramisu which I could tell was made with real cream that makes such a difference.   Overall if you are looking for great food, this is where you would want to go.
