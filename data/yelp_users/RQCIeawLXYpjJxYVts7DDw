Only had soup and salad and it is hard to mess it up but the soup (lentil) was delicious and most importantly it was hot. The house salad was adaquate.  Service was friendly and timely. I would recommend this bistro for its price and food

The turkey panini was delicious and the service was good.  It also helped that Walt Richardson was performing. All and all a great treat.

I have eaten at Michael's Several times, first when it was located in the old Barbary Coast and then at the South Coast. Having liked the old Vegas feel at the Barbary I was pleasantly surprised to find the same ambiance at the South Coast.  The price is steep but the food is always prepared correctly and the portions are generous.  I have had a waiter named Tim on 3 or 4 occasions and he and the rest of the wait staff is the best in town.  If in season I would suggest the stone crab as it is delicious.  'nuf said.

I was so sad to hear about the closing of Alex's in the Wynn.  This was the best high end French restaurant in Las Vegas.  The wine list alone was worthy of a visit and as I say on my site I would want my last meal to be the braised short ribs served at this elegant restaurant.  One small story about the service.  My wife and I were dining and the glasses they served with a $100 bottle of pinot noir were lacking.  I mentioned that to our server and within a minute the sommelier was at our table with two of the finest  wine glasses I had ever had the pleasure to drink from.  It is a shame that the downturn in the economy affected this great treasure.  'nuf said.

Trendy boutique setting. Drinks were great although a little pricey. Service was great and the views were outstanding.

Nice tv's food is mediocre at best. Their famous zipp burger was too well done. Our server was really good and the only positive. Would not recommend.
