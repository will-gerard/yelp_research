HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Although the food was quite delicious. I ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, edamame and a spicy salmon roll. The total came to 18.00 even. I left 24 dollars on the table. When I left, as I approached my car, the waitress chased after me and stated "WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SERIVCE?!" Puzzled, I politely responded "no, why?" And this rude ass said "Because I thought you would have tipped more"  ARE YOU JOKING ME? That is so rude and I almost wanted to tell her to give me my 6 dollars tip back because shoot, I could put that in my gas tank lady.   Good food but not good enough for me to come back. Sayonara.

It sucks giving this location one star because I really do like Walmart. But lately this store has been like creeper central. I came here one night just for some shampoo and conditioner. It had to be about 10pm and I was alone, however, there were a lot of people in the parking lot. As I walk into the store, there are like 6 homeless people sleeping in that little front area near the shopping carts. Why aren't any employees monitoring this!? And after I get my shampoo, I'm in the self checkout and some ladies kid starts throwing up right next to my shopping cart. Way to go Walmart. I almost wanted to run back to my car but that would look suspicious with me running out of the store...I can't believe Tempe has come to this.

This Sephora location is my favorite. It has a convient location right next to the food court in the Scottsdale Fashion mall. Also, it has an entrance from outside so you don't have to make your way around that huge mall to find it.  The employees are extremely helpful. They also have many professional makeup artist available to help you. I use "Makeup Forever" products and I had a very nice young woman color match me with no problem. It's always good to have employees who at least appear to be happy and know what they're talking about. Anyways, love this Sephora! Will recommend this location over any one In the East valley.

Okay so I know that I probably won't find extremely fresh sushi in Arizona so maybe I shouldn't set my standards too high when I come to places like this.  RA has its ups and downs. Everytime I order from here, the food is either really good or sucks really bad. The past two times I've been here, the food has been really bad.  Idk how you can possibly mess up a California roll but mines had cream cheese in it. Imagine how pissed I was. The shrimp tempura appetizer and Calamari are decent...just don't send it out to a table when it's soggy. Eeek! The spicy tuna roll was unbelievable...and not in a good way. Idk if anybody else had Spicy Tuna that was bright orange but I never have and I was quite frankly afraid to try it.  The shrimp tempura roll fell completely apart when I picked it up. Fail. But the edamame was cool...Two stars for good service! Anywho, I will probably lay off RA for a while..

Extremely impressed with the improvement of service and quality of food with this restaurant. I literally come here especially for the Zonie and Gojira roll. Oh my gosh it's a party in your mouth!! And the hostesses and waitresses are so friendly! Will be coming here regularly :)

So disappointed. I have eaten Grimaldi's a few times and it has been amazing. I just usually avoid it because I feel it is too expensive. So today (New years) my favorite pizza place was closed so I decided to call Grimaldi's since it is only a mile away from my house. The pizza was done quite fast, however, it look completely disgusting. The cheese looked like it was like wannabe feta. Idk what was going on. The pizza literally was tasteless and I wasn't going to smother it with Parmesan cheese and crushes red peppers for taste. I most likely will not come back. Shame shame shame.

Eh, fairly small store. However, even smaller for me because I am limited to the "Ethnic hair care section" Le sigh. I needed oil sheen (which makes your hair super shiny and stuff) and the only bottle they had was one that didn't even have a top on it so the employee suggested I go elsewhere. Um...OH AND the body jewelry is very expensive. Better off at Walmart getting hair products.

Usually when I eat here, my food is good. However, today I ordered from here and the food deserved zero stars. I ordered their General Tso Chicken. I mean, I can't believe they even served me the food that they did. The rice was over cooked and extremely sticky and the chicken was so dry, almost inedible.  I would not recommend this place to anyone. If you're looking for decent Chinese in the south Scottsdale area, go to New China Gate on McDowell/Hayden.

HOLY SH*T!! I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!! I've been here quite a few times but today's visit has convinced me never to come back.  Okay so I walk in , there are about 5 women getting pedicures and NONE getting manicures. Of course, I want a full set. The employees were kind of slow on getting me a nail tech...and oh my gosh, I have the worst luck because my nail tech was a horror. So let me explain.... Okay, so first impression when he sits down in front of me: This guy looks like he has the flu. He was sweating and his eyes were drooping and he looked like he was about to vomit every other second. BUT if he wasn't sick, I have NO IDEA what the hell he was doing in the back of the shop.  As he applied the acrylics on my nails, he was shaking frantically and kept violently tapping my fingers everytime I moved them. I kept patient and calm until his palm started sweating. I wasn't okay with his body fluids all up in my fingernails so I asked "Are you okay?" And he didn't respond. Awkward....so after a while, he asked me where I lived and I said "Scottsdale" and he says "I thought you would have said south Phoenix, like with the crips and bloods", then chuckled.  LISTEN, I am not one to start confrontation by any means so I forced myself to stay calm until he was finished my nails. I paid him the $35 and left. He looked rather angry that I did not leave him a tip. I do not recommend this nail salon. I am very disappointed in the way the staff has treated me today and I think that I will travel to Tempe to have a decent nail experience.

I honestly think this place might have some of the best food in the East Valley. I always order the General Tso chicken and its always SOO good. I recently tried out the Gang Pang chicken and its really delicious. However, I'm not a fan of their lo-mein at all. Oh, and they have fast service, delivery or pickup.

Um, longest and most awkward pedicure of my life. First off, the shop is the size of a shoe box. There were only 2 employees working at the time I went in, however, they were able to get me in immediately.  An old dude did my pedicure. He nearly burned me with the hot stones and my foot massage was so weird. He was shaking my feet and his face was incredibly close to them! Made me feel a little weirded out. I got the basic pedicure ($20)....but he literally took an hour. I'm not sure if I'll be back...if so, I definitely don't want the same nail tech.

Great beer at good prices! The food is a little expensive, however, it comes with a lot. When I go in, I love betting on the horse races.. And they have a great bartender, Sam. One of my favorite sports bars.

This has to be my favorite Starbucks in Tempe. I've become a regular here every morning for their delicious drinks and yummy pastries (donuts and morning buns to be exact). A lovely barista that works there named Leah is such a sweetheart and always takes care of my order, sometimes even before I finish paying, it's awesome. I am a sucker for great customer service. This will always be my go-to 5am Starbucks stop!

Usually I don't even go to Subway but lately I've been having a weird craving so 6-inch Turkey Subs are all I've been eating. This particular Subway is great. The employees are nice and well put together (no tweakers here!)...but anywho, the Turkey is always fresh, along with the bread, Italian Herbs and Cheese ftw! And they're super fast, might give Jimmy Johns a run for their money. And last but not least, it's a clean establishment!! There's nothing than I love more than to see a clean restaurant, the customers do appreciate it...well at least I do. Anyways, if you do crave Subway occasionally, I would recommend this location.

I absolutely love this place. I wish I could give it 5 stars but I haven't tried everything on the menu. I come here every morning literally for bagels or their challah bread, so damn good! And their service is very fast and the staff is overly friendly. I love it. It's also very clean in there. However, their sandwiches (which I didn't try) were pretty expensive but I'm pretty sure it's worth it. I will def try in the near future.

I came here on Christmas night, hoping for a little appetizer to finish off the holiday right. You can't go wrong with a little sampler. Anyways, I walk in and was seated immediately. The table I was seated at had no utensils at the table. The person who took the drinks, took around 15 minutes to even get to the table. I ordered a coffee and it had to be the oldest coffee I have ever tasted so I kindly substituted it for a mere glass of coke. Like I said, I only ordered a sampler(as a half) which is mozzerella sticks, onion rings and chicken strips. Once I got my food, the mozzerella sticks were way overcooked, the onion rings were decent but the chicken strips were under cooked. Like, I'm talking still frozen in the middle. I was highly disgusted and paid the tab and left. I wouldn't recommend this particular Denny's.

I've been wanting to try these cupcakes for forever. Finally, after years living in Arizona, I tried the famous Sprinkles that everyone has been blabbing about. I must say, I am very impressed. I had the Dark Chocolate cupcake and it was delicious, however, eeek! Way too much icing. Also, this place is expensive. 23 bucks for 6 cupcakes...but despite the price, I will definitely be back to try more!

You know, I have been here before and the sushi was good. BUT EVERYTIME I ORDER TAKEOUT, MY FOOD IS RIDICULOUSLY HORRIBLE. The first time I ordered takeout, it was okay. Nothing to go nuts about. The second time, my California roll literally tasted like soap and it was warm. Yuck. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and order once more (only because Stingray sucks and RA has terrible service)...okay, my rice was soo sticky on the rolls that I choked on it...like they put superglue on my rice and it didn't finish drying... and my spicy tuna was literally dark brown. Totally unacceptable.    C'mon Pearl...I thought you were better than that.

Okay so I am a total hypocrite by giving this place one star considering the fact that I have been here more than once. Anyways, FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE....  Located next to RA, which is pretty busy like all day, surprisingly, this place is never busy(but I personally love empty hookah lounges). The lounge is very attractive. This place appears to be very upscale. There is a full bar and the menus light up which is pretty neat. There is also an upstairs and outside seating area.  The MAJOR downfalls about this place are that there is usually just one person working. It's the same guy that's been in there everytime I went. He is very inconsistent on checking on you to see if you need more coals or not. He actually isn't even in the front half of the time. Everytime I got a hookah, it has always been harsh. EVERYTIME.  Also, the prices are "go f*ck yourself" ridiculous. Extremely high for what you get. The shisha isn't a very good quality in general and to have the audacity to charge $30.00 for a single one hose, this is unacceptable under all circumstances. YA YOU'RE A NICE LOOKING LOUNGE BUT...if you give me halfass hookah, how am I supposed to enjoy myself? Why did I come here again since I had such a bad experience?...well, it's convient to me and I'm too lazy to travel.  If you are a regular hookah smoker, or just in the mood to smoke, you're better off traveling the extra 10 minutes to Tempe.

Okay, first thing is first, I love my coffee, and I love Starbucks but THIS particular location has failed to please me, twice. The first time was about 3 weeks ago, I came here on a Wednesday afternoon, wanting a vanilla chai latte. Eh, I must say, it wasn't as tasty as I expect but hey, everyone makes mistakes, no biggie. So today I decided, let me try this location put again since I'm here. I got here around 10 am. I went through the drive-thru and it was PACKED as usual. When I got to the window I specifically ordered a tall double chocolate chip frappucino. What I was handed was a Venti Carmel macchiato. Um...and when I told her what I did order, the barista caught the nastiest attitude and told me that I should have spoken louder. Exxxcusssseee me?!?! Being the nice human I am, I took my new drink she handed me and it was a java chip frappucino .....*sigh* I am so over this. I smiled and put 2 bucks in the tip jar and drove away.  Okay, LOVE LOVE Starbucks but this location, no I will hold off, thank you.

Yum yum! I created my own burrito here which consisted of chicken and every other ingredient there is possibly to add and I have to say, this place is pretty damn good. The vegetables were fresh and the chicken was nice and moist. Also when biting into my burrito, I could taste all of the ingredients together, yum! However, it is kind of expensive, I mean not more than your average Chipotle or Qdoba though... I don't like that I had to pay to get veggies in my burrito, kinda seemed odd. Other than that, this place is awesome....will be back.

Literally had me in and out. My poor car was way overdue for an oil change and a nice woman helped me out and it only took about 15 minutes and fairly cheap too. She also gave me a card that says if I get 4 oil changes, my 5th one is 2 bucks. Great deal. Will be back.

Love love the atmosphere. And I love how they have it set up so you don't have to sit in a chair the entire time. Decent hookah with very cheap prices. 10 bucks for a hookah, not bad at all. Probably my new favorite late night spot.

Best hookah products! Ever! The only place I go to for my shisha. They literally have every flavor and I cannot get over how cheap they are. Lately I've been all about these electronic hookahs (im a loser I know) but this is the only place that sells good ones. I hate the Starbuzz..I definitely recommend this smoke shop.

I really feel bad for the Yelpers who have reviewed this place with less than 5 stars. I am very sorry...for you and your bad experience.  Look, this place Sal's pizza has been around for a few years now. It was originally in Chandler (where I first discovered it) ....and me, an East coast girl who is still adapting to the West coast, I would appreciate some good pizza. Sals has the best pizza I have tasted so far in Arizona. Conveniently, Sals moved locations to Tempe so it's closer to me so I'm a happy gal all over again.

Friendly staff and great ambiance. Lots of places to sit, however, if it gets crowded, you will have to sit next to random people. The shisha is pretty good for the most part. There's free pool also if you're into that. The only buzzkill is that there are a lot of highschool kids on the weekends that seem to make it in here without ID? So it gets really annoying and loud. Other than that, I enjoy this place.

Oh my goodness, I will never return here! I am really surprised at how many awesome reviews this place has. First off, the place is on Mill Ave, pretty nice location. The inside was pretty clean but we were unable to sit in the dining room because it was closed? So we had to sit at the bar.  We ordered the cheesy bread and a small cheese pizza. I was extremely excited for this because I love cheesy bread...and it looked so good when it arrived at our table...but ugh it was so average and unappetizing. The pizza arrived fairly quickly but that didn't benefit me at all because it was not good at all. The cheese was so thick that it could choke a horse. But anyways, I give this place 1 star because we had a nice server and they had good lemonade.

Not good at all. Very soggy fries, tastes like they're straight from the freezer. And the mozzarella sticks were OKAY. Disappointed in the marinara...tastes like old tomato sauce. One star for good customer service. Won't be back though...

This place is awesome. Very beautiful interior. The menu has a huge variety of shisha flavored and a wide selection of drinks and food. They don't have a full bar so you will have to go to the restaurant next door Mijana to get drinks. And the hookah is only 12 dollars (you also don't have to buy a drink or pay cover). Definitely my favor hookah lounge in the Tempe/Scottsdale area.

Uhh this place is awesome. I feel bad for the people who have had a bad experience here. This has to be my favorite nail salon in the East Valley (so far). I've been coming here for 2 years now and I've never been disappointed. I love how amazing my full sets turn out especially French tip. The eyebrow waxes are phenomenal, I swear. My eyebrow lady is the best, except she is kind of rough sometimes, which is weird because she's so little lol. But anyways, love this place, would definitely would suggest you tell your friends.

I love love love this place! I order from here probably at least twice a week. Best pizza ive had hands down in Arizona (and AZ does not have good pizza)...they recently got garlic knots, which are delicious and cooked to perfection. I would recommend this place to anyone who doesnt wanna settle for Dominos.

Usually this pizza is really good but lately, it's kinda sucked. The pizza seems to get smaller everytime I order it. Also, they started to put rosemary on their garlic knots..ew, I mean, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe order again but if not, I will have to find a new spot pizza re..

SO LET ME TELL YOU HOW AWESOME THIS PLACE IS!!! AHHH sooo I'm super clumsy and I have an iPhone 5. If you know anything about Apple, if you don't have the "Apple Care Protection Plan" on your device, you're screwed... Soooo about a month ago, I visited this iPhone repair shop called "MacMedia" in Scottsdale, they charged me $150 to repair my iPhone screen but did warn me that some of the features may not work again properly (camera, speaker, etc...) so yup, when they were done, my front camera and speakers were non existent. Whatever, at least I have my phone right? Wrong.. About 3 weeks later, I had a traumatic experience when I dropped my poor phone again and the screen shattered...again. Sooo TODAY I called nextech and they offered to fix my screen/LCD for $99! What the eff, this is awesomeness! So I drive down there and my phone was fixed in 10 minutes. Literally. He sat there and fixed it at the front counter, right in front of me. Pretty epic. They also have LOTS of phone cases for super cheap for all of your Apple devices. I love it. Anyways, my total with screen repair and a phone case was $119.00....AND he fixed my front camera and speaker for no extra cost! I highly recommend this place for any type of device repair, they're super professional and quick and inexpensive! Hopefully I will only be back to purchase accessories and not another screen repair though..

The only reason I like this place is because the sushi plates are $2 and you can literally walk in, sit down and start eating. I had the California roll, Climax roll and shrimp tempura. The California was so so. It tasted like sushi out of the supermarket. Super crunchy vegetables were inside (which I can't stand). The climax roll ended up having cream cheese in it when it clearly says it doesn't on the description and the shrimp tempura was "okay". It was tasty, however, unacceptably cold. I was hoping to have at least a 3 star experience coming here considering the Yelp reviews say it's amazing. But I'd rather stick to Pearl and pay 7.50 for a roll, at least I know it's fresh and will be delicious.

Chris Hornak really has the most convenient VIP guest list there is in Vegas! I came to Vegas for a mini vacay with 4 girlfriends and 1 guy over Christmas weekend. If you've ever partied in Vegas, you know that it can be difficult for males to get in the club for free after certain hours. Chris Hornak was able to put all of our group of 6 on multiple guest list and we were able to get into the clubs relatively quickly. There were also free drinks everywhere we went! He's a go-to promoter.

My experience with this place has been "so-so". I want to give it 3 1/2 stars but it wouldn't let me sooo...4 stars because it was a very clean restaurant and the employees were super nice. However, the food was a solid 3 stars. I ordered the fish and chips. So basically you get a styrofoam container full of fries (which are actually really good) and about 8 small bite size pieces of a beer batter type of fish. The fish? Well..it tasted fresh but I'm sure it wasn't fried all the way through...my stomach still feels a little weird. Anyways, they have a really nice salsa bar and it's fresh ingredients too. But I don't think I will be back...

I have made my way back to this little taco joint finally and I must say, it has to be one of my favorite places for lunch now. I do appreciate how polite they are to their customers and the food is always fresh. Btw, if you ever have the taste for REALLY good French fries, this is the place!

Love love love Chop Shop protein bowls! Okay so I don't eat healthy like at all so my first initial reaction when I saw this menu was like eww but I ended up choosing the teriyaki protein bowls and let me tell ya...freakin good!! It's brown rice mixed with grilled chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and of course teriyaki sauce. It's just really good. I wish they cooked their broccoli a bit more cause I can't stand like rock hard broccoli...but anyways, the lemonade is just OK. I mean, others might like it but I feel like it needs to be sweeter..like more sugar but I get it, it's healthy blah blah. But anyways, when in doubt, the protein bowls are great for lunch or dinners!

I tried to stop myself from writing this but after a few bites, I felt like my takeout order deserved a review tonight. I guess I've learned my lesson with ordering food an hour before a restaurant closes. I thought that was ok to do but I guess not. First of all, service is good and staff is friendly but OH MAN, you know that protein bowl that I raved about in my previous review about this place? I totally changed my mind. This protein bowl they gave me tonight is inedible. Soooo...the brown rice was like a bunch of gravel. Seriously..if they told me it was chicken over rocks I would've believed them.  Second, I don't eat red meat at all, like under any circumstances. I just do not enjoy it so I always only order fish or chicken dishes at restaurants. I even emphasize the word CHICKEN when I order things..anyways...my bowl was a fairly even mix of chicken and steak. I'm glad I have hawk eyes because you could've easily mistaken it for mushrooms. The vegetables were definitely the "end of the night" batch cause they were cold and super tough.  Anyways, I thought the teriyaki sauce they provided would at least make the bowl OK if I drowned it in the rice but dude..no.  I'm praying that I chose this place on a bad night but I will have to seriously have to think about it a lot before coming back here because THAT was unforgivable.

I didn't know what to expect after reading the reviews but I have to say, I was very surprised. I went on a Saturday afternoon, around 4pm. I had a hard time actually locating the restaurant because it's not very noticeable (meaning they need a bigger sign). Anyways, you have to walk upstairs to get to the place but I didn't mind that at all. Me and my bf were greeted by two very polite men that were behind the counter and we were prompted to seat ourselves wherever we'd like. I love that :) anyways, we ordered the bruschetta and pretzel as an appetizer. The pretzel was good as well as those little cheeses and mustards that came with it. The bruschetta had a little too much tomato and Brie. The entrees we had were 'The Ivan Burger' and the Margherita pizza. Both were very delicious, the pizza was more than I expected..i definitely would come back just for it. Our waitress was very cute and nice and  knowledgable but I forgot her name. But this place is very cool and next time I come back I will try their patio. Did I mention that it has a fire place?? Yep I'll be back.

The place has excellent customer service and it's very clean, however, they severely lack on the quality of the food. I ordered two Carne Asada tacos and a vegetarian quesadilla. Bad idea! The meat was dry and tough, the tortilla wasn't heated at all when they brought it to me and on the quesadilla, there was too much cheese, ugh. Also, the guacamole has no flavor what so ever. The quesadilla was bland and I really did have to smother it in Tapatio sauce to give it any flavor. On the bright side, the chips and salsa were decent and the employees and awesome but I think I will have to pass on this place again for lunch.

THIS PLACE IS OVERRATED! Okay, I'm a simple girl. I really just love GOOD basic sushi. A good California roll here, maybe some speciality rolls, nothing too much to ask but this place has not impressed me and I feel the the reviews just led me on. First, the California rolls weren't good. I want to know how one can possibly make a bad tasting cali roll? I spit it out immediately. The rice was so sticky!! They really were shy on the imitation crab as well because it just dropped out of the roll when I picked it up. Next, the egg rolls. What If I told you that the vegetable egg rolls at Panda Express were more tasty than these? Not bashing, just saying. They weren't even full egg rolls, they were cut into little slice things. Anyways, the house salad was good, it doesn't have that thicker ginger dressing that most sushi restaurants usually have but it's cool. I don't know if I'll be back but this place seems to have plenty of fans and I hope the business continues to be successful!

Just simply delicious. I decided to try Ingo for the first time tonight after driving past it numerous times and seeing their awesome reviews. They definitely didn't let me down. I ordered in so I went through the curbside pick up. It's a small parking lot and I had to wait for others to get their food first even though they said 8-10 minutes. Anyways... I had the whitefish sandwich and the shattered potato chips. Sooooo good! The sandwich was very fresh, I just needed more sauce and I was given a generous amount of potatoes. I plan on returning and hope to become a regular.
