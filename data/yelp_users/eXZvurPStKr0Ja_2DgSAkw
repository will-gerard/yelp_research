Normally I like paradise bakery more but this location has screwed up my order more often than not

My wife is a regular.  I come once or twice a year and they remember me.  Great service, great product.  Very welcoming from the time you walk in to the time you leave.  Highly recommend.

Amazing mix of classes and the trainers do a great job motivating.  Couldn't recommend a better place to get your workout on

Amazing mix of classes and the trainers do a great job motivating.  Couldn't recommend a better place to get your workout on.  The classes never get easy and can't say enough about this place.  Make you feel like family

Went there on a Friday night and have to say top 5 meal of my life.  I got the ahi tuna tacos and Korean beef tacos and they were so amazing.  My wife got the Carne asada and said it was perfectly cooked.  It is a fun environment with great service.  I highly recommend.

Been to this a few times and never disappointed.  Brought the whole family the second time and now we are practically obsessed.  Lobster roll was amazing
