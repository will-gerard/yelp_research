To wait is one thing. To wait an hour before an appetizer even arrives at the table for two of us is crazy. The busboy came by to ask how our dinner was and our appetizer had not even come out. He said something to one of the waitresses possibly even the owner and she yelled at him. Food is good but experience was not. Will not be going back.

Always go for the tomato basil mozzarella sandwich on fresh baked bread. So glad the hours are expanded. Parking is always a bit difficult so best to go during none meal hours.   With the nicer weather it also means there is a chance to get outside tables when it is less crowded.   Family style seating inside so be prepared to share other than just a couple of small tables.

The chicken Marsala with spinach noodles is wonderful.  Always say yes when they ask if you want bread. You will want every bit of the sauce. All of the sushi is good. If anyone at the table has any dietary restrictions they will work with you. Everything is made fresh and to order.  Best to go at slower times of the day so you don't have to wait for a table.

We found everything to be wonderful!  The brie platter for the appetizer was tasty and gone in short order.  One of us ordered the fillet and the other the pork loin.  Cooked perfectly and enough that we each took half home.  The special tartes was pumpkin...there was none of that left over!  It was a great idea to use our groupon on Halloween night...only a few tables through the entire meal.  Server was attentive and chatted with us when we asked about their upcoming move in 2014.

This location can be hard to get in and out of the parking lot.  Employees are friendly and helpful.  Love it that they let me come back for a credit when I forgot my birthday coupon.

Like to go for breakfast and home cooking comfort food. The menu has been scaled back but the old stand bys are still there.  Breakfast is served all the time as it should be in a diner. Country potatoes are done crispy and just right. Omelette is a very good size and full of vegetables.  Service is generally quick and friendly.  Lots of extra charges for changes and right now for eggs because of market price.

We brought our car in for an unexpected problem which is always the worst way to try out a new auto repair place. They are in the neighborhood and we had been talking about trying them out for an oil change on one of the cars and that of course meant one of the cars broke down.  Brought it in without an appointment and Glenn worked with us to get the diagnostic report done and repairs done. The car is older and we are not sure if we are keeping it much longer so it is helpful to know some other things we might want to get done if we decide to keep it long term. There was not a high pressure sales pitch to get things done like other places. Communication with report and specifics by email was great. No surprises. Will be bringing the other car there for sure and recommending to friends!

Everyone I have encountered working here is friendly and helpful.  They were very busy this evening but made sure all registers were open and everything was well stocked.  Great soup sample, which we ended up buying.  Holiday Joe Joes have arrived!!!!

Went here for Easter brunch.  Thankfully someone knew that they do brunch for holidays since they do not show it on their website.  The brunch was spectacular!  Shrimp, crab, raw oysters, carving station with cuts of meat so tender no knife was needed.  The dessert choices kept kids and adults quite happy.  Some in our party took advantage of the personalized omlettes and loved them.  No one had room for the lobster eggs Benedict. Absolutely going back again.

Friday night all you can eat fish fry....ask for it grilled if you prefer!  Be sure to leave room for the homemade pies.  Chicken pot pie is a must try as well!

Don't be put off by the size of the place.  Why buy at the airport or other places when you can buy direct?  Best idea for gifts when traveling places that want something from Arizona!   I take family here when they visit so they get the real taste of Arizona!

Donna and Bill know how to keep us happy with the best pizza and calzones around.  You will always feel like you have stepped back east for lunch or dinner when you go there.  Casual and friendly atmosphere.

Started the weekend off right with white pizza and Caesar salad delivered from Slice of Sicily.  We love to order the biggest size because any leftovers slices can be frozen....the slices are HUGE!  Then we just reheat the frozen slices when the mood hits us! Of course it means we do not get to see Donna and Bill in person, but get to catch up and talk Cardinals by phone.

We enjoyed everything we had for dinner. Started with the Wor Won Ton soup which was full of large shrimp, chicken and vegetables as well as the won tons. Perfect for the chilly night. Then we shared beef fried rice and the honey walnut prawns. Both were delicious.  Huge prawns. The only complaint is most places serve the prawn dish with some sort of steamed vegetable; usually broccoli.  Service is friendly and portions are generous.  Parking lot can be difficult to get in and out of during rush hour.   Glad they do not cook with MSG so worth the drive.

I co-worker challenged me to a pizza taste test.  Their choice for favorite is Pino's, so we went there today.  I ordered two slices of cheese pizza, since that is the fair way to sample! The pizza is not bad, but not as good as I like.  You order at the counter, and when your number is called you go pick up your food, so there is no table service.  You lose me when you do not do free drink refills...this is AZ.  They charge .81 for a diet coke refill! The parking lot was difficult to navigate, and we almost got hit by someone when we were leaving. Several customers were coming up to the counter looking for missing food.  It looked like one table was given free cannolli when their order took especially long.  Ours came out quickly enough, and was accurate.

Always a good choice.  Best pita bread ever!  The crazy calamari lettuce free salad is my favorite.  We had some hummus to start.  It has a bit of a kick.  Casual and comfortable.   Very friendly staff.

Took a class at the Phoenix location, and also have gone there on a Friday for the ladies day specials since the range and gun fees are waived.  Good deal!  The staff are very friendly and helpful. The class is well worth taking and the instructor knew his stuff.  Good for beginners and for those who have been away from guns for a while. Safety is emphasized at all times.   Going back for more classes and practice.

What a disappointment.  Saw on facebook that their fall produce stand was now open.  Arrived to a few buckets of greens, one box of potatoes, pumpkins and jars of salsa, butters and a few other things.  No one so much as greeted us or tried to assist us.  We could not have purchased anything even if we had wanted to.

Met friends for breakfast this morning and was sadly disappointed.  I expected the 30 minute wait, but did not expect the over cooked eggs.  Now I did ask for crispy bacon and crispy hashbrowns and neither came out that way.  Maybe it was just a bad day, but I do not expect I will go back again.

Ordered take out this evening.  The delivery was quick and all the food was there...the crabpuffs were soggy and had zero crab in it.  They did not seem to be cooked to order and maybe had been sitting?  A couple of the meals were luke warm which made the coating on them taste doughy.  With the multiple meals ordered there should have been more than 3 fortune cookies.

Heard such great things so gave it a try on a Saturday late morning. Got there just in time to get a table before they started a waiting list. Got drinks right away but no one took our order for about 15 minutes. Took almost 30 minutes to get our food and then it was mediocre at best.  Skillet was very oily, although ingredients that were special ordered were accurate. Eggs on other meal were over cooked and cold, as was the rest of the food that came with it.  Seems like a lot of regulars go there so maybe this was an unusual day or they get the attention?

Being able to get fresh, seasonal and locally grown products is a big deal.  This market has grown but it has not changed the quality and neighborhood feel it has.Artists, musicians and other locals make this a fun stop on Saturday mornings and Wednesday evenings.

I love the double flyer day on Wednesdays!  The old sales and new sales are both valid.  Great gluten and dairy free options, although they stopped carrying my favorite dairy free blintzes. The employees are generally friendly and available.  Easy parking, bulk products have great sales, and they rarely run out of sale items.

This is not just cookies.  The cupcakes are award winning!  Great way to satisfy a sugar craving without spending a fortune.  Would have given them five stars but one of my visits there previous to today someone forgot to put the sugar in the frosting and each one tasted like creaked butter and light flavor instead of the usual taste.  But, it did not keep me from going back!

It is always great to support a local business. When you walk in here you feel like you have stepped back in time to something you would see in a movie!  People are talking to each other and you get a sense of the neighborhood you are in. Everyone knows Teresa.  Buy local!

We do not usually shop at this location but gave it a try this evening.  It is a clean and very friendly store.  Because we were not familiar with the layout we asked for assistance several times and received friendly responses each time.  The young man that bagged our groceries did not see our cloth bags and started to bag in plastic.  When I told him not to worry about it he insisted on re-packing them and did it with a smile. Will most certainly be back!

Free valet parking is a huge bonus.  Happy hour food deals make it a good time to sample meals at very good prices.  Outside seating available and comfortable.  Free kids meals if they are joining you, but I rarely see kids there.

The grilled eggplant sandwich is the best. Tough decision between rice pudding and baklava for dessert. Awesome lemonade.    Order at the counter, and then the service is fast and friendly.  Might have to park around the back during busier hours.

Great burgers!  Been driving by here for years and years and finally tried it last night. Only the drive thru was open; inside lights shut off as we pulled up. Burgers were as good as everyone else wrote about. Good flavor and very filling. Will be the place to go in the future.   French fries were not as crispy as either of us had hoped but it was the end of the night so we are guessing they threw a bunch in for the last few cars that pulled in at the same time. Onion rings were hot and crunchy. Want to try the zucchini next time. Plan to order extra sauce on the side for the international burger 'cause it was good and wanted more! Can see why this place has bee around so long!

I can't go 5 stars because I HATE self checkout and you have to do it there.  Other than that, the location is clean, items are fresh and in stock, and parking is easy.  When one of the employees saw us stocking up on something that did not go on sale until the 2 day sale coming up, he came and let us know we could save quite a bit by waiting for the sale.  We had misread the flyer and thought it already started.  Nice! Love the $5 off coupons!

My only complaint about this place is the noise level.  It is difficult to have a conversation.  The food is wonderful.  We said we would share a salad to start and they brought it already split, with both of us getting quite a large amount.  I ordered the bison burger with all of the fixings on the side.  It was recommended medium and it was perfectly cooked.  The sweet potato hash made it impossible to finish the whole burger. We had a 25% off coupon only good for the 4th of July.  Fox concepts sends them for most holidays when you sign up for their email...will try there new seafood Ola e on the next one!

Dr. Ruiz and all of the staff make everyone comfortable...one of my dogs is quite large, so many people are afraid of him.  He was mistreated before being adopted into our family.  He is quite timid and nervous around people because of this bad treatment.  He was afraid as soon as we walked in the door today, and everyone went out of their way to help him adjust. He has never had an accident and was so nervous that he peed all over my sneakers and the exam room.  Instead of being upset or annoyed Dr. Ruiz helped to calm him and make him relax. I was amazed that the cost was so low when we checked out.  Two prescriptions, examination and all shots for under $150.  They also helped find out who his chip was with so we could update the information on the chip. This is the place to bring furry family members in Central Phoenix.

Went for a lunch meeting this past week.  The burger was cooked perfectly and was quite moist.  The salad on the side was presented very nicely.  Our server was attentive without being pushy.  We took a bit before we actually ordered and he was very patient.

First I should say I don't like Mexican food.  I struggle to find something I can eat on the menu.   Went here tonight since someone else was craving it...I had an incredible egg, chorizo, potato, cheese breakfast burritto for dinner.  I made it clear that it had to be as spice free as possible and they did a wonderful job.  I saw the ppm taxis and bean burritto get devoured.  Guacomole had a bit too much of a kick for me bit that is how most people like it.  We took our order to go and it was all good when we got home.

Had my first appointment with Dr. Susan Sorosky this week. All of the staff is exceptionally friendly and the appointment was set up to fit my schedule.   I had the e-mail for the patient portal and all notes by the next day to myself as well as my other doctors and all imaging has already been set up.  I know what all the potential next steps are, and feel comfortable with everything.  Granted this is step one but I have no reason to believe it will change.

The employee that decided to make fun of another employee took away from what is a usually very good experience at this location.  The young man making the sandwich was being very friendly, asked all the right things to make sure everything would be made correctly and was a pleasure. Then another employee started saying and asking things that made it clear that he was making fun of him or taunting him. The first employee looked shaken up by this but continued his excellent customer service.   Other employees got quiet and busy to stay out of it.  Food is always great, but manager should be checking out this kind of treatment by one employee to another.

Just found this place two weekends ago.  Great selection of vegetable and herb plants.  They offer free classes every weekend that we hope to go to when time allows.  The people working there offer to help, but are not pushy.  So far everything that we bought for the backyard garden has been healthy.  Plan to keep going back.  So glad a friend suggested it.

I finally caught up with her at her last weekend in Phoenix about a month ago.  This is the real deal for all of us New England transplants looking for authentic seafood...lobster rolls, fried clams with bellies, chowdah, and a variety of other delicious options.  I will be following her religiously when she comes back next season.

Went to the new location. Picked up a pre- ordered mulberry and decided to get two extra avocado trees. Shamus helped us decide what to get and gave us specific advice on planting. We are still somewhere pretty close to beginners and he was very patient even though it was very busy.  Love the new place!

Stopped by after dinner last weekend at the noodle cafe next door. None of us were really sure what it was and we still weren't after we had it but ate it all.  Large servings so four of us shared two smalls. These are not your usual shaved ices since they have dairy in them. A couple of dairy free options available are made with dairy free creamer?  Lots of toppings and interesting ones to choose from.

The king crab in drawn butter in the mason jar is incredible! Great selection at the oyster bar.  Sit right up there if you can and watch the action in the kitchen. We did by accident when we went once and did not have reservations at a busier time. They will make adjustments to salads like adding shrimp instead of crab for people who need changes. Very friendly staff.  Valet parking makes what seems like a parking challenge very easy.  Be sure to enjoy the bread to get the last bit of everything!

3 of us went on Sunday.  The wait gets longer and longer on weekends.  At least be up front about how long it will really be.  Once in the server was very rushed, and the orders were a bit mixed up.  She tried to make up for it, but when items are left out from prepared food it is not quite the same when they are added on the side.  Think it is just best to go to this place during the week and avoid the crowds.

Wonderful experience.  The 3d movie at the beginning really sets the stage for going in.  Once in the variety of butterflies was amazing.  Wear bright colors if you want them to land on you.  Great photo opportunities.  There is a small cafeteria if you want to take a break and go back in.

Have been staying away from Whole Foods because we did not like that they moved in on Trader Joe's territory.  It just seemed wrong.  However, we went to get a few things that Joe's does not carry and discovered their prepared food "cafe" area.  The pizza and sushi is incredible.    The white pizza pie and salad bar was so good and inexpensive  that we went back this past weekend for our version of "pi" day on Saturday night!  Still went and did our regular shopping next door at Trader Joes.

Very disappointed that this non profit health insurance company is being targeted. My experience with my policy in 2015 was wonderful and I planned to renew as did others I know with the same plans.  It is curious that the insurance commission waited until a mere few days before open enrollment to make the announcements.  I would have preferred to have kept my coverage under speculation that there might have been financial problem mid 2016 and possibly had to change plans then, rather then be forced now into switching to companies that almost immediately do not allow continuity of care. This company went from 2000 insured in year one to almost 60,000 in year two.   Who did they scare so much in the big 3 to get so much attention to get shut down? I hope they are saved; my coverage was excellent.

The new location is wonderful!  I have been going to David and George for years.  I generally just tell David to do whatever he wants with my hair and am happy every time.   I have severe chemical sensitivities and allergies so have a difficult time in most salons.  Not here.  George and David LOVE Phoenix, and are active in the local community.  They are business owners that care not just about their personal world, but the world around them.  You will be glad that you get to know them, and found their salon.   PS...Find them on Facebook since they always send out extra special offers!
