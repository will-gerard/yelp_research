Walgreens is Walgreens:  they have stuff you need and it's convenient.   I want to write this to warn you of the growing homeless population that seems to live outside of this location.  I honestly feel bad for people that are stuck in this situation but begging just makes me feel uncomfortable.  Not a day goes by that I shop here and am pestered with requests for money.  The thing is that I don't really carry cash ever so I feel bad for not having any but also feel violated for being requested to shell out my hard earned cash to someone that is setting up camp outside a drug store and speaking low and incoherently and walking towards you and your car.  Gives me the creeps.

I guess you could say I have been here 1.5 times.  This is the closest walk in clinic to my work place so I have ventured here out of convenience.  The first time was last summer and I just felt ill all over.  After a total of 3 hours here they did not know what was wrong with me but were going to treat me like I had strep throat. Three hours is not too long to wait if the lobby had been full but there were only about 3 others waiting with me and what seemed like an army of employees.  I was in the actual exam room for what seemed like 2.5 hours.  They were "kind" enough to give me a blanket which looked like someone had vomited all over it and then it dried to a crusty finish.  The nurses kept coming in and checking on me; taking blood pressure  and temperature and demanded I take a pregnancy test.  I told them it was highly unlikely I was preggers (since I was not getting any but I felt they did not need to know all my extra cirricular activities or lack there of so I obliged them).  Finally they wrote me a prescription and I was on my way.   They never gave me the results of my pregnancy test but I was able to figure it out!   So, feeling ill and desperate I decided to give it one more chance yesterday but found myself disgusted as soon as I walked in.  There was a sign that read:  Due to technical difficulties we can not accept credit or debit cards.  Only cash or checks.  Well, I forgot my check book (since it's not 1987)  and don't carry cash so I asked the receptionist if I could put my name down and then run to the ATM about 2 blocks away.  She was at a loss for words but then basically told me no.  There were 8 people ahead of me!  I doubt they would get to the other 8 in the ten minutes it would take for me to go to the ATM.  Upset and ill I remembered another clinic that I have been told is nice and I was on my way.

I wish we could have met under better circumstances but the moment I walked into your establishment I wanted to vomit.  It reeked of sweaty gym socks and vinegar and there was no room at the bar.  Maybe I will come back with "What Odor?" in hand and we can have a fresh beginning.

The things I really like about this place are the interior and the music.  They are both hip, chic and funky.  The fact that is somewhat hidden away in the Esplanade is nice too.  It's a great after dinner spot with equally impressive people watching.  I am a fan of the Vacation Martini and the comfy couches.

What else is there to say?  This place is amazing.    Great wine.  Yummy food.  Excellent staff.  Beautiful neighborhood.  Funky/chic interior.  I love the garage door indoor/outdoor seating.   I could waste my entire paycheck here.  Better yet; I can move in and just sleep on the comfy lounge furniture.

I love breakfast here!  Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had (sorry mom).  They have all the basics plus you can build your own scrambles, omelets, etc.  I love their vegetarian style scrambles.  The portions are so large that you can easily share with another person.  You have to try the warm cinnamon rolls for dessert (or take one home with  you).  Again, it is quite large and you will need help finishing it off.  The interior is very clean and simple with a monochromatic color scheme (much like what you expect from an actual farmhouse).  The staff is always very friendly and warm.  I guarantee there will be a wait on the weekends so get there early and put your name on the list.    I did try this place for lunch and I feel the breakfast is far superior.

It's a shame I haven't eaten here in a while because the food is great!  It's a quaint cafe with excellent pizza and sandwiches. The interior is cozy with old album covers on the walls and the servers are super friendly.  They also have outdoor seating available.  It  can get crowded at lunch time so plan ahead.  If you are in the area I highly recommend you trying it.

What's girl to do when she turns 30?  Have a spa day and live it up!   I decided to start my third decade off in style with my favorite things; wine chocolate and the spa.    I called a few days ahead and booked the relaxation massage along with the spa pedicure.  I also convinced a girlfriend to take the day off with me to relax and unwind.  We arrived and were greeted by smiling faces with menus for us to choose our spa lunch.  We were then given the tour of the large facilities and were on our way to being pampered.  I kept thinking why I had not taken advantage of this place sooner.  I do live in the area and it seems a shame to not frequent this spa.    The relaxation massage was just what I needed to loosen up after a busy work week.  As soon as I was able to get replenished my lunch arrived; salad, bread, fruit and cookie.  The portion was so surprisingly large that I could not finish it!  Up next; we decided to experience the steam room.  My skin felt about 10 years younger!  I am convinced I need a steam shower in my bathroom.  After lounging around for a few hours we ended the day with pedicures.  The staff is so professional and they use great products.  I can't go to cheap $20 nail salons b/c their crappy lotions give me a rash so it's nice when you can have the entire experience; ambiance, nice products and great price.  I will sure check out the first Wed of the month special!

I received a gift certificate here and decided to use it on the microdermabrasion/facials.  I was a virgin to the whole facial world but now I'm addicted.   I wasn't sure what all "microdermabrasion" consisted of.  It sounds rather harsh and scary (esp since I saw that episode of Sex and the City when Samantha stopped in for a quick mircodermabrasion session and she was the color of a lobster).  I was proven wrong.  It's basically a deep facial.  There is no downtime and no harsh redness; instead you get to enjoy a series of relaxing deep cleaning facials that come complete with a neck and shoulder massage!   They import this awesome cream from Italy that makes your skin look amazing (unfortunately we cannot buy it retail in the US)!     Priscilla knows skin care and I will certainly be back for more sessions soon.

You had me at half price bottles of wine..... As if it couldn't get any better you gave me the mushroom and brie soup.  I think I was in heaven.  So yummy.  I will make the trek from Scottsdale for this creation.   The staff was very friendly and the interior is very neat and clean.  The prices are fair and portions are quite large.  Icing on the cake:  no fake boobs or bleach bond hair to be seen!  Am I in AZ?  Such a breath of fresh air.

I found this day spa when I was living in the Gilbert area.  I decided to check it out since it was literally half a block from my apartment and seemed decent when I was peeking in through the window.  When I arrived for my appt I found the interior to be bright and whimsical.  The staff is very professional and I could always occupy myself with the great magazine selection they have in the waiting area (not to mention the coffee and water service).  The services I had were the brow/lip waxing and sugaring, pedicure, and mini Swedish massage.  I have to say that the sugaring was preferred over the waxing since I have sensitive skin.  I'm not sure how many places in the valley offer it but you should try it (or maybe just get laser hair removal?)   I have only received a few professional pedicures (mainly due to the fact that it's not always in the budget) but I would rather get a pedi from a professional spa than one of those $20 nail salons.  Yes, you pay a little more but you also don't have a reaction to the cheap ass lotion they use in those places!  yuck!  The mini Swedish left me rejuvenated but not drained as some longer massages can leave you feeling.    I have yet to receive any treatments in the salon but had a friend that had several hair cuts and recommended the stylists highly.   The prices are fair and the menu is quite extensive so if you are in the area check it out.

This place is very cool and laid back.  Apparently Unlce Bear was someone's dog b/c there are dog pics plastered all over this place.  If you are a dog or even a pet lover in general you would appreciate the decor/vibe of this grill/bar.  It is literally a "throw your peanut shells on the floor" joint (they come served in a dog dish) with very cold beer on tap and an eclectic mix of people that dine here.  The Gilbert location is a bit more conservative versus the East Mesa spot.  People in Gilbert seem to think it's ok to bring their small children to bars!   I am a huge fan of the BBQ chicken quesadilla (or you can get it served as a pizza).  I really haven't tried much else on the menu b/c I can't seem to stray from my BBQ chicken; It is yummy and when I lived in the east Valley I would dine there about once a week.

I've lived in Phoenix for about three years now and I finally made it out to my first spring training game.  Now I have to preface this with the fact that the entire outing was free (in the VIP area)!  My employer decided to have our delayed holiday party at the ballpark and the weather was cooperating.  There's nothing better than sipping cold beer under an umbrella while taking in the sights.  I'm not much of a baseball fan but the people watching and the amazing weather and decent snacks were enjoyable.  It's the end of Feb and almost too warm to be in the full sun.  I can't imagine sitting in the  sun once spring is in full bloom but I will more than likely attend again.  Next time I will bring a blanket and my own umbrella so I can take a nap on the lawn in between drinking several much needed beers.    Side note:   they now serve Widmer Hefeweizen on tap!  Yay!

This is where the beautiful people converge on a Friday night to eat some amazing food and drink wine.  I am continually entertained by the people that frequent this establishment.   I have sampled salad and pizza and have yet to be disappointed!  The service is friendly and attentive.  I prefer the outdoor seating so you can have a better vantage point while people watching.  You do have to get the dolce for dessert but split it with someone!  It's huge and you might be intimidated.  Either way you won't be disappointed.

Thank you for ruining my Saturday afternoon.  It's been 15 hours since I ate here and I am just now starting to feel normal again.  I've been eating tums and chasing them with soda (to settle my stomach) as well as making several bathroom trips.  I have never been this sick from eating anywhere.  I think Taco Bell would have been far superior and they don't even serve real meat!      The chips and salsa were okay.  My bf and I split the cheese crisp with beef (first mistake).  The beef looked grey  and the cheese looked old and overcooked. My entree was the chicken burrito,  I think they use chicken in a can b/c the meat was so dry and shredded.  The waitress offered a sauce on top and good thing I accepted b/c otherwise I would have had to choke down the dry burro.    Gordon Ramsey needs to take over and revamp this place.  The location is prime but it seems like they were just being lazy all around.  I think they need to pare down the menu because there are too many choices and most of it is the same crap just re-worded.  Also, I kept seeing so many servers standing around shooting the shit.  If you don't have any tables you could be helping out in other ways.     This place really lacked warmth from the staff and I think it's important to make your customers feel welcome.   I really don't see myself coming here ever again unless they make huge changes.

My friend refers to this place as "Hitler's Bunker" but I choose to see the romantic side of Kazimierz.  I love the dark, cool interior with the large comfy sofas and chairs.    It can be daunting to find a bottle of wine since the list is incredibly vast.  I usually settle for a wine flight like the French Kiss or I open up the book to a random page and swirl my finger around until I land on a bottle in my price range.  The flat bread pizzas and fruit and cheese trays have been nothing but impressive.  Some of the waitstaff can be a bit surly but most of the interactions have been quite positive.  All in all I think this is a superb place to take a date after a nice dinner so you can unwind.

I would like to have eaten here but they didn't seem to want to serve us.  It was a Monday evening and the restaurant was only 1/3 full.  We were seated for 15+ minutes without anyone acknowledging us.  We even tried to flag down the hostess to find out where our waiter was and she kept walking by.   The music was a little too loud  and the interior was predictable.  I am giving 2 stars b/c I have been to another Ra location and liked their sushi.

I can't wait to come back and actually eat dinner.    We basically crashed a birthday dinner and nibbled on appetizers and dessert.  The Ravioli appetizers were yummy.  Little cheese and meat filled pasta baked to perfection with a marina dipping sauce went well with our wine.  When the birthday dessert was passed around the ooey gooey butter cake was to die for!  I  might be having dreams about it soon.  I wanted to devour the whole plate but that is very un-lady-like and I was already a little uncomfortable not actually being invited for the festivities!     The interior was very romantic.  Dim lighting with candle light.  They even have outdoor seating but you are facing Scottsdale Rd so that might not be the best spot for a quiet intimate night.    The prices were very reasonable and the service was amazing!

I finally ate dinner here and it's official:  I am a fan!  I decided to go with the salmon.  Yeah, I know we are in the desert and yes it's a steak house but I was not in the mood for beef that night.   The salmon was excellent as were the steamed veggies and of course we ordered the ooey gooey cake.

Fuck this place!!!!!!    I decided to sign up for a 3 day pass online because I recently moved to south Scottsdale and it's the closest gym to my place.  I know many people that are members and all seem to be pleased with the services/size/convenience etc...    I print out my pass, get ready for the gym and drive the few blocks.  When I arrive I am greeted by the receptionist and I let her know that I signed up for a 3 day pass online.  She immediately calls up one of the sales people to enter me into the system.  I'm not crazy about the whole "entering me into the system" thing because it's just a 3 day guest pass but whatever.  I just want to workout  and get on with my day so I comply.  He asks for my driver's license and types in my number.  He asks if I have been here in the past six months and I say no.  Then he says to me that he cannot give me a 3 day pass b/c the system says that I have been here in the past 6 months.  I am completely confused because I have never been to any LA Fitness or even given my drivers license to this place to swipe.  Not even in another state.  He listens to me but looks at me like I am lying.  He then proceeds to try and sell me a membership and not only that he wants to up-sell me shit I don't even need.  I already told him I have no family and he keeps bringing up the family benefits!  What an ass!  I said I don't have kids you jerk off!  Anyway, he keeps trying to show me all the different types of membership levels and I interrupt and say "so I can't workout today without  signing up"?  and he says "no".  What a load of shit.  I have not even seen the facilities!  What has happened to customer service?    What is so wrong with me getting a 3 day pass?    No thanks LA Fitness!  You suck!

Every time I go in here I can't help but get the giggles due to the drug theme.  It's cute and I just can't help but envy the employees just a bit for having a laid back work environment.      The sandwiches are great and I love that you get to customize them right before your glazed eyes.    The only negative is that the dining area is so small.  You have to basically stalk tables at certain points in the day.

I go to GB for the balcony and the hefeweisen.  One a warm sunny day there aren't many places I would rather relax.  Watching the people on Mill Ave as well as the planes flying into Phx can kill a few hours if you are bored.  The food is ok.  The hummus appetizer is usually a safe choice as is the pizza.

I have no idea who Dilly is but they sure know how to make sandwiches!!!  I have devoured many a delicious meal from this joint and they have never disappointed me.  The interior lacks much creativity but who really cares when you are scarfing down some of the best sandwiches in the valley? The vibe is very college and laid back.  It can get hectic around lunch so if you go keep in mind that it might  take a while.

If only it were closer but it's well worth the drive.  It's tucked away in a plaza in Cave Creek.  The interior is very geriatric but the food is amazing!    We split a sausage pizza and I can't remember the last time I had sausage that fresh!  Yummy!  Everything is made from scratch so you don't have that bloated feeling after you devour half a pizza packed with preservatives.  Next time I will try the tasty desserts that were staring me down as I left.

I met a friend for lunch here before a design show.  It was the perfect prelude!  It was a warm sunny winter day in AZ and dining alfresco was in order.  We both ordered drinks; I had the Black & Blue Mojito and she had the Fesca.  We shared the White Truffle Paremsan and Chive Fries!  Yummy!   I was warned that my drink was sweet but honestly it paired well with the Turkey on Grilled Flatbread with a side of mixed green salad.  The Turkey sandwich was made with a tasty hummus, avacado and fresh tomatoes.  I like simple, uncomplicated taste - maybe that's why I like the Fox Concept Restaurants so much.  The outdoor patio is great for people watching as well as soaking up the great AZ weather.     I hope to eat here again soon.

ok.....This is my new reason to venture to downtown Phoenix.   A friend tried Fez recently and has been talking about it non stop so we decided to "eat our way across downtown Phx" yesterday.  This was by far our favorite spot!   How can you not have a good time in such an uplifting interior paired with delectable food, friendly staff and tasty beverages?  The chicken phyllo packets were too good!  The only disappointing aspect was that Thomas was not working.  *** I only had a bottled beer but I will return for an actual specialty drink as I hear they are amazing.

I love Mamma Mia's!  The pizza never disappoints and the salads are always fresh.  I had the chicken fettucinne once and it practically  melted in my mouth.  They have an extensive menu to include antipasta and authentic desserts.     I always get delivery but recently I decided to check out the actual  interior.  The "dining area" consists of one small table and then an L shape bar that faces the store front and a wall so you will want to either carry out or deliver.

Hidden away it is!  I forgot where it was located (some friends drove me here and I was not paying attention as to how we arrived).  The interior is funky, dark, and small (cool copper counter tops) but that just adds to the character.  I ordered pork enchiladas(?) and shared the sauteed garlic dish (i think that's what it was)?  It was very yummy and left me wanting more.  The only downfall was that the garlic must have gotten into my pores b/c I felt like I smelled of garlic for days!  It was well worth it though and a spot you should certainly check out.

I popped into this spot with a small group of people for their "after dinner hours" bar set-up.  The interior is very chic and they open up the side doors so that you can enjoy the amazing weather both from the inside or the outdoor patio.  I can imagine the dining experience is wonderful but I have yet to return because the chaos surrounding the bar did turn me off.  It took us about 30 minutes to even got close enough to the bar to start a drink order.  Granted, it was a weekend but with an establishment this large they need more servers (maybe some called in sick that night).   The next thing that turned me off was the overabundance of the pretentious patrons.  I am told that  Britney Spears has dined here in the past.  I guess I was supposed to be impressed by that but all it did was make me wanna throw up a little in my mouth.    I should actually come here for a meal once and see how I like it .  Maybe the bar thing just isn't my scene.  However, I do give them kudos for the outdoor seating area.

I hope more people are frequenting this place since I was last there.  It's tucked away in a strip plaza (shockingly)!  The interior is cutesy and bright while upbeat music is playing.  They have a small outdoor seating area and some booths and tables inside.  The food is cooked fresh for you (so there will be a short wait).  It is set up like Sauce where you order at the cashier area and they bring the food to you.  I simply love their gyros!  It's relatively quick but always fresh and inexpensive!

It wasn't until my second visit here that I realized this place is not The Good Egg, hahahaaa  Ok...so I may have called in sick one day from work because I needed a "me" day and started it off with U.S. Egg.  What a brilliant idea suggested by my gentleman caller.    I ordered the Horn of Plenty Omelet and yes it was!  I just can't seem to order anything but omelets.  I love all the diced veggies, cheese and yummy egg.  I sampled some of his blueberry pancakes and washed it down with coffee and OJ.  It just doesn't get any better than that!    The service was great and the wait was short (but it was a work day).    *I did go back on a weekend and the wait was not bad.  Side note:  I still have not tried the Good Egg but it's on the list.

The first thing that sticks out in my mind was the service.  Our waitress was all smiles and incredibly adorable!   Edamame was perfectly steamed  Sushi was tasty  Salmon Teriyaki was delicious  sake and kirin washed it all down  prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is calming.

This is the first restaurant I tried once I arrived to the Phoenix area.  I had just spent 2 days crossing Texas, New Mexico and finally arriving into sunny AZ.   There was a short wait but nothing unusual for a weekend.  The chips and salsas were very addictive.  I have tried the chicken burro and the shrimp quesadilla.  I can't seem to get away from the shrimp quesadilla. The mango sauce is amazing; not too heavy yet not too light.  The only draw back to the menu was that they did not serve alcohol (at least when I was frequenting this place).    The staff is always very friendly and prompt but I can't say that for the customers.  Like most places in Gilbert there are children running around like wild monkeys.  One time I was eating dinner with my date and a small child ran up to our table and proceeded to fondle our tortilla chips.  We looked around but found no parent in sight.   To me it's a little too relaxed with the "family friendly" atmosphere and that has kept me from returning but if you are in the area do stop by and check it out for yourself.  I'm sure the meal will please you.

I've eaten here twice and each time I haven't been all that impressed.  The food isn't terrible but it's not that great either.    My first experience was about 2 months ago and I was incredibly hungry for lunch.  My coworker mentioned this place and I was excited to try something new.  The chips and salsa are pretty good.  There were three of us in the party and we all ordered different dishes but they seemed to only screw up mine.  I ordered the pork tacos and I got steak instead.  I'm not a huge beef eater.  I never order steak when I eat Mexican.  I reserve my steak cravings for a simpler meal.  Anyway, when the dish was presented to me I looked confused and said "this is steak and I ordered the pork" .  the server looked at me like I was lying and I just had this bummed expression on my face.  She offered to re-make it but we were short on time and I said "Don't worry about it.  I'll eat this".  You would think she would have discounted it or something but no.  Maybe most people would have been thrilled but I was craving pork.  I probably should have argued the bill but honestly I didn't have the energy.    The second time I stopped in (with my coworker in order to give it one more chance) I ordered the pork enchiladas and the pork was quite pink!  I didn't get sick but I was a little nervous to eat such pink pork.   All in all that meal was better but I quickly became upset when I was paying the bill and got pinned in between the cashier stand and the front door when someone decided to enter the restaurant!  Yes, the front door opens inward (this is against fire code if the occupancy is 50 or more).  so, there won't be a third time.....this place just rubbed me the wrong way both visits.  The food isn't bad but the environment and the servers didn't do it for me.

What I love about this place:  You can submit an order online and go pick it up without having to wait in the long lunch line!  Thank god for the internet.  The staff is efficient for the most part.  The sandwiches are made to order and they have outdoor seating.  It's close to where I work so I come here often.

Now I'm not an expert on Vietnamese cuisine but I do consider myself a fan (frequented several Vietnamese restaruants across the US) and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Noodles Ranch.  Maybe it's because the location is not prime (strip mall with a Taco Del Mar next door) but for some reason I didn't have high hopes.  The wait staff is a bit quiet/reserved but I prefer to not be bothered by a waiter asking me 50 times if things are ok.  I have ordered the Mango Chicken and the Curry chicken as well as the sampler appetizer.  I'm not proud to admit this but each time I go I practically inhale the entire meal before I realize it.  I also tried their Fusion Ginger Limeade which was very refreshing.

What's the deal with the pies at this place?  They peddle them like they are filled with liquid percocet.   I have never seen such a scurry of senior citizens to "reserve" pies.  I've been here a few times and I can say that the Veggie Omelet never does me wrong.  I usually try to add a cup of fruit or snack on my dining partners pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc...  Th wait staff is decent but seems a little pissed at the customers.  I can't blame them as this place is always packed and that means refilling grandma's coffee constantly.    One day I will try a pie - it just may be the best pie ever.

This is by far my favorite spot for a massage.  This spa is located in a strip mall (very common in AZ) with an unassuming store front.  The reception/check -in  area is quite small but don't let that discourage you.  I feel that the owners realized that they needed to utilize all the square footage as possible b/c once you enter the "spa area" it is quite large.  I was given a gift certificate and made an appt for the "Take me to heaven" massage.   Now, I have received massages all over the USA and several spots in Europe and this particular blend of swedish, aromatherapy and hot stone massage was most definitely the best I have ever received.  It relaxed and rejuvenated me and by the end of the massage I did not want to leave the establishment!    The prices were not outrageous either.  I think the 90 minute massage was about $90.

Two words:  Sweet Pork!  Yummy!  I was addicted to this stuff when I worked nearby.  You can build your own burritos, tacos, quesadillas etc. with sweet pork, beef, steak and Mango chicken (which is also a good runner up to the pork).  The atmosphere is very casual with surfing videos playing constantly and tons of small children running around.  It's a great spot for a quick lunch or soaking up the sun in the outdoor seating area while people watching.

WOW!  A gym that I love at first sight.   Let's start off with the receptionist; friendly, not pushy and laid back.  I needed to get in a workout ASAP and she did not make me go on the obligatory tour/sales pitch walk.  I was told that this platinum location has free bottled water and towel service, yay!  Also, the locker rooms have digital locks so no need to bring your own pad lock, another plus!  Once I entered the womens locker room I felt like I was at a spa; great lighting, well equiped "dressing" area to include hair dryers and tioletries needed for getting ready at the gym as well as TV's.   The members seemed very friendly and I was told that they have a cap on memebership to keep the club from being crowded.  What a novel idea. They have a great collection of cardio machines that have a flat screen TV attached to each one.  The assortment of weight machines as well as free weights is plentiful as well.  They offer classes that are part of your membership rather than paying out for them individually.   The average member ship is around $35/month; not a bad deal at all for what you get.  Other notable items:   1)  the gym is attached to the ice den so you can watch ice skating while you workout. 2)  great music.  they were playing Mazzy Star while I was there. 3)  it seemed to be douche free, a rarity in Scottsdale 4)  they offer a clothing store if you need or want anything 5)  free WIFI 6)  massage services available 7)  personal training  I was told that not all the locations have the same ammenities so check your local Mountainside Fitness for their offerings.  This location is smaler than most so I was told.

What is it about Mimi's that makes me instantly feel 10 lbs heavier as soon as I walk through the door?  Maybe they import humid air in here?  or maybe it's the soul food being whipped up in the kitchen?    I've eaten here on a few occasions (not my choice) and both times the food was ok (I opted for salad).  The bread is quite good and so are the desserts.  I am just not a huge fan of the menu and style of cooking.  If you do like calorie packed comfort food then please do stop in for a bite.

I love my career!    I was invited to join a few local designers for an afternoon at the Biltmore Spa (sponsored by one of our vendors).  Who doesn't want to ditch work early and go pamper themselves?  We all arrived in the parking lot and tried to find the entrance.  It's quite hidden but just look for the pool area and it's two buildings east.  After checking in we all settled into our robes and decided to glance around since we had a little time to kill.  I will be honest that the interior really needs to be updated.  One of the ladies in our group said that it's in the works.   I sure hope so because the decor is a major part of the spa experience.   It is all about the senses.  The actual skill of the massage therapist was amazing.  I had the Hands of Healing massage and I have to say that it's one of the best I have ever received!  She had such strong hands and the technique combined deep tissue and relaxation with heat.   I was in heaven!  My only suggestion is a little aromatherapy to complete the experience.  If you get a treatment you do have access to the whirlpools, sauna and  steam room so you can make a day of it!  I will certainly be back once the remodel is complete.

Incredibly swanky.  This secluded bar is the ultimate spot to take in the beauty of Paradise Valley.  You can grab a seat at the bar or wander outside to the patio area.  You must try the cantaloupe martini.  It's incredibly refreshing and would be best enjoyed on a warm summer night.

This place has a cool, retro chic thing going for it as far the interior is concerned but all the loveliness ends there.   First off, the entrance is kind of awkward.  As soon as you walk into the "bistro" you are in the middle of the restaurant traffic pathway.  It is a small place and you feel somewhat cramped and there was no host/hostess in sight.  One of the bartenders greeted us and let us pick our spot (there weren't too many options) so we sat by the door.  The bartender took our drink order (which by the way they only serve half bottles of wine but still charge full bottle prices) and then said the waitress would be right over to get our food order.  We perused the menu several times and were still waiting on the waitress to come our way.  She passed by us many times but seemed too concerned with the other tables.  Finally we palce our order after the bartender had to tell her many times that we were ready.  We split a salad and then placed an order of the Buffalo stax and the "build your own" beef stax.  They never asked how we wanted them cooked and to be quite honest it did not dawn on us until we were eating them but mine arrived "very well done" and my boyfriend's arrived raw in the middle and burned on the outside.  Needless to say we were upset but very hungry and ate what we could.    I think the staff is too preoccupied with keeping a trendy Scottsdale image that they lack quality on the food and service level.  It's quite a shame b/c the location is great and they would have no problem keeping regulars coming to an overpriced burger joint.  I would never go back here again.  The meal made both me and my boyfriend ill before we made it home (only 10 minutes away).  If you want an overpriced but yummy burger then go to Deluxe Burger!

If I had read the reviews on here before I decided to meet a friend for happy hour I might not have gone.  I'm glad I went into it blind.      The first thing I noticed was the modern/industrial store front and then walked in to find a cool/dim interior.  We decided to sit on the covered patio since we had both been cooped up in the office all day.  It was a little too warm to be outside but that just prompted me to order a light white wine.  The prices are steep but I assume that going into a trendy wine bar in Old Town Scottsdale.  You are paying for the total experience.  We decided to split the sweet potato fries and they were HEAVENLY!  Our server was incredibly attentive and even the hostess stopped by to chit chat.  Apparently a bus boy ditched his shift so they were short staffed but I honestly didn't notice.  The entire staff seemed to be calm and working in a good flow.    Maybe Fine's heard about all the bad reviews and have made a positive change?  It was early in the evening and they weren't super busy and I did not order dinner.  Maybe that was the difference?  All I know is that I will go back.  The sweet potato fries will be calling my name again!

I had the pleasure of relaxing at this spa on a lazy Sunday afternoon in the middle of the Phoenix summer.  I can't think of a better way to spend my free time and I just wish I had the funds to do it more often.  This spa is tucked away on the south end of the JW Marriott Resort at Desert Ridge.  The entire spa changing area was very clean and organized and there was always a friendly staff member close by to assist you with anything.   I had the couples massage (gift from the guy I was dating).  It was my first couples massage and probably my last.  I enjoyed the actual treatment but the idea of two other people in the room made me feel a little on edge.  I'm not quite sure what the deal is with the couples massage anyway.  It's not like you are looking at them (the room is dark).  After the massage we changed into our swimsuits and went down to the pool to relax and get a bite to eat from the spa bistro.  I had a veggie burger and "spa chips".  The spa chips were basically veggie chips but they were yummy as was the burger and much needed after the treatment.  The pool area was very relaxing (no children) and you can even reserve the cabanas if you would like to have more room to lounge.    I think more locals don't frequent this spa b/c it's quite a drive (unless you live in No. Scottsdale/No. Phoenix) but it's well worth the drive.

I was shopping one day at Aveda in Chandler Mall and was discussing hair products, etc.. with the staff when they informed me of this place.  I had no idea that a gym would also offer a full service salon and day spa.  Much to my surprise LifeSpa is an Aveda concept salon/spa meaning that they solely use Aveda products in all of their beauty treatments.  If  you are familiar with Aveda then you know they are a company based on using pure flower and plant essences.    I booked my hair appointment with hesitation since I had a bad hair experience in the past that always makes me gun shy to try something new.  When I arrived I was greeted with a hot cup of the Aveda tea!   I love their tea and look forward to it every time I come here or visit the store in the mall.  I found the interior to be more organic and natural feeling than I expected (since it's located inside the Lifetime Fitness Gym).  I was introduced to Monique (my stylist) and she actually took the time to do a true consultation about my hair: what I wanted, what I had in the past, short term goals, long term goals, color, texture and on and on.  I wanted to put color in my hair and she and I discussed lowlights and highlights.  I was very impressed by the amount of time she put into figuring out my hair and what would look best.    When I started going here in winter of 2005 my hair could barely tuck behind my ears and now I have hair that is a few inches below my shoulders!  Monique made the hair growing experience less painful than it had to be.  She always trimmed and styled my hair according to the stage of growth!  Since 2005 I have moved to the central Phx area but still make the drive out to Gilbert to see her because she is amazing and I have complete trust in her abilities.  If you are in the area please check them out.  I have not tried any spa treatments there (mainly due to the amount of money I spend on the hair)!  I do get low and high lights so the bill usually comes in around $120ish but I feel it's worth it since I only get my hair treated once every 3 months.  FYI:  You don't have to be a member of the gym to use the salon/day spa.

I have yet to actually dine in but I can say the take out is amazing!  The manager is always friendly.    I love the Pasta Martini with the bread and dipping oil...simply yummy.    The interior is quaint and there seems to be great business each time I stop by.  I like that they have a small bar area if you just want to have a glass of wine and nibble on appetizers or wait for your food to go.

This might be the best spot in Tempe to watch the sunset.  The view from the outdoor patio is amazing.  I wish I could say that the outdoor patio was smoke free though.  I actually had to walk inside to get a breath of fresh air!  That aside, the interior is spacious and they have a chic black and white theme with the decor.  The couches in the private lounge areas aren't all that comfy but then again you don't want people to fall asleep on the furniture either.      The mix drinks seemed strong and the servers were good about coming around and checking on you.  It's always nice when you don't have to stand in line at the bar to get a drink.  The crowd is a bit younger since you are in Tempe but if you don't mind rubbing elbows with some undergrads then you might want to check this place out. If for nothing else you need to at least see the view of downtown Tempe.

It's Saturday night and the bf's 30th birthday.  A group of us decided to head to The Shout House since it was fun the last time we went (Nov 2008).  This time, however, was not enjoyable.  We got there around 9pm and paid our cover.  We were lucky enough to find a table that was a good distance from the stage.   After about 20 minutes a waitress finally came over for our order.  We got a round of beer and water - the water never came and it took another 20 minutes to get the beer.  The place was not crowded so I'm not sure what the hold up was.    As we were drinking our beer we could not help but notice the table next to us: about half a dozen middle aged single women that were incredibly drunk and overweight that were grinding on each other.  Then the painist introduced an engaged couple - yet again a middle aged, overweight couple dry humping and grabbing each other on stage.  We all became disgusted and hurried to finish our drinks.  We all agreed to leave.   On our way out the birthday boy asked to speak to the manager - he complained about the waitress and then asked about a free birthday cover.  The manager said that if you let them know when you are in line then yes you can get in for free.  They do not advertise this so the birthday boy asked for a refund for his cover.  The manager would not comp him.  He stated that they do not give refunds.  This manager needs to work on his customer service skills.  It was his birthday afterall - why be a dick and lose business?    I can't see myself coming back here ever.

I have been here twice while working in Vistancia.  It's a typical "order at the counter and then they bring out the food too you" AZ eatery.    On the first visit we ordered the Grande pizza (their supreme) and it was quite tasty.  The service was mediocre but my company was quite entertaining.  The second time I opted to eat here I decided on the sausage sub and my coworker had the roast beef sub.  I was less impressed the second time around as they skimped on the meat.  My sub was mainly bread; soggy bread from all the sauce and my co workers sub only had 1 thin layer of roast beef but was loaded down with lettuce and cheese.  Now I know we are in a depression but please don't get so cheap with your portions.  We spent $5.50/person for this "lunch special".  My advice:  If you come here don't get a sub.  Just go for the pizza.

I work in the area and just discovered Sami's as the newest occupant of the plaza on the northeast corner of Priest and Washington.  It's about time we get more dining options in that area and I just so happen to be a fan of gyros.  The set up is much like the other places in the plaza where you order at the counter and then they call your number.  Basically fast food style but for a quick bite for lunch what else do you need?    The daily lunch special is a gyro with fries and a soda for only $5.95.  The only complaint I have is that they need to add more tsatzki sauce because it was a little too dry for my liking.  You will just need to add a side to your order.   The bazmati rice and greek salad are quite tasty and can be ordered as sides too.    It can get crowded at lunch so get here before noon and you can actually grab a table inside.  If you throw in your business card at the counter bowl you can win a free lunch like I did!

I have to admit that I find myself thinking that I like mine tall dark and Russian.    It's nice to have a coffee shop near by that's not Starbucks, has good coffee and reasonable prices.  So far I just stick with the house brew (which is smooth and not too bitter yet not too sweet) since the fancy coffee drinks usually have many calories that I do not need!  I have tried the blueberry muffin-quite yummy as well as the chocolate chip cookies- delicious.  The cafe is attached to The Great Indoors so you can people watch, browse thru design books or take a leisurely stroll through the design center.  It's a great way to unwind or perk up on your choice of caffeinated beverage.

I don't think I will ever go to another bagel shop again.  This place is awesome.  The atmosphere is relaxing.  The staff (which includes the owners) are incredibly friendly and most importantly the bagels are great!  They have a huge menu to choose from for breakfast and lunch and they seem to have sepcials daily for various items.

I was introduced to this hidden spot by my new co-workers.  We decided to have a lunch meeting here.  It's located in the Scottsdale Design Center so you have to look for that huge grey building and then you will come upon this quaint spot.  We were greeted by the kind hostess that just so happend to be french.  I love it when places have a touch of authenticity when possible.  The interior is simple yet it has the proper touches of a French style cafe.  One side of the cafe opens into the main hall of the design center so you can people watch as you are waiting for your meal.     I decided to order the Parisian Panini with a side of fruit salad and both of my lunch guests ordered the Turkey Panini with fries for the side.  The wait was fine and once the food came out I basically devoured my panini.  I would say that this is hands down the best panini I have ever had.  My co-workers agreed as they cleaned their plates too!  I will certainly be back for another panini....especially since it's convenient.  Next time I will try one of their mouth-watering desserts.

My friend suggested we meet here for lunch - so glad she did - it was great!  I arrived a few minutes early and was pleasantly surprised to see the design & decor.  It felt like I was in California with the modern chic theme.  I was delighted that they spared no expense in the restrooms!  They might have one of the nicest restroom facilities around.  Once my friend arrived we decided to sit out on the patio area.  It's so nice being able to sit outdoors in the winter when most of the country is experiencing record cold temps.  We both decided on salads - she had the Chopped salad and I chose the Arugula & Sour Apple (with Balsamic Onions).  We also shared a side of brussels sprouts - delicious!  Both salads were very fresh and tasty - there's nothing better than uncomplicated flavor.  The service was excellent!  The waitstaff was attentive and always ready to refill those beverage glasses.    I can't wait to come back at night and try the dinner menu while sipping a cocktail.

I met you in Wuerzberg in 2001 and then revisited you again in Zurich in 2002.  Now I hear you are in my city!  Dreams do come true!  It's been a long time coming but I think the opening could not have been planned better since we are now amidst "tough economic times".  I love your low prices, great style and good quality.  For being bargain wear you sure do hold up after many years of use.   I can now stop shopping at other "bargain" clothing stores since you moved into town.    Thank you!

You would think after you spend over $80.00 for an oil change, tire rotation and upgraded car wash they would actually wash the car and clean the interior (since that's what you paid for) but apparently I was a victim of wishful thinking.  I just don't know how people can not have pride in their job...no matter what the pay.  I guess I have always taken my jobs seriously and gone above and beyond most of the time.  I would rather clean it myself but I don't have the supplies.    Just skip the car wash if you want to come here.  It's a huge let down.
