Pizza was good but took 20 minutes then told me they would call me.40 minutes later I returned and my pizza was under two others, they never bothered calling my number and not even an acknowledgment or apology.When I finally got home someone else said they had a similar experience at the food court.as a side note the Valentines Day bouquets (it's now three days after, and they clearly had plastic hearts) were still full price.

In our family has spent time in many local hospitals. I've been to many here in the valley; Children's Hospital Phoenix Baptist, John C Lincoln North Mountain, Good Samaritan, and banner Thunderbird. I can unequivocally  say they give the best treatment at this pediatric  emergency room! I've been here 3 times and I don't think I'll ever take my child anywhere else.

I've used this location for the last 10 years and I've never been disappointed somehow their service is even better now than it has been in the past! They price match tires offered me water,check my air pressure without any problems. All three of our family cars get tires here

Safeway is usually a very reliable come company and I like it one of my very favorite grocery stores to shop, at this location there were people begging for money in the parking lot and when I  got home I realized that every single one of my milk & orange juices were expired and I had to make a trip back to the grocery store. What a pain in the butt. I thought I only had to check expiration dates at the Circle K, I didn't know I had to check the expiration dates at the Safeway as well, shame on you 35th Avenue and Bell Safeway

I bought two pairs of sunglasses here in the last year. One of them was last summer (less than 12 months) and the other was at Christmas time (less than 6 months).  I was buying these before Christmas time and there's only a 90 day guarantee I told the guy I was going to come back in and buy them closer to Christmas. he urged me to purchase then, & promised me that I wouldn't have a problem with them if they were in good condition and I wanted to exchange them or any other problems. He said all my information and the sunglasses would be on record in their system and he would make a note that it was for a Christmas present. Here I am 6 months later and the Dolce and Gabbana emblem came out of my glasses which are otherwise in perfect condition. Not only did he not exchange/repair them for me ...he told me I wasn't even in the system!!!!!!! He saw my name but he said he didn't see any purchase history! Which basically means I have about $500 of glasses that are not being recognized in his system & this is definitely the guy who sold me the glasses to begin with. I think he's the manager.  Sunglass Hut has good quality products but you better be careful which location you go to.

I just waited in the drive thru line for 25 minutes I ordered coffee with cream when I get to the window to pay he asks me again how many creams how many sugars and I tell him when I Drive away literally 25 minutes later there's no cream and no sugar in the coffee so frustrating I go inside and the manager is curt with me. I wouldn't bother mentioning it otherwise but this McDonalds has a dirty Playland and there's always tweakers and drug addicts waiting in the outside for their dealers ,and sleeping inside. Thanks for nothing McDonalds

I love the ice cream here! I have been coming here for ice cream cakes every year, for 16 years. I would have given  5 stars but they wouldn't honor my cake coupon because I hadn't printed it (no where on coupon did it say "must be printed") come on, customer service!

You had better check on your "free 3 day pass" SAM TRIED TO CHARGE A $20 DAY FEE EVEN THOUGH WE HAD PRINTED PASS. I would like to cancel my membership. This is the second time that I brought in a prospective member, with a paper "3 day pass" and when we arrived at the club they would not let us work out, SAM told r that it wasn't reflected in the computer I offered to pull it up on the phone we obviously had our 3 day pass with the pass ID number HL8YEG printed on paper. this is beyond irritating and completely unnecessary horrible management skills can remember and paid full price for over 7 years.Sam is the manager.I will be taking my full price membership my kids club membership and my friend to a different gym that's more accommodating

Great juice, very knowledgeable and helpful, friendly staff. The only reason I give it 5 stars was because the juice is a bit pricey.$26 or two juices and 2 shots

Always love this restaurant although it seems like the salmon in salmon salad has been reduced in size.Last night ordered sweet potato sandwich and linguine & chicken to share with friend.Just my opinion would have enjoyed a bit more savory on potato sandwich. After I ordered the sweet potato sandwich I saw cranberry turkey is back! OMG should have got that!

BE CAREFUL WHO DOES YOUR HAIR! At 3:30 and 4:30 today both I and my daughter had appointments in your salon. The services were provided by "Ollie Friedman". It had been a lovely day in your spa prior to this. We had been enjoying all of the treatments, but the experience was ruined by the final service provided by your salon. The technician yanked & pulled my hair, roughly when it was wet and fragile! Combing my hair at the top of my head instead of at the ends is obviously painful and damaging.  Elizabeth experienced the same thing. She seemed to be in a real rush. I don't mind somebody who is efficient or fast when doing my hair, but not at the expense of my hair health. She was yanking, pulling, and ripping at my hair! If she or anyone would glance at my face they would have noticed my pained grimace.  She was rushing to dry it and burned my scalp briefly with the blow-dryer. The strangest part about this is I went in there to get a deep conditioning treatment and told her about how fragile my hair was. I had so much breakage after her style, I was very disappointed.  I'm angry with myself for not getting up and walking out. I'm just at a loss to understand why a salon like yours would employ somebody who's so harsh and causing so much damage & pain. I literally feel like somebody has been grabbing and pulling out my hair. I paid for the services and tipped as well but I made my complaints known at the front desk. He didn't seem to care either he just kept saying "sorry".

Well, I ordered cina twists and chocolate chip cookie. I asked for extra icing. I was actually tempted to call back and reiterate "EXTRA ICING" but because he repeated it back to me correctly I didn't. I should have, the cookie was great but the cina twists were dry, a little overcooked and only a drizzle of icing in the bottom of box. There was literally no icing on top of the crusts. So basically I got an expensive box of hard dry pizza crust. The delivery guy had trouble finding the place so I had to walk outside.  (while baby asleep) . I STILL TIPPED OVER 20% ALL OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN OK IF I RECIEVED ENOUGH ICING :(

NJI was disappointed.I  ordered two desserts, chocolate chip cookie in the cinimontwist I ordered t with extra icing. He repeated the order to me correctly. I actually was tempted to call back and make sure they include the icing because I've had them not included in the past. I wish I would have. The order came  with no extra icing and very little extra  icing on the cinnamon twists, leaving them very dry and little overcooked. there was only a tiny little bit icing on the very bottom of the box. See for yourself! I basically received a box of over cooked pizza crust.   The delivery guy had trouble finding my place so I had to walk out to the parking lot to help him find it while the baby was asleep in the house I tipped him over 20 percent, this all would have been ok if the cinnamon sticks had adequate, ample icing.

Way to step up your game! I got two desserts both of them were hot, fresh and delicious! Delivery time was quick and they were good  from the first bite tothe last bite! I mistakenly left your good review at another Papa Johns location. Delicious,  soft, gooey hot cinna- pie and chocolate chip pie! DELICIOUS!

First massage at a school (have had professional & groupon) Michelle was amazing! Strong hands, incredible scalp massage! She made me feel very comfortable. Got a full body massage.I liked that the massage starts as soon as they call you back. (1.5 hour wait on a sunday) they don't honor digital coupons ( they have to be the ones that actually came in the mail, you can't print them out) but $25 is already a great price.They don't allow tipping which makes this is very affordable experience, I just feel bad that the technicians can't a little extra for the good work. The only drawback is that there is not really a way to make any appointments because its on a walk in basis, and they're only open on the weekends.

A real class act! Had interaction with the night manager on a Wednesday night and had all my issues resolved in a timely fashion. He also knew where all the product placement was, I'm very happy with this store!  It's lovely, and has an amazing selection; all in all 5 stars!!

I would  have had a nice day here, but some woman came in with her two kids and as she stayed yapping on her phone throuh the whole pedicure her little boy played with the spa chairs,recclining it ,lifting it up,reclining...get off spin on the other chairs walked over to the drawers near the paper towels, opened and closed every drawer,slamming them...came back to where I was getting a pedicure, played in the sink, baned on the fish tank, bitched and yelled at his mom (hispanic of course) and even though I got a babysitter to enjoy my day this disruptive kid was allowed to ruin my visit!

This was the only school that was open and taking appointments today on a Friday usually places don't even do same day appointments for a Friday.  I was thrilled not only that the salon was really beautiful and easy to walk around in, but very close to me on Bell and 7th Street. I got a technician name Victoria who did a wonderful job on my hair!

I love my soft full eyebrows, very "in"right now. They take time and explain to you in detail how to make your eyebrows look good and they also sell the products that they use on you, which I think is incredibly convenient!

Good food if you're looking for a burger joint, and fries are amazing. Located in old town Glendale, right across from the park & the library. The only drawback would be that the seating isn't very comfortable(. 3 booths,we ended up at one of the tables)

At first we were very excited to see this cute little boutique style store come to our neighborhood. we made a purchase of some cushions today and saw some outdoor furniture that we really loved came back with a truck to pick it up. the purchase was over $400 took them 45 minutes to get the boxes  they also suggested that I apply for a credit card to receive an additional 15% off which I did and was approved. After all of this they would not honor the sale price that was quoted to us on our first visit we asked to speak to a manager she was rude inconsiderate and would not honor the price that her own salesperson quoted to us not even an hour before. The store lost a $400-plus sale and we will not be shopping there any further. Try to resolve the issues with Cheryl the manager but didn't have any luck. Thanks a lot Kirkland for a credit card I don't need.

First very excited about this new store in the neighborhood. We made a purchase of some cushions here today and we're advised of a sale they were having. We went back with the truck to get the furniture  ($400 colors of furniture that they insisted the sale was 20% off but "only today") waited 45 minutes for them to find it in the warehouse. I was told I could get an additional 15% off on top of the 20% off sale they were having an  furniture today. I applied for received the credit card and then it checked out I was denied the 20% off sale that I was quoted prior to getting the truck. The manager Cheryl said that the customer service representative Susan incorrectly told me that the outdoor furniture was on sale. This is got to be the worst customer service skills I have ever experienced in my entire life. She would not honor the price and wasted over an hour of my time and now I have a credit card that I don't need thanks a lot Cheryl
