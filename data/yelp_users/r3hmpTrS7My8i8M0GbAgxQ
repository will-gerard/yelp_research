I really enjoy the food at Fired Pie I've dine at 2 different location and the food is wonderful as well as the value. This location in Awhatukee has service problems. It took them 40 min to make 2 salads and one pesto pizza to go. We order there and waited as the staff was on their personal phone. Another staff watching him. I saw a total of 6 staff and only one could put the toppings on the salads or pizza. It still came out wrong. Not sure what he others rolls are. It did seem that was to help the customer standing in front of them. It's a fun process at other locations but this one you need to come in with your patience hat on.
