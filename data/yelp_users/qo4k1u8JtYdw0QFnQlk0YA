Food was bland. Service was sloooooooooooowwwww. At one point my partner and I thought they might have been having a "team meeting" in the back because there were no servers to be found on the floor.

My sister and I have a standing "nail date" every other Sunday. I suggested we went to tip n toes because I have been to the one off of Scottsdale road and usually get exceptional services done there. I could not believe how rude the woman was to us! All we wanted was a gel manicure each and she asked us if we would be doing a solid color or French and we both said solid and she said they would only have time for one manicure. It was at around 2:30 and the salon doesn't close until 5:00 on Sundays- by no means was it busy in there AT ALL. Shocked and appalled- we walked out. I'm so embarrassed I suggested this place of business after I talked them up so much. Too bad this location isn't like the other ones in the valley. We will just go back to our favorite place in Chandler.

Queso is sooooo tasty, along with the house made chips. I also had the Pollo Relleno and it was just like my abuelas! All together it was an amazing experience and would definitely make another visit. Great service, great food and great times!
