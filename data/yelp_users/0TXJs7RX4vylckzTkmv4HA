The tile selection is amazing and the sales staff are great to work with.  Very friendly and help you with your design.  I highly recommend getting your wall and floor tile here.

Poor service and food is overpriced. The food should taste a lot better for what you pay. Also, it's really hard to get a table.

I love doing my weekly shopping here. They have great food in the bins, local fruits and veggies, and healthy food selections. The staff at the checkout counters are quick and friendly as well.
