By far one of the best all around doctor offices I've been to. From the initial call to make an appointment - the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and professional; the office - trendy, clean, and comfortable; and Dr. Lee was icing on the visit. Her knowledge along with her ability to answer all my questions plus give me additional information made me feel very comfortable. The visit was thorough but didn't leave me feeling "poked and prodded" as I normally do after going to a doctor. I recommend this office to all my friends since it is a general practice.

I should start out by saying I have worked in the restaurant industry all my life. It takes a lot to impress me. From the moment we got out of our car - the place was busy, and it smelled amazing. We walked in to a friendly hostess who was able to seat us right away.  We sat and looked over the menu for a moment when the manager came over to greet us. I thought it was because maybe our waitress was busy (double sat, getting an order, etc...). She offered us a wine sample and gave us a little history of the restaurant. She also listed out some of the house favorites. I watched the manager as the night went on and realized she greets every table! That is a really nice touch. I also noticed during our meal a busser was cleaning tables near us. He wiped down each condiment shaker, the entire table (didn't miss a spot), and the seats! Thoroughly clean - made me feel good about where I was eating. The server, Asia, came by to take our order - very nice and very hospitable. The service although a little slow was amazing how calm she seemed with a full section and how much personable service we got. She was professional and very good at all the things I look at in a server: clean appearance, genuine smile, multitasked, up-sold, invited us to come back by telling us about lunch specials and giving us a "punch card".  Overall, a great price - most pasta dishes are about $12-$16. Each meal came with a salad (better than Olive Garden's) and amazing bread. I had so much trouble picking what I wanted to eat and cannot wait to go back and try everything else. Everything tasted good, looked good, and we left full, happy and a little box of leftovers.  Overall - one of the BEST places I've eaten in the last year! Well done Riga Tony's! I am impressed and recommend anyone who likes food to eat there!

Normally I'm a 5 star (and once a 1 star) kind of girl. Tonight at lucky strike severely disappointed me. We were there to just a have good night out with friends. My friend and I arrived late. It took 26 minutes to get any kind of service (we ended up going to the bartender -who was a doll...she gets 5 stars). Got food and beers and our hour on the lane was over so we went into the soft seating area. We were trying to cash out and still hasn't seen a server -it was an hour later. I got a manager involved and the server had left, charged the card that the tab was on, and never got someone else to cover their section. The manager bought us a round and was wonderful in trying to fix everything. We were waiting to go back on a lane, and it turns out they took us off the wait list since we had a lane earlier and they "didn't think we wanted the later lane as well". They try really hard, but it's like the fart that was forced. :(

Oh.....My.....Goodness!!! Cheap and greasy and love in a bag.   We ordered ahead to-go (which was recommended by a coworker). When we got there - it was the busiest restuarant I've seen for lunch probably ever. And they were flipping tables quick. The line was fast and efficient.

Happened upon this place in my search for a kale salad for lunch. Place has a very healthy feel as you walk in (not my first thing when looking for food) but I decided to give it a shot. Menu looked appealing to what I was craving. Line was quick, staff was was SUPER friendly. She guided me through my virgin order. Got the Gangam city salad. Normally I read reviews before I try a place but was so hungry I ordered then sat to wait while I read reviews. I was worried as I read some of the lower scored reviews. I got my food and was delightfully surprised! It had ample ingredients, great flavor, plenty of dressing, and didn't take ages to get out to me. I  very pleased with my lunch choice and will be back!!

The moment you walk in, you feel welcome and important. Cannot believe they opened a short time ago! They are so established, you'd think they'd been there a decade! Super trendy and clean. I got a full face make up and walked out feeling so pretty - absolutely ready for my night on the town. Heather is skilled and almost put me to sleep she was so delicate. Anyone getting married?? They go on location!! They also do a blush rush - you come in with foundation and they do the rest. I'm super nosey so I asked a lot of questions, but they were very kind in answering everything I asked. Will go back for sure!
