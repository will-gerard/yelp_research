This small, dark restaurant is in the Ahwatukee area, in a shopping center with a Trader Joe's, Safeway, and other stores.  It is in the corner, on the same side of the shopping center as the Trader Joe's.  We go here periodically because they have decent food, and I like the staff - very friendly.  It's nice to get some saag paneer (great texture, fluffy & creamy - try it) for take-out.  They use canola oil, which saddens me, as I like ghee (I like my saturated fats & olive oil more than certain vegetable oils).  You can get decently spicy food here (that's "extremely HOT" to some of you) or skip the heat entirely.  They use good spices and make good sauces.  They don't make the most awesome Indian food I have ever had, but it is good, hearty, and comforting.  It's a good place for children, if there is something on the menu yours like (and who doesn't like ras malai or rice pudding?).  It can be good for groups, but I would call ahead or make reservations (not sure if they take them).  I appreciate how they gave me decaf tea & warm water (not just "no ice" water, but room temperature water) when I asked.  Recommended: any of their tandoori dishes; a vegetable curry that may not be on the menu but comes as a side in one of the special dinners; saag paneer; mango lassi; their relishes.  I'm good with anything on the menu.  Try the lunch buffet.

Located on the SE corner of the Kyrene and Rural intersection, in the main strip mall building, behind the Walgreen's.  At this time, the parking lot has been torn up, so be careful driving through there.  I don't have a lot of dry cleaning done, but I've had a number of things done here at what I consider reasonable prices.  I've had things dry cleaned, a pair of pants taken in at the waist in the back, and my wedding dress dry cleaned here.  I had no problems - they all came out as expected.  One time, I got a beet stain in a turquoise skirt.  They couldn't promise it would come out, but it did come out to where I can't see it.  I guess I got it in there fast enough, too!  I'm only giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't feel like they do anything particularly special.  It's more like 4.5 stars.  I've never gone price-shopping for dry cleaning - they are the closest place to my house.  It sounds like they are more expensive Avalon Cleaners.  I wish they would let me return their hangers.  I haven't suggested that or tried to give them back, but they don't ask.

I went one time for maternity clothes, though I was pretty disappointed in their maternity selection.  I'll echo other reviewers' experiences with the staff - they're pretty uninterested in the customers.  Personally, I don't like overbearing, hovering staff, but they were a little too hands-off.  It didn't matter, though.  The maternity clothes were about as awful as anywhere.  The selection was pretty poor - and who is wearing those itty-bitty short things?  Tiny Scottsdale women who barely have a bump?  Maybe I should have made a few more visits.  I managed to find 2 shirts at OK prices.

I've bought food for my 2 cats here.  A small place with nice people.  They have nice people there, and they'll take the big bag or package of cans of food out to your car.  They have good selection on better pet food (grain-free Innova Evo, etc.), dry and canned.  I also bought a powdered vitamin supplement for animals.  I'm giving them 4 stars because they don't have any of the frozen raw foods.  Because of that, I'm going to Sunflower Pet Supply now, which is closer to my house (Tempe Feed & Tack was close to my workplace).  Not sure about cat litter, but I don't remember seeing cat or dog carriers.  Don't quote me on that one - just call first.

I love this restaurant.  If you consider yourself a gourmand, one who seeks the best in life, one who searches for innovative cuisine, or just a lover of real food, you will appreciate Quiessence.  Check out their website (or call) to get a sense of the menu.  They make a magical Valentine's Day dinner (and will do it on the 13th, if you like the idea but not the extreme madness in going out for that evening).  I kept my menu and will stare at it longingly forever.  We did the wine pairing with each course, mmmmmm.  I just don't have the time and money at this point in my life to do that kind of work, so taking advantage of someone else's tastes (as long as they are excellent) is a beautiful thing to me.    Fresh ingredients - local ones where possible - and damn good ones.  Wonderful wait staff, with whom to discuss your gastronomic experience.  Setting: lovely South Mountain farm with pecan trees, which includes Maya's Farm (produce are sold at the Downtown Public Market on Saturdays) and a brunch and lunch restaurant (all 3 are in separate areas/buildings).    Quiessence is pricey but definitely worth it.  Take someone who will appreciate it.  Update, 9 September 2007: We went here for our anniversary dinner...mmm.  Just as awesome as ever.  I felt compelled to add a few things so people wouldn't be shocked when going there: - Portion sizes are fairly small, so that you can choose one of each course.  I'm sure that makes the prices (which you can find on the website under the menu) all the more shocking to some people.  To me, it's totally worth it. - This restaurant is a good way to impress other people.  Maybe your taste buds are poor, but you are rich - you should still take people here :)   - Staff tip: amazing pears from Aravaipa Farms, which has a bed & breakfast, only about 2.5 hrs drive from Phoenix (on the way to Globe) but with a different microclimate, http://www.aravaipafarms.com/  Update, May 2008:  we went again for a celebratory dinner and got the brick oven table.  I'm still so thrilled this place exists and that I can support it when my budget allows.  The brick oven table with the wine pairings is a spendy (nearly $400 for the 2 of us) but worthwhile experience.  The menu for the evening is personalized to your tastes.  In the last year, we found out one of us has a wheat allergy, and one of us has a corn allergy.  Those were some new things to accommodate, and we mentioned that when making reservations expecting it to be accommodated.  We had 8 courses and 9 glasses of wine each, over the course of 5.5 hours.  There was ample time to rest and relax in between courses, and we were stuffed when we left (but  not unpleasantly so).  You're really in your own little private world at the brick oven table...far enough from the noises of other diners to enhance your experience.  Dustin was our server for the evening, and we enjoyed all the info he shared about the ingredients in the food and the wines.  Some of the wine pairings were extraordinary with the food.  Some were surprising (one that tasted like its Spanish coastal terroir, served with shellfish).  There were a few things that disappointed me, though.  Our allergies were forgotten a few times, though when that happened, replacement food was brought out promptly.  For the most part, our allergies were attended to well.  However, dessert sort of ruined things.  We were initially brought a selection of lovely cake-like and crust-laden desserts.  I mentioned the wheat.  They were replaced with two citrus sorbets, one grapefruit, one lemon, and lemon creme brulees.  This was served with tawny port.  No no no!  All that sour citrus...and port??  I let them know that didn't work at all.  Surely something could have been made - a flourless chocolate cake, perhaps?  The lemon creme brulee on its own would have been fine, but with all of that mouth-puckering sorbet...I still love the place, I'm still glad it exists, the service is superior, and I love the use of wonderful-tasting, fresh, local ingredients, but that dessert didn't work.  Thank goodness for the other 7 courses (including a whole fish we picked clean...in addition to our meat course).  In spite of the poor dessert choices this time around, I'm convinced that people who think their food is "overpriced" or "overrated" have poor palates and probably rarely venture outside of chain restaurants, where the food is laden with corn syrup, MSG, and other fake flavors.  Every main course I've had there was outstanding.

This is standard Mexican fare for the area.  Unfortunately, that doesn't mean it's good.  Generally, I eat the best food at home.  We have raw milk, raw butter, and raw cheese.  My husband of Mexican lineage cooks fabulous New Mexican food when he can procure true chiles from New Mexico.  We buy very fresh fruits and vegetables and meat from pastured animals or wild fish and shellfish. So whenever I go out to a "Mexican restaurant," I don't expect anything as good as I get at home.  Even so, I can't tolerate this stuff.  I ate lunch there, and it's sat in my gut like a rock ever since (5.5 hours now).  I had salsa & chips, and the enchilada trio (I believe I had a cheese one, a chicken one, and a pork one).  A $13 entree for lunch, which wasn't very good - too much for me to pay for something I can't digest very well.  Everything had an odd flavor, like it wasn't quite real food.  Yes, I only went once, and I won't be going back.

This dairy sells fresh milk, straight from the cow.  That's what they're licensed to sell.  They use organic feed (dried grasses), hydrogen peroxide for cleaning certain things, and iodine to clean the cows' teats (just like many dairies used to).  They want the cows to be out on pasture, but they need a bigger piece of land to do so.  If you know of a piece of land in the area, please suggest it to Jackie Calamos.  I love their milk.  As of this date, milk is $10/gallon, the true cost of the milk (or maybe even a little low).  Most of the milk you buy in the store isn't worth the price.  Forcing more production out of cows with hormones comes at the cost of quality (and your health).  SYD's has all the good stuff (the proof is in the taste).  It's never made us sick, and we've been drinking it for 2 years.  It's a miracle that this metro area actually has a dairy willing to sell fresh milk to the public!  Thank you, Save Your Dairy!

This is a great little place to get some coffee and a snack, and to hang out.  The employees make the place nice - they're friendly and prompt.  They have good coffee, but lately I get herbal teas for personal reasons.    I've been gluten-free since September 2007, and they don't offer a ton of options for that, but what coffee house does?  They have a GF granola and snack bar (at least, it didn't set me off; they can't guarantee it's gluten-free).  Wheaty options include sandwiches and pastries; other foods include yogurt, Naked juices, bananas, and apples.  They have organic products when possible.  The temperature inside is fine.  Not too many comfy chairs and such, but there are chairs and tables for hanging out, working, reading, etc.  They mitigate those office-like fluorescent lights with cute covers.  There's art for sale on the walls, like other independent coffee houses.  Why 4 stars, not 5?  It's just not that awesome an experience to come here, but I don't know what I'm looking for in a coffee house for 5 stars.  Nothing personal for Bunna.  I'm glad they're here.  Hours vary according to the ASU student population.  Expect early closings in the summer.

The store is large, roomy, clean, and attractively decorated, even though it bears more of a resemblance to a giant supermarket than some of the Whole Foods stores I've been in (in other states).  They have a decent selection of the stuff I'm looking for.    Their wine selection isn't extensive, but there are some gems hidden in there, as well as in their beer aisle (or so I hear...I can't drink regular beer anymore).  They have organic and biodynamic wines, though.  One of the things I appreciate most is having a good wine guide in the store, and I've found Jim to be extremely helpful and full of stories to tell.  The store hosts food and wine events regularly, none of which I've attended (though they look good from a distance).  In other alcoholic choices, they have some gluten-free beers, but I'm not impressed with any gluten-free beers I've tried.    Then there's the rest of the store.  I can usually find the gluten-free grains or flours I'm looking for.  I appreciate that they sell some grains, beans, etc. in bulk 25 pound bags, like organic pinto beans.  They have a good meat selection, an OK produce area, and what appears to be a dwindling seafood selection (guess people aren't buying that stuff so much anymore).  I can go in and get a lettuce-wrapped burger at the grill counter...just not too late (I think the counter closes at 7).    There are a few disappointments.  The hot food buffet has a so-so selection.  The salad bar always looked pretty sad to me.  I notice there aren't a lot of organic choices in the take-out prepared foods...or in the dessert case...hmm.  I don't like how often canola oil appears in their prepared foods (I prefer olive oil and animal fats).  Lots of ordinary stuff is overpriced compared to other stores.  A note to those with food allergies:  I've encountered mislabeled items in the prepackaged foods, in the dessert cases, take-out, deli, etc.    On a high note, they take nearly anything back (not books & magazines).  I've even taken back some nasty wine.  There are some cool, friendly employees, too.

I have 2 cats.  I don't like these people.  Every time I've been there, I feel they charge me too much.  I don't like the advice they give.  I hate how they send me a million reminder letters - what a waste of money for them to mail. I've switched to Dave & Rick's Dog & Cat Repair on Rural Rd (Rural & Elliot), and I feel a whole lot better.

I have 2 cats, and I love this place.  I buy them things like Innova Evo (dry and canned) and Nature's Variety frozen raw meat medallions, which are difficult to find.  I can get the Evo at the Tempe Feed & Tack, but they don't have a freezer for the other food.  Sunflower even has the canned duck, which one of my cats inhales.  Previously, I was going all the way out to In the Raw in Gilbert for the frozen stuff, ugh!  I'm so thrilled this little place opened!  It's not too far from my house, and the owner is awesome.  Great product selection.  Closed on Sunday.

Still great.  She sells World's Best Cat Litter (made with corn; I wasn't impressed with it when I tried it a few years ago), and Close to Nature (made with soybeans), which she recommends over WBCL.    Why not the standard clay litter?  It's got a very fine dust that gets into the cat's lungs and yours, and it contains aluminum, which isn't good for anyone's brain.  Also, corn and soybeans are biodegradable industrial waste products.  However, they're probably pesticide-loaded.  Can't win!  I'm looking for something that clumps and controls odors decently, though.  I love talking to the owner.  She's super-nice and super-knowledgeable.
