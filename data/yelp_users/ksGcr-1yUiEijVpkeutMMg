I'm a Huge fan of this Starbucks!!! It has awesome outdoor seating and if someone is smoking (which they are not supposed to) You can ask the manager and they will have the smoker stop immediately. My family loves coming here and it's great for business meetings too!

My family and I Love this Lowes!!! It is super accessible off Bell and Grand and the people are always friendly and very helpful! We especially enjoy the garden department, the employees always point us in the right direction for what we need to keep our plants, flowers and trees looking good!

I don't know what has happened to this place, but the last two times we've been here, the food took forever to get, it was the incorrect food order and it was cold!!! #NotGood #WhatHappened #GetNewManagementPlease

Horrible experience tonight!!! My wife and I came in for one item, the standard check out lines were packed and understaffed with cashiers so we went through the quick check out and our one item rang up at twice the price with our Frys card. We had to wait five minutes for an attendant to help us and correct the problem. She was extremely rude and treated us like we were the problem, not their system. We will be shopping at Safeway right across the street from now on.

Horrible customer service! I went in there and there was only one person working and he was talking to another customer. The employee did not acknowledge me at all while I walked around for five minutes and then I left. While walking out the door, the employee said have a nice day. The sad thing is I am a customer looking for R/C car parts and batteries. I guess I won't be purchasing anything from this store.

Wow, the service here seems to be getting worse and worse! They seem to have a revolving door of new people working here and today my wife ordered a white chocolate mocha. When we went outside to sit down and enjoy our drinks the barista had made a mocha instead even though the cup had WM on it. When I nicely went inside to get the correct drink made, the barista said "oh my bad" and then remade it without ever saying sorry and then said "here you go" to me when handing the freshly made drink to me. I don't get it??? Is this what customer service has come to??? I'm Very disappointed and will look for another coffee shop in Surprise to go to with my family

This was out first time here and I came because of the good yelp reviews. Wow, this place is Awesome and the baristas are super helpful!!! They let me sample their white coffee and made me a special drink based on what I told them I was in the mood for! Great place and we will be back!

Jeff Roche is a Great contractor and really knows what he is doing.  With our home projects, Jeff showed up early and ensured to job was completed to our satisfaction!  I think Jeff can pretty much fix anything with a home inside and out.  I would recommend him to everyone I know.  Keep up the Great work Jeff and when Michelle has another project, I'll be sure to call You! - Mike
