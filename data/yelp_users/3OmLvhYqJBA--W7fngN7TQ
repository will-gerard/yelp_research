Ate here again this morning, and again got something slightly different than what I ordered. The food is mediocre at best, and the service leaves much to be desired.

Really good food, at a great value. I've seen the owner just about every time I've been. That's a sign of a great place to me. The portions are rather large so it's a good place to go for yummy leftovers.

I love the food & coffee here. The owner & staff are always friendly, and love to chat. I've sampled most of the menu, and have yet to be disappointed.  There are tables, power outlets, & wifi, which makes for a good place to stop in for a few hours & work. (Just don't be a wifi-freeloader, the coffee gods will smite you!)  The only real "con" is their hours. I would love to be able to stop by on my way home & grab a cup of coffee, but they close so early :(

Wife & I stopped in for breakfast at the recommendation of some friends. Waited almost 10 minutes before someone took our drink order, so we ordered food as well. After waiting another 30 minutes, without drinks, we got up and left.

Entire rental experience was a complete disaster. Rent somewhere else.
