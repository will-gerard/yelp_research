we stayed at the buttes for the BCS national championship game last week, and it was great!  the beds are super comfortable and the grounds are really cool - hot tubs are hidden all over the place, and i wish it was warm enough to swim in the pool because it looked really nice as well.    the hotel was built on the side of a "mountain" so it has a lot of stairs and isn't exactly wheel chair friendly (there are a few ramps and elevators, but the elevator in our building didn't even go up to the 3rd floor, so stairs were a must), but taking the scenic route to the market cafe was not only good exercise, but very pretty too.    I had to knock off a star because the service at the market cafe was really slow...even when there were only a handful of people in the restaurant.  And the fancy restaurant on top of the hotel with the nice view was closed on sunday, which was weird since the hotel was completely booked.  but overall, i recommend the buttes!

oh 5th and wine, i like your name, but it felt more like 5th and whine....the service was terrible.  very very slow...after dropping off the tab we tried to get the waiter's attention for 30min, to no avail, so ended up having to pay cash so we could leave.  the art on the walls was cool though.  and my grilled cheese sandwich was good, but the dressing on my salad tasted like dish water, which was awkward.  i wouldn't go back, there are so many restaurants in that area to choose from, i recommend choosing another one.
