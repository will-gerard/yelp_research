We have been going here for years! Since the wait can be a little long at the restaurant we usually order takeout and it's ready within twenty min! The chicken Parmesan is delicious - the meal includes a side salad and garlic bread for about $11, can't beat it! I also love their veggie americano sandwich - the sub roll is super good and always fresh! Sometimes the staff can be a little rude but I think it's just because they're always busy, but I don't like feeling rushed when ordering and at times they can be impatient. Overall a wonderful place!

Janelle is an amazing hair stylist and color specialist. I've never been given more compliments on my hair then when I started seeing her a few years back. The salon itself is fun and funky... they offer treats at the front, I always enjoy red vines and pretzels :) It's a clean atmosphere with friendly staff.

I always enjoy grabbing an iced or hot vanilla latte at Cartel. Definitely one of the best places for baked goods, their banana bread is to die for! The staff is much friendlier here than the Tempe location. It's a wonderful atmosphere and when the weather is nice it's great to sit out on the patio.

Sam is a true massage therapist! By far the most amazing massage I've ever had, and I'm a former member of Massage Envy (gag!) You cannot beat the quality and the price... $30 for an hour. It was incredible. I will be going back once a month!

Had an amazing experience here this past weekend... my manicure was flawless, they were very friendly and detailed in their work. I was so happy with the results and the price! Only $11 for a basic manicure. Not the most beautiful atmosphere but that's my only criticism! Definitely give it a try, I'll be going back.

Because of the fairly good reviews on Yelp we decided to give this a shot tonight... to say we were disappointed is an understatement. I called ahead to make sure it was kid-friendly... the woman on the phone said there was no kids menu (totally fine) but that there were plenty of high chairs so come on in. When we arrived we were greeted by two gentlemen who seemed apprehensive to seat us (probably because we had a one year old with us... who might I add is very well behaved at restaurants, otherwise we wouldn't go out.) After five minutes of waiting for them to find us a table (it was dead) they sat us at the very last table right next to the restrooms. Our waitress was friendly and recommended a few items. We ordered the pretzel and chicken wings for apps, cocktails and a burger and the bolognese. The drinks were the highlight of the evening, we ordered a margarita, the mule and the whiskey shandy. We were brought our entrees, a fairly small portion for bolognese in my opinion... my husband's was cold and the pasta wasn't fully cooked. After letting our waitress know, ten min later they brought him a new one. Unfortunately the plate was on fire but the food was barely warm. The bolognese was nothing to write home about... just OK. My brother's burger was again, just OK and the side salad was mediocre at best. We brought it to the wait staff's attention that we would like the apps taken off the bill since our waitress never brought them... she was very nice and sincere in her apology, apparently it was her first night - they comped his bolognese. We won't be going back.

Beautiful space at a fun location... staff is friendly and laid back. By far the best espresso drinks in the valley!

Finally, something different and exciting for a quick meal! We have been four or five times now and been very satisfied. The staff is warm and inviting and the restaurant is very clean and aesthetically pleasing. Most times we get the glazed beef over brown rice and the grilled zucchini. Very tasty!
