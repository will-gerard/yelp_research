It's dangerous having an office located in downtown Scottsdale. The proximity to restaurants and watering holes can easily lead to lengthy lunches and copious amounts of cocktails. Now that Rancho Pinot has added a weekday lunch menu, I fear my productivity level just dropped.   Although it seems this place has fallen off the foodnik radar, the stellar Arizona-accented cooking is still earning the "5-STARS" awarded by the Republic. A delectable new lunch menu makes it even more accessible.    Heading inside, you'll see that kitsch is king.  Imagine cowboys, comics, saguaro ribs, and white table cloths. It's a dreamy culture clash of whimsy to match the eclecticism of the cuisine.   Brandishing his bola tie, bartender Travis Nass is on a mission to elevate the city's cocktail scene. He makes his own... well... everything. His bar is stocked little vials and vessels (pictured) containing homemade concoctions and bartender essentials.   His perfect Manhattan provoked this tweet to @kkrader, "I had a cocktail today that made me quiver. That good, or I just had the alchy shakes. I'm ok w either."   Add in lunch from Chef Chrysa and I'm still shaking.

Sorry, this one's a bit harsh for me!   To sum it up.. one  (just one) 8.5 x 14 text print cost me $30 bucks!  Since our office is practically next door, we keep going back to save travel time in tight pinches. Sorry Alphagraphics, I think it's time for us to split up.  Print quality: Unpredictable. When I'm paying $30 bucks for a sheet of paper, it better be executed well. Use of  "more-efficient" equipment equals smeary images and inaccurate color.  Time to completion: Very good. Always on-track with delivery estimate.   Customer service: Poor. Staff is unfamiliar with print industry demands. When calling, expect to be passed from person to person trying to find someone with decent work experience to talk shop. (Yes, I know it's a "copy shop", but at these prices you'd better know your stuff)  Personality: Generally friendly young staff.   Pricing: Insane. Working in the industry, I know these prices are ridiculous. If I felt I was working with professionals with professional equipment, I would absolutely pay for excellent service. Sadly, I'll have to look elsewhere.  I've sent dozens of jobs with a variety of specs through these folks. Each experience has been with the quality of collateral.

Love this joint! A simple margherita pizza is my test for good pizza places. Often, it's the "simplest" dishes that are the most difficult to execute. Classic Italian won't disappoint! This is my East-Valley pick for best pizza.   Although they have a full bar, they don't stock Campari. Just a personal taste I have, I suppose. There's not much to brag about the scene. With zero street visibility, no proximity to night life/culture and hidden in an half-empty strip mall, the restaurant must rely on its great  food to sustain business. (not a bad business model... others should take note!)  Hit Classic Italian purely for the food and it's an easy winner! Staff is friendly and the pizza is about as good as it gets in the Valley.

Man oh man... Jack Daniels Sangria! I know I should write about the food, but the drinks here are great too! Impressive tequila selection and inventive cocktails support the raves reviews on the cuisine here.  On a personal note, I had a chance to chat with Sylvana (the owner) who is just incredible. Food and dining is in her her blood... literally! Her ancestors were royal pastry chefs.   She committed to strengthening the local community through her food. There's heart behind her cooking which keeps me coming back again and again.   Specifically, any of the seafood dishes are killer!

So just how great is this hotel?  1. I live about 5 miles south and I've booked 3 long weekends in the next couple months. Locals would call it a staycation, but because of the hotel's stylish rooms, close-to-everything location and top-notch service, it always feels like a dreamy out-of-town vacation.  2. As public relations professional, I'm often asked about my favorite spots to stay in Scottsdale. The Hotel Valley Ho is always my must-book recommendation. In fact, our entire staff stays here as a group a few times a year.   3. It's the definition of fun, energetic hospitality. Pamper yourself with a bedside dinner, or meet new friends at the pool over cocktails. No matter where you are on the property, an upbeat hotel representative is there to make the stay uh-amazing.   Always.

Hands down, one of my top 5 favorite stores! Home accents, furniture, accessories, artwork, lighting, and above all... expert interior design service. Debbie has pulled together an eclectic mix of the the type of pieces that anyone would brag about owning!   Each piece has a wonderful story behind it... just ask her! The story is clearly the reflection of a passionate business owner who loves well-designed pieces.  Custom lacquered chandeliers, handmade hate-mail cards (oh yes,) luxurious bedding, antique wall art... I could go on!  Just go see for yourself!

Shoe heaven for men.  These guys know their stuff. Custom sneaks, awesome service, and a new location near fashion square. I'm not a fashion buff, but shoes and glasses are my specialty.  I swear I'm putting these guys' kids through college with the number of shoe's I've bought here. Previously, I bought most of my shoes online due to lack of in-store options. Other than the occasional slickdeals.net specials... where's the fun in shoe shopping online?  Check out High Point for hard-to-find Nike, Adidas, Creative Recs, and more. Many are limited editions.

When I grow up. I want to be Eliot Wexler.  Even when his acclaimed restaurant is closed for Superbowl Sunday, he's answering the phones to make sure each guest talks to a live person.  The master restaurateur picked up the ringer when I called for a last-minute dinner reservation tonight. He politely explains that they are closed and offers a reservation for another night.  Wow.  Not only was he cool enough to give his staff the night off (...and the subsequent hangover Monday), he personally takes over the customer service to make sure guests are accommodated.  This is not unusual for NOCA.  The ever-perfectionist Eliot often answers the phone for his own restaurant and personally oversees the first impressions of all dining experiences at NOCA.  What about the food? You don't need me to talk about it. The endless local and national reviews cover that. It's epic.  I've dined here many times and I will always be fan.  Watch out Eliot. I'm taking notes. When I open my restaurant... will I be a friend or a formidable adversary?  Love, your JuxtaPalate pal.

Trust me... no one wants this place to do well more than me. However, after 4 visits I have to confess that it is a solid 2-stars. I'm confident in my comments... and maybe a little heartbroken.  1. Loved Chef Wade Moises when he was at SASSI in Scottsdale. I'm a fan for god's sake.  2. I'm a big pasta-crazed fool. Seriously love it.    3. Love dwntwn Phx.  So what could go wrong?   Service:  No one to greet you properly at the door. The space is awkward enough as it is.  Staff was always inattentive and often seen hanging out at the bar. When asked why cocktails the "signature cocktails" took so long to prepare, the server responds clumsily "Because I had to read and learn how to make them just now." Yikes.  Back to the greeting... We waited about 2 minutes in the doorway listening to staff sitting at the bar chat about how they hoped they could close early that night. It was only 4:30 pm.  Vibe: The space feels cold and almost clinical. With the lack of fabric in the space, it feels like I'm the ER of a hospital (minus the curtains that surround each patient bed.) The staff certainly doesn't add warmth. Also reminds me of a corporate staff break room. Art on the walls is just bizarre (read other's comments.)  The Cocktails: They look good on paper. See my comment above about Service. That's all I can really say.   The Food: Each time, the Fritto Misto app ($9) was salty and sad to look at. Orecchiette with Sausage ($15) looks fantastic on paper, but never quite right.   In fact, I've tried every pasta dish on the menu. I'm simply heartbroken. I crave handmade fresh pasta, but the pasta here just leaves me guessing... I'm I the odd ball out? Why do all these Yelpers love the pasta? It's wimpy and the proteins almost taste boiled (texture and flavor.) Approx quote from a guest, "gummy handmade pasta that looks like bloated playdoh in water." The sauces seem near amateur as if they were never tasted before serving. Usually on the salty side.  Forget about portions, price, space, ambiance, whatever. The important question... DOES IT TASTE GOOD?   Sadly, no.  At each visit, I brought other notable chefs from the Valley. In one instance, the five of us ordered an entire dinner, ate a few bites of each dish, asked for the bill and decided to head next door to Sens for dinner (which is another review in the making.)  I'll wait till sometime in the fall season before heading back to Pasta Bar. Maybe it needs more time (although it's been open for a few months already.)   As always, I'd encourage you to try it out and make your own decision. Wade is a talented chef who can do amazing things in the kitchen. I have faith in you my friend!  Side note... for those of you who fixate on butter and bread service at restaurants, do us all a favor and stick to your cheap filler salad bars. Bread and butter service is simply never worth commenting on as a crucial component of a meal unless it's stellar.  (BTW... I realize the irony of making commentary on the worthless comments)

Me encantan Puerto Rican food... and this place hits the spot. During my college internship in Florida, I fell madly in love with a Puerto Rican and was introduced to the soulful cuisine of the island.  Since then, I've trimmed the fat (literally, the overweight ex-lover) and kept my infatuation with the cooking.  My modest attempts to prepare traditional dishes at home are now moot since El Coquito does it so well. The affordable mom-n-pop joint offers all the favorites, earning a loyal following of transplanted New York Puerto Rican families and wannabe borincanos like myself.  Important: This is a BYOB spot. You must prepare accordingly.  (See an illustration of the "Rum Purse" at http://bit.ly/aBH6oT)  If you're a true foodie, you already carry a stylish "Rum Purse," pictured above. Any brown paper bag will do. Simply stock it with your favorite bottles of rum and carry it anywhere you go. The Rum Purse guarantees instant popularity in any situation, especially at a Puerto Rican restaurant that serves a signature "virgin" coconut cocktail (The Coquito) that begs to be bathed in liquor.  If you're lucky (like we were), the server will have a freshly inked tattoo exposed on her back. The sight of an exposed open wound might be a bit much, but trust me, the food is worth the damage to your eyes.  Once your rods and cones have recovered, you're in for a regional treat. One could munch on the appetizers of plantains, cod fritters and pastelillos (empanadas) alone. But then you'd miss out on family favorites including roast pork (my fave), marinated steak strips and pollo guisado. Pick your choice of rice plus pigeon peas, pink beans or black beans.  DO: Order the Coquito virgin cocktail and spice it up with the contents of your "Rum Purse."  DON'T: Let the sometimes slow service distract you from the worthwhile food. It's really that good.  DO: Mention that you love the Yankees! The owners are Puerto Rican NY'rs love the Yankees.  DON'T: Utter the word "Mets."  DO: Take a moment to peek in the window of Bennies Back Alley Barbershop next door. It's the Taj Mahal of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia. (very bizarre)  DO: Visit El Coquito often. Just ignore the Lisa Frank tattoos.

When I die, there will be with a smear of Camembert on my lips and salami in my riggored hand.  Come to Petit Fromage and come here often.   Stand in front of the display case for about 15 minutes like I did and let the thoughtful selection of unique meats and cheeses inspire a week's worth of dishes.   Will be back soon, but not soon enough. Extra points for the eye candy working the cheese counter.

60 minutes felt like 60 luxurious hours. Nearing the end of the dreadful 2009 year, I desperately needed a massage stimulus package. A retweet from a trusted friend tipped me off that Space Massage Studio had a few openings that very weekend.  After one visit, I'm hooked. Whenever I need a midday breather, I'll close my eyes and dream of this recuperative experience.  LOCATION:  Space is across the street and around the corner from the crosshairs of the LGO phenomenon. Lucky me, I've had a chance to visit several the Valley's multi-million dollar spas, but each one lacks a little soul. However, Space is located inside the humble abode of master massage therapist John Hill. I can only dream of having such prime locale for a home, let alone a business.   INTRO:  Ring the door bell and John invites you into his home. He's genuinely interested in your day and asks about your lifestyle, physical needs, special requests, habits and personal interests. The causal intro makes you feel relaxed and welcomed like a returning dinner guest.   We chatted about life in Arizona, business, busy lifestyles and desperate need to unwind and indulge in a restorative massage.  THE STUDIO:  After you've enjoyed the B&B-like hospitality, John leads you next door to the massage studio where a serene setting with diffused natural light, warm wood floors, relaxing music and delicately scented candles await. The expert attention to detail is evident as all five senses are instantly relaxed when you step into the studio.   Everything is customized.  John asks me about my music preference, desired room temperature, lighting... nothing is left to chance. Everything is about my needs.   THE MASSAGE: 60 minutes felt like 60 hours. Using the consultation, he mapped out a battle plan to conquer my ailments. John zeros in on the problem areas but also hits the unexpected spots that truly alleviate my tension and stress.   This is ultra-comfort and affordable (mandatory) luxury.  EMBARRASSING MOMENT:  I'm a terrible customer. I failed to read the "cash or check preferred" statement on Space Massage Studio's site! John was kind enough offer an alternative PayPal payment option, but to my horror... it didn't work. Nor did my debit card withdrawal at LGO's dreaded ATM! John never fretted during the entire situation. In fact, he just smiled and suggested I mail him a check at my convenience. Long story short, I left, then returned 15 mins later with the cash in hand. He was a saint.  WHY I LOVE IT: Visiting Space is like visiting a friend's house for dinner. You're instantly welcomed and pampered as an honored guest. Warning: After your massage session, you'll be haunted by wonderful dreams of specialized treatments, John's charming personality and traditional hospitality.   WHY YOU'LL LOVE IT: You'll make a new friend.  I did.

Really enjoyed this 24/7 taco spot. Great to have it in the neighborhood. Clean, bright, tasty and serves alcohol.   What's not to love?  PS --- To the Yelpers who say "meh" in any of their reviews online, time to find a new word.

Taro Boba Tea! This lavender-colored libation is my fave now that temps are in the 100's. Paired with the Korean mac and cheese --- boom.   And who thoughts crispy brussels sprouts would be a must have at an Asian spot? Order them.
