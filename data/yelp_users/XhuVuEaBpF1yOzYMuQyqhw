This was the WORST EXPERIENCE I've ever had! It took 45 minutes to get our food. Ask the manager to come over and he did not care. One of our friends didn't even get his food at all. As we were leaving the hinge fell off the door and almost hit one of our children's heads walking out the door. I can tell you none of the three family that we were with every back to this location.!

OMG!!! THIS IS THE BEST "FAST FOOD" TYPE LOBSTER BAR EVER!  There are so many choices that include lobster! Lobster mac and cheese, lobster grilled cheese, lobster rolls, lobster bisque, lobster tail on a stick!, etc... I was in heaven.   It was a tiny bit pricey but honestly what isn't overpriced in Vegas?   WORTH EVERY PENNY!

Service was sooooo terrible. Waitress was nice but we had already gotten and finished our appetizer before she ever came back to take our order. I had to ask the Manager to take it.  The food took forever, but that wasn't her fault.  I asked for butter, never got it, I asked for the check she then went and took another table's order, went and got food, etc.... I finally went and found her and handed her my card.    The manager was so busy apologizing to everyone that he was no help.   Probably lost my business as there are so many other places to eat and much cheaper. Food was so expensive. I had probably what was about a cup of nooodles, 4 shrimp and 3 scallops for $22.  We had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 extra side salad. $65.  CRAZY! !

This place is eclectic and delishious.  It is a gas station, car wash, BBQ place and eclectic store all in one.   Everything in the place is for sale, even the seats you sit on to eat!  So fun.  Best mac and cheese. Supposedly the best BBQ too. I don't eat meat so I can't rate it, but my family and friends love it!!!

Great burger joint!  Staff is young but attentive and trained well.  Food is great! Food is fresh and made everyday.  I love the turkey burgers. The shake of the month is fantastic!  Sydney M. is so kind and helpful. She will go out of her way to assist you with your needs.

Don't get me wrong, the food is very good but holy crap the service is soooo terrible.  It took them 5 times to make my son's sandwich correctly and all he did was ask them to substitute mayo for the honey mustard.   They never offered him anything for our inconvenience, we were all done eating by the time his sandwich was made correctly.  Ok so I was hoping it was a one time thing but of course I was wrong.  Again, this time my husband's food was messed up.  Their excuses were just that they were training.  And again, they don't care, just say sorry. I so love the cauliflower soup but my family won't go back.

This is our first time in this location and I will never be back.  The place is filthy, I mean almost too dirty to stay and eat.  There are only 6 customers here.  It took forever to take our order cuz the 2 guys that were workers were playing around on a computer and ignored us standing there.  I specifically asked if they were still open because it appeared we were bothering them.  He said, no, we're open til 10pm, "we're just tired".    My food came out wrong and didn't taste good and I'm just done!  GROSS!
