Phenomenal sushi!  We had another incredible dinner last night.  The quality is simply the best in Phoenix.   This is not a chic, trendy scene like some of the clubs pretending to be sushi bars. This is a simple, quiet, nice, comfortable, little spot with excellent sushi as well as other traditional Japanese food.  It's as fresh as it gets and Yuki and EJ are truly talented at creating the most delicious sushi offerings you could ever hope to eat.  I highly recommend that you give it a try.

Unfortunately it was recently sold and is no longer the wonderful gem it once was. Very sad.  Don't waste your time or money here.

Awful... not even mediocre. I am giving them one star out of sheer awe that they have managed to stay open this long.  I am shocked at the positive reviews and can only surmise that the owners have lots of family and friends or there are a lot of folks in this area who just don't know any better.

Nice, hip little joint!   If you live nearby, please give it a try and support this great addition to the neighborhood.  If you live not so near, it's just a short hop off the 51at Shea and worth it!

Very cute concept...but unfortunately that is the only good thing I can say.  4 of us went for dinner prior to a Suns game and they could not handle the crowd.  This is a fast casual Italian concept - order at the counter, find a table and they bring the food to you - should be in and out.  We waited 20 or so minutes in line and then grabbed a table.  Another 30 minutes passed before the first entree was delivered.  Another 20 minutes later two more entrees arrived and 5 minutes later we received the final entree.  Unfortunately the food was mediocre at best.  We had a 12" pepperoni pizza, two orders of ravioli with creamy tomato sauce (the ravioli on one order had hard edges) and the chicken saltimbocca.   It was edible, it was fine, but it's not worth further description.    There were many, very unhappy customers and very little effort by management to assuage anyone.  While on the subject of management, you would think that in crisis mode you would see all hands on deck in hustle mode, however that was not at all the case.  There was a manager and another employee just standing at the counter and looking around toward the end of the rush while a few customers were waiting for food and tables.  The table next to us vacated and it was 20 minutes before it was bussed.  Bizarre.  We overheard a manager (I think)  talking to some other customers and explaining that this is the third time they've experienced this kind of service break down at dinner due to the crowd.  Really?  You are a hop and a skip from US Airways Arena.  I'm pretty sure your business model was banking on that when the location was chosen.  However after two previous dinner service failures it didn't occur to you to check the downtown calendar, staff up and fix any other issues on the line?  I really wanted to like this place.  Big time fail.

Excellent meal! Cheese plate was wonderful - mostarda, grilled dates and a perfect trio of cow, goat and sheep cheese selections.      Gnocchi - Phenomenal, fluffy pillows of perfection in a beautiful pork Ragu.  Fettuccine with lemon, olive oil, Parmesan and kale - hello summer! And last but not least - lovely, melt in your mouth meatballs! Love it!

Sam Fox does it again!  In fact, in my opinion, this is his best endeavor yet! I've been excitedly awaiting the opening of The Yard and it exceeded my expectations.  The well rounded culinary dropout menu has several solid new additions including a very nice Crispy Shrimp Caesar.  The antipasti is as solid as they get.  Great variety - love the beautiful presentation of yummy tete de moine cheese, and the roasted beets are delicious!    Solid food and beverage is key, but what really sends this place over the top is the space.  It is notably large but the use of the space is just absolutely cool!  Great indoor/outdoor feel.  The huge game area on the patio is outstanding!  Lots of cornhole/bag toss and bocce courts and several ping pong tables!  With the addition of more tv's coming on the patio, this will be the place to come watch a game and play some games.    Lots of parking in the back and plenty of bicycle racks on the patio for those who want to roll in on two wheels.  Very excited for the upcoming addition of Lil' Cleo's Fish House and Oyster Bar and also a coffee shop coming in the near future.  This place is just pure, tasty fun!  Go and see for yourself.

So very excited about the addition of this new gem to our neighborhood!  Great atmosphere and very cool decor...but the food...oh my!  Absolutely outstanding!  The nachos are in a class all their own.  The PBLT - that's PB for PORK BELLY, is one sassy sandwich.  Everyone seems to be doing pork belly these days, but not everyone is doing it so well.  This was so, so good!  My favorite, hands down, was the Crispy Rock Shrimp appetizer with cheddar grits, tomatillo sauce, green apple gastrique and tomatillo sauce with the most scrumptious little nuggets of crispy pork belly you could ever hope to taste.  My husband and I both agree that this is one of the best dishes we have ever tasted anywhere.    The bar is also very fun and had some amazing looking concoctions that we'll have to try in the future.  The atmosphere is sexy and rustic, with brick and reclaimed wood and feels like a dark, cool oasis that will be a great spot to escape from the summer heat.  Featuring housemade moonshine in mason jars with all kinds of tempting combos like Apple Pie and Blackberry Peach it may be hard to choose, but I think the one with my name on it the next time will be the Tito's Mojito.  Our little neck of the woods is really taking shape with Bootlegger's joining our other favorites 32 Shea and Sala Thai.   Maybe we'll be the next culinary hub!  That said, even if it wasn't in my backyard, I would frequent this new gem!   Go here.  You need this.

Fantastic!  Seriously some of the most delicious pizza around.  Great family spot.  Awesome local beer selection and decent wine list.
