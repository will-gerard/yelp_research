This is my new favorite spot. I decided to take the advice from yelpers and try this place out myself. The prices are very reasonable, the two sisters are real  nice, my nails are too cute. I couldn't be more satisfied. If you've  never been here,  this is the place to go.This place is a keeper for sure. Two thumbs up .

Our noodles were more on the uncooked side. The food had some taste , but I wouldn't come here again.

Drive down here hoping for some actual KBBQ .  I thought the prices were over priced, but the lunch special prices were reasonable . Miso soup was cold and tasted so bland. It was like sipping on water w/tofu inside. They seemed to be short staffed. So unless I actually lived in the area I wouldn't come back.

The employees there are nice . The place is clean and well designed for kids. It is totally somewhere you want to take ur kids to go and have their haircut.

Food was super tasty, especially cus they don't use MSG. I would come here every week for lunch if I could. This is a place I would have to stop in when I'm on this side of town. I love how all the employees are super nice & friendly. Prices were decent and not over priced like other places are. This place is a must try or else ur just missing out.

After reading all the reviews I was sorta sketchy about coming here. I work near by n I had some extra comp time so I took an extended lunch to try out this place n e ways. So I went in and got a full set. They were friendly and the prices were fair. I had Huey do my nails. Just remember ur always unsure when u try out a new place whether it's a new eatery, nail salon, spa, but how will u know if you'll like it or not if u don't try it out? Anyhow, Let me just say, I will be a happy returning customer. U can only judge if u try it out urself. Right?

My mini late night w/ my hubby. Was the best experience that we had there. Our server Jesse was the the best server that we had for the many times we came. Food is delish.  Tonight we had something different, the salmon salad. Normally I'm not a fan of salad, but I think next time i gotta have it again. I always come for the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup every time. It's a gotta have for me and so is the  car bombs, but tonight I'm addicted to the body bomb. It's lighter in taste. It's perfect!  It's not as rich as the orig. car bomb. Thanks Jesse for the recommendation.

This place is awesome. I feel like I'm going on a date w/ my hubby every time. You get to eat and have a few drinking while ur watching ur movie. Best part is that you buzz for your server when you need a refill or anything else that you might need. I Love how they have couple seats. Food is yummy and that prices are pretty much the same as if your going to just have popcorn or nachos at a regular movie theater. So why not go here and just have an actual full meal and service!.  It's not as packed as going to a regular theater. idk why, but that's even better i guess. Everyone should go here. I think it's an awesome experience.

My new favorite pizza joint. They have such a great menu to choose from. The thin crust is super yummy. There is nothing on their menu that my family n I don't like. Their food is really I die for.

I think that everyone hates going to see the dentist. I know I always have since I was a kid, but when I had came here for the first time my thoughts of seeing the dentist has changed. Dr. Allen is awesome possum. I felt no pain whatsoever and the best part i was out in an hour. The girls in office are super nice n friendly. I just found my regular family dental.

This is my fav Korean spot in town. They're closed on Mondays so it's hard to get a chance to stop in. My favorite is their hot stone bibimbap soon tofu combo. It's nicely air conditioned with plenty of tables. It seats big parties which is great cus we have family that always comes into town.

Thought i would try this place out and im glad that i did. I loved the decor, the cleanliness of this place was almost spotless. It was almost like walking into some movie because it was just so nicely thought out. Everyone there was nice. I had asked my therapist to focus on my neck n shoulders n he did an awesome job. I have been to their other locations and i've always left as a Happy customer. Their prices are reasonable so I look forward to my next day of pampering.

I love coming in to get me nails done here. I tell Huey what I need done (full set, fill, repair) he gets the job done perfectly. I leave it up to him on the rest ( color /design ). The prices are reasonable n not overly price like other places. So if ur looking into getting ur nails all pretty this is where u want to go. Everyone is friendly there. I also loved that fact they care about their customers. I sit down n they ask if I'd like some water. I'm always leaving this place satisfied.
