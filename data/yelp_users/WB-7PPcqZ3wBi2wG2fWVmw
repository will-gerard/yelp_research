I received this as a gift from my husband who purchased from groupon.  Great idea and price however my attendee smelled like cigarettes, the floor was dirty and they gave me a robe that was torn and shredded at the sleeves.  The best part was my masage (note sarcasm).  The gentlemen who gave me the massage had my body contorted in different positions, actually used a chopping method on my back... is he even certified?  Most unrelaxing massage I've ever received.  The best part was when I turned on the lights to dress I could not believe the filthy massage bed I had layed upon, who knows when the sheets were washed.  I went home and showered, felt filthy and the products they use stink.  Don't go there!!!!!

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME.  I've been going to Vonn since I moved to AZ almost 3 years ago, andI made the transition with her from Floyd's when she struck out on her own.  Always very professionla, coutreous, andup to date on the newest products and cuts.  I would recommend her to anyone.  Love the text reminders and monthll newsletters!

I used a Groupon for a facial and was pleasantly surprised.  My skin looks great, the products smelled wonderful.  Attendant was so helpful and friendly.  I would highly recommend and use again.  I also got my eyebrows threaded, different sensation but my eyebrows have never looked better and no stray hairs or redness. I'm sold.
