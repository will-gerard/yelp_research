I have to say I enjoyed the food, we both had steak. The thing was, it was literally the WORST dining experience i've ever had. First of all we had a reservation and waited for a table when it wasn't busy. Then we got seated and had to ask for a wine list after sitting for 5 minutes. Then we ordered sparkling water (which i don't really care about but it was my fiance's birthday!) and they brought us tap water. We ordered a nice bottle of wine but had to flag our server down to order, then to get bread, then to get our plates cleared, and then for the bill...and we were patiently waiting the whole time (i don't want my food spit in) Then the couple next to us decided to go through a divorce...I mean it. They were screaming at each other and the husband decided to get up and leave, he was totally piss drunk and stumbling. Then he came back only to greet the friends they were meeting and pretend they were okay. But the entire time they were screaming and yelling and the waiters at the station right behind them didn't say a word to them about their profanity, their volume or anything while we were spending over $100 and trying to have a romantic dinner. Totally ridiculous service...but the food was good. Better places to go.

There was a lot of sinning going on all over the bachlorette weekend we attended, but the classy Bellagio really helped us do it right. Chihuly art in the Lobby, a plethora of good restaurants, one of the nicests spas I've been to, many pools to choose from, the decadent fountains which we could see from our room (which you can set to music by finding the hotel's station on the tv), and some awesome restaurant options.   I always thought staying here meant paying crazy high prices, but we paid a standard room rate for vegas and got a very nice room. The rooms were large, room service and housekeeping were friendly (and generous with the chocolates), and there was lots of room for girls to get ready. I am for sure coming back.   After the craziness we encountered in our wild weekend, it was so great having a clean, elegant place to return to.

One of the other fabulous bridesmaids in my friend's wedding selected this spot for our pre-going-out girl's dinner. It was a huge hit. I think it ended up being a very affordable $100 or so a person for 7 girls.   We got a little sloppy toward the end but I do recall the following amazing dishes: Cheese fondue, a tasty salad with goat cheese, truffle mac and cheese. These were smaller apps we all shared. Everyone also really liked the cheeseburger sliders tho I didn't try those because I was fixated on fondue and mac and cheese two of my most favorite things. For the main course many of us opted to try the chicken and dumplings and the short ribs. They were both fabulous.   I highly recommend Nobhill Tavern for either a group outing or dining with a smaller party. It's a great value and everything was delicious! It's nice to find an affordable yet still high quality Michael Minna restaurant!

We had a great meal here but it definitely wasn't the 5-star experience I've come to expect of Michael Mina establishments.  Maybe it was because we waited so long WITH a reservation and after coming back within 20 minutes, as they suggested, we waited about 10 more. Or the fact that we were seated right next to the entrance which didn't make for a romantic setting (more like mall dining despite the glass barrier). Or that we told a number of people it was our anniversary and no one acknowledged it despite all the other restaurants we visited during the anniversary trip doing so). Not sure...but our server was friendly, the recommended wine was tasty and the food was good so 4 stars you get.  Duck Fat Fries trio=awesome. We adored the Tuna and Hamachi Poppers Was shockingly not a fan of the duck spring rolls which were too gamey Mac and Cheese = most awesome Scallops were tasty but a little underdone for my tastes. Husband like the steak but didn't find it super memorable.  All in all if you're in Vegas and want MM, I'd suggest Nob Hill Tavern instead.

I would come back here in a heartbeat! I didn't have any treatments done but my bride-to-be friend and I purchased a day pass to enjoy an afternoon of luxury. After some bananas and a V8 we worked out in their huge gym. It was almost empty, very clean and had plenty of machines with TVs, mini water bottles, and headsets provided. Next came relaxing in the steam room, consuming much water and free juices, varying temperature hot tubs, the sauna and getting ready for the pool in a locker room that had everything you'd ever need!  What an awesome way to spend the day, especially in preparation for a crazy weekend...

Food wise I would give this place 5 stars, but the manager on duty knocks it down for us. We were a large group of 20 meeting up for a joint bachelor/ette dinner after a weekend of solo partying. The girls were staying in the bellagio but the guys were not so of course there were a few people who were late (within 10 minutes) arrivals. The manager was overly concerned with these people not being present even though we had a prix fixe menu already outlaid, and orders at the ready. Eventually he let us sit but as people filed in he scowled as us disapprovingly the entire time.  This was very strange since it was early, they had been nothing by nice in making the arragements over the phone and via email, and the place was totally not full. Also, we were all dressed up trying to show each other that we hadn't partied as hard as we could the night prior! Dressed to the nines and very mellow as we dined and tried to eliminate the pain we felt from the night before, we were far from rowdy but this manager acted like we were wild kids who needed to be rushed along.  The wait staff was actually professional and friendly and everyone was well taken care of. We had three awesome options for entrees and the accompaniments were equally delicious. My shortribs were very tasty tho a little on the fatty side (tricky when you're eating with chopsticks). A bunch of people ordered extra food like sushi (strawberry roll!) and sashimi and it was fresh and flavorful. They had a nice selection of tequilas and girly drinks like the cucumber one I was enjoying. Our shared dessert plate was a hit!  I would come back if that manager were off duty for sure!

Loved this adorable little restaurant for Sunday brunch.  Nice patio outside and I'm pretty sure they had live music but it was in full sun and already crowded when we arrived about 11am. We opted for a table inside right by the open front windows (almost like being outside without the sunburn). I had the red velvet pancakes with mascarpone cr√®me, gran marnier syrup & applewood smoked bacon. Pretty tasty but definitely rich. I'd probably have something a little lighter next time.  My husband had chilaquiles, which he actually makes quite well. He enjoyed them but really wanted them spicier and they were lacking for any kind of Mexican hot sauce (tabasco wasn't really what we had in mind).  Yummy cocktails and delicious ice teas. Pretty friendly service too. Bonus points for gluten-free and other restricted diet options!

mmmm straight of the plane and off to daily dose before a baseball game. Husband had the breakfast nachos which were super tasty. I had a turkey sausage eggs benedict. I love any time I get to enjoy turkey sausage so I was already happy seeing this on the menu but lucky me, it also tasted good. Definitely want to go back to try some of the really unhealthy delicious things friends recommended (banana bread french toast).  They don't take reservations for brunch but it was about a 20 minute wait even though there were TONS of people waiting so not bad at all.

After beer and ballpark food at Spring Training it was nice to enjoy an elegant brunch here at Arcadia Farms. It definitely feels like a little french cottage and the highly coveted patio seating is perfect for a ladies who lunch type event. I enjoyed the strawberry salad and the scones were delicious. Service was a bit on the slow side, but that may just be the vibe of the place.   As an SF food snob, I really enjoy a place that cares so much about the quality of their produce and being able to enjoy local and organic ingredients in my meal (I know, you're rolling your eyes, I've accepted it).  Bonus points for giving a discount if you show your Giants game ticket! :)  Given the lovely patio and experience, I will take off no stars for the fact that a very rude bird pooped on my husband.

I'm going to echo the sentiment of another reviewer and say awesome atmosphere and experience, and just so-so food. This is the kind of place you're better off sticking with a burger. I had the Kahlua pork entree which wasn't bad and I LOVED that I was able to get a sampler of many of the local beers. Really dug the White Chocolate from Sonoran brewery.  We had great service and a lovely table outside in the sun surrounded by dogs and Giants Fans for Spring Training. Bonus points for having freshly baked dog biscuits. The mutt woulda really loved it, but she refuses to fly coach out to Arizona.  Would definitely want to check out their Sunday backyard BBQ next time I'm in the area.
