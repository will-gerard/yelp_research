They replaced the clutch in my Nissan Frontier about a year ago. After comparing prices for the job, the price was reasonable and service was fast, professional and courteous. They needed to make a small adjustment in the clutch pedal or something, and they fixed it immediately and apologized.

Always nice, fast and professional. Go here so you don't have to worry about the B.S. you might put up with at other places.

Quality, service, presentation...all 10/10.  After an unfortunate event in the family, I wanted to have flowers delivered promptly. They had to be of excellent quality and presentation. Value was also important to me. I called and explained the circumstances to the manager, Caroline, along with my preferences and budget. She filled out the gift with wonderful suggestions. The bouquet of flowers, chocolates and a note was perfect, and my mother loved it.   Oh yeah...they're speedy! I ordered over the phone and the flowers were delivered about an hour later to a location about eight miles from the shop. Thanks to Caroline, who created the bouquet and to Bill, who delivered for the wonderful product. Thanks for helping to make a terrible situation better.  I'm so glad to see such a great business in East Mesa.

The place is clean and bright and the staff is friendly and professional. I like the clear billing statements and estimates. The other reviews cover it all. I have had a few questions with billing my insurance company, and they have cleared it up every time. I love the relaxed feel of the place so much that it makes me look forward to going to the dentist.  Expect them to offer more cosmetic-type services such as whitening because this is where all dentists make money, but it's not a problem.  I LOVE that they play whatever kind of music they want. I'm sure they would let you plug in your iPod to the stereo system if you were ever so inclined.

These reviews are great, so mine is short.  The best coffee in Phoenix. Very good pastries and other food. The wine bar people get annoying when I'm having a study night. It gets too busy sometimes, which is a mixed blessing. Seating is either very comfortable or it hurts my back. Ambience is nearly perfect, except for the wine bar people. The music is very good. If it's too busy, I'll go to Lola or Copper Star. You can easily spend $10 on a latte and pastry, so it's a bit expensive.

I've been going to this location for two years, and other locations for ten years. I have price matched from both Sears and Costco for two different sets of tires, and they're happy to match. I always make appointments for tire rotations, and I'm usually in and out in 30 minutes. The employees are friendly, professional and fast.  It's best to go when it's not busiest; busy times are Fridays and Saturdays. I wish they had wifi, but that's not a reason to take a star away. Tip: if you can, just wait until they have a promotion because you can frequently get $50-$100 off a set of four tires.

All of the good things a great restaurant should have--excellent, unique food, friendly staff, great bar. Cozy, intimate and relaxing. It's the perfect to place to have the first of 100th date, catch-up with an old friend, or just to enjoy some of the best food in Phoenix. That being said, the food is very reasonably priced as are the drinks given the quality of each.

They have always done a great job whether I get the mini-detail or a cheapie wash. Definitely recommend. Price is a bit high if all you want is your carpet and seats shampooed.

I don't feel like these other reviews are real. In any case, here is mine:  I've been meaning to post this review for almost a year now.  I took my vehicle in to replace the bumper and fender. They did a good job with painting the new parts and installation was mostly okay, staff was friendly, but that's where it ends:  1. The paint was slightly smeared on a crease that separates the unpainted bumper from the painted section. It just looks sloppy. When I asked them about this, they shrugged. 2. They left some plastic wrap material that prevented overspray in the passenger front door. 3. They did not reconnect parts of the door panel. 4. The fender did not align with the bumper properly; they said they could do nothing about it and that I would have to take the fender back to the Nissan dealership.  I decided to pay for these repairs out of pocket, so there was no insurance company with whom to complain. I wish I had just made a claim on my own insurance to have peace of mind. I've found Yelp reviews to be generally accurate, this is why question the other reviews. I don't understand how my experience can be so different from the other reviewers'.

Deceptive contracts. When you ask the sales people to clarify terms in the contract, they will make up lies. It's a shame that such a nice facility (initially) has gone downhill so fast.  1. I had to stop doing cardio there because they would dust, vacuum, and use a strong cleaner right next to me while on the treadmills. I have asthma and it made me have an asthma attack. This happened several times; see other review.  2. Locker room is disgusting and dirty, especially on weekends. Water will puddle for days in the shower, along with wet towels, razors, and paper towels. Showers frequently broken.  3. They do not stay open late enough (8pm) on weekends.  4. They do not have enough bars so the all benches and the squat rack can be used at the same time. It's annoying when it gets busy.  5. Parking is a disaster. The parking company likes to randomly open and not post the hours they are open. Want to grab food after a workout? Tough luck; your validation is good for only two hours, and it can't be validated by a restaurant and Gold's Gym. I thought CityScape wanted people to spend money there.  6. Not once have I seen staff properly stack the weights. Trainers leave weights and other equipment everywhere.  7. Creepy guys will be sitting in the chairs in the locker room watching people change for hours.  8. Basically no one uses the overnight, for-charge lockers, and there aren't nearly enough regular lockers. Such a waste of space.  I could go on and on. In central Phoenix, I would recommend other gyms ahead of this one, including Tangible, YouFit, and even LA Fitness on 20th St during non-peak hours. Don't waste your time and money. Staff is nice, and the gym looks neat, but it's a terrible place to sign a contact to use.

You know, I really wish Gold's Gym staff would stop harassing me with messages here...read my review for why I left. I will never, ever go to a Gold's Gym again.

I lived here for two years and I recently moved out. Everything was pretty good; the only issue is residents and transients being loud with partying and fighting on occassion. However, it's nothing I wouldn't expect from an apartment complex of this size, and management always addressed those and other issues promptly. It's clean, things are fixed quickly, the grounds are nice as are the apartments themselves. If you're looking for nice, albeit slightly small apartments, these are a good choice.

I love Jobot...but...the girls really need to put their hair in nets. Pulling three long hairs off of my plate is kinda gross.  That's all. Everything else is good. Portions, food, friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere.

Great food, bar, service, prices, atmosphere. Waiters will bring over ice cream from next door. One time, they gave us cookies that they haven't sold for the day. The food is great comfort food. The macaroni and cheese or ruben sandwiches are both amazing with a delicious draft beer.  It's a great date spot because of the slight conversational noise (but it's not annoyingly loud) and the 80s and 90s music they play is always interesting to listen to.  I'll come back again and again.

7/31 update:  I've been pretty patient with the staff here, but It's been almost ten days since I submitted a maintenance request, and nothing has been done. Not only that, I asked for these things to be fixed when I moved in *and* these things should have been fixed before I even moved in.  As I have before, I'll update if and when progress has been made. It's frustrating living in a place where staff is so unresponsive--the hallway doors are broken, I can hear them slam in my apartment, the hallways are dirty with bags of trash, my apartment still has many things that should have been fixed before I moved in. The air conditioner barely works. I could ramble even more.  I'm tired of nagging staff to get things done over and over again. While Candace has been helpful in getting many of the initial problems fixed, there are still problems to resolve. As before, I'll update if and when things improve. I certainly hope they will.

I'm not one for soy, vegan or vegetarian food, but my taste buds and blood sugar level were both happy after a chocolate donut and mocha latte.

I paid almost 8 dollars for a mocha latte and a bagel and cream cheese. The coffee was good but not disappointing; the bagel was a Costco bagel. I used to be a regular when it was Lola's, and then Citizen before management changed. It's just not worth the price when there are other places to go that are also barely adequate but cheaper.  The wifi didn't work using both my phone and laptop. I came here to do homework. Thankfully, I jailbroke my phone so I can tether my phone to my laptop to get an internet connection.  The chairs are cheap and uncomfortable.  Maybe I'm in a grumpy mood. Whatever. I'll give it another try in a few months.  If I want to pay $8 for a pastry and coffee, I'll go to Lux, where the internet also doesn't work, but at least they'll have fresh pastries and excellent coffee.  And the Central Phoenix coffee shops used to be so great...

I was here last Saturday to see to Mark Farina, who they put on from midnight to 4 AM. The door staff was friendly, which is what I expect out of a Downtown Phoenix bar or club, not a Scottsdale one. The crowd was mixed, and everyone looked like they were having a good time.  As I arrived,  a local DJ was playing, and for the life of me I can't remember his name, but he had people dancing when the place wasn't crowded yet. Definitely a crowd pleaser. The audio system was pretty good, but echoes were noticeable on the south end of the room, and the sound was a bit tinny. I'm not an audio engineer, but I think it would sound better by adding speakers on the south end of the room and turning the sound down a bit as to reduce the slightly tinny, blaring sound. Don't get me wrong--the sound is pretty good--but there is room for improvement in the next year or two. Mark Farina was excellent, as expected, and had nearly everyone in the jam-packed place dancing.  The bar staff was friendly, drinks were reasonably-priced, but as the place got very busy, service was a little too slow. But it's nothing unexpected and I was satisfied with the bar and the staff.  This place is actually perfect for me. I tend to like the bars, clubs and restaurants of Central and Downtown Phoenix, and there really is a need for an electronic music club in Downtown Phoenix. It looks like the owners of Bar Smith are filling this need by opening Monarch Theater. I really hope it's successful. The place does need a bit of work--a few things looked still under construction--but it's obvious that they are making continuous improvements. It's definitely worth checking out.

What a pleasant surprise! My group of friends had the most friendly, prompt waitress in the history of the world. And the pizza was perfect.  GO THERE ON A MONDAY!  You can get either 2 pizzas + 1 pitcher of beer (or something like that) or one pizza and a bottle of wine for $20. And the waitress was like, "Get the most expensive wine for the best deal." So I did.  Just go. It's not too loud, not too quiet. On a steamy evening July it was a little warm inside (that's what she...never mind.). But who cares.  I'm going to have to go back and back to try the rest of the menu. Oh, and I got the margherita pizza. Everything about it was perfect. I can taste the delish dough in my watering mouth right now.  Oh, there's a drive-through!

It's ironic that the tow truck is parked in the fire lane.  No visitor spots. 30 empty spots. Tow truck waiting for the visitors to park in an empty, non-visitor spot.
