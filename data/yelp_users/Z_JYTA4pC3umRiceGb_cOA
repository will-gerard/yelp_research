I was treated very rude by the owners and will tell anyone I cross paths with not to patron this establishment.  They think they can treat customers rudely without getting a reputation.  I watched them kick out a mother and her children because she had a barking dog in her Bentley outside.   O.K. I am that mother. The nerve!

Met some friends here for dinner. Had already had the pleasure of dinning here several times before but this time got the seafood tower and was really impressed with the fresh, sweet and ice cold sea treasures adorning this tower.   I was so full that I couldn't fathom ordering an entree.  But there is always room for dessert.  Great service as you would expect.  Bar is quite the bore with the "do you see me?  I'm one of the cool people, I have arrived"  bullshit attitude.  Who you kidding?   Watch me leaving.

went there for lunch and had great service and good chelsea salad and so so minestrone soup.  garlic knots baked to perfection with tons of flavor and a nice crisp on the bottom.  so, i bragged it up to my family and took eight of us there for dinner on friday night!  mistake number 1 !  15 minutes for drink order,  ordered the same thing i had for lunch the day before and while the salad was good the soup was warm and garlic bread was a dough ball with no garlic slurry or crisp bottom.  complained to manager and she was full of excuses of the oven not being reliable!  slice of pizza was doughy!  antipasto salad had no toppings on it!  really?  11 people supposedly working with 8 customers and could never get their attention!  what an embarrassment!  new york would evict this pretender!  someone call the  real nypd and arrest them!
