If I coukd give them less stars I would. Not only was the staff not not very friendly or Moving with urgency,  it took forever for them to greet us after being sat. 3 separate people came to us after we had to request service, one girl claimed to be our waitress then never came back. Another gentleman saved the day or else we would have just walked out. We wanted to have the tip given to the guy thst actually served us instead of our "waitress", who could have been a busser. Never again will step foot in this building and really makes me want to avoid native all together. Hopefully they get their act together or they won't be in business much longer since they don't want to earn our money.

My favorite vape shop in town.I have been going here for quite awhile now and I buy all my stuff from here. The owner is super friendly, has lots of knowledge and isn't afraid to tell you what is good or not. Does not try to hassle you at all into buying things you don't want or cannot afford, he is there to truly help the customer. Has some of the best juice lines in town and great prices. Always is down to help you rebuild your coils and let you hang out and try his samples!
