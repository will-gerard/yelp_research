This is the best dental office I have ever been to. I've not been a big fan of going to the dentist, but I really enjoy going to see everyone at place! So nice and friendly!

I can't thank Cynthia enough for being so helpful with the purchase of my new home.  I can say she goes above and beyond!    I decided to build a home and Cynthia was with me every step of the way.  She made sure I got my home built for the best price possible.  I will definitely refer Cynthia to all my friends and family. Michelle Connor

I tried this place for  the first time last Tuesday night with my girlfriend. One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Justin the bartender made us the most incredible drinks,..he is a master at his craft. The food we had was absolutely amazing!! I will be back.

Just ate at the perch  for the first time . My husband had a burger which was good I had the shrimp citrus salad and it was not very good. The service was very slow I'll give this place one more chance maybe.

I tried this place for the first time yesterday for lunch I was really excited about the menu but the service was not good at all. I ordered a gluten-free burger with gluten free fries, when the order arrived it wasn't even what I ordered. So they said they would redo my order and send a manager out to talk to me I waited 15 more minutes no one came out to talk to me finally got my burger & fries. Burger was okay fries were luke warm.
