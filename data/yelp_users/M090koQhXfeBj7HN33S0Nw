My wife and I use Yelp often and the four star reviews never let us down. We were excited to try this new Italian place which had four stars, but we left hungry and disappointed. The bread was nothing special. The water tasted terrible. Portion size was ridiculously small. Nothing about this restaurant supports its high prices. My wife wants to substitute veggies for pasta and they charged $5 dollars to accommodate the request. The veggies were saturated in oil and over cooked. Another thing that I wish I checked in the beginning of the meal was the bathroom. Had I checked before I would had left and not subjected ourselves to this poor experience. Dust and trash everywhere and the stench was awful. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. My wife and I dine out often and know our stuff. This place was a huge letdown.

This place was awesome. Friendly. One thing is your sandwich will take about 15 minutes plus to get. Overall solid.

I'm almost afraid to write this review in fear that too many people will go to this amazing restaurant. However, I am going to take one for the foodie team. This place is tucked away in a strip mall and if you don't look hard enough you'll miss it. My first trip to Marco's we were greeted and sat right away. We ordered the sizzling olive oil... it was served from a skillet table-side. GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLY! AMAZING! Frutti de mar was next. The portion size was HUGE and the seafood was unbeatably fresh. You cannot go wrong when you have the owner in the kitchen. Other than the location, I can think of nothing but great things about this restaurant. My wife and I recently went to Italy for vacation and it turns out you don't need to travel across the world for authentic cuisine. Do your belly a favor and go to Marco. He will treat you right. Also, the prices are extremely fair so you can have a nice dinner and not break the bank.

Wow. My wife and I are diehard foodies. We now wish everyday was an Eddie V's day. This place was awesome. It exceeded every expectation. We used to go to Ocean Club weekly but we have converted to Eddie V's. they don't pack you in like sardines as OC does. Service is better. Food is as good if not better. The bar is unbelievably comfortable and the live music is some of the best I've heard. Do yourself a favor and drop OC and come over to Eddie. The Banana Foster is a gift from the food gods.

Barrio Queen was a huge disappointment. DO NOT get the tacos. They were so small the table laughed when they brought it - we thought it was a joke, looked smaller than an appetizer. They had numerous items on the menu that were not available and the waiter was pretty rude. With all the good restaurants in the area, dont waste your time or money at Barrio Queen.

Love, Love, Love this place! Its the day after my dinner at Rehab and Im still thinking about it...maybe I am addicted, cant wait for my next fix! The service was on point, our waitress had lots of recommendations and suggestions on what to order. The inside was decorated with a really fun vibe. The food was bomb! I substituted my burger for turkey burger and it was still awesome. My favorite part was all the dipping sauces the waitress brought over, around six to choose from. I cant wait to go back and recommend this place with 5 stars!

I walked out on Valentines Day with my wife. This was a Horrible experience in all aspects, with nothing redeeming on any level.   Be advised! Do not go to this restaurant! Get a frozen dinner and you'll be more satisfied.   I guess I will start at the beginning. I made reservations over a month ago. I was expecting something more... way more than what I experienced tonight. We were treated with less customer service than a fast food restaurant.  We walked in at our reservation time. The hostess seemed very confused. They were young but without any customer service training. We would have been better trying to seat ourselves. They did not know if our table was ready. Then they tried to seat us in the two worst tables in the house. We were forced to not sit in the dinning room, but in the packed bar. Soon after were served water and bread.  Our waitress seemed attentive (later to find out she also was awful). We tried to order drinks but or waitress came back 3 times to tell us they were out of the selections we desired. The waitress used some weak excuse that they did not receive their shipments or someone decided to not order it. At this point we should have gotten up and left. However, we decide against our better judgment to stay. My wife ordered a Cabernet and she was then served a glass of white wine. I then ordered a Martini, which had so much vermouth that it was undrinkable. Still, for some reason we ordered appetizers.        We had the Tuna and the famous Cuttlefish Calamari. The Tuna was bland and had no seasoning. The Cuttlefish was also bland (big surprise) and the provided dipping sauce was not to my liking. I ask the waitress for a cocktail sauce which never came. After our first bite of this less than mediocre cuisine she was pushing the main course. It was clear that this was not a dinning experience. I never received the accouterments I requested. I was now livid. Nothing we ordered was available. Service was terrible. Food was awful. Nothing about this restaurant was even decent. I requested the check, which found its way to our table scary fast. Our waitress made no attempt to try to rectify this situation.       Now, one would think this would have been enough. However I must be a glutton for punishment. I decided to talk to management. Wrong choice! I spoke to the "manager" and was insulted again. The manager informed me that it was a new restaurant and that it was obvious that someone decided to "pick on us". The manager gave us a half-ass apology, and then again emphasized that it was a "new restaurant and that someone picked on us". WTF! Picked on us?!? We were out of there with $60 down the sewer (I use that verbiage purposely)! The food was swill and overpriced swill. Cuttlefish is an embarrassment to even subpar restaurants.   I have never been more insulted. I have never had a worse experience. I will never go back. They almost ruined our Valentines Day. However, we made the right choice and went to a Sam Fox restaurant where we were taken care of. So, thank you to Sam Fox!  Cuttlefish belongs on Restaurant Nightmares Hall of Fame with Amy's Baking Company! Terrible, awful, crap in all respects!
