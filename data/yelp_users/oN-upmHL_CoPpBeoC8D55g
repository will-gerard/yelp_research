This place is ALWAYS GOOD! Haven't had a pasty I've been disappointed with so far! My favorite is the chicken portobello ! Their oven chips and meatballs for appetizers are great as well! The pastys and made and baked fresh, so it can take a little time to get your food, but it is so worth the wait! Great prices on alcohol! And their desserts are SO good!! My fave is the chocolate bread pudding! A MUST everytime we good!      The only con is the staff/service ! Sometimes we get great servers that are very attentive and keep our drinks filled.. Other times it takes forever to see our server and to get the bill to pay!

This place is probably the best dim sum I've had in Arizona...... Nowhere near Cali standards..but when the husband and I need a dim sum fix, this is the place we go to! Haven't tried their dinner... So can not speak about that!

This is my fiancé and I's favorite pho/Vietnamese spot in Arizona! One of the only places we'll go! Their pho, bun rieu, goi cuon, are my fav's! Whether I eat in or take it go.. Always amazing!!  The owners are the sweetest friendliest people ever! Always helpful and when we bring new people in they explain it very well! Yes I've seen some people comment it is pricier than other restaurants in the valley... But u get what u pay for!

No complaints about the drinks every drink I've ordered from here has been good, my complaint is about the wait. Yes it does get the AM rush 6-730, but so do other locations. One morning I decided to go inside to order my drink thinking it would be faster versus the extremely long drive thru line.... i was WRONG... I went in about 640 ordered my drink, a shaken green tea lemonade.. and I did not get my drink until 657.. which is RIDICULOUS for a TEA.... I think I counted about 7-8 people who ordered coffess.. fraps, macchiatos, etc AFTER me.. and go their drinks BEFORE me... I noticed the barista working made ALL The coffee drinks first and then took a minute to make my tea... which literally took LESS than a minute. to pour make and give to me.. i will NOT be going back to this starbucks again, maybe during a day.... but NEVER in the morning because I was late for work when i got there in plenty of time!

Love the atmosphere in this place! The patio w/ the fireplace is sooo cute!   The food.... So good!!! I got the margherita pizza & the fiancé got the duck club!  I had no complaints about my pizza, so good! Whenever we try a new pizza place we always go for the margherita or simplest pizza... Because if that's amazing everything else should be too!   My fiancé's duck club was good as well... The fries.. Amazing!! The only complaint my fiancé had about his club was the bacon overpowered his duck..... Now he is very picky about his duck... Lol. But still good! We also got the free dessert with out yelp check in and it the banana dessert by recommendation from our waitress... Good as well!

would not recommend. Our visit started off bad. The "hostess" or what we thought was the hostess started off extremely rude when she sat us down.. We were meeting 2 other people there and my husband and I beat them there so we got a table and sat down first. When our friends arrived, the "hostess" turned out to be our waitress as well, just looked at our table and finally 5 minutes later came to take our order for drinks. 5 minutes later we received our water. 15 minutes later she walked by, and said she would be right back to take our order. In the next 10 minutes she went to another table to take their order and ran food to 2 other tables. Then she came back to us, and in a rude voice asked to take our order for dinner, very impatiently. The whole night she did not have a smile on her face, very impatient and rushed. And the restaurant was not even busy!! There was maybe 5 tables that had customers. Onto the food, I just ordered an appetizer 7 layer dip, as we had eaten earlier and was still full, my dip was bland. I have had better 7 layer dip from a grocery store. My fiancé ordered 4 street tacos (btw you can not mix and match different kinds of meat, you HAVE to get 2 of the same kind) he said they were bland and nothing special. Overall, horrible experience, bad food, not authentic Mexican, will not return

I love this place!! The food is amazing and so are their drinks!! The atmosphere is cool for a casual meet up with friends or a date night! I got the Windsor burger and it was amazing! I will definitely be back! Our waiter was amazing and the appetizers & food came out super fast despite it being a very busy night!

This place has delicious ice cream!! Have been here twice, once around lunch/early dinner time and the second late in the evening after dinner about 9pm'ish? Not very busy early in the evening, long lines at night on the weekend, but worth it!  LOVE LOVE LOVE the mint & the Vietnamese coffee!! Also the first time i went there they had a Stout flavor.. but sadly was not there the second time I went! Price is fair and their selection of cones is good as well!  Will be back again to try other flavors and milkshakes, etc!

Went with a group of people... Drove by this place so many times and finally decided to try it! We decided to do the teppanyaki. My fiancé and i ordered the teppanyaki dinner for 2 and we were able to choose 4 different types of meat.. We choose the sirloin, shrimp, calamari, & swordfish... Our food was amazing! The sirloin calamari & swordfish was out favs!! It was $52 for both of us which isn't too bad.. We expected to pay more for the teppanyaki.... Definitely better than Benihana!! Will probably come back!

Tried this place the other night because we didn't want to go far & it has good ratings.  Got there about 920pm...  1) Ordered drinks & appetizers right away... Ordered the pork belly & scallops.. Both were NOT good! Pork belly was not buttery soft like it should be.... And the scallops came back cold & undercooked.   2) Dinner.. I ordered the burger while my fiancé ordered the steak and fries... I asked for my burger medium.. It came out well done.. Overall it was an ok burger.. Nothing special  My fiancé's steak..... He ordered it rAre... It pretty much came back not cooked.. Just grill marks on the outside.. But inside not cooked.... There IS a difference between rare & not cooked..   Overall will not be going back ever again... Not sure if it was because we came in later? They closed at 10pm.. But we ordered right away.. And when we left there (few minutes before 10) there was about 5 people still at the bar. It shouldn't matter what time time we go in... Food quality should be good regardless .. Also overpriced.. Charging scottsdale upscale restaurant prices for something that's not worth it!

Don't get the high review ratings. Bad service. Super slow to take our order. Then we get our pho, which was warm, not hot, and bland, with maybe 10 noodles in it?! And we had also ordered an order of spring rolls .... Which we did not get before our meal arrived... And I saw a table who sat down 10min after us get their order of spring rolls. Thought I'd wait to see if they'd bring it out. Finished our meal and still no spring rolls. After we received our food, never had another server come to our table. No do you need anymore water ? Or how's your food?   Will not be back again. My husband and I both left still hungry and he drove right across parking lot into whataburgers drive thru.

I've been here a few times to try different smoothies & they were all amazing.. Except one I was not a fan of but can't for the life of me remember which one! The service was good and my drink came out fast, which is a plus! Everything is so fresh ! I really want to try their acai bowls next! They look amazing! The drinks are pretty pricy tho... So it's a nice treat when I'm feeling too lazy to make my own!    The orange crush & pink flamingo are my favs!!

Finally another crawfish place in AZ! I've had boiling crab from Cali and angry crab in AZ so I was excited to try this place because I never had the chance to while in Vegas! It has pros and cons Pros: the hot n juicy sauce is so good! The shrimp and black mussels are good as well! Only had a few mussels that were not opened which was good! Cons: service - sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not. Having different servers help can be good and bad.. Nice for extra help when u don't see your waiter, but sometimes it's a nightmare to and takes forever to get the bill and pay.  Also location, it's nice it's in Tempe, but the locations is horrible and the space is SMALL . Parking is a nightmare as well.   Overall I will go back again because it's all we have in Az.. But I will not go on a weekend or night! Only for lunch when it is not as busy and parking is a little easier..

This place was horrible! Environment inside = wayyyyyy too dark! Went about 11am, going from the bright outside to super dark inside it took like 5 minutes for my eyes to full adjust to be able to see anything! Ordered our food... 2 spring roll appetizers and 2 bowls of pho, papaya salad, and lemongrass chicken. In a normal Vietnamese restaurant your spring roll is out in about 5-10min max from ordering... Then your pho follows shortly after.... Not this place!! 20min later ONE spring roll, the nem nuong came out.... Highly disappointed.... Would not have known it was nem nuong if I didn't order it.... Another 25min later our pho comes out along with the other 2 dishes .... Pho was bland and flavorless.  It should NOT take 40-45min to get pho ..... When there was only 3 other tables in the restaurant..... PLUS  we didn't even get the other spring roll we ordered!!! Completely disappointed.... Went to the location when it used to be next to the 202.... Figured we'd tried it one more time.... Will never go back.. There are much better Vietnamese restaurant around.

went in late on Saturday night, about 1230am, for just a small bite to kill time, only had an appetizer, sushi rolls, and soju. But the two we had were really good!! We took my cousin from Korea there, and she liked the food as well! They were not busy at a that time so we had no issues with service! The servers were attentive and helpful! We were there til 2am when they closed, and the servers did not try to rush us out! Will definitely be back again to try out entrees!

Was sooooooo excited when I heard they were finally opening a poke place in Arizona! First tried it a few months back in Cali where it's super popular now.  Finally had the chance to try it w/ the hubby.  He ordered he regular bowl. I ordered be half salad half white rice. It's set up like a chipotle, you choose your rice/salad, then your meat, your sauce, and finally your toppings.   I ordered a green tea and he ordered the Thai tea.   When we sat down to eat it.... We weren't impressed just by how it looked.. But sometimes looks are deceiving... So we started to dig in to see how it was.. Still... Not impressed ... The meat tasted fresh.. But the sauce lacked flavor.... We had to add soy sauce to make it taste a little better ....  Onto the drinks.  The Thai tea tasted watered down .... As did my iced green tea .... Which was not green... More of a muddy water color which was very unappetizing .... All in all ... We felt cheated .. Overpriced and not satisfying. ... Not sure if I'll be back again ... Not the same experience I had in Cali
