Nice inside.  My daughter and I thought it felt like a old diner turned asian.  Oldies playing on the radio, nice clean tables and booths.  The food was great, tasted fresh and they had a simple menu.   When I'm back in the area I will stop there again.

The plastic in my pulled pork, overly dry hamburger for my daughter. The service was just nothing to write anything nice about.  I would suggest in the future if you like your food and wait staff sub par.  Too much to ask?   I suggest if you serve plastic in the food maybe the manager could apologize, maybe even take that off the bill.  I'm still wondering where plastic would come from?

I stopped here because of all the great reviews I read.    I looked at best buy, amazon, etc and never got the answers I was looking for.     After walking in all my questions where answered, I got a quote on the pioneer I wanted, and my timing was great because they just finished a car early and got my truck in right away.    Needless to say I drive away in 45 mins with my new stereo in my dash and I couldn't be happier.   Price, service, and friendliness are 5 stars!!  Coming back to get some work done on my daughters car.
