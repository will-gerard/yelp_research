Great food try the food hands down the best Mexican food I've had since I've been in Arizona other than the giant Cock roach crawling up the wall . So I whispered quietly to the host because I didn't want to make a scene or interfere with the other guests. When i mention it to the hostess he actually got an attitude with me. He didn't comp us at all with free drink or anything I would never go there again !

Very nice atmosphere service was fast and courteous but Far from I had expected. I had lots of Middle Eastern food in the valley but I never had a chicken shawarma sandwich with lettuce on. Overall the garlic sauce was good and the meat was marinated gooood.  Like they say you get what you pay for. The $5 choose your sandwich with salad lunch special is very inexpensive but I won't be returning.

I love Thunderbird park. So many trails to choose from. With nice friendly people.   great for a beginner walker or  an experienced hiker.  I  visit every week. If are  you looking for a great place to take the family out for a nice walk with dog this is the park.

I feel sorry for anybody to think that this is good Mediterranean or Middle Eastern cuisine. I am from Dearborn Michigan the  largest Middle Eastern community America.I had Middle Eastern food and Mediterranean food made in people's homes that tastes better than this stuff they sell. A diet -conscious friend  and I was hungry so we decided to go there. I ordered the spinach pie thinking it would be good but the spinach pie was deep  and full of grease I never had  spinach pie  deep fried.. It literally made me sick me  to my stomach the guy will meet with like beef shavings wasn't even on authentic shawama bread he didn't even press it to prepare.some pieces of  the meat had had fat on it I orders a fatoush salada that not hard to make that was fair. The cook/owner even got a little upset with me when I was questioning him about the preparation of my sandwich. I would never visit there again and You don't believe me for yourself try some food here and go to another nearby Middle East restaurant that's not too far from them they make real Shawarma,s and try the food there and see for yourself !

I saw this restaurant on PBS and had to try it. The Ahi tuna melt and vegetarian spring rolls both are delicious. And of course for happy hour I had to try the pear margarita which was on point !

Not anywhere near A real Detroit coney island . It's more like hormal chilie out of a can.  I ordered a loose burger  instead I got a chop up hamburger patty  on a hot dog  bun. I work at a few coney island in detroit so i know that alot of them order from chicago beef .I ask why don't you  order from them and he told me that he dont order frozen food i ask him arent your fries frozen...LMAO my family and I laugh the entire time we were there. what a waste of time and money ! If you're from Detroit you'll know  !

The entertainment was awesome, the drinks were very good. It was quite crowded, but not uncomfortable. Great place for a date You can order food there, however, we had already eaten. The food delivered to other tables appeared quite tasty. Typical bar food  with no complaints. I will definitely visit again!

With my sister enjoying a relaxing weekend lunch and then off to the beauty salon for her new hair pixe cut. Well Happy Hour now  and its a Kentucky Cream Soda  Cocktail  with the sheared  Ahi tuna lettuce warps. Which both is delicious and light by the way. If you do visit make sure to ask Claudia  a very  knowledgeable young lady when it come to fine spirts and future sake connoisseur !
