Like Natalie's review below, it has been years since I have been here. It kind of fell off the radar and I have no idea why!   The service was great. I love the family atmosphere here. The food was incredible - and then the prices were 30% less than I would expect for that quality of food. Seriously - this place will never fall off the radar again.  We had two specials that night: Short Ribs with Canneloni (maybe the best canneloni I have ever had) and the Red Snapper in a lemon piccata with a side of linguine.  Perfection!  And not to mention the part about rarely finding good, fresh red snapper in the desert...  That is one of my favorite fish.  So glad it was on special!

It took me a very long time to find an Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area that I really enjoyed.  I had all the usual suspects in Scottsdale and Phoenix recommended to me, to varying degrees of success.  Most of them were good, but nothing that I would rather go to, than just make my own food at home.  A friend finally brought me to Marcellino's about 5 years ago, back when they were in North Phoenix (I miss that little place).    Since the first day I went, Marcellino has been serving some of the best handmade pasta that I have ever had.  But my absolute favorite are his lamb chops and filet.  With so many favorites to choose from, it's easier most days to just order the chef's tasting menu, which usually includes a duo of my some of my favorite appetizers (scallops, or mushroom polenta, or some buffalo mozzarella and tomato, etc.), a duo of pastas and a carne or a duo.    Not only is the food amazing, there is one server here in particular who always makes me feel like family, Scottie.  His knowledge of the menu, food, wine and the restaurant is flawless and his warm demeanor is incredibly welcoming.  His service takes this place a notch above the rest.

This place is great!  Awesome neighborhood spot. Great Thai food at really reasonable prices. The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes the food can be just a touch oily for my liking.  They listen really well and always get the spiciness right which both my fiancee and I appreciate as he loves spicy spicy food and I am more of a medium spicy girl.   Favorites: Thom Kha Soup with chicken and Spicy Cashew Chicken.

We have been regulars here for years. When they first opened I think I mentioned the food was a little oily. Must have been random bad luck.   The food here is delicious!!  You couldn't ask for a better neighborhood Thai spot. Nothing fancy just delicious food, always perfectly prepared, and really nice people here. We used to live really close and ate here once a week. Now that we live 12 miles away we still come here regularly. Our favorite Thai place around, hands down.   Favorites are still Tom Kha Gai, veggie rolls and SpicyCashew Nut Chicken.

Really good lentil soup.  Great rice.  Lamb combo was ok but everything else was pretty good!

I love this place.  Robert and Luanne are great.  Robert particularly makes me feel like family.  All the food here is so good it is hard to choose what to get.  A hot stuffed Croissant, with Ham and Swiss?  Chopped Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette?  A Sloppy Joe or French Dip when they are on special?  One of the awesome soups?  Too many decisions.

I've had some great business lunches here, but I have to say I was incredibly underwhelmed this last visit.  I took my fiancee and a friend in from out of town there.    Let's talk food: Since my fiancee and I usually each order an entree and switch halfway through dinner, for the first time ever, I ordered something other than a steak. I got the crab cakes and he got a T-bone. The steak was good - cooked right, tasted as expected, but to me, wasn't a $47 steak. That's the price I would expect of an exceptional steak.  Then there were the $43 crab cakes. When I first got them I was disappointed because there was so much creamy sauce on the plate and I am kind of a crab cake purist: lump crab meat, minimal filling, a little lemon and seafood seasoning.  After a few bites of really dry, not so tasty crab cakes I realized what the sauce was there for.  We left one whole crab cake on the plate after pushing food around and decided to just finish the steak and leave it alone.  I decided that I knew better of this restaurant and that i wanted to finish off dinner on a positive note. I decided to order dessert to erase the crab cake incident from memory. I ordered an apple crisp, which was barely better than the crab cake.  Bland soggy crust, overcooked apples, no "crisp" or topping other than the ice cream...  I had three bites and didn't eat any more of that despite being hungry.   Then there was the service: The waiter we had wasn't outright rude, but he definitely was not nice, kind or gracious, and it appeared that he had a bit of an attitude with our out of town guest who happened to be foreign (but speaks English).  He never once asked about the food. Leaving half your dinner and 90% of your dessert warrants at least a "Was everything ok?" which we definitely did not get.

Favorite dessert spot. We eat here weekly - and always an extra to go. Yum!  Lemon is the best flavor!

I love CostCo.  This location is a great CostCo because even when it's crowded its rarely over-crowded.  Much better than the FLW location.  It's a little smaller though, so there is slightly less variety.  I find better produce here than I do at most local grocery stores.  And free samples?!?!?  Who doesn't love free food?

This is one of only two pizza places that I will eat at in Arizona, and my first choice.  I'm not sure I would call it typical or traditional Chicago style, but it is excellent anyway.  I love the slightly sweet tomato sauce.  They also do an excellent job of telling you exactly when your pizza will be ready or delivered, which is very much appreciated.  Heads up, the 5 stars is for the pizza only.  The restaurant itself is kind of dingy.  The menu is extremely limited.  None if it really matters though when you serve the best pizza in the valley.  I actually order a pizza from here almost every weekend.

Another 5 star review from me - but no surprise here. We were heartbroken to hear about the sad news this summer but incredibly happy Johnnie's reopened. We've been regulars for over 6 years now. Favorite pizza place ever. You guys are the best.   Awesome thin crust pizza with a great tangy, sweet sauce.  We love the veggie version: olives, mushrooms, onions, green pepper, and sometimes we also add pepperoncini to half. They have really good side salads too. Lots of toppings and we sometime refer to them as our cheese salads for the extra helping of our favorite topping they give us.

This is my favorite sushi place in the valley.  I am glad it is near home.  Love the Poke here (not authentic - but they put a delicious spin on it)!  The sashimi is always fresh (sometimes a challenge for AZ sushi places).  I enjoy maki wrapped in cucmber and they have a few really good choices here for those.  Happy Hour is a steal and I like the Korean BBQ pork sliders a lot (which I hate to admit ordering these at a sushi restaurant with such great sushi).    My only negative is service can be hit or miss, even within a meal.  In this case, super attentive until dinner was served and then no water or drink service for quite a while.  We would have stayed a while and ordered more beers and drinks after dinner, but we decided to leave since it would have taken a while.

I am a Pita Jungle lover - so it is with a bit of frustration that I write this review.  I have wanted to try their Happy Hour tapas for years now.  I always stare at the $2 and $3 menu thinking a lot of things I love are on there and it would be great to get a meal of a ton of small plates.  So, I finally made it yesterday and what a disappointment.  I ordered the Lemon chicken and hummus (best two things), olives, feta, mussels, dolmades and falafel.    My first major problem with this visit was the amount of time it took to order everything.  I ordered in 3 rounds and it took a full 15-20 mins to get 2-3 tapas in each case.  That's a bit too long for the tapas I ordered.  Nothing should have taken more than 5 minutes to cook maximum.  And I was only one of 4 tables that were seated.    The olives, feta, dolmades and falafel were bland but ok.  Then comes the mussels, that were forced open so their shells were cracked when they were served.  So, now I waited 15 minutes for my feta (just lumps of cold feta cheese with a small garnish of tomato, cucumber and onion) and my inedible mussels (3-4 mins cooking time) in the empty restaurant.  When the server came back by 5 minutes later I explained to her what was wrong with the mussels and said I don't want these, and she confirmed "Oh yeah, that's bad" and walked away with them.  I mentioned after her, unknowing if she was going to put in another order which I would now no longer trust from there, I don't want a replacement order, and she said, "Yeah, I got it".  Never an apology, or any remorse in her voice, actually just the opposite - a little attitude.  Never an offer of a menu back to order something else - I was still hungry.  Oh well, it must have been a bad day because I have had this server before and she is generally lovely and on top of things.    Anyway, I will be back as usual, ordering my mediterranean chicken salad, but it will be to go as usual and I will not be trying the tapas again any time soon.

I've been going to Valley spas for about 10 years now, and while there are some fantastic, beautiful spas around, I still hadn't found the right massage therapist.  I finally found John.  I've never scheduled a massage on an "emergency basis".  After months of traveling without any down time, my body had finally said enough.  With how tight my shoulders, neck and lower back were I thought I must be walking around looking like Quasimodo.  Within one 60 minute session, I felt like the world had been righted.    I was a little hesitant trying someone new, based only on Yelp reviews, and going to their house, but when every single person who has done a review has concurred with 5 stars you know that something special is going on at Space.  I'm so glad I gave it a whirl!  I booked my follow up appointment before I even left.

I really enjoyed this place, and everything I have ordered there so far...  I went for the first time this week and later in the week sent my mom and brother because I liked it so much.    The original chopped salad was as delicious as always.  I had a hard time deciding between the scallops, the halibut and the meatloaf.  They were out of the halibut, so scallops and meatloaf it was.  The servers I spoke to were all very knowledgeable about the menu.  I am not sure I could pick one meal over the other next time.  I liked them both so much.  I guess I am always going to have to drag someone with me and do the ordering for the both of us.  I can't wait to try the bacon brittle.  :-)

Had dinner here for about the 10th time.  It is a great restaurant.  It never fails that I mention 2 or 3 places for dinner and whomever I am meeting says "What's Rusconi's?"  Gasp!  Where were you in 2013?  Consistently good food.  Always a couple of favorites on the menu with a few featured/specials/seasonal items peppered in.  Everything is very good.  Prices are really reasonable.  We had the scallops and the buffalo sirloin this time with, my favorite, a side of prickly pear cabbage (please don't ever take that off your menu).  Total dinner price for two entrees, a side and (non-alcocholic) drinks = ~$60.  Can't beat that!

I love this store.  The jewelry is beautiful and spans most prices ranges.  They have the best assortment of $20 fashionable earrings, if you are just looking for something fun to wear out on a weekend night.  The necklaces are always beautiful.    I love love love the clothes here as well.  I always find a maxi dress or two that I can't resist in the Illinois stores, and this store was no exception. I am really excited to have this store in my backyard here in AZ now.  Only little thing, maybe it's a Midwestern thing actually, the staff wasn't nearly as friendly or helpful as the Hinsdale stores.

Same type of experience as Anesia - I needed a new pair of jeans and happened to come in on a 50% off all women's clothing sale. I picked out a few things off the clearance rack, a few shirts that had a sign on a table that said $9.99 (not clearance and not 50% off of their original price), and the jeans. I got up to the register and asked - since clearance isn't always included in sales like this - if ALL women's clothing was included while holding up my clearance items. She said yes and of course when she rung me up it wasn't. No big deal - I half expected it wouldn't be - just annoying that the sales people even misrepresent the sale.     (I also verified the sign did have small print at the bottom excluding clearance.)   Then we get to my non-clearance shirts.  Since these weren't clearance and I bought one I liked a few weeks before, I spent some time trying on and picking out quite a few since it appeared to be such a good deal. Of course those conveniently weren't included in the sale either. Another cashier who appeared to be an asst. mgr or something came over and informed us also that these were not included in the sale. I asked if they were clearance. She said no. She wasn't willing to honor the pricing as marked. My fiancée pointed out that this "sale" made no sense because a few weeks prior without the 50% off we received the exact same deal and the shirts were marked the same.    The whole experience just left a really bad taste in our mouths and of course we were so annoyed we vowed not only would we not be returning to the Gap Outlet ever again, but no more outlet shopping before the holidays. This store is the worst!  Whatever consumer group checks false and misleading advertising should make a trip out here.

Its with sadness that I write this review. The online reviews are all raves (see below). The store looks beautiful. Its right down the street from my house - designer dresses at all price points. Phoenix not generally being a bastion of fashion, I was relatively sure I was going to end up trekking to LA or NY to end up getting my dress until I found Schaffer's online.   So flash forward to my first ever bridal dress shopping experience. When I made my reservation, I very clearly described the style of dress I was searching for, but also noted that I was open to trying some different styles to get a feel for not only what I liked, but what would look good on me.  I was assured on the phone that I would have lots of variety and we would spend time trying a few things to figure it out.  When I showed up and shared pictures of what I described on the phone, the sales lady realized immediately that they didn't have one dress that fit my requirements or anywhere near them. (Btw - which consisted of an open budget and the description of sheath style, silk or satiny material, and not strapless: not totally unreasonable requests.)  The sales lady was really kind, and very complimentary of my taste and aesthetic, but it didn't help the fact that there was not one style as I described it, and that nobody warned me that my options would be limited or nonexistent when I made my appt.  I wasted everyone's time, including the people who were with me at my appt. and drove 40 mins to get there from South Phoenix.  So, to kind of recover and not make it a total bust I tried to prod for dresses that other girls my age, size, style had been buying lately. Maybe I could try a few of those on and see if anything struck me. Instead I was told what I was looking for was probably the right thing and there wasn't any other style she could suggest.   Yes, I walked out of the store without trying on one dress, while my incredibly sweet family tried to cheer me up and tell me not to be disheartened, I sit here, writing this review, totally disheartened and not looking forward to something that everyone else tells me is one of the most fun parts of getting married.
