I liked this Starbucks, parking was plenty, there was a good amount of inside seating with outlets for your techno gadgets, and staff was so nice. I'm a green member so I get free refills on coffee and tea, she actually let me change my drink though from tea to coffee on my refills and gave me samples to test which coffee was best :) On the down side the bathrooms were dirty and there seemed to be a wait for coffee.

I came in here to get breakfast with a friend, initially I was thinking "we're getting breakfast at a furniture store?!". She kept saying how great it was and I thought whatever I'll trust you.  We walked in and went to the cafeteria. I felt like I was at some urban/chic place. After finishing the food which was surprisingly good we begin to look at furniture. It was like walking through a museum with individual cubicles of bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms, and sometimes a combo of all looking like a studio apartment.  We toured the place for over an hour and had a blast! Didn't even end up buying anything lol.

Employees were friendly, however they were more concerned with talking to each other instead of cutting hair. The girl who cut my hair actually stopped several times to chat with the other workers. Its very expensive as well, $15 for a haircut and they wanted $15 to blow-dry, excluding any type of styling. Won't go back.

The food was great, I had a root beer float and a chicago dog. Also I was surprised at how clean the restaurant was.

This Starbucks is great! Large amount of seating inside and a bit outside under a nice shady tree. Store was clean and staff was nice. It's right along bell, a busy street, however this didn't even phase me as I was inside studying. The store can be busy at times but the wait is never long for a drink and there is always plenty of seating available.

I workout and volunteer here. Its a great gym with all your needs and a range of activities. Also the employees are all fantastic, very nice, and yet keep things at a professional level.

This place is great! They have plenty of seating inside with outlets if you want to bring a laptop, perfect for studying, and I've never had more then one person in line in front of me. Staff was very friendly and the place seemed to be well kept.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon for some Bloody Mary's with a friend. This place is a nice dive bar and surprisingly large in size. Perfect if you want to bring a group and host an event. They have beach volley ball in the back along with another bar. The crowd here comes in a variety as well, it's not like your walking down Mill. Can't wait to come back!

Me "I need that green ice thing, it's the color of pistachio pudding, and I want a large" Starbucks "One venti green tea frappuccino?" Me "yeah that one!" Oh how you understand me Starbucks :) Staff was very friendly here, they have nice seating and outlets for doing a bit of work or reading. I came here on a Sunday and it was pretty busy, only negative was the floors were dirty.

I tanned at this place for about a month however was not impressed by the staff. They were very rude and they didn't seem to care about their customers. One time I walked in when two employers were there and they chatted among themselves for a good minute before getting to me. Only thing I can say is that the beds were clean. There is better places then this one.

Very friendly staff, reasonable prices, and they have an ASU student discount. They told it would take 30 minutes for my oil change and it took 20. I would go back.

Food had great flavor and was fairly cheep for sushi. My friend and I got 6 smalls plates of sushi plus cheesecake that was split among us and it was $13 total! People were very friendly, only thing was it was kinda dead however it was a Sunday. Some of the food ends up being room temp as well since it's rolling around, however you can order fresh. I'd would definitely come back.

This place was fantastic!! We went there on a Saturday after being at Standup Scottsdale. Heard it had closed about 6 times so we were slightly skeptical but tried it anyway. It's a nice little dive bar with cheap drinks ($11 for 3 drinks), chalk boards all along the walls to draw on, an arcade in the back with classic games from the 80's, free fresh made popcorn. It's a little off the beaten path, but it's worth the trip.

This restaurant really looks like a lodge on the inside. There is plenty of seating plus a full bar both inside and out along with a few games, pool table. Food is great! Be sure to get the sweet potato fries with campfire sauce  Service was okay, we weren't even sitting at the bar and the bar tender was a lot more attentive then the waitress.
