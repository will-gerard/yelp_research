I'm the Duke of this place, so I know. I love this Pub, most people think being a pub means it serves food.  Not true, traditionally, pubs were drinking establishments, and this is what O'Connor's Pub is.  Sometimes people bring food in though.  The drinks are on the cheap side and good, Guinness comes in 20 OZ pints, are are cheaper than other places around.  The bartenders and Jukebox are what make this place shine.  The jukebox is among the best in the valley, anything you want from classic country to punk rock, and of course good Irish songs.  The bartenders are super nice, but won't put up with any shit.  That is what I like about them!   Oh, and don't forget the live music - Dirt Music Express are awesome, and so is Shay Veno.

Great place to go if you want to be ripped off, and intimidated. My Friends and I were having a going away party for a guy from work, got there a little early, maybe seven and took a seat.  About 20-30 mins later a bouncer made us move, to put a table together for a large party.  Also mentioning he gets a $50 tip for letting people sit there.  So we moved, bouncer did buy us a drink.  At our new table the waitress told us we had to have an open tab to sit there.  I said okay, and gave her my card, but told her we were going to pay cash.  She was fine with that.  So we had an okay time, they did have some hot girls working there, and my friends sprang for a lap dance for me, and the girl was dam good at it. (which is why they get two stars).  So time comes for us to close out and leave.  The waitress brings us our check, which to my surprise came out to over $100.  I pointed out to her that we had been paying cash for our drinks like our dances and tips.  Not only that, but the beers the bouncer had bought us were also on there, along with drinks we did not order, none of us will touch tequila.  So I complained and then a bouncer came along and told us in no uncertain terms we were going to pay for the drinks he saw us drink.  After I complained, the bouncer relented and had the waitress take off the drinks we did not drink, but we paid twice for the drinks we did have.

This place has perhaps the best Sushi in AZ.  The Maki Rolls are a little outlandish at times, but good.  The Nigiri and Sashimi is where the place shines.  Fish is very Fresh and very high quality, and well served.  It comes at the right temperature, not  too cold as at many places.  And the Deep fried ice cream is too die for, comes with deep fried Bananas & Strawberries!.  Staff is Friendly, makes good suggestions and allows you to order as you go, unlike a lot of Sushi places.  The Sushi Chefs here are nice and attentive, but definitely are kept busy.

Eddie the owner really knows how to trim a beard.  It is hard to find someone who does a really good thorough job.  I have had my hair cut by one of the ladies who works there and it was a good cut.   Also, the shoe shine guy there is top notch. Prices are on par for what you pay downtown.

This place has really good Sushi, but note, they only serve Sushi and Drinks, and a smattering of Japanese Apps. Like Gyoza and Tempura. Having said that, the staff is really nice, even when they were super slammed like they were tonight.  The Sushi and Sashimi itself is really top notch.  I usually stick the the traditional forms of Sushi (Sushi, Sashimi, Hand Rolls)  My girl likes the Americanized Maki or roll types.  I was converted to the American Maki at this place.  It was all well balanced, and really, really delicious.  Try the Rasta Roll, it was awesome. All in all a really good place to go for Sushi.

I am the Duke of O'Connors pub, but I love Tim Finnegan's too.  I go there to drink, I come here to eat.  The hot wings are nothing short of awesome, I have them at least once a week.  Oh, and the Cod and Chorizo is awesome, It is my favorite fish dish in Phoenix.  Shepard's pie is made with lamb, like it should be!  Corned Beef and Cabbage is also really good, not as good as my Mom's but close.  The bartenders (usually Tommy and /or Jimmy) and wait staff take good care of their customers, especially their regulars.  When they have live music it is usually pretty good, but the week night people have been so so as of late.  Not my thing, but they do draw somewhat of a crowd.  Weekends are much better.  Come to see any of  the Irish Bands, or Carvin Jones.  Trivia on Tuesdays is awesome, it is run by Cedar the Duke of this place. Look for Team Beef and Titties!

Man this place is/was? really good, great goulash, great sausages, yummy potato pancakes, a really good beer selection.  Last time I went by there, the door was locked, but there were still goods on the shelves, and sausages in the case.  Their website is still up as well.  I really hope it is not closed for good.

Seriously, JR's fish and chips? Try JR's Fish Sticks and Fries.  You are better off saving some money and going to the Fry's across the street and buying frozen pre-battered fish, and frozen fries.

I love Antique Sugar, they actually carry clothing for Men I would (and do) wear.  I bought a sweet Lacoste Cardigan there, and they have really cool Western Shirts.  Quite a lot of vintage T's as well. Their stuff for women seems cool, and they have interesting vintage Jewelry.

I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.  First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.  Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.  Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.  Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.     Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here. No value  Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak. My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.  Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.  Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!

I may never eat Breakfast again, I think I am still full.  This place is owned by the same people who own Tuck Shop- Maybe my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  The place is smallish- but cool.  Tables can be hard to come by, but if 2 people are sitting at a 4 top, ask them nicely, and they will switch to your 2 top.  It is worth the wait, because the food and coffee are awesome.  I had the BMOC, it was perfection on a plate- sweet, smoky, salty, runny, savory.  It was also about 2000 calories, but it was worth every bite!  I also did not eat again for 10 hours.  I ordered just coffee, it was good stuff.  My girlfriend got a Caramel something or other- she really liked it.  I'll be back.

Someone must have talked to the staff about their poor service in the past few weeks, at least at the bar. I was asked 3 or 4 times while waiting for my drink, if I needed a drink.  I also got my complete change back.  But really adding tax in a bar- who does that?  I must say the female bartender I ordered from knew her Beer, she asked my girlfriend what she liked, then brought her a few samples, one of which was dead on.  I was actually kinda impressed.  My only complaint about the bar was they said they had 550 bottles in the cooler, but no one knew what bottles they had.  It all went downhill from there, I went into the back room, which was empty.  I found out it was empty because it was rented out to a private party.  On a Friday.  At least the waitress was nice about it, but no sign or anything letting me know ahead of time.  As luck would have it I find a table with 3 other people right after I was kicked out of the vault room.  However, at the table the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA I drank must have doubled as an invisibility portion-  The waitress waiting on the bros on either side of me either could not see us, or seemed to think our empty glasses meant we were too old to have another beer, apparently she does not know thirty somethings have real jobs and can leave tips.  I'd go back... if I rented out the back room, otherwise Mellow Mushroom has a comparable beer selection at least on tap.

I have to chime in here seeing those B.S. 5 star reviews.  I usually give new places a pass, because I figure they have some kinks to work out, but when I see people shilling for them, I feel it ruins the purpose of yelp.  First, the Bartenders and waitresses are not knowledgeable about mixed drinks, and rather rude.  I ordered a Manhattan, the drink the waitress brought me was made with Scotch.  When I complained, she told me "Manhattans are always made with Scotch", she left out the, Duh.  But the tone was clear.  Except, Manhattans are made with Whiskey, traditionally Rye. NEVER Scotch. I insisted, and got a new one, it was passable.  Next, not wanting to deal with the B.S. I order a Maker's Mark on the rocks.  Decent pour, but when I got the bill it was $2 extra.    Now I asked the waitress, and she told me it was extra because a rocks pour is larger.  I find this dubious at best.  The drinks were already pricey, so this just galled me.  If you are looking for a slice of Scottsdale Downtown, I guess this place is ok for you, but I won't be back.

You drive past, you see this place.  The sign says Tacos Kissi, then you see it says tacos and sushi.  You think this is weird.  You drive past.  You have just made a huge mistake. Do yourself a favor go in.  Eat some tacos, then try the sushi, cause, what the heck, right? The sushi is delicious.  It is not traditional at all, start with the Kissi roll, then try the Mar Y Tierra.  Surf and turf all in one. The tacos are incredible, all tortillas are made in house, and the meats are great.  My favorite is the tripas.  Crunchy yet soft.  The carne asada is also great. Come back, try a torta.   You will be back again, and again.
