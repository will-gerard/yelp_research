Went here for brunh a few weeks ago and I've been contemplating on going back sometime soon! The food is delicious, I had the tortilla espanol. Not sure why they call it tortilla since it doesn't have any but either way, it was great. Perfect meal size for brunch. Nice music selectionn! Like I said before, I can't wait to go back!

The first time I went to this place I was skeptical due to the walk down a dark alley and into the basement. After being there the rest of the night. I loved everything about this place. The positive energy, music and the setting. Not to mention the awesome people that work there. This is now my go-to place!

I've been coming to this place for over 5 years but they recently changed management and the quality of their work is really good but their attitude is honestly the worse! They don't greet when you walk in the door, they stare you dowb as if you had arrived from another planet and every question I was answered with attitude. Im not sure if the girl with long hair is the owner but she's got serious attitude problem. I gave a 1 star only because 0 stars is not an option. They have officially lost my business!

Food is great, the patio is small but makes a cozy place to talk, feels just like a home patio. I had the farmyard vegetable scramble with a coconut latte. Staff is very friendly and accommodating not to mention how fast they had our food ready.   Definitely coming back!

I was at this place for the grand opening on 1/8/2016. It was great! We need more places like these. Super chill ambiance, great people, and music was on point the whole time I was there! Arcades were free the whole night so I got the chance to play different ones and relive my childhood memories! Everyone MUST check this place out!
