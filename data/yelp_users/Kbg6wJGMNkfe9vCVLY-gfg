This is the first experience I've had with Z Cleaners and it will be my last. I specifically went to this cleaner because I wanted to ensure that my dress was in good hands and assumed the high prices meant quality and dependability, and I was very wrong.   I brought in a dress to be cleaned for a special occasion, one in which was out of state, and needed by a specific day and time before my flight. Two hours before my dress was to be ready for pick up I received a phone call saying that they unfortunately put a solution on my dress they were unable to remove. I was told my dress was not only not going to be ready, but that it could be completely ruined. They said they needed to soak it for 24 hours to try to undo the damage. I agreed as I really had no option, and was stuck having to make arrangements to make a quick trip to the mall while I was at my destination for the occasion. This was an additional expense and time I did not have prior to the event. Not only that, the solution didn't work, and my beautiful dress was destroyed.  When I arrived back to town I went into the cleaner to pick up my damaged dress and talk to them about the reimbursement for it. They offered me way below 50% of the value of the dress and told me that because due to "depreciation" it wasn't worth more, and continued to tell me that because it wasn't replaceable that it should be worth less, not more. I refused to settle for the insult offer, and was told to wait even longer for a resolution. The owner said that he would need to talk to his "staff" to determine if I deserved more for their error. If I would have been told the dress could have been ruined with a cleaning, I absolutely would have not opted for it. Not only does this place lack in quality, the customer service and disregard for people and their concerns is absurd. If I could rate them zero stars I would. I will hear on Monday as to what they "choose to offer me" and hope that they'll redeem themselves, unfortunately with their track record I feel that it's unlikely. Standby for an update.

I have been a customer at Energy Tanning on Hayden & McCormick Pkwy for about a year now. The salon and beds are consistently clean, and the staff always friendly. The people who work at the front desk always remember who I am and sign me in upon walking into the door. The beds are always available, and its the first time I have been a member at a salon, where I never had to wait. I have been tanning in total for 7 years- and I'd have to say, in all my experience, that I would recommend this salon over any of the rest.

Love it. The decor in this place is like nothing I've seen- it's warm and comfortable, while also being quirky and charming. There are a ton of huge screens for football games, basket ball, and I've even seen UFC fights on.   My friends and I have had both waitresses and bartenders serve us, and they're always polite, attentive, kind and accommodating. Which, of course, isn't something you typically see in Old Town. The security staff is equally kind and patient.   The food is awesome. I have had breakfast and dinner at this spot, and both were equally delicious. I highly recommend the breakfast bowl, something so wonderful wouldn't seem to be healthy- but it is... Ground turkey, avocado, bacon, sweet potatoes, eggs and served with homemade salsa on the side. For dinner I've had the fish sandwich with curly fries- melts in your mouth. My friend had the chicken salad, and she's raved about that for a week now. Oh, and Butter Cake- need I say more?   Seeing the place has a great atmosphere, staff, and awesome food and drinks(did I mention the Fireball on tap?), this is definitely me and my girlfriends new spot!
