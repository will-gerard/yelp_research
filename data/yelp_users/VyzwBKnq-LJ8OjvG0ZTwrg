I was excited to try this place and when I saw the travelzoo deal I jumped on it. I was trying to think of the best way to describe their food and it reminded me of convention center food.  I think they have catered to too many weddings and have lost the art of cooking quality meals.  This is also one of those places where you get the feeling that its cool to pay more for less. We were seated inside after requesting a patio seat and we brought the average age down about 30 years. It was hot and stuffy and the seats were so uncomfortable I had to take some advil when I got home. Had the worst french onion soup I've ever seen/ eaten (not sure how you mess that up?) and the salmon was too salty even for me.  I'm would not consider myself a food snob but I have eaten plenty of good food and this place just doesn't make the cut.  The only plus side to our dinner was being able to walk around the mansion and see the decor afterwards.  If we had actually been able to sit on the patio I"m sure the view would have been nice.  In summary....  Average age: 65  Food quality: sub par  Decor: antique  Bill with discount: $110  Recommend? NO

Just called to get an estimate on roof damage from the wind.  Receptionist asked if I was already a customer.  I said no.  She said they no longer accept new customers because they are so overbooked from the hail storm back in October.  Well sucks for you cause I needed an entire new roof people!  Would steer clear of them.

This is by far the best sushi in the west valley.  I have eaten here for the past 3 years and love it.  Only once was the sushi a little sub par but it was a very busy night and I think the sushi guys were overworked.  99% of the time its PERFECT!   My all time favorite is the yummy roll... the sauce is amazing.

This used to be my favorite go to for west valley sushi but repeat visits have disappointed.  Last week when I arrived with a guest the place was about 25% full and we were told to sit at the small table which is reasonable but I knew we wanted to split the sushi boat ( big wooden boat with sushi and sashimi) which does not fit well in the small tables.  I asked to be seated at a larger table and told they were all taken for reservations.  After I explained why I wanted to sit at one the attitude changed to now allowing me to occupy the table.  Since he was sooooo concerned about loosing business to larger parties we just sat at the small table.  No one ever occupied the large (4 seat tables) while we finished our $90 meal.  I'm pretty easy going but I wont be back based on the attitude of the owner.

This was the second time I've been here and I will be back! My husband and I were going to see a comedian at the Improv and we decided to eat here since it was close.  We just got a few appitizers because we were in a hurry but they were great.  The sauce on the chicken rolls is amazing and the service is  good even though its always packed.

I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but.. well.. let me explain.    I came in on a Friday around 5:15pm trying to catch an early dinner. I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had "reserved" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy.   The restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise.   The food is best described as "home cooking". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland?   Overall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself. As for me I did like the restaurant and their owners but I think I will only return for the soup in the future, which I would gladly give 5 stars.

I had been searching for a church since I moved here and have had a hard time finding one I liked. I avoided CCV for a long time because I thought the messages would be superficial and weak since it was obvious the building itself was worth a few million and seemed cultish with their CCV window stickers. I WAS WRONG!   The grounds are absolutely stunning and some of the people there are too. However I found on my first attendance that I was warmly welcomed and Pastor Don's message was enlightening and inspiring. My worry that they would not stay true to the word quickly dissipated. I have never been a big fan of worship music but my first time there they played viva la vida by coldplay which was a nice surprise. I have come to enjoy some of the performers (Danny is my favorite) and try my best not to be late! There are a ton of ways to become involved even though it is a very large church so if you are looking I would definitely check it out.

I went here with family back in the 90's while on vacation and fell in love.  I now live in Phoenix but in the west valley.  It is almost an hour away and I will gladly drive all the way to Mesa to eat the best Mexican food in Arizona!

Bought a deal on Groupon and finally made it over there. It is set up strangely with two rooms not connecting but this has no impact on their service. We got their early and were warmly greeted by whom I can only assume to be the owner himself as he was answering the phone. The tortilla soup was some of the best I have had in a long time and the entrees did not disappoint. I'm a sucker for goat cheese and my chicken was absolutely amazing! My husbands pork was very flavorful too (he was sweating that's how I know it was good). Our drinks were filled just at the right times and we left very satisfied customers.  I would love to come back again for happy hour if/when I'm on the east side again.

I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!

Spoke with Jeff a few hours ago and now I have 4 new locks.  Not only did I get excellent locksmithing (if that's a thing) he also fixed my door that's been misaligned for the past few years!  Would highly recommend.

I usually enjoy a trip over to Pappadeaux but last night was the worst dining experience I've had in years. We were quoted a 10-20 min wait time... no biggie... ended up waiting 55 min to be seated. It is spring training and spring break so not a big deal because we did arrive at 7pm. The problem is we left at 10:30pm! I ordered the seasonal craw fish as an appetizer since I had an hour to look over the menu I ordered right away. Took 45 min to get the craw fish out and when they came there was an old dehydrated piece of corn with scraps of potatoes. I had watched other tables getting several pieces of corn with large potatoes so we must have been given the "left overs". It was truly pathetic. We ended up just getting the gumbo since we had already filled up on bread and my real motivation to eat here was the dessert. We ordered two desserts and after 15 min our waitress only brought out one (she forgot the other one). Our waitress was nice but just not good at her job. Every time she knew she messed up she would have the manager come to our table instead of just explaining to us what had happened. It was a long confusing $50 app, soup, and dessert. I would recommend going at 2pm for a stress free dinner!

Let me preface this review by saying that it is hard for me to give any Cameroon Mitchell restaurant a bad review since it used to be the standard of creativity and perfection I grew up on and loved. I lived in Columbus and Cap City was one of my favorite spots to date. I even had my wedding rehearsal dinner at The Fish Market (before he sold it to Ruth Chris). I love Cameroon Mitchell restaurants and when I heard that one was coming to the valley my husband and I were thrilled! We went a week after opening and since it was a while ago I can't give you specific details but I remember that that calamari was made exactly the way it was made at Cap city which was fantastic! We did have issues with our server taking over a half our to bring our soup. The carrot cake was also very similar to Cap City and since it was always my favorite, I was in heaven. I wasn't thrilled with that visit due to the long looooong wait for our soup then meals but I chalked it up to being a new restaurant.   We hadn't been back in a while (due to distance) so we tried to make reservations for New Years Eve. They were booked so no biggie we decided to go on Sunday instead. I've never been more disappointed in my food expectations! The calamari had changed completely. It was not terrible but not what I wanted (candied cashews?) and our entrees were sub par. My Sea bass tasted like it was seasoned with Lowery's season salt and was undercooked. My husbands swordfish was OK but again.... not what we were expecting after eating at The Fish Market for years. I love sweet potato fries and ours were soggy. I have had better ones ones at Outback, Le Chatlet, and at Arrowhead Grill. Maybe it was crappy because all the chiefs were hung over from new years day? I couldn't really say but for $130 bill for an app, a side, and 2 entrees that were very blan I would go elsewhere! As for the Cameroon Mitchell chain... looks like I will have to fly back to Columbus to enjoy the perfection.

I attended the 2010 championship game; Schoolyard Scrappers Vs. Coffin Draggers.   This was my first ever roller derby and I was not sure what to expect. I assumed that everyone there would be covered with tattoo's and sloshin booze all over the place and I was surprised to see such a mix of people in the audience. There was a mix of tats & boozers but there were also many couples and families. The rules were explained at the beginning of the game (which was nice since I had no clue) and the excitement of the crowd continued to heighten with each race. The Schoolyard scrappers did a great job but they just couldn't keep up with Satan's little helper from the Coffin Draggers.   My complaints: the cost  Parking is $10 per car  VIP seats $20 (only way you can see skaters up close)    I am not a sports fan but if I had to watch an event it would be roller derby all the way.  The girls are great and the crowd loves them! If I had to sum up roller derby I would say its a mix of Nascar, WWE, and suicide girls all wrapped up into one event.

I thought this place was supposed to be good? I bought the groupon based on others reviews and something has changed!   We decided to order every appetizer on the menu to get a good variety of foods. We didn't finish a single plate because they were so ......gross. The waiter felt bad that we didn't eat any of our soup and he was kind enough to take it off our bill. I've never in my life had lobster bisque that did not have lobster in it. It was super salty and had mushrooms? I'm all for reinventing the wheel but come on why not just call it mushroom bisque? It was probably the worst soup I've ever had. I was excited to try the crab app but it was bland and I had a sinking suspicion that food poising may result and I didn't touch it. The chicken wings were the best thing we ordered because the cheese platter was practically inedible. I looked at the menu online before we went and the menu they had in the restaurant was completely different. I asked what was up and they said they had a new chief. I suspect this is the cause very obvious change in opinions over the past few months. The 2 stars are for the waiters alacrity to refill our ice teas or I would give negative stars if that were possible.   *If your planning on going on a sunday be advised that they no longer have brunch.

Can you say food poisoning?   It was obvious as we walked in the door that this place was trying to cut down on expenses. They had turned off the air conditioning when it was 100 degrees outside and had large ceiling fans going on full blast. This was highly irritating as the fans not only dried out my food but did a number on my eyes also. The women waitresses were very kind and at times almost too eager to take our order as we were asked by three different people what we wanted. When we got our sushi for two it was WARM! I'm not talking about good old fried Las Vegas roll warm, I'm talking shashimi over rice. I've been to several countries and eaten plenty of raw things and assumed it would be ok since about 99% of the time my stomach can handle it. I was wrong. I wonder now if they had turned down the cooling case where the sushi is stored? I would bet if the health department did a random inspection they are not keeping it kept at the right temperature.   To top off the lukewarm fish, the people at the table next to us got drunk and started yelling at the waitress about being overcharged. I really should give them more stars just for the entertainment value of watching them try to communicate to drunken hillbillies.   Well the joke was on me because I soon realized what they were angry about. We came with a groupon and they applied the discount after tax. They don't print out an itemized bill they just give you the paper with the total so you don't really know what your bill was.... But I'm on to you Fresh Wasabi! I don't know on what planet they thought that was ok because I have never NEVER been to a place that does this. Our bill was only about $40 so a few dollars here or there was not a big deal to me but to the hillbillies who racked up a $180 bill it was a big deal. After many threats from the drunks to call the police they finally left and as our entertainment factor dwindled we vowed never to trek out to Surprise for irritable bowls ever again.

Don and his guys did work for us a few years ago. I had a really hard find finding a competent contractor in glendale and after interviewing 5 different companies I knew Just Remodel would do the best job. We had our guest bath room shower surround and a new cast iron tub installed and love the new look. My only complaint is that I've tried to do more work with them and I never can get a return phone call? Maybe they didn't like us but we loved their work! =o)

My windshield was broken by the 10/05/10 hailstorm.  I just got my estimate completed today and called Safelite at 1pm to schedule a replacement installation.  Chris was at my house by 3pm and did an excellent job!  He made sure he covered my driver/passenger seat with plastic so nothing would damage them in the process.   This was not done before when I had a replacement so I was impressed.  After replacing my windshield ( in blazing AZ afternoon heat ) and cleaning it off he cleaned the rest of my windows too!  Above and beyond what I expected!!!

I've tried my fair share of conveyer belt sushi restaurants in Oregon, Hawaii, California and Arizona.  My simple conclusion.... This is the best one I've ever been to!  Normally I want to try every 4th or 5th item that rolls around due to personal preference or based on quality of the roll.  I wanted to try them all!!! The quality was excellent, the Tatum was my favorite and I will be back.  My only reason for not giving 5 stars was because I was sitting near the back where the waiters were cleaning the menus with 409 spray. Kuddos for cleanliness but the overwhelming bleach smell made me want to vomit and killed my appetite, next time I'll ask to be seated somewhere else.

I couldn't be happier with the service the birddoggers did on my leaking house!  Woke up this morning and my shower would NOT turn off.  I called and they were able to come to my house and fix it in under and hour, in what world does that usually happen and on a Saturday no less?   Their price was fair and reasonable, I would highly recommend them and will call them in the future if I have another plumbing crisis!

I was excited to try some place new for my birthday especially since it was nearby in the west valley, however the excitement quickly disappeared after the appetizer came.  We overheard a waitress tell some people that this place used to be called Bravi Tuscan Kitchen and they didn't change the menu.  TOO BAD they should have!!! Everything I ordered was bland and simply just not good.  The side of veggies I got looked like warmed up left over pizza toppings and I could microwave better chicken Parmesan at home.  The waitress was polite and kept are drinks full so that's a plus but I will not be returning.  Maybe check it out if you feel like socializing and drinks but skip it otherwise.
