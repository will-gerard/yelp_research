Dump!!!   Now that said it can be pretty inexpensive if you want a place to train solo.    On the other hand ...I signed up to train with a trainer and within a week of signing up the trainer leaves to go to another location.  They don't have another trainer that can train me when I need BUT they hold me to my contract.  Long story short $2500 for a few sessions with trainers half as good as what you'd find anywhere else in the area.

The Tempe improv is  always a great bet on a Friday night and very rarely disappoints.   My server Collin was fast, thorough and highly attentive a supremely tough task for someone who has to work in the dark and in a very tight spot.

We always enjoy the Tempe Improv. The first show on Friday night has become a bit of a tradition to finish off the workweek. We always try to get seated in Kellyns section. He's fast!!!!!!! And never will he let your drinks go dry which is a tough challenge in a venue like that.

Great service and the BEST iced coffee I've ever had... That said DO NOT... I repeat do not have more than one.  We are both seasoned coffee drinkers and we were kept up till 2:00 am 4 hrs past bed time.

First time I've ever had an open table reservation not honored.  I'm not sure what to think about these people.  I get there at 5:55 for a 6:00 reservation. They don't have a table.  10 minutes later I'm offered a high top.  Seriously?  Is it just me or wouldn't you hold actual tables for opentable customers?  Anyway 6:25 we have a table. Food was ok at best.  The charcuterie plate might as well have been served on an Oscar Meyer plate.

I grew up in new orleans and consider myself an AUTHORITY on seafood.  The crawfish at this place is nothing short of INCREDIBLE!!!!  I felt like I was at a neighborhood restaurant going to town.  Spice level was perfect,  heads perfect, pealability perfect...

Great food today as usual. That's said... Service was an atrocity..have you ever experienced service so inept and with such bad attitude that it becomes entertainment????
