I'm a big fan of family owned restaurants, especially ethnic, so you can only imagine my excitement when I found a Peruvian restaurant here in the desert.  Sad to say, this is one restaurant I will not be returning to.  The food was bland and lacked flavor.  It almost like they ran out of "ALL SPICES" right before we ordered (yes including salt and pepper).  To start of we ordered an appetizer, the Papa a la Huancaina, sliced boiled potato served at room temperature covered with a cold, bland, bright boldish yellowish colored hollandaise/mayonnaise sauce. Let's just say it was a start to a bad meal.  For the main course we ordered the Lomo Saltado, generous chunks of beef sauted with onions, tomatoes, and potatoes which sad-to-say was probably the best dish we had.  The dish was uninspiring, something you could find at a sit-down chain restaurant.   Nothing about the dish screamed Central American flavors.  We also had the Jalea, a combination of breaded octopus, shrimp, and chunks of fish fillet topped with a Peruvian Salsa (a.k.a. your standard chunky and fresh pico de gallo, (tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and lime juice)). I have never in my life had something that was breaded and deep-fried so soggy in my life!!!  The breading was heavy and disgusting.  It also came with the worst plantains I've ever had.  Dry, overcooked, and extremely chewy.  Put it this way, I've had better plantains at Bahama Breeze then this place (yes I said Bahama Breeze).  I am not trying to pick on this place.  I swear!!!  But when the owner's brother helps you order and tells you what they are known for and what they make best and they miss horribly?  Well, needless to say I can only imagine what there non-staple dishes taste like.  Not to beat up on these nice folks too much.  They place was cute.  The place was painted in a vibrant yellowish/brownish mustard type color, which gave the place a warm and bright feel.  On one wall was a mural of what was to resemble a village in Peru.  The other wall was a collection of trinkets from the native land and of course the flag of Peru.  The servers were extremely nice.  Beware, when you order water, they bring out bottled (and charge you), so if you want tap you need to ask and depending on your Spanish or their lack of English, that may be a challenge.   I hate to say this because the place was quaint and the help was friendly, but if you have a craving for Central American and/or Peruvian food, don't waste your money or time here. I'm just going to wait till the next time I'm back east in NY or DC/Northern VA to get real and tasty Peruvian food and I would suggest you do the same.

My friend Amanda introduced me to this spot 10 years ago when it was a total local spot where the old timers and a small community of people in the know, knew about.  Well the word has gotten out over years.  It's a solid breakfast option for SoCha.  The spot is a total greasy spoon with standard breakfast affair.  Chorizo or Denver omelet are both filling and solid choices.  Looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth?  The pancakes and French toast will do the trick.  Four thumbs up from my two girls.  Hash browns are always solid with a nice crust from the flat top.  Gourmet? No.  Just classic breakfast affair done fairly well at a reasonable price.  I did mention greasy spoon, right?  They are a big fan of butter, lots of butter.  FYI, they have recently raised their prices.  Most items are now closer to $8 to $9 versus $5 to $7 price point in the past.  Kids menu still $5.  If you are going there on the weekends, go early, because they place fills up quickly.  In my opinion, it's a gem in Chandler.  Where else can you walk pass airplane hangers and watch planes take off and land?  If Yelp would allow  1/2 stars, this would qualify for 3.5 stars, not quite 4.0.

You want a great meal, anytime of the day, come here; just don't come here for the service.  The servers are nice, but service is slow, real slow.  Anyways, this eclectic neighborhood diner is tucked away in what is known as the Scottsdale Mall (not Scottsdale Fashion Square), right next to SMOCA and the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center.  Breakfast I'm a big fan of breakfast and this is one of my favs in Phoenix.  If you are in the mood for something warm, hearty, and filling, or if you are a fan of corned beef/corned beef hash as I am, you have to get the white flannel.  The corned beef is not that oily or fatty like most others.  This one just seems to be very hearty and filling.  The combination of the corned beef with the white onions, mushrooms, garlic and sour cream hits the spot.  If you are in the mood for something sweet, I would go with their monkey cakes (banana pancakes).  The banana slices in the pancake are nice warm and gooey, just totally hits the spot.  The batter of the pancake is pretty good, moist more on the heavy than the fluffy side, wish the edges were crispy, but I'm not complaining.  Trust me.  The jalapeo pancakes with walnuts is another great dish, a strange pairing but it works!!!  The maple syrup is jalapeo infused which gives you a hint of the jalapeo flavor without the heat.  I love the fact that it's regionally influenced and, I also love the sweet and the heat of the dish.  Omelets also hold their weight.  The Monaco Omelet with roasted red peppers, garlic, and basil is a good choice.  The Salmon Omelet with smoked salmon, tomatoes, capers, cream cheese and chives is also good, very rich and creamy.  Now let's talk lunch!!!  Okay, first and foremost, the Arrogant Bastard Burger is one of my top 5 burgers off all time!!! Delux has absolutely nothing on this place or burger.  It's probably the best burger in AZ.  No joke.  The  lb burger is made with Arrogant Bastard Beer; hence the name of the burger but the burger is juicy and the combination of provolone, crispy bacon, red onion, tomatoes, mayo and their homemade BBQ sauce totally works on a toasted/grilled bun, although the red onions are abnormally spicy.  PLEASE, do not take anything off.  Trust me.  If anything, ask for extra BBQ sauce and mayo.  Trust me.  FYI, their burgers do not come with fries.  But trust me when I say this, the burger is so delicious and filling that you won't notice it.  The Reuben is somewhere between solid and outstanding.  It is also probably on my top 8 Reubens of all time.  The sauerkraut is absolutely delicious on its own.  It has a warm soury taste that I love (think artichoke hearts); actually, I wouldn't be surprised if that is what is in their sauerkraut that makes it soooo yummy!!! The Russian dressing that they lather on is tasty as well.  The corned beef is piled on as well.  Simply delicious.  The Loki (pronounced low key) is also ridiculously good!!!  The combination of provolone cheese, the sweet and slightly tangy picked red onions, spicy jalapenos, the meaty and the heartiness of the corned beef, and the depth of the horseradish and dill mayo on that grilled/toasted rye bread works to perfection.  The Prosciutto Mozzarella Melt with provolone, tomato, basil, balsamic vinaigrette on sourdough is also a solid pick.  Boy do they pile on the prosciutto.  One thing that throws me off about the sandwich is that they actually don't put mozzarella in it, but you won't miss it once you take a bite.  The decor is not the greatest, but it fits the restaurant's eclectic/bohemianesc personality.  Red and orange walls subtlety clash, but in a unique way it works.  Neon beer signs lines one of the red walls, a slowly rotating art exhibit for local artists fill one of the other orange walls, which adds a nice touch.  This place is not your typical Scottsdale place.  No glitz, glamour or pretentiousness about this place.  It's just a neighborhood diner/restaurant, where you will see your regulars, the wait staff hanging on their days off and oh yea, just plain good unpretentious food, just like the decor and patron.  Well the patrons are unpretentious...most of the time.  FYI, the sandwiches are huge.  4 1/2 Stars

The name says it all.  This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.  Cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a "torta" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.   The other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).  The Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.  The Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.  As I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).  The pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.  The burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.  I used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.  For example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least.   Another example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).  The best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.  Overall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late.

Alas, my craving for Indian food came to the point where I had to breakdown and eat Indian food on the West Coast. :(  I'm sorry to say that my craving for Indian was not met and the "timing" to eat at "Tandoori Times" couldn't have been worse.  To start off my first sign of disappointment was when I called to see if the had a lunch buffet  They didn't.  What Indian Restaurant doesn't do a lunch buffet!?  Well two to be in exact, which happens to be the only two Indian restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale (Tandoori Times and Jewel of the Crown) which is where I work, of course.  The cuisine...  First off, I'm a big believer that you can judge an Indian restaurant by their chicken tikka masala, so since this was my first visit to Tandoori, I had to try it.   Let's just say it was okay at best.  The tikka masala was little bit spicier than usual, which is fine with me, and it also had the right consistency and richness from the cream you expect, but it missed the slight sweetness that contrasts the spices from the sauce.  Disappointing.  Next was the naan.  The naan came out warm and had that ever so slight crispy outside that I adore, but the inside was slightly doughy or little too moist, which made the naan slightly chewy after it cooled off.  It was still good, but come on; you can at least master the basics right?  Wrong.  Let's go to the rice.  First and foremost I don't ever recall where you had to pay for rice at any Indian restaurant.  Well guess what?  I did.  $2.50 to be exact!!!  And for $2.50, did they master this staple side dish?  Noooo...  It wasn't like it was horrible but I have never had Indian rice that was oily; it was slight, but you could taste and feel it.  Overall texture and flavor was sub par, but I couldn't get over the slightly oily taste and texture.  All I could think was that I was eating Chinese fried rice (b/c of the oiliness) with my tikka masala.  Sigh... Oh well.  Atleast they gave a hearty portion.  Decor was adequate, dark green and red colored sheer covered sections of walls and was used a divider to break up the room.  But what was up with the standard white office acoustical tiles in the ceiling?  Atleast black it out like most restaurants.  I felt like I was at work or in some weird episode of The Office.  An episode when Steve Carell's character, Michael, decides to go to an Indian restaurant at lunch and notices the same thing...but to only make an erroneous comment out loud so everyone in the restaurant could here, starts mocking Indians and their accent and everything then goes down hill: something I would only laugh if on TV, but would not in real life.  I couldn't get over the fact that on top of that they had the audacity to then painted random acoustical tiles dark red and blue, which made your eyes look up at the ceiling.  I'm clueless on that one.  Anyways, I am very hard pressed to find a reason to go back Tandoori Times.  For all you Phoenicians you never had Indian Food, save your taste buds and go to NYC or anywhere back east and try it there.  But if you get the urge, I would suggest go to India Delhi Palace on McDowell Road.  The food is actually pretty good, for AZ standards that is.  More along the lines of 2 1/2 Stars
