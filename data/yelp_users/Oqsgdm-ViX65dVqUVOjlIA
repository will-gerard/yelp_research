I love this place. Been going here for years. Always had great service and my dogs are clean and perfect. Every time on time. Plus I know that the owners love all the animals!

Mmmm nothing better than a late night Filly-B run! Had three shredded beef tacos. High Quality with all of the ingredients that you love is what you get here!   I know they are bad for me but they taste so good..nom..nom..nom..

Never had Thai food before but I love it now! Enjoyed the PadThai very much and anxious to get back and experiment with the menu. Good value.

Found this using Yelp today and I am so glad I did.   Had lunch with a friend and Queen's was everything they advertised themselves to be.  Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly and informative. I really like the open floor plan and the brick walls. Artwork was nice, but the seating could be a little more comfortable.   Ordered Bruschetta while I was waiting for my friend and it was great! Bread was just thick enough so that it did not overpower the toppings. Very fresh ingredients and the taste was some of the best I have had, very nice.   After speaking to one of the owners we ordered a meatball pizza (Vegas?) and it came to our table piping hot. Crust makes a pizza and this crust was good, but not great. It was cooked correctly but it was a little floury for my taste. Sauce was spicy, not sweet which is what I like.  The meatballs were cut into smaller pieces and were spicy and good, not greasy or overdone. Overall a good but not great pizza. I will definitely come back ! Note: Very cool place to hang out and get some work done as well. We stayed for several hours after we had eaten.  TIP: Park in back.

Ahh BJ's... 6 months ago you were one of my favorites in the East Valley. Now, not so much. In fact, I may never go back.  Always enjoyed the atmosphere which has not changed, usually the wait staff is competant, but the food was always great.  Good portions and quality ingredients, but not anymore.  Server was very mechanical and short. Since others bring the food, what else dies she have to do except check on us and keep our drinks filled? Sad. We ordered the Italian Market Salad which we usually split. It used to be a very finely chopped mountain of lettuce with great veggies, Garbanzo beans, cheese, meat etc. Now it has a small handful of white, droopy iceberg lettuce, tons of dressing and lots of white cheese balls. I could not finish my half (I was starving buy it was too gross) so we quickly paid and left. At this point even Taco Bell or Chipotle sounded good!   So sad..

I do not get many massages, but that is going to have to change. This place is truly amazing. Not only was the massage first class, but the masseuse found every trouble spot I had and worked out every knot I had. I feel fantastic! Highly recommend!

Just had the full rack of ribs, Louisiana style. Very tasty. Everything including the service is great here. If you love ribs, you gotta get down here!

Pros: -------- Great selection of unique sandwiches and some of the old favorites. Companion had the SlawBeJo - an amazing combination of sliced beef, coleslaw and cheese with Russian Dressing. I had an amazing Grilled Italian sandwich. All the great Italian meats GRILLED and I added some sweet peppers! Mmm....nom nom nom... Great portions. 12" sandwich was plenty for me, they do not skimp on meat.  I think that Firehouse Subs down the block better look out this places BLOWS them away.   Cons: -------- No sandwich combos (a side and a drink).  Need to add wi-fi.

Thai Patio has great food at reasonable prices. I am no Thai expert, but everything I have ordered .at Thai Patio has been delicious. I have had the Tom Yum (hot and spicy) soup, the #27 (sorry cant pronounce of spell it ) is amazing and the Pad Thai is very good.   Prices are fixed @$6.95 for lunch for main course, small egg roll, salad and a drink! Dinner has fixed prices as well (seafood is a little extra) @ $8.95 per entree.  Service is very good and the food is always made fresh and is piping hot!

Just tried this very new place in downtown Mesa. If I had to sum it up in one word, I would say it was great. I would also add that this is another great place on main street that I have tried. Go to downtown Mesa, there are some great places! Support your locals!  Anyway on with the review...  Service was very friendly and informative. Since we had never been there before we had a lot of questions and the staff patiently answered them all. The staff refilled our drinks and delivered our food and picked up our empties! Definitely not your average picnic!  My wife had the Pressed Roast Beef and she loved it. She was willing to give me a bite and I concur. Creamy horseradish, lettuce, lots of roast beef and provolone cheese on a crispy baguette. Yum. I had the Prosciutto and Fix Jam, sounds weird but tastes great! Light on the fig jam, but everything else was so good too.  Plenty of food on both sandwiches you will not go away hungry!  I have to say that the highlight of my meal was the blue cheese coleslaw. Next time just give me a quart of that spicy, blue cheese goodness and a fork!  Atmosphere is nice and comfy, even if it is a little small. Hey it's new! Squeeze into this place for a great sandwich and side, you will not be disappointed!

I love this place. I have been coming here regularly for the past few years. Service is always good. The place is clean and the food is made from scratch, no microwaves. Love the look of the place and the beer is always cold and a great selection.   I have been to Ireland and The Harp is very authentic !   To those that rated this place so low, I challenge you to give it another chance.   Do not miss this place if you are in the area.

Been coming to Dr. Nielson for about 6 months. Had a cleaning, root canal and a crown down by him.  He is very attentive to your needs and constantly making sure you are as comfortable as you cannot be.  The staff is professional and my appointments have been on time and efficient. You will not sit for 30 minutes all by yourself wondering where the Dentist is, they are constantly checking on you.  Finally, love the layout of this place. You will not be shuffled off to a series of little rooms. There are walls between patients but the design is open.  Highly recommend giving Spectrum Smiles a try!

World of Beer? Should be world of poor service. Went there at 4pm on a Friday, sat at the bar and waited and waited. Finally after literally 15 minutes trying to flag one of FOUR bartenders , we left. There are plenty of places to go..So sad because I had just been there a few nights before and had great service and tried a new beer. It wasn't really that busy, I dont understand it.  We will give it one more try...

Had the sampler and loved the Red Mountain Ale and the Dunkel Weizen but I am partial to amber beers. Great to have a brewery on Main St. in Mesa !

The reviews of this place don't do it justice. The lighting is a problem? You expected better sushi? C'mon people this is sushi in Gilbert!! Go to Scottsdale and spend 3 times as much.  This place is great for a quick lunch or dinner. Clean, fresh sushi in a fun environment. Great value for the money. Do yourself a favor, have a meal here you will not be disappointed.
