What can I say that 44 other reviews haven't said.   I first found Sakana when I lived within walking distance of the small eatery. It wasn't until I moved 10 miles away did I start eating there.   My first time I ate there was almost two years ago. I remember being surprised that there was a line outside. From my limited experience with amazing, line-worthy restaurants this, typically meant a good thing. Long story short, I wasn't disappointed.  Sakana is a small sushi bar and restaurant tucked away at the end of a large strip mall. Its rather easy to miss the first time you drive by. I have always been impressed that the sushi chefs are Asian (I'm sorry but I always have found irony in how other ethnicity's cook and prepare another ethnicity's food. I'm not German, I'm not going to pretend I can cook German food well - Italian, well, that's another story... moving on). The place can seat about 10 people at the bar, another 50-60 people at tables and despite the amount of people the place can hold it's rather comfortable. The lighting is dim, the music is not intrusive and unless it's a Friday or Saturday its very easy to hear the group you're with even when it spans 2 or 3 tables.  Except for spring rolls (which are totally fabulous) I haven't ordered anything besides sushi & salmon nigiri. This is hands-down the best sushi I have had in Arizona. The fish does not taste like that terrible fishy flavor that makes you wonder if it's fresh or if you'll end up sick the next day, it has the flavor of the fish you are meant to be eating. The nori is rarely ever bitter, salty, chewy or pungent. Only a handful of times out of the dozen that I have been there have I ever been disappointed in the flavor, texture or presentation of the roll.  Personally I get the same thing every time I go. A Philidelphia roll and an avocado roll inside out (I like my rice outside the nori, thank you). They're my favorite and 9 times out of 10 perfectly made. It's pretty fabulous that the roll pretty much never falls apart which irks me at other places to no end. The salmon is well flavored and very smooth - it practically melts in your mouth.  Other sources (some being people that I have converted to Sakana Groupies) tell me that the soft-shell crab roll is amazing. Their spicy tuna is fabulous (again doesn't taste like over powering canned tuna) and their eel roll has a surprisingly light taste, it's not as heavy or chewy as I would have thought. Order some rolls, snag some hot green tea (or some chilled cranberry sake) and appreciate some really great sushi rolls. I could do a whole review on just one roll alone...  Beyond their rolls their nigiri (a piece of fish over a bed of rice) is great. Dab some wasabi on it, dip it in some soy and enjoy. A good friend of mine orders nothing but their nigiri - seriously they ordered about 16 pieces. If they have Toro on their list of sashimi, get some. You will not be disappointed..  Other people have mentioned their amazing specials. They're open for lunch now and you can easily get out of there for about 8 bucks (1 or 2 rolls and water to drink). They have a great selection on their Customer Appreciation list (has about 8-12 rolls on there) and offer every evening at least one different dinner special in addition to the 5-10 specials they're offering that night. On the other hand, with a large enough party, you can also end up leaving with a tab in the hundreds. But it's worth it.   If it's only you or you're there with a small group (2 or 3) sit at the bar. You learn some pretty awesome things about preparation and some insider sushi secrets sitting at the bar chatting with the sushi chefs :)   Let me know if you want to go... I don't pass up a trip to Sakana :D

A large group of us, 20 to 25 + people showed up a few nights ago.   Half Moon is surprisingly large. As another poster said there are hidden rooms and lounge areas off nearly every dining area. Fortunately it's easy enough to find your way around. Lighting was dim. Music was a little loud though; I don't think the sound on the TVs were even on. Even when people were in there for the game (which was that evening) it wasn't overly noisy. It was though hard to hear one another in our room which surprised me as our room separated us from the rest of the restaurant.  They have a good beer selection and beer-food. I had a simple appetizer, the burgers my friends had smelled delicious (bbq sauce, cheese and bacon, yum!) and the wings looked decent enough but a lot of the food seemed over priced to me. $4.50 for edamame in a bowl similar in size to a Like It from Cold Stone....  Also, while their bathrooms were great looking (very clean which is always nice) I was extremely surprised that none of the stalls had a hook for a purse of a jacket. I'm glad I left my purse at my table, I'm not a fan of sitting it on a public bathroom floor but I had to throw my jacket over the stalls door and while that doesn't bother me greatly, I'd much rather have it hanging in my stall.  I've been to better sports grills (Goldies, Fox, Zipps) but I've been to worse.

Salon Izzy might not be a swanky or posh NYC or Beverly Hills salon but it is typical and fast paced filled with a dozen of different stylists that are always, always busy.   After having an insane thought of going to someone else and resulting in hair suicide, I became a monostylist. I followed my stylist, Melody, there from a salon up the street and to be honest I'm not there for the salon, I'm there for her.   The lady is crazy busy but she is so worth it. The first time I saw her, 3ish years ago, I was in desperate need of a new style. Problem was my hair was pixie cut and there wasn't much I could do but she grinned and did her best.   Melody is bubbly and outgoing, but patient and particular when it comes to hair. She always tells me that she has this "vision" of what she wants my hair to look like. I strayed from it, regretted it and when we adjusted the overall look that I wanted to fit her vision... well, I haven't been happier with my hair in a very, very long time. When she's done cutting she goes over nearly every inch of your head, tilting it one way then another while tugging on your locks to make sure everything is symmetrical.  Melody also colors hair and I've been getting my hair colored for probably 2 and a half years. I insisted that she did it in such a way that it looked 100% completely natural - none of that skunk coloring, or zebra stripes, or duo-tone. I was very wary and it's been fabulous - I don't get compliments on my color and I'm OK with that! I've got the highlights I want with the glow and shine without it being noticeable!  Oh, if you tell her you want a look and she pauses for a moment with a dubious look on her face, that's basically your cue to say, "Not on my head?" and she'll either tell you no, or recommend a way to make it work for your head. She has never put a style on someone that wouldn't compliment their body and face shape.  If you're in the area she's worth the visit and if you're not in the area... well, she's still worth the visit.

I've only been there once but I dug the hole in the wall feel, the very dim lighting, ever changing music (from soft rock and jazz to salsa and brass), copper floors, candelabras and the swanky bathroom.   But, the bathroom was really the only part that was posh. New pedestal sink, mirrors of varying sizes on multiple walls, cubbies and a couch that could seat 3 women. Yes, a couch. In a one person bathroom.  I had a beer, which is a typical choice for me, but I didn't see anything on the menu that I wouldn't be able to get in a pub, large brew house or a restaurant that has dozens of choices. I didn't order any food and unlike other reviewers my table had fast and friendly service, but then one of my table mates knew the bartender/owner so I think that helped.  I think something that inhibits this place from being a larger local hang out is there is barely any parking (only two spots out front) and the place can hold probably 15 people? If you're looking for a small and quiet place to go this would be it, but if you're a group larger than four I'd recommend going somewhere else.
