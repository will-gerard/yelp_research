Went here last night for the Suns vs. Clippers game and had a blast.  I've been here  for a concert and other games, and have always enjoyed each outing.  Although not as big as the Staples Center in LA, it's a decent size...feels more "intimate", if such can be described of a stadium full of people.   Parking next to the stadium was $15, but as my friends and I had drinks and appetizers at Thai'd Up before the game, we left our cars parked at Central/Adams, which was less than three blocks from the stadium (free meter parking after 5pm).    The stadium was clean, brightly lit, and security was everywhere - so we felt safe.  During the three hour game, our group of six grabbed some pizzas and wings to share -  and some Patron margaritas (about $8 each).    The game last night was awesome - such a close game, with the Suns ultimately winning by three points.

Went here with the Supper Club in September for a 6:30pm dinner. This is now one of my fave restaurants.  Since this place doesn't serve alcohol but offers a BYOL option, one of the gals brought two bottles of white wine for our dinner. ($10 corking fee)  We started off with the Brie brulee ($12), which was warmed and served with a side of caramelized apples, toast, a sliced pear, a strawberry, and grapes. I could have eaten a plate of this and called it a meal; simple, but so delicious!  We ordered three entrees, the Alaskan halibut ($34), lamb shank ($24), and the pork tenderloin ($26). The halibut sat on a bed of mashed potatoes and was topped with a roasted red pepper sauce and shrimp - and was served with grilled vegetables. The fish was flaky, light, and tasted like heaven. The pork tenderloin was cooked and seasoned perfectly - very moist! I'm not a fan of lamb dishes, but the lamb shank was pretty flavorful - and not gamey as I expected it to be.   We usually skip dessert, but decided to try the chocolate torte (flourless). The torte was topped with fresh vanilla ice cream, a side of chocolate drizzle and raspberries - loved the mint used as decoration.   Our waitress was very attentive and made us feel at ease. The owner came by to talk to us and took some pics for us, before and after our dinner. The ambiance of this place is AMAZING - very European. There is even outdoor seating.

Was in the Chandler area three weeks ago and decided to stop by this place to pick up some dinner on my way home.  I ordered the General Tso's Chicken ($9.95), Beef Chow Fun ($7.25), Eggplant in Garlic Sauce ($6.50), and Chicken Fried Rice ($6.50).    The food took forever to get ready, but boy, it was worth the wait since it was delicious!!!  For such reasonable prices, the portions were huge and the quality/taste of the dishes was a nice surprise.  My mom is picky when it comes to restaurant food, but she LOVED the chow fun.  The menu looks pretty extensive, with reasonable prices.  If you're looking for ambiance, this isn't the place.  However, for a casual dine-in experience or takeout, this place will hit the spot.    Their lunch menu items are nicely priced too...ranging from $4.50 to $5.75.  Looks like they're open 7 days a week, from 10:30am-10:30pm.    Too bad I now live in Tempe, otherwise I would stop by more often.

I've not stayed at this resort, but have been here twice; once for a wedding and the other for a Lunch & Learn event.  Valet service each time was quick and the guys were professional and pleasant.  The grounds of the resort are kept meticulously clean and there were clear skies and greenery everywhere I looked; so beautiful.  Lunch & Learn (Aug 18th):  The event started a little past noon and ended a little past 3pm.  We reserved for six, but it's based on a first come, first served basis.  Two of us arrived a little after 11:30am and after paying our respective $75 fee, went to find a table that would afford us good views of the chef's station.  Unfortunately the best tables (with direct views of the chef's station) had "Reserved" placards on them, so we ended up with one off to the right of the chef's station.  I would recommend arriving early to grab good seats; tables are set for ten.  There are two large TV screens in the room, in case you're not able to see the chef directly.    Our event was hosted by Chef MacMillan (gave the guests a few good laughs), with featured guest chef Kevin Binkley (owner of Binkley's Restaurant in Cave Creek).  The servers weren't obtrusive and kept our water and wine glasses full.    We started off with a glass of champagne, which wasn't great, but was appreciated and added to the festive ambiance.  For this event, we were served three courses:  an appetizer (chilled cucumber soup), entrée (two-wash ranch chicken), and dessert (huckleberry semi-fredo).  Each course was paired with a different glass of wine:  John Anthony Sauvignon Blanc (white, appetizer), Andre Brunel Cote du Rhone (red, entrée), and Pietro Rinaldi Moscato d'asti (dessert).  I'm not usually a fan of Sauvignon Blanc (I favor Riesling), but the John Anthony won me over.    Chef Binkley went over his background and demonstrated the process that goes with making the chilled cucumber soup (which is quite involved).  The soup, albeit a bit salty, was SO good.  Everyone raved about it, and the best part of the dish for me was the charred red onion.  The two-wash ranch chicken entrée was good overall; however, my chicken was a bit dry and tough to cut.  This might be a one-off thing since others at the table said their chicken was moist.  Loved the sweet potato puree and Chantrell mushrooms.  The only real complaint I had was the lack of a demo for the entree and dessert.  With that said, I can understand why the chef needed to be in the kitchen...after all, we needed to eat, right? ;P  Other highlights: *  Live band entertained with great hits (a bit loud though for lunchtime) *  Recipes to take home *  Q & A with the chef (and photo ops) *  Raffles for a few prizes, which two of my friends won (a gift box of caramel brownies and one-night stay at the Sanctuary with dinner)  Wedding (Friday, March 23rd):  The ceremony was held at 5pm on the grounds near the ballroom.  The weather was a bit warm, but not unbearably so.  The bride and groom were beautiful (so was the service), but it was a bit distracting to see people observing us from the windows of the Jade Bar, which overlooked the grounds where the ceremony was held.  After the ceremony, we took a short hike up the stairs for cocktail hour, held just outside the ballroom.  It was such a beautiful experience to have a glass of wine, nibble on hors d'oeuvres, chat with friends, and watch the sun go down (with the mountains as a backdrop).  The reception was held in the ballroom and was decorated beautifully.  The food was great, the wine and alcohol was flowing, and the live (Latin) band made for a great evening.  My friend used Sanctuary's wedding planner (and caterer) and they did a great job.

So glad I decided to stopy by Khai Hoan last week.  I recently moved back to AZ from L.A. and was on the prowl for a Vietnamese restaurant.    Service was quick and our food arrived within 15 minutes of our entering their establishment.  My daughter and I ordered the same item (pho with beef meatballs / $5.25 each) and Thai iced tea ($2.50 each).    The pho broth was so flavorful and fragrant!  I normally cannot finish a bowl of pho, but this time around, I piled on the veggies and inhaled the pho within 5 minutes LOL  The place is open 6 days a week, from 9am-9pm (closed Sundays).  The menu has a mix of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes, with prices ranging from $6.25 to $7.85 for their entrees.    I look forward to returning soon to try their goi cuon (spring rolls / $3.25), cha gio (fried egg rolls / $6.25), and the com tam dac biet (pork chop, beef, shredded pork, and steamed egg meatloaf over rice / $7.50).    I'm spoiled with the diversity and quality of restaurants in L.A., so I'm hunting around the PHX metro area to find quality Asian restaurants.    Anyone know of any Malaysian restaurants in the PHX metro area?

Based on rave reviews from other Yelpers, I went to Caffe Boa with high expectations.  Alas, my experience there was a bit of a disappointment due to said high expectations.    My sister and I had a reservation for an early dinner (5pm) yesterday and after lucking out on a parking spot right in front (coin-operated meter); we were seated pretty quickly by the (unsmiling) hostess.  At this time, we were probably the third occupied table in the restaurant.    The décor and vibe featured a modern and elegant main dining room on the inside and an intimate patio area decorated with intertwining vines and bursts of colors from flowers.  The restaurant began to fill up by 6pm and consisted mostly of casual to business-casual middle-aged folks.    I started off with a glass of their Pinot Grigio ($7) and found it to be very smooth and strong.  The Brushetta ($10) consisted of huge slices of Ciabatta bread, topped with slices olives, capers, chunks of tomatoes, and slices of basil.  This was my fave dish of the night as it was so full of flavor (albeit a bit chunky in texture).  We tried eating this as daintily as we could but ended up making a big mess.     I was wavering between trying the Agnolotti (grilled forest mushroom ravioli) or the Autumn Maccaroncello (butternut squash with wild honey sauce and goat cheese pasta) and opted for the Maccaroncello ($17) since I was intrigued by the combination of ingredients.  When the waiter brought the dish over, my belly did a happy flip since it looked and smelled delicious.  I took the first bite and although the initial taste was packed full of butternut squash and cheese flavor, I was a bit taken aback by the saltiness of the sauce and the "too al dente" texture of the pasta.  I drank a sip of water to cleanse my palate and tried another bite...with the same result!  Being an optimist (when it comes to food), I drank a sip of the wine and tried another bite...same darn result!  Sigh, sigh, sigh!  At this point I felt full and so settled back to watch my sister pick at her dish...read below.   My sister initially chose the Toasted Herb Gnocchi (milk braised Dutch Valley veal sweetbreads in gravy) but after being told by the waiter that the sweetbreads won't be ready for consumption for who knows how long, she opted for the Mezzaluna Ravioli ($16 / pork stuffed ravioli in broth).  When the waiter brought her plate over, I almost choked on my glass of wine.  The darned dish looked just like a bowl of steamed wontons in broth that one can find at a Chinese restaurant! My sister said it tasted just like wontons too and offered me a bite...which I declined.    Although we wanted to try the tiramisu, we opted out of that due to our disappointment in our dishes.    Our waiter provided very good service and seemed eager to please. Caffe Boa's website boasts that their menu consists of Mediterranean, Slavic, Asian, and Cajun preparation and states that they focus on using seasonally inspired, all natural, organic ingredients.  I agree that their ingredients seemed fresh and I did taste the Asian influence in the dishes; however, the effort fell short of my expectations.  I admire the chef for his innovation though, and will have to give this restaurant another try before I completely give up on them.    Overall, for one glass of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees, our bill came to approximately $50 (before tip).

The  Wynn is a very upscale hotel.  I like that the casino and public areas are more quiet and relaxed than other hotels on the strip. This is probably due to the Wynn not allowing strollers inside the hotel and due to the fact that they don't offer touristy attractions like other hotels on the strip.  Also, the casino floor is less smoky and crowded.    If you want an upscale hotel, but yet want to be where the action and noise is, then you're better off at the Palazzo or Venetian.  When we walked from the Wynn and through the Palazzo to get to the Venetian for dinner at Tao, it was obvious the atmosphere changed from relaxed at the Wynn to the usual Vegas hotel noise at the other two.    CHECK-IN: Upon check-in, you might want to wedge a $20 between your credit card and I.D. and politely ask if there are any complimentary upgrades.   I arrived at the hotel around 1pm and since I booked two rooms, I offered a $50 instead of a $20.  The front-desk clerk saw the $50, smiled, said "thank you" and "let me see what I can do for you".  I'm sure he's encountered the "complimentary upgrade tip" before.     Since I booked our resort rooms on Hotwire.com and got a rate of $135/night, I was more concerned about our request for double bed rooms being honored more than getting complimentary upgrades.  Hotwire only guarantees double occupancy...meaning, you could get stuck with one bed.    Anyhow, the clerk gave me two options: 1)  Two connecting rooms on the 19th floor, each with double beds and views of their massive golf-course.  Or,  2) Two rooms on the 51st floor, three doors away from each other, each with double beds and views of the strip.    For both options, only one room was ready; the other would be ready by 3pm.  Since we preferred to have connecting rooms, we opted for choice # 1.  The clerk took down my cell # so that someone could call me when the second room was ready (which they did later on).  ROOMS: The Wynn website reflected a rate of $289/night for their resort rooms and although I was going to book at that rate, I ended up booking through Hotwire.com for $135/night per a friend's recommendation.  Had I paid full price for the resort rooms ($289/night), I would have been disappointed since for that price, the quality of the room and furnishings are not on par with rooms at the Venetian.  However, since I got the rooms for $135/night, I was satisfied.    I found the rooms to be spacious, with floor to ceiling windows, remote-controlled shades, and big bathrooms.  The décor was sort of blah, considering this is a five-star hotel.  I still prefer the rooms at the Venetian, which are furnished more beautifully and appears more elegant and spacious (probably due to their sunken living rooms).  For those wondering, the Wynn rooms with double beds can sleep up to four comfortably.    Wynn provides some nice toiletries in the bathroom (i.e., citrus/lemongrass smelling lotions, shampoos, and conditioners).  There rooms had an iron, ironing board, safe, refrigerator, and a mini-bar.  As mentioned in other reviews, the mini-bar uses touch-sensor, so if you lift an item out of the basket for more than 30 seconds, consider it yours, no matter that you put it back later.      The TVs located in the main room and bathroom had various music channels to choose from.  It was nice to listen to loud dance/hip hop music to get us in the mood while getting ready for clubbing.    ELEVATOR SECURITY: Although security located near the elevator areas is supposed to check and make sure you have a Red Card (to show you're a hotel guest), not once during our stay were we asked to present our cards.  However, I did notice the guy asking some other people for their cards while we were just waved on through.  Wonder if it had anything to do with how one looks/dresses?    WYNN STAFF: With the exception of one of the front-desk clerks, all staff we encountered was courteous and professional.  The dour front-desk clerk was a British guy in his thirties.  I had to make a second trip to the front-desk to get our room keys for the second room and unfortunately the clerk I checked-in with earlier was no longer there.  The British dude must have expected a tip when I requested our room cards, but I told him we had already checked in earlier.    OVERALL, we enjoyed our stay at the Wynn and would stay here again on future visits.  Basically, the Wynn has everything you would need (nice rooms, great dining, show, shopping, Tryst nightclub) without stepping foot outside the hotel.  However, all things considered, the Venetian is still my favorite hotel in Vegas.

Went here last night for dinner with some friends, and must admit that the food lived up to the hype.  We drove there separately and surprise - now they offer FREE valet parking (of course tip the valet dude).  Our quoted wait time for a table was 1.5 hours, and apparently this was nothing compared to the wait my friends had to deal with before (3+ hours).    We spent time next door at the bar by ordering a bottle of wine and a cheese plate to share and before we knew it, the wait was over.  Although the restaurant isn't big (and we were almost friends with the tables next to us just because it was so snug in there), there was a nice ambiance - especially with the huge woodfire oven in the back.    We ordered two Caprese salads and three pizzas - the Margherita, Wiseguy, and Biancoverde (we added roasted tomato slices to the Biancoverde for an extra charge).  O.M.G. - the food was SO good!  Everything tasted fresh and delicious.  I'm usually not a fan of pizzas with thin crusts, but these were awesome.  Apparently they make their own mozzarella, which is probably why their Caprese salad ($9) is one of the best (if not the best) I've had thus far.  The tomatoes and mozzarella were sliced thick and tasted SO fresh, the basil was fragrant - and EVOO - YUM!   The Magherita pizza was $12 and the other two were $16 each.  Our food came within 15-20 mins after we placed our order, and boy - the pizzas were so fragrant!  They were decently sized and were enough to feed our group of six ladies.  The Margherita and Biancoverde tasted good, but my fave was the Wiseguy, which was topped with thick slices of roasted onions, mozzarella, and thick slices of fennel sausage.  The sausage tasted a bit too sweet, but overall, each bite of the pizza slice was food nirvana.  My friend ordered a Wiseguy to go, so the bill (2 salads + 4 pizzas) came to $88, and we added a 20% tip to that.  Was the food worth the total bill?  Yes!  Will I come here again?  Yes!

Stayed here for two nights in April (Fri the 8th and Sat the 9th).  This was my third stay at the Venetian and it is still my favorite hotel in Las Vegas, followed closely by the Palazzo.  As with the Palazzo, the Venetian is an all-suite hotel - clean, vibrant, busy at all hours, and houses my favorite restaurant, Tao.  We were a group of eleven ladies this trip and two suites were enough to sleep six/five to a room comfortably.  The mini-bar is motion-sensor activated, so be careful about removing items from there...even for a few seconds.    If you're a guest at either the Venetian or Palazzo and want to get on the guestlist for Lavo or Tao Nightclub, just let the front desk know.  If you're having dinner at Tao Restaurant, then I recommend getting a reservation around 9pm or later.  This way, by the time you're done with dinner, the club is open and you can just walk upstairs to the club.    Our dinner reservation was for 10:15 but we weren't seated until 10:30pm.  However, once seated, our food came fairly quickly and we were done with dinner by 11:30pm.  Make dinner reservations as far in advance as possible since 8pm and later time slots are very popular.  If you're a party of ten or more, they'll require a credit card authorization form in order to book your reservation.  Our rate for each room (booked via its website) was:  $199.00/per night $19.04/per night resort fee $23.88/per night room tax ---------------------------------------------------  Total Billed to each Suite = $483.84 (see pic of bill)

Stayed here for two nights in December 2011 (Fri the 2nd & Sat the 3rd). We were a group of ten ladies this trip and two suites were enough for us.  As with prior trips, we dined at Tao on Saturday night before transitioning to the nightclub after dinner. As long as most of the people in your group order an entree, you should be able to get a stamp to enter the nightclub for free. However, I always use a promoter, so we skip the lines and get free admission. The girls and I were offered free VIP seating throughout the night, along with free drinks - so of course it was a great night.  Our rate for each room (booked via its website) was: $160.00/per night $19.04/per night resort fee $19.20/per night room tax ---------------------------------------------------  Total Billed to each Suite = $396.48

Saw "KA" with friends last July and was so blown away by it that I had to return to Vegas last August so I can expose my family to the theatrical wonder that is "KA".  We were a group of six the 2nd time around and sat in section 101, Row O, seats 3-8. Although the seats were good, I would have liked it better had it been seats 10-16, towards the right of the row...and more "central" to the stage. The seats we had for the July show was still in section 101, but Row H, seats 12-16, which was perfect!!!  Music was still as good as I remember, so I had to buy the soundtrack this time around.  My family all liked the show.  I was awed the first time I saw this show and was just a little bit less so during the second viewing.   ***SPOILERS*** I couldn't help but notice that the 2nd time around, the antagonist's dad (The Counselor) was not part of the play, which is too bad since I thought his character was neat and added to the show.  Also, I learned that the production will at times add/remove certain characters.  However, these changes are really minor and will not ruin the show for anyone.  Although I enjoyed all aspects/parts of the show, my favorite (other than the revolving stage - awesome!) was the "Wheel".  You have to see this to believe how incredible it is!!!  This part of the show is very "Cirque du Soleil".  ***END OF SPOILERS***  I have seen "KA", "Zumanity", and "Mystere" and as it stands right now, "KA" is my favorite cirque show.    My family liked Mystere more since there was more of the traditional cirque acrobatics incorporated into the show. Since I love musicals/plays, I prefer KA, which has more of a storyline that was easy to follow.  I found Mystere kind of weird.  I guess I was spoiled because I saw "KA" first and was blown away by the revolving stage (best part of show!), the soundtrack, costumes, and the actors.  I think it will be hard for the other shows in Vegas to upstage "KA", in my opinion.    I'll be catching "Le Reve" at the Wynn early March, so can't wait to see if that will be better than "KA".    DISCOUNTS: During my 2nd viewing of "KA", I got 35% off each ticket through SmarterVegas.com (offered through TicketMaster). The first viewing, we got 25% off each ticket directly through MGM Grand's website.   Always check periodically for Vegas deals through SmarterVegas, TicketMaster, Broadwaybox.com, and/or TravelZoo.com.  If you're still undecided about purchasing tickets to KA, then just wing it until you're in Vegas. The MGM Grand offers up to 35% discounts on the day of the show. The only downside to this is that you are on standby for available seats (not always good ones either), or, you risk not getting to see the show if seats are sold out (as was the case when we saw it Friday night in August).    With the current state of our economy, there just might be more available seats, even if you purchase last minute.  Good luck!  SOUVENIR PHOTOS: Try to get to the show at least 30mins. before start-time.  You'll have the opportunity to get your souvenir photos taken (and to take in the pre-show by some of the main characters).  You'll take a letter/number from the photographer and by the end of the show, your photos will be ready for viewing outside the theater.  Although pricey ($40), I think they are worth it.  The "package" comes with two 5"x7" photos placed inside a black MGM Grand leather photo frame.

My third time seeing KA was on Friday, December 2nd (2011). This time there were four of us and we were seated in Section 103, Row F, Seats 7-10. These seats were pretty close to the stage, so we were able to see the costumes, props, actors, and stage in detail.   I enjoyed it as much during the third viewing as I had the prior viewings. I don't think I can ever get tired of seeing KA. It was also a pleasure to see my friends so enchanted with the show!  This time we got discount seats via travelzoo.com, at a cost of $108.00 per ticket, inclusive of all fees (the regular price was $175 per ticket). We had friends that wanted to buy last minute tickets, but when we called the KA box office, we were quoted full price. When we showed up for our 7:30pm show, there were many empty seats. You'd think KA would provide discounts to fill the theater.  We got drinks from the KA theater bar at $12 each, which were pretty strong and tasty!

I always make it a point to visit Lee's Sandwiches everytime I'm in AZ.  Luckily my family lives in Chandler and just a few blocks from Lee's.    Sandwiches always taste fresh here.  I normally order a few sandwiches for me and the family.  My favorite is the special combo #11.  Others we've tried are the regular Lee's combo #1, grilled pork #5, BBQ pork #6, and their ham & cheese croissant.  You can opt to have the veggies on the side.    They bake their bread onsite, so it always tastes fresh.  The last time I visited AZ, the #11 sandwich was $2+ each, but when I went by today, it was up to $3.05.  Still, that's cheap for a filling sandwich.  The #5 and #6 are $2.85 each.  They have hot food items for sale off to the right of the registers, such as steamed pork buns, which are $1.75 each.  Thai iced teas (no boba) are $2.55 each.   The place is clean and their employees serve you with a smile.    Luckily, there are no Lee's Sandwiches near my house in L.A.; the closest one is about 30 miles.  Otherwise, I would be eating one everyday!    Parking can be hard to find during busy hours, but you can always park at the Walgreens lot next door.

Went here last Friday and enjoyed myself.  This was my third time at Tryst, and thank goodness we've always used a promoter (no lines, no cover).  I can't imagine standing in the long lines waiting to get in.    Anyhow, although Tryst is smaller than XS, Tao, Pure, and some other Vegas clubs, I actually prefer Tryst over the others.  Although Tryst gets quite crowded after midnight, I've always been able to maneuver/dance my way around the club.    My friends and I were able to sit at one of the empty bottle service tables to hang out and rest our feet.    We bought a few rounds of Patron Silver shots and although the cost was $12 per shot, it was well worth the money since it was like getting two shots for that price...the shot glasses were long!    The music was pretty pumping.  Even though the crowd was not diverse enough for me, we still had a great time.  A couple of my girl friends had to be wheelchaired out to a cab, haha.    Tryst is always a good time.  However, I recommend getting a promoter if you want to avoid the hassle of long lines.

We were back here on a Friday night in April and had a great time.  A quick call to the promoter I normally use for Tryst and our group of (all) ladies avoided the long lines and price of admission.  The music was pumping and we ended up at a VIP table with "new friends".  ;-P  Tryst is always a good time for me.  The crowd was a good mix of people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.

We had reservations at Geisha across the street this past Saturday, but since the wait was about 1.5 hours, we ended up at Stingray.  The three of us shared a few dishes, as follows: * house salad ($5) - had a couple of bites, nothing special * beef yakitori (2 skewers / $9) - cooked medium and very tender, but would have been bland without the three sauces on the side  * scallop dynamite ($9) - tried a bite and found the scallops to be overcooked and the sauce too tart * mango tango ($13) - liked the combination of the red eye tuna, chunks of mango, greens, and light sauce (would have been better had the tuna been fresher and chopped into smaller pieces) * sea urchin sashimi ($17) - the serving here is more generous than I've had at other sushi restaurants, and although not the freshest I've tasted, was more than adequate to satisfy my craving * Nabeyaki udon ($19) - good flavor * California roll ($5.50) - I never bother to try this   I tried the Japanese Tease ($9), a drink made with citrus vodka, green tea extract, colpico, and lime juice. This was too sweet, and I barely tasted any vodka (or green tea). Although pretty to look at, definitely not worth the price.   We also shared the green tea tempura ice cream ($7), which came with three pieces - perfect for our group. The others raved about this dessert, but I found it to be nothing special. The batter tasted too pasty, for lack of a better word. I'm also not a fan of green tea, so this may have something to do with my less than enthusiastic reaction.  Our server was Sarah, and although a sweet gal, we didn't see much of her during our time there. Stingray is a nice looking restaurant, but I've had better sushi at Kabuki (Tempe) and at my fave place, Roka Akor (Scottsdale).

The girls and I decided to dine here on Saturday night at 5:15pm.  Yes, we dined that early.  I called to reserve a table for nine a couple of days before we dined, so we got a choice of the 5:15pm or 10:45pm seating.  Since we had to get back to our rooms at Wynn to get ready for clubbing at XS, we opted for the 5:15pm seating.   I loved the Asian décor...muted lighting makes the restaurant appear like an elegant lounge.  Our round table was good for eating family style...and was located right in front of the huge Buddha statue.    Dishes my friends and I tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):  * Edamame (4 stars / $7) - Edamame is edamame...what else can I say?      * Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth (4 stars / $16) - I didn't get a chance to taste this, but my friends loved it.    * Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables (5 stars / $34) - I loved this dish.  So tasty...the fish was so flaky and tender.    * Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant (4 stars / $9) - I kept hearing raves from my friends about this eggplant dish.      * Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Peking Duck (4 stars / $14) - My friends loved this dish, but I thought it was just ok...it could have done with more Peking duck.  As it was, the duck slices were too thin and too few.      * Pad Thai Noodles with Shrimp (4 stars / $22) - Again, my friends raved about this dish, but I found it to be so-so.  I'm picky about Thai dishes, so I expect more.  I have to say I was surprised by the large serving of pad thai since other dishes we ordered came in small servings.   * Giant Fortune Cookie (4 stars / $10) - This fortune cooked is filled with white & dark chocolate mousse.  So pretty to look at...and the filing provided a nice taste and texture to a regular fortune cookie.  Our server also provided nine separate fortunes with our cookie, so that was a nice touch.    * Chocolate Raspberry Wontons (4 stars / $9) - The crisp wontons filled with raspberry filing tasted wonderful with the vanilla bean ice cream.    The wine list had a lot of good options, but we stayed away from alcohol during dinner as we were saving our drinking for our bottle service at XS the same night.  Overall, Tao has great ambiance, good food and great service.  Our server is one of the best I have ever encountered in my years of dining.  He was very patient with our group and answered our questions with a smile.  I would definitely dine here again.

Went here this past Saturday for a friend's birthday dinner.  We were only able to get a 6:45pm spot because we called to make a reservation the day prior to arrival.    I love the dim lighting and overall ambiance of Tao Restaurant.  The place is bit noisy to be a romantic dinner date spot, but it suited our needs for the birthday dinner.  The club music playing in the background pumped us up for later.  We hung out at the lounge while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and took advantage of the photo ops.  This place offers eye candy galore for both men and women...bonus!    Items we ordered:  * Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth ($18) - my friends said this was tasty.  I didn't try any, so can't attest to the taste...although it smelled wonderful.  The wontons were served in a clay pot, simmering gently in it's ginger broth.   * Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34) - this dish was once again very delicious.  The fish was cooked just right...crisp on the outside and flaky on the inside.  The stir-fried veggies and fried tofu pieces rounded out the dish perfectly.    * Crispy Spicy Tuna Roll ($16 / six pieces) - I really enjoyed this roll, which consisted of spicy minced tuna spread thickly on crispy rice cakes (cut into rectangular pieces).    * TAO Angry Dragon Roll with Eel & Kabayaki Sauce ($15 / eight slices) - I enjoyed this roll, but it's just your standard eel roll...nothing special about it.    * Kobe Tartar Tempura ($19 / eight slices) - The minced Kobe beef was wrapped in seaweed, which was then encased in sushi rice and deep fried.  On the side was a bed of marinated, sliced Shiitake mushrooms (which was sweet and delicious).    * Black Pepper Sizzled Filet Mignon with Udon Noodles ($29) - can't say much about this since I didn't get a bite, but it looked and smelled good.  The serving was plentiful, compared with the other dishes.  * Molten Chocolate Cake ($10) - this came with coconut ice cream, but they honored our request for vanilla ice cream instead.    * Assorted Ice Creams and Sorbets ($8) - served with a couple of almond sesame cookies.    Drinks: Glass of Scarbolo Pinot Grigio ($10) / Tao-Tini ($13) / Orange Dragon ($13) /  Bottle of Corona ($8).    For our entertainment, we witnessed this drunk lady that somehow ended up on the lap of the huge Buddha.  She was posing for pics until security escorted her out.  I guess we're not supposed to sit on the Buddha's lap?  Darn!    Another great experience at Tao Restaurant.  I will always make it a point to dine here on every Las Vegas trip.

We had dinner reservations at 10:15pm on Saturday (April 9th) and due to the craziness of it all, our group of ten ladies ended up at two different tables (5/5).  (Our other option was to wait until 11pm to be seated at one table; no thanks!)  Btw, dinner reservations gets you complimentary entry to Tao Nightclub, which is right above the restaurant.  A promoter gave me and my girls bracelets for free drinks upstairs from 10pm-11pm and we managed to get one drink before being seated for dinner.  The food was good as usual (see pics): * Chicken satay with peanut sauce ($10) * Soy ginger-glazed salmon with udon noodles ($26) * Unagi (one for $5) * Uni (one for $8)  May seem like a lot of food, but bear in mind that the portions are very small.  You're paying more for the ambiance, I would say. I also tried their Tao-tini ($13), which was good and strong.  ;-)  Although the initial plan was to dance the night away at Tao Nightclub, our "new friends" from Tryst invited us to Marquee Nightclub at the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  We took them up on the offer since it's the new "IT" club, and we didn't have to wait in line or pay cover.  However, in hindsight, even though we had a good time at Marquee, I wish we had stayed at Tao.

I'm a huge fan of French macaroons and was so excited when I found Essence Bakery!  I was craving the lemon macaroons I normally get when I lived in L.A. and had despaired of finding a bakery in Phoenix that offers these treats.    I've only tried Essence's macaroons and eclairs, so can't attest to their other menu items.  However, their macaroons are TO-DIE-FOR!  (see pics)  Although a bit pricey at $3.25 each (large), I feel the price is worth it as the baking process is a bit complex.  I've tried all the flavors (French chocolate, caramel cream, espresso, raspberry, pumpkin spice, and lemon) and must say my favorites are the the espresso and caramel cream.  The fillings are a bit on the too sweet side, so I usually scrape a bit off.  The macaroons are made up rich and creamy filling sandwiched between dense and chewy almond paste cookies.  Don't mistake these for the coconut-flake based macaroons...not the same thing!    The place is small and seating each time I went was full, but I normally just order to go anyway.  It sucks that Essence Bakery is only open until 3pm Mon-Sat, but maybe it's a blessing in disguise as too much of a good thing will ruin my womanly figure.  ;-P  If you're craving French macaroons and Essence happens to be closed, Trader Joes have mini-macaroons in their frozen food aisle...theirs is also good!  If you want a coffee fix, Starbucks is in the same lot...and there's a drive-thru!

St. Francis, you have a new fan! Went here last night for our monthly Supper Club dinner and enjoyed every minute (we spent a good two hours here).  We reserved a table for nine at 6pm and were seated by 6:15. We ended up with a large table in the corner near the kitchen. The table had a mix of four chairs and two long benches, so that was interesting (table was sort of too high though). Three in our party couldn't make it, but that was a blessing in disguise because it afforded us the chance to spread out and be more comfortable.   The restaurant's design is a mix of modern, trendy and rustic (brick walls and benches) that blended nicely together. Loved the ambient lighting - very cozy and romantic! This is a great place for dinner and drinks with friends (inside) and for a date (patio area).   Our waitress Meschelle was one of the best servers I've encountered at any restaurant. She was very attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the food and drink options; her suggestions were spot on.   To start, we ordered a bottle of the Clean Slate Riesling ($35, a white imported from Germany), the parmesan risotto ($10) and the baked goat cheese ($10). I loved the Riesling - it was light, crisp, slightly sweet, and very smooth. The BCG came out first - the crostini was too hard and the baked goat cheese, pesto and tomato sauce was too tart. The risotto was plated nicely and tasted even better. I loved the caramelized brussel sprouts, cippolini onions and the slices of cajun ham; each bite was lovely. One of the gals said it was cooked too al dente for her, but it was fine to me.   Next we ordered a bottle of the Catena Malbec ($43, a red imported from Argentina). The wine is a beautiful, deep red with a full-bodied, smooth flavor - which went well with my entree (the prime hanger steak, $24, cooked medium well). The others ordered the Moroccan meatballs ($15), pot roast ($19), roasted chicken ($17), and two of the roasted salmon ($22 each). My steak was served on a bed of whipped (mashed) potatoes, veggies (arugula/sliced boiled potatoes/slices of artichoke) and topped off with a red wine sauce. Other than the boiled potatoes being too al dente, my entree was SO GOOD. (I think the steak would have tasted better if I had it cooked medium.) I tried a bite of the Moroccan meatball, pot roast, and roasted chicken; all tasted great! The pot roast was so tender and full of flavor; the best pot roast I've tasted thus far. This will be my entree of choice when I visit again. Everyone gave the food two thumbs up.  Next we ordered a bottle of the Hullabaloo Zinfandel ($39, a red from Napa Valley). The wine is a beautiful deep red, but too full-bodied for my taste - especially since we're moving on to dessert. I wanted to order the Moscato to go with dessert, but was outvoted - wah, wah. We ordered the chocolate spice cake ($8) and cheesecake in a jar ($8) to share. Although the spice cake was presented beautifully, and was served with maple pumpkin gelato, I was not sold. The initial bite of the cake was full of chocolate flavor, but then the spice hits the palate and it was too strong. However, the cheesecake in a jar was AWESOME! I tried only one bite, but savored each burst of flavor. What made the cheesecake great was the almond crumble.  Our bill came to $297, not inclusive of the 20% gratuity we added to the bill. Not a bad price to pay for great food, great wine and quality time with friends. ;)  Thanks for reading my mini-book Yelpers!

Been here a few times for lunch with co-workers and I am a definite fan.  I've only tried their penne with artichokes/kalamata olives in pink sauce, but the dish has tasted great each time.    During lunchtime, for the price of $9.00, you get a choice of their misto or caesar salad in addition to a lunch portion of the pasta in "pink sauce".  I've added chicken (for an extra $3), but the pasta tasted fine on its own.  The misto salad is also a good size and has always been fresh tasting.  Even though the menu describes the pasta portion as "small", to me it's like a full-sized entree.  Between the fresh bread (free), the salad, and pasta, I've always had leftovers for dinner.    My co-workers have tried the fresh tomato/mozzarella/basil pasta and the mushroom/sausage/pepperoni pizza.  We agree that the quality, taste and portion size of the dishes we've tried warrant repeat visits to Neapolitan.  The service here has been efficient and professional.  (See photos to get an idea of the items we've tried.)

Having recently moved to AZ from L.A., I can't help but be a fan of Sprinkles...memories, memories, memories.  You'll either love 'em or hate 'em.  If you adore cupcakes, you'll love 'em.  If you're a cheapskate, you'll hate 'em because the cupcakes cost $3.50 each.  I've seen Groupon offer deals if you order by the dozen.    As for me, I love 'em as I don't mind paying good money for good food.  I've tried the salted caramel, red velvet, dark chocolate, chocolate marshmallow, and vanilla.  The cupcakes, although not as moist as I'd prefer them to be, are still oh-so-good.  I agree with other Yelpers that they overdo it on the frosting; however, not a big deal as I can always scrape some off if I want it to be less sweet.  So far, the salted caramel is my favorite.

Penang has two locations...one in Las Vegas and one in West Covina, CA.  I discovered the Las Vegas restaurant through a friend a few months ago and since then, I've dined here three times.  Now I make a point to visit Penang when I'm in Las Vegas.  Although it's off the strip, the drive is worth it to get some good Malaysian food.    Malaysian cuisine is a mix of Chinese, Thai, and Indian dishes, and is very flavorful, spicy, and fragrant. Three great cuisines combined into one...how can you go wrong?   Dishes I've tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):  * Roti Canai (4 stars / $3.25) - have ordered this each time and always one of my favorites.  This is basically Malaysian chicken curry served with a flaky Indian-style pancake.  This appetizer is small (one small bowl of curry and one large flaky pancake), but still enough to share between two people.      * Penang Satay...beef and chicken (4 stars / about $6 for five sticks) - Others have mentioned that these run a little spicy, but the marinade makes the satay so tasty!  I like spicy, so I had no complaints.  I normally don't need the peanut sauce that comes with this appetizer.    * Curry Puffs (3 stars / $5.50 for four small puffs) - These were decent, but nothing special.  The puffs were filled with a curried potato and chicken mix.  I found the curry a bit overwhelming and the puffs too spicy...for a pastry.  A more subtle flavor would have worked better.  ;-X    * Penang Char Kway Teow (4 stars / $7) - This is a dish containing stir fried flat noodles with shrimp, squid, bean sprouts, eggs, soy sauce, and chili paste.  Although good, I wasn't wowed by the dish.  However, to be fair, I am comparing it to the most awesome Char Kway Teow served by street stall vendors in Penang, Malaysia; I ordered this street stall food almost every day while there.    * Mee Goreng (4 stars / $7) - This is an Indian-style egg noodle dish stir fried with dried squid sauce, tofu, potatoes, shrimp, egg, and bean sprouts.  I ate this after a hangover, and from what I remember, tasted pretty good.    * Hainanese Chicken (half -- 4 stars / $10) - This is one of my favorites.  The dish comes with flavored rice that comes with steamed chicken, accompanied by broth, soy sauce, and minced ginger.  Simple but oh so yummy!  * Kang Kung Belacan (5 stars / $10) - I always order this at both Penang locations and it's my favorite dish. The Kang Kung (or Chinese On Choy) is sautéed with this yummy, spicy Malaysian shrimp paste sauce.  I can eat just this alone with rice!  This dish is also easy to make at home.  The $10 cost is a bit pricey for just sautéed veggies, but oh well...I can't help myself!    PROS: - Cheap prices for great food - Food served reasonably quickly - Plenty of parking in this strip mall area - Menus have pictures on them, to assist those that aren't familiar with Malaysian cuisine  CONS: - After you get your food, follow-up service can be spotty - Restaurant is located on second floor of a strip mall (ok, so I get lazy to go down the stairs after my belly is full...the elevator takes FOREVER)  This is Malaysian food, so most dishes come spicy.  Between the Las Vegas and West Covina locations, I find that the dishes at the Las Vegas location had more flavor and tasted more authentic.

Stayed here this past weekend (Nov 20th-22nd) and Palazzo did not disappoint.  This all-suite hotel is very clean, less noisy than the Venetian, and feels more elegant.   l love the Venetian, but the Palazzo offers a more relaxed getaway.    We booked the Palazzo Bella Suite (2 Queen Beds), and felt that it was more than adequate for our group of five gals.  I slipped the young lady at the fronk desk a $20 upon check-in and politely asked her for a complimentary upgrade.  She upgraded us to a strip-view room, along with some passes to Tao and Lavo.    There were two to a bed and the fifth gal slept on the L-shaped couch in the sunken living room.  We could have turned the couch into a sleeper but found that it was more comfortable just sleeping on the actual couch.    Security always made sure to ask everyone to show their room card before being allowed to enter into the elevator area...nice!  I usually spot hooker-type gals trying to enter the elevator areas on prior Vegas trips, but didn't notice this during our stay here.  The mini-bar is motion-sensor activated, so be careful about removing items from there...even for a few seconds.    Breakdown of room service order:   - tuna sandwich on multi-grain bread, with fries ($15) - delivery charge ($4) - 18% service charge ($2.70) - tax ($1.54) --------------------------------------------- Total = $23.24 (+ whatever tip you want to add to the bill)  If you're craving a caffeine fix, you won't have to walk far since there's a Coffee Bean situated right by the elevator area.  Of course prices are inflated...a regular iced tea cost me $5+.  There's a Walgreen's attached to the Palazzo if you need to buy much needed items for next-day hangovers...like Tylenol, bottled water, juice, etc...  Just take a left when you exit the Lobby doors and follow the walkway to Walgreen's.    If you're staying at the Palazzo and want to get on the guestlist for Lavo or Tao Nightclub, just let the front desk know.  We were able to get on the guestlist for partying at Tao on Saturday night.  A word to the wise though...even if you're on the guestlist, you still have to wait in one of the LONG-A$$ed lines!  I normally use a promoter and skip the lines, but didn't this time.    If you're having dinner at Tao Restaurant, then I recommend getting a reservation around 9pm or later.  This way, by the time you're done with dinner, the club is open and you can just walk on up to the second floor to party.  Unfortunately, we were only able to get on their 6:45pm slot for dinner (we booked the day prior to arrival).  Note:  make dinner reservations as far in advance as possible since 8pm and later time slots are very popular.  Cab from the airport to Palazzo (and vice versa) ran us $18 each way...plus whatever tip you want to give the driver.  One of my friends had to leave early to the airport by herself and was charged $28 for the one-way cab ride!  She was told by the driver that he had to take a shortcut via the freeway, so that's why it's $10 extra.  That's bullcrap because our driver took the freeway to the airport and we were only charged $18.

Went here for dinner last Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday. Being that our group was large (18) and the private dining room was already booked, we were seated in the patio area. (Luckily the weather was nice around 8p.m.) Roka Akor is a beautiful restaurant, from the inside out.  I ordered the Unagi ($8.50), Uni sashimi ($13.00), Yellowtail sashimi ($8.00), and two of their blood orange margaritas ($10 each). When they brought out my order, all I could think was "wow!" (See pics)  The Unagi (freshwater eel), Uni (sea urchin) and Yellowtail looked and tasted fresh - the Uni melted in my mouth (yum).   The blood orange margaritas were strong and DELICIOUS and were served in tall glasses (looks sort of like champagne flutes) - the red from the blood orange added a nice pop of color (very elegant looking). The restaurant gets top points for presentation.   This is a great spot for a date, but I wouldn't recommend sitting in the patio area if you're looking for romantic ambiance.  Service is here top-notch, which is very important if one is going to be paying premium prices for food. Our waitress was very knowledgeable, friendly and prompt.   I'd definitely dine here again.  Btw - there is free valet and self-parking.

I've been here a few times with family and friends and have enjoyed the dining experience each time.  Plenty of free parking since it's located within the Tempe Marketplace.  (It's right across the Barnes and Noble Bookstore.)  The most we've had to wait for a table (even on busy Friday and Saturday nights) was 30 minutes.  Even though it was a turnoff when I once overheard waiters discussing the amount of tips they hope to receive from customers, service was professional and efficient overall.   1)  Sea urchin sushi, aka Uni ($7.50 for two pieces) - I've had it twice at Kabuki and both times, the Uni has tasted fresh!  Uni is definitely an acquired taste, but man, is it good!  It's an explosion of flavors and textures... at first light and creamy, then sweet, and then briny.  I love having Uni with sake or their lychee martinis ($8.95).  2) Dragon Specialty Roll ($12.95 lunch / $14.95 dinner) - This is my favorite roll at Kabuki.  They are very generous with the eel pieces.  The roll is shaped like a "dragon" and the eel is so delicate it practically melted in my mouth!   3) Paradise Specialty Roll ($10.95 lunch / $12.95 dinner) - This roll is very pretty to look at, and even more delicious to eat!  The roll contains a mix of mango, smoked salmon, cream cheese, and a few other items within the roll.     4) Dynamite ($8.95) - Baked clam, scallop, mushrooms and other veggies in a mayo sauce.  The dynamite served here is just ok.  It was a bit on the salty side and I even tasted a hint of curry powder.    5) Seafood Yaki Soba ($9.95 / lunch) -Soba noodles stir-fried with shrimp/scallop/calamari & veggies in a brown sauce.  The dish had good flavor and the portion was generously sized.

The girls and I decided to dine here on Friday night before our "Le Reve" show at 9:30pm, which is very convenient as Stratta is located right across from the Le Reve theater and a few steps from the resort elevators.  Since we had a heavy lunch, we opted to share appetizers and dinner entrees.  I loved the décor...red walls and muted lighting makes the restaurant appear elegant.    Dishes my friends and I tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):  * Fried Calamari (4 stars / $16) - The calamari was tender and the batter just right...not too crispy.  The crisp-fried slices of onion and parsley added to the texture...the spicy aioli sauce finishes off this appetizer perfectly.        * Roasted Pork Chop with Sage and Garlic (4 stars / $34) - This thick and large porkchop is stuffed with fontina cheese and prosciutto.  I loved the stuffed cheese.  The Asian-inspired sauce was good, but a bit strong, so a side of mashed potatoes or rice would have gone well with it.    * Linguini with Clam Sauce (4 stars / $25) - This dish consisted of roasted clams with garlic, olive oil, white wine, and parsley tossed with linguini.  My friend said the sauce was light and flavorful, and the clams were cooked just right.      * Roasted Shrimp Penne (4 stars / $29) - This dish consisted of a puttanesca sauce with capers, olives, and spicy peppers tossed with penne pasta.  My friends thought the dish was good, but didn't think it warranted the $29 price tag.    * Margherita Wood-Fired Pizza (4 stars / $14) - This pizza consisted of Bel Paese" cheese, tomato and basil.    * Bombolini (3 stars / $10) - Warm amoretti and ricotta beignets (mini donuts) filled with nutella.  The wine list had a lot of good options, but we stayed away from alcohol during dinner and stuck with mineral water and sodas as we were saving our drinking for Tryst.    Overall, Stratta has great ambiance, good food and great service.  Although none of the dishes wowed us, I would definitely dine here again if I'm staying at the Wynn.

Went here in August with the Supper Club for a 6:30pm dinner. This place was hard to find as it's located in a residential area. I passed it several times because the exterior doesn't look like your typical restaurant facade - and there is a school down the block! I must admit, I yelled at my GPS several times for seemingly directing me to the "wrong" place each time "she" said "destination!" - ha! I got a prime parking spot in the small lot next to the restaurant (there is a larger lot across the street).  We were a group of five and were seated in less than 15 minutes. The interior is rustic and for some reason reminded me of a log cabin in Canada - go figure. This is not a large place, so this and the dim lighting added to the rustic and cozy ambiance - a good place for a date.   Our waiter was very attentive and met every need. We ordered two bottles of wine and the following food items: 1) cheese curds; 2) rosemary goat cheese bruschetta; 3) mac and cheese; 4) summer gnocchi; and 5) veal meatloaf.  With the exception of the bruschetta, my impression of everything we tasted was "Wow!" The cheese curds had just the right balance of creaminess from the cheese and saltiness - no sauce needed! The mac and cheese was unlike any I've tasted, not made with typical cheddar but a mix of white cheeses. The veal meatloaf was very flavorful and moist. My fave is the summer gnocchi - I remember thinking this was the best gnocchi I've had thus far. The gnocchi had the appearance of being pan-seared, and the tomatoes and basil really added to the "summer" and fresh taste.  We spent a good two hours here, and although our bill for the food and bottles of wine came to under $100, we paid $150 - our waiter even told us we paid too much! lol A place that provides great food, service and ambiance deserves the extra $$.

I've visited a few clubs on the strip in Vegas (Pure, Tao, Tryst) and so far, XS is my favorite.  Let's just say that for the most part, XS lives up to the hype.  BOTTLE SERVICE: We were there this past Saturday celebrating a couple of birthdays and had booked a table for bottle service through one of the promoters.  Prices for bottles start at $450 (for rum); starting prices for vodka is $460 (for Absolut).  We were a group of nine ladies and our minimum was three bottles (one bottle for every three).  Factor in tax/gratuity and our bill came to $1,800 (or less, if you're going to be cheap on gratuity).  Don't know if bottle prices are lower on less busy nights.    WARNING ABOUT BOTTLE SERVICE SEATING: Ok, so we were led by our host to a tiny table and were told this is our spot for the night for our group of nine.  We were sandwiched in between two other tables.  Since the tables to the right and left of us were already occupied, there were only enough "seats" left to fit four of us.  So, I refused to sit and asked the host to find us another spot as I am paying for three bottles.  I felt that I should be accommodated for our group of nine.    We were told that it was a very busy night and they are filled to capacity.  He tried to get us relocated to a cabana (outside) but was told none was available.  After standing around for a good 20 mins trying to work something out, he said that if we accept the table, he will come and find us later on to relocate us if a larger table opens up.  This was a load of BS I think, but we got tired of arguing and decided to stay, since we wanted to get our party on.     Soon after, the table to our left cleared out, so we took over their seats...providing a chance for my whole group to sit and drink.  An hour later, another party showed up and took that table, but we got lucky again as the party to our right was leaving.  Had both parties stayed, our tiny little area would not have been able to accommodate our group.  This was the only negative aspect out of the whole night.    I felt that XS misrepresented bottle service seating.  The promoter surprised me with a beautiful (and complimentary) birthday cake later on...so that kind of made me forgive the little snafu.  Well, that and the mixed drinks helped to mellow out my mood.  BTW, there was a stripper pole right in front of our table, so my friends were able to take advantage of that and showcase their inner stripper.    If you experience the same runaround we did, just be firm, polite, but STAND YOUR GROUND.  ;-P    PROS: - Beautiful and spacious club - Diverse and good-looking crowd - Great music (mash-up, top 40s, house, hip hop) - Lines for bathroom not as bad as other clubs - Professional, friendly, and good-looking staff - Plenty of stripper poles located throughout the club - For those that opt out of bottle service, you can sit at any table as long as the party hasn't arrived to claim their reserved table; if they never come, you can sit there pretty much all night  CONS: - Bottle service seating experience - Our waitress only came by the table 3-4 times the whole time we were there  - Lines for general admission, guestlist and table reservations are VERY unorganized.  We had bottle service and pretty much had to battle our way to the front of our line to get a host's attention.  Look your best as they will pick and choose who to address based on your looks (which is the case at most clubs in Vegas).    Normal admission is $20 for ladies and $30 for men.  All my girls and I had a great time and agree that XS is definitely worth repeat visits when visiting Vegas.

Ugh...that pretty much sums up my experience at Thai Rama.  I was in AZ visiting family and took my family to eat Thai, expecting Char's to still be there.  When we arrived, saw that name was changed to Thai Rama...no big deal.  Place looked clean and the waitress was friendly.  I ordered my usual Thai dishes: - Pad Thai (weird medicine taste...definitely wrong sauce) - Pork Larb (too sour...not enough fish sauce...not as spicy as I requested) - Pork Rad Nah (sauce tasted too bland...lots of sauce though) - Tom Yum Gung (sigh...I can still remember the disappointment I felt as I tasted this seemingly "canned" soup)  I guess I am used to the authentic Thai food from Chars and Thai restaurants in L.A., so I had high expectations.  It's hard to find a good, authentic Thai restaurant in AZ.  I miss Chars!    Would I go here again?  No.

I had friends visiting from L.A. and booked a night at this hotel on Fri, Feb 10th.  Valet service was quick and efficient, and so was the check-in process.  A couple that was checking in before us asked the clerk if they could upgrade to a suite and were told the hotel was booked to capacity, so upgrades weren't an option.  We later learned that there was a Boyz II Men concert that weekend, so hence the "booked to capacity".    We got a room on the sixth floor (603) and found out it was quite a walk from the elevators...not a problem, even in our high heels.  The hallway and surrounding decorations were nice, which for some reason surprised me.  Our room, although a bit on the small side, was nicely decorated and felt "intimate".  Overall, I was impressed with the hotel itself.    As for our two-bed room, we got a rate of $143.10 for the night and with taxes, came to $160.27.    After we got back to the room from a night of clubbing at their in-house nightclub (Airia), we ordered room service, consisting of an order of onion rings and an order of their steak and eggs.  The food came within 20 minutes and was piping hot.  The onion rings (not from FatBurger) were delicious and the steak/eggs were perfect (medium rare and sunnyside up, respectively).  The bill (with an additional $5 tip) came to under $25.    I would definitely recommend this hotel if I had friends visiting from out of town.

Stayed here for three nights during Cinco de Mayo weekend (and Mayweather vs. Guerrero fight).  Room prices were jacked up ($1.8K for three nights!!) and almost completely booked, but we managed to snag one with a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountain show (34-49).    The Cosmo is a very nice hotel; modern, chic, and definitely geared towards the 20s and 30s crowd.  This is a party hotel, so those looking for a more serene (hah!) experience should stay at the Palazzo or Wynn (also favorites of mine).      Loved the convenience of partying at Marquee Dayclub and Nightclub without having to leave the hotel.  Highlight of my stay here was seeing Armin Van Buuren spin at Marquee Dayclub on Saturday, May 4th; he was awesome!  I've been to Marquee Nightclub many times and enjoy the ambiance; however, still scratching my head over the seemingly endless stairs women have to trek down in order to exit the place!    Ordered room service for the girls Saturday night and was quoted 1.5 hours, but food arrived within half an hour...pleasant surprise.  The spinach dip with crab and buffalo chicken wings arrived hot, and were pretty tasty - the chips were warm and crispy.  Didn't try the garden salad, but it looked fresh.    Only restaurant we had a chance to eat at here was China Poblano, and only because it was next to the Marquee Nightclub and we needed to kill time.  We ordered several dishes to share, including the twenty-vegetable fried rice, siu mai, Open Sesame noodles, and the "Don't be Jealous" hot and sour soup.  Well, I ain't jealous of the hot and sour soup; a lot left to be desired.  The Open Sesame noodles were chilled and tasted bland.  The siu mai I didn't try, but my friends claimed it was good.  The highlight of the meal was the fried rice, yes, fried rice!  What made it special was the baby veggies included in the rice, but the rice was pretty flavorful too.  The portions were small, but I'd say the $20 spent on the fried rice was worth it.  It was a bit distracting trying to eat with Marquee's club music blasting our ears, but hey, part of the "ambiance".    Love, love, love the Chandelier bar, especially the second floor, which serves my favorite drink - the Verbena!  It's a tequila based drink, but the special touch is the edible flower bud you eat before you sip your drink.  It's like pop-rocks in your mouth, and your mouth becomes numb for a few minutes, but it totally enhances the flavor of the drink!  I highly recommend this drink!  Staff we encountered during our stay were professional and accommodating - no complaints.  This trip was my first time staying at Cosmo, but I'd definitely stay here again.

Since I eat Cambodian food every week at home, I wasn't tempted to dine here, but my sis and mom have been wanting to check it out for a while.    We dined here a few weeks ago and left feeling...underwhelmed.  Service provided by the brother and sister duo was friendly; however, the food, although decent, was a bit too Westernized for my taste.  As another Yelper has mentioned, the portions are too small for the advertised prices.    We ordered the following (shared between five adults and one child):  1) beef noodle soup (similar to the Vietnamese pho / $6); 2) lok lac beef (marinated pan fried cubes of beef / $8); 3) chicken fried rice ($8); 4) pleah (beef salad $10); 5) bbq platter (shrimp & beef skewers, chicken wings / $14); and 6) pork/pate sandwich ($5).    The good: * entrees were presented beautifully on green plates reminiscent of banana leaves * with the exception of the pleah (beef salad), the food looked good and tempting * with the exception of the lok lac beef, food arrived in a fairly timely manner  * the beef skewers were delicious (can really taste the flavor of the marinade, especially the lemongrass) * iced coffee I ordered was good (albeit a bit weaker than the Viet kind / $3) * basil seed drink was good (and interesting to look at / $2) * as previously mentioned, service was friendly * the restaurant is decorated appropriately with Cambodian items  The bad: * while the rest of the entrees arrived within 20 minutes after ordering, my lok lac beef was brought to the table an HOUR later * the portion size of the lok lac beef is more indicative of a lunch serving, not dinner  * the flavor of the lok lac was decent, but not as robust as usual (perhaps the beef cubes weren't given enough time to marinate) * the pleah (beef salad) was TOO tart and had us thinking, "where's the beef?" (it did not look nor tasted like the traditional pleah we're used to - Cambodian beef ceviche)  * bring your sunglasses because the lighting in the restaurant is bright!!!  I know it makes sense to tone down some of the Cambodian flavors, but it's too toned down for my taste.  With that said, if you've not had Cambodian food, Sekong would be a good introduction to the dishes of Cambodia.  Sekong is to be commended for offering Cambodian food to valley residents.    For authentic Cambodian cuisine, you'll have to go to the LA area.  They don't care about toning down the flavors there to suit Western tastes, because shoot, there are loads of Asians to fill up their restaurants.  (In addition to the food pics from Sekong, I also posted a pic of lok lac beef I ordered from one of the LA restaurants...for comparison.)

Went here last night (Saturday) with a group of 11 ladies for a bachelorette party and had a blast.  We ended up at two tables near the patio area, which faced the fountains and afforded us gorgeous views of the strip (especially the "Eiffel Tower" at the Paris Hotel).  Loved dancing in this area as the cool air prevented us from getting too sweaty.    As others have mentioned, Hyde is much smaller than the other Vegas megaclubs, but that didn't detract from the party atmosphere.  The crowd here is more upscale, which I fully appreciated.    The music was a mix of old school and top 40s, which was good, but the night took a turn for the better when Marcus Schossow started his set...and the crowd went wild.

This salon is a great place to come and get pampered.  I've been getting eyelash extensions with Christie for close to a year and she's always consistent with the quality of work.  The salon has always been clean when I visit and everyone is friendly!  It's hard to find a nail salon with professional techs, but this is one of them, thanks to Christie's ownership & management.  Oh, they now serve beer and wine!
