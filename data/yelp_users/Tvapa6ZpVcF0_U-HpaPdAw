This is our first time at fancy pets. And what a great experience. Called to get nails trimmed because my pitbull broke one the other day so needed it trimmed up. They were more than to clean it up and also super last minute they fit her and our chiwahwah in for a bath war and nail cleaning. And all at a great price. Staff was super friendly. They definitely have us at a client now.

Love this place. From the urban feel to the service to the awesome coffee they put out. One of my favorite coffee shops

Giving 2 stars because the customer service was just horrible. Yes we came in 30 min before they close but when someone walks thru the door and automatically says "we close at 7 so all orders are to go!" Is not too welcoming. As soon as we ordered no lie another 8 people came in and yelled the same thing to them as well. There should definitely be some training in how to talk like an adult and not so rude. Gonna give the food a try and hope it doesn't match their attitudes. Which were horrible. Maybe think about staying open a little later.

Great great great food and service. I work at the salon a few doors down and all of us make Isabel's our lunch spot a few times a week. They have great happy hour and lunch specials. Great margaritas and their mexi-mule is to die for.
