Service is absolutely atrocious. Tonight I got there at 7:10 and got seated right away. 20 minutes later, got my drink. 10 minutes later, placed my order. 10 minutes later, got soup. 10 minutes later, got the salad. At that point I asked them when they would start cooking, he said after the other table, who had just started getting their dinner cooked, was done. 50 minutes there, then they say we were still 20-30 minutes away from actually eating. I've done all you can eat sushi there once before, and they only have the ability to make 3 rolls an hour, per table. Worst service I have ever experienced at ANY restaurant

Apparently this location is gremlin friendly, cause after midnight they don't serve you; unless you have cash. Sure, gizmo is happy, but no one else is. What kind of huge fast food chain doesn't accept a debit card!? A communist one, that's who. They like to brag about all day breakfast, but only with exact change and a polka dance to go with it. Absolutely ridiculous establishment.

INCREDIBLE!!! I've never taken any animal to a groomer, and this was just an incredible experience. They were my 5th or 6th groomer I had left messages for and the ONLY one to return my call in a timely manner. Ben was very nice over the phone and we set the appointment, which another company did call me back, but their next opening wasn't for another 55 days; Primp my Pet got it done in 48 hours. Kiera came to my workplace and right off the bat you could tell how much she absolutely loves doing what she is doing.  Incredibly enthusiastic, all around awesome person.  Oh yeah, the dog looked great too!

Delivery driver is outstanding, company sucks. Can't contact anyone about canceling or maintenance or anything. There's about 10 company numbers listed online, good luck finding one that won't give you a busy tone, and when you find the magic one that gives you a few prompts, it will disconnect the call before you get the chance to talk to anyone. Piss poor customer service from the company. Only reason I haven't cancelled yet is the driver busts his ass and will return my calls and make sure we're taken care of. Overall, horribly ran and managed company with absolutely zero customer service.

Awesome cigar bar! They just got their license for beer, and the Papago brewery orange blossom beer is fantastic. The staff is awesome, after the first visit they will remember you and always greet you as family every time you walk in.

DJ is a great guy to do business with. I am one of the his contractors and it's comforting to see another company that strives for customer service and satisfaction just as much as I do . He's a pleasure to work with, keeps constant communication, and will make sure the job gets done RIGHT. I wish everyone I did work for was as trustworthy and reliable as DJ
