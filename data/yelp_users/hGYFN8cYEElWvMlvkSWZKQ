I love this place.  The food is the greatest, the service is always great and there's just something about the place that makes it feel like you're at a family friend's.   Go here. If nothing else to see the tweens breaking their backs trying to carry their oversized bass guitars into the nearby music lessons studio. There's also a massage parlor that's always open a few doors down. I'd imagine it's not a very classy establishment.   Regardless, try the crab angels with the beef with peppers.

Steady. Good food. Great prices.  I have had many calzones and they have been detrimental to my health.  If I were to choose one to end my life, I'd choose Floridinos.  Not that it's unhealthy, it's just my lifestyle. Don't judge, I like flavor and flavor is not salad.

I love this place. It's not as cheap as Panda Express, but that's the point.   If you want a good, fast Chinese food experience, eat here.  If you want to get some Starbucks before or after, this is a good place too.  If you're lonely, write more yelp reviews.  Please take some time out of your day to try some Chinese that's not poured out of a semi truck shipped from California(if not further).

I work at the nearby Lowes. I eat here just about every other day.  This is the rock in my life. Always good, always prompt and always nice.  My only suggestion is to provide more seats during the lunch rush, but that's nothing they can help. Why did I even mention it? Gotta make this review longer than 2 lines.  Great representation of the I-N-Out franchise.   Pigeons like fries.

Go here for the beer on happy hour.  Otherwise, it's an overpriced bar with semi-decent food that's also overpriced.  Avoid the pizza, Tombstone freezer grade.

I was going to write a review about "hey, maybe if you don't like waiting for cheap sushi, fuck off."  I've changed my mind.  Put in the order for sushi and an egg roll at 6:50. Got the food at 7:30.   It wouldn't be such a big deal if you didn't see people who came in after you get their shit. I'm an only child and this the one time I've felt like a foster child taken into a home that just wanted me for government money.   Here's the thing, I was all sorts of boozed up on the happy hour sake bomb at 7:30 when I asked for the check. Oop! Got a catch, I was soberly pissed off at 7:55 when I actually got the check.   So, here's the deal. If you're in a time crunch, don't ever go.   If you like cheap drinks, check it out. Decent sushi, cool specials.  Staff doesn't know how to handle more than 2 tables at one time.

Everyone else here touting how amazing the wings are, they're spot on.  Decent prices. Nice staff. Great food.  The only thing that I'd change is that they don't have a soda fountain. They do have 3 koolaid fountains, which may or may not tickle your fancy.  I like blue.
