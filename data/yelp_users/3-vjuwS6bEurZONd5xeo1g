Amazing carne asada... Homemade tortillas are great and the refried beans are amazing! They also carry all the extras needed- cabbage, jalape√±os, avocados, tomatillos.... I could keep going.. Queso fresco, Pico, guacamole, delicious marinated chicken. The flavor of the meat is perfect! Try it and you won't be disappointed and the employees who works there are very nice and helpful!

Wow all the reviews are true, out of 3 drinks only 1 of ours came out correct. Only 2 girls working on a Saturday afternoon with 15 people waiting on drinks and one of them did not know the recipes, $20 wasted
