My wife and I made the drive because we wanted some wings and normally we have enjoyed ourselves.  This time we stood at the front waiting a while for the hostess and when she showed up, she was not very friendly.  After being seated we watched he take at least 5 minutes going back to the front for the next group waiting.  We waited a full 10 minutes and never were offered water or spoken to in any way by any empoyees.  We finally gave up and left as we noticed the people that came after us were also getting fed up with the wait.    I did speak to the manager on the way out and he apologized and offered a free appitizer if we wanted to stay, but we declined.  I hope he fixes things there because the employees don't appear to care about the customers.

I recently got an anniversary cake made here based on their Samoa Girl Scout Cookie cupcake and it was fantastic!  Everything I have ever had here is either really good or great.  When are tasty cupcakes not a good time?  Always fresh and moist and delicious.  I have had cupcakes from other bakeries in this area and there is a major difference.  In fact writing this review makes me want to head over there today!

I just got my first massage from Page this weekend and I will definitely be going back again! She made me feel comfortable from the moment I walked in and the appointment started right on time. The facility was very nice and inviting. I highly recommend a massage by Page.

I highly recommend taking classes here! I just had my first experience at the glass blowing class here and it was a ton of fun!  The guys were great and I am looking forward to hanging my own custom made ornament on my tree at Christmas!

Great sandwiches everytime! I love the bread. Of course they are fast, which is nice. I even like their own brand chips. If you haven't been, give it a shot asap!
