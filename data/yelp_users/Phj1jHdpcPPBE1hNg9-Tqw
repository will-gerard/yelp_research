Stumbled in one morning (about 4 AM)  looking for something to get me started and asked the "Baker" what the best Donut was. He responded that "glazed is our best." In the case I saw a Whipped Cream filled Glazed Donut. Combine two of my favorite food groups and I am a sucker.  About six or seven trips later (I have lost track!) I am still absolutely in love with this combination. The Baker swears it is real whipped cream, I doubt it but I could care less it is so good!  Don't miss it!

Based on previous Reviews here, I had high hopes of something unique and different.  Felt wonderful and warm  inside with strolling Mariachis and a festive mood. Service was impeccable!  Unfortunately, the food was only okay. It seemed that much of the menu is served "Fajitas Style" (my words, not theirs) and the Shrimp, peppers and onions were nothing special, plus the portions I thought were small (eight medium sized shrimp). No "knock you over" flavors in this dish and the best thing about the meal was the wonderfully done rice.  Won't repeat as my disappointment will not go away any time soon.

If when you go out for Italian Food and you think that Olive Garden, Buca di Beppo or even Babbo has great Italian Food, Giuseppe's is probably NOT the place for you.   If like me, you grew up thinking that your friend Vinnie's mothers daily offering of Italian Food, with aromas wafting all through the apartment building, was something very special and real Italian Food - THIS IS IT! You will have found Nirvana, as have I!  Until now, I had almost given up hope for what I call "Old World Italian Food" prepared with love and the most incredible ingredients available. It is here and being served in a friendly small environment by a knowledgeable and wonderful wait staff.  Not to mention that  the Owner is usually present and generally talks to everyone, making certain that all are satisfied. Now I ask you, is that PRIDE or what?  Based on talking with adjacent Diners, everything on the Menu;  both the "Today's Menu" (Changes sometimes daily) and the "Full Menu," seems to be pretty fabulous and receiving "Rave Reviews" from my fellow Diners!  Looking at previous Reviews, as well as Guy Fieri's recommendation, I had to have the Bolognese Ragu on my first visit. I have yet to have everything on the menu, but here are the choices I have made on my visits to date and each is NOT to be missed:          Bolognese Ragu - Don't ask! Just order it. Seven meats and homemade           Pasta that lives up to all of the previous fabulous Reviews! Like so many          before me, I am not certain I can eat here ever without having this incredible          dish, which leaves little room for anything else. Share with a friend so you can          have more of their remarkable dishes.          Burrata (Appetizer) - Mozzarella like you have never had. Do NOT overlook it          if  it is available. The description doesn't do it justice, but it is described as          a "ball of mozzarella filled with shredded mozzarella and cream." If you love          Mozzarella -this is "MOZZARELLA MECCA!"           Antipasto (Appetizer) - An absolute work of art! Do NOT be fooled by the          Menu designation of Small (they also have Large), it is NOT small, but can be          shared by two (I refuse to share!)  Incredible morsels of meat, cheese and          vegetables, with the proper amount of dressing.          Pasta e Fagioli (Appetizer) - I have a friend who says you can judge ALL          Italian Restaurant by their Pasta e Fagioli. This is a light (meant to be, it's an          Appetizer!) flavorful mixture of beans and pasta that is oh so satisfying, with          just a hint of spice.          Spaghetti and our Famous Meatballs - Not to be confused with your Mothers,          as she probably could not make this rendition. The meatballs in my sampling          were made from Veal with Ricotta and other special ingredients. If spaghetti          and meatballs were like this everywhere, we would all be Italian! Hint - you          can have the meatballs alone as an appetizer or a side dish.          Bread and Olive Oil - Nothing remarkable about the bread here, which is a          surprise, but it is the Olive Oil (with Giuseppe's label on it) that is the star. No          Balsamic needed, just pure goodness with salt and pepper to your own taste.          Take a bottle home (I have!) and pair it with your favorite bread.  Giuseppe's has definitely replaced The Restaurant (Now Pizzeria Bianco) as my favorite Phoenix Italian Restaurant. The love, pride and caring that has gone into each and every dish is more than apparent. There is no need to go elsewhere, unless for a diversion you wish to go to Andreoli Italian Grocer for their bread! Between these two you will be in "Italian Food Heaven!"

An ALL time Phoenix favorite of mine for lunch, that I have neglected to Review, but was reminded by this most recent visit.  Taking something so simple (Brushetta, A Cheese Plate, Soups) and turning them into "works of art" is an art in itself. Have eaten mostly everything on the menu at one time or another and am NEVER disappointed. They even changed my mind about liking brie - well of course their "Triple Cream Brie" had a lot to do with that - heavenly!  Their Brushetta, in addition to being beautiful to look at is absolutely FABULOUS Haven't had one I didn't like, in spite of the fact I am NOT all that fond of Smoked Salmon or Tuna, but loved their preparation!  Did I mention the "Grilled Cheese?"   Don't ask - JUST ORDER IT!   $6? Are they nuts?   No, it is worth it!  Kind of what I think each time I order it!  Lots of fun to have many for a great selection with several people sharing. Probably ALL but the soups should be shared and even the soups can be, if you are with someone you really care about!  Go, don't wait! Wonderful for lunch, nice for a casual dinner and the wait staff is generally terrific!

Another of Phoenix New Times Ten Best Tacos in Phoenix.  A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!  Another bare bones establishment that I approached with great expectations. Ordered the recommended Suadero Tacos and they came served in soggy tortillas (unforgiveable to my mind) to begin this less than fabulous experience. Very little taste to the Tacos so I found myself pouring on the hot sauce.  Will NOT return!

Admittedly, after only a couple of visits this is almost a "Single Menu Item Review." Although, I do believe that single item is indicative of the quality of the smoked meats, etc offered in this unique to Phoenix Deli. That single item?                     The Number 12 Sandwich (Without onions for me!)  Far and away the best Deli Sandwich or Submarine Sandwich  I have had since moving from New Jersey 20+ years ago. With three meats, cheese, shredded lettuce, tomatoes and a mixture of mustard and mayonnaise on Polish Rye Bread is absolutely to die for.  As warned by a Previous Reviewer a "Half Sandwich" is a full sandwich and a "Full Sandwich" is actually two sandwiches. I still have no satisfactory answer as to why. (lol)  Only two small tables for "eat in" and no beverages are offered. I go at odd hours so have been able to "Eat In" each time while bringing my own beverage. The Owner's Daughter is most accommodating and the array of Shoppers you see and hear as you partake of this fabulous sandwich is testimony to the quality of their offerings. (Saw one lady spent over $50 on assorted smokes meats!)  A terrific find!

What a gem discovered thanks to Phoenix New Times naming it one of the Best Ten Tacos in Phoenix. Couldn't have been more correct.  Did exactly as New Times suggested and had THREE "Taco al Pastor!" Ambrosia! Waitress service, in spite of my not speaking Spanish, confirmed that I had made a great choice and also suggested I try the Coca Cola Mexico. (More on it later)  When the Tacos arrive they are quite lovely and just as described. Beautiful red-orange thinly sliced pork, obviously well marinated on perfect corn tortillas (my choice) topped with onion and cilantro. Homemade salsa, fresh lime and cilantro as well as some beans in a fabulous pungent liquid finish off the Presentation.  Don't let the barebones dining room turn you away and I can promise you won't be sorry.  My rule of thumb is that I won't do good Review unless I visit twice (will do a bad one after only one horrible visit) but I have taken that rule way too far with these Tacos from heaven. Let's just say my car can find Asadero Norte de Sonora on its own!  Check the hours because they are a bit strange but GO.  Now for the Coca Cola from Mexico. I am a former Coca Cola addict (NOT Diet), but hadn't had one in several years, because the last was absolutely awful and made me wonder what I ever liked about Coca Cola! Never had Coca Cola from Mexico. Different? AMBROSIA! I could become addicted to it, as well as this very special "hole in the wall" and its Taco al Pastor!

So the Proprietor of my favorite Fish and Chips "Joint" (Marilyn's on Central) mentioned that his Sister runs one close to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and this is it.  What I said about Marilyn's:             The fish? OMG, the best! Have had all three varieties of Fish (Cod, Catfish and                Whiting) but being from Boston, COD is my absolute favorite and this is the             very best "Fried Cod" I have ever had. Don't generally like Catfish, but Marilyn's             is terrific! Want to try ALL three, get the three pieces with one of each and you             will know which to order next time. The Owner has tremendous pride in what             he does and obviously, that can be seen in his "Product." NOT fond of the              Tartar Sauce, but doesn't matter because the Fish is so extraordinary. Unlike             most Fish and Chip joints in Phoenix, the do NOT use the same batter on             everything. Makes a BIG difference.              You just can't go wrong and if you are like me, you will get a craving every             couple of weeks. FABULOUS!  This is also true of Mandy's except that the Tartar sauce is better and YOU have to select what batter is used! While Cod (priced a little higher) is still my favorite, have tried the Whiting and it is pretty terrific as well!  They do have two locations, have only been to the Jefferson one and have never had anything other than Fish and Shrimp. Why would I?

Have been eating here since Guy Fieri had it on his show, Diners Drive-ins and Dives, but have failed to Review this extraordinary little place, only a mile from my home. Maybe subconsciously I wanted to keep it to myself. Of course, with over 200 Reviews here they do NOT need mine, unless you want to know a secret.  THE SECRET: Having fallen in love with Tacos Pastor (and Mexican Coca Cola) at Asadero Norte De Sonora   (See my Previous Review) three visits ago I asked if they served Tacos Pastor (they are NOT on the menu) and one of the beautiful sisters advised that they did indeed. Oh my word! Nirvana, so close to home (Asadero Norte De Sonora is ten miles away). I knew I would be in trouble.  They are little (The Tacos) here, but have three or four and you will think you are in Heaven. The morsels of Pork are just right spicy and absolutely delicious! Wash them down with Coca Cola from Mexico and call it FABULOUS!   Prior to discovering Tacos Pastor I hade been VERY happy with the Carne Asada Tacos and as good as they are, NOT close to Tacos Pastor!  Do NOT miss this wonderful treat!

Nirvana in a Pho Bowl! Absolutely breathtaking broth chuck full of Sirloin and what they bill as "well done brisket." Enough meat to have meat even with the last mouthful. Manager told me they "stew the broth" for 24 hours before serving. No jalapeño necessary, although they serve plenty. Nice hotness, lots of bean sprouts, etc. MAGNIFICENT! Can't imagine anyone is going to find any better in Phoenix, although Pho Ao Sen comes very close in their broth quality and is a much prettier and nocer Restaurant. A relatively nice bargain at $6.50. They have an even bigger bowl at $7.50, but can't imagine it! Have had the Seafood Pho and it was Phabulous! The lady in the  kitchen is a "Master" and she ran a Pho Restaurant in Saigon in the eighties, serving 600 Bowls of Pho a day. The Father of the Owner has recently taken over operations, but as long as that little lady is in the Kitchen (The owner's Mother!) all will be well and nothing will change! My #1 best Pho in Phoenix, but only by a little over Pho Ao Sen, also in Mesa!  Asked for a Spring Roll recommendation, he recommended the "Roast Pork" and it too was Phlavorful and Phabulous!   These folks are very nice an accommodating and put out a PHABULOUS Bowl of love!

Honestly, I am at a loss.  "Hot Dogs" are in the name of this little Restaurant and being a "Hot Dog Aficionado" I had to try when I was close.  Maybe NOT the biggest disappointment I have had, but certainly ranks right up there. The hot dogs are "Sonoran Style" wrapped in Bacon and with all of the necessary "fixings" (beans, jalapenos, tomatoes, mayonnaise). From the bun bordering on stale, to the total lack of taste this was not only a disappointment but a significant waste of time. Somehow, even with bacon, there was just no taste whatsoever. Fortunately at $3.00 not big waste of money.  They could take some lessons from other "Hot Dog Joints" in Phoenix that manage to get it right!   Obviously, based on previous Reviews, I am in the minority here.

Knock out flavored Pho broth with usual assortment of lime, bean sprouts, cilantro and jalapenos on the side. A couple of sliced jalapenos into the broth for just the right amount of heat and ate down to the last drop. Could have had a little more meat (sliced very thin) but no complaints. A BIG repeat for a Great value at $5.50 for a Bowl of Pho.

This is my second favorite Restaurant in Phoenix (behind only Tarbell's) and receives consistently Phabulous reviews. I have had much on their menu and have loved almost ALL.   I have become a "Pho Aficionado" and I love the strong flavors in the best Phos. Cyclo's Pho leaves a lot to be desired! Broth is generally too thin, although the service is beautifully done. Plus their Pho is expensive when compared to other "Pho Joints" that I believe have better Pho.  Everything else I have eaten on their menu (and I have eaten most everything!) is indeed PHABULOUS, so I will just go elsewhere for my Pho Phix! Besides, I would miss NOT seeing Justina (Cyclo Owner) who is a delightful experience, not to mention the delightful experiences available on their menu, other than the Pho!!

I can't imagine a better place to eat unusual Pancakes. My favorite has become the "Dutch Baby," a smaller version of the German, served with butter, powdered sugar and lemon! Decadent, but a wonderful taste and with the texture of a popover.  Accompanying "sides" like bacon, and egg, etc., are equally skillfully prepared.  Oh, the place is a little old and right out of the 50's but a better breakfast in Phoenix, I am still looking!

In keeping with my practice of "One Visit for a NOT so good Review" and "Multiple visits for a GOOD Review,"  I wish I could give this well appointed Restaurant a better Review. The service was terrific, with a knowledgeable Server,  but unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. My salad was well dressed, although it could have had a few more ingredients (Romaine Lettuce and a single lonely cherry tomato) and my Shrimp Pasta had only three, relatively small forlorn shrimp atop some very nicely done Pasta, with an unremarkable sauce. VERY disappointing.

Excellent Pho with great taste in a smaller than usual bowl size. Might just just be as good as Dragonfly (Mesa) and Pho Ao Sen (Mesa) for taste, but their bigger bowls gives them an edge. It is ranked #1 ahead of Cyclo (Chandler) for food by the Arizona Republic and interestingly enough, the young Man who runs it is the Nephew of Justina the Owner at Cyclo. GREAT PHO! Okay Springrolls.

It is already so crowded in the morning that another Five Star Review might only bring more Yelpers into the fold, but that is what this is - a FIVE STAR REVIEW.  From unique seating to incredible baked goods (have tried a dozen different ones and each is WONDERFUL!), to great coffee (I prefer "Dark" at $2 and FREE refill) and NOT TO BE MISSED hot breakfast entrees (BEST Gravy and Biscuits I have had in Phoenix - I prefer Sausage - Dutch Pancake, where I prefer the sweet).  There have been occasions (rare!) where I have not had to wait, but most times there is a line. Worth whatever wait is in store.  Great place for Breakfast or just coffee and a newspaper!

In keeping with my practice of no good reviews unless two visits, the Delux held up quite nicely.  Unfortunately, having tried both variations of their Burger (The Delux and The Standard) I did discover that the flavor of the Delux comes from the accompaniments and NOT the beef. This comes to light with the Standard, as without onions it does lack the "beefy flavor" one expects from an extraordinary Hamburger. Certainly a presentable and repeatable experience, although NOT sure it stacks up against other premium priced Burgers. Their late hours (open til 2:00 AM) are a plus forNightowls.  Biggest hit are the Sweet Potato Fries and the accompanying Aioli. FABULOUS, almost beyond adequate description. Plus the service in a miniature grocery cart is very cute!  Not the best of the Premium Burgers in town (See The Grind) but worth repeating occasionally.

Fabulous French Baguettes are baked on premises and used for their Vietnamese sandwiches - Banh Mi. The bread is so good, I bring two hot loafs home and  freeze with my recently discovered frozen fresh bread method (double wrapped, once in paper towels and again in aluminum foil), although at only $1 each, one could go there every day to but fresh. My choice of the many varieties of Banh Mi (three times!) is the "Bar-B-Que Pork" and it is fabulous! It is loaded with pickled carrot, daikon radish, cilantro, onion and jalapeno. "Grilled Pork" will my next choice, as it is highly recommended by several Reviewers. One hint to make it even better, opt for "extra meat" at only $1 more.

This has become a favorite after only a few visits. Fortunately I have had the opportunity to see many dishes with "tablemates," and much of what I have seen and eaten is extraordinary. The menu is large with lots of choices to confuse. So far, I haven't seen anyone disappointed.  The only thing keeping it from being Five Stars for me is that the service can and often is a little slow, with various excuses given. Additionally, on a couple of occasions I have felt cramped in by the other tables being so close.   The food, in both preparation and appearance here is FIRST RATE and while their extensive menu is too big to have sampled even a small percentage of it, somehow I feel it wouldn't be there (on the menu) if it wasn't going to be terrific.  A great little "find," that has already been found by many.

My favorite Restaurant in Phoenix by far, I keep searching for better, but who knows why!  Dishes that separate Tarbell's from others:   Soups to die for  Caesar the way it was meant to taste  Pommes Frites as heavenly as any in Paris or                                       Brussels  Sliders to crave many days after  Scotch Beef I continue to dream about  Pan Roasted chicken - I NEVER order chicken in a                                       Restaurant, except here  Mac & Cheese good enough for dessert  If this isn't FIVE STAR in Phoenix, I can't imagine what is, but I want to go there!

I believe it is safe now after a half a dozen visits and never being disappointed, to review Roy's.  My most recent visit (last week) was pretty typical. FABULOUS service from a Lady who knew exactly how to successfully wait on a small party. As usual, her impeccable service made the experience all the more enjoyable.  I always have a difficult time NOT having The Butter Fish dish. It had been voted as one of the Top Ten Dishes in Las Vegas when I lived there a couple of years ago and, although I have never eaten Butterfish anywhere else - OUT OF THIS WORLD!  On this particular visit, our party had a couple of Appetizers (Pot Stickers, Sea Scallops) and two salads (Chopped, Maui Wowie Shrimp) as well as the aforementioned Butterfish entrée our other entrees included, Salmon and both of the available Mahi Mahi dishes.  EVERYTHING was prepared superbly and I can honestly say, that outside of Legal's (East Coast) Roy's does fish better than any other Chain, and better than most Independents specializing in fish.  A great treat every visit and this past one was as good if not better thanany!    Can't miss here.

Found myself on the Westside and of course had to sample some well reviewed and well rated Pho! This is very nice Pho and fortunately for me I have four I ranked slightly higher that are closer to me in the East Valley, as this is very far to go for Pho. VERY nice broth, lots of meat (although a couple of pieces were a little tough) served by the little Vietnamese Lady who obviously is responsible for its delicate flavor. Beats out lots of very well regarded "Pho Joints," quite handily. Nice surprise and very close to my #3 ranked Pho Phind!

Where to begin?  How about the fact that it looks and feels like an old time neighborhood Italian Grocery Store or Delicatessen, with tables in the middle of the store? You know, the kind where the Proprietor kept track of what your family owed him in a spiral notebook. If you grew up where I did, you probably had at least one of these. I was lucky in that my neighborhood had two, but neither was as good as Andreoli's!  How about the fact that they have a Regular Menu and a Special Board every day and I have NEVER had anything I didn't like or absolutely love, after more than a dozen visits?  How about the fact that I have pretty much narrowed down my choices on each visit to one Appetizer (Have had almost all the sandwiches and they are great but too filling to have anything else) and a "Special?"  How about the fact that on each visit I absolutely MUST HAVE the Italian Bread with Extra Virgin Olive Oil (have to order - it's a "Deli!")? Absolutely the very best Italian Bread I have had since leaving the East Coast. A bit expensive but I take a loaf (BIG!) home, slice it, put paper towels between the slices, put all in a plastic bag in my freezer. Thaws out as it went it! Delicious!  How about the fact that going with friends allows you to have more "tastes" by ordering lots of different dishes?  How about the fact that the folks behind the counter (specially the young Lady) are knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful?  How about the fact I have NEVER been for Dinner but friends who have say it is just as terrific as lunch?  How about the fact that the Pricing for "Specials" may be a little steep (especially the Seafood Specials) but the quality is absolutely First Class and almost all are well worth the price?  How about the fact that I can't list my recommendations, as it would just be a restatement of the Menu, but have the "Fries?"  I guess I have not only started, but have finished as well.

Maybe my favorite "Breakfast Place" in Phoenix.  My general "rule of thumb" is to NOT give good or great ratings until I have been several times. I have been here so often that I have had many of the menu items, from the very simple to the unique and original and have seldom been disappointed. The exception is the Corned Beef Hash. A different take on that traditional, as are many of the "Specialties," but just NOT hearty enough for me and the portion, much unlike most everything else, was fairly skimpy.  Bacon to die for, eggs always as requested, toast and hash browns are excellent and the service is always fast and courteous. That being said, I am not at all certain what other Reviewers experienced when they give this little place a less than stellar review.  Never did for lunch, but Breakfast is a winner!

Philadelphia is pretty far to go for the "real thing," but I have been blown away twice at how close they come to replicating a great Philly Cheesteak! They do a fabulous job!  Oh sure, the roll isn't nearly as good as Delassandro's (my favorite in Philly') and it probably doesn't measure up to this year's winner (Johnny's Hots) in Philadelphia Magazine, but these people are doing a great job with what they have. They even offer one so large, I believe it comes with wheels, so you can drive it home.  Great taste and you can have Cheese Whiz on it to make it even more authentic. Plus look at ALL you will have saved in airfare!  If the rolls were better I would have opted for FIVE STARS, but these rolls will suffice to make it a terrific experience.

Just when I thought I had been to ALL the best "Pho Joints" in Phoenix (I believe I have eaten in a total of 13!), up pops this one, which was listed (ranked) only as the #5 Best Vietnamese Restaurant by the Arizona Republic. The Arizona Republic got it wrong; the Pho was "ambrosia." Very aromatic, nice amount of meat and delicious! Not only am I ranking it #2 and only slightly behind Dragonfly, it is by far the best looking and best appointed Restaurant of any of the Pho Joints I have seen. Also, it is run by a gorgeous Vietnamese young lady who does ALL of the cooking and is usually there to greet you! GREAT, I mean GREAT Springrolls complete or start this trip to "Pho Heaven!" - Best Springrolls in Phoenix! On my second trip I had the Chicken Wings, recommended in The Republic as "delicious," equally PHABULOUS and have had them often since!

We came for lunch and spent over $100 between two of us on Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegars and Olive concoctions of all kinds. The tastings are fun and always available apparently. While we didn't take the tour, we did listen in for a bit and it sounded very interesting. Can reserve Tours in advance and appears to be a must.  Del Piero for lunch was terrific. Brushetta rivaling my ALL time favorite Brushetta, at the Postino Wine Café in Phoenix. Sandwiches are excellent as well. DO NOT MISS the "Olive Oil Cupcake!" Startlingly wonderful!  A bit of a drive to get to, but well worth the trip for the experience and learning, not to mention a very nice lunch!

Can't afford Binkley's but decided, based on Reviews here, to "Do Lunch" at Café Bink - TWICE.  If you can stay with one item from the Menu, price won't be a concern. Two items and it can get a bit "Pricey," - but, WELL WORTH IT!  Yet to have an Entrée or a sandwich,  as I can't get passed the Appetizer list. My favorites?                         Mussels - in white wine broth, garlic toast is absolutely FABULOUS!                         Pulled to order Mozzarella - served with red onion marmalade, pesto,                         confit and compari tomatoes. Secret here is the accompaniments. You                         could put any of the three of them on shoe leather and it would be                         wonderful. On the Fresh Pulled Mozzarella, AMBROSIA!                        Calamari - in capers, butter, tomato, lemon is my FAVORITE, do not                        miss it!  I eat at the bar (I am alone!) where the service is wonderful. Did I mention the bread? Incredible and a must for the Mussels and Calamari!  Can't do much better for lunch!

Just when I thought I was finished discovering new (for me) "Pho Joints" in Phoenix Metro, I had to hit one more (now up to 13 visited!) and WOW, a very big winner. Broth that rivaled Dragonfly (My #1) and Pho Ao Sen (My VERY close #2), with lots of very tasty meat and the usual accompaniments. I much prefer Broth with a bold flavor and this one fits the bill. Upscale location that was very busy during lunch with lots of "Pho" being served to Vietnamese and other  patrons. I guess at $7.50 per bowl a BARGAIN for "Pho" with this quality taste!

What an amazing out of the way find! Have been here several times (won't review a good Restaurant unless I have been to it twice) and have NOT been disappointed in the least.  Sandwiches are a trademark and I have had several that are all unique and delicious. Bigger appetite, have dinner here. Not fancy (no white linen) but the food will wow! Even something as simple as a "Mixed Grill" was uniquely prepared and delicious. Soups are also a specialty and if the soup is great - they've got me! Great it is.  A fair distance for most to travel, but worth the drive out. Check for open hours as they can be strange.

Phoenix Magazine got it right naming this little neighborhood jewel as one of "The Best New Restaurants in Phoenix!" Service was attentive and helpful with the very eclectic menu.  Have ordered five dishes that were each unique ("Roasted Beets"), satisfying ("Fried Chicken and Waffles"). very tasty ("Catfish Oscar") and a twist on the normal ("Garden Salad"). Desserts, based on the "Pear Cake," are absolutely out of this world and NOT to be missed! In addition to my savoring the selections, adjacent diners were raving about their selections, different from mine, as well!  Will easily, with one or two more visits, become my "Favorite in Phoenix," if both the quality and taste continue to excel and somehow I believe they will.

Most impressed as I have been to the Proprietors Parents Pizza Restaurant (twice) in Ahwatukee and find it to be NOT very good with all of the flavors much to heavy. This experience was very different and maybe even extraordinary.  Almost flaky crust, not nearly as thin as I like it, but done very nicely as a compliment to the toppings and NOT an overpowering plaza for them to sit on.  The Potato Pizza was to die for as was Mushroom Pizza (Fungi) each with their distinctive flavors and all of the flavors of the various ingredients were allowed to come through, as opposed to just a mélange of flavor.  The Calamari and Shrimp (Fried) appetizer was excellent also, although NOT a very big portion.  I am converted!

VERY well regarded here on Yelp and filled with Vietnamese. I was the only non-Vietnamese of maybe 25 or 30 customers this visit. Another "Bargain Priced" bowl at $4.50 and was just too oily or greasy for me. Nice flavor, but the oiliness was fairly overwhelming and just did NOT enjoy as much as others, less oily.  Nice Spring Rolls but, although giving it two stars, would NOT repeat as the texture of the Pho threw me and kept me from enjoying it. Obviously "locals" were loving it as everyone had a big steaming bowl in front of them in 110 degree heat outside. Maybe the $4.50 low price tage is the attraction.  Doesn't compare to my two favorites: Dragonfly and Pho Ao Sen, both in Mesa

Cute place, interesting and fairly priced menu. Unique clientele (e.g. Tattooed Lady, Old Muscle Guy). Coffee, purportedly medium roast, was way too weak to enjoy, as I am a "stron coffee aficionado."  Blueberry Bran muffin was to die for.   Lady on counter was lost at using the available technology, must have been new. Not necessarily a "do over" because of the not very good coffee and proximity to Starbucks and Lux.  Two Stars because of the VERY GOOD Muffin!

Hard to imagine that as good as Marilyn's is that there are only ten Reviews here. Okay, so the neighborhood is not so good, but I have been there in the morning (11 AM), afternoon and evening and all is well. Just now Reviewing and NOT certain why I have waited so long. Maybe I just didn't want share.   The fish? OMG, the best! Have had all three varieties of Fish (Cod, Catfish and Whiting) but being from Boston, COD is my absolute favorite and this is the very best "Fried Cod" I have ever had. Don't generally like Catfish, but Marilyn's is terrific! Want to try ALL three, get the three pieces with one of each and you will know which to order next time. The Owner has tremendous pride in what he does and obviously, that can be seen in his "Product." NOT fond of the Tartar Sauce, but doesn't matter because the Fish is so extraordinary. Unlike most Fish and Chip joints in Phoenix, the do NOT use the same batter on everything. Makes a BIG difference. Can't go without ordering Fish and Chips, so have only had Shrimp as an additional Menu Item and they were excellent.  You just can't go wrong and if you are like me, you will get a craving every couple of weeks. FABULOUS!

Appears as if I might be in the minority here, but I prefer The Grind's Hamburger over Delux by quite a margin!  Having tried two of the three varieties of Burgers on the menu, the "BLT" is humongous and quite fabulous, with real beef flavor coming through even the bacon, but bring your appetite to this one. The "Sweet and Spicy" is very different, but yet again the beef flavor does break through the accompaniments and I liked it very much as well.  Fries were excellent and the overpriced Scalloped Potatoes (essentially Mashed potatoes and cheese) were to die for and I am NOT sure why!  Five Star Hamburgers, in spite of the price!

Having now tried all three of Phoenix upscale Hamburger Emporiums, unfortunately Zinburger is my least favorite.  The quality of the burger seemed fine, although for $10, fine doesn't seem to be enough. The regular French Fries were nice and crisp. The taste of the Burger doesn't come close to The Grind which I rate to be #1, followed closely by Deluxe. There wasn't that beefy goodness and charbroiled taste to this burger  I wanted to like this expensive burger as the location is terrific and the service, even on a slow afternoon, was quite wonderful. Unfortunately, it neither lived up to expectations or to its competitiors.   If I am going to "splurge" on a Burger it is going to have to be The Grind or Delux "after hours."

Absolutely the best French Fries I have had in Phoenix. Have visited Jimmie's several times, so it wasn't just a fluke. They are fresh with great outside crunch and wonderful inside. I am a purest so a little black pepper and malt vinegar - NIRVANA!  I just wish their Hot Dogs were of better quality and with more taste. A brand like Boars Head Natural Casing, Sabrett Natural Casing, Nathans Natural Casing or Hebrew National Natural Casing instead of Vienna Brand, which I find too bland, and they could increase their prices. Load the Hot Dog up with toppings and you'll survive, as the Fries make it all worthwhile!  French Fries - 5 STARS  Hot Dog - 3 STARS

Longing for a juicy (greasy!) burger? Well here it is, in one of the Valley's four new Smashburger locations!  Juicy, juicy, juicy! Nice taste. Probably the closest to my favorite ("Steak and Shake" - none in the Valley or west of Texas) I have had. Opted for the  1/2 pound and it is too big.   Big  question is - worth more than twice the price ($4.99 for 1/3 pound and $5.99 for  1/2 pound) as for "In and Out" double-double and unfortunately the answer is no, I don't think so. Much like Fudruckers, which I would rate ahead of Smashburger for taste, it will be a "once in a while place" for me.  The "Haystack Onion Rings" were to die for, but a VERY small order, that without a sandwich are priced at a very pricey $2.99 ($1.99 with a sandwich)! Excellent!  Very clean, lots of help and nicely done, but prices are a bit much for fast food Hamburger.

New in Ahwatukee area and probably a great example of why Restaurants have such a great failure rate. A great concept very poorly executed!  While my "Test Breakfast" was absolutely awful, I was more interested in the comments of the people around me.   "Very slow service."   "Doesn't taste like a pancake."  "Even the coffee is awful."  "This sausage tastes like bologna."  My "Test?"  Sausage Gravy and Biscuits. Seems for a place named "Biscuits," this dish should be a trademark signature dish. Absolutely awful taste! Made with link sausage and the fellow "breakfaster" was correct, when he said that the sausage tasted like bologna! The gravy was pasty and tasted like flour with no sausage taste at all. Not even a butter taste to it. Quite possibly the worst I have ever had!   The biscuits you ask? Awful as well, being thin and tasteless bordering on way too salty and equally inedible.  Incidentally, when asked "how was everything" I replied "not good," the Cashier didn't follow up to ask what was wrong, she just gave me my change and said "thanks for coming in."  They will have to get lots better in order to make it. I won't try it again, but my prediction is they won't last.

Well, my Granddaughter fell in love with this crunchy Ice Cream at the Oakland A's Spring Training Stadium and just had to have it again. Made crunchy by the liquid nitrogen used to freeze it right before your eyes.  Quite a trip from where we live (Ahwatukee) but we decided to make it one Friday after school, to see if we still loved it as much as the first time.  WE DID! Both of us!  Fun to watch them make it and fun to decide on mix-ins, etc. It is also VERY good quality Ice Cream, although a bit colder than normal Ice Cream. The owner said it would NOT be as crunchy as at the Ballpark, because that was outside so they made it colder so it wouldn't melt so fast.  Suggest you pay attention to the first choice - "butterfat." We both selected the richest and it compares very favorably to our favorite - Haggen Daz. Very rich and creamy.  The Ice Cream parlor is clean and neat and obviously ownership takes pride in what they do!   A fun experience and a wonderful treat to eat, plus they offer a "Yelp Discount" which is very nice.   In spite of the distance, we will be returning, I am certain.

Having tried Five Guys on the East Coast (where they originated) and liking their Burgers, I was very excited at the new location, so close to home.   My first experience was with Fried Onions only. Unfortunately, I believe the onions (which are NOT fried to order) gave the Burger a "chemical taste." The fries have a nice taste but will order them well done in the future, in order to avoid the sogginess.   Not dissuaded by a NOT GREAT experience, my next trip I tried the "traditional" lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. Very little taste and the Burger, while large enough with two patties, seemed overwhelmed by the mayonnaise. Well done Fries were better than the first.   "Third time is the charm" I thought.   The acid test would be "pickles and mustard." If the burger was good, it would stand up to this, as do Fudruckers and Steak and Shake. Alas, not to be! The Burgers flavor did not make it through the mustard. Unfortunate, but Five Guys will NOT be on my Burger list in the future.

I am not at all certain that I could have been more disappointed. I was hoping for a challenger to my very favorite Tacos (Asadero del Norte Sonora) but alas, it was not to be.  Cute, tidy place where at 6 PM on a weeknight, I was the only Customer.  Of the three Tacos I ordered, only one (Carne Asada) was edible and it was good. The other two (Pastor and Chicarrone) had absolutely no taste whosoever and the texture left a great deal to be desired.  Will NOT repeat for another try, too many other alternatives.

Unfortunately, I will be sticking with my own policy of "Good Reviews require two visits, NOT so good Reviews require only one."  I wish I could say something wonderful about this new concept restaurant, other than the fact that it was cute, clean and the staff (two people) were very friendly, but the good comments stop there.  I opted for the Grilled Cheese with tomatoes and bacon (at the Proprietors suggestion) on Sour Dough Bread. Now I love Grilled Cheese, almost with anything on it, so this concept was right up my alley. Price on the menu was a little high for what it was ($7.65 with tax), but if it was fabulous - NO PROBLEM, I would be a loyal Customer!  The Grilled Cheese was plain and only okay. The magic ingredient to me in most Great Grilled Cheese Sandwiches is - BUTTER. Some recipes and friends put it inside the sandwich as well as on the outside to grill it. I guess "With Butter It Is Better" is true. I have had low quality cheese on Wonder Bread that was made to taste fabulous with a hot griddle and BUTTER. My youngest daughter started making them when she was little and hers' were and are to this day, quite wonderful!  Oh for that to be the case here. I believe the ingredients were/are top quality with Tilamahook Cheeses and Boar's Head Brand meats and cheeses being advertised and served. The finished Grilled Cheese was dry and in spite of the bacon, almost tasteless. Nice quantity of well melted cheese, but the bread added nothing and the tomato was equally tasteless. All in all, NOT even a good, never mind great grilled cheese sandwich. A major disappointment! Served with some nice crisp potato chips, I probably wouldn't have finished the sandwich if I had breakfast this day, it was that unappetizing.   I had hoped to be blown away and forced to make the 14 mile trip (one way) from my home often, but I won't be going back.

This little Chinese Restaurant is a great example of why there are almost 41,000 Chinese Restaurants in the U. S. (Chinese Restaurant News). That is more locations than McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Taco Bell COMBINED! You can't please everyone!  In four visits I have been pleased by each and am now a "Regular." The most pleasing of their dishes that I have tried are:                Cold Spicy Noodles and Cucumbers -  BEST Noodle Dish I have EVER                had! Almost addictive!                Dumplings of Any Kind - (Ask for "Soup Dumplings" - XLB = Xiao Long                Bao, NOT on the menu but THE BEST!)                Chicken Fried Rice- FABULOUS!                Orange Chicken -  consider putting it over that Fried Rice.               Beef or Pork Pies - A bit disappointing, given the hype, but Good               Pot Stickers - Not as well done as I like, but GOOD!)   I was disappointed in the Chive or Green Onion Pancakes, but others rave about them.  A gem of a find to be certain!

Not being a Fan of either of his two Camelback (and 32nd St) Restaurants it was hard for me to imagine I would like this one any better when a friend suggested it. First let me say that I am NOT necessarily a "Bargain Hunter,"  so the fact that there was a "Happy Hour Menu" from 11 AM on wasn't going to sway me. Also to be noted, I have only visited for Lunch.   There are however incredible bargains on the Happy Hour Menu and between friends and myself we have had almost ALL of the offerings. Several are amazing! Most notably:             ALL FOUR of the "Very Happy Hour" offerings are memorable             The Bistro Tenderloin & Panzanella Salad is FABULOUS!             The Risotto Carbonara is AMAZING!  If lunch is an indication, the quality here is absolutely superb and is a NOT TO BE MISSED experience!  The Service on each visit has been impeccable, with the waiter almost unbelieving that we would order so many different offerings.  Plus what is wrong with having delicious bargains for lunch? NOTHING I tell you!

My all time favorite Fast Food Hamburger is Steak & Shake - none in Arizona.  Freddie's is close! With that wonderful crust like coating on the Burger, which I have had in several iterations. My favorite "Test" of a fast food burger is how it holds up with only two simple additions - pickles and mustard. Only two until now can withstand this test and still deliver taste - Steak and Shake and Fuddruckers. Now Freddie's has become my favorite Arizona Fast Food Hamburger.  Want to go for the gusto? Try the Triple. More taste than one can handle!  Oh, the French Fries are absolutely terrific, if you like the really skinny kind, which I do.  Have tried the Chicago Hot Dog - nothing special.  The Custard? It is indeed richer and creamier than regular Ice Cream, but I seldom have room for it.   Taste, Taste, Taste! WONDERFUL!  Nice friendly employees as well and every time (several by now) I have been, a Manager comes to ask if everything is to our satisfaction, in a very clean and nice environment.

I am NOT going to Review Pizzeria Bianco (which I finally got into, after four tries!)  as there is no way it could ever live up to the hype and it didn't for me.  That being said - DO NOT MISS THE BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX, part of The Bianco Braintrust!  This is a remarkable Restaurant to say the least. Slow or busy, the staff is excellent, the place simply and nicely decorated and the food quality very consistent.  I have had or shared most of the menu items, including two of the three Pizza offerings (each was delicious, with thin crust) and they have been unanimously delicious. A relatively short menu, but here are my favorite standouts:               Crunchy Brussel Sprouts Salad - is to die for! DO NOT MISS IT!               Market Salad - is excellent, but I can't NOT order the Brussel Sprouts Salad               Francesca's Meatballs - Excellent, as is the Marinara Sauce              Cavatelli (which I love) - might be the best ever!              Tangelo Chicken Involtino -  is quite fabulous and I seldom order chicken  The bread is excellent and here is NOTHING not to like that I have ordered. A couple of dishes, although good, were not as unique, as flavorful and as sumptuous as the ones above (which raise the bar relatily high!), yet still VERY GOOD.               The Pasta Fagiola is a little thick for my taste,  but great flavor.               The Grilled Asparagus, while very nice, was NOT as unique as other dishes  Had pretty much given up on excellent Italian Food in Phoenix, but this jewel has restored my "Italian Cravings!"

Two visits and I am STUFFED! A reference to the "Stuffed Cinnamon Swirl French Toast" which is filled with vanilla cream and topped with caramelized bananas. OMG and absolute MUST HAVE! Had to eat it alone, but would be  a great dish to share!  A very cute and memorable Café with an amiable, helpful, attentive and willing owner waiting on you.  On the "Savory Side" the Prosciutto, Arugula and Goat Cheese Frittata are eggs, imported prosciutto, fresh arugula, goat cheese and green onion. Served with seasoned potatoes and buttered toast. Order the Potatoes "Well Done" and they are FABULOUS. A very intriguing and tasty Breakfast or Brunch!  Main dishes are definitely FIVE STAR, but a little attention to the cold toats, far too cold butter to spread on the toast and the lukewarm coffee might be needed.  Important note. They are CLOSED ON TUESDAYS and say the open at 7:30 AM (on their Business Cards) or 8:00 AM (on their Door) but on two separate occasions they were locked up tighter than a drum at 8:15 AM. The two occasions I was successful were both around 10:00 AM, busy but none of the poor service others have noted in their Reviews.

I am NOT certain which I am more disappointed in, writing this less than stellar Review or the dining experience itself, as I approached my visit with great anticipation.  I believe that the recent Positive Republic Review and others may have stressed this little Restaurant beyond its capability. The Cashier mentioned that ""we have been slammed," although there were only four others dinning at other tables on this day. Nonetheless, my father (A Chef) always said that "the test of a good Restaurant is consistency." That being said, my Review follows.  I opted on my first visit to "Test" lots, so I went for the "Sample Plate." It had:             Stuffed Cabbage - which was cold, not even warm, but of excellent             quality with a nice tomato sauce.             Home Made Polish Sausage - Absolutely tasteless. Not even a hint of spice,             it also was served less than hot and not really even warm.             Pierogi - I opted for three different kinds and found each to be pasty and             without much flavor, although unlike their "plate mates" they were served             hot. Caramelized onions would have been a good and likely tasty addition,             but I opted for the sour cream. My barometer for Pierogi is a New Jersey             Polish Restaurant and unfortunately, even after all these years, I have NOT             found any others to measure up.  The staff was quite nice and welcoming, although meals are served on paper plates with plastic utensils and that is generally a "no, no" for me, as it makes cutting things (Polish Sausage) difficult.  Value? Not at all certain that if everything was FABULOUS, I would have felt it was a good value.  In keeping with my personal philosophy of writing a Good Review only after two visits or more and writing a "Less Than Good Review" after only one visit, I will NOT be returning.

An ALL time Phoenix favorite of mine for lunch is Postino Arcadia, so I was excited to try their newest location.   They are able to take something so simple (Brushetta, A Cheese Plate, Soups) and turn them into "works of art," just as the original does.   Their Brushetta, in addition to being beautiful to look at is absolutely FABULOUS Haven't had one I didn't like, in spite of the fact I am NOT all that fond of Smoked Salmon or Tuna, but loved their preparation!  Lots of fun to have many for a great selection with several people sharing. Probably ALL but the soups should be shared and even the soups can be, if you are with someone you really care about or ask for an additional empty bowl!  Very nice location and now with better weather, wide open. If I had one complaint, the recorded music has been far too loud on both occasions I was there. Still a great place for lunch with a wide variety of wonderful things on the menu!

Having been one of those "Crazies" who waited in line at the Original Dottie's in San Francisco, how refreshing to be able to walk in, sit down and have a piping hot (steaming) cup of coffee almost immediately? Very!  That being said, it has taken me several visits, alone and with friends,  to decide if this version of Dottie's deserves Four or Five Stars. Well, Four Stars is my Rating. Why?         The Daily Muffin Special - EXTRAORDINARY!         The Pancakes - Anything served with real Maple Syrup will win!        The Pulled Pork Omelet - Marvelous!        The Lamb Sausage Omelet - Unique and great.        The Cornbread - I want the recipe!        The French Toast - In spite of the Maple Syrup, just okay         Black Bean Cakes - NOT as good as I remember the originals        The Southwestern - Disappointing for the price  The Patio is wonderful and the service equally wonderful.  Why NOT five Stars? I believe when they get their "legs under them" Dottie's will be a "go to" for breakfast in Scottsdale. Right now it is just darn good!

Wonderful! If you are a fan of thin crust pizza without overpowering sauce - THIS IS IT! Noyt a lot of variety, but I have tried four different ones and they are all excellent, brick oven done. You won't be dissapointed and the place is very cute/casual! Has become my "go to Pizza" for both "eat in" and "take home"

So in case you didn't "catch her" in 2014, do NOT miss her in 2015. Only here in Phoenix through April? An absolute "must have" for anyone who loves Maine Lobster.  As much as I love Lobster, I love authentic Fried Clams ("Belly Clams") even more.   Last year having both the Fried Clam Roll (I say, in my best Maine Accent, "aye, foget the bread" and just eat the FABULOUS CLAMS!) and the Cold (my preference) "Lobsta Roll" set one back $36. A dear price for sure, but worth every penny for a "Maine Fix."   Have had both Fried Clams and "Lobsta Rolls" all over Maine (e.g. Harraseeket, 5 Islands, Spraques, Bobs and Reds, to name a few) and this "Lobster Lady" compares very well! Plus you save the Air Fare!  Do NOT miss her this year!

As mentioned by others, The Maine Lobster Lady is a "seasonal visitor" to Phoenix (December to April) and I have been a BIG FAN.  I have visited her this season and came away a bit disappointed this time. Oh, the freshness was FABULOUS and you will not get better tasting Lobster anywhere in Phoenix, not to mention Fried Whole ("Belly") Clams, which can't be found anywhere else in Phoenix.  My disappointment? I believe she has taken two Price Increases on her Lobster Rolls at once.             The ACTUAL PRICE is now almost $20, certainly a dear price, unless you  are             having a "Lobster Roll Craving" that can't be quenched elsewhere.              The PORTION seems sharply reduced from last year when I visited her              several times.  Maybe she has put herself into a "Luxury Category" that would be / is unaffordable to most.  That being said, of about a dozen food trucks in Scottsdale that evening, she was the only one with a line. Of course, patrons do not know the price until they get to the front of the line and the portion until they receive their order.  So, if you need a fix, be prepared, it won't be cheap!

Have had several favorites (of Mine!) from the menu and none have been disappointing.  Service is excellent and finally an "East Coast Deli" here in The Valley. For those of us who have been here many years, it is easy to forget what a Great Deli in New York, Boston or Baltimore is like. Abe's will remind you.  My choices:                    Gefilte Fish Appetizer - The BEST and beautifully served!                    Chopped Chicken Liver - Oh my, FABULOUS!                    Potato Latkes - Excellent                     Noodle Kugel - Just GREAT!                    Three Rueben Sliders - Enough for Lunch and it is an Appetizer!  I really do NOT need the rest of the menu, but the Corned Beef is excellent as is the Brisket (although once it was a bit too dry).  Maybe a little more generous with the pickles (two slices look pretty lonely on the place) which are excellent.  A "go to place" for lunch, if you love "Deli!"

This is another rare violation of my own personal policy of "two visits before a stellar review." In this case, I must tell any and all readers that I have discovered the VERY BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN PHOENIX.  Ezekiel's is transplanted from York, Pennsylvania and it is our good fortune that they landed in Ahwatukee. A little short on ambiance (can you imagine old fashioned Formica topped luncheonette table ambiance) it really doesn't matter. Take it home; it seems everyone else is, based on the customers there on a Saturday evening taking theirs home.  Ezekiel's has managed to do with fried chicken what Lolo's, Mrs. Whites and others here in Phoenix just can't measure up to. The cooked to order Fried Chicken is served up golden crispy on the outside, yet still light, without that heavy batter so many insist on using and no oily taste whatsoever. Ezekiel's is doing it right and in my opinion, better than almost any others I have had, even better than the now world famous Willie Mae's Scotch House in New Orleans. In addition to that golden crust outside, each piece is tender and juicy on the inside. The breast portion is as big a chicken breast as you have even seen! The only drawback with that large a breast is that I found I ran out of "crispy skin" long before I was done with the luscious white meat. Absolutely flawless fried chicken and reasonably priced at 8 pieces for $10.99 (with two servings of cornbread) and 12 pieces for $13.99 (with three servings of cornbread). Price really doesn't make a difference, for fried chicken of this quality, I would pay more!  The normal "sides" you expect to find in a "Soul Food Restaurant" are here, with collard greens, fried cabbage, sweet potatoes, potato and macaroni salad, etc. My choice, based on the recommendation of the very nice lady who took my order (a daughter in this family owned establishment) was Baked Macaroni and Cheese and it did not disappoint.  I am going to find it hard to try their other specialties (Catfish, Tilapia, Ribs, Crab Cakes and Salmon Cakes) because I will NOT be able to resist the fried chicken. Maybe I will try the others for lunch.  Get there and when you do, chances are you will find me waiting for my next order of the VERY BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN PHOENIX!

You haven't been?   GO!   The sooner the better!  How is that for a short Review? Been at least a dozen times and have eaten from ALL of their Menus (which do change periodically). Have NEVER been disappointed. The must haves:  * Pork Shoulder Tostadas (FABULOUS!) * Charcuterie (Always a treat and some surprises - pickled grapes? Delicious) * Duck - NOT Pig, but generally wonderful! * Vinegar Pie (usually combined with a fruit like Strawberry) MAGICAL!  Certainly has become one of my favorites and open late night or early morning, depending on your schedule. I BET IT WILL BECOME ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES AS WELL!

In keeping with "Poor Review after one visit (why would I go again?) and a Good Review after at least two visits" I regret having to write this one after only one Review. I approached the experience with VERY high hopes. I let the "Server," who was extraordinarily helpful and very upbeat, decide what I should "try" on my first visit. He suggested:                One Green Chili Pork Shoulder Enchilada                One  Short Rib Enchilada  My Server covered it and after a bit of time in the Brick Over, added Guacamole and Crema (again his recommendation).  One problem, they both tasted identical. Couldn't tell the difference. I believe this stems form everything hot being kept in a steam table (ugh!) and obviously NOT freshly prepared. The taste was spicy but considering the amount of meat (a fairly good portion) I was surprised that the meat taste didn't come through.  The cost of over $9 for two relatively small Enchiladas I thought was a bit steep, but if the quality was better, maybe okay.  With so many good to great "Mexican" alternatives, wouldn't rank in my Top Ten by any stretch.  VERY disappointed!

I am always impressed when "Pride Shows Through" in any undertaking. In this little restaurant, their Pride certainly shows through.  Have had several (I guess many) of the items on their menu and each is prepared with caring and obvious love. Some (make that many!) hits and a couple of misses, (e.g. bread a bit hard) but the misses can be forgiven.  Service is terrific and the prices, while for the area maybe a tad high, still within most budgets for the quality.  One important note, they need (make that MUST!) update their Website so that Dinners are not disappointed by items on the website that are NOT on the menu.  Incidentally, my favorite dish - The Braised Beef is to die for!

"Hot Dog" is in the name and I am only going to Review the Hot Dogs.  Here I am going to "go against the grain" with a mediocre Review of a New Restaurant receiving mostly good Reviews.  Okay, so maybe I am a "Hot Dog Snob" from the East Coast, where everyone knows there is only one brand of Hot Dog that can stand up to being boiled instead of grilled. (The "Dirty Water Dog" is the Sabrett brand, in Natural Casing).  In fairness to this new location and because I love Hot Dogs I tried three varieties:                          With everything! (The Chicago way)                          With Mustard and Relish only (My favorite)                           Chile Cheese Dog  Let me say, the "Toppings" are terrific. The problem is with the Hot Dog itself. Far too mild, no beefy taste (Bordering on no taste), overwhelmed by the toppings and with very little "snap" when biting into it.  Probably in the minority, but just NOT as good as the size of the Restaurant and the reputation would indicate.  Ted's is still the "Hot Dog Of Choice" in Phoenix and they are from Buffalo, New York.   Willing to venture to Maricopa for the BEST BOILED HOT DOGS EVER (Sabrett)? If so, go to Al's Dogs located next to O'Reilly Auto Parts on John Wayne in Maricopa. Better call first to be certain they are open: (520) 357-3647

I am abandoning my "Two Visits For A Good Review" policy for this little jewel of a "Pho Phind!"  Since two of my three favorite "Pho Restaurants" have closed (Dragonfly in Mesa and Pho Ao Sen, also in Mesa, now Pho Number One and NOT very good) I have been left with only Pho Van in Chandler as my only "go to for Pho" Restaurant.  Okay, so you have to overlook the seedy, bordering on dilapidated, interior of the Restaurant (assume it was left that way by the previous Chinese Restaurant tenant) but if you do you will be treated to a PHABULOUS BOWL OF PHO!  Pho of this quality should be attracting far more than the three Diners present on a Saturday evening at 7 PM. Very hard to find Pho as good as this and I know, I have been to most ALL of the "Pho Joints" in Phoenix and the East Valley.  Spring Rolls are no better than others, but here the PHO IS THE STAR!  My fellow diners (Pho Phanatics as well!) agreed as to the quality of this Pho. This is just plain GREAT PHO!  I will give it only Four Stars because of the interior of the Restaurant, but the Pho is definitely Five Stars!  Incidentally, if you go during the day, you can also pick up something from the Best of Europe Meats and Deli in the same Shopping Center.

In keeping with my "Review Strategy" (Good review after a minimum of two visits - NOT so good Review after only one visit, as I am NOT going back) I am VERY dissapointed  to have to write this Review, as I looked forward to Café Daniel with GREAT ANTICIPATION, based on so many stellar Reviews here.  To say this was an underwhelming dinner experience would be an understatement. The Restaurant is quite lovely and the menu so promising. I had two dishes, which were presented quite nicely. The problem? Each dish lacked taste, although they were certainly unique enough . NOT at all certain if Café Daniel is French or Italian, but seems to have failed on each count. Pate had very nice texture but was virtually tasteless. Candidly, I have enjoyed Farmers Liverwurst more! The stuffed  figs? OMG, dried would be an understatement. Try eating the sole of your shoe!  One note regarding The Proprietor, who as previous Reviewers had mentioned, was in attendance. With only five tables active he managed to visit each of the other four tables, but apparently an older man dining alone was of no interest to him. NOT A WORD.  Sorry to be so negative.

Actually my second visit. On my first they were profusely apologetic saying that "we are out of food." On this visit, although about the same time (1:30 PM), they had ample food.  Very cute, nicely redone place with friendly service, obviously interested Cooks or Preparers and a great reputation for fabulous bread.  Unfortunately, it turns out to be another in a series or recent disappointments, but in this case only a  minor disappointment.  First, let me say that the ingredients are all here, I believe. Especially the creativity of putting ingredients together in an unusual and attractive manner. It just needs some "tweaking," including a look at their pricing structure for their location. Otherwise, I worry about their long-term viability. I will divide my Review into:                                           The good - The Bad - The Ugly  THE GOOD: As mentioned their ingredients are pretty terrific. The Prosciutto and Parmesan on my sandwich were quite wonderful and certainly a combination I never would have thought of. The Bean Soup was AMAZING with wonderful taste, although the beans could have been not quite so hard. The STAFF is FABULOUS! At no time did the young woman taking orders and checking on diners not have a broad smile on her face. Wonderful and warm! There is obvious pride on display here.  THE BAD: NOT nearly enough of the main ingredients on the sandwich! In order to actually taste the Prosciutto and Parmesan I had to take some off of the sandwich. The chosen bread for the sandwich was the Chibata and that might NOT have been the best choice. The attending salad (with the sandwich) was nothing special, although the pickled carrots were very well done, although sparse.  THE UGLY: For the price point (almost $!6.00 plus tip for lunch!) plastic utensils and a tiny Styrofoam soup bowl have got  to go! They should invest in a dishwasher in order to be first class with silver and china, NOT to mention they will be "Greener!"  The price ($5) for the miniscule portion of soup (far less than a teacup!) can be raised, given the quality I tasted, with a bigger portion. The Price of Sandwiches can and should be lowered a bit (Under $9) with more of the important ingredients and served without a salad. Can/should have a "Side Salad" with more ingredients, which seems to be their specialty, and priced separately.  Quality is 4  1/2 Stars and it is obvious they care about quality. The drawbacks (price, disposables, improper portions and proportions) lower their overall score but there is GREAT promise here! I will be back!  I want badly for this dinning alternative to make it here as I am in this exact location almost five days a week. I hope they do, but they should consider some small changes to make it even a better experience.

I was a fan of their Prime Rib, which is not yet available at this new venue.  Pleasant enough surrounding for BBQ with ordering from a knowledgeable young girl and delivery to your table.  The owner does circulate, which is a nice touch.  Based on previous Reviews I tried the "Burnt Ends" and they had good (NOT excellent) flavor. I thought the portion was small and their "sides" are ridiculously small and priced much too high, which seems to be the "norm" for BBQ Restaurants. All in all NOT a bargain and for the price would expect significantly better.   All in all will NOT try again, unless he starts serving the same Prime Rib he did at his long standing location on Scottsdale Road.

With great reluctance I write this Review as I visited with such high hopes.  Just a word about the "Service." Our Waitress was sensational and I could see her and others interfacing with Customers and they seemed equally as tuned in.  Unfortunately the food did NOT measure up to these folks stellar  service. I never reviewed Beckett's Table because I felt I was in the minority and maybe just hit it on a bad night (won't go back there either) but now a second of his Restaurants shows poorly to me and I can't imagine how others have given such raving Reviews.  I visited with a native New Orlinian and he, like I was sorely disappointed. We tried:  * Fried Green Tomatoes with Pimento Cheese - lacked taste and was clearly overcooked. The "Gold Standard" in Phoenix is certainly Short Leash Sit and Stay and these didn't even come close.  * Fried Okra - Fresh is the best thing I can say about it. The batter was fired "hard" and wasn't pleasant to eat  * Shrimp Po Boy - NOT even close to what one would expect, plus a small portion. (Old bad joke, "the food was bad but there was a lot of it!") Chef should take a trip to Pappadeux's, with certainly the best Po Boys in Phoenix that I have had.  All in all, will NOT go back even though my inclination, based on other Reviews is to try it one more time. Too many great alternatives!
