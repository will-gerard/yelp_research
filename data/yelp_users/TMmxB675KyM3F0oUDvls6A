I had an independent shop and we sent all of our GMC and Cadillac warranty work to Karen Parker.  Karen is experienced and always took care of our (collective) client within a reasonable time.  I found her to be professional and knowledgeable about the mechanical aspects of GMC and Cadillac products.  I can tell you this.......DO NOT under any circumstances take your car to Earnhardt Chandler Cadillac on 202 and Gilbert.  I hear Earnhardt in Scottsdale is good but not handy for us SE Valley peeps.

I used to be a huge Danny's fan.  Last couple of trips the washes have been less than stellar but what is more concerning is the rude behavior of the workers on the finish line.  Whistling when an attractive woman comes out to the car pick up area, shouting back and forth at each other in Spanish and shouting out in Spanish the tip amount a customer gives.  All bad, management needs to take notice.  I have been going to Classic Car Spa lately and have had much better experiences.

Had the chicken, cashew kale salad it was very good. Service is excellent, a little pricey for what it is.  The best thing is the water....I don't know what they do to it but it's really good, comes in a frosted glass with no ice.

I'm a novice gun owner, I signed up for a conceal carry permit class and it has been fantastic.  J.R. Is the instructor, it is very informative on many aspects of gun safety, law, operation, etc.  The environment is comfortable and the material presented in an interesting manner.  All walks of society in the class, it is suited for all levels of knowledge/experience in a non-threatening/judgemental environment.  Highly recommend to anyone considering a class or anyone who owns a gun who wants to learn more.

We have been using Scott for YEARS, he is awesome!   Can't believe he only has 2 Yelps, c'mon Yelpers!  Seriously, great guy, great service, reliable and trustworthy.  Half the time we just leave the key and a check under the door mat.  Not the cheapest but definitely the best!!!

Usually fantastic, but disappointing for takeout the day after Thanksgiving.  My salad was mushy (congealed) and obviously made "several" days prior.  They also forgot part of our order.

Came for lunch, the service and food were excellent.  Wife had a salad, I had the club and you could tell the ingredients were high quality and the food was well prepared.

These guys are awesome, they're honest.  If they come to your house to service your HVAC system they actually "service your system" (shocking).  I was a commercial construction executive for almost 20 years and I've seen A LOT of shady stuff.    ********If you see an ad for a low cost ($50 or less) service special RUN......RUN AWAY from that company as fast as you can!******  Here's how these guys work......their technicians are on 100% commission, if he doesn't sell you "something" he doesn't get paid.  If he doesn't consistently sell customers "something" he gets fired.  No company can afford to come to your house for free (do you really think you can trust them?). A company can't even be profitable having a technician drive a van to your house for $49 and be profitable. For $49 they're not "servicing" anything, they're just visually looking for things to sell you (see 100% commission above).  So don't fall for that BS!    Go with someone you can trust.....Efficiency Mechanical.

These guys were referred to me back in 1999 when I had them install an opener on my 3rd door.  Great job, have had them or a couple times to fix some things.  I have referred them numerous times always with good results.

If you want your car fixed right, with good parts, with no "up-selling" of fluff services for a fair price this is your shop.

Terrible. The vacuum guy lit up a smoke right before he was going to vacuum my car.  Them they charged me $4 for "something", I still don't know WTF it was.  The manager asked an employee if he had seen "the stripper pole" clearly audible to me sitting 40 feet away.  You can't make this stuff up!    The guys on the end of the line were pretty good so I tipped them (not like I usually do) but I won't be back.

We got the family deal last night (pizza, wings, garlic knots). It was plenty of food for a family of 4 and everything was very good.  Sal was holding court as usual and there were lots of hard working, friendly young people bustling around. Food was hot and ready for pick up as promised. Will be back.

I opened several Schwab accounts in the last 90-days and I have been very impressed with the staff and how Schwab operates.  I'm a "Boglehead" (Index Investor) at heart, Schwab has welcomed and has embraced this, I have not been pressured to invest in actively managed funds.   Danny Bhavsar, Client Relations VP, has been particularly helpful and has earned my trust.  Danny helped me transition funds from numerous other investment firms to multiple Schwab accounts of various types (IRA, Roth, Brokerage, CD's).   Schwab has a really cool tool that calculates the clients goals and risk tolerance then invests those funds for a VERY LOW expense ration. It's like a target date fund, it's called "Intelligent Portfolios". It's the George Foreman of investing "set it and forget it", just don't forget to keep putting your money in!  I love Schwab Bank, it has free checks, free bill pay, use any ATM, and it's linked directly to my brokerage accounts.  Schwab bank is primarily online but there is a brick and mortar branch 5 miles away for the 1-2 times per year I need to actually go to the bank. Their app is very robust and easy to use.  You can deposit checks, transfer money, and see your investments and checking account all at a glance.

I had a very pleasant experience with Jack Callaghan in Internet Sales.  I inquired about a car, received a response within a couple of hours.  Made an appointment with Jack to test drive the car (and another).  We couldn't come to a deal but I was really impressed by Jack and all of the staff.  Very low pressure, no running back to the tower or stall tactics.  I was in and out with 2 test drives in about an hour.

My mother was in a fender bender and Chapman did the repairs.  She was very pleased with everyone she interacted with, particularly Jorge Rivera.  The workmanship appears to be top notch, their customer service certainly was.

The food here is good, the staff is friendly, the beer is cold.  What else do you want in a neighborhood Italian joint?  Oh......and they have Peroni on tap!!

I'm giving two stars because it was dirt cheap on a Groupon but the quality of the wash they did on my wife's Lexus was not very good.  I had to spend 10-15 minutes getting the numerous spots they totally missed.  Wheels were not done very well either.  No way I would take my car there.

I brought my 2013 CTS-V to Cordes for Stage 1 mods.  I had been out of "the game" for 3 years and all the faces had changed.  It's a strange feeling handing the keys to a $70k car to a complete stranger who's going to modify it.....there are no guarantees there has to be confidence and trust.  Guys I knew recommended Cordes and I am totally satisfied.  Good communication, good price, quality work and of course......results.  Thanks Joe

We went twice and had okay-poor experiences both times and haven't been back.  Both times the hostesses seemed generally uninterested and couldn't even manage a smile.  Both times the service at the bar was slow, I get it when the bar is busy but you have to acknowledge a customer when they arrive at the bar; ie, "I see you, I'll be right with you".  The food was okay, the fish and shrimp tacos were good, the chicken tacos had no flavor and everything is pretty pricey for what you get.  I did not like their signature drinks (maybe it's just my taste) they were very sweet and had the consistency of pur√©ed fruit.

First time ordering.  We had a pizza (half V's 3 meat/half bianco) wings and garlic knots and everything was really good.   We will order again for sure!

Tucked in a retail center on the SE corner of Warner and Cooper the best Thai food I've had in a long time.  The Mussamun and Panang Curry are our favorites.

Overall really happy. Bought the Groupon, tested it out with my wife's Lexus GS350 and they did a good job so I brought my CTS-V in and both were well worth the money.  I really like the fact that is didn't get the hard sale at the POS, they asked me if I wanted this and that, I said no and that was it.  WAAAAAAAY better than Francis and Sons!

Really good.  My wife is from Seattle so she rarely wants to go for seafood in AZ but friends told us High Tide was good so we tried it.  Huge portions (fish and chips, shrimp cocktail, crab cake, calamari).  Priced very well (especially in happy hour), Jenny was out server she was very friendly and engaging.  The owner was walking around checking on customers and knew many, this is a really nice touch we enjoyed talking with him and could tell he is passionate about his business,  customers and employees.  We will definitely be back.

Zero stars......  So....my Cadillac friends warned me not to take my car to Chandler Cadillac (Earnhardt).  I gave them a try anyway because it was just a couple of trim issues Recaro seat track broke and I had a DRL out.  Drop off my 2013 CTS-V (which is modified) and say "no test drive, no wash please" also sent it in an email!  Kudos to the Service advisor as he puts this on the ticket and it's on my invoice so I know he did his part but someone in the back wasn't listening.    Pick up the car, invoice shows in/out miles as the same BUT the out miles are actually 6 higher than when I dropped it off. (I took video of the drop off and pick up with the ODO in the background). I went back in but my advisor was not there nor was service manager so I sent them an email explaining what happened in a very calm tone because I know they (likely) didn't drive the car.  Asked them to find out what happened and call me and let me know what they were going to do to make it right.    Five days have gone by and I have heard nothing.....and my DRL is still out.    I have used Karen at Coulter Cadillac in the past and she's good, it's just these guys are right next to my house so I gave them a chance.  This is my second CTS-V, I flip my cars every couple of years.  I'm not going back, for service or when I buy my 2016 CTS-V

I can't believe they brought back the old Minder Binders!  If you were of (or close to) drinking age in the 70's, 80's or early 90's in Tempe then you remember this place!  Great mix of the old and some new.
