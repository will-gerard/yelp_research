Favorite restaurant in AZ.  Their filet mignon is amazing!  My daughter has food allergies and the wait staff is so wonderful, they will literally bring me ingredient labels even going as far as to cut the label off a box for me so I can read it myself.  Love their brownie al a mode too!! Omg!!

I have been coming to this place for years. I have been massaged by about 20 different people and all of them are amazing!! I really like Jennifer A LOT. The prices are unbeatable and they always do something a little extra.(hot stone, warm towel or cooling eye mask) I just love this place. Also, the owner is involved and you see him on site quite a bit which I think is great. The staff also seems to enjoy working there.

I just love this Arby's!  My daughter has a serious food allergy and they are always so accommodating! They change their gloves before making my daughter's sandwich and customize her order. Surprisingly, this is one of the few places we trust for her to eat. Very clean location and great service too!

Yummy pizza.  Great service and their pizza cookie with ice cream is awesome. The pan pizza takes 45 minutes or so to cook so if that's your thing be sure to call and order ahead! :)

This place was pretty darn good!  The crab puffs were my favorite omg! The mushroom chicken and orange chicken were very good.  The beef broccoli ok.  We were short one crab puff though. The egg drop soup was a little too thick for my liking.  Delivery guy was fast.  We will definitely be eating there again!!

Decided to treat myself to a pedicure... Sadly dissapointed.  My big toe nail was cut really short and was cut diagonally.  I wouldn't even cut my own toe nails like that. I expect a professional to make my nails look good. Also, she didn't spend a lot of time doing the rough scrubby thing on the bottoms of my feet,  that's my favorite part.  Positives: salon was clean and had good ambiance.  The foot massage was awesome and my lady spent a lot of time on my massage.
