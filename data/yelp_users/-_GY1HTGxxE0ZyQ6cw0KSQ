I'm shocked to see that this place has an average of 4 stars!! This place sucked. We ordered the crab puffs, sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and egg drop soup. Everything was gross. The crab puffs were soggy and burnt, the sweet and sour chicken was somewhat decent but the sauce was sooo watered down. The fried rice was so greasy and had a weird flavor, and the egg drop soup was by far the worst. It tasted like someone used leftover water from cleaning dishes to make it. It was so nasty. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT reccommend this place.

Nothing but totally painful experiences. First time I went, I just wanted to get antibiotics for an infected tooth.already in excruciating pain, they decided to take it upon themselves without asking me, to do this torturous evaluation of my whole mouth to check my bone density by sticking needles under my gums over and under every tooth. I'm already in pain from my infection and just wanted to get out of there to get my antibiotics. It turned into an hour and a  half ordeal. I left with my infection pulsating more, gums sore and bleeding everywhere, which caused me to get  canker sores in a bout 2 places because of all the needle damage. Then, stupid me, yesterday I went  back to get a root canal. I was desperate.  They gave me this whole shpeel about how they "Don't mess around with pain, and not to worry cuz they will totally numb me so I wont feel a thing." It was the worst root canal experience of my life!!! My infection had come back, which wasn't their fault, and  because of that, the Novocaine didn't work, and I had to have about 3 time more injections to stop the pain. These people knew I had a possibility of infection, and didnt warn me that the Novocaine might not be as effective and it would be a lot more painful. They decided to tell me after they started the procedure once I was almost in tears telling them that the Novocaine wasn't working.  That wasn't  the worst part.  I was sitting there for about 3 hours, and once I get home, my tooth already starts throbbing even though my whole face is still completely numb. By the time it wore off, like 7 hours later, I realize the temporary crown is HUGE, and EXTREMELY ROUGH!! My tongue was completely raw already (and I am just expecting more canker sores from that), but I had to file the tooth down myself with a 3 way nail buffer just to get it smooth enough so it wouldn't serrate my tongue any further. I've  never had a worse job done and been in such extreme pain. I went to mexico years ago to get a root canal AND a bridge, and It was 100 times better of an experience than what I went through yesterday. I know root canals aren't painless, but this by far was done with extreme carelessness and sloppiness. I do not recommend this place at all. Once I get my crown, which I'm terrified of, I'm never going back.

Wow! I was soooo impressed with the quality of Eco King!! Super friendly, informative and efficient.  I had pretty dirty carpets; pet stains, juice, wine spills, and just really dirty high traffic areas.To the point of embarrassment!  I wanted all of my first floor done. I had my carpets cleaned by a company 3 years ago and the results just didn't last at all. In fact , the moisture and cleaner that they left in my pad only brought the stains out  even over time and made them look awful.  Eco Kings method was different and the tech explained everything to me in great detail. I wasn't sure what to expect as far as how clean it would get, but I thought his prices were so amazing, I thought why not. He said that if it came out before, it would come out again, and that he could get the residue from the old cleaner out as well.  I was a bit skeptical, but his results blew me away. They were even cleaner than when I got them done the first time!! It is not worth your money to spend on steam cleaning. There is no difference! I will 100% be using Eco King again and again!! Thank you!!
