I despise going to this Walgreens. There is always a wait of at least five minutes to even talk to someone. Today was the last straw. I was told by one employee in order to drop off my Rx I had to have my ID. I drove home to grab it, not happy about the situation because I have NEVER had to have my ID to just drop off a RX. When I came back with my ID to drop off the RX I wasn't even asked for my ID by the new employee assisting me. Didn't complain, just needed them filled so I could get home and rest and recover from sinusitis and the flu. All in all though a Ridiculous waste of my time. I dropped off the RX and was told 30-35 minutes. What happened to 20 minute wait times? An hour later I received a text stating it was ready for pick up. What happened to the time frame?  Went to pick up my RX. Had to wait in line although no one was in line or at the counter being helped. When the friendly gentlemen (although the one who sent me home to get my ID when I didn't need it) finally started looking for my 3 RXs for pick up it took him another few minutes. He looked frantic trying to find a misplaced one. You could tell he was over worked and they were obviously understaffed. He finally found the last RX (how they misplaced one from the other two in an hours time is beyond me). After ringing me up he explained how to use the medications. The guy had the hardest time even finishing a sentence. You could tell his mind was on the other 30 things he was behind in doing. Walgreens, my advice to you is to learn how to staff correctly. Oh, I forgot to mention, when I finally walked out of the store there was 7 people in the pharmacy line and about 15 in the front 2 checkouts. Done with this place

I visited Dr. Doug for the first time yesterday. Was greeted with a warm smile and hello. The assistant immediately came and got me to take me back. She took an extensive set of X-rays and moments later Dr Doug came in. Super easy to talk to, Down to earth and obviously has mastered his craft. After talking to me (just to get to know me) he did a gum pressure check and checked my teeth. He then brought my X-rays onto the tv hanging in front of me and Did a wonderful job explaining the anatomy of the teeth and broke the news (quite nicely) I had my first cavity of my life. I was worried about a couple other things which after we discussed, he mentioned some no to low cost solutions to. Today I went back in and got a cleaning done by Darla (the hygenist).She talked me through everything she was doing and was really gentle. She took a whole hour to do the cleaning. Best cleaning I have had in my life! I had been hesitant to try a new dentist since moving here from California, where I had the same dentist for 25 years, but am SO glad to have found this office. Highly recommend them!

Jesse came out today and sprayed our condo for scorpions. He was super friendly and obviously knew what he was talking about. Explained many solutions for our horrible scorpion problem. Great price as well! I'm excited to see the results but Jesse was awesome.

A month later and we have had only one scorpion since the spraying! And it was dead already  couldn't be happier and would recommend this company/spray to anyone with scorpion problems.
