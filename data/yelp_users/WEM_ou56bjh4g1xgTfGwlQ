Beautiful view, amazing service from Lenny and delectable food. A great way to celebrate my fiancees birthday. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.

They have no care for timelines. Customer service is horrible. Took my bridesmaid here to look at dresses. We found one we loved and ordered it in April. They said it would be 16 weeks which was longer than it would take for my wedding dress  (from Azteca). But it would arrive in August which was plenty of time for my October wedding. We are now 30 days out and still no dress. She has called every week for the last month and they have no answers. They could care less if it arrives in time. We now have to shop for a new dress. As a previous event planner and now a stressed bride I would never recommend this shop.

Great birthday gift!  Instructor was very knowledgable and answered all my questions.  I would highly recommend Turf Soaring School.

Hilton brands have fallen down. Won't book here again. Stayed at one for my wedding and they didn't clean the room before we can back. Now I arrive to a checkin line that hasn't moved. Done with Hilton.

Surprised my boyfriend with a hot air balloon ride on a Saturday morning.  I did a lot of research and read lots of reviews. Hot Air Expeditions had the best reviews.  It was all that I expected it to be.  Tom was our driver and he had a great personality.  I have lived here since I was 3 and my boyfriend and I learned a lot about the valley during our ride with Tom.  We had our first stop to see if the winds were good.  Then we watched as lots of balloonists departed (like being a storm chaser....very cool) to go to Thunder Alley.  They were all on the hunt for the right spot.  Patrick was our Pilot.  He had over 20 years experience and hundreds (if not more) flight hours.  He also had a great personality, was funny and enjoyed his job.  He explained a lot to us and also gave us an education on the Valley and what we were seeing and how ballooning worked.  It was a very peaceful and calm experience.  My boyfriend really enjoyed himself.  Our landing was top notch.  Then we had a wonderful champagne breakfast in the desert.  Vincents on Camelback is the restaurant this amazing food comes from.  No other company in the valley offers this amazing breakfast.  I'm a foodie...trust me on this.  In addition, our entire group sang Happy Birthday to my boyfriend.  It was a one of a kind experience for him.  As a hint, check in on Yelp before your flight and get a free champagne glass at the end.  If you want to take a balloon ride in the valley this is the company you want to use.  Ask for Tom and Patrick and you won't be disappointed.

They have an amazing happy hour.  Try the grown up peach iced tea, a baguette, and the rice bowl (with our without chicken).  Love the building they transformed as well!

Slowest Starbucks in history no matter how many people they have working. The best Starbucks in the area is at the frys at 59th or safeway at 67th. If the kiosks could give the reward drinks I would never have to go to a store again.

My new favorite go to Indian restaurant. They offer papadom, Indian crackers which are gluten free. The madrasi lamb was delicious but I should have asked for a spice level of hot. The basmati rice had good flavor. They offer more of the authentic Indian dishes. The staff was very friendly and offered good customer service.

The best I have had.

New Owners really take pride in their food and restaurant. Great service, tasty food. Lamb dishes are my favorite but it is all fantastic. Don't miss this gem of a family owned restaurant.

Website indicates breakfast scrambles can be gf. Despite saying I'm gf so no toast just potatoes and fruit. They bring toast with my meal (touching my food) and cold potatoes. It goes on. I won't be back. Before we left they did come and apologize and gave us $10 in coupons.

I am a foodie and I can say that this is the best pizza in the Valley.  It is exactly like the pizza you get in Italy.  The crust is crispy, the sauce is a beautiful balance of seasoning and tomatoes, the sauce to cheese to toppings ratio is perfect, and the price is just right.  If you don't live in the West Valley you will want to make the drive for this Sicilian owned family pizzeria.

Great animal hospital that is great with animals but they also have affordable no interest payment plans.  As you know taking care of animals can be costly and most clinics don't provide this service to customers.  As someone who worked in the pet industry and knows how the Banfield's of the world operate and charge I would highly recommend this hospital.

Hadn't ordered Pizza Hut in a long time thought I would give it a try again because it was close and I had three teenagers to feed. Ordered online and waited extra time to pick up because this location has never had any pizza I ordered ready on time. Arrived and my order was ready but incorrect. Plus found out that even if you order two orders of wings they charge you 50 cents for each ranch. They don't give one or two anymore. Everywhere else does. Guess this is how they have to recoup money plus some for all the $10 pizzas.   My options for the incorrect order: wait 10 minutes for another correct pizza while the rest of my order sits or 2) a credit for next time. Considering I was reluctant to order to begin with plus had to pay for ranch I opted for neither. I can get a $10 pizza from Oggies thanks to yelp. Better pizza, same price, and I don't pay for ranch.   In business little things become big things in regards to customer perception and "sorry I don't make the rules" even in an apologetic and innocent wish i could help way, doesn't make me a repeat customer.

I am a foodie and I don't often repeat restaurants unless they are really amazing.  I have maybe a dozen in the valley I go back to.  This is one of those places.  Everything is so amazing that now when I go I just tell them to bring me anything on the menu.  Beet salad that is pretty close to Woflgang Pucks Spago beet salad, Shrimp and grits are delish (and I am a pretty strict judge of grits), short ribs that make you want to lick the plate, and oh the desserts.  Fig & Pecan pie with cream cheese ice cream will make you want to come back just to have dessert as the entree.

"Unbelievably WOW" doesn't even begin to explain the exceptional meal and service we received at Alchemy Restaurant.   We were staying at CopperWynd for a birthday stay-cation and had made reservations for Alchemy, Saturday evening.  This was to be our first dining experience there.  We had a minor hiccup with pool service that day and therefore moved up our reservation due to hunger.  The manager was extremely apologetic for our experience and went above and beyond to make things right.  This is unheard of in todays hospitality environment.  We weren't sure what to expect but the meal was absolutely mouth watering and exquisite.  We enjoyed a superb glass of malbec as we savored the best calamari I have ever eaten.  They get this appetizer just perfect.  It is not over fried and is topped with picante sweet peppers.  We then enjoyed the Fall Harvest Salad and the Bacon Caesar Salad.  These salads are not small at all.  They could be a meal in itself.  Both were simply full of flavor and refreshing.  We then both enjoyed their special of the evening a chimichurri seasoned steak with garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini.  The steak was perfectly cooked to our liking  and had the right amount of seasoning.  It made my mouth water.  I couldn't finish mine because it was so much food.  Then to top it all off the manager sent over 3 desserts.  A creme brûlée, a flour less chocolate cake and mint chocolate chip ice cream.  I have never felt so full and satisfied from a meal.  Every course had amazing flavor and was done perfectly.  The management, chef and staff get this restaurant right.  I would highly recommend Alchemy to anyone visiting the valley.  You won't regret eating here.  In fact you will regret not knowing about it earlier.  And the view by the windows is beautiful.  As a tip you may want to request window seating in your reservation.  Thank you Alchemy for making our experience so memorable.  We will be back with others in tow.

First time here on my birthday.  Love that they let me use my free appetizer and free dessert on the same visit.  Great Happy Hour menu with too die for chicken wings.  A great spicy and zesty taste to them.  The Arcadia salad is light and filling (probably because I ate 7 chicken wings before).  But seriously very good flavor.  Side of green chile mac n cheese which you can get as a meal was good but could have used a bit more of a kick.    Love the history of the building and like that it is not very noisy.

My boyfriend and I frequent here for brunch on Sundays.  Good made to order omelets, $3 bloody marys and mimosas (and sometimes billini's) and other items such as belgium waffles, two egg breakfast with potatoes, eggs benedict and the best thing to go with all of them...bettys scalloped potatoes (low in carbs and calories of course).  JT one of the bartenders works Friday and Sunday's is a favorite of the locals.

New owner understands customer service, quality food and restaurant business. BACK ON OUR LIST! We stopped coming because the previous owners took this from the neighborhood hang out with good food at a competitive price to poor food, high prices and no care for the customer. The new owner is revamping the menu, moving back to reasonable prices, quality customer service and a great vibe. If you haven't been in you need to. We will be coming back again!!!

I can't even give this place a single star but yelp makes me to write a review. New ownership has been a downgrade.  Last time food was cold, this time the wrong food which I sent back. My waiter later asks me if I wanted something new after my boyfriend was done. I talk to manager and she tells me I'm the only one that complained about the waiter and they are making changes to become a sports bar to bring in customers. Can't bring in new customers with bad food and poor service and bad attitudes. Won't be back.

The New Serenity Spa gets it right. From the great prices, customer service and services you can't go wrong. The ownership truly understands what taking care of clients means. This belief is from the top down. A great experience. I recommend the serenity facial!  Will be back for another one and will try the massage services and yoga. Leaving relaxed and centered.

Disappointing they offer no gluten free options. Most places today, especially health conscious restaurants, offer a few salad dressings etc. when I asked they replied "we are an open kitchen and can't Guarantee anything". I asked what the ingredients were and I got a blank stare and "this one might be ok but we really don't have anything to offer you". Too bad.  Needless to say we left.

Serendipity of fabulous food, wine and staff. It was serendipitous that I had driven by this restaurant a few times on my way home from work when traffic was less than desirable. I thought to myself "I bet that place is really good" and I made a note in my phone. I understand they had been in a previous location but I had never been to their previous location. Tonight we enjoyed our first meal here. This house turned restaurant has great character, history and warmth. We savored the escargot and steak tar tar. The Roquefort salad had amazing flavor. We delighted in the perfectly blended flavors of the halibut with seaweed, scallops with cauliflower and salad and the Moroccan lamb shank with cous cous. All enjoyed with a wonderful super Tuscan wine. The staff is very much a team and provides great service. They also have a fabulous outdoor area that we will enjoy in the spring. The owner has done a superb job of turning this old house into a delightful restaurant full of flavor and great service.  Hidden gem!

I have used LRW for a few years now. I had just about given up on protein powders due to bad taste, or them being high in sugar and/or being soy based. Each LRW version (meal replacement, the only whey or gluten free wheyvia) is made with quality ingredients. No matter which one you choose they taste amazing, mix completely in water (no clumps just smooth creamy goodness) and make achieving your goals easier. My fiancé uses the meal replacement. I use the wheyvia because I am gluten free. My son uses the only whey and is a true believer that it has helped him in his lifting and training. He was using a Costco brand before. He says there is a big difference in the ingredients and formula. If you have been looking for the right protein for you...look no further.

New management needs a little more time to work it out. My excitement about being able to return to Bettys Nosh or the new "Nosh" was cut short. New management is getting some things right. However my second breakfast here was anything but worth the price. A very greasy veggie omelet for $10, $2 for "fruit", well at least the cantaloupe and pineapple I got, and bitter coffee. My husbands scalloped potatoes did not look appetizing so for now I would say choose the other potatoes. Others seemed to enjoy the chicken and waffle. And I hear the crab cake Benedict is great. The positive...although the bellinis went from $3 to $4, JT is the best bartender and really the reason anyone comes to The Nosh. He makes a mean Bloody Mary too. Improvements to be made but it is still early for new management and hopefully they can get it right.

Adrianne is an amazing real estate agent with years of experience. She worked tirelessly to find us our home. We have referred her to several friends based on her work ethic, her solid negotiating skills, her amazing customer service and her keen understanding of markets in Arizona. She has helped several friends find homes that have moved from out of state and has helped one couple sell that home and buy a new home build. If you want someone working hard for you, want someone who will get to know you to find you the right home and someone you can trust then Adrianne is the realtor you have been looking for.
