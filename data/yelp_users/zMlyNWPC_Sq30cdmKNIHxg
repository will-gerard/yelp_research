A delightful spot for fresh, imaginative food.  I LOVE Nora's raspberry chicken salad and it's just one example of their delicious food.  They also cater and it's always a hit!

What a ripoff and poorly run restaurant. We can forgive the 20 minute wait to force you to shop in the gift shop. Then you can't sit near any animated characters because they are "slammed" but we can see plenty of open tables....translation...their staff can't handle a busy restaurant. We wait 45 minutes after ordering 2 salads,1 pasta dish and a child's menu item.  One visit by server in 45 minutes, and that was just to take order and deliver iced tea.  We ask a passing server to alert the manager who says " sorry...you are welcome to leave."  Poorly run restaurant. 65 minutes after we enter and we leave without eating. We won't be back!
