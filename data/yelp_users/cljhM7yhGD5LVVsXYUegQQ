Very bad service , poor leadership skills , the waiter was writing are order on a napkin, and was spaced out , might have been on Something!!!! He came to ask if we needed anything with food in his mouth chewing!!!!!!!!! took way to long to get our food  food was nasty tasting......never go to this place!!!
