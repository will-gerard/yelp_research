Probably the best customer service I've ever experienced, and the food was good too!   I went here with my brother tonight and the manager?? was so friendly and accommodating. He told us all about Sandela's mission and gave us recommendations for dinner. I had the Fiesta salad which was simple, but still good. Also got the Brazilian flatbread, Buffalo chx panini, and turkey pesto wrap for the family which all got great reviews!  Definitely going to go back here as they have tons of healthy, delicious options, and customer service is phenomenal!

Verde Salon is great! Easy scheduling and check in when I got there, and my stylist, Jenna, was awesome. I was a bit nervous about cutting over 10 inches off my hair, but Jenna was such a perfectionist and made me very at ease about it. She tied my hair in three tiny pony tails to cut so I could donate it, and before cutting she made sure I was totally ready. She took before and after shots, and hopefully they will be posted soon! I will definitely be visiting Jenna and Verde Salon again. Thanks for such a great experience!

I'm writing this as I wait for the shop manager to call me back. I called on Saturday regarding an issue I've had with my car despite it being at AAA two other times in the past two weeks. Joe told me that I would be able to reach the shop manager today, and yet when I called, I was told he wasn't in the shop and they didn't know when he would be back. That's beside the point.   Two Wednesdays ago my car died while I was driving it. I called AAA and they picked it up about 30min later and brought it to their shop. I did not hear from them until that Friday, despite calling and asking what the issue was. They quoted me $420 to change the fuel injector, spark plugs, and an oil change. Fair enough price.  Until the next morning when my car would not start again. Thinking they messed something up, I had it towed to them again, and did not hear back until that Monday. The starter went out, and this was "completely unrelated to the fuel injector and spark plugs." That was another $340 to repair. I was in tears, but I needed my car.  Not even five days later and my car is sputtering while driving. I smelled gas and the check engine light came on. Thankfully this time I was able to drive it to them. They are currently "diagnosing" the problem as I wait to speak with the shop manager as to why my car is not performing despite nearly $800 of repairs.   I do not recommend AAA, and I will not let them repair anything else on my car. After they tell me what they think is wrong, and I receive a full refund for the previous work done, I am bringing my car to another shop for repairs.

A little update for you all. Just spoke with the manager of the shop who informed me that now my other two fuel injectors are out and I will have to have them replaced at the tune of $211. When I asked why they didn't see the issue with the other fuel injectors upon first inspection, the manager said "My tech felt sorry for you and didn't want to make you pay for three fuel injector replacements." THEN, when I asked if the starter issue was possibly a mistake on their part (for not fixing the original issue entirely) the manager stated that it was MY fault the starter went out because I tried to start the car with the fuel injector out. Now I am to blame for them returning the car to me after not fixing the original issue and now I have to pay for further repairs?! I have yet to pay for the newest "repairs" and will be contacting corporate AAA and the better business bureau before they here from me again.
