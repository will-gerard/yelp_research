Horrible customer service, would not go back. There's definitely a lot of other places that I would rather go to that have greater selection and prices.

I must have a been here at least a hundred times that I remember and hundred more that I have completely lost due to alcohol induced amnesia. But every time I went the service was great and the food was good. Yes it's your basic Japanese cuisine but one thing that always brings me back is the Crazy Monkey. Try it you won't be disappointed.

If you love irish music, beer and liquor than this is your place. The food is good and the prices are average. Plus they are having promotions for their 13 year anniversary.

This is without a doubt the best sushi / teppan-yaki place that I've been to in Vegas. That said its also the most expensive one I've been to. If money is no object, I would definitely say Shibuya. FYI it was about $300 for two.

Two clubs, one cover and good drinks. I know most women don't like it b/c they have to pay too but guys have to pay cover pretty much anywhere. And no matter where someone starts the night, if they're in Scottsdale they normally end up here.

This place used to be so much better. Maybe thats why I was disappointed. Expensive drinks, insane drink refill wait time and .... do i need to add anything else

Great beer, really good food and no wait. Ok yes it was noon on a Sat but that can be hard to find any day of the week, at any time.

The wait for a squat rack is ridiculous, suggested they get some more but to no avail.
