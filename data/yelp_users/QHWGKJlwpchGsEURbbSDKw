I went here with my friend for lunch. The hostess (if that's what you'd call her) ignored the line of people to cash a tab for a server and didn't acknowledge us. I think everytime she sat someone down, she went in the back to stuff her face, because she took forever to come back. So finally when we thought we were going to be seated, she goes to cash another check and tells a waiter to seat us. He seats us right next to the men's restroom, so my friend went and asked the hostess if we could move and she said yeah sit wherever. Finally a server says he'll be with us, then a famale server takes our drink orders. It wasn't organized at all. Then my friend ordered a beer on tap and that didn't work. So she just ordered a bottle which was $5.00. I ordered the chili cheese fries. The chili came on the side, which I was glad for. It was pretty gross, it tasted like they put sweet bbq sauce in it and it's called volcano yeah right. I was very disappointed and will not return here. If you like crappy service and frozen, reheated food then go for it.

I love coming here for lunch. It's fun to get the bruschetta and a cheese board to share. The panini's are my favorite around. I usually order half a panini and a salad or soup, depending on what the soup of the day is. The Italian Picnic salad is really good. You really can't go wrong with anything you order. Everything is fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is cool and you can chill out, have some wine and enjoy the food. It's a great place to meet friends and hang out for awhile.

This place has the best donuts in the valley. I grew in Southern Cali and there are an abundance of locally owned shops there. It is a struggle to find a good quality donut shop around here. They are few and far between. I don't like DD and KK is played out. I was heading in that direction and decided to give it a try. These are the best donuts I have found in the valley. The prices are great as is the selection. I like that they have a drive thru, which make it very convenient and fast. The Apple Fritter was crispy and delicious. The maple bar is soft and the maple icing is soooo good. You can tell these are fresh donuts as they are soft and fresh. These are so good that I would get up early on the weekend just to go there and get the best selection before the rush came and obliterated them. Love it!!!

This has been my favorite brand of iced tea since I tried it 10 years ago. Many restaurants use this brand and it's always good. I initially purchased the iced tea at AJ's fine foods. When I found out there was a store located at the headquarters in Scottsdale, I had to check it out. The teas are to the left when you walk in. I didn't know that they also sell a large selection of hot teas. They usually have 2 iced teas already brewed and there are hard logo'd plastic cups that you can take to go. While I was there a couple of employees from the surrounding area came in to get their refill of iced tea. I asked the receptionist what a certain hot tea tasted like and she said I could try whatever hot tea I wanted to. The prices are great and better than the area retail stores. I usually stock up when I'm in the area. If you like tea, I suggest you stop by so you can taste and discover the variety offered.

The food here is delicious! There is so much flavor and different textures in the food. I often order my usual, the Spinach Herb burger with lentil soup to go. It is perfect every time. I always get the cinnamon iced tea which is really good.  I've also had the Spanikopita and  the veggie stir fry. Both were amazing!

Simple scrumptious. I love Cibo. I've been there for lunch a couple of time and the best thing is the dough. The sandwiches are so good. I recently went there for dinner. We sat outside and  there were plenty of heaters to keep you warm. It was nice because there was live music and the atmosphere was lovely. The pizza is my favorite. I think it's way better that Pizza Bianco. The selection is far greater, the staff is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is welcoming. I love that the outside dining area is smoke-free. This is one of my favorite places to go. The crepes are amazing. We ordered the banana & nutella crepe and added strawberries on top. This is the kind of place where you can enjoy yourself and relax. You don't feel rushed to leave.

Oh FEZ I love you. I ordered the harissa fries and a black bean burger with avocado. Both were outstanding! The service is great and there are many tantalizing choices that you just can't get anywhere else.

I hadn't been here in awhile  and decided to go for breakfast. I ordered the spicy Chipotle egg sandwich without the sausage. It was delicious. The eggs were done perfect and the spicy chipotle sauce was divine. It has sun dried tomatoes, feta and spinach as well. I loved it. My husband ordered the Sausage and egg sandwich and said it was alright. I let him try mine and he said he'd get it next time. The brioche roll is buttery and light. There is so much flavor it this sandwich. I have nothing but great things to say.

The pizza is good. The customer is what is lacking. Hey if you want to order a pizza online and pick it up, make sure you check periodically to see if it is ready. I waited 36 minutes for my pizza which was in the warming oven. He response I got was ,"oh I guess it got lost". Thanks for wasting my lunchtime Zpizza.

I went ere for lunch with my husband. He ordered the half club sandwich on flatbread and broccoli cheddar soup. I ordered the half Salami pesto and goat cheese on sourdough with soup. Everything was wonderful. Everything is fresh and tasty. It's a little hidden but definitely worth trying. I'll be going back to try breakfast.

I like to support local businesses and stay away from the overpriced chain eateries. I really like this place. The Cafe Roma is my favorite drink. It has dark chocolate, caramel & prailine. Sometimes I get it iced and then blended. The tea selection is great. I've also tried the gelato and enjoyed that as well. The breakfast sandwiches are also really good. The service is lacking at times, but I like the overall atmosphere and don't mind. This place doesn't have the rushed feeling, like other places do.

I have been getting my facials and microdermabrasions from here for about five years. The prices are great and I like that the instructor comes in to go over the skin analysis with the student. I would say that if you haven't had a skin treatment, this is a good start. It may be more comfortable to go here than a spa for first timers. They have great monthly specials if you're on the mailing list. The atmosphere here is professional and soothing. I've been to other student spas that are crappy and run down so this is refreshing. The products they use are not full of abrasive chemicals. I find that the students really want to help you with whatever skin issue you're having. The facials are customized for your specific problems or concerns. I have probably taken six of my friends here and a couple who have never had a facial. I love taking out of town guests here because it is affordable and we're not spending the entire day there. I highly recommend trying this place.

I live in the Southwest valley and I didn't want to go to the dealer, which is VW since Saturn doesn't exist. I found this place on yelp and decided it might be worth the 20 mile trip. I suspected the issue was the rear wheel bearing and when I arrived, a mechanic took a ride with me to assess the noise I described. He took my vehicle to the bay and after about 20 minutes, I was told that my vehicle did need a wheel bearing hub and was asked if I wanted to have the work done. I had the work done and was stunned at the price. The service is great and the prices are honest. I arrived at 11:07a Saturday and was out the door at 12:58pm. I will definitely be back to have my other vehicle serviced as well. Tom also gave me 10% off my total since I mentioned yelp. Awesome service and prices!!

I went there with my husband for the 2nd time on a Sunday for lunch. When we walked in, three booths had customers in them. We waited about 13 minutes before the "grumpy old man" came out and had the attitude as if we had bothered him. So he sat us and walked away. Finally, the one waitress came over and took our drink orders. While waiting to place our lunch orders, my husband noticed a cobweb coming from the window to the fake flowers on the table. There is a considerable gap between the booth and the window. It was pretty disgusting and appeared that it had never been cleaned along with the windows and seat backs of the booths, which are cloth. We most likely will not return due to the condition of the restaurant and lackluster service. I would rather drive an extra 20 mins to Phoenix or Tempe and be appreciated. I really did try to like this place and support a local business in my community.

Decided to give this place a chance and was quite delighted. I am vegan and that's an issue sometimes. I tried the vegetable chow mein(medium spicy) and I love it. I get extra broccoli and there is so much flavor in the veggies and noodles. My husband has tried the General Tso's chicken, The BBQ pork chow mein, the mu shu pork and the garlic chicken and he loved them all. The great thing is that this is a family run business and it shows in the food. I highly recommend at least trying this place. it's reasonably priced and there are great lunch specials during the week.

I ended up here on a Sunday because Teavana didn't open until 12pm. This place is way better than Teavana and reasonably priced. Holly was very helpful and gave great recommendations. I love that you can smell the small jars of tea yourself and don't have to wait for someone to do it for you. There are tons of tea accessories and gifts. Holly even gift wraps!!  I also like that she sends tea to the troops overseas and you can purchase a bag of tea and personalize your own message. I recommend going here if you are interested in drinking good quality tea and have any questions. I don't live close, but will make the trip to go here.I will definitely be back!!

I actually looked up a place to have breakfast since I was on this side of town. We went in and found a table outside. It was supposed to rain and I thought it was cool they had plastic see through curtains with heaters on the patio. The server, Jeremy was really helpful and quick. The food came out quickly and was great. My husband got the flapjacks and I got the Tryst breakfast with shoestring fries. Everything was fresh, hot and delicious. I can't wait to try this place for lunch.

I tried this place out for lunch with a co-worker and was pleasantly surprised. The place was crowded so we sat at the bar. I ordered the house salad with creamy cilantro dressing and the sofrito beans. My friend orders a couple of tacos. My friend actually received her plate 10 minutes before I did, which didn't make sense, but whatever. The salad was really good. The beans were a little salty, as though the sauce had been reduced too much. I added the beans to my salad and it was heavenly. The atmosphere is a little loud but tolerable. I definitely recommend!

I walked in and was immediately greeted. This place is clean, welcoming, and relaxing. I got the coco pedicure which included a scrub and hot stone massage. I definitely recommend trying it out.

I initially tried Fired Pie on Veteran's day. My husband and I are Marine veterans, and Fired Pie was giving out a free pizza or salad for veterans. We arrived around 5:30 and it was really busy. The cashier told me that they had been opened for three days, so they were working out the kinks. We ordered our ow pizzas and got them for free, score! The ordering process is similar to Chipotles ( you tell the person what items you want on the item you are getting). The pizza was delicious, and was great the next day for lunch. We have been back since then and it is consistently scrumptious. The crust is crunchy and thin and the variety of sauces is great.I recommend trying  Fired Pie when visiting the area. It's $7.95 for a good quality pizza, which is a great deal.
