This place was okay. It was close to my house and I had limited time for a pedi so I decided to stop in, especially when they advertised $18 for a spa pedicure. Hence the 2 stars. I walked in and they were a tad busy but I stood at the counter for 5 minutes before I was even greeted. Poor customer service. I've NEVER walked into a nail salon without immediately being greeted as generally they know that's how they get and keep customers. Finally, after waiting 5 mins, a guy said "hi" "can I help you?" And I said "well hi, I've only been standing here 5 minutes" he said he didn't see me. Although his chair directly faced the front door but he was too busy chatting away to look up. The wait at 5pm was 20 mins. No big deal. However, they should have said, wait 20 minutes to get in the pedi chair then another 20 to be worked on. My feet were soggy by the time she started, not to mention the water was SCALDING hot when I sat down, she had to adjust it. We didn't talk much because I was reading a book but I was told the price would be $18 on the phone. After she did a hot stone & towel massage (which she didn't ask me if I wanted), and put coral polish on my toenails (to which she messed up a few toenails and got it on the cuticle without fixing), I walked to the front to be told my charge was $20. I'm not going to fuss about paying an extra $2 because the hot stones & towel feel great. HOWEVER, if you want to be know as a reputable business without shady antics, ASK FOR or OFFER services BEFORE you do them. Not after the fact. Let's just say I will not be returning!

Absolutely love this place! The owners and their family are extremely friendly, shop is clean, organized, and the food and drinks are amazing! Everything is healthy and freshly made or made to order. I've referred many people here and will continue to go here! They just expanded their lunch menu and I can't wait to try it!
