The Baseline Pub is awesome.  I have been coming here for some time and I am always satisfied.  Now this place is a total dive bar, yet it has all of the intangibles:  a hot bartender, good music, thick drinks and a cast of regulars that belong on a TV show.    The pub is ringed by hi-def flat screens.  They have a wide variety of sports on all day and they will be carrying the NFL package this season.  There are 3 pool tables that you can usually get on without much of a wait. Electronic darts, Golden Tee Live and Big Game Hunter also available.   Happy hour is pretty much all day long, you can get a tall Goose and tonic for $5.50 and the beer is pretty cheap too.  They have several running specials on Jerimiah Sweet Tea etc., but I just stick with Vodka.  Even at night the prices are more than reasonable.  Stop by for a few and get to know the Pub.

Got a great shave here.  However, the barber got a bunch of shaving cream on the back of my shirt and did not tell me.  I was alerted by a stranger who thought I was pooped on by a bird.  Should have addressed this when it happened instead of attempting to hide the mistake from me.  Not very professional.

Spoke with the owner and he offered to make it right.  The shirt washed clean so its all good.  As I said before, great place to get a shave.
