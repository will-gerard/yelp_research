First of all, Johnny Chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef. He is barely a line cook. As stated in previous reviews, he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits).  So, I made reservations, thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early. Wrong. I was ordered to wait outside. Nearly 45 minutes later, and a drink at the bar next door, I inquired about my table. The girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything. After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me, she finally said my table was ready. Hmm.  The food is horrible. I fear those of you who enjoy it, rather enjoy the "atmosphere" and come here to be seen. The food is either completely bland (e.g., my curry, which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor. By calling themselves "authentic Asian" cuisine is just silly. There are so many hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfolded.  So, the rude, nonexistent service, the insanely overpriced food, and to be seen is what you're paying for. If you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that I wouldn't feed in a troth for pigs--you may enjoy this place and good for you!

They do not use fresh ingredients, or at least they cook so badly to make it seem that way.  People must have to convince themselves that this place is good because it's the trendy thing to do. But you're better off going elsewhere if you want good Chinese food.  Here's a general tip for you guys: if the place isn't predominantly Asian, leave. That's a definite sign that the quality is sub-par. But if you're white and have never had genuine southern Chinese food, you'll probably just barely choke down your "food" and agree with most people that this place is decent.

The Dem party in Arizona is truly wonderful. They push issues that need to be pushed and stand behind their arguments, which by the way, always make sense.  These people are doing a fine job running our state and should be lauded as genuine people, willing to do the right thing.

Put on your most stylish threads and show up with a date, although not a first date.. the music is always blaring, and that would be awkward. Almost as awkward as people who still think going to the movies on a first date is a good idea. Nothing says "I don't like you" more than sitting in forced silence for two hours. But I digress. Merc Bar.. That place is quite dark and sleek inside -- very much a lounge. The drinks are all mostly $10+, but all of the bartenders I've been served by have been more than competent in their mixology skills.  This is a little piece of New York or Chicago nestled in between an ice cream shop and some other place.. I always forget what that other place is. But a visit to the Merc should be done at least once or twice.

This place has been my weakness since childhood. I still get food from here once a month or so. Probably the only fast food place I visit often, other than Five Guys when I lived on the east coast. If you're preparing for a trip to Mexico, just dine here once a week for a month or two before your vacation. You'll probably be introduced to much of the bacteria of delicious real-Mexican street food.  Perhaps it's not that bad, but it is delicious. Especially their "pastrami dog". You can be a self-proclaimed "foodie" all you want, with your "oh, ha! ha!, but I admit that I do on the occasion dine at the selected In-N-Out" pompous asshole who thinks you're still down-to-earth, or you can come down and gorge on some real disgusting, real fast food. What are you afraid of? Your arteries will expand enough to still allow the blood  through, don't worry. Sure, they may drop your hot dog on the ground and forget to use sanitary gloves from time to time, but how else are you going to break in your immune system, you sissy?

This is one of those "dive bars" that are not dive bars at all. Dive bars have local character to them--they're local bars. This place has become just dirty and embarrassing.  I came here regularly 10 years ago as I lived within walking distance. Just recently I went back a few times. If you enjoy drinking with "ironic" hipsters who likely all drive in from Scottsdale to this "hip place", then go ahead. Expect bugs and sewer stench, because whoever owns the place now just doesn't care anymore. The old regulars have long gone and the cool ironic kids have taken over, ironically drinking shitty beer, and ironically becoming drunken assholes.  Two stars for cheap drinks and good music, though. If you can stand the clientele, go for it, I guess. You're better off trying "that one little bar" near your house that you've never managed to go to, the place where there's charm and locals.  Actually, a "No Hipster" policy would make this bar pretty interesting. Full of old alcoholics, hookers, and bums.

I'm writing this review mainly to say that this location is now CLOSED.  Which is quite sad, not to mention perplexing, why TJ's would close one of their best-stocked and busy TJ's in the valley. Not a good move, in my opinion to force West Phoenix customers to drive either out to Arrowhead, 20th st/Camelback, or various other locations in Tempe and Scottsdale.  Bad business decision, in my opinion.

I've had the same problem with this restaurant that others here have had. The service is essentially non-existent and the food comes out cold/lukewarm and of low quality. However spicy you make your food, it's still somehow obvious that it's just not good.  I recommend driving down the street to Tandoori Times instead. The food, service, and experience is infinitely better.

Forget it.  As a child, my parents and I would make the drive out here once a month to eat. I loved it. I remember it being almost 'grandma's house' friendly. I don't remember much about the food, but I've been back a few times more recently (before the change in ownership) and loved it.  But then some very shady things happened and the business was essentially stolen from the long-time owners. I shamefully say that I've since been twice. It's not the same by any means. There's no soul in the (albeit basic, no fancy stuff here) food preparation. It's a cold atmosphere, as well. And the atmosphere used to BE the place. There are a few other decent places around. Avoid the new Satisfied Frog.  It's sad. Well, according to the website, the previous and rightful owners have a new place up in Black Canyon City. I'm hoping to be up that way some time soon, with any hope the old atmosphere has been transferred.

I've been here at least a dozen times over the years (wow, the first time was nearly 10 years ago) and have always put off reviewing it, anywhere. But here's the skinny:  * You will have to wait. Expect to wait. Expect the wait-time to be longer than you were told. Be patient. Hey, there's been a bar next door for a little while now. Go have a few drinks. Food tastes better anyway with the aid of the Booze Goddess coursing through your veins. Trust me, they'll find you.  * Do not be put off by the perceived rudeness of the staff. They're overworked and get lots of impatient, pushy idiots everyday (not you, of course. Other idiots). Also, it's more "authentic" that way. If you don't like it, don't go to Italy. Basta.  * The food's good. Only twice out of the dozen+ pizzas I've tried here was one burnt to the point of "inedibility". Bianco knows what he's doing. Let him do what he does. He uses the freshest ingredients and that's why you've waited hours to eat his food (i.e., it's worth it).  So, yeah. Get over it and eat. I've seen very little deterioration in the quality of the product over the years. And with the recent surge in diners over the last year or so since the Oprah bandwagon of minivans came over, that says a lot. This isn't one of those places where "the hype" needs to be taken into account.

So, I walked in to Padre's, looked around, and decided to take a seat at the bar. I asked the bartender for a menu and he told me that he couldn't serve me. Having never been to Padre's before, I inquired as to what on earth he was talking about. Apparently the rent-a-security gave some sort of secret service hand signal not to serve me. But why?  Then the gorilla at the door decided to pay me a personal visit, came over, and asked me to leave himself. I mean, I was dressed in an expensive jacket, slacks, a nice collared shirt, and I'm a clean-cut late 30-something guy. So, it wasn't as if I had stumbled in wearing a sequin-studded thong and nipple tassels with my junk hanging out. I asked to speak to the manager. The door guy left and returned a few seconds later. He simply said something to the bartender, then there was my menu. Apparently somebody earlier wearing the "same color jacket" was kicked out, for some reason.  No apology, nothing. I ordered a beer and left. With a simple apology from someone.. anyone.. I would have stayed for dinner.  My advice, if you go: do not wear a burgundy jacket.

The only thing I can say about this place is that "it's better than Taco Bell". Actually "It's Better Than Taco Bell" should be its slogan.  The first thing that should alert you is when the owner (25-year-old son of a Las Vegas casino mogul) says that "there's no good Mexican food in Phoenix".  I guess charging $10 for some Fritos dip and $25 more for some "better than Taco Bell" food is the way to go. . . if you're a millionaire and don't care about your product.  I went here once to try it out, and two more times I was dragged with friends. It got worse each time. Really, it's not worth it. There are other places to eat horrible food and be tragically hip in.  But, hey. If you're holding your crisp 50-dollar-bill and can't decide between 40 tacos from Taco Bell or an incredibly lackluster meal surrounded by hipsters in an overrated restaurant... give it a shot.

This place is empty these days for a reason.  It took almost an hour to get my supposedly medium-rare Kobe beef burger. I also ordered it with red onions, pickles, chipotle mayo, and on a whole wheat bun. The chef of the evening decided upon himself to correct my order while in the kitchen. I received a very well-done piece of mystery meat (it could have been dog meat at this point, the depressing char masking its true identity) with arugala and bacon on a white bun.  I sent the order back, because for $15, I should be able to make my own culinary decisions. Shouldn't I?  This time, twenty minutes later, I received again a burnt piece of tasteless meat (maybe they ran out of salt and pepper and couldn't figure out where to buy some?), but with the original toppings that I ordered. Well, aside from the bun -- that remained white.  The meat also looked very familiar, and at this point I wouldn't put it past them to have just placed the patty under a heat lamp, went out for a few cigarettes, then returned the burger to me. But I'm also just a cynical bastard. I ate half of the burger before feeling like vomiting a little in my mouth, downed my water, paid (after hunting down my waitress), and left.  If you want to pay this much for a burger, go to Delux instead. The quality at Blu Burger Grille appears to be extreme hit/miss.

I've been here a few times with friends and it's always been the same. The service is great, the atmosphere is fine, the food is adequate, and the dessert is definitely a step or two above average...  ...but it's a bad copy of Houston's. And they tend to be very snippy about any sort of comparison with them.  Although, again, if I could rate them differently for their dessert, they would have received possibly 4 stars. It might be a place where a few cocktails over dessert could be quite appealing. But I can't shake the fact that, while the two menus share many similarities, the menu at Houston's is more streamlined and just provides.. more.  It's sadly a forgettable dining experience.

While it's difficult for me to give a place that serves Dead Guy Ale and cider on tap one star, the "pint" glass issue bothers me, as an honest and seasoned drinker. American pints are supposed to hold 16 ounces of delicious liquid happiness, but Tilted Kilt's thick-walled, thick-bottomed glasses only seem to hold 12 ounces (I also tested this with a 12-ounce bottle). I just don't see this place as having to cut corners like that, given its popularity.  Not to mention the fact that it's a bit shameful for an Irish/English themed bar to not serve Imperial pints, in my opinion.  Aside from that fact, it seems to be a decent place to watch games, ogle scantily clad waitresses, be cheated out of 4 ounces, or do other quite manly stuff that manly men do in sports bars. The food is also largely forgettable, but adequate for sports bar food.

If I put an In-N-Out burger in a McDonald's wrapper, you'd hate it. I'd hate it. Everybody would hate it.  This place is one of those things that gives you some sort of perverted "foodie cred" if you claim you like it. Sure, I'd choose it over the big fast-food chains, but that's like saying I'd rather be kicked in my left testicle than in my right testicle.  In the end, I'm still being kicked in my nuts.  But if you're the type of person who thinks "ironic t-shirts" are actually witty, then you'll probably love In-N-Out.

I honestly do not know why this hotel has such a difficult time finding a decent restaurant. The hotel is really a great boutique hotel. But definitely go off-premises for food. There's no need to regurgitate the other bad reviews, but if you chose to go and actually have a nice time (in my experience that would be a 1 in 4 chance), then good for you. But in an area where within a few mile radius you can eat infinitely better and for cheaper, you might just be a nickenpoop. And the restrooms have consistently been sub-par. Just think, if a restaurant can't keep a bathroom clean (which is very simple to do), what must their kitchen look like?  But if you're in this for the weird status symbol stuff, then go here and be seen. It's one of the "required" spots for that sort of thing -- at least once.

First of all, the atmosphere and decor of this place is quite nice. But I would never come here for the food again, which is overpriced and fails to deliver. On the other hand, with the right people, and some nice clothes, it would be nice to sit for a bit and pay for $15 cocktails, I suppose.  My suggestion would be to eat across the way at Cowboy Ciao and maybe stop over for a cocktail or two. Service was 'okay' the two times I was there, however.  Note: if you do not frequent restaurants that cannot maintain proper bathroom hygiene, do NOT patronize this restaurant. If you can't keep your restrooms tidy (one of the easiest things to do in a restaurant), imagine what their kitchen must be like!

I really wanted to love this place, since it is run by one of the guys from Efes.  But I couldn't even finish my meal.  First of all, the meat is pre-cooked and microwaved to order. So if you enjoy chewing on tasteless meat for 10 minutes per bite, then you may enjoy this. The price is not cheap enough to forgo proper (and simple) cooking techniques.  The hummus was, however, tasty. Although very familiar. I believe they may have bought it from Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli on 16th street.  The salad that came with my meal was uninspired and I also found what I believe to be a fingernail fragment in it. I don't know. But it was unexpected as it crunched in my mouth.  This place has some potential, but they really need to provide better ingredients and especially better preparation. As is, it's embarrassing to be called Turkish/Middle Eastern food. It's really the McDonald's of the genre.  Also, please. The Mexican hot sauce does not belong in your restaurant, and especially not slathered on your pita bread.

The "sushi chefs" are cackling, blond inexperienced chefs. Despite that, the sushi is decent. The sashimi is pathetic. And the nigiri is pitiful. The drinks are also decent. The decor is what you would expect for a higher-class Scottsdale establishment. But this is yet another place where you need to have a drink or two, be seen, then go elsewhere for the food.  One star for the adequate pour on the drinks we ordered.

They added too much to their menu, and they're overwhelmed. They also got rid of their good lunch specials. So, go here for the drinks and the atmosphere.  Hopefully the management is only doing this temporarily. Because I miss their $5 lunch specials. They're not so popular yet as to scrape those, add a dozen items to the menu, and call it quits. Their kitchen can't handle it.  So, eat beforehand and come up. The drinks are still good, until they raise the prices of those too.  Edit: Spoke too soon. I just went to their website and noticed they changed their "$3 Smithwicks Every day All Day" to the far inferior Carlsberg for $3 whatever, whatever. Oh, it's sad to see such potential beginning to tank so soon. Service has dropped, quality of food has dropped, and now they really are already raising their drink prices. Shame.

Lee Lee's finally expanded from their Chandler location for us who have loyally driven an hour to shop. Low prices, huge selection, and it only took like a week for the place to smell like a true Asian market (i.e., wherever you are, you will never escape the smell of fish).  I love it. I bought ingredients for Vietnamese spring rolls, two different kinds of curries, a new motor/pestle, a Vietnamese coffee press, and some various other vegetables and liquors... hardly anything. Also, the seafood, while I didn't purchase any, looks very fresh.  Wonderful to see such a great addition to west Phoenix.

I stopped by here recently around 9am and the donuts I got tasted like they were made a week ago. Stale and old. I thought they were supposed to make them fresh regularly? I love Krispy Kreme donuts, but this location seems to be run by a Dunkin' Donuts undercover spy hellbent on tainting the good name of Krispy Kreme.  This saddens me greatly.

It's good to know that it wasn't an alcohol-induced delirium and that this aforementioned waitress really existed.  The food is a 2 or 3, as with most Denny's, but it's a 4 if she's waiting your table.
