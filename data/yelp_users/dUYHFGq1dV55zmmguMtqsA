The mall is a good mall, has great stores, and plenty variety. However the food court is slacking. Apparently the restaurants are owned by one company. It's a franchise. I remember coming here back on the day where they had plenty variety of good food to choose from. But over the years the good restaurants slowly started to close and were replaced with these crappy ones. The quality is not worth the price you pay in food. If you had better food options the mall would probably bring in more revenue. The choices here suck.

When is Walmart going to realize all their customers want are more than 2 lines open I mean come on you have about 20 of em! I mean with all these employees standing around I'm sure you could use them to open another four registers. Standing in the self check out line or any other line for 30min is absurd. Including the 20items or less line. Walmart is a great franchise think about how much greater it could be when it focuses on customers wants and needs. We want and need more check out cashiers!!!

The chairs are SO nice. I love that they are black with wooden accents. The fact that they can go all the way back instead of riverviews that don't go all the way back so you're at an awkward angle. Nervous that I just might fall asleep because of the comfortability

The food was amazing but, a super inconvenience that they can't split checks. You're in the customer service industry and dividing payments is a huge part of that. The fact that it's such a hassle makes me second guess coming here. You need to upgrade your payment method to accommodate you're customers. Other than that service was good!

The bartender with black hair stares us down any time we come in. Makes us feel extremely unwelcome. Our first time here myself and one of my friends had just turned 21 and hadn't had our new ID's so they didn't allow us to drink which was fine. But as our other friends ordered drinks she continuously told them that we better not be taking sips and being sneaky. Basically treating us like children. My boyfriend is a fan of the draft choices. The biggest improvement needed is the location of the pool tables. It's hard to hit or shoot the balls at a good angle without hitting the wall or bumping into the wall separating them from the seating area. It would be a smarter choice to have the pool tables in the middle and move the tables to where the pool tables are now. Heard this place was on bar rescue but looks like it did the opposite of that. We miss the bronco decor!!

Amazing mall! All the good stores and an amazing food court. Plenty to choose from at reasonable prices. Ul this is my go to mall.  Because it's such a good mall it's usually ALWAYS packed. But not only is it easy to access there's plenty of restaurants around the mall as well. And the freeway is accessible

This big fish was caught today by a fellow fisher using night crawlers and a 8'inch hook. Massive fish took 30min to real it in

Beautiful homes and surrounding grass/out side. However the parking lot is ridiculously poorly designed. You have to walk half a football field just to get to your apt/car unless you pay 30$ a month for a designated parking spot under a cover. They do have some parking spots up front but the apartments are so filled the chances of you getting one are very rare. Grocery shopping is such a hassle due to the lack of close parking available. You are allowed to park in a restricted parking zone for 20min to help the commute from the car to the apartment a little quicker(closer) But 20 min isn't a lot for people who live on the 3rd floor and only have two hands! Im afraid my car will get towed! I would never choose to live here after experiencing the hassles of the parking lot and the commute to and from the apartment. In my opinion I feel like the parking spaces should all be free to whomever for the price that rent is. And they should charge for garage parking only.    I don't think they really care about the people paying to live there rather looking for any excuse to charge.

So far my experience here has been good! The girl doing my nails didn't bring the nail polish all the way up to my cuticle so that was a little upsetting. The girl who did my eye brows did a fast and accurate job, even with those pesti little hairs that are stubborn! For the price you pay the quality is amazing. It's such a cute little store, and their English is better compared to other nail spas. Which is important since communication between each other is better understood and there's no confusion. Had a good nail color selection I wish they organized it by color that would be a lot more useful when trying to find the perfect shade. The back wall is covered in different types of wood it's very beautiful. The staff are friendly and very personable. This is the first salon I've gotten my nails done that haven't made fun of me or made remarks towards my short nails. I will definitely be returning  as this is my now go to salon!

Absolutely amazing! They moved our 1 bedroom on the 4th floor in Tempe to our new 1 bedroom on the 2nd floor In Mesa within 2 hours! Did I mention there was no elevator?? Keeping us in budget ! They were fast and efficient. They asked where we wanted which boxes, and were sure to put them in the correct rooms. They got to our house 10 minutes before their scheduled time, and started right at 8:00 AM as planned. They finished just before 10:00 AM . It was a huge weight off our shoulders having them there to help us and finishing on time. I was worried as I've heard a ton of people talking about how they had hired movers who slacked off and took a long time to get paid more in the end; this was not the case today I couldn't be more happy with the service they provided. I would recommend to friends and family. And as a first time customer and first time mover I'm very pleased. My boyfriend and I didn't feel taken advantage of at all.

My boyfriend and I come here every weekend absolutely love the half priced wings and fries. I love fries but I'm very picky about them and I have to say these fries are my top favorite. I hope they don't Change a thing to the mine or prices. We rave about it to all of our friends. We went to the boulders on Broadway and it didn't compare at all. Boulders on southern is where it's at. The could use less tables and more pool tables though. They have a shelf with board games which is a blast when you're drinking, eating dinner, an having a good time. Their wings used be a lot bigger but they seem to be getting smaller in size each time we go. Regardless I love this place and recommend it to everyone
