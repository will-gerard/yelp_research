I went to Physiotherapy Associates in 2010 for a sprained ankle. From the first day I came in, I was in the hands of students and not licensed physical therapists. The licensed PTs barely checked on me during each appointment.  Then, 9 months later they "changed their billing system" and I continue to receive bills for the visits that my insurance and I paid for. When I call to ask about it, I'm told "Well, it looks like we forgot to bill your insurance for some of the services rendered that day, so you're going to need to take care of the balance."   Don't go here unless you like paying premium price (and then some) to have PT students work on you.

Dr Bode is wonderful, HOWEVER... On my first visit, I waited over 2 hours past my scheduled appointment to get in. I thought that a morning appointment would work out better, but I'm currently 90 minutes past my appointment time and STILL waiting for Dr Johnson. This place really needs to figure out how to respect other people's time.

Many of my reviews are long and wordy, giving the owners and management the opportunity to get honest feedback. Guru Palace makes this easy - there is no "The Not-so-Good" section for them, only the reasons they get full marks and one very prestigious honor:  This is the BEST curry I have ever had - which includes a Tour d' Curry I went on in England, trying to find the best curry.  The Good:  - Food: Again...I say only that THIS IS THE BEST CURRY I HAVE EVER HAD. The garlic naan also incredible - flaky and light. The most interesting thing that I have started to notice with Indian restaurants is the anise and licorice mixes on the way out. Guru Palace has fresh, soft anise that puts a refreshing finish to your experience.   - Ambiance: Guru Palace has the most beautifully appointed ambiance of any Indian restaurant I have visited. There is a place to sit at a low table on pillows with a group if you'd like to take the ambiance one step further. The lighting is romantic, but not so low as to make you miss the nuances of your company.   - Service: After the second time my fiancee and I went to Guru palace, they recognized us and welcomed us back. When you order to go, they are on time and responsive to you.  - Prices: The most incredible thing about Guru Palace is that all of the things I mention above come at very reasonable prices. There are no surprises on your bill, and if you happen to come by for the lunch buffet, it's nothing short of a killer deal.

Update: I just received a call from the general manager and partner, Scott. Wow! This is someone who takes their reputation seriously. My fiancee and I will be going back to 5th and Wine very soon and will give an update. For customer service and pride in reputation alone, I will be bumping this to a 4 star review. I'm pulling for them to earn that 5th star on our second visit!  ******Original Review - 3 Stars******  Before you read on, please note that 5th and Wine made a couple critical errors that I'll highlight, but overall they have a lot going for them.  The good: Excellent wine selection that has a thoughtful complexity that compliments their menu. The food is cooked beautifully and seasoned delicately so as not to overpower the full body of the wines they serve. The truffle fries were fantastic and I'd recommend them to anyone looking for something to munch on here.  The Bad: First, we'll start with the service. It was over 10 minutes and we had both chosen wines and entrees by the time we saw our sever. This was 5 minutes after we had seen the sever gesture, asking if we were her table from the hostess. The demeanor of the sever resembled someone being forcibly kept against their will. Not a great start to date night.    I had the steak and frites, my fiancee had the shrimp scampi. The shrimp were a but overcooked, but overall an excellent dish. The steak, on the other hand, was clearly the end cut of a poorly butchered loin. The top had more elevation changes than Four Peaks and there were three distinct silver skins cutting the steak into impenetrable sections. The steak knife I had was incapable of dealing with the toughness of the meat, the last inch was cooked into shoe leather, and the sever said nothing when she took 4 ounces of connective tissue and overcooked meat away on my plate.

Definitely the worst gel manicure I've had. The technician didn't even bother to scrape all of the old gel off, didn't soak my cuticles or push them back, and when i pointed out several times that there was something wrong with one of them, she ignored me. I've never broken a nail within 2 weeks of a gel manicure, and I've broken 3 within a week of this botched job, and most of the other nails have gel pulling up at the edges.  Won't be wasting my money here anymore.

Incredibly moist cupcakes that actually compliment their frosting instead of being buried by it. I got my sweetie a gluten free cupcakes which was fantastic, and he finally got his cake fix after discovering his wheat/gluten allergy.

My original review is noted below, but I had to circle back and give an update. Bar en Gril has become a regular haunt for my husband and I, and they have really listened and become an all-around excellent experience. The food is as consistent (and consistently great) as it gets, they now have San Tan on tap, and their staff is pleasant, friendly and professional every time.  BRAVO!  "Just visited Bar en Gril last night, and I have to say, my husband and I were very pleased with that decision.   We tried the artichoke dip, which was fresh and flavorful with delicious and fresh pita chips. I tried the Philly cheese steak and my husband an Italian combo sandwich (can't remember which one, and Bar en Gril does not yet have an online menu i can find), but they were both fantastic. The au jus I had as a side was fresh and not salty powder from a packet for once. The shoestring french fries my husband had were delicious and  I felt like we were getting the quality of food we were paying for.  The music was great and my husband and i found ourselves saying "Oh I love this song" at least 5 times during the meal. The bar poured a great beer that was cooled perfectly and not too much head on it. Only two things to the folks at Bar en Gril on the beer selection:  #1 Here in the East Valley, it's all about San Tan brews, so a Devil's Ale tap would be awesome. :-)  #2 Running out of the local brew that you do have (Kilt Lifter) is not the best. It's understandable when you're just trying to hit par on your orders and feel out the crowd preference. I promise that those kegs will never go bad though- so order away!  The servers were fun and energetic. I would give Bar en Gril 5 stars (for the concept type), but there's just a couple of things that need work:  1. Servers need to watch the chit chat about side work on the restaurant floor and not "hang out" in the doorway to the kitchen when there are people eating at the table right next to the kitchen entrance. I think this will definitely resolve itself once this place gets busier and more people discover this little gem.  2. The atmosphere could use some work. The walls feel a bit bare, and the floor itself feels a bit stark. Maybe some locak Gilbert sports memerobilia or some sort of theme other than dark walls and a TV every few feet.   Overall, a GREAT first experience. I can tell from the first service, to the first and all the way through the last bite that this restaurant has great folks in the kitchen, great folks out front, and is determined to be a favorite local spot. And for my husband and I, we will DEFINITELY be making it a regular hangout and be introducing our friends to it."

The Henry is another home run for Fox Restaurant concepts. The extensive drink menu has an amazing selection of brown liquors and interesting concoctions. There is attention to detail in everything from decor to seasoning in the food  which makes this an amazing place to dine and drink.  Coffee this morning was flavorful and robust. The espresso beans didn't have an overpowering roast, but it will definitely wake you up in the morning.  I HIGHLY recommend the CB and Rye for lunch, as it is some of the most perfectly balanced, not too salty corned beef I've found. It keeps a meaty texture while still being incredibly juicy and tender. Excellent!  Bar menu can't be overstated. The cocktails were interesting and worth the price, and as a beer connoisseur, I appreciated that the only thing "common" on tap was Stella (4 Taps with rotating seasonal). The bottled beer selection showed sophistication and makes this a great place for a business happy hour.  The Henry would absolutely be 5 stars if it weren't for one big ambiance hindrance at a busy lunch -- it is INCREDIBLY loud in the restaurant. I heard about every 3rd word my server was saying and ended up a bit hoarse from talking so loudly to the people in my booth. If you're heading to the Henry at lunch time for a meeting, be sure arrange in advance and to ask for one of the more secluded meeting tables.
