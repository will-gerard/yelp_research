I went for my brothers bachelor party and one of the dancers pick pocketed my brother ! We told the security guards which dancer did it and they threw us out of the club. We had been buying dances, drinks & having a party,  so watch your pockets and don't get too drunk.  Management there doesn't care!  Visit another club, this one isn't it!!! Not a full bar, you pay $20 admission and $1 for a "cup" ...all you can drink. No food available That should say it all right there.....

Was visiting Pittsburgh & stopped in here for a drink and sushi after Gay Pride Concert, and I was beyond impressed! Not only with the fresh sushi and kick ass cocktails but the staff was stellar! Very attentive and even got my sushi order in after the sushi bar was just about to shut down for the evening. OMG, the manager; Shiah Richardson (she impressed me so much that I made it a point to grab her card so I would remember her name specifically for this review) was beyond accommodating!  She greeted us at the door, made a few suggestions from the menu & when asked about sushi (as I noticed the sushi chef preparing to break the bar down) She assured us that it wasn't too late to get a sushi order in. I haven't seen a manager and a staff work as a "team" in years! Talk about TEAMWORK! Any manager that is that zealous and dedicated to their job definitely deserves a raise! Next time I visit Pittsburgh this will definitely be on my places to dine AGAIN AND AGAIN! My only regret is that we arrived earlier in the day so we could EAT MORE SUSHI and try more of their signature drinks. Thanks Original Fish Market!

Had a taste for pizza, and after just coming home from NYC I have been on the quest to find authentic NYC pizza.  A few people told me thier pizza was good, and after falling in love Spinato's pizza, and finding out they were closed on Monday's I decided to give Streets of New York pizza a try. I should have waited until Tuesday when Spinato's was open. Streets of NY Pizza was mediocre. Nothing like NY Pizza but better than Pizza Hut (I stay away from major chains). I was disappointed. Ordered my pizza to go, the server at the bar was only 18 and talking about all her "personal" boyfriend business with another customer. Felt like it was very unprofessional, but then again--she was only 18.  It was $2 per topping. My pizza was over $20. I think it was overpriced for the quality. I probably would have been better off waiting until Tuesday to visit Spinato's (which TRULY is good pizza) or went to the Groceries and bought a Digiorno pizza.

OMG! This Cajun Kitchen ROCKED! I have spent plenty of time in New Orleans, LA and the thing I miss most is the food! This Cajun food is simply the best in AZ! Everything was authentic and oh sooo good! Not to mention, live music the Saturday night we were there. The service was top notch! Efficient, laid back, and she never missed a beat! Typical of NOLA service! The Etouffee & the bread pudding was the best! You could taste the bourbon sauce in the bread pudding, which melts in your mouth! It did have coconut in it which was a bit different for me. ALL in ALL I wish this place had a brunch. I definitely will be back

WOW! This IS the best pizza in Phoenix. I personally am not a fan of thin crust BUT this place changed My mind. We were going to get the thick crust until we noticed EVERY table had ordered the thin crust. The sauce is AMAZING! We even bought some to take home. The service was quite attentive as well. The night we came they had beer specials. Hooray for specials! I travel nationwide ALOT and have been on the quest for the best pizza in Phoenix for about 2 years now. THIS IS IT! I just wish they delivered to My house. They did mention that several people order delivery outside the coverage area and meet them at a gas station (QT and circle K) to pick up pizza.  Talk about going above and beyond for customer service. WE WILL BE BACK and bringing more friends next time. Like that it was LGBTQ friendly. Thanks Spinato's!

Pro's: Made to order sushi "all u can eat" bar. Fresh made to order Mongolian stir fry  Con's: mediocre buffet items. fresh oysters looked old, the same # of oysters sat on the bar the entire 4 hours we were there. CAN U SAY FOOD POISON!!! DON'T ORDER BROWN RICE on your sushi, it tasted 3 days old! server was rude and unattentive  overpriced buffet  Meh, I have had way better! Perhaps next time I will come JUST FOR THE ALL U CAN EAT SUSHI

OMG, I wasn't expecting such an amazing dining experience!  The service and waitress was superb! The Sushi was the freshest I have had in Pittsburgh & the General Tso's (which I order from almost every Chinese restaurant) was the best I have ever had.  Even had the option to get brown rice for no additional cost, this Dumpling House was the best!!!

I love this pizza! American classic pizza!!! Every time I visit  Pittsburgh this stop becomes a staple! The sauce is amazing! Everything is made fresh, in house. They even grate the cheese them self!

Being new to the Phoenix area, I decided to visit the Swinger Lifestyle club. Guess I am a bit spoiled after living in Atlanta for 11 years and being a  member of Trapeze (upscale swingers club). Encounters left Me blah. The decor and furniture needs to be updated (everything seems at least 15/20 years old) UPGRADE. It is a very HETEROSEXUAL club! I went here with a crew of Female Friends, & when we got a little friendly with each other, they told us a "man' had to be present in the room. WTH! The selection of people in attendance are not all that cute (call Me shallow, I LOVE EYE CANDY) All in all, I might visit again on a "Ladies get in FREE" night.

Weekend brunch @ Ticoz was one of the best brunch dining experiences I have had in a while! Service was stellar, atmosphere was heavenly, & brunch (I had the Eggs Benedict) the best I have ever tasted! BTW, I travel 80 % of the year and eat out across the country... Ticoz Resto - Bar, I will be doing again before I leave Phoenix.

This sports bar reminded me of "Cheers" everyone knows everyone! From customers, to bartender, cooks and servers. Went last night with a good friend who comes here all the time. It was karoke and I do not do karoke but this place was jammin! Everyone was into it! Friendly service! THE NACHOS were the best I have had in Phoenix (debating going again tonight JUST TO ORDER THE NACHOS) The wings were yummy too! Both were suggested by our server. This bar isn't in My neighborhood, but I will make the drive again and again. See U soon!!!!

After agreeing to meet a friend here, as this was Her favorite spot. I showed up on the wrong "party" night.  It was extremely loud and chaotic. I attempted to order a drink at the bar while I wait for Her, and with NO luck.  We decided to go next door to another space. Perhaps you might want to try the space on a slower afternoon?

Want really good Thai food? THIS IS THE PLACE! This is the best I have found in the Valley. Everything on the menu is amazing (yes, I think I have frequented here so much I have tried everything on the menu) The staff is amazing as well, always make me feel welcome and at home. Just be sure to get here at least 15 minutes before they close.

I have found my new spa! this I travel nationwide and have visited alot of shops. This one is the best experience ever. Prices were competitive and oh so worth it. The shop is upscale in appearance, all the nail techs speak very good english, inviting in their conversation & professional in their dress. (white spa shirts and name badges) The pedicure was complete with detox salt scrub for my entire legs, hot cotton scented towels and they spent just as much on my leg massage as they did when they massaged my back after my pedicure. ALL for $18. THEY WILL SEE ME EVERY WEEK. I will tell all my friends, this is by far the best nail spa in phoenix! Thanks Susan for my amazing pedicure and your delightful yet professional attitude.

A friend brought here for the wig & stocking collection OH YES! I had to control myself because there were soooo many cute wigs. Nice plus size panty hose selection too & pretty reasonably priced. Would have shopped more more more, but I didn't bring another suitcase & I was flying back home. I did so much shopping this visit to Pittsburgh, I wish my friend brought me to this store first day of my visit--not the last day... Now I know for next time!?!?

I joined a friend of Mine here for Her birthday dinner. Reservations had to be made so I assumed it was pretty upscale. Especially after reading the reviews. The Pro's: atmosphere is simple yet intimate and sophisticated.  Server was knowledgeable over the entire menu. Including the wine list. Food was heavenly! Felt like I was showcasing dishes from Iron Chef or some other food challenge show. Like a food orgasm of flavor and textures in My mouth!!! The Con's; small portions & extremely pricey!We easily spent $70 per person. Parking was confusing! No street parking, parking garage around the block. Teeter House will validate so make sure to take your ticket with you. Food prep time was a bit long (over 30 minutes). Overall GREAT upscale dining experience, Great for a nice date nite. Just make sure your date has some class & some cash....

Oh My! I love this place! Every time I visit Pittsburgh now this place is on my list! My menu favorites;  Papaya salad Chicken salad ANY and all the pho soup bowls! They are huge too! Enough for 2 people to split one bowl. Atmosphere is clean, classic and decorated nicely.

The atmosphere is extremely nice. However the service was terrible.  Had to hunt My server down and eventually asked for the manager. I enjoy the Old Spaghetti Factory nationwide, just not this ONE. The one in Phoenix is way better! With better service! Larger portions, and better "old italian" style atmosphere.

I met a social group here last night for our monthly meet up. This was My 1st time @ Pizza-Re & was initially thrilled at the small space. Great for conversation. HOWEVER the pizza was mediocre. I love pizza & this was average tasting in My opinion. Fell along the lines of any pizza chain, pizza hut or domino's caliber. I was under the impression this was going to be some good gourmet pizza. The prices were gourmet but the pizza was ehhhh, I can't believe I drove from Phoenix for this pizza. They did have a low card option which was nice, but the only thing that was yummy was the cheese. The pizza with crust seemed large in size and simply average in taste. They do not sell alcohol but you can bring your own beer and wine, however they will charge you to open it! Great environment for socializing, but I certainly was NOT impressed.

OMG! Why did it take a "happy accident" to bump into this place? After looking for another restaurant in the area & getting lost one late Monday night, this place looks cute and OPEN so we decided to stop in. Glad we did! Monday night $5martini, $5manicures & $5 brick oven pizza= SCORE! The music was cute and the atmosphere, especially "Bubbles" the pink elephant on the wall I knew We were in good hands. The esthetician on duty did an amazing job, on our manicures! The $5 martini list was pages long! So many good choices, I definitely need to put this on my "after work 5 pm Monday happy hour HOUR!" The $5 brick oven pizza selection was so yummy We ordered 2 pizzas to go/take home! Our server; Brandon was AMAZING! Anticipated all of our needs before We asked!  Even received a appetizer brushetta compliments of the chef that was paired with our Martini's ever so PERFECT! (Both the Washington Apple Martini & the Thyme Martini were stellar!) Definitely a $20 Martini! We will be back next Monday!
