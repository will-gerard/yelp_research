I USED TO LOVE THIS PLACE. But in the last year, the place has totally run down its product quality AND its customer service. My last three orders have all had mistakes and were late in delivery. When I called to have the situation remedied, all I got was a  $2 credit on a FUTURE ORDER. WTF?!?!?! You can't get it right the last three times and you think I am going to keep coming back? GET REAL!! Not only have you lost what was a regular customer, I will see to it my friends no longer patronize your establishment either.
