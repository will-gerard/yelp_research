Had a great meal with some friends. Everything was great at the restaurant. Love the breadsticks, by the way. You can never have too many on the table! Cut to 5 hours later waking up at 1 am to spend the next two hours vomiting violently. Sea food + vomit = ROWDY!!! Maybe it was my fault for ordering sea food in the desert??? Would normally give OG 4 stars but just can't do it this time.

This little farmers market is pretty solid. Fresh, local produce that beats the hell out of anything you can get at the grocery store. The tomatoes they sell actually taste like tomatoes! Their fruit is much better as well and the the kicker...wait for it....Freshly roasted Hatch green chilies! They also have a peach orchard out back. You can pick your own or buy them in the shop when they're in season. Just a great, all around local farmer's market. You need to check it out.

Pei Wei is the originator and everyone else is an imitator! They're on point. Every time, without fail. I always know what to expect. Fast service, great food and a fair price. My only complaint is the seating. The tables are a little close and it is hard to have a conversation without the table on either side of you being a part of it.   Order anything on the menu. It will be a home run!

I've driven past this place more times than I can count. For the most part, I'm not big on breakfast. I like it, but its an occasional thing. We decided to go out for breakfast this morning and I thought we should give this place a shot.  Good call! This place is great. Its a little small and there is a little bit of a wait but the food and service were on point!  The wife orders coffee, an egg white omelet with ham, bacon, jalapeno and cheese. It comes with potatoes and toast and looks amazing!  I go for a glass of OJ and their breakfast special: a green chile and pork omelet. They served it with potatoes and a fresh, warm tortillas. Think New Mexico mornings!!! AWESOME!!!  All in all a great place. We'll definitely go again.

The Melting Pot is a dining EXPERIENCE. If you get a private booth, it can be a very romantic dining experience.   Heres the deal...As mentioned in other reviews, the food is good but not amazing (except for dessert!). Set aside a good 2 1/2 - 3 hours for dinner, drinks and conversation. It takes a while. If you are one of those who likes to order, eat and get the hell out...this is not the place for you. Be ready to relax, have a few drinks and take your time. The cheese course, salad and main course are there as distractions. The spotlight is firmly held on the dessert course! Its freeking amazing!!! We haven't had a dessert at the melting pot that we didn't LOVE!

So, when a brewery stops making their own beer and has another brewery contract brew it for them....are they still a brewery? It doesnt matter here. They have an AMAZING selection of beer! More handles than you see just about anywhere else and they all rotate!!! There is something different here every time I go. If you dont like what they have on tap (I cant see how that could ever be possible), they have one of the largest bottle selections in the Valley. You can get the bottled selections and or a growler of any of the draft beers to go as well. Pretty cool. Try the Elsie's Irish Cream Milk Stout if they have it! Just effin beautiful!!!  As with most brew pubs, they focus on beer, not food. It's unfortunate because when I sit and drink great beer for a while, I want great food to go with it. Their food offerings are ok. Just nothing to get excited about.  Definitely hit this place up if you're in the area. If you're not, then wait til the weekend and make the drive. If you like great beer and sampling different kinds of beer in the same session, this is the place!

Four Peaks is the dominant brewery here in Phoenix. It has a long history, great location near ASU and a pretty good reputation here locally. You can find their beer in other restaurants around town and in the grocery stores as well.  Its a great place to go with a group of friends. The place is usually pretty busy and the eye candy is amazing! Thanks, ASU!  The music is great. You can tell the owner is a Dead Head. There is always a great mix of Jam Bands playing. Really ties into the college vibe. Nice touch!  The menu is good for the most part but pretty static. They dont change it up much. They do however have a daily special that is typically not on the standard menu. These offerings are usually pretty darn good and I would suggest giving them a try.  Four Peaks makes good beer. The problem is that they dont make amazing beer. Most of their beers are very middle of the road. They dont really push any envelopes in terms of style or big flavor. They do make a few seasonals that are pretty interesting. Their Pumpkin Porter is a nice treat I look forward to every year. For the year round beers, you cant beat the Hop Knot. It's a solid IPA but again, nothing out of the ordinary.  Biggest complaint: This place seems to do really well. Invest some of that money into an AC system. Its hard to hang out and enjoy yourself here in the summer when its 110 degrees outside. Perfect place to go Nov-April but its brutal in the summer.

Man, I love Pita Jungle. I found them as soon as I moved to the Valley in 96 and have been a customer ever since. The atmosphere is chill and the food is awesome. Get an order of the jalape√±o, cilantro hummus! It's pretty damn good! I've never ordered something I didn't love at Pita Jungle. Get in there!

Love the venue. Loved the music.   The security they have here is out of control.They make it very difficult to have a good time. From the invasive harassment at the front to the constant, in your face presence once inside the show, the security is there and they make sure you know it.   We all want to be safe at a show but when the security workers are complete dicks to everyone, it makes the venue suck. We want to come here, have fun and spend our money at your establishment. Management/ownership should take a look at whoever is in charge of security. They're driving your customers away!!

I've been going to Macayo's since I moved to the Valley in 96. Love this place. Great place to go for lunch, happy hour or dinner. They have great food, decent beer selection and its near the college. The salsa that they bring to the table is some of the best salsa around. Great balance of flavors and they keep bringing you more as your bowl runs dry.   If you're in Tempe and want some good local mexican grub....this is the spot!

These guys are awesome!!! Best Vet we've ever had. We have a Golden Retriever with thyroid issues and severe allergies. The doctors and staff are always very caring with our pets and our wallet. You truly get the sense that these guys love what they do and that they care for your pet. If you are anywhere in the East Valley, its worth the drive. Ask for Dr. Oliver.

I feel a little weird writing a review for a concept like Sonic. I mean, they're effing everywhere! If you dont know what sonic is or havent been to one, you need to get off the couch more.  Let me start by saying this. Its fast food. Theres nothing too special going on here with a couple of small but very important exceptions. The food, for the most part is unexciting. Decent burger, ok chili dog. What sets Sonic apart from the rest is the fact that they have tater tots!!!! Yes folks, tater tots. I'll eat their burger just to get to those crunchy, fried tots! They have an amazing drink selection too. They're deserts and shakes are on point if you need that late night sweet tooth fix.  So, over the past week, I've seen their commercials for their new line of hot dogs. I'm a sucker for a good Chicago dog. So I decided to pop into the local sonic today to give their new Chicago Dog a shot. I went in with ZERO expectations. I was blown away! They serve an amazing Chicago Dog. Dont believe me? Check it out for yourself. Good job, sonic! You nailed it!

San Tan Brewing Co. is Legit! They know what they're doing over there and it shows. They are hands down the best brew pub in AZ.   Heres the difference. Most breweries or brew pubs focus on their beer. As they should. San Tan puts as much thought into the food, the atmosphere, the music and branding as they do the beer and the beer is Damn Good! If you're a hop head, go straight for the Hop Shock. Best IPA in the state. If you like it a little mellow, go for the Sun Devil Ale or the Epicenter Amber. All are solid. We always take a growler with us so we can bring some home! My wife isnt really into beer but they have her covered with a couple of different flavored ciders.   The food is solid. For apps, try the hummus or the brewhouse nachos. All of the entres we've tried have been great. My personal recommendation is the Rib Eye Philly or the Chandler Street Tacos.  Get a seat out on the patio if its not too hot out. Great people watching on Friday and Saturday nights.  Keep up the Great Work, San Tan  8-13. Stopped in today for lunch. Got to meet the owner, Anthony. Great guy. Got a 6 pack of Hop Shock to go!!!

So, after reviewing some of my other reviews....I have to go back and give San Tan 5 stars. They've earned it! They are the best Brewery in the state and I cant have them with 4 stars while other, lesser breweries are hanging out with 4 stars...it just doesnt make sense.  They've also begun canning Hop Shock! Anyone wanna shotgun a beer?  LOVE that place!

We've been here several times and really like the food. We dont tend to take too many risks when it comes to sushi so we typically order what we like. Anything with tuna, crab, salmon etc...Starters and sides are always good. Everything is always on point.  With the name comes a little hook. The wasabi they serve is dyed blue which is kind of odd. If you put some wasabi in your soy sauce, like I do...It turns your rice blue and eventually....your teeth. Just odd. You can ask for natural green wasabi and they'll bring you some.  Like others have said, the drinks are a little light. If they loosen the bar up a little and bring me green wasabi....its all good. We'll be back

Floyd's is on point. They've got a hip feel to their shop, The people who work there seem to enjoy it and they have good music playing in the background. For a cut, wash, straight razor trim, hot towel and shoulder massage...for $21. Done. Write it up!

I dont know if its the quality of the food, the atmosphere or the great selection of beer here, but Dean and the rest of the people over at the Cornish Pasty Co. know what the hell they're doing! This place is awesome and if you've never been...get off your ass and check it out!  Growing up in Michigan, the pasty is somewhat of a local food (by way of English immigrants). If you're from northern Michigan, the pasty is nothing new to you. However, the pasties we grew up with are not the pasties they serve here. Dean has taken the idea of the traditional pasty and put a totally high end, almost gourmet twist into the mix. Look for southwestern and Greek flavors as well as traditional English and Italian pasties. The Oggie or O.G. is awesome. Simple, traditional and good.   The staff is friendly, helpful and colorful! Check out the juke box witch contains mostly, if not all British bands. Just another nice touch.  Ahhh a Pasty and a Pint! Life is good.

Well, I do like to get my massage on every once in a while. I should probably go more but dont make the time. Massage Envy is a great concept for a few reasons. 1. Its very affordable. First time visit is only $39. $39 for a 1 hour massage....are you kidding me? Thats awesome! 2. Locations. They're everywhere. Hey, look....theres one now! 3. They're legit. You dont have to feel shady going in and your wife doesnt have to wonder if you're getting a massage or a rub and tug!  The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 star rating...they're a little pushy with the close. They have a membership and they push that pretty hard. Hey, I know when I need a massage, I dont need to be "sold". If they could back off of this just a little, they'd be 5 star all the way.

Here's the 1. 2. 3...  1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job. 2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty. 3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno!   We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!  4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!

I'm a guy that likes a good taco. Id go so far as to say if given the choice of eating a good taco or something else...I'm probably going with the taco 9 times out of 10! I think I just had one of the best effin chicken tacos I've ever had!!  When you walk in, you think you're in for another Chipotle knock off. Although the place looks different, the mechanics are pretty much the same. Now I don't want to say anything about Chipotle but Cosat Vida makes Chipotle their bitch!!  Let's start with the foundation. The tortilla. They make their own tortillas and when you order a taco, they are grilled on the flat top twice. What you get is a soft taco that is kind of crunchy! Doesn't make sense, does it. Go. Try it. Its wonderful.  I ordered the chipotle chicken. The cipotle sauce was great with the chicken and tortilla.  My only complaint and the only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the salsa. I usually like or dislike a mexican restaurant based on their salsa. Theirs is chunky, bland and mild. Where's the heat? Where's the flavor. That's it. No further issues.   I'll be back to try their steak and their pork. Cant wait. If you're in the queen creek area, check this place out.

Just an update...I was so excited about this place that I took my wife there for lunch today. We were both underwhelmed. I ordered a salad and it just wasnt that great.The lettuce they use is very wet and the toppings were off a bit.  My wife ordered some tacos based on my recommendation. She thought they were good but not great. She did agree that the tortilla was awesome!  I'm starting to think I was just razzle dazzled by that first taco I had! I'm not giving up on you Costa Vida. I'll be back but only for your Chipotle Chicken Taco. You'll have to do some convincing to get me to try the other things on your menu.

OK...where to start. Its tough because I really wanted to like this place. We walk in the place at 7:00 and its dead. Smells funny too. Not a good start. We were drawn in by the draft beer selection (which is pretty stellar, by the way and the reason for the 2 stars!). Service was good. The food, not so much. We order buffalo burger because I've never met a buffalo burger I didnt like...until tonight. There were large raw chunks of meat in our burgers. Now, I know  a good burger is supposed to be medium but this wasnt pink, this was raw in the middle. No bueno. Bland. Salads were covered, let me repeat COVERED in dressing. Desert: cheese cake. The frozen kind that you thaw, cut and put strawberry sauce on. Not impressed but how do you mess up a frozen boxed cheese cake? The whole place is just a little off. You can tell they've put a lot of effort into it but.....something's just off.

We've been going to BJ's for years. Since the first on opened in AZ. This one just happens to be a little closer to where we live now so we go to this one more often than not.  There is some good and some bad here. Good: The food is usually pretty solid. Havent really had anything here that I was unhappy with. The menu is huge so if you come with a med-large party, theres going to be something for everyone. They have a good selection of beer and a full bar. They have a great Raspberry Cider that my wife loves! The bar area is great for happy hour and a game.  Bad: They call this a brewery...and it isnt. Its a restaurant that serves beer that the OTHER BJ's makes. This might not matter to you but it does to me. Weak! Because they're not an actual brewery, their liquor license is different and they cant fill the BJ's growler that I bought. Oh well, I'll use it to hold my change and I'll get my other growlers filled at real breweries. We've also experienced "Dirty Lines" here before. They should have their beer lines cleaned more often or more thoroughly or both.   Best part of the menu: Do not leave without having the Pizookie for dessert. It is one of the best things you can put in your mouth!

SDB is pretty solid. They have a good crew over their that really know their shit when it comes to good beer. These guys are not afraid to push the envelope a little. Their not afraid to make a BIG beer or something a little out of the ordinary. With their small batch releases, you know you're going to see or hear about something different each time you come in.   Try their sampler.   I was fortunate enough to be at their VIP event right before they opened. It's pretty cool to get a walk through of a brewery before it goes live!   Only  2 complaints and I'm sure they get this a lot.  1. No food! If you want food while you're there you have to bring it in or order delivery. There are options, but it would be a lot cooler if you could just order up some apps at the bar. 2. They dont fill growlers!!!! Come on! You're a brewery! Fill my damn growler!  Other than those two minor gripes, they're good. They make beer. good beer! Go get a pint...or 3.

This is a Great park! We go often to play disc golf. Its a challenging course, especially if its windy! Great views of the entire East Valley from up there. Gotta get the dogs over to check out this dog park. Looks like a lot of fun.  4-23-11. Hit up the dog park this weekend with all three of the doggies. Great park with plenty of playful, well behaved dogs. Love this park.

Do not take your car to this AAMCO! I've been there a few times and have not liked my experience any time I've been there. They always try the upsell and sometimes for things you dont even need.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt after the first visit. I came back a second time and felt the same vibe. The third and last visit is why I'll never go back.  I took my truck into have the AC looked at. It had been blowing hot for a few weeks. They looked at it and told me that that their was a leak in the condenser. They filled it with freon and said that the freon leaked out as fast as they put it in. They told me that it wasnt a good idea to replace just the condenser and that I should replace the whole ac system. The quote for this job: $1100!   I went and got a second opinion.  Turns out that the high pressure valve was worn out and needed to be replaced. I did the work myself. Part cost $6 and the freon to fill it cost around $30! AC blows ice cold now!!!!  AAMCO tried to STEAL over $1000 from me. Do not take your car here!

I LIKE it! Theres a good feel here. It reminds me of a bottle shop in Oregon. The owners are cool and their idea is on point. The bottle selection is great but you come here for draft! There is a good amount of cider on pull and a mead or two as well. I think once they have the food set up, these guys will have a GREAT spot out here. If I want a good beer and I'm in the E. Valley, this is probably where I'll be drinking it.

5 stars. This place is no joke. They do it right. All of the food is fresh and delicious. The service is great and the atmosphere is what you'd expect. You have to be willing to surrender your will to the chef but I can assure you that its worth it. We had no idea what was coming to the table but it was all awesome! We'll definitely be eating with the people at ShinBay again.

OK, you guys have some work to do. I visited this spot when it was Dave's, twice. Once to try it out for the first time and 2nd because I was hoping it wouldnt be as bad as the first time. Wrong! I was really hoping that when it switched ownership, things would improve. Wrong again!   The food: Simple bar food menu. Nothing special to make you want to come here. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger. It comes with fried onions on it, so I request no fried onions. They bring the burger out with no onions (thank you) but also, no BBQ sauce. Now, how am I supposed to enjoy my BBQ burger with no BBQ? The server was friendly but not very attentive. After I realized my burger didnt have BBQ sauce, I had to wait over 10 minutes for him to come back in our area, make eye contact and ask if we needed anything else. Fries are basic freezer to fryer shitty fries. Is it really that hard to slice a fresh potato and fry it?  The beer: Because, lets be honest, this is why we came. HORRIBLE. I enjoy a craft beer. Especially a local craft beer. Just because you buy a brew pub does not mean you are a brewer. You guys need to clean up your brewing or you're in trouble. We didnt even finish our first pint!!!! Literally the worst craft beer I've ever had. Location: This is where the 1 star comes from. This is a great location with a pretty sick patio. However, I dont think its enough to save these guys.....  I dont see going back to this spot until it changes ownership again which inevitably, it will.

I've been working some straight to the point reviews lately so I'm going to keep up with my current trend. Heres the 1,2,3.  The beer is on point! The Imperial IPA was the super star tonight. Just an amazing beer. All of the beer offerings were well made. Good stuff all the way around.  The pizza is MONEY!!! Wood fired, thin crust, fresh ingredients. This is what all other pizza wants to grow up to be! Possibly....the best pizza in Phoenix.Yeah, I effin said it! Loved it. We had a salad too. Great but completely overshadowed by the pizza.  Nice build out, comfortable atmosphere and friendly service. This is a great place. Check it out!
