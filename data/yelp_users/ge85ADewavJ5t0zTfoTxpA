Horrible experience! They delivered raw chicken wings and when I called to let them know the manager had an attitude and says, it happens all the time and it isn't raw but rather the bone is red. What?? That don't make any sense especially since I know what RAW chicken looks like. They could kill someone. I told her to just give me the credit and I will NEVER order from this location again. I would have let it go if she had been more cordial.

We knew we were going to purchase a mattress and a quality one, we just didn't know from where. I had heard good things about Mattress Firm. My husband and I went in and were able to spend some time trying out mattresses. The experience we had with Molly Burke at this location was awesome. She was informative and allowed us space to make the decisions we needed. Can't say enough great things about her and our experience!
