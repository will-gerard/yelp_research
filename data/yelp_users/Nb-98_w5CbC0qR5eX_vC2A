Sorry to say but I will never come back to this IHOP.  Not only did my friend and I wait for over 20 mins for our meal with only 8 others in the restaurant. People that came in after us got their meals before us.  We had to ask the waitress for a status update on our dishes.  After brining it to her attention she said it will be just a few more minutes. Once we got our dishes I was checking my dish and the vegitables were still frozen on my sandwich. At that point I advised her that I didn't want the dish at all.  There was not one apology for the wait or the frozen food.

The ladies at the front desk always have a smile on when I walk in the door. I've been a patient over half my life and still continue to come. Dr. Ferguson is great and the hygienists are A+ .

Awesome shop.  Great service,  Great prices,  Great people.  Have gone to the shop a few times for a few issues with my car.  They were able to fix everything that I had problems with and offered great prices.  It makes me feel very comfortable knowing I'm getting taken care of and I'm not getting taken for a ride.  (No pun intended) The best part of this shop is I hadn't been there I'm a year and when I walked in today the owner remembered my name.  It's a nice feeling to know I'm not just another client but a valued customer.  Keep up the great work 29th Street Auto.
