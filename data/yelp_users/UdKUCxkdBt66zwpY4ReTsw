The drive thru line is foreverrrrrr long...but I can't fault them for that. The staff is extremely friendly, especially the smiling faces at the drive thru window. Love that this is my "home" starbucks.

I ordered the oatmeal with strawberries and blueberries. The oatmeal seemed fresh, and not too soggy like most restaurants. The fruit was fresh cut, which I appreciated.   I'm a huge orange juice fanatic and theirs is far from fresh and definitely tasted like it was from concentrate. Boo   The waitress was efficient, but not overly friendly.   If they step up their orange juice game I will return.

This is the best nail salon in Arizona. Always clean, and everything is kept perfectly in it's place. Mindy does my nails and she is the absolute best! My polish never chips and lasts forever. They offer water bottles, tea and coffee if you want. The price is reasonable for all the massaging you get! I will never go to another nail salon again, so thankful I found this gem!

Hard to go wrong with anything you order here. The line can get long during peak times, but don't stray because it goes very fast and is worth the wait. They recently changed their iced tea section and it is sooooo much better now. The pressed farmer sandwich is outstanding as a vegetarian option, and the burger of the week always packs a ton of flavor and variety.  If you like coffee, try the cortadito. It is simply delicious and the presentation makes you feel like you are at a quaint Cuban cafe.   The desserts are to die for, especially the huge cinnamon rolls. The rice pudding is technically considered a "side dish" but it could definitely double as a dessert.   Make a trip to the bathroom to see the unique decor. One bathroom even has recipes written all over the walls in the most tasteful way you could imagine. I am a detail oriented person and Liberty market has so many quirky details that I love discovering!   The parking can be a pain sometimes with all of the recent development in downtown Gilbert, but there is a new garage going up and a little stroll along the historic area isn't so bad.   I take all our out of town guests here to eat, you should too!

I can always count on joes BBQ to be consistent in taste, temperature, and price. I am never disappointed and I love that their staff all seems so happy to be at work. The cashier has been the same one since I first discovered this place about 8 years ago, which says a lot. I eat here and I use them to cater parties at my house a few times a year. Perfect for large groups with a varying demographic of picky eaters, kids, and even the hard to please complainers. Everyone always loves Joe's!

The woman i corresponded with was so friendly and accommodating! I called with only a week in advance to rent a Rockwall and a bounce house for my son's birthday. She helped me decide on the perfect bounce house, and made the process so easy.  They brought the bounce house early to set up, and then brought the Rockwall early too! All the staff was so respectful and kind to my guests and I. Bounce house was clean and kept the kids highly entertained.   I will be using this company for many years to come!

Avocados here are hands down the BEST in Gilbert. Granted, at $3 a piece, they sure better be, but non the less they are always perfection. The cashiers on the other hand, are not as appealing. It's as if they are being held there against their will and taking it out on the customers. They need a customer service seminar to teach them it's okay to be friendly. If the avocados weren't so good, I would never deal with those grumps again.

In the past few months, I have seen some new smiling, friendly faces manning the registers and restocking the produce. It is a welcomed change, as my last rating was so low because of the poor attitudes of the staff. The personnel that is still the same has become seemingly happier and more welcoming. Hopefully they have been reading customer feedback and realized life is too short to be miserable. Whatever works! Im happy to adjust my rating because they adjusted their outlooks on life(and the avocados are still the best in town).

Every person that works here says hello. Whether they are stocking the Pringles or behind the register, they seem to be genuinely glad I am at their Walgreens. There are two main pharmacists that seem very quick and efficient and are always there. They double check dosage and drug allergies for my two young children, which I appreciate so much. I feel at home when I come in or drive thru the pharmacy. Love the "be well" slogan that they sing out to me as I depart their store, too! Customer service award deserved for this store!

Was hoping that the patio would've been open with the heaters working, but no such luck. Came here Friday night for a friends birthday. Definitely an older crowd that came late for the early bird special... The server lacked a personality and a smile from the second he came to the table.  We had heard so much about the "popovers" but when they arrived an hour into our meal, after requesting them four times, the outside was burnt. Talk about disappointment.  I ordered the beet salad. It arrived drowning in dressing that overpowered any other flavors that once existed in this salad turned soup. Blah.  I ordered the sole as my entree. Way overpriced, and far too much salt. Clearly you should stick with the steaks. The side of carrots were pleasing and the Prisoner red wine is always a sure thing at any restaurant.    Overall: I would likely never dine here again. The atmosphere was drab, the food was disappointing and the service was depressing.

Initially met Dr. Saba at the hospital when he did the welfare check of our newborn son. Love him, and his bedside manner and sense of humor. Too bad the front office staff as well as the billing woman are miserably rude. I have been to 6 wellness visits with my son so far and each time I had to wait at least 45 minutes to see the doctor. Just last week, I waited 40 minutes in the waiting room and decided enough was enough after having my healthy child sit amongst a revolving door of sick and coughing children with no end in sight or update from the front desk girl. Sad that I have to find another pediatrician, because he wasn't the problem, the overbooking and front end staff was.

So convenient to pop in here, and literally buy an outfit right off the manikin for a last minute date night, or pick up a unique gift for a girlfriends birthday party. The clothes selection is constantly changing, and there are lots of sales. Everything is separated by colors which makes it easy to narrow things down and get the most use of your time. The quality is also impressive, and seems to hold up to washing and normal wear and tear much better than most trendy boutique clothes I have found elsewhere.

After what seemed like a life long Marriage to my previous waxer, she moved and I was forced to find someone new. What I thought would be a daunting and painful experience, turned out to be easy and enjoyable! I found my new go-to girl, Erika, at the Dana Park European Wax center. She made me feel comfortable, she had lots of pride in her work, and she is a super skilled waxer! I highly recommend her!

Came here at 9pm on a Tuesday and had the whole place to ourselves. I got the pecan bar, my husband got the seasonal blueberry lemonade. Both were unique, and packed a lot of fresh flavor. The pecan is a good sweet/savory flavor while the blueberry lemonade was tart and refreshing.  It was clean, well kept, and the cashier was super friendly. I left feeling like my sweet tooth was totally satisfied without the fatty feeling you get after Ice cream. I can already predict what I will be craving the next time I get pregnant. Paletas!

This was my third time, and I just keeping chasing the high that was my first time at Arrogant Butcher. Looking like I will never get the quality that I got the first go around. I ordered the scallop dish and the first time it was amazing. One of the best all around dishes I had ever had. The second visit I ordered them, and they were raw in the middle. Fluke perhaps? Last night I gave it another go and the vegetables were undercooked and the scallops were chewy. Sad, really. I seek out restaurants with consistent food quality. This is another to add to the list of unpredictable, sub par meals.   Plus side: Waitress was friendly and relatively fast. The Pinot noir wine offered is one of my favorite bottles ever. The ice water is good, and thankfully doesn't have a weird taste that is commonly found in restaurant water.   Was hoping that the third time would be the charm but sadly, I don't think I will go back for a fourth.

I was so excited to try Urban Picnic. I walked in and could tell they were short staffed right away. The girl behind the register was also the runner for the food so she was alternating back and forth. Dark clouds on the horizon.   Constructive criticism: They need to invest in a large version of their menu, simply stapling their paper Togo menu to the wall was confusing and hard to read. Choose a different corner to cut.  I ordered the veggie pressed sandwich and the kids Mac n' cheese. My friend ordered a salad and a kids meal as well. Her food came out in 20 minutes, and mine was FAR behind. 35 minutes later, my "hot pressed" sandwich came out completely cold in the middle. Disappointing and gross. I went to refill my ice tea, they were out. Bummer. I didn't even eat the sandwich, and left hungry.   All signs of my experience point to simply being under staffed. I saw a total of three humans trying to man this sinking ship. Based on the previous reviews, it seems like this was a fluke. Hopefully.

Acai bowls hand crafted and fresh! Love how clean this place always is, and how consistent the bowls always are. They never skimp on fruit, and the taste is always yummy! Only bummer is the wait time can get a little frustrating.

It was after normal business hours on a weekday, and I needed somewhere to take my 4 year old to confirm my suspicions about him having strep throat. Normally, we go to he's pediatrician but his suffering couldn't wait until tomorrow. I used the yelp app, and sought out this urgent care based on the reviews and the incentive that said if I "checked in" I would receive a voucher for an "in-house prescription". Done. So I buckled up the kids and drove over, checked in and the nurse practitioner confirmed that he would need antibiotics to fight off his bacterial infection. She asked if I wanted to have them fill his prescription there. Sure! That's convenient! I even told her that I had this voucher from yelp, and she said I could show it when I checked out to redeem it. On the track to a five star review so far....  Then... I get to the check out desk and show my voucher, and the girl tells me that because I had been to their urgent care before (once 3 years ago) I was not eligible for the voucher. She was firm on this and didn't bother to get a manager, or show any concern at all. It wasn't as if I had already used this voucher and I was trying to double dip or abuse the system. I felt like I was doing them a favor by checking in, promoting their business and was prepared to write an outstanding review after my appointment but then they blindside me with this awful ending. And for that reason, I will make a point to never return to this dishonest urgent care. They lure you in, and then don't follow through with offers they extend through the very app that consumers use to rate them! Unreal that when it came down to it, customer service is NOT their top priority.

Took the advice of other yelpers and got here right at noon on Saturday when they opened. When I first drove up, it didn't have much curb appeal but I trusted yelpers to not judge a book by it's cover.  Check in was fast, the front desk lady, also doubled as the nurse who took my sons vitals. She was so sweet. The doctor came in, assessed my son, gave me a solid diagnosis and treatment and I was in and out in less than 30 minutes! Wow!   I was also pleased when the nurse told me that Dr.Phillips also works at Banner Cardon's Children's hospital as the ER pediatrician. Extra qualified! So, it's the knowledge equivalence of a hospital, but with the urgent care copay. Sold.   Not hoping to have to return to an urgent care, but I know when I do, it will be this one.

My son has been attending Spondeo for the past two and a half years and we absolutely love it! If you have been looking for a preschool for your child, seriously look no further.   Spondeo is a true Montessori preschool. This really sets up an environment where the children can develop and learn on their own terms. It is neat to see which "work" my son naturally gravitates to. The teachers are all well educated in the Montessori method, as well as early childhood development. Standards are high to be a teacher here, which I really appreciate! When a problem arises, the teachers will guide the student toward brainstorming better solutions or ways to handle the conflict, rather than telling them outright what to do. They teach kindness.   My son has become so confident since coming here. At first I was surprised at his eagerness to go to school everyday after staying home with me for nearly three years but now I understand why he loves it so much. They give him the freedom to be himself, express himself, and encourage him to always be the best person he can be.   I also like that they organize a lot of neat events like the yearly carnival, doughnuts with Dad's, muffins with Mom's, and the spring picnic. I feel like it's a community, rather than just a school.   The standards for their food, is also very high. They cook organic lunches with no refined sugars, preservatives, or artificial fillers. The pride in the food they feed the kids is so impressive.  The only negative thing about spondeo is that it isn't K-12, because I am dreading having to enroll him in another school. :(

Wow. The absolute BEST fettuccine Alfredo I have ever had in my life. And I have been all over Italy! Every bite of this dish melted in my mouth. Best Italian food in this country, can't believe it's in my backyard here in Gilbert!

After having a baby, I wanted to get back in shape but didn't want the hassle of going to a massive gym and figuring out a routine. With sleepless nights from a newborn baby, I wanted someone to tell me what to do and how to do it. I came to the right place. It's like mindless working out, with over the top results. I was dedicated to showing up, and the trainers helped with the rest. Meal plans, encouragement, motivation....all it takes is work ethic on your part! Ask questions if you are lost, come early or stay after and get clarification. It's fast moving, and leaves no time wasted. The results are fabulous, and I am back to pre-baby body in just 2 months of orange theory! It works!

I love everything about this healthy lunch spot. It's convenient and so super fast. I have never waited longer than 5 minutes in line, which is nice with two kids in the car. There ingredients are always fresh and I trust the food I'm eating is top quality.   I especially love the southwest salad and the Asian salad. The Serrano like dressing is absolutely delicious! My 4 year old always gets a smoothie and polishes off the entire thing before we even get home. Just recently got breakfast here and the quinoa bowl and yogurt parfait were top notch. Never disappoints, and flavors are always consistent.

I called the number listed on their website on a Friday night at about 7pm, expecting to leave a message on their answering machine. Much to my surprise Allan answered and talked me through my bug issue and had his brother Charlie come out the following Monday to spray.   Quick, efficient and so over the top friendly. Other companies take note of Green Ninja's stellar customer service and work ethic. Happy customer here!

Started with the guacamole last night, which was delightful. Lots of flavor and crunchy texture from the onions and cilantro. Ordered a strawberry fresca and it delighted my taste buds. I didn't even feel bad drinking it because it is just pure yummy juice....no artificial colors or flavors...just strawberry goodness over ice!  For my entree, I ordered a salad. I can't remember the name now, but I did take a photo to add to my review of how perfect it looked when it arrived. It tasted as good as it looked. I added chicken to it, which was too seasoned for my taste, but the rest of the salad was killer. So many unique flavors combining together that each bite tasted better than the last. The dressing came on the side and I didn't even use it! That should tell you how natural packed the salad was with flavor. This will be my go to salad for sure. I'll update my review next time with the name of it. (Yelper fail)  The manager came over to check on us multiple times and was so eager to make sure our experience was on point. One of the most involved, and active upper management people I have come across in all my years of dining out. He really made us feel like we were old friends of his, eating at his personal restaurant. Lots of pride in what he does, and what his restaurant serves. HE is what set my review over the top and puts Joyride at a solid 5. I will also figure out the managers name and update this review with that as well. Clearly I was in some sort of food heaven/coma that gave me amnesia of the specifics of my review. Non the less- go here if you want CLEAN modern Mexican food.

This place is consistently great. Love the simplicity of the menu at lunch, and the flavor from each bowl I have ordered. Today was the ramen with chicken broth, sprouts, Bok choy, lemongrass chicken, mushroom and egg. The broth alone is worth it. Packed full of flavor and thankfully they give you a soup spoon so you can savor every last drop. Also try the grapefruit lemongrass soda if they have it (flavor changes). Service is prompt and these guys really have mastered the art of ramen bowls. One of my go-to spots for sure! I will update my review when I make it here for dinner fare.

Came here for Valentine's Day Brunch. They quoted an hour wait but sat us in 20 minutes. Excellent first impression.  Ordered the grapefruit to Begin and it was like creme brûlée - only, no guilt. Yum!   My husband got a custom Bloody Mary from the man pushing around a cart of every type of infused vodka you could want, with toppings and spices galore. He said it was de-lish.   For our main course, I ordered the flower child omelet which was incredible. It had butternut squash, which I was skeptical about initially but it made the omelet so unique! The potatoes were over cooked and blah, so I would suggest subbing for fruit.   My husband ordered the quinoa breakfast burrito and I was having trouble prying it from his deadlocked fingers for a bite. It was so tasty! Packed a lot of southwestern flavors and the avocado was the icing!   My friend ordered the chicken fried chicken and he was the first one done. He said he would most likely dream about that meal later in his sleep. I didn't try it, but the presentation was cute with the eggs on top. Very "brunch".   Highly, highly recommend!!

Wow. I wish I could have given an extra bonus star to this review.   I have used a different cake company for years up until recently when they were not returning my call. Desperate to find a new creative cake bakery, I drove by Lesley's shop on Baseline road. Fate. I gave her a call, and explained my situation and that I needed a super unique cake for the weekend, which was 4 days away. She responded with "no problem! I'll even have it done a day early!" Music to my ears!!! I told her the theme of my son's birthday (locks and keys) and i let her run wild with whatever she wanted to come up with. The Master lock cake she made was so realistic and well made, not to mention, it tasted so yummy with the fresh strawberry layers! It was a HUGE hit with my son and the entire party. Everyone couldn't even believe it was a cake!! Mission accomplished! Oh! And when the cake was ready, she called and let me know I could pick it up, and even offered to deliver it to my house! Above and beyond anything I expected. I highly recommend Lesley's creative cakes to ANYONE and EVERYONE looking for a memorable cake for any special occasion.

Sometimes, even when I'm not thirsty, I drive thru my local Dutch brothers just to restore my faith in humanity. Everyone there is all smiles and gives off an incredible amount of positive energy. The ice tea, and attention for even my 4 year old son is what brings me back. Well done, Dutch Bros!

Had to take up temporary residence here after a flood disaster at our home. The two bedroom suite with a kitchen was perfect for my husband and I, two young children and Grandma (who was visiting from out of town). The rooms were clean and well kept, and the free breakfast was much better than your average run of the mill cereal bar. The pool and jacuzzi were relaxing and clean, and the lobby staff always greeted us with a bright smile. I would highly recommend this hotel.

Wow, what an incredible experience. Top notch service from the doorman, to the hostess, to the server, and the manager. All were so helpful and genuinely cared about my party's over all experience. The drinks were beyond beautiful, and tasted like an explosion of flavors in my mouth. I highly recommend anything containing passionfruit! This is a hidden gem in Phoenix, and they truly take pride in the exceptional service they offer. Blown away, and will be recommending to anyone and everyone visiting downtown.

Wow. Where do I even begin? The decor, the atmosphere, the friendly faces, the yummy food, the fresh teas and juices, the clean bathroom, the outdoor seating...the list goes on and on. What a well done restaurant! The attention to detail and thought that went into this place is incredible.   Okay, let me be more specific. You are greater with fruit infused water as you walk into this airy, organic vortex. Fresh flowers peppered all over the place. I ordered the mix and match consisting of sweet corn and quinoa, sweet potatoes, and the beat, avocado, and citrus salad. A world tour for my pallet! Everything was distinctly different, and uniquely great tasting! I tried the green tea, and also had a taste of the lemonade. Both were a ten.   I cannot wait for my next meal here! This is by far the BEST Fox restaurant so far. Wow. Just wow.

So happy there is a location in Chandler now! I'm hopeful that their next location will open up in Dana Park on Val Vista and baseline. ;) (hint, hint) Anyway, on to the review.  I love this location, and the fact that they left the building's historical details in tact like the banks vaulted door. It has a ton of room, cute bar, and plenty of outdoor seating.   I ordered a protein bowl with the forbidden rice and shrimp. It was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. I also ordered iced tea and was thrilled at the options they had to choose from. I went with the blackberry and it didn't disappoint.   My son ordered the cold buster fresh pressed juice. He LOVED it, and he is 4 years old. Great way to trick your kids into drinking something super healthy.   Overall, a clean, friendly, and happy environment. Will be a regular fo' sho.

Sam Fox comes to Gilbert!!!! Yayyyy!!!!  ^that was my initial feeling prior to dining at the highly anticipated Zin burger. I dined here opening week, and again three days ago as a second chance in hopes the kinks would be worked out. Not so much.   The servers on both occasions seemed unfamiliar with the menu specifics and lacked the confidence and personality I am used to from the other Fox Concepts.   Both visits I ordered the same thing....sweet potato fries and the garden vegetable salad. The fries keep this review afloat. They are perfectly crisp, and the dipping sauce is nothing you would expect but everything you would want. Yum. Order two servings.   The garden vegetable salad has all the makings of a vegetarians dream, with the added bonus of the almighty quinoa to boost the protein. Too bad they DRENCH it in salad dressing. I had to actually spit it out because the dressing was so potent. Pools of it in the bowl and the spinach looked like seaweed from being so wet. I asked to have another one with out the dressing and it took them 25 minutes to bring the new one. The manager didn't verbally address me, or the soup....I mean, salad. She did comp the salad, but I have no incentive to go back for another round of this. My husband is probably accurate when he said "you can't order a salad when you go to a burger place".

Went here for cinco de mayo today and was overwhelmed with excitement that this location is finally open in Gilbert!!!  We were greeted by a super hip and friendly hostess that seated us inside at one of the roomy booths. I ordered an unsweetened passion fruit iced tea that needed no sweeter at all. Yum! The waiter told us that they have one of the largest tequila selections in the country so if you are in the market for a margarita, this is definitely your spot.  Started with the guacamole. It had a wide variety of ingredients that were unique to your normal run of the mill guac. They could add an extra avocado half to the mix to increase the portion size, but the flavor was packed in!  We had the tacos and to my pleasant surprise, they were on sale because it was "taco Tuesday"! Bonus! So I split an order with my Dad. He got the barrio pollo and I got the shrimp and grilled fish. All delicious in their own distinct ways. Be warned that they are small, about the size of your palm.   I ordered a cheese quesadilla and black bean kids meal for my son and it was plenty of food.   Since they just opened, they don't have the full menu available yet, so I am looking forward to coming back and updating my review after trying an entree!
