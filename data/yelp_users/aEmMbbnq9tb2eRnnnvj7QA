I expected to have a better experience. I ordered an Almond Orchata, there was no almonds in my orchata, there were pecans that's to start the second con is that it was loaded in cinnamon and I mean loaded, I love cinnamon but this was exagerated amount in my drink, it was hard to drink it. I ordered the chipotle chicken tamales, hmmm they weren't seasoned as I would expect, actually I did not find the chipotle in my chicken and the third comment is that we ordered the hot habanero salsa and it was not hot at all :( . The service was a little slow but I understand it was a crowded friday night, if the waitress would be a little more friendly I wouldn't mind that detail.  The place is nice to go out, the food not so good to my mexican palate, the drinks I would give them a second chance, perhaps.

Dr Guzman has been my obgyn since Dante was born, he is a very caring Dr , always explain to me everything with detail, he is never in a rush with me. I am very happy with the kind of Dr he is. Most of the nurses are very nice.
