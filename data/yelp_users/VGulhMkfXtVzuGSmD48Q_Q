This is  a family favorite, We have eaten in  - but typically get take out. They have our order (for 6 - so not quick and easy!) ready in 10-15 minutes every time. We have to be ready to leave the house before we call!  Great orange chicken - fam fave! I also love the beef and veggies. The food is always fresh and hot. I've yet to be disappointed!  Wish they had a buffet so I could try it all!

Horrible horrible experience here. Worst I've had in my life as far as customer service. Ordered pizza delivery 2x no problem. 3rd time (with 4 kids waiting to eat) they no showed. We called after an hour and they said "oh we don't deliver to your house, its out of our range". 2.5 miles. Never called to tell us they weren't coming. Just decided not to. Then proceeded to lie to my better half and tell him that they called me, finally admitted lying. But what can you do but make sandwiches at that point?

Great food - really feel like I'm south of the border here. The staff is friendly, love to share their ideas - try hard  - and create exactly what you want. I am a sucker for a great bean and chz burrito (I know - pretty basic). But...oh my gosh... delicious! Tortillas are authentic. Salsa amazing. The only reason for less than 5 stars is the atmosphere (bright, cheap tables and chairs). For the food itself, I'd give a 5.  Thrifty ice cream, assorted treats, fresh juices that are delicious!, strawberries and cream, etc.

This is a great day to waste an afternoon! Bring a few people, sit at a picnic table with your toes in the sand and drink in your hand.  I give the atmosphere 10 stars, the food is 'good' - 'fine' - I sure wouldn't complain... or brag. My better half thinks the food is amazing.  If you want to meet friends - this is a great place, Large picnic tables that easily fit 8 - 10. No wait usually for a 'big group'. Little kids can play in the sand by you - big kids play bean bag or  catch. We always let the 9 year old bring his football and he can usually find some friends and pick up a game.
