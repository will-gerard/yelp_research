I took two of my girlfriends for one of those "lets grab a bite before the movie" lunches and planned to order my usual hummus and grilled chicken. Instead the waiter started listing the specials which included a lot of terms like "flavor profiles" and "siracha sauce" The three of us were so mesmerized by his descriptions that we abandoned our menus and told him to bring us whatever he wanted. We proceeded to savor the most amazing flavors and gorgeous presentations imaginable and by the end of the meal we were all in a foodie daze. None of us even thought about getting popcorn at the movie! Not sure what is going on in the kitchen a PJ, these days, but I like it. If you keep this up, you may need to start using tablecloths...

When one of our spa guests asked me yesterday where she could get a gluten-free pizza that tasted good, I couldn't wait to tell her about True Foods! My girlfriends and I had eaten there last week and we couldnt believe our luck. We had the mediteranean salad which was a revelation, and the kale pesto pizza with sun dried tomatoes. Who knew good food could taste this good?! As the owner of Arizona's largest freestanding resort-style spa, guests expect me to eat healthy. Now I actually want to!   Heidi Lamar, Spa Lamar

I can't believe it took me so long to try this place! The fondue was delish and came with sausage, bread and fresh pears. The pate was so incredible I almost forgot I was eating rabbit. The meatloaf is big enough for two and looks like a decadent dessert. Speaking of dessert, if you don't have room, be sure to take home a bag of bacon pecan brittle. YUM. Everything was perfect from the service to the presentation. Great food. Friendly atmosphere. Amazing value!!

A deliciously creative and tasty twist on beer garden fare!  Loved everything about this place. Fun atmosphere, friendly servers and food that makes me want to join an oompah band.  The pretzel and beer cheese dipping sauce were a chewy, savory start to my meal. It was so good I almost ordered another for my main. Thankfully, I resisted the urge, which was a good thing because it left room for the brat sliders, the Belgian fries with blue cheese dipping sauce and the drunken date cake! Luckily I had a 16 oz hard cider to wash it all down with...  This was one of the best casual German dining adventures I have ever had. And that means a lot from a girl named Heidi!

We were celebrating a friends birthday tonight so I thought I would honor his aging with a little child like ordering of my own. I had the PB&J Bacon Burger. It is exactly what it sounds like: creamy peanut butter and grape jelly melting over a juicy beef patty with hearty bacon slices. There is also a little sirano chili in the mix to further confuse your taste buds. It was served with sweet potato tots and a pineapple dipping sauce. I washed it down with a Corona Rita. I probably won't do this one again, because there are so many other great burgers on the menu I want to try next but if you are a little brave and very hungry, give this one a go. It will make you feel like a kid again.

I just discovered this neighborhood gem and it is a fun new addition. The color coded plate system, affordable prices, grab and go conveyor system and sushi description sheet make this the perfect starter place for sushi newbies. I brought a raw-phobic sushi virgin and she loved it, because she was able to tell from the description card which selections were made with raw fish so she could stick to the veggie and cooked options.   It might not be the best sushi on the planet but it is deffinitely the best sushi deal! It is also a quick and affordable lunch option because you don't have to wait for  a server.  Oh, just a word of warning. If you accidentally grab a bowl of edamame beans and it slips out of your hand and spills all over the conveyor belt and gets stuck in the cracks of the track when it gets to the corner and the track jams and the plates start stacking up you should scoop them up like Lucy at a chocolate factory before the whole train derails and everyone notices. On the plus side you will enjoy the wide variety of dishes that pass by during the rest of your meal with edamame garnish on the side. I mean when is the last time you saw cream puffs with edamame?

Ever order at the counter at Wild Flower or Pei Wei, only to find there is no where to sit down? This hip new burger bar takes counter service to the next level. Staff, wearing T-shirts with slogans like "because your mine, I walk the line" greet you in line, and hand you a ticket with your reserved table number. Want a specific table? No worries, they will save it for you.   The special of the day was a "Boris" which piled tender pastrami and juicy sour krout on top of a tasty chicken burger. It came on a super soft freshly baked bun with lettuce, tomato and onion for $9. Fries were $3 more but they were thin, crispy and had bits of parsley mixed in. Very tasty.   The drink options include choices like Blueberry Root  giving their self service fountain a fun twist but there is a single Diet Coke option hidden among the more adventurous flavors. (I found this out when in a panic I asked a passing bus girl "what if I just want a Diet Coke?!" and she replied "then you push the Diet Coke button")  The milk shake flavors go way beyond strawberry, chocolate and vanilla with options like Red Velvet and Sea Salt Caramel. I actually tasted chunks of sea salt in mine! There is no $5 value menu here. The total for a burger, fries, soda and shake came to just over $20, for one person, but it was enough to share which I did. What? did you really think I ate all that by myself? Don't answer that.  PS I saw an interesting drink go by on a tray, which looked like a frozen margarita with a full upside down Corona bottle sticking out of it. Turns out it was exactly what it looked like. It is called a Skinny Dip. Apparently the beer empties into your glass as you drink your margarita. Hmmm might have to "share" that one next time....

TOTAL BAIT AND SWITCH!!!  When one of our customers locked their keys in their locker at our spa, our usual locksmith was not able to come out so we found 24/7 on line. They said the service call rate would be $19.95 and the usual rate to open a locker is $30-$50 depending on the equipment.  We usually pay this much so I told him to come over. When he arrived the guest was anxiously waiting to get into her locker and he told us the charge would be $170 because our lockers were "antique" (They were new in 1997). With the guest standing there listening, I couldn't really argue. He had the locker opened in under 1 minute and then he gave me a bill for $187 including tax and said he didn't have the equipment to make a key. If he wasn't wearing a shirt with 24/7 logo on it I would question if he was even a legit employee. He called in to charge my credit card and gave me a receipt with no company name or contact info on it.

This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite Happy Hours (and in Scottsdale, that is saying a lot!) The food is fresh and mostly organic. The servers are friendly and helpful. The drinks are top shelf ie Tito's martinis and the soft seating on the patio is super comfy!

My manager has been nagging me to try this place since it opened so when I went for lunch with a girlfriend the other day, I was hungry but not sure what to expect. After the most amazing toasted bread with olive oil and melt in your mouth ravioli, I told our server "this reminds me so much of Tomasos" He said "it should, it's his recipe!" We have been staying for years that our only complaint about Tomasos is that it is such a long drive. Finding it a couple miles from work is like a dream come true!

The margarita was delightful. The food, not so much. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. The grilled skirt steak was neither tender nor tasty but the complimentary chips and salsa were good so I used the salsa to add some flavor to the meat.   We have all been so excited to see a fresh new restaurant in our neighborhood. They have done such a great job with the decor and we were really hoping the food would be as good. Sadly, our first impression was not stellar.  The place was pretty empty when I was there and I feel bad for the owners. The first few months in a new place are so important for it's success and things just don't look all that hopeful.  We may try it again but right now, the thought of going back just makes me feel kind of sad.  Please, please, please turn things around. We really WANT to support a great restaurant in our neighborhood!!

I Just Don't Get it. There has been so much hype about this place, I was really looking forward to trying it.  I was shopping at a nearby store when a Jimmy Johns delivery person dropped a lunch off for the woman at the register. The woman said she had ordered from them every day since they opened and she was really excited because she rarely had time to leave for lunch.   I drove straight over to see what ll the fuss was about. I ordered a sandwich and was surprised to find it wrapped and waiting at the other end of the counter before I had time to put my credit card away. I unwrapped the speedy sandwich, eager to bite into the bread I had heard so much about. Sadly it was dry and disappointing. It might have been wrapped at warp speed but it definitely wasn't fresh. I went back to the counter to see if there was anything they could do to help and they handed me a packet of mayo.   During the time it took me to choke down my sad sandwich, I was the only person seated in the place. The tables and floors in the dining area were  really dirty. Crumbs and garbage on the floors and tables, but no one came out from behind the counter to clean up the mess. There was one customer who came in for take out while I was there.   Maybe that is the attraction. If you want take out or can't leave work and need delivery this probably beats starvation but not by much. The quality and service I have gotten at Subway is much better.  I am hoping that maybe they were just working out the kinks of opening a new location. I have never been to a Jimmy Johns before but if this is what its like, I wouldn't bother.
