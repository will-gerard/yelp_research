A solid brunch place!   - Busy but not TOO busy, with no wait on a late Saturday morning - Coffee mugs are ginormous and plenty to last through the meal - Tons of choices too chose from. Thoroughly enjoyed my huevos rancheros. Three overeasy eggs atop a whole wheat tortilla with refried beans and salsa....I'm salivating just thinking about it. Other great options range from crepes to amazing looking omelettes, even breakfast burritos - Prices are reasonable for brunch: $8-$13 per plate - Service was attentive and friendly, although I felt slightly rushed with the busboys hawking over me  Minus one star because we ended up waiting pretty long for our food to come out...makes no sense especially when neighboring tables get served faster?   Will definitely come back again and look forward to trying other items on their interesting menu.

3 cantaloupes for a buck?? SOLD!  If you're obsessed with produce as much as I am, Sprouts is the hippest spot in town! Similar to Henry's back in the C of A, this place is legit with their freakin' amazing deals (ahem..double ad WEDNESDAYS...)  You got your plethora of organic fixin's, but I'm all about the deals deals deals...  Fruits are jaw droppin cheap.. So many veggies to choose from, you might as well become a vegetarian! Even asparagus goes on sale!  And cmon'...bulk items? Stock up on them gummy bears...need a cup of brown sugar? Done! A teaspoon of dried parsley? You got it! I am particularly fond of their cranberry trail mix with a drooling combination of candied pecans, chocolate chips, cranberries, cashews and honey roasted peanuts...  To Sprouts for reeediculously cheap produce that makes me giddy every Wednesday, cheers to you!

.......Where are the chopsticks?  A Chinese restaurant is clearly not Chinese when there are no chopsticks on the place setting! Tea was lukewarm upon arrival, tasted unauthentic, with the help of any ambiguous American tea bag. The hot and sour soup had peas...peas! Side of rice was stiff and tasted as if it had been in the cooker all day. Had the stir fry vegetable dish that consisted of broccoli, snow peas and mushrooms overly cooked to mush; where was my bok choy or kai lan or any type of actual authentic Chinese vegetables?!  One thing I do give them credit for: service was clean, fast, and efficient.  Other than that, your money's better off at Panda Express right down the street. Same quality of food, and at least there you won't have to pay for tip!

After hearing so much hype about this Phoenix "staple", decided to give it a try on a Saturday lunch. Came late, so fairly empty with workers wrapping up the lunch rush. A ton of samples, more than enough to fill your appetite. Let's break it down:  Sandwiches: Dunno why they were in such a rush, there was no one around. Was not asked if my sandwich was here/to-go, so they sloppily threw together my veggie sandwich together and wrapped it. By the time I opened it (uhh...3 minutes later), my bread had already been nasty SOAKED by the overly soggy roasted red peppers. Gross.  Salad: If you call dumping a bunch of unappetizing bland lettuce together and slabbing 2 scoopfuls of excessively- mayoed "chicken walnut salad" on top a "salad", and charge me almost 8 bucks? Seriously?  Soup: I could whip up the same crap from my kitchen with a can of Cambell's tomato soup and 3 cups of Morton salt.   Cookies: Alright, I'll give them some credit.   Don't waste your time and money. Unless you're really dying from some lard-filled cookie craving.

Fail...AGAIN!  Any place that charges 8 whopping dollars for a horrendous meatLESS half sandwich and disappointing tasteless soup deserves not even a cent from me.   Attempt 1: ordered a cranberry turkey sandwich on white bread with no mayo. Received: cranberry turkey sandwich on wheat bread with slabs of mayo; let me add: was pre-made! They didn't even bother reading my request!  Attempt 2: ordered a cranberry turkey sandwich AGAIN...this time with no special treatment. Received: shockingly sloppy job of throwing together ONE thinnnn slice of turkey barely held together by a toothpick.  Overrpiced, overrated, under par. The lines are too long at lunch, the prices are too high and the people are too pretentious.  Disappointed time and time again, I hope to not return as long I can can walk my butt over to where my skinny wallet is appreciated more: to the land of the 5 dollar footlongs.

Woohoo what a gem! If you're looking for a superb restaurant on the Vegas strip, look no more, this place is it!  Swung by on a Saturday night with reservations (recommended), greeted by the awesomest of hostesses and servers who know their food. Kicked off the night with a small bottle of Chianti wine, recommended by server. Appetized the dinner with the stone crab cocktail, which is a MUST-GET, amazing texture with a nice hint of lemon and their mustard sauce ..yumm.  For our main courses, we had the Filet mignon which was cooked to near perfection with a seafood salad, a generous portion of lobster, crab and shrimp with their house dressing (again, highly recommended). Side dish included mashed potatoes breaded and cheesed on top, a great compliment to many of their main courses.   Finished the night with ridiculously melt-in-your-mouth are-you-kidding-me key lime pie. I should have bought a whole pie....  Truly, as good as it gets!

A trip to Pho Avina is a trip worth forgetting about. Swung by this joint for a Saturday lunch, the place was packed, with a schmeezly one server for +10 tables.   Questionable spring rolls with peanut sauce uncomfortably light brown and milky..luke warm broth in my bowl of pho (should be piping!)... and flagging down the server to order, to get water, to get a check, to get back a check was NOT cool at all.   Yes, I may be critical because of my Southern California descent, but I know it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make a decent spring roll or hire more servers when clearly needed. X-NAY!

Worth coming in here at least just for the $3.95/dozen oysters! Steal of a deal!  Albeit I came for a late Sunday dinner, I shall count the ways why this place is bomb diggity:  - SUPER warm fresh french bread roll upon being sat - Did I mention a dozen oysters for $3.95?! - A bigass piece of delicious tilapia that was still good as a leftover lunch - Cajun shrimp creole- definitely worth trying - Excellent service: helpful, informative, efficient, and not overbearing at all  Well worth a visit!

Can I just say WOW! An upscale looking and trendy restaurant without the pretentious and price of one.   I had almost lost all hope in finding a great restaurant in this side of the valley (Arrowhead), and NoRTH really swept me off my feet. The sangria is worth ordering; with the blend of raspberries, blueberries and blackberries- tastes just like juice! The warm + soft bread with their tomato dip is addicting, I couldn't stop eating it even after they brought out the roasted artichoke as our appetizer.   Our dishes were delicious- the moist salmon was cooked perfectly atop a bed of roasted squash and spinach in a light creamy sauce, while my friend's baked ziti bolognese looked just as good as it tasted. We topped off the night with the panna cotta, truly the cherry on top of a wondrous meal.   If you're looking to impress your friends without breaking the bank or wasting gas driving to Scottsdale, I highly recommend NoRTH. Word on the street is their happy hour is pretty bomb, I will be back..

Lee Lee's is a staple for homesick Asians like me who get desperate for ethnic food fix.  I am forever indebted to Lee Lee's for the fresh Vietnamese snacks and the Chinese pastries that I thought only existed in hella Asianized California, who woulda thunk?  The options are limitless here-- the produce is fresh and cheap, the aisles are fully stocked with anything and everything Asian related, and the lines are never long.   Love it!

BEST FRY'S YET  Feelin' a little blue, need a doc? No big deal, stop on by... Forgot to cash in your last paycheck? Pshh, Bank of America ATM AND bank up in this joint Crammin' for the next exam? Get your coffee fix on your way out  Food, deli, bakery, flowers, home furnishings, school supplies, I don't know where it ends...  All I need is a bed and I could live here...  Oh wait, they sell them here too.  And all this time I thought they just fixed computers and sold TVs

This review is for the 3-5p happy hour:  Ehhhhhh.....  Maybe I'm a sushi snob, but what I do know is that deep-fried does not equal sushi. There were 6 "sushi rolls" to choose from their happy hour menu, ALL of which consisted of deep-fried shiet. I don't get it? The sushi chefs are Japanese, they should be legit. The crunch roll was absolutely miniscule, the spicy tempura tuna roll and the tempura shrimp roll both had the same sugary mayo sauce squirted all over them, the green tea ice cream was covered in chocolate sauce!   Disappointed after all these great Yelp reviews. Come to the happy hour if you want to get drunk. The rolls aren't even that cheap for what you get. Meh.

As a student, sometimes you just wanna get away for an hour or so and not spend money...  Conveniently there are places like Thunderbird park that do the trick.  Located right off 59th Ave, north of the 101 is this sweet small park where you can go on that short run to get your mind off of things that piss you off, or you can long hike up to the highest top and be damn proud you did it.   Whatever your reasons are for coming out here, you'll be glad you did (just bring water... or you won't be so glad); the sights are worth it, your body'll be thankful for some exercise, and hey, why not? It's free!

Given the almost non-existent variety of pho options in the north Glendale/Phoenix area, Pholicious ranks above many (ahem Avina- vomit) to fulfill your hungover cure of beef noodle broth cravings.  The restaurant is clean, the service is fast, and the food is slightly above average, it's not as disappointing as fellow reviewers claim it to be. Noodles are nicely al dente and the broth isn't as MSG-ed out or excessively oily like other places. Prices range from $6-10, a fair price to pay for their decent sized portions. I hear their duck pho is one of the best. Me? I've had the pho tai and was well satisfied. Stick with any the noodle soups and you'll be good to go (rice dishes are a little stingy).  An extra bonus: it's conveniently located across the street from Lee Lees for all your Asian shopping needs.

Their Happy Hour $4 spicy tuna rolls are the size of my fists= HUGE. Worth going to for their happy hour alone...  Like any other restaurant in Arizona, Nakama sits in an indiscreet shopping center surrounded by your typical Kohl's and Walmart's, albeit it's right off McDowell Road so you can't miss it. Happy Hour goes from 4-7, which includes cheap drinks and did I mention some massively amazing cheap sushi rolls?  We had a feast= 2 beers X $2.50/ea, edamame $5 (huge portion, so that makes up for the slightly above avg price), 2 spicy tuna rolls $4/ea, 1 yellowtail roll $2, sashimi salad $10, chirashi $14 (sashimi salad/chirashi not on happy hour).  Service is slightly slow, so be sure to order some appetizers/booze while you're waiting. Ambiance is chill, club music pumping; don't know if it's my sushi music of choice but who can complain for the cheap rolls?  Stamp of approval!

Coming from California where fro-yo places are a dime a dozen, Juju berri is a gem in this desert!   Your standard self-serve yogurt, with an equal ratio of tart and creamy choices (kiwi/blueberry tart my personal fave), don't forget to ask and try their flavors before you begin your escapade.   Toppings are endless, don't overdo it though because you'll be surprised how much 37 cents an ounce will break your wallet.   Neon colors on the walls that gouge your eyes out are a bit too excessive for me....I'm here for fro-yo, not a rave!

Expect no com TAM-foolery here....this joint is serious about their broken rice business!   Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy, all within your $6-10 wallet budget! Service is prompt and efficient, menu is ez to follow, focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for.   I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice. Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life), the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium. All at a pansy $5.99, I could really eat this all day...everyday!

FREEEEEE: - wifi - air conditioning - comfy seats to study in - happy and excellent service  Nice and convenient, this is my go-to coffee stop when I need to get down and serious with studying. Always bubblin' with lots of different customers, you'll never feel out of company. I love that they always have a great assortment of different foods to choose from everyday, from quick hunger fixes to elaborate and delicious meals! If you're a student, make sure to show your ID for a 10% discount  Minus one star because I often seem to spend more than an arm and a leg for a drink....  Other than that, it's not a bad idea to make Next your next stop!

Okay. I'm going to admit it. I'm addicted.  Got an ad from Sumits in the mail for 2 weeks for $20, jumped on the offer like white on rice, and what a heaping bowl of fun it has been! Similar to previous posts, Sumits is a variation of Bikram- all in all you walk out of there a hot mess and feeling quite amazing.  What I like: wood floors- easy, clean, and simple; music is always different and makes yoga more fun, 90 minutes of detoxification, stretching, and truly feeling awesome. Clean showers and a nice bathroom filled with all your amenities.  What I don't like: the price is freaking expensive (upwards of $110 for unlimited monthly??). I'm a student, come on now. Also, slight inconsistency with instructors; ie, depending on the instructor you could sweat your buns off or not really sweat because they keep opening the door..  Nonetheless, I'm hooked. You got me, Sumits; like a ball and chain.  Bring your towel (I'd bring 2= one for mat and one for dripping face), cold water, and $20 for your 2 week deal. You're welcome.

I feel robbed. 42cents an ounce? Did you forget we are in a recession?  There is nothing special about 100,000th frozen yogurt joint that's popped up in north Glendale. You would think that with Yumberi, YogurtPlace, Jujiberri, they would at least try to competitively price their sub-par yogurt.   I paid over $4 for my less than half full, topping-less fro-yo and I learned my lesson. I've tasted better at Costco's food court (and paid a hell of a lost less).

Leo's opened up on Bell and 75th not too long ago and I've got to admit, I was pretty reluctant to give it a try. The closest decent Hawaiian BBQ joint can be found in Happy Valley off the 17th, which is quite a drive for students like me who go to school up the street aways.  Upon entering, you'll see a teenage boy at the register, his mom wiping down the tables, and his dad cooking in the back (all safe assumptions- they look alike). They all will gladly welcome you as if you just walked into their house for a New Year's party; it's quite adorable really.  On to the food- I got the BBQ chicken small plate while my friend got the Loco Moco, $5 + $7.50 + $2 Hawaiian drinks. Prices are decent. You pay, and they bring you the food once you sit. Takes about 5-10 min; you can see the dad make your food. Both dishes come with a scoop (or 2) of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. The chicken was cooked well; it wasn't oily and was a good amount of tender. It's fresh and filling.   I'll stop by again to give their other menu options a try. It's good to support local business and I hope this one makes it!

Damn you Scottsdale for taking all the best restaurants away from the rest of the valley!! This is yet another one of Scotty's finest: the freshest ingredients with the awesomest service.  After reading some funtastic reviews from my main man Yelp, swung by here a little after the lunch rush on fine Tuesday afternoon. Had the smoked turkey on ciabatta, rosemary steak ciabatta, with the yummus/tzaziki/olives appetizer. WARNING do not get an appetizer unless you are hungry as a hippo!! The sandwiches and wraps come with these deelicious sweet potato chipperoos, both of which will fill you up like a cactus on a rainy day.   The tab came up to ~$35, an eency bit steep for me for lunch as I probably could have had the same quality of food/service at the Jungle (of Pita, that is), but nonetheless just as excellent and well worth another visit the next time I stop by Scott's and Dale's hood!

Arcadia Farms is a lovely place to take moms and girlfriends for a super cute brunch in Phoenix's amazing January weather.  The restaurant has ample seating, both indoor and outdoor, but it might be a good idea to make reservations as it seemed pretty busy on a Friday afternoon...I can only imagine the weekends!  I had the mediterranean melt, which was an assortment of grilled veggies and melted mozzarella sandwiched in between pesto and ciabatta bread with a side of spring greens. I'm typically not a big fan of ciabatta, but in this situation, it complemented the veggies very well. My girlfriend got the chicken quesadilla, which was probably the fanciest queso I've ever seen in my life. Both were plated nicely and tasted as fresh and good as it looked.  Yes, it is on the more pricey side, as each entree ranges from $12-20 but I'd come here again considering the options for cute brunch joints are disappointingly miniscule.
