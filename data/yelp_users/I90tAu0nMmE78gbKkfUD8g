I love this place! They have jazz on Friday nights and a shelf of board games. I have come here both to study and to just relax and play some games (great way to beat the heat!). The coffee is pretty strong, which I have no complaints about! The only thing that would be nice is quiet background music. It is super quiet so you feel loud even whispering!

I will only give two stars because I have had the beer and it is very good. I met up with some friends to have drinks and dinner, but I have to say, this was the worst service ever! I wasn't in the mood for alcohol, so I had a soda, but everyone else at my table was drinking beer. We had empty drinks for over 30 minutes and had to hunt down our server for refills. When it came to the food, I ordered the Stuffed Blue Bayou Burger medium well with a side of BBQ. It came out medium rare and there was no side, but I did get a nice wilting salad. Absolutely no one came to our table to check on us, or see how the food was. Our server was friends with some people close by and continually checked on them however. I will not be coming back to this establishment, which is unfortunate because I had heard such great things.

The food was very good and staff was nice. The veggie burrito just seems to be missing something as it doesn't have much flavor to it. The salsa that comes with would be helpful to add flavor but it didn't have any. Ingredients were fresh and everyone else's food was extremely good! I will definitely be going back, just skipping the burrito.

This was my first time eating here and it was very good! I got the Paneer Tikka Masala with garlic naan and it tasted amazing. Very small establishment, but they were friendly and attentive.

Good food! They have gluten free options and non spicy for this of us who enjoy the flavor a but can't handle the spice. Staff was very friendly too.

Can I just say, thank you Yelp for finding me this restaurant! It's hard to find a good hole in the wall restaurant sometimes, because well, it's tucked away! I ordered a margarita and burrito enchilada style and it was to die for. I am very sensitive to spicy foods, so I will say the least spicy sauce was still pushing my taste buds. It was nice to have sauces full of flavor for a change and not just bland. They really know how to season food and I'll definitely be coming back!
