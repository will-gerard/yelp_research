Really nice hotel.........  Great staff, great full "FREE" breakfast, shuttle with in 5 miles and a nice big heated pool.  Looked like the hotel just got all new carpet, the place is really fresh and clean.    Just what our group needed.  This hotel is great for Sport teams.  Great places to eat right in the parking lot.  Only a few miles from a big casino

VERY BAD -  INFESTED WITH BEE'S  We camping at Canyon Lake for 4 days over July 4th weekend.  The Bee's are SOOOO bad.  Our group was stung 15 times!  We couldn't leave anything out side.  We had to eat in the camper.  It was really bad..  One person from our group was stung 3 times after taking a drink from a cup of tea.  One 9 yr old stung twice and I was stung twice...... and so on....  I feel the camp ground should be closed until this PROBLEM is taken care of.  The camp grounds are very nice and clean.  The lake was beautiful but the bee's made the trip awful....  We set up fly and bee traps and the traps were full in minutes.  We kept a fire going and it didn't help at all...   Please take care of this VERY BIG problem...   Oh and not one sign was posted with a warning saying "Camp group in INFESTED with Bee's"!  I would have liked to of had a warning...

Just ok. I got the food to go and I thought it was very over priced for what we got. Don't think I'll go back. :(

Wonderful staff....  I had to return something and needed it replaced quick because I was going to the Grand Canyon on a big weekend hike.  The store didn't have to help me.  My return was out of the 90 Return policies.  The Store Manager Marc Scott went above being helpful.  He exchanged my return and sent me on my way to hike  the Grand Canyon .  I'm very thankful.  This is how you do business people!~~~  Marc Scott you "Get it".  Thank you!

Amazing. I was looking for a nice healthy gluten-free lunch and boy did I find one. The falafel salad with hummus on the side was an amazing lunch. I am so happy I found this place. It's cute quaint and very very clean. Looks like a fun place to go for dinner with bellydancing and all kinds of entertainment. Falafel are definitely on my top fall off a list in Arizona

It's very sad to see  company turn to bad business after the loss of an owner but this one did!    I'm very unhappy with the way this company has treated me over a rent a charge.  Scottsdale Collision is not paying thier bill's so be very careful when doing business with the company.  I was just hit with a charge from Hertz along with a number of other people.  This company put me in a rent a car saying the charge was covered by them as my car was being repaired and I was charged for the rent a car one year later!  After months of phone call's to Scottsdale Auto Collision, I got the run around.  I'm now stuck paying this charge because of poor management after the owner was killed or in Jail.  The story keeps changing from the company.  So Don't hand over your CC unless you want to pay!  I was charged one year following my service!    What a nightmare this has been~!

We really enjoy this camp. Every day my son is learning more and more. If you have a child with an active mine who enjoys learning this is the right camp for them. I can't speak highly enough about this camp.

I've been going here for a few years. Always Amazing service and caring doctors. The office itself is amazing clean and very upbeat and positive. Doctors are very knowledgeable professional and experienced. I highly recommend Verve chiropractic and medical to all my friends and family! An amazing place where I can go have chiropractic work done,  have dental work done and if I need any medical treatment it's all right there. Thank you for always taking such great care of my family!    Karla Boyles

I was in and out of this office for almost one year after a car accident and a second incident shortly there after.   Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 3:30...  I can honestly tell you I never had better care in my life. The facility is beautiful and modern. All the doctors are top- top-notch.    Today I barely remember that slipped disc in my lower lumbar.  One of the things that impressed me the most during my time here,  was the time I walked in and saw this beautiful black lab who was ill. The Dr. snapped  into action and took care of this dog. I believe he had surgery that afternoon. The man who owner the dog was very elderly. It was amazing to see the doctors take care of this dog without expecting payment.  I remember one of the doctors saying it's about saving his dog.   True story!  I'm happy to call this place " my Dr's office"!

Wonderful place!!!  The prices are great and the food was amazing. We had a Greek salad that was so fresh. I know it was freshly cut made to order.  The lasagna was very good. Per my husband. The gluten free pizza was one of the best I have ever had.   $2 bottled beer for happy hour!!!!  Yes please.....  The owner and his family were absolutely the nicest people I've ever met. Very friendly and cared that we are having a great time at dinner. Anyway...  5 star and we will be back!
