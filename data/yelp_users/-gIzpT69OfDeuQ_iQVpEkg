This store is amazing! I had such amazing assistance from a worker at this location. Cheryl spent time helping me plan my new baby's entire room without being pushy. All of the staff at this location was smiling. What great customer service. Go shop here!

These people know nothing about customer service. I had to call multiple times to get someone on the phone during office hours. They would answer the phone mid conversation and continue to help the person on the phone instead of the person in front of them. If I had a choice where to go, I would never rent from here again.

I have been going to DH for over a year and their customer service is great. I have only been getting B12 shots, but I am able to drop in and have never waited longer than 15 minutes. They are great!

This place would be better if the dj played more than 30 seconds of each song. Watch the crowd dj! Sand bar-get a new dj and you will have better weekend profits!

I just left this salon after using a groupon to do a shellac mani pedi. the girl who did my nails barely said anything during the entire 2 hours I was there. She also neglected to tell me that they would charge me to take off my shellac nail polish and also for a french manicure. I didn't find out there was an extra charge until my nails were done and I was checking out. the atmosphere was unprofessional with the other coworkers in the shop. The nail tech next to us turned on the jets in the pedi chair before it was completely filled which cause water to spray all over me and my nail tech. my nails turned out okay so I will give 2 stars, but the atmosphere and withholding info about upcharging will keep me from ever returning again.  It was also extremely hard to book an appointment. It took me 3 phone calls to find a time that the tech could work with my schedule. I've had way better.

This salon is as great as they reviews say! It was very clean and they have a ton of nail polish- both regular and gel. My design looks amazing too! I would recommend this salon for sure. The only negative thing I can say is they don't have appointments available all the time. The person I came to see was recommended to me and I had to make an appointment a week and a half in advance. The good news is she was worth the wait!
