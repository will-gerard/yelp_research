The best sushi on the North side of town. It is reasonable priced and excellent service.

Stephanie (waitress) was extremely knowledgeable about the establishment and was kind enough to share the history with us. Apparently it was a burger joint that burned down. The burger joint was rebuilt as a diner. Denny's purchased it from the owner and turned it into a Denny's with a diner feel.   Stephanie did check in on us, but the food took forever to arrive.   The bathroom was not clean... Which is one of the reasons I dislike public restrooms.   Overall, Stephanie was attentive and friendly. Food was okay but what do you expect from Denny's. ;-)

I have yet to get Bandit excited about going to the groomers. He's still a work in progress. ;-) Regarding the service, no complaints there. Every time we take him in he comes out looking handsome. We like the Teddy Bear cut, so he gets it every time. I love that they keep his history on file. I can have my dad or daughters drop him off while I'm at work. The only downside is Bandit is starving when I pick him up. I wish PetSmart gave the dogs a little snack while they're visiting. Outside of that, service is wonderful and I have a happy fur son (kind of).

First time eating here. I love it. There is no way anyone can eat all of this food in one setting. I'm completely speechless. Everything I ate was delicious even the donuts that they give you at the end of the meal.   Ashlen is an excellent waitress! Extremely friendly and knows the menu well. I will definitely return, but the next time I'll make sure I have on my fat girl pants.

It is a good breakfast place. They give plenty of food and the environment is nice. What topped off the dining experience is thar the owner greets everyone and makes sure the food was good. Excellent customer service! I would come back again if I'm ever on this side of town.

The kids enjoyed it. My brother told me they have a deal on Friday - $5 per person. The staff was nice and the location was clean. They have free wireless so I was able to work while the kids played. There are two sides to this location. The side on the left has black lights. If you're out of shape you may want to think twice about climbing the bouncy slide. It is a tad bit of a workout for parents with littles. Overall good experience I would return. Oh the positive side is they have a pump it up screen to take pictures with. I love those things.

Nice location.. The machines are clean and the trainers are nice. I signed up for personal training. There is some inconsistency between the trainer that signs you up and your actual trainer. That doesn't bother me too much as I do my workout with the trainer then cardio afterwards.   My daughter is working out with me for the first time. She's not use to a personal trainer but will in due time. The trainer follows up with you during the week to make sure you're doing good. I like the personal touch.  I've been working out in the mornings and around 4:30. Doesn't appear to be too busy during those times. Return to work next week so we will see if it's a madhouse in the evening.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because the meatballs were salty. I returned it for the white fish dinner. The white fish dinner was amazing. I will definitely go back again to try the other dishes.   Thanks to my friend I am no longer a brandy virgin. For the life of me I cannot remember the name of the drink but it was a mixed drink that included brandy. I'm anxious to try the remaining speciality drinks on their menu.

I come here at least once a week as a lunch date with one of my work buddies. Always quick and the food is delicious. It is never disappointing.

First time visiting Tempe Paintball  and my girls had a blast. Considering I live in Avondale it was a lengthy drive, but well worth it. We drove out there for a charity event to support a friends football team. The owner was really nice and helpful. Couldn't ask for a better experience.

The place was a little dirty and the food wasn't as good as I thought it would be. On the positive side, the staff was nice and I believe we were greeted by the owner upon arrival. I would not go back again as the food made both of us sick.

First time here. I decided to grab something to eat since my business partner was running a little late. We had an event to attend on the opposite side of the street. The service and food was really good. I had the Baja tacos. The order had taken longer than what I would have thought since I was the only one at my table. Outside of that plenty of food for one person. The only downside is my limes were dried out and not enough salsa. Outside of that I would definitely return.

This place is amazing and always packed. Despite the fact that their always busy we're still seated and with drinks in 20 minutes or less. Love that about BJ. First time at this location as we live in Avondale. My daughter won 2nd place in her dance competition and wanted BJs as her celebratory dinner. The sitting arrangements were a tad bit uncomfortable as they sat us in the back which was a little tight, but the waiter made up for the discrepancies with his awesome service.  Food was amazing as always. Girls had pizza (the reason we came to BJs) and I had the kale and brussel sprout salad.

First time visiting Lobby's Burgers. I was invited as part of a Yelp event. After a long day, the girls and I were ready to try a new hamburger spot. My family loves hamburgers. My first impression was of a typically burger spot with a lot of custom signs. My first impression quickly changed as this place was not average. We walked up to the register the gentleman was nice and extremely friendly to me and my girls. My girls ordered. I typically ask when coming to a new place what they recommend. He said everything was good and fresh as they have a select menu. Wasn't what I wanted to hear but I made my selection. Food came and it was good. My girls devoured their burgers and fries. All they could talk about was the shake and how good it was, as they constantly asked me to try it. I had the Bacon Burger, at first it was a little salty for me. After I removed the pickle it was game over. If I'm ever on that side of town I will stop in for a burger and shake. I need to try everything else on the menu. I enjoyed the burger so much that I purchased an extra burger for my dad.

My dad recommended this location. I was in and out in less than 15 minutes. The longest stint of the appointment was providing insurance, payment, and prescription for the blood draw. I think the wait time has something to do with the time I arrived - early morning.  My dad typically goes at 7 am when the lab first opens and is home by 7:30 am. Apparently I had a tab, the guy was nice about it and I paid it. Overall friendly staff. The downside is as I was walking out there was a urine sample sitting on a cart by the lobby door. I would think that there is a special place for samples to be kept. No concerns outside of that since I didn't have to use the rest room..

I don't know what to say about this location. I've been to this location twice and every time the lady on drive thru has been rude. I guess the food is okay for fast food.

Daughters third visit and she is moving along. They are the nicest PT I've met. Everyone seems to really care about my daughters well being. Best clinic hands down and I'm glad my Facebook friend referred this place.

Nice place for a date. It is small, very few tables but the food is wonderful. I have to say it took a while for the food to come to our table but it was worth the wait. Food was a little under temperature but still good. I would go back again.

First Impression: The owner greets you at the door and welcomes you into the restaurant, which is a nice touch. The location isn't the best but that's typically where you find the best restaurants.   The food was delicious. The pancakes are yummy! I will definitely come back again.

Visited this location twice and going for my third today. I have horrible back problems and they've been wonderful throughout the experience. I am doing my best to make sure that I remain upright the rest of my life. I will continue to visit this clinic to make sure it happens. I have not tried the massage services, but I plan to soon.

I hate that I have to post a negative review.   I am giving this place two stars because we were sat immediately. Outside of that the food was less than desirable. The waitress could not get the orders correct. My daughter ended up with my brother's drink and spicy mustard on her sandwich. We had to send it back for the correct order. Needless to say we will not return.

Not impressed. I can order a better hamburger from Burger King. The fries lacked luster and the bread for the burger was stale. The burger had no flavor. Maybe the Mexican food is better than the burgers.  I may return to try the Mexican food but outside of that this place is a no/go for me.

I think this is the first time I've given any business five stars.   First let's start with my father's review since he doesn't yelp. He stated the place has a new customer. My dad wanted the bear claw to "taste" and confirm the validity of the donut shop. Well they won him over. The little apple surprise in the middle of the bear claw was the kicker for him. The donut shop reminds him of his childhood. Bravo!!!   I ordered the original donut. When I check out a new donut spot that's my signature go to item. Well it was delicious. It was better than KK and Lamar's. I even had a glazed donut which was yummy. When I want a donut this place will be the new spot. The donuts aren't pretty but taste damn good. I'll take taste over presentation any day.

First impression very busy during lunch. The lady at the cash register was able to provide a recommendation which is a plus in my book. Casual atmosphere and clean. The lady told me they've been at this location for two years. I guess I've passed it up several times. I am always over here shopping at Old Navy and Justice for my youngest.   Now for the food. It smells delicious! It is enough for two people. It was a little salty for me but everything is salty since I've been pregnant. The rice was perfect with the exception of a few hard pieces but that happens everywhere.   The lady came out to check on me. I'm now starting to think that she is the owner. I couldn't eat it all. I felt bad because I was wasting food. Nevertheless I will return. I'm interested in tasting the other items on the menu. I'm anxious to try the humus. I love a good humus.

First time eating here. It's small and intimate. We had the cheese sticks and pizza. Both were good, but the pizza was a little salty for my taste. I added some marinara from the cheese sticks which fixed the pizza right on up. I would go back if it wasn't so far out. I live on the West Side of town.

The girls and I enjoyed the burger and fries. My dad said the fries where the best as you can taste the potato instead of oil.

Big fan of QT in general. Every location I've visited is clean, the cashiers are friendly, and  machines are always working properly. I will go out of my way to get gas from QT. If I had to compare QT to another company, I would say the stores are similar to Target as Circle K is to WalMart.

Typically stop by this location after the movies or meeting with my photographers. The staff is friendly and doesn't really bother you. They have a nice long table that more than one person can sit at or (like me) for one person to take up the whole table with school work. :-( Overall the location is clean, staff is super friendly, and the artwork throughout is nice.

The lady that usually does our eyebrows moved on. We had a new lady. I had no expectations for her work outside of it's the Ulta Brow Bar so she knows how to shape brows.  Rachel was friendly to my daughter who by the way doesn't really like strangers and made us laugh while we were getting our brows done. My daughter later told me that she likes Rachel (big win for Rachel). We will definitely return.

I absolutely love this place. The food is always fresh and taste amazing. Every time I'm out this way I make an attempt to stop by. It doesn't matter if it's for dessert or dinner they have something for everyone. If I lived closer I would definitely come here to work on my dissertation. Despite the fact that it's in the heart of mill it's very quiet. I will always come back to this location.

Beautiful location. It didn't even know there were suites behind the furniture store. I love the contrast in colors (teal, gold, and white), as it gives it a lively appearance. I walked around after I left and they have a lot of services in one location. I may have to check out the facial services as this location is not far from my place of employment. Can you said spa day after work, I know that I can and I'm looking forward to it in the near future.
