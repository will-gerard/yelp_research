Had the WORST experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  Food was okay, service was awful. Had my.2 young kids with us and after dinner, we sat and waited for the waiter to being our check. We waited and we waited. Meanwhile, kids are starting to getting tired. Manager comes over to us and tells us to keep it down. We said we have been waiting for our bill.  We would like to leave.  We  tried to say that we had problems from when we got there (waited a half hour for table to be cleared and for someone to take our order). The manager WALKED AWAY, didn't even listen to us. When we left I told the manager he was very unprofessional and he td me he was going to call the cops on me. For what? Terrible place, will never go back!

The best massage I have ever had! I asked for a customized massage and Joanne talked to me first, asked all kinds of questions, and then gave me her suggestions. I had an aromatherapy massage as well as the lymphatic drainage. Amazing!!!!  She started with the lymphatic drainage that just about put me to sleep. She has a very gentle and relaxing touch. The aromatherapy massage was awesome. I then scheduled another appointment for reflexology.and a Chakra opening session, again just amazing. Joanne explained everything she did and why she was doing it. She is extremely knowledgeable in her field.  I would highly recommend her to anyone. I can't wait to get back for another massage!
