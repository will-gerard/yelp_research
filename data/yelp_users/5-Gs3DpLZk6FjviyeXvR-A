The people are friendly and the ingredients in each wrap are masterfully selected. So why only two star? They don't mix the ingredients together very well which makes for a lame meal. I want to have a bite of lettuce, cheese, chicken, and tomato. Not a bite of cheese, then a bite of lettuce, etc.

I love the sandwiches at this place. They have the best ingredients and so many options. The sandwiches do make quite a mess but it's because they are jam packed with goodness; the bread can't contain all the condiments they stuff in there.   It does have horrible art on the walls and gets really crowded at lunch, but I've sat outside and had pleasant meals (usually I just take it home).   If you like BLT's with avocado you MUST try the Jazz it is delightful!

This is the best fish and chips in the valley, hands down. Don't risk the stomach ache of going to Pete's Fish n Chips; come to Knock Kneed and you most definitly will be more than satisfied.

Grade A shopping experience if you enjoy the thrill of a hunt but are looking for nicer furniture than a Goodwill has to offer. This locations the best because it's the largest!

If you like little joints where the owner will remember your order this place is great! It's the type of place you need to experience a few times before you know what to expect. The hours change now and again so you always have to keep up with the schedule. If you go between 11 and 12:30 you will be waiting quite awhile for your food and checking out can be confusing or have a bit of a wait time. Not to fear, I take my hour lunch at Lowdown often and have never been late coming back. The food is phenomenal. I am not much of a wrap person but I have never had a bad wrap from this place. I recommend the rosemary chicken. Rebecca J's review mentions the relaxed atmosphere. While she finds some of the relaxed behavior odd, I think it is quaint and charming.

George was super nice and easy to work with. He did a great job removing large stains from our carpet in a short amount of time. The price seemed like a great deal and was dropped lower when I told him I found him on yelp. I definitly will be calling Paradise Cleanning again.

I am a hot dog lover.   For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet. Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes, the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere. I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite.

I had a bad experience with Camelback Cleaners. I brought in a blanket and my sofa cover, I didn't get them back for three weeks.  When I dropped them off I was told to return in a week. When I did they told me they would need another week. Why they hadn't called to tell me this is beyond me. So I came back the next week and they told me the dry cleaners, they do not do the dry cleaning themselves, had misplaced my sofa cover but not to worry because they'd probably find it soon.  After another week they called and said they'd found it and I could pick it up. In the end it'd taken three weeks to get a clean sofa cover and a blanket that reeked of chemicals. It was upsetting.

Girls night was cranked up a notch when we headed to The Shop! The tiny bar that is connected to Hidden House, a great dive bar, could not offer a better place to dance.  If you want to hear a great mix of less commercial hip hop and old school in a small intimate setting The Shop is for you.

I took my first yoga course at Second Heart Yoga. It was wonderful! Nan was very sweet and helpful. The environment is very relaxing and I felt comfortable trying something new in the company of such warm people.  I've also enjoyed the Sunday morning Yoga for charity. Nan led a class outside. Enjoying the nature and the relaxed flow of the course was a wonderful feeling.
