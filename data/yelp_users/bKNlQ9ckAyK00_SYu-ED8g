We went there for valentine's day and couldn't make reservations.  We waited for an hr till we got seated, but boy was it worth the wait. The food was excellent,  great big portions of lobster. Great staff. I would definitely eat there again.

*MAY GET FOOD POISONING if you eat here  I ordered from there lunch menu and got hot and sour soup, fried wontons , and orange chicken. First off the hot and sour soup looked and tasted like egg drop soup...only had two spoon fulls of that. The fried wontons were good. The orange chicken was awful, way too much sauce and tasted dry and soggy. TO TOP IT ALL OFF I GOT FOOD POISONING :-( do not eat here unless you want to risk getting sick. Made me scared of Chinese food for a while....and I'm Chinese lol now I only order Singapore rice noodles,  and that is a hard dish to find.

This place wasn't very good. .. I ordered the smokey jack panini  and it wasn't a panini. It was old, dry bread with old tomatoes. I couldn't even finish it. Paninis are hot and flattened,  but this one was cold and looked like a sub. Would not recommend at all. It looked like it was a 3 day old sandwich.

I love going to place, especially during happy hour.  My favorite rolls to get are the dragon roll, tempura shrimp roll, sweet potato roll and the calamari roll.  If Im craving sushi, this is my go to place.  I mainly come here for the sushi rolls and the edamames during happy hour :) The service is always great! oh and cannot forget the desserts, very tasty!

Great atmosphere and wonderful Service!! The food was amazing and wings were so yummy. I honestly prefer there wings over bww or wingstop. The pilgram is my favorite, if you love thanksgiving food then that's the one to get. Oh yeah and Cornish pasty is a pokemon stop.

Great place to eat.  Not expensive at all and the food quality is great :)  This is where my boyfriend and I go all the time if we are craving Thai food.  Their pad thai is just the best too.  Lovely staff and great service.  If you are craving thai, this is definitely the place to go!

This place is okay, I have gone a couple of times, but the last time I went the food was horrible and the service was really bad.  They were not even that busy.  If I had to choose between thai basil and thai rama which is just around the corner I would travel a little further and go to thai rama.  I live right behind thai basil and I wont eat there.  the price for the food is not worth it.

Great place to take your pup and just explore. Lots of room to run around and relax. Nice view of the lake and great events happening at the park.

Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! Little pricey but what do you expect,  right by the stadium.  The mozzarella sticks were amazing, spring roll full of mozzarella cheese. Food was absolutely amazing...and for a busy day on game day, service was on on point. Will be returning.  Go dbacks!

Waited to order my food at drive through once someone eventually answered I waited to pay. The employees were just playing around and not paying any attention.  So I went to the next window, thinking that other window might have been closed. I was wrong. Boyfriend started getting passed off for waiting so long that we just left without paying or getting food. The employees were just laughing and running around not attending to the customers..... Horrible service... It's sad too because I liked there food.

I have never had a pierogi or stuffed cabbage until now. They taste amazing and for such a good price. I could eat the stuffed cabbages all day long.  The guys are so nice too. Highly recommend.
