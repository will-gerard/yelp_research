I would give them a zero if possible, they put us on hold  for ten minutes, then wouldn't answer their phones again after we called back. We called 45 mins before the store closed, so if these pathetic burn outs, who don't deserve minimum wage because they clearly don't even do their jobs, aren't going to keep the store open for the times noted on here, then they need to update their hours. I will be contacting the manager of this establishment tomorrow as well as the district manager.

This place is pretty sweet! Cool vintage shop up front and cool salon in the back. Ashley did a great job on my hair!
