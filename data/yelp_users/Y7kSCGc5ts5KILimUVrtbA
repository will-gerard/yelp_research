I was recently introduced to the art of Bonsai from my brother in law.  I have been researching how to Bonsai small plants and train them but most everything I have seen says I need a special mix of soil. I have my own compost and sand but needed pumice and gravel. Most garden places I have looked at either have huge bags or no clue what I'm looking for. I looked online and found a Bonsai club that listed baker nursery as having Bonsai supplies. When we got there we loved how large the nursery was. They had a very large selection of plants and almost every kind of garden decoration you can think of. We kept looking through all the plants & thinking where we can put each one in our yard & garden. They had almost anything you can think of & a few things i had never seen before. It is rose season & the selection & colors of roses made me wish i had won the lotto so i could drop it all on flowers!  I had heard though that they had a collection of Bonsai on display in the nursery & when we found it I was amazed! They were georgeous! It is truley amazing that something that small can look so majestic! We did end up finding a small bag of pebbles & a small bag of Pumice which was exctly what we needed. We even bought a decoration for my new Bonsai. And of course my husband could not resist some plants either, so we got a few small things for him to put around the yard. When we had a good look around & were checking out we asked if there was anyone there that really knew a lot about Bonsai plants & care so we can ask a few questions. They told us they would page Charlie over for us. Let me tell you Charlie was great to talk to. I was a little shy at first because I am not starting with a traditional plant, but am trying to Bonsai a Gardenia, but Charlie told me it was great that I was trying it out on something so pretty. He walked us around & even showed us a few plants that he is personally working on. He assured us that what we were planning on doing was right on track and the nutrients we had to feed the plants with would be great! I ended up buying even more Bonsai stuff from them after we talked. I will definately be back to this gem of a nursery. It was worth the drive!

I am an Arizona transplant from Southern California. I have VERY thick & curly hair, and it is hard for me to find someone who can work with my hair & do a great job. So when we moved out here I had no clue who to go to. I tried one place & i asked them if they knew how to cut my kind of hair. Of course they said yes, but they completely chopped it. I ended up going back to Cali to visit my family & had my old stylist fix it. I then waited almost a year before i let someone touch my hair again. Then someone at my office told me about this great salon down the street from us & told me to ask for Tawnie. i was very scared of another botched haircut, but she listened to what i wanted & i came out with the best haircut i have had i a very long time. Tawnie washes & cuts my hair & then straitens it to make sure it is all even & then textures it for me. We even thin it every few times (something that i have run away from in the past b/c if done wrong will make my hair fro out like a bad clown wig) and it always turns out great. The fact that she blows it dry & styles it is great b/c i have a lot of hair & it takes a while to dry. She always shows me the best new products for my hair so I can easily style it at home too, which is no small feat, I have been going here for 4 years now & i will keep coming back as long as i still live here. Thank you Tawnie for taking great care of my hair for me!

Dim sum is a great experience. The staff passes by with their steam carts & shows you a variety of items (steamed or fried) and each order is 3-4 pieces. If it looks good try it! You might be surprised. The best thing is the prices are very reasonable. They keep your ticket at your table & mark it off as you go so you always know how much food you are buying. Staff is very friendly, though sometimes a little hard to understand - but hey its authentic! If you want something you don't see just ask & they will make sure it comes over to you. I highly recommend the fried noodles with bean sprouts & onions. Also the steamed buns filled with BBQ pork are a must! They are sweet & savory & delicious. For desert we try to get the bread filled with a coconut paste & you have to try the sesame balls! The balls are filled with red bean paste which sounds scary but is sweet and yummy, then they are rolled in white & black sesame seeds & fried to a crispy finish. The texture is amazing, fried & crispy on the outside of a gummy but soft ball & then the warm almost gooey filling in the middle. They come with 3 on a plate so if you are like me & always go with someone else you may have to fight over the extra one. I will recommend this place to anyone. My husband & I cant wait to try them for dinner one night to try their regular menu.

Staff was very friendly. They walked us through the menu and let us sample a few items before ordering. Order came out with Cuban black beans instead of the refried beans we ordered. They were ok but did not like the sweetness of them. Food was ok. Not bad. But not amazing either. The green sauce on the emerald chicken was good on its own but overpowered everything else on the plate. All I could taste and smell was the ginger. And I love ginger. The concept of ordering everything individually for a combo is nice, but once everything is piled on top of itself it is overwhelming. The snickerdoodle at the end was yummy though. It was worth a try but not sure I will be back.

I woke up late one morning & did not have a chance to eat breakfast so my husband swung by my office & gave me a scone to eat. It was the best scone I have ever had, so I asked him where he got it & he told me it was from this little coffee house called Steve's. I had to go and check it out myself. I got there right after they opened (about 5:30 in the morning) so they were not really busy yet, but the guys behind the counter both greeted me & one took my coffee order and the other grabbed me a scone.  The service was really fast & I was in and out in 2 minutes, which was GREAT because I needed to hurry up and get to work. Once I was at work I was able to sit down & enjoy what I ordered. I got the French Roast which was nice & bold as advertised. They use a French Press to brew all their coffee which usually means a 5+ minute wait at any other coffee house (not to mention you have to specifically request it at other places), but because this is their standard method they already had it ready to go. But the coffee was not even the best part. They had 2 different kinds of scones today; Chocolate Chip or Cranberry Orange. So I picked the Cranberry one & it was delish! Their scones are flaky but still moist & perfect. The tart cranberries were just what I wanted in the morning with the sweetness of the scone itself & the strong cup of coffee. The sign up front also said that they make all their treats from scratch! Great little place to stop in the morning. This was the perfect start to my Friday! I will definitely be back.

My yelp friends at work have talked about this place a few times & i keep thinking we need to try it out. My husband woke up this morning & said he wanted to make Blueberry cream cheese crepes. I told him there was this place i wanted to try that made crepes & we should go there instead, and it is worth it to me to go out so I don't have to clean up a huge mess. So we took our dogs and had a great Sunday breakfast. They have a few patio tables outside & the Arizona weather is perfect right now to eat outside! The staff was great & they kept checking to make sure we had everything we needed which is great b/c sometimes when you are outside it can be easy to be ignored. I ordered a vanilla latte & my husband had a plain coffee. My latte was perfect, just sweet enough for me. My husband saw that they did indeed have blueberry cream cheese crepes & ordered one. I went a little more savory and ordered the turkey, avocado & pesto crepe. They were both fantastic. Pesto can be very oily, but this was perfect and really brought everything together in a perfect bite. The blueberry crepes were great too, but I'm glad i didn't have that to myself as it was very sweet & rich. My husband has a huge sweet tooth though & he is a sucker for blueberries so he was in heaven. The staff even brought a bowl of water out for our dogs. Great little spot to meet up for a cup of coffee & a light breakfast! Will definately be back.

Udder Delights was at a Yelp Community event with their truck serving up their cupcakes and Ice Cream. The other company that was serving dinner wasn't ready yet so my friend & I decided to go for dessert first.  It was a great decision! We each had a red velvet cupcake that looked as beautiful as it tasted. Usually Red Velvet for me is a little too much on the rich side because they load up that cream cheese frosting, but this cupcake was a perfect combination of cake to icing.  The guys at the cart were wonderful to talk to as well. They were very funny & made sure we knew what community events they are at on a regular basis. They also invited everyone down to their dairy farm for a tour & some ice cream in their shop. We will definitely go check them out. After we had the cupcake I went back and bought 2 more to take home to the hubby, one more Red Velvet & the other was a chocolate with a coffee toffee topping. After our Yelp event was over the guys from Udder Delights invited us back to their truck if we wanted to take home any of their home made ice cream. I took a scoop a vanilla & a scoop of their Red Velvet as well to take home with my cupcakes.  They said their ice cream is made from scratch with 6 ingredients. It tasted great! When I did get home my husband grudgingly shared the ice cream & cupcakes with me. I liked the Red Velvet more than the Chocolate cupcake, but both were good. I love homemade vanilla ice cream & this stuff reminded me of making it with my Great-Grandma when I was a kid. The Red Velvet Ice Cream was ok, nothing screamed out Red Velvet to me about it though, it was more like plain chocolate.  I will definitely go check them out around town though & see what else they have to try.

Wanted to try a new place for lunch today, but didn't want to pay too much. A friend told me about this place & so I had to check it out.  The girl behind the counter was very friendly and helpful when we placed our orders. I had the Famous gyro plate in the lunch portion. We had to wait about 15 minutes for the food to come, but it was worth it.  There was a big pile of gyro meat with the yogurt sauce and pita in the side so it was like a build your our gyro. I didn't know it didn't come with onions, but it was still great! It did come with 2 sides & i picked the lemon potatoes & stemed veggies. The veggies were great. Perfectly cooked with just a little crunch left & seasoned very well! The potatoes tasted great, but were over cooked & a little soggy. But the Gyro was perfect. They have great pita bread here. I even ordered a side of garlic hummus & extra pita to take home for later. I took a tiny bite & it is pretty yummy! The lunch plate was only $5 which makes it a great place to stop in. I had more than enough food & the price was right to have me keeping this little place in mind when I go out to lunch to grab a bite. I can't wait to come back & try more of their menu out!

My friends at work have tried this place a few times & keep telling me about it went with them this last time. We were able to sit right down, but must have had perfect timing because it filled up pretty fast. Its a little small, but has a great atmosphere & I love all the decorations and details. The lunch menu has a pretty nice variety. And you can ask them to alter the spice level for you if you do not like it hot.  I had the Massaman Curry (so did my other 2 friends that have been here before) but we all ordered it with different levels of heat. I went with hot (not Thai hot - i wasn't sure how crazy that was yet & trust me - hot was HOT, but in a good way) It came with a choice of salad or soup & I went with the Hot & Sour soup. It was delish. It was just enough to make me want more, but not enough to fill me up and ruin my lunch. Then the curry came out and i was in Heaven! It smelled amazing, and that creamy coconut spicy broth was to die for! I even added some extra chili to it & boy it was kickin'! It was the kind of hot that comes up on you and makes you want to eat some more. The little crispy spring role that came with it was perfectly cooked & it was a nice break from the rich curry sauce. I was even able to save a little bit to take home to the husband so I can tempt him to come here with me in the future.  I will definitely be back to work my way through this Tasty menu.

Had some problem with white fly and root aphids but these guys pointed me in the right direction. From start to finish these guys have helped us with all our garden questions.
