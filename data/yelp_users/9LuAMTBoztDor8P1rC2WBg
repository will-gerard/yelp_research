Do you come here often? This old line would definitely work here. Great for families or old marrieds looking to get out of the house and laugh-out-loud for a few hours. This place is a brightly colored, entertainingly, loud, home away from home, covered in unexpected but, laughtasticly humorous saying that creatively remind you of where you are.  I have been here a few times in the past, with friends, unsually during the day (Day drinking, as their shirts say). So, the other Saturday night I decided to head over after some strenuous solo christmas shopping. Looking to relax, refuel, drink, flirt and..... (nevermind, it didn't happen anyways). I parked near the Greenfield side and walked up to what I thought was the main door. But, it was locked! The thought crossed my mind that they may be closed? But, the loud music led me around the corner to the chill-friendly security door check who informed me that they serve food until 2am and wished me a good time. As I made my way inside the place was pretty busy on the patio, with a live DJ, no seats left at the bar, and absolutley no one but staff on the inside, I guess that was their intention.  I found a nice spot (with great viewing) on a corner table in the patio area, far too big for just myself, but who knows, the night was still young... Within seconds, my server was at my table taking my drink order and right back to take my food order (Ugh, I MUST have looked famished! Or he's just that good?) He was back over in a few minutes with my chips and salsa and appologized that the food would be taking longer than normal. I thanked him and told him it was no problem, as I was in no hurry.   As I waited I finally had a chance to really look around. I have to admit, I was quite surprised to see so many regular farmer, construction types had filled the place with their jealous polential wife types (just the feeling I got). It reminded me of my visits to the NW! I guess I'll have to make an appearance at this place more often! I felt like the best looking thing to happen to this place in awhile and I was totally cas in jeans and sneakers! It was a little surreal! Although the stinky eye lady glances in my general direction were getting a bit annoying (...remember, corner table seat.) I wanted to say: Ladies, PUHLEASE, I am NOT looking at your man! ...I am simply trying to lip read Joe Rogan's mouth for the details of the UFC fight. (the other best looking thing in the place, besides me. Yeah, it was one of THOSE nights) Sheesh! But, they would have never heard me over the DJ beats and the cornhole game happening in the walk way.   Just then, my food arrived. Luckily, I had asked them to make it to go. I had read the handy yelp reviews on this Supergooeycheese chimi thingy and Man! This thing did not dissappoint! I dug right into it! Fully loaded and super flavorful! It has this amazing smelling/ tasting jalapeno cream sauce and ?lbs of cheese I asked the servicer, but I forgot (lost in the deliciousness) he smiled as he explained, knowing exactly what I was experiencing. It actually got better with every overloaded mouth full! Quarterway through I paused just long enough to realize I was already stuffed! But, by that time I was pretty much done with the discomfort of the corner seat with a 'greeat' view.  Overall, a great place to take the fam to get out of the house for a nightlife atmosphere with generous sized portions of food and not have to dirty your own kitchen. Buuut, not the best place to go for a 'meeting' or a friendly conversation with strangers.

Ah, Dolce Borgata! I have found this to be my FAVORITE Salon & Spa so far! A beautiful little sanctuary nestled in the back area of the Borgata shops. *Plus, this location requires it's employees to be 100% smoke free! So, you don't get the after smell and mess. I went in with one spa week -organic facial- discount and I was hooked! *Just make sure you schedule your free make up touch up (when available) at the same time you are booking your services.  The entry area is super lux and super chic. The front desk women are always very professional, quick to greet me and get me signed in. A very helpful and friendly staff, they always offer to bring a drink over as I sit down on the comfy lounge furniture within view of the extensive jewlery and hair accessories area. On the other side is a clothing section and a vast array of lotions and other fabulous skin care products.   I have only tried their facials at this point. But, let me tell you, it makes my soul happy and ULTRA relaxed (HIGHLY recommended after a long work week). As soon as you are led into this dimly lit hallway a blanket of heart slowing percussion sounds envelope you into a sweet lullaby.  I love Hadley's techniques she is delicate and very knowledgable about the skin concerns you may have. She gently explains what options may work best for your needs and never makes you feel uncomfortable but, you feel more at home. A warning though- it is easy to fall asleep in this environment and totally forget you might actually be laid out on a table in only a velcro towel!   After the services she gives plenty of time to (reluctantly) gather yourself and meet her in the hallway where you have the chance to see, touch and ask any questions about the produces that have been recommended for you. Before checking out (or shopping, hehe).  After these services I have recieved personalized thank you cards in my mail box with even more discounts and offers! I absolutely love this location!! This is a great place to escape the worries of the world and get pampered, personalized, special treatments. I always walk away feeling like it was money well spent and TOTALLY relaxed and refreshed!!

I love, LOve, LOVE this place! It reminds me of the old Barcelona and has become my home away from home. Dimly lit and all sexy. This is the place to see and be seen. With numerous themes and give aways nightly. A friendly mature crowd inhibits this space, so your sexy dress up clothes are encouraged. PLUS, I have yet to witness or be groped by the disgusting rump humpers. (you know what I'm talking about, ladies...) But instead, have had many a good conversations and made some very good friends here. (Maybe they are catching on to my celebrity status as a regular.. I mean Valuable VIP?? ...Nahh! Hehe)  Parking can be a challenge and the door can cause a delay, so plan for it. But, once inside makes for a super cozy almost Miami cabana feel. Imagine complete strangers brushing up against eachother 'accidently' in passing and lovers nuzzled up close, lost in conversation and laughter surrounding this large, open, and well ventilated covered patio area containing the massive granite top bar with flat screens dotted along the walls. Inside, are two equally large bars, where live bands take to the stage and perform. The only downer is that the dance floor is on the smaller side and gets very packed! But, if shake it space is limited, there are also pole tables to get up on!  TIP: To create your own space and get pampered, reserve a table in the VIP section, you will not be disappointed!  The waitress and bar staff probably model in their spare time, because they're GAUWGOUS!! I love the uniforms! But, their service is superior and the drinks are STRONG! They have never let me down, as I have tried almost all of the martinis and mixed drinks, everything has it's own personal finish; edible orchids; apple slices; graham cracker crust rim; gummy bears; glow sticks whatever you want they have it! PLUS, the shaker on the side of your martini will keep the contents cold longer on those hot Arizona nights (they will even make you an alcoholic 'looking' (although, non-alcholic) drink for a fraction of the price!   HH is the best time to get in and try their specialty drinks and food. The Margherita and Beef Tenderloin & Portabella flatbreads are a great choice and I am in love with their Fruit and Cheese Plate it's huge and could easily be shared at least 4 ways!  Thank you Blue Martini for coming into our lives. Keep up the good work I am totally a fan!

Hurry in and try this Ginger Cinnamon Latte!! I added carmel sauce and soy milk over ice in their large, a whopping 32oz size, Delish!! The flavor combination was amazing! I would drive out of my way any day for this place.   Tucked behind Fox and Hound Pub & Grill this coffee shop is small, but warm and inviting. The staff was very helpful and friendly, my barista even asked me to try this unusual concoction, upon pickup, to make sure I liked it. I was in love! I may have found my new coffee stop.   Comparable to *bucks pricing but has a much truer taste without the burnt espresso taste = worth it! They also have a convenient drive up window. (Yay! now I can pickup this coffee goodness in my pjs!)

I couldn't wait to check out this place since the change from Salty Senorita's. Although, I must admit that I was a little apprehensive since the outside (street side) does give a kind of rough and tough biker type of feel... But, the parking lot side shows the nice, new, open, game room (or man cave) type of feel this place creates.  I was surprised by the space and seating of the patio bar area! It is much bigger than when this was Salty's. The brisk night air felt good on arrival, and the heaters came on in all the right places when it started to cool down for the evening. They did a great job with the remodel, creating lots more room to mingle and chat with friends... There are also tons of flat screen tvs, set at different angles for optimum viewing.   On this saturday night, the DJ was able to light up the dance floor and get people dancing to a fixture of hip-hop and cool beats. Everyone seemed to be having a good time dancing and singing along to each song. The waitresses were busy but efficient and always pleasant and friendly.  I found the long islands to be very good, and couldn't taste too much alcohol, which was nice until... it snuck up on me later! Lol! But, it was the mozzarella sticks that my waitress recommended that will keep me coming back. They were awesome! wrapped in wonton wrappers and a larger size stick than I have seen anywhere else. These were good in the marinara sauce but even better with the ranch side sauce, a combination I have never tried before, but I loved it! A great appeitizer to share, 5 sticks for only $7!  Overall, I gave it 4 stars because I am a big fan of this cool comfortable spot with a little bit of something for everyone, especially the sports enthusiasts. Good apps. But, no drink menus? (which would be a nice addition, as I assume they serve a good amount of drinks per night) It just needs more people to visit!!
