Oh my gosh these fajitas are to die for.   The tortillas are hand made, hot and fresh.  I love the veggie fajitas -- they come heaped on a sizzling pan - peppers, onions, black olives, all caramelized and topped with seasoned grilled zucchini. The onions and peppers are WAY better even than the ones you get with the meat veggies, so everyone always steals mine. But there's plenty! Tell them you're vegan and they sub guacamole for the cheese and sour cream on the condiment dish, free of charge. I love this place!

We were very pleasantly surprised by this little place. Scrupulously clean, very pleasant and attentive staff, and delicious food. The portions are more than generous and there are LOTS of vegan options. My husband had the BBQ chicken ANC loved it. It came with a dish of spicy sauce that he said was great. I had veggies and tofu and it was really tasty. You can specify the degree of heat you'd like in the many dishes that include peppers. We will definitely be coming back. Yum!

We have been to Bravi several times now, but now that it is summer and it's hot outside, they moved the band inside. Music is SO loud you have to yell across the table to speak to each other. Up til last night we had no problems (except that I'm vegan and twice they forgot I said no feta. I don't send stuff back, ever...so I just picked it off and gave it to my husband.) Anyway, last night we brought friends with us, not knowing about the music. My friend ordered the eggplant parmesan and didn't like it at all. I warned her that the menu said it was roasted, but she got it anyway. She said the breading was very thick, almost burnt, and could not be cut without using a knife. The eggplant itself was mushy. However, her husband loved it, so go figure. Anyway, I had the Mediterranean pasta and it was great. (and they remembered to leave the cheese off!) Both the guys got calzones, which are huge. They both seemed to enjoy their dinner very much. But I sure won't go back until the band is back outside. The wait staff is excellent -- very attentive, but not TOO much so. The place is clean and nice. It was just embarrassing to have our friend get a meal she couldn't eat, plus having to yell at each other.

Best hummus ever! We love the jalape√±o hummus, and they'll give you cucumber slices for dipping instead of pita if you want.  I love their falafel, too.  The Lentil Fetoosh (spelling?) is really good, too.  Lots of vegan options. My husband and grandkids love the lavosh pizzas and the pita wraps. The staff is great, and the food is delicious. We bring friends here all the time and they always end up coming back.

I love this place -- we eat here about once a week.  I'm not a huge fan of fake meat, so I stick mainly to the tofu dishes, but I love the Rainbow Salad, the Veggie Tofu Delight, the spring rolls, the curry soups, and the Kung Pao. In fact, the only thing I ever had here that I wasn't wild about was the eggplant dish. My husband isn't even vegan and he loves it here, too. The place is clean, the staff is awesome, and the food rocks.

This is the cleanest gym I have ever been in. The staff are all friendly, things get put away, and there are plenty of machines and weights so you can get an excellent workout. The stretching area is a bit small and they don't have a complete set of smaller barbells or easy bars, but you can work around that. No frills-- just a nice, bright, clean gym. We've belonged to four different gyms now (they keep getting sold and/or closing), and we are really happy at YouFit. The price is right too!
