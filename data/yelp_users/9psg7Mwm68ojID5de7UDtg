My fiance, my sister and me went here for an early dinner on a Friday night in February.  We'd heard great things and were eager to try it.  Even though the place was practically empty, we had the WORST, most inattentive server I've ever had.  She spent most of her time chatting with the bartender.  Our drinks took forever, our hummus (while very good) took forever and the fact that we were so ignored that we never even got silverware, made the dinner unbearable.    We were able to get one round of drinks and a hummus and antipasto platter before we decided we couldn't take it anymore and asked for the check.  To top it all off, I sent an email to the address on their website about the poor service and experience we had, and no one emailed me back. No one called me about it to apologize.  I will NEVER return here. Spend your money somewhere where they actually care about their customers.

Great laid-back place.  Music is pretty loud. Taps are great and ever-changing.  Awesome people watching. Excited to go back and try the pizza and pretzels.

Had a couple lattes here and breakfast one morning.  Breakfast burrito was one of the best I've had and the fruit and yogurt parfait was wonderful!  Comfy seating and friendly, local atmosphere.  Definitely recommend if you find yourself in Cave Creek.

Great employees!  Cant beat the $0.50 cup of coffee.  Come here for breakfast often and I can't help but order the fruit parfait each time!  it's delicious!  Have also had the breakfast burrito which is wonderful as well.  The hot/cold sandwiches are good too as well as the pastries.

I've been here three times.  I keep trying to be satisfied, but I always seem to be disappointed.  Maybe in the winter when it's cool enough for the patio, I can bring my dog and it might be redeemed a bit. Food is average. Omelets are thin and meh.  Biscuits and gravy are good. Coffee is fine.  Service is sketchy.  I've had great and I've had horrible.

Everything was great! Everything was well seasoned and delicious. A little more expensive than your average Greek place, but the norm for Greek is a 'hole in the wall'.  The great service and atmosphere compensate for the price though.   Highly Recommend!

Great, friendly service (always same two ladies).  Fast and fresh sushi. Prices are pretty decent.  I always leave happy.

I feel like the other reviews are a bit unfair so far.  Especially as it seems most of them went during the first 2 weeks the place was open (usually not a good time to judge the quality of a new restaurant).  Personally, with the limited selection of tap beers in the town, this place is a gift.  Tons of micro brews and local suds - some that I haven't even heard of.  Like piano music playing classic hits was nice- not crazy loud.  Service was just fine - very friendly.  We ordered a salad with chicken (way too much stuff in the salad) and the fried mushrooms (surprisingly delicious).  Overall, suggest if you are looking for a place with a wide selection of craft/local brews on tap, this place doesn't disappoint.

Sue was wonderful to work with for our wedding cake.  We were so happy we found her - she was so professional and easy to work with!  We knew right away we would have no worries about our cake.  Her ideas and suggestions were really helpful and the cake turned out fantastic!
