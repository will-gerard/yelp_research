This place left us underwhelmed and disappointed. We were very excited to see this place packed!! But once we got our food after about a 20 minute wait, we couldn't see why this place was so busy.  We got the cheese burger special (that doesn't come with fries) and an Italian beef. The burger was burnt!! And the beef left much to be desired, it was dry and was unlike a Portillos-type Italian beef flavor that we are used to being from Chicago. The beef didn't have a good flavor and was dry despite being "dipped." What a waste of money. Do yourself a favor and go to Portillos or lukes of Chicago and skip Joeys!

DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! Over priced they charged me much more than stated on the "price sheet" what a joke! My sister who is 10 and I got manis and pedis for her birthday. On the Price sheet it says....  "mani and pedi special" : $30  "gel coating": $5 "Children's mani and pedi (11 years old and under)": $25  When I said I wanted a gel coat on my fingers they said it will be $25 dollars when it clearly states on the price sheet $5 dollars extra for gel. The "mani and pedi special" with the gel coat according to the "price list" should have been $35 dollars for me and $30 dollars for my sisters.  Total SHOULD have been $65 dollars according to the price sheet  Bottom line $86 dollars was charged   We will not be back

The service is fantastic, friendly, and fast. I   ordered takeout and they gave me complimentary water, and wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce. My order was correct, and was given to me promptly. I got the chicken fried rice, and crab puffs they were good, I recommend this place.

This place is awesome and was PACKED!!!Fast service and the BEST breakfast sandwich of my life! This place is a winner!My only complaint is that the breakfast sandwich was a little wimpy (small portions) but you can add an extra egg to your sandwich to give it more substance. That and there wasn't anywhere clean to eat. Those are my only complaints other than that this place is great!

This place is the best breakfast in town! The place was packed. I had the French toast, scrambled eggs, and bacon breakfast. Everything was fabulous. The only downside to this place is that it is noisy and somewhat disorganized.  They need a hostess and a bigger location.
