Best Italian food in the Valley and it's convenient! We call in our order and pick up our food. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but that goes to show how delicious their food is! Another plus they have is their pizza dough! Holy moly it's so good! We do pizza date night with friends and stop there to pick up the dough and some toppings beforehand. You definitely have to try this place!

Booked transportation for two busses MONTHS AGO for my wedding and now they are overbooked and can only provide one 14 person van. This is ridiculous.

Best transportation service I've ever used! Reliable and trusting drivers are what you can expect from AZ Elite. My fiancé was extremely impressed having such classy transportation for his birthday weekend at an extremely affordable rate. Not only did the drivers make us feel like high status, but they also made us young ladies feel safe while taking each one of us home! I would never take a cab ride home alone, but AZ Elite has completely changed this perspective! I only trust AZ Elite Transportation!!!
