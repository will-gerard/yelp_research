Wow!!! Aaron and Francesco are extraordinary mixologists!!! Not only do they make great cocktails, but the hospitality and customer service is above and beyond!!!! They make your visit ridiculously amazing!!! I will be returning, most likely, at least once a week!! The vibe and atmosphere is just mind blowing. They keep it clean and sophisticated.  Never wait long for my drink order to appear in front of me. I was also waited on a young lady named Lexi. She was adorable and timely. Always a smile on her face! The service there is impeccable!! I was beyond impressed!! If you're ever looking for a great spot.. Sexy atmosphere, great cocktails, and unbelievable hospitality and service... Merc Bar is the place to be!!!!

I'm a new member and have been taking advantage of a lot the Village has to offer. I used to work at Canyon Ranch in Tucson, and the amenities are quite similar. And an 1/8 of the cost. What really blew me away was a new trainer there named Rachel Miller. I was offered a small, but free to new members, group personal training class. She is a new employee there and her skills, knowledge, communication, and motivation was on point!! I'm super spoiled coming from canyon ranch and really hoping all the trainers and instructors are as impressive as her. My body was sore everywhere for next 3 days. She knows her stuff. I would wake up at the crack of dawn to do boot camp, bosu core, whatever if she's instructing. Instructors are key to enjoying your workout classes. I hope she on the schedule ASAP. Employees are super friendly, but nobody "wowed" me like Rachel!! So glad she's a part of the team. Looking forward to continuing my fitness and relaxation at Camelback Village.

This place is awful!!!!! I've been going to Firestone for yrs all over Arizona. Never ever had an issue until this location!!! Messed up my appts 3 times in one week. I've been here a total of 4 times this week!! Refused to top off all my fluids. Never heard of this before. It's your job!!!! When asking for my keys back, he refused. Then I asked the guys in the garage to give them to me and the GM told me "to stop being crazy!" Excuse me!?! No. Never coming back here again!!! They will screw up everything!!

Shay was unbelievable!! Absolutely made my shopping experience one of the greatest!!!! Her clientele/customer rapport was phenomenal!! She deserves a raise!! She goes above and beyond to make your experience spectacular!! Not only did I find some awesome selections, I felt comfortable asking her opinion on certain sizes and fit. I will definitely be back sooner than later, specifically for the experience I had the last trip into Victoria's Secret. Thanks Shay!!! Marilyn also helped me pick out some super sexy pieces and sized me for the perfect fit! Thanks Marilyn! You ladies Rock!

Ok whoa!!! I just had the most life changing massage. I'm blown away. As someone who's lived a pretty fit life, as well as worked at one of the top three health and wellness facilities in the world(Canyon Ranch), and have had many therapeutic massages.... WOW!! Did I mention life changing!?! RICHIE has changed my life. I've had issues with my joints, specifically most with my hips. Which is hard to stay fit do to the lack of stabilizing my core. Has really put a toll on my body. Waking up in horrible pain every single day for years. My personal Pilates instructor recommended him to me. He's been at this facility for about 10 years so i assume he will not be leaving anytime soon. He used to work for the Miami Dolphins and wow.... I can imagine him fixing a lot of impact the body shouldn't endure. I'm almost in tears for the way I feel leaving today. Such relief to know I can finally get my body back to where it used to be. I've always been told I have magic hands in the world of esthetics, Well... I've found my match in the massage world. They also have a great chiropractor inside the office as well if you're looking for a fantastic adjustment. RICHIE is truly talented. Mind blown. Check him out!!

Well I was certainly impressed. Bar staff was incredibly attentive! Extremely friendly and went above and beyond. Manager David came over and made sure I was enjoying my first time experience. Bartender Jeff, new trainee Donnie, and Kristen were all wonderful. Made my experience great and will be most definitely returning. The food was spectacular. Everyone must try the banana ice cream. It was to die for. I thought it was very pricey, however, it was worth every penny. It was overall a spectacular dining experience. Can't wait to go back. Great date spot as well. Especially for valentines day!!

Wow!!!! I wasn't sure who was running this place because everything is phenomenal. I asked to speak with the GM and this lovely sweet woman, Jessica, came over. Not only was she smiley and friendly, but had super positive energy. The food and staff was incredible, but Jessica was the icing on the cake! Thank you for making, what was an unbelievable experience, even more amazing! The food was out of this world fresh and delicious. Definitely start with the vegetable crudit√©s!! The Thai grapefruit martini is so refreshing!! You won't regret it

Gail was fabulous!!! Literally told her exactly what I wanted and she grabbed the perfect pair. I continued to look through all the amazing frames and still settled with the original pair she chose for me. Made things so easy and couldn't ask for a better designer selection. Can't live without Ilori. Thanks Gail!

Wow! Creative moving and packing has exceeded my expectations! Great guys working like rock stars! I was moving from a second floor apt to another place across town on the third floor. Not only were these guys nice, friendly, and competent, but super hard workers!!! Working their tails off all day up and down stairs with any breaks. Not only did they get the job done, but all I my belongings are in tip top shape! I would recommend them to everybody I come across.

Worst place I've ever lived!!!! I live in a two bedroom apt and My apt is basically a sauna and was the least accommodating company I've ever dealt with!! I've had to sleep in the living room because it's the only place to keep cool. They said, "well can't you just keep sleeping in the living room?" EXCUSE ME!?! Unbelievable!! After 4 months and the summer was over, they came to change out the air filter and decided it was a good idea to do it while the AC was goin and now a huge black cloud bursted into my bathroom and ruined all my belongings. They said,"So what do you want us to do about it?" wow. I just want to get out of here is what I want. Have never been more miserable in my own home. Said they would at least add $200 to my deposit when I leave and now going back on their word. Do not trust them or live here. You'll actually see tin foil in a lot of the windows to try and keep heat out. Very tacky. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!

Worst food and worst service. I'm hooked on the food and service at the Scottsdale location. For some reason everything tastes different and just plain "not good". How do you mess up a Cobb salad or a burger? Will never return unless they get these people on the same page as the other location.

If you haven't checked out steak 44, you are missing out!! By far the most contemporary, trendy mastro's. The food and the service has me hooked!! All starting off with the most incredible hostess, Margarita. Always smiling with positive energy when you arrive. Service and hospitality from all is above and beyond. General manager, Kathleen, has this place running smooth. Keeping everybody happy at all times. Going above and beyond, per usual, with a smile! She's absolutely incredible at her job. Daniel, manager, makes sure everyone is treated like VIP. All around the staff is perfection!! Servers are all wonderful, eapecially Ibti! The sweetest! I usually request Alyssa. She is a top favorite server of mine! Cherry on top of the experience every time!  Now to the food.... UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Not only the best steakhouse in town, but my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona. Hands down!! If you're looking to cater to clients, agents, employees, birthdays, anniversary, etc.... This is the place to be! You will absolutely never be disappointed. Promise!!  Oh and don't forget to order the fried deviled eggs or the corn creme br√ªl√©e. Yum!! Best chefs ever!!!! Thank you kitchen for making sure perfection hits the table 110% of the time!!! This restaurant is life changing! I will always recommend this restaurant to anyone anytime.

Ok, first off... Leah is a hair genius!! Best I've ever had! And my hair is difficult!! I like my hair to be perfect and I never get anything less than perfect with this girl!!! I can't and will not be going to anyone else ever again!! Second.. She is such a pleasure to be around!! Makes her service that much more pleasant and easy going. She makes it seem so easy and the finished product is spectacular!! Please Leah... Don't ever go anywhere!! I need you in my life forever!! She is extremely accommodating to your schedule. I was running late from work and I was so aplogetic about being late because I thought I was holding her up. She told me, "drive safe, it's ok, I'll be there when you're ready." Ugh... You're amazing!!! Thank you so much for always following through with perfection!! YOU'RE THE BEST!!!

Greatest Print company I've ever worked with!!! I will never use anybody else ever again!!! Affordable, specific, wonderful staff, and of course deals with my perfectionism. Love them!!! I specifically work with Sean and Gretchen. They make everything so incredibly easy and make sure everything is flawless for me when ready for pickup. They've also delivered and installed large scale window decals for my business and made sure everything was on point!! If anyone is looking for business cards, pricing menus, window decals, signs, banners, or whatever needs you may need printed..... Definitely use PRI Graphics!!! UNBELIEVABLE SERVICE!!!! Thank you!!! You're the best!!!!

Greatest chiropractor!!!! I've been to many, and was quickly and pleasantly surprised of the quickness of my healing process from a car accident. Not only are the prices fantastic, but the adjustments and  knowledge behind it, is unbelievable. He does specific tissue massage in your necessary injured or tight areas, that will release so much tension. I thought I would need months of recovery and rehabilitation. Not with Conway! Speedy recovery is on its way!!! Thanks Jason!

Staff was very friendly. Friendly however doesn't get the job done. As a laser tech who frequents laser studios to check out who is offering great laser treatments around town, this laser did absolutely nothing. OR... The laser tech was doubting her skills with the laser as my Fitzpatrick scale of skin tone is darker. No hair was actually removed and no hair fell out. The point of laser hair removal is a temporary fix. Laser hair removal is not permanent. You should have 6-7 treatments with a great laser tech and a great laser machine to achieve the results you strongly desire. If a company is charging you for more than 7-8 sessions on an area and having you come back sooner than 8-10 weeks... You're being scammed. The first 6-7 treatments will leave you hairless for at least a year a or two. However, maintain at least 1-2 sessions a year from there to prevent the hair from growing back. Hope this helps all who are unfamiliar with the process.

I cannot express how great the service was this evening!!! Alex was on top of our orders with 6 or more lanes around us. She busted her ass!! If anyone comes here, ask for ask for Alex or Sonja!! These ladies always give superb service. When i checked in Barbi, was absolutely accommodating!! These ladies are incredibly helpful!! I will make sure to ask for them when I come back. In fact I think I'll ask them when they work. I will specifically come here and refer any clients, as a successful business owner throughout Arizona, including the #2/3 resort in the world. Being a provider for a-lister celebrities and becoming a new member to the Scottsdale community, these women impressed me thoroughly. Going above and beyond for there job. Ladies and gentlemen, ask for Alex and Sonja and you will have the best time ever!! Thank you ladies!!!

I have lived here for almost two years. New management is awful! Seems quite difficult to get a call back or even get anyone on the phone. They give no warning of renovations they began doing with current residents who were as happy as could be. They got rid of all of the fantastic staff members. Garbage everywhere. Looks super ghetto. Doesn't do anything to accommodate current residents. No discounts on rent. Went to pick up several packages, of which were extremely heavy and Percilla just stood there and watched me struggle to push them out the door and barely get them into the back of my car. Unbelievable customer service to the tenants who have all been so amazing.  Has really been quite disrupting living here. Even the new maintenance men are rude, chain smoke everywhere. I'm always walking into clouds of smoke. Gross. I'm a local business owner and people are always asking me about the biltmore area, I say everywhere but here.
