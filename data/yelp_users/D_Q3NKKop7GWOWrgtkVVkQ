GORGEOUS and GLAMOROUS!  The perfect place for your small-to-moderate sized conference.  Three buildings, all conveniently located near hotels/entertainment/the airport.  This review focuses primarily on the North building.  Hallways are filled with natural light, vivacious patterns, and earth tones.  Sculpture installations are featured around the property - make sure you catch the desert sand people upon entering the North Building, then make your way around to the blown glass tribesmen near 124B!  The information desk is centrally located (though, not constantly man-ed), and there are several dine-and-dash options for attendees (mexican, pizza, bistro, coffee - they've got your covered).  For an administration/staff lunch room, breakfast and lunch options can be confirmed as delicious.  Breakfast: fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon, oatmeal, cereals.  Lunches: salad options, taco bar, sauteed veggies, tiny tart dessert.  Coffee/tea/soda are available throughout the day.  An unavoidable "con" to this convention center: the building QUAKES when large vehicles/the tram passes by.  A bit jarring, and unsettling (especially for those of us who have vertigo issues), but certainly not a constant variable, nor one which may be remedied (just take a breath - you'll be fine!).

Let me tell ya, Breadfuit has really got my goat.   No, really...they offer a local Mountain Goat dish on their menu.  Offering meats and produce from local (or at least from sustainable) farms, this snug retreat has you loungin' you in da island, mon.  Arriving in a sand-colored, seemingly residential area, I was surprised to see the glowing "RUM" sign.  Eureka - I was in the right place.  Nautical ropes lead you to the front door, opening on the lounge area and impressive rum collection (over 100 varieties, in fact!). Cozying up in the corner to get a good shot for you lovely Yelpers, and someone (possibly staff?) proceeded to ignore my positioning and squashed me between the door and the brick wall.   - eiy.  After I got over my self-importance, I complimented the rum punch bowl and followed our waiter, Ryan, to our table-pour-duo.  At 8pm on a Wednesday night, we were two of five people in the joint (which is good, because it's a pretty small space).  Setting to the menu, I had to hold back my surprise (the prices before me were a bit higher than the online menu).  Nonetheless, I knew what my order was destined to be: the Blue Mountain Curried Goat (with farm veg, Blue Mountain curry marinade, and basmati rice $22).  When do you get that opportunity in New England??!  The dish was flavorful (sweet and spicy and plate-licking GOOD!) and plentiful....but I doubt that you'd be able to resist the temptation to scoop up every last bite.  Not into goat?  How about Rum? - The cocktail menu is just how I like it: in courses!  Each concoction offers freshly squeezed juices, tonic made in-house (like...soda stream?), aaaaand massive blocks of ice (sucks up a lot of space in the glass, but at least you don't have to worry about ice chip avalanche when you're going for the last drops of your bev).  The  Fifth & Company : a ginger brew + raspberry + bergamot essence + Mt. Gay Eclipse rum ($10).  Off the cuff, I was unimpressed (10$ for *maybe* 6oz of cocktail??  That's steep, even for Boston standards).  But sipped over the course of the evening, I found it to be a pleasant surprise of a beverage.  Sweet / tangy / zippy sips - totally worth it.  Full from the goat, I almost passed up on dessert (thank goodness my dining partner talked me out of THAT mistake).  We ordered the Jamaican puddin' pie (NO 'G'!) with rum-infused whipped cream.  It was a small sliver of a slice, but the custard-like pie was sweet and filling (can I take a tub of that whip to go?).  All in all, a great dinner (albeit, a pricey one - about $90 for two) with an excellent cocktail.  The lounge space is large enough to prevent crowding, yet small enough to create that warm intimate feel that warms you right up.  A great choice for a private party, or a relaxed semi-casual first date - - - if you can find the place.  Order up the Mollasses Fried Lollipops (chicken lollies?!) and let me know how they are!

The. Best. Breakfast.  I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.  Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).  Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.  Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way). Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.  The homefries: perfectly seasoned.  The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.  The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.  It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank. Whatever you do......go to the bathroom.  The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties....in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).  No more hints.....just enjoy....

Have you ever heard the sound that a beef steak makes when it falls to the floor?  Well let me tell ya.... the beef steak goes FLOP!  F-L-O-P  UGH.  SO promising.  Really cool vibe.  Super convenient location to my hotel room (15 stories up).  But it just didn't make the cut.  Number one : why go here when there is a perfectly good bar in the lobby of the Sheraton, offering the same limited bar selections and the same "Bar" menu (only the prices are lower in the lobby).    Number two : (the loneliest number) if you're missing additional members of your party, you're likely to get lost in the shuffle.  I made two attempts and was forgotten (ignored for larger parties/tips?) both times.  Number three : their happy hour starts at 3 - 7pm on weekdays.  You may choose from a very limited number of appetizers (essentially, the unappetizing ones), but at least cocktails are AROUND $5 (you can find cheaper/better further downtown).  Prices are pretty stiff, the usual for hotel restaurants.  An 8oz "bowl" of soup will run you about $7.  An appetizer of pretzel bites, $14.  Only vegetarian entree of white beans and greens, $22 (what?!).  Number four : the only cider they have tasted like the smell of dirty mops (though, it may have been the glass....which still isn't promising).  Number five : .......the hair that broke the camel's back.  ....O yeah.  Needing something sweet to brighten my bleary evening, I splurged on the Huckleberry Bread Pudding Sundae  (with horchata ice cream, candied pecan *singular*, caramel drizzle, and sweet creep dollop $6).  It was actually pretty good.  It was brightening my blustery blues.....until I saw the very-not-mine hair emerging from the slice of pie.  The cost of this was waved from my tab (as it should have been), but the experience was terribly off-putting.  I don't anticipate being in the area any time soon - but I'd encourage Sheraton-stayers to explore beyond the limits of the lobby...

A great Happy Hour find!  Their HH promotion run for about $4 (cocktails, appetizers, brews) and runs until 6pm on weeknights.  That being said - let me inform you of what has been missing from your earthly existence.  PRETZELS + FONDUE.  Yes.  Perfect and PLUMP pretzel bits, fluffy on the inside and absolutely sinful when dipped in the cheesy concoction delivered alongside.  Massive (filling for two!) basket + fodue ramekin only $4 during HH!  Dranks: I tried the ($4!) Mexican Maid (Hornitos Blanco, Mint, Cucumber, Lime Sour) as well as the Mule (  Beet salad was   The bill for two people (two beers, two cocktails, two entrees, and an app) came out to be around $70 - - - not too shabby!

If you live in the vicinity of the PPMC....I supremely envy your the blessing of your proximity.  Simply put: if you enjoy delicious food, don't wait for Wednesday/Saturday to roll around.  Celebrate your taste buds!  Go forth, and fill . your . face!  I popped over for Saturday morning breakfast.  I opted for the full service bar, though you may order at the counter and seat yourself (later in the day they have patio seating near a woodstove!).  At 7am it was easy to get a seat, but I had been warned that Saturday is their busiest day - so be wary of late brunch rush.  Each of their breakfast offerings were tempting, but I was captivated by the Evans-Churchill.  Two poached eggs over market-fresh veg sauteed in agave + pesto, dressing up a foundation of quinoa.  Vegan/gluten-friendly and all for $10.25.  A cup of Cartel coffee (so delicious it needs not cream nor sugar!), and my Evans-Churchill + a side of potatoes ($4 for 4 baby-fist sized potats!) - I was in heaven.  Sunshine, excellent indie-rock buzzing through the room, a video loop of reaching and growing radishes over the course of 42 days, and did I mention the flavor explosion in my mouth?  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  While I was absolutely busting at the seems, my eyes were still hungry for more more MORE of the menu!  Freshly squeezed juices offer the perfect compliment to the full bar offerings.  So SOOOO many plates: Eat the Rainbow (steamed and raw veg with a variety of sauces), Chicpea Pancakes (with banana and almond), House Pretzels (with jalapeno cheese sauce) - the list goes on, and is ever-evolving, revolving with the seasons.  And for checking in on Yelp, I got to take a cookie (a scrumptious pecan sandie) for the road!  The PPMC is one of those places that when you leave, you look longingly over your shoulder and whisper like Harry Potter, "I'm not going home, not really."  The tip top crown of my brief Western adventure, and so much to warm a polar vortex heart.  I will return to AZ, if only for another breakfast in the sunlit table tops of the PPMC.

*NOTE TO WARY FOODIES : GREAT PIZZA COMES WITH  A PRICE* Sometimes you just need a good slice (...or eight).   Slowrise sourdough crust cooked in a wood burning oven ("This gives the pizza a soft and digestible crust", says the menu...thank goodness, it's digestible!).  We decided to order one "Classica" (thin crust) and one Focaccia (yummy puffy focaccia crust!): Classica Contadina (Red Bell Pepper * Onions * Gaeta Olive * Artichoke * Mushroom $14) Focaccia Carbonara (Fior di Latte * Eggs * Pancetta (Bacon) * Onion * Panna * Pecorino Romano $15).  Trying to stick to my Veg-kick, I requested that the chef remove the Pancetta from half of 'za.  The waitress confirmed that this request was fine, but the Pancetta + onion were mixed together...leaving me with a pretty bare pizza.  "Could I have sliced tomato +olives instead of the onion+Pancetta?" - "Sure!" - "Excellent!"  When the 12-inchers arrived - piping hot and smelling like discs of heaven - We dug RIGHT in.  Let me tell you - - - some of the BEST pizza I've had; that Carbonara was right up my crooked alley.  Eggs on a pizza, sprinkled with freshly grated Peccorino, prepare for flavor explosion.  SO good, in fact, thaaaaattttt maybe (just perhaps) I umm....are one square foot of the stuff. *belch*  NOTE: *one* of the olives had a pit which I almost cracked my tooth on...  As the evening waned on, we sat back and relaxed and just enjoyed the conversation.  After about 20 minutes, the owner delivered crispy dough pieces dusted with powdered sugar (then slipped away without a word).  These were delicious, and I cannot believe that I could consume more food!  More time, more conversation, and the owner returned again, this time delivering two chilled shot glasses which he topped off with Crema di Limoncello!!  He bowed slightly, and whispered "Salute" (then slipped away).   We were left to enjoy our crisps and 'cello under the evening protection of heat lamps - - - it was pretty great!  *IF YOU ENJOY DRIFTING IN THE REALM OF THE BLISSFULLY UNINFORMED FOODIE, YOU MAY WANT TO STOP READING NOW....*  Because this is here's where it got hairy...  The check stated "1/2 Roma Tomatoes $3" and "Open FOOD $3" (I've added an image of this).  When our waitress returned for payment.  I asked her, "What is this charge for 'Open FOOD $3'?" - she shook her head, took the check, and returned back to her manager to ask.  Moments later, we were visited by the GM.  "I'm so sorry, but my hands are tied!"  He was charming, and kind, and seemed like the kind of person whom  would be really fun to grab a drink with! ....but he essentially said that he wouldn't void the charge, because then *he'd* be in hot water (not really a "good" reason to deny this request).  This meant that our $15 12" pizza was really a **$21** 12" pizza...just because I'm a vegetarian who didn't want Pancetta and was not informed that the addition of sliced tomato & olives would result in a RIDICULOUS markup...  INSANELY good pizza.....but, sheesh...what a womper.
