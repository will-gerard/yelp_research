Disappointed in my attempt at a nail service, yesterday while I was on location they booked me for the following day. Then late this morning, they called to say they double booked and I would have to come in earlier or way later. I understand things happen, but I rearranged my day to schedule the appt. Too bad Ulta!

I am so impressed with the Trophy Den. I will never go anywhere else to get any of my trophy, awards or plaque needs met. I had an urgent trophy need met today, the day before Thanksgiving. They were so helpful. They helped me pick something out and then they took care of it and it was ready within hours. It was also less expensive than any of the full prices I found online. I will only use the Trophy Den moving forward. Plus they've been local since 1968.

They literally have had my prescription in stock one time in 4 months. They have pretty crappy customer service (applies only to pharmacy) on top of it. Not only that, you feel like you may get shot at while waiting in the drive-thru pharmacy. Obviously they dive value customers like me at all. Last week when I filled antibiotics for my sick child the wait was excruciating. Even though it's the closest to pharmacy to my home, I will be finding another. Get it together CVS!

I think I was just discriminated against! This pharmacy refused to fill my prescription ( I have filled there seven plus times) saying the prescription was not written on security paper. They treated me like I was less than, or lying. I'm so shaken up, I strongly suggest you take your business elsewhere. It's not like I'm filling anything out of the ordinary. I'm positive they just violated my rights.

Bomb.com love this place and it's yummy drinks and Popsicles!  My kiddo loved the Hawaiian torta, and the guacamole is good. Good beans too! The veggie torta could stand to be improved! It's pretty plain with mayo tomatoes and avacado .

Absolutely incredible staff. Amazing doctor. They made my son feel comfortable and welcome. They explained everything to me. Best dental officefor a pediatric doctor in town. I will never go anywhere else. Dr. Creech is amazing and was recommended to me by a friend. The training on the ceiling was incredible and my child loved it.

Simply stated, I loooove this store. It was my first time in yesterday, and I'm going back this week. I'm knocking out some serious Christmas shopping in this local gem!! I've been thinking about buying re-released He-Man and his archenemy Skeletor since I left!!!

I have been a client of Matts for many years. Matt is a gifted artist and an amazing person. The way he lives his life has made him an inspiration to me, and my family. He gives back, and believes in helping people who need it. A friend of mine was dying of cancer, and getting a tattoo was on her bucket list, I told Matty and he would do whatever it took to get her in. My dear friend passed away that very week. Another example, I had a serious disfiguring scar on my arm, I was so embarrassed and constantly asked about  it. Now it is covered with vibrant colors and completely unnoticeable. There is something special about getting a tattoo by Matty, because of what he stands for as a man. I feel very honored to be his client, and to have become his friend.

Not only is the food absolutely delicious, The service is absolutely incredible. Even though we no longer live in Tempe, we make an extra special trip just to come here. The food is authentic and their vegetable selection it offers a wide variety. I love the cilantro hummus and the beet hummus.  The service though is top notch. The staff is so friendly and helped my nine-year-old son choose the best stuff for his plate. We will be back time and time again. We love you Hummus Xpress!!!!
