I was in your store this morning, 3/17 and wanted to order breakfast.  I had just picked my dog up and did not want to leave him in the car, as it gets very hot very quick.  I was told by the manager that only service dogs are allowed in the restaurant, which I completely understand.  I had asked her, the manager, who was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional, if she could take my order outside so I do not disrupt business.  She proceeded to tell me no and that me having my 12 pound dog prevented me from being able to order or purchase anything.  At this point, I was genuinely almost BEGGING her to "let" me spend my money at her business and she was refusing.  I truly understand the no dog policy and that is not my issue or concern.  It was her complete lack of respect for a PAYING customer and how incredibly rude she was towards me.  I hope that she does not treat your employees this way, as I can only imagine what type of moral this restaurant would have. I will make sure to tell everyone, on every platform I can, how disgusting she treated me and not to spend their hard earned money on a place that A. doesn't deserve it, B. are overpriced anyways and C. clearly doesn't care. I'm impressed (and deplored at the same time) that this business is doing so well that not only can they turn away customers, they can do it in the most grossly unprofessional and ill-mannered way possible. Your competition now surpasses you in every aspect and after this atrocious incident I will gladly pass 100 Paradise Bakeries (especially the one at Norterra) on my way to any one of your competitors to avoid ever being treated like this again.

This place is amazing. It's a great place to grab a bottle, or two, with your girls or go on a nice date :) service has always been fantastic. Normally because I am younger, I get treated differently ... But they held me to the same standard as the guy with the Rolex next to me! (As they should, I'm probably a better tipped). Anyways, cool little venue!

This place opens at 4pm and is busy by 4:20PM (in the lounge area). I am usually one of the youngest guests in the place but I love a good wine list! Thursday-Saturday they have live music that I have yet to check out. ALL the bartenders are great but I personally like Anthony...he's been so nice to me from the soft opening to the past two times I've visited. Usually younger girls get snubbed by waitstaff at nice places like this but he treated me with great respect.  The last two times I've been there I have sat at the bar and it was fantastic. Between the bartenders and the patrons I will more than likely start coming here on a regular basis. Remember, it is a high class fine dining restaurant so you will pay high class fine dining prices. Great for a special date night or to pop in for some great wine. I can't forget to mention the artwork! It is INCREDIBLE! (Happy hour- $3 off all glasses of wine. Sunday's-1/2 price bottles).

Came here around 10pm on a busy Friday night. We grabbed corner seats at the bar that I felt lucky we found! We ordered 4 different specialty cocktails, and no one was disappointed! I had "The Chunk". Normally  I'm not a huge fan of caramel, but this was delicious.   Second time I came back I sat at the bar alone and ordered the "Peruvian Sunrise" cocktail and the "Skirt Steak" ($10). Drink was great, and the meal was delicious! The peppers are to die for.   Service was exceptional. Meghan was my bartender :) will definitely be back!

This place is awesome.  They have modified their menu which makes it 10x better than it was before. Fruit cocktail and Gnudi are by far my favorite appetizers. They added a tuna sandwich to their sandwich selections which is now my favorite sandwich. To their main entrees they added swordfish and trout! Love this place.
