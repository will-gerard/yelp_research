Update to previous review. I was contacted by European Wax Center and we discussed my experience there. They apologized and remedied the situation by informing me that my aesthetician would get a little more training in waxing brows. I appreciated the phone call and their concern for my business. I will be giving them a second try!

I chose to visit Uptown Bridal because they carry a designer I happened to LOVE.  The store is small but their dress selection is fantastic.  I worked with Ali.  I really appreciated that they provided me with a slip to wear under each dress so that I was more comfortable. Anytime the dress was low cut we'd just push the slip down. Ali was extremely knowledgable and VERY helpful in putting into words what I was feeling or how the dress looked. She was AWESOME! I fell in love with two gowns and I had a tough time picking between the two but Ali really reminded me of what I was looking for and which dress brought together everything I wanted. It's funny. I loved my experience and loves the dress I picked from that shop. I ultimately bought my dress from a different shop but I would recommend Uptown Bridal to any one of my friends and family.   Awesome!

Let me start by saying the service was great. Barbara is an attentive and caring server who works hard to please the customer. That being said...  My boyfriend and I came to Salut after recommendations from a mutual friend. In addition Yelp stated their happy hour was till 7pm. We arrived at 6:30 and ordered two glasses of Cab. It was good and looking over the menu I was excited. The food seemed promising and reasonably priced. When I asked if the bruschetta was on happy hour Barbara informed us that they changed their happy hour till 6:30. Everything was full price. We were fine with that.   I ordered the piquillo bruschetta. My boyfriend the Pepperonata sandwich. The bruschetta had a pepper spread, green bell peppers, onion, bacon and smoked Gouda. When it came out I was already disappointed. When I order bruschetta I expect the bread to be crunchy (I know what is bruschetta...I'm Italian). The bread wasn't even close to toasted. The "pepper" spread tasted like it was BBQ sauce out of a bottle mixed with ketchup and some pepper for a kick. The bell peppers, onion, and Gouda were diced. The bacon was diced as well and cold. It's as if the chef cut bread slapped BBQ sauce on it cut the veggies and let the bacon thaw out before placing it on the top. I'm not confident the bacon was anymore then thawed out. Cooked? Not sure. The piquillo bruschetta can beat described as a Red Baron frozen pizza, left outside of the freezer, thawed and served.   My boyfriends sandwich wasn't much better. He ate maybe a quarter of it and gave up. We both focused on the fries (the only saving grace to the meal).   While their wine and beer selection is appealing, their food is disappointing.  I could make it at home for even cheaper then 9 bucks.   Barbara needs to get picked up by a place like Postino. Her work ethic and eagerness to please the customer is better served in a place that puts effort into their food. This Postino wannabe has a pretty appealing menu with a disappointing end result.   Salut!!!!  UPDATE  I got food poisoning.  This was the last meal I ate.  I'm about 95% sure it is what caused me to get sick.

I found myself in the lobby of Waxing the City when my eyebrows had been botched at another local waxing facility. I was pleased to find that Monica took her time with me. She asked me what I was looking for, whether I wanted a clean up or total reshape, she even held up the mirror for me and pointed out what she intended on doing to help fix my botched brows. She was fantastic. Talked me through the whole thing and made sure to be extra careful since I had already been waxed earlier that day. My brows came out beautifully and Monica was so attentive, when she found out I was planning a wedding she personally wrote down some vendors she's worked with and recommended. Above and beyond. They have my business from now on.
