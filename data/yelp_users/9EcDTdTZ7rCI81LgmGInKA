I've been a member at this YMCA for about 6 months. Before that I've tried many big box gyms like LA Fitness and Ballys. This place is definitely different than those other gyms.  First the good stuff:    For everything they offer, it's pretty affordable.  I love that I have never have a problem finding a treadmill (even at peak hours), there are no time limits on the cardio machines, and each treadmill has an individual TV screen with all the basic cable channels. If you are a techie like me, you can also download tv shows and movies to your iPod or iPhone watch them on the treadmill's TV via an Apple specific adapter.  Personally, I have not tried any of the classes, but there are TONS (there are 2 studios) and they aren't all offered in the middle of the work day like a lot of the gyms I had previously belonged to.  I've been doing weight training with Teri, a personal trainer there for the last several months and have really enjoyed the experience. She's extremely knowledgeable and encouraging. The personal training is also very affordable.  The not so great stuff: If you have kids, you're probably going to think this gym is awesome. However, I do not have kids and I usually find myself wading through big crowds of children just to get to the locker room and then again on the way to the exercise room. Many times there unsupervised children running around, screaming and playing in the small locker room, which I find slightly (ok, REALLY) annoying.  The weight area of the gym is can be crowded during the hours of 5:30 - 7 pm when I am there. This was more apparent in the summer, now that it is winter time it seems to be less of a problem. Finding parking can be a problem, though there is another lot near by, you just have to walk a little farther. The locker room is usually a mess with puddles and clutter. I think my usual workout time must coincide with the youth swim team. Those kids must not be too concerned about their stuff being stolen because they leave their bags and and backpacks out all over the benches. There are only 3 toilets in there and it seems like half the lockers don't have a working latch that can be locked.  Finally, they are usually closed on holiday weekends. In the winter I don't mind this (since I can get in an workout outside), but in the summer months it kills me.

Two different friends recommended this place to me. I must admit, in the 3 appointments I had there, I was impressed that all doctors, nurses and other employees were prompt, friendly and caring. Unfortunately, I must have been the patient that fell through the cracks. After my last appointment and several tests, I cannot for the life of me get anyone to call me back with the results. I have left 3 messages. At this point it's been two months and I am still experiencing the symptoms that prompted the tests, and yet I have no recommendation on what to do. They were prompt to bill me the portion of my bill that my insurance didn't cover. I hate to pay it and then have to go see ANOTHER doctor to get some answers.

My husband I had a blast learning to dance here. The people are very nice and the instructors know their stuff and are experts in teaching it.  That said, I must give warning to anyone who signs up for their introductory lessons to prepared for the HARD SELL. We fell for it and it wasn't made clear to us what we were getting into. Basically, the monthly payment we negotiated (that we could just barely afford) for our lessons effectively made us more and more indebted to them every month without our knowledge. They were giving us lessons beyond what we were paying for. When we decided to call it quits we owed them quite a bit of money!  We only got 8 lessons into the 16 we committed to before they approached us to sign up for a higher level and commit MORE money. Thank God they did because that's when we figured out that we already owed them quite a bit. If you have the means to afford $600 a month, I highly recommend this place. If you don't, please learn from us and don't fall for the "we can make it work for you" spiel.
