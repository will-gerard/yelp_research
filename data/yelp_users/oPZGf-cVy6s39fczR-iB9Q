This review is for the Northwest Valley Location (but I couldn't find it on here). (623) 241-9026; 8801 W Union Hills Dr Peoria, AZ 85382  *** Our 8 month old was acting irritable, angry, and had a high fever the night before. We were unable to get into our pediatrician's office until the next morning, so we were going to do a search for Urgent Care. My husband found a link to Good Night Pediatrics, an office that is open from 5pm-5am! What a godsend! This is exactly what we needed in order to find out what was wrong with our son, and to prevent another sleepless night. We called ahead of time, and they said to come right in. We got there, and there was no wait and the staff was very friendly. The paperwork didn't take long, and as soon as we were done filling it out, they took us right back and got us started. All of the staff was great, and the doctor took good care of us. The whole experience lasted no more than 40 minutes. The facility was clean, and kid-friendly, and had top of the line equipment. We definitely recommend Good Night Pediatrics to anyone who needs to take their child to a doctor after daytime hours.

I worked with Chad from Mr. B's Moonwalk for my kids' birthday party last weekend. From start to finish, I received nothing but the utmost professionalism and personal service. You can tell he really enjoys the service he provides to families and makes an extra effort to make sure his customer is satisfied with their service. I ordered a castle bounce house, along with tables and chairs for our party at the park. He was prompt, the bouncer was clean, and it made it really easy to be able to have them deliver tables and chairs too.  This was the 2nd time we have used Mr. B's and this experience was even better than the first 2 years ago.  I will definitely use them next time I need a bounce house!

I will start by saying that I normally LOVE Pita Jungle, so it disappoints me to only give this Downtown location 2 stars.  With 2 kids (under 3) in tow, I was meeting my best friend for a quick lunch downtown. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and keep my kids happy. It took almost 15 minutes for a server to even acknowledge me - despite my telling the hostess after 10 minutes, and trying the flag down the server who kept going out of his way to ignore me. Finally I was able to flag down another waitress, and give her our full order, so that it would arrive by the time my friend got off work.  The lunch rush was over, so I didn't expect our food  to take longer than 15 minutes. We ordered a fruit salad (the Carribean), a Lavosh Chicken Schwarma Wrap, and a kids meal. THIRTY minutes had passed and our food was still not out. My friend literally had 10  minutes to eat before she had to be back in court.  The only thing they were quick about was taking my friend's credit card.  The 2 stars was because the food was delicious as usual, but this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant for lunch. So disappointed.  I really hope they step up their game. Next time I will go back to the Desert Ridge or Arrowhead location. Much better service/experience.

I have been coming here since their opening day 3 years ago. We usually order take out but when we feel like an extra treat, we dine in for the full experience. Ninos (the owner) is always in such a great mood, friendly and welcoming - you can tell he takes pride in his food and customer service.  My husband always orders the gyro pita with fries, but tonight he ordered it will the Greek salad. Delicious as usual. We had some hummus and pita, and it such a large amount for the price - I have plenty leftover for lunch tomorrow.  I ordered the 2 meat combo (served with rice, tomatoes and onions), and while the chicken was tender and flavorful as usual, the Kafta (seasoned ground beef) really  knocked it out of the park. So tender, and seasoned wonderfully. I will definitely get that again. The rice is consistently cooked well - fluffy and light, and so flavorful.  The best part of the dining in experience, is that Ninos usually let's us sample his daily soups. Tonight, there were 2 soups - Lentil soup, and Potato soup.  They each had such unique flavor, absolutely delicious.  The potato soup had a nice kick to it on the back end.   I love supporting local businesses, and this is one of my favorites. So happy to have Good Fellas Grill in my neighborhood. Do yourself a favor and experience this awesome food. Super family-friendly, great value, and fresh, flavorful food. We love it!

I used Chrysty Clarkson as my photographer for my maternity photo session when my previous photographer was unable to fit me in her schedule. My family and I had a wonderful time throughout the shoot. Chrysty made us feel comfortable and was open to all our requests/suggestions for poses/settings etc. I have worked with photographers before who take your picture only the way they want to, and don't even listen to the needs/wants of the client. We were ecstatic when we saw the proofs. Chrysty has a great eye for her subject, and captured even the extra non-"posed" moments. There were precious memories that were created that day that we will get to keep forever, because of Chrysty. I highly recommend her for the quality, value, and customer service that you will receive.

I hired Chrysty to take our maternity pictures when I was pregnant with my second child. She was looking to expand her portfolio to include maternity shots, and I has seen her other work so I thought it was a perfect fit. She took beautiful pictures of our little growing family, and made my first born feel extra special, too. She totally captured our individual personalities, and our collective excitement. I have since recommended her to several other friends, and we are all happy with her work, her professionalism, and her flexibility with her style. Thank you Chrysty!

My husband and I had lunch here today during their soft opening. We asked John, the owner, to basically pick for us what we should eat for our first time. We were starving so we asked for 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes.  We had the Firecracker Salmon Rolls ($5), the Spring Rolls ($5), the Noodle Bowl with Pork (which is noodles and salad together, topped with the meat of your choice ($8), and the BBQ Pork Banh Mi (sandwich) ($5). Each item came with it's own sauce and we tried them all and even mixed them all at once with some of their red pepper flake chili sauce. You can't go wrong mixing those flavors.  Everything was DELICIOUS! It was fast casual Vietnamese food - healthy, fresh, and left us feeling satisfied and good about what we had put in our bodies.  The staff is friendly and helpful. The location is right off the I-17 behind the Lamar's Donuts. Try it (and all the sauces) and you will not be disappointed.  We can't wait to go again!
