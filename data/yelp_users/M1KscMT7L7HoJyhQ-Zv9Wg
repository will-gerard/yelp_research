While in Tempe for the 2011 SLUTWALK TEMPE, I Yelped and found Monti's. It was close to the start of the Walk plus it's an historic building, the oldest in the area, belonging to the famous Hayden family. That's always fun to make such a discovery. The service was fine and our server was nice and the ambience was delightful. Lots of historic photos and artifacts on the walls. The food: This is the reason for the low rating. Mainly due to my partner's ordering of a fish and chips dish. To quote: "The fish tasted like it came right off the deck of the boat." She could not eat it. The fries had a peculiar taste also and were left uneaten. Throw in the fact that it was a rather expensive dish, let's just say, this was not a happy lunch hour. My BLT with onion rings was quite good. I have no complaints.  In retrospect, I wish one of us had spoken to our server about the terrible food. Somebody in the kitchen needs to know about that fish and chips dish.  Based on this experience and the fact that along Mill Ave. there are some fabulous-looking eateries, I doubt I'll be back to Monti's any time soon.

After spending a fun day at the nearby Phoenix Zoo, I Yelped to find  a good nearby place to eat and up popped the Sonora Mesquite Grill. At first we thought, 'oh, this is a little too small', but decided to pull some tables together and go for it. We are glad we did. The lady who apparently is the owner?? took our orders and served our food and may have even cooked it up in the back. I'm not sure. The 3 salsas were so fresh and tasty...they just blew us away. Lots of cilantro and lime. Yum. Two of us ordered the Veggie Burrito and it came piping hot and was delicious. My partner had the same thing only in the bowl style. Our other friend ordered a taco and enjoyed it very much. When the lady who served us found out we were from Tucson, we told her we'd found out about her restaurant from YELP. She asked to see the reviews on my Droid and was thrilled to see so many people enjoy eating here. Yes, it's small. And yes, you will wait a tad longer than other places to get your food but it is worth it.

After driving up to Scottsdale to see the Roald Amundsen Railroad car used in FDR's funeral, I got out my trusty Droid and Yelped the area for restaurants. The Spotted Donkey's reviews caught my attention.   How could I not like a place that has photos of donkeys and burros all over??  The shrimp tacos for $13 were delicious and attractively presented on a long white plate. It looked beautiful. (photo included).  HOWEVER, my partner said if she had to choose between this dish and La Salsa's Baja Shrimp Tacos, a lot less costly and just as tasty, she'd stick with La Salsa.   The cheese enchiladas and salad with salsa/guacamole were outstanding. I was very full by the time I had polished THAT off.  Only a couple observations: They charge you an extra $5 for salsa and chips. Wish they would include it with the meal.  I was seated at a table that had a halogen spotlight that was boring down on me....all the while the AC was blowing cold air down on the table. I changed seats and all was well.  Our servers were polite and attentive and overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience....just real different from what we love in South Tucson.

We enjoyed lunch here for the first time after reading all the rave reviews from fellow Yelpers. I had the tuna salad and it had a real nice flavor thanks to the dill and the fresh croissant, all accompanied by string fries. Others in my group had the salad which they enjoyed, though in one of the bowls there was too much dressing. They were served attractively in a large slanted bowl. You can enjoy your meal inside or out. Servers were very attentive. It was a bit spendy but  I'm glad we ate here while in the area.
