2 hr delay and counting so far. I could have driven to Vegas.  Updated to one star. After taking a half day off, paying for parking, boarding the dog, waiting 2 hours for a delayed "plane swap", departing the gate, then returning to the gate for mechanical issues with our replacement plane, and now 1 agent to take care of customer service issues... I won't be flying US Airways again.

Rather pricey. 1 round of drinks and 3 sushi rolls came to over $70 before tax/tip for only two people. Service was just okay. Happy hour ends early, at 5:00 PM.

This is probably one of my top 3 favorite restaurants. The food is EXCELLENT, big selection from American to Italian to good seafood (for Arizona at least). The portions are large, get a TOGO box and have a full meal the next day. I've eaten here at least a half a dozen times, never had a bad experience. Cost is VERY reasonable. I have nothing bad to say about this place, no complaints.   Park in the subway lot and walk over, lot gets congested with cars and pedestrians.

Southwest Airlines is making my return flight to Phoenix possible, after U.S. Airways cancelled my flight.

I think I may have food poisoning after eating here 4-5 hours ago. Achy joints, running to the bathroom, chills... Friggin' McDonalds.

This is my grocery store. Friendly staff, good sales, decent produce, good bakery with tasty carrot cake made by a friendly German lady; no fresh bagels though. I do 85% of my shopping here.   Monday deli fried chicken deal is great, as long as the chicken hasn't been sitting out too long. I ask and request fresh chicken now after having been burned twice with dried up chicken that sat too long.   WARNING:  if you are going to buy alcohol, do not bring your teenage kids in line with you. I witnessed a cashier refusing to sell a 6-pack of beer to a well dressed middle aged man because his daughter was with him in line and she didn't have her ID. I heard the whole story, the guy was understandably upset, who happened to pick up his ASU daughter from the gym on the way home from work at the end of the day. This sounded completely ridiculous to me and unfortunately for this guy, common sense didn't prevail that day.

Don't do business at this unethical business. My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for "account inactivity" fees. They are a bunch of crooks.  It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business.   Account closed.

Under new management, no longer Danny's.   Not impressed with the service. Paid $40 for the most expensive wash/wax. Upon leaving, I notice the inside still all dusty, wasn't even touched. Turned back around and they're fixing the problem, but still.

Update:  they seemed to have corrected the problem regarding long wait times to get food. I can now call in an order, make the drive, and pickup my food in 15 minutes. This seems much more reasonable than how it was before.

Dishonest pricing. Gas at pump is more expensive than what's posted on the sign to get you into the place. Left, didn't buy.

The worst airlines ever. After a 6 hr delay to get to Vegas, ruining any nighttime plans on Friday night, my early Sunday return flight has been cancelled.   Any of my friends, please NEVER FLY US AIRWAYS.   Everyone who has checked a bag has been told to get their bag from baggage claim and make other arrangements. What a joke of an airline. A huge FU to US Airways/American.

This place was not very good at all. Maybe it was the fact that the oven was broken on 11/15/2013, a little detail the server neglected to tell us until after our drinks arrived. So we couldn't order from half the menu. Dishes run $16-$22, which I thought was a little pricey, especially considering we didn't get anything with our entrees; no bread, no soup, no salad.    The lobster ravioli was just okay. There was some lobster, but mostly just a mix of some seafood/krab salad  made with mayonnaise stuck in a ravioli shell covered with some orange sauce. I was expecting much more. Didn't come close to the Lobster ravioli at macaroni grill.   The Mediterranean pizza was a little better, included all the right elements, but just lacked any sort of spark to set it apart. And we both got heartburn after dinner, not sure if that was from pseudo seafood or garlic on the pizza.   The bill for two people was around $60, not including the tip. The servers seemed understaffed, there wasn't any bussers to clean tables, so servers had to do it all.   We wanted to support small business, but I felt like I got ripped off for what we paid.   The competition from Red White and Brew is going to be tough to beat if this business expects to stay in business with the poor menu selection and bland flavors that we experienced.   We won't be returning.

Boooo!!!  Shop around on CD trade-ins.  I was just offered only $31 on over 300 CD's. Same lot, Bookman's just gave me $80 in credit for 40 CD's.  F.Y.E. also offer a better offer, $0.75-$1.00 per CD vs. Zia offer of $0.10 a CD.
