I really enjoy this museum.  I have been several times since moving to the valley and always have a good time.  There are usually special exhibits as well as the permanent collection.

Ok, these guys get five stars from me for many reasons.  Before my visit today my other experience with them was for my wedding cake.  They were very courteous and helpful, although I ended up going with a cheaper option.  Today, however, they definitely earned five stars.  I was there for a meetup event.  We got a tour of their facilities.  The owner personally did the tour, and did a great job considering I brought my toddler, who screamed through about 75% of the tour.  At the end, he gave us a cookie and thanked us for coming.    I know that some people think toddlers should be locked away so as not to annoy the general populous, but it's nice to know not everyone feels that way :)

I love this place.  They're pizza is so good.  Needed a quick bite the other night and it took less than 5 minutes to get a slice to go.  Very happy with everything.

I was studying for finals and so driving back and forth to campus a lot.  All of a sudden one evening my car's coolant light went on.  I take care of my car and so was concerned about the light.  I took it into Purcells where they proceeded to tell me that my car might overheat and explode if I continued to drive it, thus making me their captive.  I called my fiancee and told him the deal.  A couple hours later Purcells contacted me and said the engine needed repair and would cost around $900.  I asked if there were any sort of discounts and they said no.  Then when my fiancee went in they magically made it only cost $700.  I still don't think anything was wrong with my engine after all is said and done, but just paid them and went on my way, vowing to never come back.

I love the Phoenix Art Museum.  I love the permanent exhibit as well as all of the traveling exhibits they are able to get.  I have been lucky enough to see the Monet and Egyptian exhibits when they came and were amazing.

Yum!  I have been here a few times for take-out and have been happy with my meal every time.  So far, I have tried the Thai Tofu, the Spicy Tofu and the Honey Tofu.  This is my new favorite Chinese take-out joint.

If you think all smoothies are the same then you have never tried Robeks!  When I worked in the Biltmore area I used to get their all fruit smoothies for lunch all thie time, but now only go every once in a while.  I stopped in with my son this morning and was soon reminded why I loved this place.  It is owned by a super nice couple who are always really friendly when I come in.

I love this place!  The staff is always friendly and they have a great children's section, which not only has a great selection of new and second-hand books, but a large selection of quality toys (aka, educational and not made out of plastic!).  I also love that there is a Wildflower connected, in case you are craving something to snack on.

Stopped here for a quick bite while doing errands, and I have to say the treats were way tasty.  I shared a butter croissant, Rose & Raspberry Macaroon and Organic Orange Macaroon with my husband and son.  My favorite was the Rose & Raspberry.  The flavors were paired perfectly... the delicate rose with the tarty raspberry was truly beautiful.  The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is that the coffee drink I had ( I think it was called a Vanilla Bean Latte?) was WAY too sweet.  I mean, I have a sweet tooth and I did not even want to drink this thing.  It was gross.

I have been to turn style a few times, and just feel like I can never find anything I really like here.  I have found a few cute kids clothes, but over all not impressed.

I bought the Groupon and was concerned after reading the other reviews, but I was really impressed with the team that I got.  Yolanda and Janelle did a great job with the 2 hours they had and got everything clean that I asked.  I was very happy.

Ok, this place has THE BEST coffee I have ever tasted.  Bottom Line.  I didn't get the "everyone is required to wear skinny jeans" vibe that a previous reviewer stated, so I would definitely give this place a try before writing it off.  If you love coffee, this place is not to be missed.  And I am not talking about the "Venti Chocolate Chip Frap" type of coffee.  If you like drinks like that then this place is not for you, but if you love the idea of each cup of coffee being made specifically for each customer and supporting an establishment that is truly passionate about their product, than check this place out.

I love this store!  I wish it was closer to me, but is worth the trek over to Old Town Glendale.  The first time I went there I was blown away by all the cute things they had at very affordable prices.  I literally had to do a double take at a top I was going to try on that I was expecting to be around $60-$70 and was only $15!!!  Amazing, amazing selection.  There is also a children's section, where I got my son some second had shoes for $3!  So awesome, I will definitely be back.

I have only been once and thought it would be a good place to take children over 3 or so.  My son was about 6 months when we went so didn't get a lot out of it.  The "infant room" is not that great and he wasn't really able to interact with anything.

I love this place.  I had the raw green papaya salad and it was amazing.  I love how they use local ingredients in everything.  Will definitely be back :)

I love the idea of "self serve" frozen yogurt.  My son also loves to get to pick the different flavors.  Always a great experience :)

How have I not reviewed Loveland yet!  I feel like I am there all the time!  This place has a great vibe and boasts a great selection of women's and children's clothing.  She also has a large selection of local products, such as Strawberry Hedgehog Soaps, and her jewelry selection is awesome!  Thanks Loveland for being such a great local business!

I originally started going to this place because I got a groupon for them, but I definitely want to continue my practice here.  Yoga Kamala focuses on the internal benefits of yoga, while also keeping in mind physical benefits.  I feel like I am a calmer, happier, and more whole me after leaving one of the classes at Yoga Kamala.  You definitely have to check it out :)

I took my 18 month old son to MIM a few weeks ago, and so didn't get to see everything due to the fact that I was operating within the confines of his attention span.  We got to see the African exhibit, as well as part of the Middle East and Asia, as well as the experience room where you can test out different instruments.  It was so much fun!  Will have to go back and see everything.

This is the best food I have had in a while, so good!  I had the BLT with veggie bacon and it was awesome and totally satisfying.  My son had the humus and veggies, which he loved.  My husband and mother in law had the vegie burger, which they did not rave about, but said that it was ok.  It is a very cheery interior and we saw some other families come in and dine as well (always good to find more child-friendly places).  This place is truly a gem, will definitely be back!

Don't really feel like I need to write anything, since I was there with patrick b., I think he covered everything.  I will say that as a Gnocchi lover I am constantly disappointed by bad Gnocchi whenever I order it at Italian restaurants.  This was not one of those instances.  The Gnocchi was executed perfectly, as was the wonderful pesto that I asked for to accompany it.  I feel very lucky to have such a great restaurant close to home, we will definitely be visiting chef Andy here again!

Ok, so I was here with my son and some friends the day before Super Bowl, so I'm sure it was a little more crowded than normal, but the waitstaff were still friendly and helpful.  We just got stuff at the coffee bar to go and I was happy with the food.  Will have to come back to eat sometime.
