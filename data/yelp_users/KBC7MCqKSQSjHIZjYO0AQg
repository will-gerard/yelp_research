I have taken my Goldwing to their service department, and was impressed with the level of service I received.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about their parts department.  Here's my awful experience with Apache Motorcycle parts department:  Late in the day on a Saturday, I called to ask about a pair of bolts that I need to replace.  Once the part number was identified, I was told that the bolt would be special ordered and the price was $5.00 each plus tax.  I was shocked at the price, but ordered  them anyway, paying for them with my Visa.  After ordering, I posted on the Goldwing forum that I had found the bolts I needed and that they would be $5.00 each.  I received several responses (mainly telling me that I'm crazy) informing me of a multitude of place that sell that same bolt for $1.09.  One of those places was Western Honda, which is about 15 miles further from me than Apache.  After confirming the price was indeed $1.09 each, I placed the order with Western Honda and immediately called Apache to cancel.  Unfortunately, their automated system answered, telling me that they were closed and would not reopen until 10:00 am Tuesday.  I then posted a message on their website's "Contact us", telling them that I had found the bolt cheaper and to cancel my order and credit the charge back on my Visa.  Tuesday morning at 10:00 I called parts and confirmed that I wanted to cancel the order.  I was told that there would be a 20% restocking fee since Honda had already shipped the bolts to them.  Really?  I doubt it.  They have basically lost what could have been a lifetime customer because of a $2.16 "restocking fee".  They will probably now sell the same bolts to another unsuspecting customer and make an additional profit.  I had hoped that Apache Motorcycles would be my "go to" place for service, since they are the closest to where I live.  Now I plan to take my Goldwing, and my business to Western Honda, which is an additional 15 miles away.  But I refuse to do business with companies who care so little about their customers.

After I posted this review, they decided to refund all but 10 cents of my money.  Why they kept 10 cents, I don't know.  At least they tried to do something to correct a horrible customer service experience, but it took a dispute with my bank, my comments on Facebook, and this review on Yelp to get them to do something.

Beware of Apache's unscrupulous sales tactics.  I went to Apache to look at trading in my Victory Vision and purchasing a Can Am Spyder. Due to physical problems, I'm needing to go to three wheels.  I wandered around by myself for about 5 minutes without anyone offering assistance, and finally tracked down a salesman. He turned out to be the rudest, most uninformed, indifferent salesman I have ever encountered. As I was asking him questions about the product, he contunually tried to turn and run away, as if I was keeping him from something more important than talking to a customer. When I wasn't looking, he disappeared into a cubicle.  I walked out of the store in frustration. I later learned that his name is Shane, but he should change it to Shame.  I was later called by another salesman named Jesse who was following up on the online inquiry I had made on the Can Am website.  I told him of my experience, for which he apologized and assured me that he would make sure I was treated properly.  I gave Apache another shot at my business, and went to see Jesse.  Jesse was very polite, very friendly, knowledgable about the product, and eager to make things right for me.  Jesse is the reason I gave this dealership two stars instead of one. Unfortunately, Jesse is a rookie salesperson and it appears that he has been trained to treat every customer like an idiot.  After selecting the model that I wanted off the floor, it was time to find out how much I could get for my trade in, how much they were willing to sell the Spyder for, and how much it would  cost "Out the Door".  Jesse disappeared into his manager's office, and after several minutes came out with a sheet of paper in his hand. He took me to a desk and flashed the paper in front of me. The paper was filled with undecipherable notes and numbers, except for the very bottom, which he pointed to. It was the out the door price. I asked if I could look at the paper, and he just waved it around, telling me that it's not important. I said yes, it is important, and asked if I could have a copy of it. He said he wasn't allowed to give it to me, but instead wrote the out the door price on the back of his business card.  I asked if I could talk to the Manager, and was taken to the cubicle where the manager was seated. I began talking to the man about such things as FICO scores and the different models, and how much the FICO 8 model differed from the FICO Auto 2 etc.  He just sat there with a glazed look on his face. I asked him a question, and he was completely clueless.  You would think that a sales manager who deals with credit applications all day long, would at least have elementary knowledge of credit matters. This guy was a complete baffoon. It seems that all these people know is how to try to pull wool over customers eyes and sell them whatever they can sell for however much money they can out of them. Apparently, they aren't used to dealing with sophisticated, knowledgeable buyers.  I began contacting Can Am dealers in neighboring states, requesting quotes on the model I was looking for. I received phone calls and emails from half a dozen dealers, eager for my business, and perfectly willing to provide me with a breakdown of price, trade-in allowance, tax, document fees, etc.  Each one had a bottom line price much lower than what Jesse and his Manager had quoted to me.  Again, I wanted to give Jesse a chance at the sale, so I called him and asked him to please give me a break down of how they had arrived at their out the door price.  He told me that it was against Apache's policy to provide that information to the customers.  I said thank you, and terminated the call with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I did end up purchasing my Can Am Spyder RT Special Series from another dealer.  I got a great deal, and they were very up front right from the start as far as how much I was paying, how much tax, trade-in value, etc.  It's a shame that a guy like Jesse is representing such a sleazy outfit as Apache. I would have loved to give the sale to Jesse, but not to Apache.

I arranged a group of people to meet at this restaurant for dinner.  I arrived first, and went to the bar to have a drink while awaiting the others. I ordered a mug of domestic beer and handed my credit card to the bartender. I was absolutely shocked when she handed me the receipt to sign.  $4.85 for 12 oz of domestic beer?!!?  I immediately texted the others and told them we had a change of plans.  We went to another restaurant down the street where they appreciate customers and don't try treat us like suckers. ( I had a 16 oz micro brew for $3.50)  They lost out on a couple hundred dollars in business so they could hit me for nearly $5.00 for $0.50 worth of product.  I don't care how good their food is, I won't let any restaurant get away with gouging customers.

Beware of the sleazy credit department  I was shopping for a Spyder RT and brought my Victory Vision to the Chandler store to discuss a trade in and purchase. I explained to the salesman (I'm not going to mention his name because he is not part of this review) that once we arrived at an out-the-door price, I would apply for the loan at my credit union, where I have had three motorcycle loans, and an excellent relationship.  I was told that it would go faster if they put through the application, because of the software that they have. Like an idiot, I filled out the app.  (I'll never do that again!) Once again, I emphasized that I only wished to apply with my credit union. With my credit score of 765, I was confident that I'd be approved. I got a call later in the day from the salesman telling me that my credit union had turned me down. "WHAT?"   So I called the credit union to ask why, and was told that the credit manager had put in an application for a $38,000 loan to be repaid in 36 months.  This is a machine that retails for $27,000!  The reasons I was declined were (1) the loan to value ratio was too high and (2) the payments would have been too high based on my income.  As if this wasn't bad enough, the next day I received alerts from my credit monitoring service that there were multiple inquiries.  I took a look, and sure enough the idiots at Ride Now had taken it upon themselves to blast my social security number and request for a $38,000 loan on a $27,000 machine to a dozen different lenders. Needless to say, they were all declined for the reasons above.  I spent the next few days writing letters and calling the creditors that had pulled my credit, telling them that I didn't make application with them, and to please rescind the inquiry. I was told by most of them that the only way they could do it would be with a letter from Ride Now stating that the credit pulls were in error. A few of the lenders understood my plight, and revoked the inquiries.  I called the corporate office of Ride Now and spoke to Heidi Byers,  the corporate credit manager. After explaining the situation to her, she promised to call me back. She didn't.  I wrote a lengthy letter to her, and copied the lenders in question. One creditor called me and told me they had similar problems with Ride Now in the past, and promised to remove the inquiry. I called Heidi Byers again and left a voice mail message. Several voice mails later, she still would not call me back.  My story has a happy ending. I purchased a Spyder at a different (more reputable) dealership, for a great price.  After a great deal of letter writing, I was able to get most of the bogus inqiries removed from my credit file.  Ride Now is a sleazy company, at least in terms of the way they handle credit applications. When someone tells the salesperson that they ONLY want to apply with a particular lender, they have no right to blast it out to dozens of lenders. What they did was a violation of my trust, and I will never buy from them.

This review is about my experience with the service department, and does not in any way exonerate the sales department for the horrible experience I reported in another review. ________________________________________________________________  I was hesitant to bring my Spyder to Ride Now after my experience with the sales department, and in light of all the horrible reviews about Ride Now around the country.  But they are close to my house, and I thought I'd give the service department a shot when I need some minor warranty work done.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The service department is like night and day compared to the sales department.  Within minutes of talking to service adviser Drew, I got a sense that they really cared about me as a customer.  Drew proved to be knowledgeable, helpful, and very customer service oriented.  When I made the appointment with him earlier in the week, he estimated a two hour wait.  When I checked in this morning, he told me that it would probably be a lot less than that.  So I hung around for awhile. As I was standing around, several people from the service department politely asked if I was being helped.  That was impressive. In just over an hour Drew came out and told me that I was ready to go. Not only did they fix the issue, they even washed my Spyder!  They really made me feel like a valued customer.  I highly recommend Ride Now Chandler for service!

All I can say about this place is that it is a classic tourist trap.  They know that the snowbirds will flock in no matter how horrible the food is.  I am a local who has avoided this place until today when I finally succumbed to a friend's insistance that I try it.  I ordered the enchalada's.  What  a disgusting mess was delivered to my table.  The enchalada's were hard as logs and I could barely cut them with a knife. The taste was not much better.  It was quite apparent that this product was frozen and then microwaved prior to serving.  Despite the fact that I was quite hungry, barely ate any of my lunch.  Again, this is a tourist trap and clearly they care little about the quality of the food.  It's a nice scenic area, but do you yourself a favor an eat before you drive up there.  This food is horrid.

It was one of those nights when we didn't feel like going out. So we did a search, and ordered from Bobo. What a mistake.    The first sign of a problem was they delivered the food within ten minutes of our order.  I appreciate prompt service, but getting it in ten minutes is a bit suspicious, especially when we live 5 minutes away from the place.  The driver quickly scurried away before I could say anything.  The second sign of a problem was when we opened the containers and discovered that they had brought us white rice instead of the fried rice we ordered.  But that was only the begining of the nightmare.  The soup was totally lacking in flavor. The pot stickers were burnt and hard as a rock, with sauce that was as thin and tasteless as water. The egg rolls were also over cooked and hard as rocks.  All in all, the food was barely edible.  My guess is that this food was leftover from lunch, and they tossed it into the microwave and delivered it to us. If this wasn't a delivery and we were in their store, we would not have accepted this, but the delivery man was long gone before we discovered the horrors. Avoid this place and order a pizza instead.

I've been a Popeyes' fan for 40 years, and I have to say this is the worst franchise (store)  I have ever encountered.  They consistently get the orders wrong, the cashiers are slow and inept (There's always a line even during slow periods), and the place is a mess.  The trash cans are always stuffed so the customers can't dispose of their trash.  Most of the times I've stopped here I've had to search around for a napkin dispenser that isn't empty.  This is not an isolated incident, as I have stopped here multiple times with the same experience. Yesterday, I ordered my usual 8 piece box of thighs and drumbsticks (mild), and when I got home and got the dinner ready to serve, discovered breasts and wings in the box (spicy).  Nobody in my family likes white meat. We live too far away from this location to make it worth driving back so we were stuck with it. From now on I'll be sure to check before I leave the store. Popeyes should have done a better job in vetting this franchise owner, as he is giving the product a bad name. If this location had been my first experience with Popeyes, I would never again be a customer.  P.S.  I sent this review directly to Popeyes Corporate, and shortly thereafter received a phone call from a very rude person named Carlos who identified himself as the General Manager of this location.  He offered no apology, no empathy, and kept on calling me "Sir" even though he knows I'm a female.  Instead of trying to solve the problem, his tact was to scold me for not bringing it up to a Manager on Duty.  Apparently he's upset that now Popeyes Corporate is aware of the inadequate management of this location.
