Extremely disappointed with the customer service at the take out counter. For one, Miguel the guy who took my order over the phone was very unpleasant and rude. Apparently there has been recent changes to the menu that he failed to explain and as a result, when I picked up my order it was incorrect.  When I kindly asked questions his tone was very unpleasant and rude and you could tell he was not happy to be taking my order and wanted to get off the phone. When I asked questions after paying to the cashier Senyaceth, she was quick to get the manager when all I asked were simple questions regarding my order. Afterwards, she was very unhappy that I had to reorder my meal and was rude the entire time. Never asked for anything free, and I paid for my entire meal. I understand Saturday nights are busy, I myself work in the customer service industry and agree that it gets very busy. However, that's not an excuse to be unpleasant and rude.  As a frequent at Oreganos I am highly disappointed and hope there customer service returns to what it used to be.

Best bloody Mary's for $5.00. I definitely recommend the huevos rancheros or the carne adovada.

Chicken pa-naeng was absolutely amazing. Nice and spicy with the sticky rice was just perfect. Lunch portion was more than enough to satisfy the palate. Will definitely be going back!

Awful experience, immediately seated which was probably the best part of the experience.  Waitress took our order, but never actually placed it. Waited 45min for our food, owner didn't seem to care, never got one apology. Super disappointed will never return.
