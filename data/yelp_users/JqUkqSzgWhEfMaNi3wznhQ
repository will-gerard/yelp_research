Absolutely no complaints. I was seated immediately and the waitress was very helpful. I wanted to order a omelette but I wanted to do some substituting. She advised to take a look at this new selection called "My Incredible V.I.B". You get 4 selections of 30 menu items for $7.95. I got a 2 egg cheese omelette, 2 scrambled eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage. It was cheap and filling. The soda refills were never asked for just brought. Really happy with the service. Food was 3 stars but service was a clear 5. 4 seems a little high but the service was that good.

The tots here are awesome. You get a ton and they are generous with the toppings of cheese sauce, bacon, sour cream & chives. The tots were perfectly fried.

Sadly I was in Vegas for business not pleasure. No fun for Joshie boy. Alas I was hungry and amazingly was not feeling burger. GPS brought me here and while this place is a chain they are putting out sandwiches they can be proud of. After viewing the menu board it read that the "Bobbie" is their signature. Nuff read that is what I ordered. Ordered the small ("9 sub on a Kaiser roll) and it was loaded with turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing. It had light mayo. For the first time in my life I thought this sandwich could use a little more mayo but other than that it was hearty, well made and had a wonderful flavor combination.

The Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Egg topped with Green Chile Hollandaise was a WOW dish. Very attentive service. Personally the decor is nice but some of the ambience is stolen because you can see out on the Casino Floor. Minor issue, great food but as you would expect with a casino restaurant , it was pricey

What an outstanding experience. The service is attentive and professional without being suffocating. Ordered the domestic wagyu filet and it was cooked perfectly. The lobster bisque was loaded with lobster and the cream broth was silky smooth. It will be an expensive evening but well worth it.

Really good food is the only thing that was on my mind when leaving the Rancho. Ordered the Tia's Plato with chicken. The chicken was amazing. It was so tender and well flavored. The refried beans had a smokey flavor I will be craving long after my visit. The place was packed but the service did not drop off.

Loved this place. Amazing beer selction. The Vampire Slayer which is Ground steak, roasted garlic aioli, Muenster cheese on a Potato Bun was a homerun. Being able to order Kronenbourg 1664 at a bar was even better.

Ordered the "Carne Asada & Huevos" and I requested the eggs medium. I think that threw them for a loop. They forgot my salsa and sadly they never got around to bringing it. The carne asada was of good quality but was served lukewarm, which tells me it was sitting. Oh well I left full at least.

This is a good pizza. Went with two slices of cheese and honestly one was all I needed. These are huge slices. Big enough to fold.

There is still a place in Vegas, at a casino that doesn't kill you on price. Decent food and you don;t have to go on run at the Craps table to afford it.

Stopped in for a quick bite during lunch. Came in wanting Burnt Ends but the server recommended the Texas Beef Brisket. After the first bite of this smokey, well seasoned brisket I forgot I was eating at a chain. Friendly service and a very fair price.

When it comes to the Mt. Rushmore of fast food burger joints with a drive thru you will see the signs of In n Out, Whataburger, Culver's, Steak nShake and Wendy's. These joints serve fresh beef and that is criteria #1. Shake Shack, Habit, Smashburger and Five Guys don't have drive thru and have their own separate mountain. Culver's hasn't made it to my neck of the woods but if work drops me by a location I am always going to visit. The Butterburger is one of life's little treats.  Add a slice of cheddar and you are in business. A simple burger prepared exquisitely. Fresh beef nicely griddled and seasoned, a buttered and toasted bun, a touch of mayo, pickle and red onion. Symphony.  Watch out they are generous with the onion and that can overpower. The frozen custard puts just about every ice cream I have had to shame. My advice , if you see a Culver's, pull over immediately.

Below average Mexican at exhorbitant prices. The beer came in a plastic cup. The only thing worthwhile was sitting outside overlooking the strip.

First time visiting this establishment. I had some initial confusion withe ordering process. Once figured out it is quite easy. Take bag of the protein you want, put name on bag, select ingredients, give to cashier. Ordered the "Wicked" wich which they say is the signature sandwich. It has Roast beef, Turkey, Bacon, pepperoni, and ham. You select three cheeses (went with american, swiss, mozzarella) with yellow mustard. Had them toast it and it was delicious. The proteins and cheese muddle together as tends to happen when you have too much of a good thing. All in all a fine experience.

After visiting a customer the boss and I were in the mood for lunch and being a perfect day in the Valley of the Sun we were looking for a place with outdoor seating and Yelp guided us here. It was noon and the dining room was virtually empty which made for easy seating and quick service. Order at the counter, get a number and they bring your entree when it is ready. Ordered a slice of the Taste of Italy Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushroom, Green Bell Pepper, Red Onion), side salad and a soda for $8.95 plus tip. The salad was very carrot heavy. The pizza crust wasn't cracker style but more had the mouthfeel of stale and the sauce didn't bring much tomato flavor. The slice was small and had the look and taste of struggle. A war was waged against the proteins by the veggies and cheese and they had advanced and pushed my proteins to one side. I was left with my proteins straddled to one side and a veggie pizza for the most part. In my world the veggies enhance the proteins they can't be the star. The final blow was as we were getting ready to leave I noticed a lunch deal on the back of the menu touting two slices and a drink for $5.50. Shame on me for not knowing the menu front to back on my first visit but I would like to think the server might have mentioned it since it would have saved me a few bucks and netted me a second slice. On second thought scratch that.

I was expecting so much more. I first had visited a Cane's about 8 years ago in Vegas just after the wife and I had landed and we needed to get our grub on. That visit the chicken was juicy, the batter was damn near tempura style, the crinkle cut fries were that perfect balance of crunchy yet soft on the inside, the dipping sauce was a wonderful taste of garlic and pepper and creamy deliciousness and the toast was perfectly toasty and buttery. We were blown away and I have told countless friends that they were the best fast food joint out there. Fast forward to present day and my favorite fast food joint served a dud. The chicken was overcooked, the batter was too crunchy and overdone and my fries were limp. But you say, "Josh I can see the container, you took it to go, surely that caused some of the problems?". I say no. The restaurant was a block from my hotel and was only in the container for a short time and could not have caused said damage. If it did shame on Cane's for offering drive thru. Cane's, we will always have Vegas.

Was quite impressed with the selection. The I love bacon burger is fantastic. The flavor of the bacon and brisket was a few notches above a beef patty. Surprisingly juicy burger with a bacon mayo that was heavenly. The brioche bun and Gouda cheese was A+ The vanilla shake and onion rings were worth the price .

The Sky Harbor has many great options for food and this place is no exception. They do pizza, sandwiches, burgers, and salads. I was feeling pizza and I ordered the "Fallen Angel". It came with sausage, fennel, onions, mozarella and red sauce. The pizza was well cooked with a nice chew and the pizzas are single serving. I was impressed.

As I was driving back to my hote land I noticed a sign for Guthrie's. Chicken sounded good so I stopped. I had no idea they were a chain. Walking in I noticed they had a big screen tv tuned to ESPN, nice touch. Was greeted by the cook and a few moments later my order was taken by the register lady. Food was out quickly. I think Rasing Cane's fingers might be a smidge better but it is razor close. The dipping sauce is wonderful. It has a hint of garlic and works with the chicken the fries and even the Texas Toast.

Sky Harbor is the best airport I have been to in terms of food. With quality offerings like Four Peaks, Humble Pie and La Grande Orange you have some great choice. I am adding another great little spot for your consideration with Sir Veza's. Tacos, burritos, salads and even burgers are on the menu. I ordered two chicken tacos with a side of black beans and rice. The tacos come wrapped in two soft corn tortillas (they also offer flour), grilled chicken topped with a chipotle crema, cilantro,  queso fresco, and fajita veggies. The crema had heat and made their salsa toppings irrelevant. The tacos are big so please don't be scared of the high price tag, you will be full. They are very generous with the protein and if you can find a seat in the crowded dining room you are all set.

Holy heck Sky Harbor has blown my mind once again. This place deserves a medal, not for the best pizza but for the best deal I have ever received at an airport. For under 8 bucks I got two massive slices of pizza that were tasty. Ziegler's NYPD Pizza delivered incredible value. The local Arizona chain is serving big, greasy slices on the cheap and besides being wallet friendly they are taste bud friendly. Ordered the Big Kahuna (ham, pineapple, basil, mozzarella) and Brooklyn's Favorite (sausage,pepperoni, basil and mozzarella). They were big, greasy and foldable and made my seat mates on the flight home a bit jealous.

The food was solid 4 star but it was at the airport so I am jumping it up a notch. My taste buds were simply blown away!! Ordered the S.O.P which has sausage, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, ricotta cheese and tomato sauce. The sauce tasted very tomato-y and fresh, the cheese was perfect, the sausage and onion complimented and the crust was crispy but not burnt. Really great pizza that I would happily eat outside of the airport walls.

I am completely blown away by the food options at Sky Harbor. With this place and Humble Pie, these are restaurants I would patronizee outside the airport. Four Peaks has a nice open layout and plenty of TVs. The bartender new his beer so when he recommended the Kilt Lifter I went with it. Ordered the Italian Beef Beer Bread which had roast beef with sautéed red onion, green peppers, mushrooms, mozzarella and a garlic honey mayo rolled in their fresh baked beer bread. This is one of the best wraps I have had. The beer bread has much more character and depth than regular wraps. I loved it.

Not what I expected. I assumed this was a drive thru fast food restaurant chain but it is actually a full service sit down restaurant chain. I would put them in the same group as a Johnny Rockets. They have the 50's style decor and friendly wait staff that Johnny Rockets has but that is where the similarities end. The Cheeburger Cheeburger burger absolutely destroys Mr. Rocket. I ordered the "Classic" on a Kaiser with American, chopped garlic, onion and pickle. You can select multiple free toppings ala Five Guys. Perfectly cooked medium, hand formed fresh beef that was wonderfully seasoned. This is a first rate burger. Accompanying my burger was an order of "B.O.B" aka best of both worlds which is half onion rings half fries. The fries were fresh hand cut and wonderfully potato-ey and the rings were nicely fired and seasoned. Overall, was dang impressed with my visit and I am shocked by all of the negative reviews.

So simple yet so delicious, stopped in and needed a quick lunch. The service was fast and friendly and the food was damn tasty. Señor Taco appears to be a 7 unit chain in the Phoenix area but dang if I could find a website linking the places. Ordered a Carne Asada soft taco and chicken hard shell taco. The beef is sourced from Black Canyon and is on point. They are very generous with the beef and the guacamole was a welcome addition. The guacamole, carne Asada and pico de gallo had such flavor that I only added a little of the Diablo sauce for contrast. I really could eat this taco every day of my life and I will have to reach out to Phillip T. of Las Vegas to get the attorney he used to file against Ace Donuts if these folks try to put up shop in Sacramento. The chicken taco was good. The chicken was cooked in a red sauce that was more wet than tasty. Amazingly, the hard shell held form. The sauce was so wet it marred the other flavors. I asked the server what type of shredded cheese they used on the taco and she said mozzarella. For all I knew it could have been Brie. Anyways the carne Asada taco was a 6 and the chicken taco was a 3. Señor Taco stay out of Sacramento or there will be trouble.
