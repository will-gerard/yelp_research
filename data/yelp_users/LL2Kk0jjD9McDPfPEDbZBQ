The food and service here is as good as any chain restaurant. What I really wanted to yelp about is, that I was there last night with my 81 year old mom in a wheel chair. The restaurant is not designed to accommodated handicapped people.  The tables are too close together and we were bumping into chairs as we proceeded to and from our table.  The bathrooms have heavy doors that are not handicap friendly.  Mom was not able to independently open the two doors to enter and exit the restrooms. It is a shame that my mother (who likes the Red Lobster food) will no longer be eating at THIS location!

Good food with big enough portions to share with your date! Tables a little too close for my taste but it's a small place.  The service was timed out perfectly but the staff could use some more training in greeting their customers!

I don't believe that I can go longer than one week without this place.  I love the fresh salad choices!  Also the selection of delicious soups, bread and deserts.  If all I was rating was the quality of the food, I would give it 5 Stars. However, it is no different than any other buffet when it comes to hunting for clean dry plates. You still have to periodically inspect 2 or 3 plates that are wet and have food stuck to them. Given the choice between Souper Salad and Sweet Tomatoes... The winner is Sweet Tomatoes by a mile!

The restaurant is beautiful and the service is just OK.  The food is nothing special and I don't see any reason to choose this restaurant again.

We found this company by yelping for a mechanic in the area that we broke down in.  I read their reviews, called them & had them tow our vehicle to his shop & do the repair. They got right on the job and I paid what I was quoted.  Very professional & I will keep their name & number for future services, even though they are not located in our neighborhood.

The food served at this establishment is fair at best,  I am not giving this place a good review except for the following... They sell a selection of home made pies that is out of this world!!!  Chocolate Cream, Peanut butter, Coconut Cream, etc.  Believe me, you won't find better pie anywhere! They would be better off shutting down the restaurant and opening up as a bakery! There is a server there named Kelly! Someone that owns a really good restaurant should try to snap her up, as she is an excellent server with an awesome personality, a big smile, remembers your name and what you order!  Very skilled at her job!

Absolutely loved this place! Good food, good service and they gave us another free full dinner for each of us to take home. Prices were surprisingly reasonable too!  Looking forward to a repeat performance real soon!

After recommending this car wash to everyone for years now, I am sorry to say that I was treated like crap by the heavyset girl at the register.  My wife & I brought both our cars for a wash & oil change.  When we tried to pay, we said that we will be paying some on one card & some on another card. The girl got mad & said we cant do that. I said, why not & she got very stern & rude and said we just dont split up bills, they wrote it up on one ticket & that is the way it is. I asked her why she is being so rude? She answered,That's the way I talk I cant slow it down for you any more than the way I talk. With the help of a manager we paid & will never return!

Love this place!  I am in here once per week buying organic fruit, seeds and nuts.  They also have the best chicken breasts ever (big and firm, just the way i like them) :)

Love the food.  Always clean and for the most part has friendly service. The music is strangely weird at times and much too loud.

We have never been to a show here before but we went last night for dinner and to enjoy the Rod Stewart show followed by the Rolling Stones! Rod was good and the Stones were awesome! The food was better than expected & food prices were reasonable. All seats are good seats at this place! Will be coming back for sure!!!

VIP Grooming is the best at what they do because the owner Tonya is so dedicated to her work.  She is a real animal lover and has a beautiful heart.  I love dogs! I have 3 now and two of them are rescue dogs.  I know that they are getting the best of care at VIP.  Thank you Tonya and staff! Bob M

I hired Top of the Hill Electrical services since a friend had them out to his house and said they were reasonable and did their job well.  They showed up a few minutes early and Keith and Chris got right to work.  They installed a large TV stand in the wall of my Master Bedroom, hung the 48 inch TV, installed a new outlet & cable receptacle up high behind the TV.  They did a great job! I felt that they respected my home and furnishings. I will definitely call them again!   :)

They do a great job. Always show up when they're suppose to.  My pool water looks clean & clear.  Very fair prices.  Very friendly & professional.  I always recommend their services to all pool owners in our neighborhood.

This establishment has given me the best service I have ever received in my 57 year life!  It combines professional high tech services with backyard mechanic thinking. Two other mechanics located closer to where I live & work looked at my van & said they couldn't get a computer code reading that tells them what needs to be repaired.  Joe at Gearhead agreed to spend some time with my van to see if he could help. I received a number of updates throughout the day advising me of his progress. Then he sent me pictures on my iPhone showing me the problem. Joe ordered the parts & in a couple days, my van was running like new!  They were very fair priced & honest. I felt comfortable from start to finish that I was in good hands with Geargead.  They are located a half hour drive from where u live, but they are worth it!

No way will I return here. Underwhelmed right from the start. Mumbling order taker that sounded like she needed to take a nap.  My wife order her sandwich with no tomato, but it had tomato on it. I had salad with chicken, but there was only 3 slivers of chicken. The food was bland.  The only reason for the 2nd star was because the place was clean. I give this place 6 months before it closes. It's more like a sandwich shop than a deli.

Hired them first to spread rock in my back yard.  They were hard working & got the job done.   I gave them a shot at maintaining all of my grass, shrubs & trees.  They did an awesome job!  Now, they are my on going landscapers every other week.  They have proven to be reliable & consistent.  I recommend  Gus & his crew to anyone seeking a fair & honest Landscape maintenance company.
