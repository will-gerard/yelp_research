I have been to this place dozens of times, even way before I started Yelping and checking in to places. It stands out among the other sushi offerings in the valley because it has, in my opinion,  - The most generous sushi portions you can find in Scottsdale and the Valley. The cuts are amazing, fresh, and expertly prepared. You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care. It is the freshest, loveliest fish you can imagine.  - Really, really good rice, all the time. Sushi rice is tricky. Sakana's rice is just sticky enough to be cohesive, but each grain is distinct from its neighbor, sitting like little oblong pearls. Sakana's rolls are wrapped rice-side out, which I feel makes it a much lovelier experience than rice-side in, as the outer rice is not unnecessarily compressed.   - Lovely service, at the bar and at the table. I see the same core staff and smiling faces that have been there for several years, and they are happy. You can't fake happy for that long! Even though the restaurant is usually full, the wait for a table is never excessive and, once you're seated, the service is prompt and friendly.  - Good prices. You'll spend 25% less on sushi / sashimi and 40% less on beer and sake here than you will at Stingray, Sushi Brokers, Sapporo, and most other sushi places around. It's actually a great bargain for the quality you get - and that is just the regular menu. I also enjoy the Happy Hour roll specials on weekdays, as well as the $1.50 appetizer add-on to an order of Kirin beer. Ask for your "I Love Sakana" card to take advantage of the loyalty program. Check in with Yelp and get your bowl of edamame! You can eat like a king, and not pay a king's ransom... so you can come back next weekend and do it all over again.

I've eaten here 5 times or so, the last few times because friends picked it and I went along. The last visit was because we decided to give it a try. The food is okay, and the Margaritas are surprisingly inconsistent - sometimes great, sometimes tasting of strong sours mix.  I really wish hygiene were more of a priority. On my last visit, we were greeted by a courteous young lady who sat us down at a booth. That booth, however, had sticky seats and table. And it wasn't the type of stickiness that comes from forgetting to clean a table... nay, it was that stickiness of a table, seat and menus diligently wiped down with a dubious rag, thus homogenizing the film of subtle but persistent stick factor over all these things. Perhaps I was being too squeamish. I wanted to like this place, to reassure myself that it was still okay to eat here: I put the menu down and picked up the plates in the table setting to inspect them... and there was stickiness on those too, along with dried food stuck on one of them. At that point, my wife and I decided to not eat here, and started heading out. The hostess asked us why we wouldn't stay and I discreetly told her and showed her. She agreed that it was terrible and sought to make things better, even offered to give us a soft drink on the house to go, but we declined and thanked her.  Since I am the king of not letting go, I will probably give Arriba's another try in the future. I urge you to give them another chance as well, although it's hard to justify with so many interesting places to eat in the area.  And sadly, I must say that the same pervasive stickiness was found in all my visits, but I kept overlooking it, and I kept coming back to meet up with friends. Well, now I suggest an alternate spot.  This is a great location and a substantial investment. I really hope management turns this around... it could really be great, but it is such a missed opportunity.

I've been a patient for a good 10 years, and I must say it's a pleasure coming here. For a visit to the dentist to be enjoyable, that's a pretty tall order!. I have also had had to try other dentists because my insurance changed for a couple of years, and it was during that time that I realized how rare a great experience at the dentist is.  For starters, a dental cleaning here is thorough and actually relaxing. It takes a good 40 minutes or so. In contrast, I've had 'express' cleanings of 20 minutes at other dentists and trust me, you don't want those.  The staff is friendly and very attentive, and Dr. Barnes is always very accessible. Through the years, my parents have a couple of tooth emergencies, sometimes over the weekend, and Dr. Barnes opened the office just to see them. I also see that another reviewer commented on Dr. Barnes fixing his teeth after hours, and that's just how Dr. Barnes is, a great dentist and an all around good guy.  In Scottsdale, dentists tend to push the high margin cosmetic dentistry items as a virtual medical necessity, but not here. Dr. Barnes offers cosmetic dentistry, but you have to ask for it and you'll never get a sales pitch - just a straightforward presentation of the benefits. And again, you have to ask.  Pros: - Ease of scheduling - they remember your name! - Office runs on time; you'll never be stuck in the waiting room for a half hour like at some other places - Dentist explains everything so you never leave with unanswered questions - You always feel like the best interest of the patient is respected  Cons: - I really can't think of any, especially since the office has had a major technological and cosmetic upgrade in the past year or so.  If you're looking for a great dentist for your family, give Dr. Barnes a call. Highly recommended!

We live in Eagle Mountain, so this Fry's is right next to our house. The things I love about it are:  - good value, meaning good prices and decent quality. - very friendly customer service. I'm not sure why some reviewers here had a negative experience, but I always have had a positive experience, and I come here a few times a week. I come here with a smile, and I get a smile back. You attract what you project! - there is a Walgreens pharmacy in it, and you get very warm, personalized service there, too. - you get Fry's points, which saves you $.10 off per gallon of gas at shell stations for every hundred dollars you spend in groceries, or at the pharmacy. - there is a mini organic market section next to the door, which has a lot of what you might find in Sprouts or Whole Foods, all in one place. It's like a mini convenience store within the larger store. Sometimes you can find exactly what you need right in that area, and be in and out. - "nobody leaves the deli without a full belly" according to Ken. You will get samples at the deli, and stuff is so delicious you will take some home. - free Wi-Fi, just in case you need it. Cellular service is spotty in the mountains, but you can get a FaceTime call going using their Wi-FI. - it has the most amazing view and sunsets, seriously!!  So when you're in the area, or if you live in the area, check it out!

The spring on my tenants' garage door snapped on Wednesday after 5:00 p.m. I called Smokey's Garage Door and left voicemail after business hours. They promptly returned the voicemail at 8:40 a.m. the next day (Thursday), and quoted me $75 for the service call and 2 x $75 for each spring, so I was looking at $230. I called one of their worthy competitors and was quoted $80 for the service call and $99 per spring, so I went with Smokey's service.  We set the appointment for that same Thursday, and I was given a window of 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. As promised, Brian Gross, the technician, called me at 2:30 p.m. and was here 20 minutes later. He was very professional and thorough, replacing everything in about 30 minutes, and oiling the hinges on the garage door as well.  It turns out I needed only one $75 spring, but I also needed two new cables at $20 each. One original cable had snapped and had to be replaced, and the other was replaced as a precaution, as it was showing signs of material fatigue. So my total bill for the repair came to $205.  I also bought a universal remote for $39.95 more, since I needed a spare one and Brian programmed it as well. I was told there would be a $10 discount applied to the service charge, but I don't see it on my bill - to be honest, I forgot about it and I think Brian did as well in good faith. EDIT: Amazingly enough, Smokey's saw my review, called me, and kindly credited the $10 to my card. It was totally an oversight on my part, too, and the fact that they made it right when they didn't have to made this experience that much more positive.   TIP: There is a 3-year warranty on springs, 1 year on cables, 30 day on labor. Save your receipt because, although the company could easily search its customer database and honor a warranty, they want to see the receipt. Also, if you sell your house, it doesn't transfer. I am giving them 5 stars but I will amend the review if I encounter issues.  All things considered, this was a very good experience. It allowed me to get my tenant's issue resolved quickly and professionally. I would use again and recommend them.

My mother has had a Swarovski bracelet for some years, which she bought for about $250, and the clasp broke. She took it to the Swarovski store, and they sent it off to the factory for lifetime warranty repair. The following month we called the store to inquire about the bracelet. Surprisingly, the store has no way to track what was sent for repair  to the factory. We were assured, however, that it was a good sign that we didn't get a call. Three months later on my mom's birthday, we received it in the mail with the following letter:  "Dear Swarovski Enthusiast -  Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate your Swarovski repair. Unfortunately, we are unable to restore your design to its original sparkling condition.  We assure you that this is a rare occurrence and hope that you will remain a Swarovski enthusiast.  Sparkling regards, Swarovski Sparkle Center"  If you buy an expensive piece and it breaks, good luck.

This place has an amazing selection of difficult to find beers and spirits. It has the largest Belgian beer selection of any establishment I've been to outside of Belgium... and some Belgian bars don't even stock that many. The place is moderately priced and it is a terrific value for what you get: Excellent service, top quality products, a terrific humidor that is worth touring, and a friendly atmosphere that is both refined and not stilted or pretentious. I'd give it five stars if it had better ventilation; I'm one of those non-smokers that will occasionally enjoy a cigar with friends. More avid smokers probably will not mind that aspect and, come to think of it, I overlook it as well because it has many other things going for it. Overall, very good and very special place.

This is a wonderful place to study, and WiFi internet access is good and fast. It is also open on Sundays, which is a huge plus. The librarians here have always been extremely helpful and friendly.  I do love it here, and enjoy the culture passes, the online resources, and music / DVDs. It is an amazing place and it is free to all. The views from the windows of the desert and occasional rabbits and birds are a relaxing complement to your reading / studying. I'm very thankful to have these great resources close to my home.  There are many free events and classes, as well as auditoriums and meeting rooms that can be rented for a nominal fee. Our HOA has had meetings booked at the library and we've always had a good experience.  There is one puzzling thing that happens here around closing time: the staff will switch the lights on and off rapidly while making the announcement that the library is about to close. This is done with hundreds of fluorescent lights, significantly shortening their life and consuming energy. I wish they would stop doing this :-)

This place has great yogurt. I enjoy the more gelato-like flavors such as Chocolate and Peanut Butter, Strawberry Shake, Caramel, and Oatmeal Cookie. Those really shine here. Sorbet-like mixes such as Pomegranate provide a nice and welcome contrast. Since I don't like tart flavors, I can't speak to those. Also, the yogurt is more dense here than at other places, giving it the consistency of gelato: less air whipped in = more goodness.  A staff member MUST assist you with trying different flavors; I am told this is for hygiene reasons. Since most yogurt places allow you to sample flavors yourself, the policy must be explained to newcomers. A friendly sign explaining this would be nice.  The toppings bar is diligently stocked with a wide variety of goodies, all the time. Are you tempted? Here are 2 things you need to know if you want to be a regular:   - Loyalty discount! Buy 8 cups of yogurt, and get a $3.00 discount. Tell them to set you up on the system, and give your last name every time you buy yogurt. Now, you will have to remind them EVERY time you buy yogurt, or you will not get it! Sadly, they will not ask. I learned that the hard way, and missed out on credit for 8+ cups of yogurt.   - Groupon! For $15, you get 5 $6 vouchers, giving you $30 worth of purchasing power here. You must use them in $6 increments, so plan accordingly.   Have fun!  Edit: I removed the $.35 Tuesday, as this promotion is no longer happening. bring it baaaack!!

My wife and I visited this place Friday night, arriving at 8:30.  THE GOOD:  The 2 Spicy Tuna Rolls & 1 Spicy Salmon Roll were delicious. They had a hint of sesame oil that went very well with the spices. Portion size was adequate but not particularly generous as you may find in Sakana.  The 2 Salmon Sashimi & 1 Tuna Sashimi were also delicious; the fish was very fresh and the wasabi used here is better than at most places. Portion size was smallish for the Sashimi but the quality was good.  Sake bombers (Hot Sake & 22 fl. oz bottle of Kirin or Kirin Light) are great at $5.  They offer takeout and the service is friendly. There is also a $25 Restaurant.com dining certificate you can purchase for $3 to $10 (depending on the promotion Restaurant.com may be running). With our bill of $54 excluding tax & tip, it worked out to $46 or so including tax and tip after the certificate.   THE BAD: Ambiance is lacking. The kitchen is open to the dining room and there is the constant hum of kitchen extractor fans and a pungent smell of deep fryer due for an oil change. The fryer smell was very annoying, and I smelled like it after I got home. When I go to Quizno's I expect to smell like burnt cheese, and when I visit the cafeteria griddle I expect to smell like a tater tot.... I don't expect it here.  The floors were dirty, as might happen when mopping without changing water. The table was sticky, as might happen if using the same rag to 'go over' a table and call it clean. We told our waitress that the table was sticky right after we had sat down with our menus; she was super nice and moved us to another table that was less sticky but still had that film. We thanked her.  CONCLUSION: I might give this place a try further down the road, with a $25 certificate and if I'm allowed to sit outside and brave the elements. Had I paid full price for this meal, I would be upset. You can go to Sakana and get a better deal in terms of quality, quantity and ambiance. But maybe the Chinese fusion side is something really special in this restaurant and I just didn't try it.. Okay, I might try a Chinese dish next time... to go.

Discomfort Inn  The property is well kept, the landscaping is nice, the pool is sparkling clean, and so was the spa. The room and bathroom was also very clean and nice, and the free WiFi is a nice touch. However, I am giving it two stars because the management sees fit to turn up the thermostat for the hallways and elevator area, and it was a sweltering 94 degrees Fahrenheit in the hallway at midnight. It was actually hotter inside than it was outside, and somebody had propped the door to the parking lot with a large ashtray to let a breeze in, defeating the card authentication mechanism to get inside the property. I took a picture of the thermostat and posted it here. The elevator felt even hotter than that, but I can't prove it. I know energy is expensive, but you can't run a place like that.  The people at the front desk apologized and said that many had complained and the issue had been raised before, but the hot hallways were management's policy and that unfortunately there was nothing they could do, adding that the policy "is killing the housekeeping staff."  Again, the property is great, and it would be much more welcoming if the air conditioning was left on during the Phoenix summers.

The service is really great - no contracts, just a rock-solid commitment to having no pests in your home. And we are happy to stay for the long haul with such a great company and responsiveness to our calls. Bulwark has been servicing our property since my wife was pregnant and now we have a healthy 3-month-old baby, so friendly chemicals and expert application was a big thing for us. Pam McCubbin, our tech, is just awesome; she is super knowledgeable and a joy to see every month. We went from having a bad scorpion and ant infestation, to no activity.  Highly recommended!

If you have a question, and are fortunate to live in Fountain Hills, don't waste your time with the national USPS hotline. Give them a call at +1 (480) 837-4812! The lady I spoke with today was incredibly helpful, sweet, professional - A breath of fresh air. There was zero hold time! She picked up on the first or second ring! That is unheard of these days.  I've also had to go in to mail packages. Although the lines can be long, service was patient and courteous. Yes, you might have to wait in line, but you might actually meet a stranger who brightens your day.  Try calling!

This is a great place! A group of us went there for brunch. Did you know that champagne is complimentary?? That provided for a very memorable and special start to the weekend. The food and service was very good, as was the ambiance and beautiful natural surroundings of the area.  It is a bit far from our usual stomping grounds in North Scottsdale, but the drive is relaxing and the place is worth the trip. We will be back!
