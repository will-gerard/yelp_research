One of our favorite neighborhood sushi restaurants. The food is really fresh and the sushi chefs are always friendly and chatty! We go at least once a month. And choose Sushiya over the other two sushi restaurants that are much closer. Get the geisha! It's our favorite!

Horrible service! I walked in with two bags and which I literally just took off hangers at my home and put into bags for easy transfer. Everything was clean and not even wrinkled. When I got there they said they probably wouldn't take anything because they are NOT on hangars. But said they would look through. Not even 5 minutes later they call my name and tell me that they won't take them because they aren't on hangers. But asked if I would like to donate them. Are you kidding me! I brought in purses and all name brand merchandise, of course they want me to "donate it" so they don't have to give me any money or credit. Such a scam and horrible service! Very disappointed.

Such fun restaurant to go with a group of people. They have local beers on tap and the service staff have a fun almost chill service approach. Just a enjoyable laid back joint with some good seafood and a casual environment. I can't stress how casual it is, be prepared to wear a bib if you will be cracking crabs and eating with your hands! :)
