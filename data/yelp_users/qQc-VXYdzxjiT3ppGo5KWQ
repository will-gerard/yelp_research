Very disappointed!!! Wings are my and my lil man's favorite food. I called up like I usually do and put my order in. We'll when I asked to put 6 plain wings on the side it was a BFD! The owner Sam even called me a liar.#BESTFOODHORRIBLESERVICE

The food was amazing and nicely proportioned, but the service was horrible. Right when we walked in, no greetings and we were ignored. I had to approach the host and tell him how many were in our party. Then my family and I got an attitude from a few employees. They were very rude  and had horrible attitudes. It was so bad that my 7yr old asked whats wrong with them. I  understand if someone has a bad day. But customers should NEVER FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE!!!

Horrible service! I'm in line and when it's my turn to get my loan, I'm told oh I'm going to take another customer who had just pulled up. Strike one, then Tina the manager, BTW Horrible Customer Service tells me she can't help me even though all my stuff is on file. Strike 2 then after a few minutes of them trying to get their heads out of their burrs I'm told oh you need to go to the location on RAY rd. STRIKE 3 I'M A LOYAL ALWAYS PAYING ON TIME NEVER LATE CUSTOMER. I'VE DONE AT LEAST 20 DIFFERENT LOANS WITH THE COMPANY!  HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!
