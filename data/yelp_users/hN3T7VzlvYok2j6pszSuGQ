I've been coming here for years. The food is quite good, although I'm not much into the fancy foods. They used to do a crepe buffet at their Sunday brunch which I loved (not sure if they do it anymore). But overall, the experience and food here is pretty great. Nice to sit out on the patio as well.

Family owned and a great place! They have several leagues for people to play in and of course my favorite, the batting cages. Staff is super friendly. Love this place!

Not all Samurai Sams are created equal! This one is the best by far. I have been going here for over 10 years and something about this location is just better tasting and better quality than the others.

I may be an adult now, but this is and always has been my favorite pizza!! Some people hate it, but I think it's absolutely the best pizza. :)

Where do I begin? This store has a HUGE banner outside of their story. (Like, the size of a semi-truck huge) that says "We Match Online Prices". Oddly enough, they don't match THEIR OWN online prices.   My boyfriend went in to buy a camera (which they didn't have in stock) and it was selling for about $114 in the store. The only one they had left was the demo. You know, the one that hundreds of people have thrown around as a toy for the past year? Yeah that one. We asked if we could buy that one. They said sure, and they would even take off 5% from the $114!   Are you kidding me? That's insulting. So basically we would be paying MORE for a used camera than if we went on FRY'S website to buy a brand new one. They claimed that Sony wouldn't allow them to do any more than 10%, but after bartering for a bit, they miraculously did. 10% off their in store price (still not matching their online price...). We finally agreed because it would be cheaper than we could get it anywhere else.   We purchased the camera, went home and plugged it into the charger, and it didn't even turn on. The camera didn't work at all!  We ended up trying for about an hour before deciding to go back. On our way, we popped into Best Buy. We told them what happened and they HAPPILY and without even hardly asking, matched the price of the used camera and gave us a brand new one. We were in and out in about 10 minutes.   We returned the broken camera to Fry's and will surely NEVER go back. I'm surprised nobody has sued them for a misleading sign on their building....It should really say " We match online prices, except for our own."

No doubt, the best gym on the planet. I worked here for a few years and still come to the gym anytime I'm in town. No gym I've ever been at even compares. This place rocks!!!

I worked here when they first opened and would eat their food on my break every day. Now about 4 or 5 years later, whenever I'm in town I MUST make a stop. Filet Mignon cobb salad and the white chocolate brownie are my go-to's, but the tortilla soup. the french dip, the turkey dip, just EVERYTHING is amazing. Wish there was one in Santa Monica, but then again I'd be broke and overweight if there was...

Perfect breakfast place to chill out on the patio. Nice and quiet with a great menu. Definitely try the sweet potato tater tots :)
