Anytime I can get out of the office to get lunch, I go to Zoe's.  Great array of fresh and mostly healthy meals.  LOVE the chicken salad and the (not so healthy) chocolate cake.  Staff are friendly, service is quick, food is consistent which is the best recipe for an successful work lunch.

Thank you to the Orion team.  Joe was fantastic to work with from the beginning and helped me more than he knows.  His team is great to work with and explains everything that needs to be done.  With much sincerity and gratitude, I  highly recommend Orion for your mortgage and refinancing needs.

First time we went, we loved our breakfast sandwiches.  We couldn't wait to go back. Just went today. Not super busy when we got there. It's a beautiful Sunday morning. Walk in. They are out of breakfast menus and the kid behind the counter said he doesn't know the menu and can't help until the owner gets back from printing the menu. They are also out of coffee but he assured us he's making some. He over charges us for our meal and then helps the other customers before refunding us.  Now the coffee is ready and  it comes out a light shade of pale. Send that back. Waiting entirely too long now for our food and was told everything is made to order. Well it's bacon and eggs so I would hope so.  Asked for a refund. Owner passive aggressively tells us to have a blessed and wonderful day and we left.  Great concept. Bread is amazing but they really need to get their act together   Won't be back on a Sunday again that's for sure.

Happened upon this place by accident.  It's tucked away in a strip mall and is hard to see from the road. But OMG this place has great food.  I was happy right away when I walked in to see how clean this place is.  The people were friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Chicken Fajita (Middle Eastern Style) and have never tasted anything so good.  I got mine without the Pita but my husband got his with and loved it.  Ive been there three times now even though we live and work on the other side of town.  Will go back again as a special treat.  Seems like there a quite of few regulars there and it's like a neighborhood meeting spot.  Loved it!  Highly recommend :)

We decided to have dinner at the Persian Room.  When ordering, we substituted the rice that comes with the meal for a different type of rice.  The waitress had suggested that I substitute half my rice for small Greek salad. The meal came, the portions were huge and the food was good (not great).  We had to ask several times for refills on our hot tea.  When the bill came we noticed that there was a $10 up charge for the substitutions. I mentioned this to the waitress and she said that she can see my point too (huh?) and would talk to the manager.  She came back to say that he would not take the up charges off because it was written on the menu that there's a charge. I asked to speak with him. His name is Mike.  I told him that the waitress had offered the rice/salad substitution and never said a word about the extra charges and didn't appreciate the up charges and he stated " this is a fine dining establishment and we don't like to insult our customers by telling them about $2-$3 up charges here and there.". I told him that he just insulted me that he assumed I don't know how fine dining works.  He said he would reverse the charges but "next time..." I told him there would be no next time.  He ultimately reversed the $10 in up charges. Oh and we never did get our refill on our tea....

Been going to this salon for almost 8 years with a few times trying other salons.  I keep coming back because it's clean and they are consistent and fair. Holly the owner, is always so friendly and seems to really care.  Lee does my nails and is fast and proficient and Jessica is my back up person if Lee isn't available.  Jessica also does my eye brows and does a great job.  This husband and wife team really care about their customers and it shows.

Our go to place for when we want a nice dinner and feel like being pampered a bit. Great menu, nice drinks and always top notch service.  Do your self a favor, have lunch on their patio on a beautiful day over looking the patio or on a gorgeous evening on the patio.  You will love it. The prices are just a tad high for us to go often but 100% worth every penny.  Make reservations for the weekends because there is usually a wait. Love this place.

Lovely little spot downtown.  Very nice services and adorable building.  Love the outdoor patio   While I so appreciate the fact that they have Gluten Free Pizza (so hard to find) the crust is so salty that it's almost not edible.  I've tried it twice to make sure it wasn't a one time mistake.  I WILL go back again but will opt for a salad next time.

This was our second trip to Chelsea's.   all we can say is YUMMM!     Husband had the Short Rib Tacos and I had the Chicken Mole Tacos.  Both are served with a nice helping of guacamole and a fabulous Kale Salad.    We sat on the patio. ( do it before it gets too hot!  Totally worth the wait!).  We had a pitcher of Sangria which we think is a great price for $21.  It seems to be their signature drink.  There was a pitcher on practically everyone's table.   The service was top notch and it ran like a well oiled machine.    And then....there was...the....Red Velvet cake.  Like no other....  Don't leave there without trying it.

We love Blue Agave.  The food is fresh, service is good.  My fiancés favorite meal was the steak on top of the garlic mashed potatoes but unfortunately they recently changed their menu which I was not as impressed with. Their happy hour menu is great with plenty of choices.  Even though the menu changed, we will continue to eat there...we still love it.

What a loss for our area!  Kashman's has closed.  We drove there for our weekly Sunday breakfast and was stunned to see a sign on the door and that it was closed!  So we drove south to the other location to discover that was closed as well!  UGH! They were the best and I know their closing will make a lot of people sad.  Good luck to the owners and you will be missed!

Oh Chompies!!  Almost like having Grandma Esther back with us.  The food is  consistent, authentic and delicious.  We eat breakfast there as well as dinner on a regular basis. They have great gluten free items, clearly marked if that's relevant to you.  The portions are generous and wait staff is good.   Oh and check out the bakery.  It's beautifully displayed with an incredible selection.

Went for Restaurant Week and ordered from the pre fixed menu.  We were greeted when we walked in and checked on often by Chef Eddie. The food was phenomenal. We decided this is our new favorite place!  The ambiance was great as was the service. A little pricey to eat there often but we will be back for sure. Thanks Eddie!

Food and service was fabulous.  We sat at the teppanyaki table and all was great except that they had this awful singer on the stage and couldn't even hear what the teppanyaki chef was saying which is part of the fun of going out for teppanyaki!!   I really hope that the owner reconsiders having live entertainment.  I am one that usually loves live entertainment but the Japanese experience and this loud  live folk singer just didn't mix at all :-/

After eating there the first time right after they opened, I thought I would give them another try to see if they worked out the kinks.  Boy am I glad I did!  The service was so much better.  The breakfast was excellent ( you've GOT to try the pancakes)!  We are now a fan and will make this our new Sunday place to go since Kashman's has closed.   LOVE IT!

We love having Babbos in our neighborhood in Tatum Ranch.  The food is consistent....great bread!  The Buffalo Chicken Salad is my favorite.  At times, the service can be a bit inconsistent.  I love their take out service.  Great little pizzas as well.  A must try if you're in the Tatum Ranch area or even just being in North Phoenix might be worth the drive.

The food is beyond good here....always fresh, perfectly seasoned and cooked. It's always clean even at the height of the busy time.  Only two draw backs are is that it's slightly pricey and there needs to be more choices of side dishes.  Other than that it's a fabulous little place and worth the drive from anywhere.

Great girls night out place.  Wine selection was extensive and we DEVOURED the Bruschetta!  Try to get there for the Happy Hour prices or you will be paying a minimum of $9 per glass of wine.   One of my new fave places :)

Not a lot of choices in Cave Creek so we keep trying this one over and over again expecting a different result (isnt' that the definition of insanity???) My husband enjoys the all you can eat fish and chips on Fridays.  Problem is, the service is so slow that there is no way you have all you can eat because it takes forever between orders.  Then there's the problem with asking for refills on your beer because that, too will never come.   Finally, last night was the last straw.  My husband ordered the hamburger with fries and I ordered the Caesar Salad.  The waitress put my husband's lovely burger in front of him (albeit a bit skimpy on the fries)  and then put three or four leaves of lettuce in front of me.  I ask " Is this the caesar?"  She said yes.  I said "is this a side salad?"  She said yes.  I asked "if my husband is ordering dinner, did you think maybe I would like dinner too and not a side salad?"  She apologized and assured me she would bring me the real salad (with chicken and full sized) within five minutes.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked to see the manager who admitted they were having troubles with staff and that if we had sat in the bar area, we would have better service.  Good to know HOWEVER, as soon as she walked away, my husband spotted a MOUSE running across the dining room and we were now done. Never will we walk in there again. Now I know they are in the desert and have a large back door to the patio leaving them probably more vulnerable to creepy crawlies but I , for sure, cannot see one reason to ever step foot into that place again.  I do hope they get their act together one day.

I, like many others, discovered Divine Skin Spa through Groupon.  From that visit on, I was hooked.  I am not usually the type of person who is easily swayed by things but after my facial, I quickly inquired about the membership they offer (they DID NOT push this on me, I inquired).  What a fabulous deal.    For $39 per month (it may have gone up to $49 now but still...) you get a choice of a signature facial (heavenly), a massage or a body treatment.  There are no contracts and you can cancel anytime with no notice.  Also, if you don't use a service one month, it accumulates for the next month.  They also have awesome weekly specials via email.  The spa is very pretty, the services are great and the owner, Nichole is very helpful.  If you've always wanted to get  facials on a regular basis ( or even occasional facials) but was not able to fit it into your budget, this is your place AND the quality of the facial (and I've had MANY) is superb!  Highly recommend!

We love Zaytoons and eat there often.  The food is good and consistent. Not a huge fan of the set up style of the place (order at the counter) but it's always clean and the staff is friendly. Our favorite is what we call Pomegranite Chicken Saturday which is the special of the day on saturdays.  It's delicious!  The food is authentic middle eastern food.

What a beautiful store!!  I have been a fan of Just Jane for a long time and I am so happy they now have the exposure of a store front.  The handbag and accessory selection is beautiful and now they are starting to carry unique boutique type clothing In all sizes.  I wish them lots of luck in their new location and look forward to many more trips to Just Jane Boutique.

Great new place near Desert Ridge! You've gotta try it! And for all those who are  environmentally aware  they are all organic, locally grown and don't even have paper towels in the bathroom. They even have an extensive gluten free menu. Breakfast/lunch/dinner.  TRY THE SWEET POTATO TOTS, the fresh squeezed (while you wait) Orange Juice and the Creme Brule ....OMG!  Will go back over and over again!  Great place :)

Our favorite little go to spot.  My fiancé and I usually go to Upper Crust at least one to two  times per week.  We now have our "own" booth and the waitress know us well. In other words, we are always made to feel special there.  We always get the Ceasar Salad and a large pizza with feta cheese on it...extra crispy please!  We thank you, Upper Crust for your existence and to the great wait staff!

I love SPOONZ.  I go there several times per week and always get the same personally crafted tuna salad.  The prices are reasonable.  The sweets in the display are beautifully made right there on site by a pastry chef who trained in Europe.  The food is fresh, fast and tasty.  The service is no nonsense which I like.  Give SPOONZ a chance if you're ever downtown.

All I can say is never again....the atmosphere is dark, gray and dingy. There is a loud humming noise that comes out of the kitchen which is smack, dab in the middle of the place....theres really no quiet place to sit.  I must say, the cheese ravioli was excellent but the pizza was not edible to our standards...it was soggy (we had ask for extra crispy) and everything fell off the pizza while eating it.   I only could eat one slice..it was that bad.  The waitress was slow but friendly.  She forgot our refills of bread after asking several times. I am all for supporting the mom and pop places but this needs work.  It was really gross watching a kitchen staff member with long fake polished finger nails putting the silverware away grabbing them from the tops, not the handles.   A little hidden surprise was the adorable outside patio that I wish were had seen (or even offered) upon arrival.  It may have made sitting there so long and the bad pizza a little more enjoyable.

We love the Grotto. Love the breakfast bowls and they make a great cup of java. On a nice day, the patio is a lovely place to dine. The decorations on the inside are retro and fun. Definitely would like to try it for lunch sometime.  Nice place and worth the drive

We were so excited when this location opened.  Finally!  An Einsteins in our little Cave Creek!  Despite the fact I am giving them two stars, we do go there often because, well it's Cave Creek and selection is low.  The food is good but so often, they have run out of a certain bagel or muffin or something else on a Sunday morning as if, *shock* they may actually be busy on a Sunday morning!  But the absolute worse thing is the fact that, not one time, nope, never have they once gotten our to go order right.  I have to double check every order now and they always have to redo it.  One time, I was at the coffee bar filling my coffee when one of the girls was trying to get passed me so I let her through. I was the only one at the coffee bar but she chose THAT exact moment to remove all of the creamers without as much as an explanation. When I asked another girl, she replied "oh we must refill them every (however often)". BUT I AM STANDING RIGHt HERE!!  Another time, the "kids" were all doing their assigned jobs but no one was cashiering. After seeing the long line to pay was getting backed up, they all looked at me in horror when I asked who will get the register.  Part of the problem is that the kids who work there, always seem distracted by one another. Not sure what to do about this.

Always looking for a new breakfast place and finally tried here.  We were really pleasantly surprised at the remodeling of the old bagel joint. It's now a really cool spot with plenty of comfortable seating. The waiter was friendly and efficient. Our breakfast came out fast, fresh and wonderful.  Great portion size, beautifully presented and delicious.  Over the moon excited that they offered gluten free bread.  It's been way too long that I've enjoyed bread with my breakfast.  Ahhh the little things in life.  The prices were reasonable, coffee delish and always warmed up and we can't wait to return.

Love this studio.  The instructors are patient and knowledgable. The schedule is accommodating and the classes are fantastic.  Even if you are not in great shape, you will be able to work out at your own pace and not self conscious.  The studio is clean and well equipped!  Just try it! First class is free.

Great lunch place.  For just $7.95, you can order either a build your own pizza or salad. Portions  are quite generous and delicious.  Definitely a place to go over and over again. This location gets pretty busy during the week at lunchtime but the staff is fairly efficient and can get your food done quickly.  Highly recommend

OMG. This place is fantastic. My husband can eat his weight (and then some) in sushi. For $20 per person all you care to eat, he leaves happy and satisfied.  He loves all the sashimi options. The food is cooked to order so it is not spinning around on a conveyor belt for lord knows how long.  I'm not a fish eater and find plenty of yummy options. It's clearly stated to only order what you will eat so don't complain if they try to charge you for ordering too much. What he is able to consume would cost us over $100 at other sushi places.  This place is a gem and we will continue to go there often.

We absolutely loved the entire experience of this lovely place. We had a wonderful waiter who took so much time to explain this Asian/Mexican fusion  concept that was new to us. The decor is pretty and tasteful and the atmosphere had a cool vibe.  We loved the edamame and the eggplant.  I had the sangria which was yummy. This will be our new go to place. 100% recommend.

Very friendly service, decent prices ($18 for a regular fill), very clean and pretty inside.  Owner Lynn does a great job with nails but sometimes appears distracted by what's going on around her.  Overall, a very nice neighborhood salon and worth a visit. Highly recommend!

Hubby and I really enjoyed Asados.  The decor is pretty, server was attentive, margaritas were delicious and the food was great.  Not sure what all the negativity is about.   It's definitely worth a second try for those who may have had a bad experience. Only downside was the salsa was a bit to hot for me.  Squeezed a half a lemon to cool it down and it was all good.

If heaven had a store.... Being a bit of a sweets connoisseur, I just had to try this place and it's only a five minute walk from my work which makes it entirely TOO convenient.  The only downfall is the location which is inside Chelsea's Corner and may be hard for people to find even though they have their own sign out side.   They are crunchy cake donuts which taste so fresh.  They are a little smaller than the average donut but with the yummy topping choices, I'm not sure I could eat anything bigger.  With choices like the Salted Carmel, the French Toast, Morning Buzz (Mocha Glaze with Oreo Cookie) or the Death by Chocolate (choco glaze, choco sprinkles and crushed Oreo toppings) or any other crazy combo you can come up with, all you will leave there saying is OMG and "I better take an extra walk around the block".  There are 20 different glazes with at least that many toppings to choose from.  There is also the option to get eggs and bacon on the donut but that wouldn't be my thing.   There are other locations through out the valley.  The prices are a little high but OH SO worth it.    If heaven had a store...it would have this goofy named Fractured Prune.

My new obsession.  Love healthy eating that actually has yummy choices and creative ingredient combinations.  I love the half Mona Lisa with quinoa superfood side.  Just got the Siam I Am salad tonight and it's also fabulous.  The soups are fresh and interesting.  The food is fresh.  The place is clean and the staff seem to care that you are getting a good experience.  And OH BOY is their ice tea the best I have ever had with choices like Herbal Hibiscus, Fuji Apple, Passion Fruit Mango all lightly sweetened with Stevia or honey.  They also have a juice bar that I had yet to try out.  I work right next to the one downtown and live right next to the Scottsdale location.  I feel bad for all the others who don't live near by. I give this place two massive thumbs up and you will too.

Hubby and I love going out for breakfast and since this was new to our neighborhood we decided to give it a try. The place has nice decor and the waiter was decent. What we didn't like is where the owners cut corners.  The home fry potatoes were obviously previously frozen from a bag because they were perfectly cubed, tasted bad and had a spoon full of peppers and onions randomly placed on top. I ordered a fruit side with my meal and again, was previously frozen. I understand cost and time  savings measures but this took away the quality of the meal and sorry to say, we won't be back.

Walked into this so called hospital with my dog a bloody mess from being attacked by another dog.  They immediately brought us back to be checked by a vet tech who said that he looks worse than he actually is and proceeded to put us in a room telling us that the doctor would be right with us. We were shaken up and I found myself annoyed by the talking and giggling of the staff outside the door. Our dog was fading and collapsed on the floor and we asked for a blanket. She gave us one.  After waiting quite a while, my husband and we went to the front desk and asked how much longer it will be and she said your dog is stable and that there were at least four emergencies ahead of us. We scooped up our dog and put him back in the car to take him to VetMed which is 10 mins away. When we got to VetMed, they took him right away to the back and gave him pain meds.  They got him shaved and found at least 30 puncture wounds, a broken foot, broken tooth and he was in shock.  They saved his life. Especially since he is a 15 year old dog. I would encourage this place to take a better look at its practices in its treatment of dogs and their owners.
