Allegiant Air has the absolute worst/unreasonable customer service department. I booked a flight on 4/23/13 for travel on 8/7/13.  A problem came up with my travel plans and was forced to cancel my flight the day after booking.  I spent hours trying to get into contact with Allegiant Air's customer service department but was continuously told by the automated system that call volume was too high.  I then attempted to contact them via their web based email system. They responded hours later that they could not help me and that I needed to call the same number I had been attempting to use all day to contact them.  I finally got a hold of them that evening and they said that since it was past the 24 hour period I would not be able to receive a full cash refund.  I have been battling them through my bank and have been unsuccessful in getting a cash refund.  Now I am stuck with a flight voucher that I have NO use for and I am out $339. What a frustrating nightmare.  I will NEVER fly this airline again and I will continue to use every opportunity to shy my friends and family away from this Airline.  I have never in my life experience such a disregard for reasonable action, ethics, and even the bare minimum of customer service. I hope it was worth the $339 Allegiant!!!

Highly recommend this place on Fridays for happy hour! They used to have this guy named Taylor Ouellette playing all kinds of jams in the bar area. Really wish they would bring him back. Anyways, great food, great crowd, and good vibes!
