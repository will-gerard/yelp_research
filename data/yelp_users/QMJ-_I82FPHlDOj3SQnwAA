The best hot dogs, ever!! I go here just for the hot dogs! They may be cheap but don't let that fool you. I don't know what they put in them but they are like crack. I can't get enough!!

Walked in and walked right back out. It smelled so bad like sweaty mildew. I can't even explain it. It was unbearable and I won't be back.

Easiest airport! I always get in and get out really quick and have never had an issue.

No acknowledgement for 10 min. I am literally standing at the front while I am typing this and waitresses keep walking by not even saying a word. How can you make eye contact with someone who is standing at the front of your restaurant and not say anything! It's not even busy.    .....  Finally got acknowledged. 15 minutes later. What in the world...

I was looking online for something to eat nearby me and this place had great reviews which drew me in the check out the menu. I had been craving a Margherita pizza for a while so I decided to just give them a shot and ordered the Pizza Margherita with grilled chicken. I went and picked it up and found out that Defalco's is basically half restaurant/half true Italian grocery. I have been into making homemade pizza lately so the grocery really excited me. I have decided I will come back in a couple days to pick up some of their authentic ingredients for a homemade pizza night! Anyways, I got home and the pizza was great! I love how thin the crust and the mozzarella was amazing! Great little spot that I never would have even noticed if it wasn't for Yelp

Quick and easy in and out for an oil change and they didn't try selling me other services! I will definitely be coming back for that reason. I always hated getting my oil changed because other places would always make it seem like my car is breaking down and needs this this and this done to it. Anyways, they were great and gave me a punch card for oil changes. So cool!

I was having a bad night so I decided to order some hot and sour soup, rent some movies, and just stay in that night. I looked online and the only place that had decent reviews was this place.  So, I go to their menu and I ordered my hot and sour soup. I had to order chicken fried rice and pot stickers also since my total had to be at least 15$ or something like that. But that's okay I wasn't fretting it.   Anyways, I ended up not having to wait long until my food was at the door which was great! I put the food on my table and open it all up and it smelled great. Now let me tell you I am a huge hot and sour soup fan and I know good soup from bad but this soup was hands down the best hot and sour soup I have ever had! They even put shrimp in it! The fried rice and pot stickers were just like any other restaurants.   The only negative thing I could say about this place was the fact that they gave me three fortune cookies and it was only me eating the food. So 1 it made me feel like a fatty and 2 it made me feel lonely because I was supposed to be eating that meal with 3 people. Or on the plus side I needed to open all three fortunes to find the good one and I now have a good fortune!  Will definitely we returning for some more hot and sour soup!!

I got the blended Taro tea with boba and it was so yummy! It's my go to bubble tea drink. It tastes like fruity pebbles  Next time I come in I really want to try the snow ice cream!

How do you guys not have anyone working that knows how to do acrylics? You're a nail salon! I thought with all the good reviews you would at least hire nail techs who know how to do acrylics!! Wish I could give zero stars.

The Taro tea with boba is my current obsession! I come here once a week because I can't get enough of it. The place is cool it's sort of hidden in Tempe Marketplace. They serve food as well and there's a whole bunch of empanadas on display when you walk in. I will try the food one day but for now, all I want is my Taro tea!

Layne is the best! She makes me not only feel very comfortable but she makes me look amazing! My eyebrows looked so good after the sugaring and it doesn't hurt like waxing does which I love. I will definitely be coming back for my brows and I am going to be starting a chemical peel routine with her as well!
