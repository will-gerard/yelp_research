Flying 10+ times a year on average, I couldn't do it out of any airport besides Sky Harbor.  Using terminal 4 exclusively, I've never had a wait longer than 10 minutes going through security (Flying out mainly on Friday afternoon or early Monday morning.)  Food choices are plentiful around the terminal inside and outside of security (I am disappointed Burger King doesn't have the BK Stacker there.)  People movers are a quick way to get around or you can tip the guy to drive you right to your gate.  The decor is nice and warm compared to others (SFO.)  Getting here is very easy and the Cell lot is a great place to wait for arriving passengers.  The $2 for parking is worth it sometimes just to meet people at security so you don't feel so rushed to get baggage and say hello.  All and all, good job Phoenix.

I've only been here once and I got really sick from drinking too much, but it only cost me 35 bucks.  The music was great  and the drinks vere very nicely priced.  For a dive bar, it was a great time.  Another plus is I live across the street within walking distance.

So your wife gets a flat tire and you need to get it fixed, and the dealership you work at is closed till Monday. Where are you gonna go? Well after driving around for an hour trying to find a place that's open, I found Firestone.  Chad the manager was extremely helpful in getting my tire fixed.  20 minutes and they pulled my Equinox in, got the tire off, patched it, and had me out of there without trying to upsell me on anything I didn't need.  I did check out prices on new tires and the prices weren't bad either.  Totally reccomend this place for your automotive needs if your in the neighborhood.

Who knew the Safeway deli was this good?  Got myself one of their signature sandwiches and boy was it yum.  Cobb salad on a roll basically as I've forgotten the fancy name.  In and out pretty quick, I'll be back to try another.

So, after my yearly eye exam, it turns out I needed a new pair of glasses. So I headed down to Eyemasters since it was the closest place to my house. Now, due to my large cranium, this is no easy task. Usually an all day affair, things get messy, blah blah blah. But the staff here knew exactly what to do. By some extreme miracle (or a lot of experience) they knew exactly where all the big headed frames were at. Found a pair I liked, contacted my insurance to determine coverage, special ordered my lenses, in and out in under an hour.  Customer service here is A+ and I will be back if I ever need another pair.

On a Friday night this is the perfect place to go after work for a nice drink and a quiet dinner.  I like to sit at the sushi bar where my buddy Johnny comes up with some crazy sushi combinations that are definately not on the menu but should definately be.  Reasonably priced sushi + saki bombers = a great dining experience.  I can't speak for the Teppan tables, but the show Johnny can put on is worth it.

I had the recent pleasure of purchasing a part there a couple weeks ago.  Their manager Joe was very heplful in finding what I needed (for a 79 mind you.) Very to the point but very friendly also.

This is the first pizza place where I haven't eaten the pizza. My visits usually consist of the spring salad with their made-in-house dressing and either a sandwich or pasta. Every sandwich is excellent and filling no matter which you choose.  The atmosphere is excellent with sports on in the backround and this Nello's location has the friendliest wait staff out of all of them.

This place has become a cult favorite here at my dealership.  It went from daring each other to try it to eating here twice a week for some of us.  The lunch specials here give you the most bang for the buck, and the food is pretty good too.  There's a lot of items to choose from here depending on your tastes so I recomend checking the menu on their website.  Since this is my lunch destination, I usually rotate thru the lunch specials which come with huge portions.  If your looking for something on the cheap, then try one of the three $5.85 specials which include a drink.    If your into cheap decent chinese food, give it a try.  Super friendly customer service from this family owned and run restruant.

Walking in, there was an overwhelming aroma I haven't smelt since I lived in the Bay Area. It sure smelt like home. 30+ aisles of food from around the world along with the freshest and most complete produce selection you can find. The seafood looked very fresh as a lot of it was still swimming around in the tanks.   I found my rice noodles with ease along with some frozen lumpia and a lot of veggies. The down side here is most of the staff didn't speak English, so help was a little hard to find, and the parking lot was a death trap waiting to claim it's next victim. I love this place, epically the produce, so give it a try if your into Asian cuisine. You won't be disappointed.

One of the best brownies ever. Period. And the chocolate chip cookies were awesome also.  I drove past this place since i didn't know what I was looking for.  Set in a small village looking area on the east side of the street, the building is small and well decorated.  The staff was very friendly and sweet.  The chocolate brownies tasted like they'd just been baked moments ago.  They come individually wrapped which makes it a great gift for others.  The cookies don't come wrapped but they won't last long after you take your first bite.  They do have ice cream and I was very tempted to have a sundae if everything else was that good.  I just might have to stop in this weekend.....

Had my bachelor party there and my friend's bachelor party there and it was a blast (truth be told I don't remember my bachelor party.) There are a lot of natural ladies to choose from (along with a fair share of bolt-on ladies too) and all of them were very pretty.  Haven't tried the food but I hear it's pretty good.  Reasonably priced everything for a gentleman's club, I'll be going back for whatever occasion presents itself.

I had my wedding here and I must say I didn't need a wedding planner with these guys.  Husband and wife owners and they treated my event like it was their own.  The outdoor area was big enough to handle out 100+ crowd.  Speaker system worked nice so everyone heard the whole ceremony. It was just flat out GORGOUS with the decor with the fountain and red brick and this is just the outside.  The inside was 100 time better than the outside giving it that outside cafe in Italy look.  The food was EXCELLENT all around.  Just the experience was top notch.  All the guests said we picked a great place and a couple of my friends are having their weddings there.  A lot better value than some of the other venues, more bang for the buck.

I can't believe there's only 3 reviews for this.  This was the first event I attended visiting Arizona before I moved here and I've been attending every year since.  Expectations going into this should be kept to: 1)People eating ginormous turkey legs 2)People dressed as Lords and Ladies and the occasional wench 3)You will get your fair share of  "thee's" and "thou's" 4)Men will be looking at the ladies wearing the corsets 5)Lots of walking  Shows play around the grounds for all ages including adults so plan to catch a few of them if you can.  The knife swallower is a hoot, Dead Bob is a riot, and the Tortuga Twins might not be for everyone.  The main arena holds shows all day that play into each other so it's good to catch all of them.  Don't be affraid to tip either.  For you guys reading this, here is your warning: there's lots of shopping here.  If your lady likes arts and crafts, your screwed.  Wood working, glass blowing and metal bending are just some of the items that are offered here.  The food is really the same as a fair or basic stadium concession stand.  Chicken strips and fries, pizza, and soup bread bowls taste good, but you didn't drive all that way for them.  Order a turkey leg and let your medieval side out as you tear through it old school.  Parking is free as you will pay for it in the price of admission and I look forward to seeing some of you there next year.

This Starbucks is my favorite because of the great customer service.  After awhile they memorized my name and, due to my ordering habits, had my order rung up before I go to the register.  This is great for mornings when I'm in a rush.  For that 5 stars.

My uncle has been telling me for years that his picture hangs right next to Ernie Banks. Naturally I told him he was full of crap. So when my other uncle flew down from San Francisco for spring training, we decided to see if he was really telling the truth.   The chopped liver appetizer tray was really good considering I've never had it nor was I even remotely interested by the sound of it.  I had a salad which was good (how can you really mess up a salad.)  Now I ordered the prime rib rare with fresh horseradish and a baked potato.  It was singlehandedly the best piece of red meat I've ever eaten.  Cooked to perfection (as was my wife's and uncle's steaks) just melted in my mouth like butter.  I've been to Fleming's, the Keg, and various other steakhouses, and they don't come close to this.  The horseradish was incredibly fresh with a lot more kick to it than normal.  The service was excellent with a very friendly staff.  The manager was more than helpful in trying to help us locate the picture of my uncle and his baseball team from Chicago.  He narrowed down the area for us and after 3 minutes of searching, low and behold, there it was.  19 years later the picture is still there.  I will go back, and not to visit the picture, but for the great food that awaits me.

How is it possible to mess up Chinese food you may ask?  Just come here during dinner time and you too can find out.  Pretty basic recipes just duplicated to death so they should know how to make it.  The beef and broccoli was very rushed as the broccoli was still cool compared to the really hot meat, not a lot of flavor with the sweet and sour pork, and the fried rice was still hard.  I've been here many times and had really good food.  Maybe it was an off night for the crew so I will go back and give it another chance.  Orange chicken is the way to go.

I go here for breakfast and i usually end up with a sandwich.  All sandwiches here are great and filling with the side.  Breads are freshly baked right there.  I have had breakfast here and the bagel egg sandwiches are pretty darn good.  Can be kinda cramped inside with a full house on weekends but the service is so quick I'm usually on the road before someones rug rat starts bumping into me.

Excellent gym that has everything I need. Plenty of machines, hot tub, showers and a locker. Downside is they close at 9pm on Saturdays and Sundays.  Not quite 24 hours but otherwise perfect.

So I decided to do yoga stretch on Monday.  Boy is that a workout.   First of all, bring your own yoga mat.  Bigger then the pads provided.   Second, don't be too out of shape like I am.  Not that I'm grotesquely out of shape, I was sweating like there was no tomorrow.  Which leads me to my third and final point.  Stay hydrated.  Your in Arizona so you should know this by now, but this will definitely dehydrate you if your not careful.  The class overall is excellent and the instructor could tell I was a noob and helped me out with my form so i didn't help myself.  I will be back again, just after I lose the beer belly.

Baseball should not be played in a dome.  But then again this is Arizona and it's ridiculously hot outside. That being said Chase field was handed down from the baseball gods to Phoenix and it has not disappointed one bit.  I've sat all around this stadium and there is not one bad seat to be had..... Even at the top in the nose bleed section.  You have the kid zone which looks fun for the kids (about 15 years too old for that) and Fridays Front Row (lots of fun for adults!) It is very kid friendly from the music to the mascot to the activities between innings.  The fans are some of the greatest in the league and very friendly.   Beware the team store though. You could go broke there will all the cool things to buy.  Now for what I rate best. The food is surprisingly good for a ballpark.  Besides the old school hot dog-soda-cracker jacks combo's, there is decent Mexican food, Peter Piper Pizza, Fatburger (my favorite,) Panda Express, and Cold Stone Ice Cream.  Booze prices are inflated naturally since you have no choice, but it's a small price to pay.  All in all, I've pushed aside my belief that baseball should not be played indoors and now enjoy visiting this fine establishment.

When new movies come out this is the place to go. As others have said, it is small, it is old, but it is quiet and a little cheaper than the bigger theatres.  Being married with no kids it is a great place to go for a movie.

Give me a Dilly Bird on Focaccia with potato salad and a Coke and I won't have to eat the rest of the day. Portion sizes are generous but most importantly delicious.  Haven't had a bad sandwich yet and I've tried half the menu.  Salad's are for rabbits so I won't be reviewing those but the soups are absolutely delicious. Try it if your in the neighborhood, you will not be disappointed.

My chow requires monthly grooming during the summer so I take him here.  The staff is super friendly to both my dog (Ewok is his name) and to myself.  He's a friendly dog but not exactly voluntary when it comes to groomers.  But since I've been taking him here he's been well behaved and happy to go which is important in my opinion.  The price is very reasonable and I can always get an appointment when i need it.  As far as the rest of the store is concerned, I wouldn't know.  I buy dog food from Costco.  But it looks like there are a lot of selections for every type of pet you could need.  They do run classes here for pet training on weekends, but other than that, I have no other info for you.  Good place for grooming though.

This place SUCKS! Now, I never thought I'd rate a fast food restaurant, but when it blows this badly, I had to tell someone.  Continuously soggy fries, screwed up orders in the drive through, filling the cup to 80% full, little petty things I know but when your in a hurry it can really screw with your day.   I will continue to eat there since it is the closest to my house, and I'm sure this won't be my last rant about it, but be warned, YOUR lunch hour can be ruined too by this place. /rant

Don't believe the sign out front. While it is an OK cheese steak, it's definitely not the world's best. I had to ask for cheese whiz, and it really wasn't that flavorful.  Bread was fresh, and they are made to order, but I would compare it to Steak Escape at the mall and a little overpriced.  The service is extremely friendly though, I will give that 5 stars, but my money will be better spent elsewhere.

I was a bit disappointed in the experience as a whole.  The food was meh, desert was pretty good, but way overpriced for what we got and not made for a big guy.  I've done fondue and been well full and satisfied, just not this time and not for what we spent.  Had the bread, vegetable cheese appetizer and the chicken, shrimp, and steak main.  Sauces were excellent, broth was meh again.  Desert is kinda hard to screw up but the chocolate was oily and clumpy, didn't melt well.  The scenery was excellent and decor is what a modern restaurant should be. I won't be back but try it yourself.

Boy I'm a hog in heaven again now that I've found this place. These burritos with the tin foil wrap make for the easiest lunches that are nice and filling. They also serve tacos, bowls and salads, but who wants those? I'm sure they're good, just haven't had one yet. Carne Asada burrito with no beans, extra rice, salsa, sour cream and cheese rocks.   Be prepared for lines around lunch, but they move quick so don't be alarmed. Friendly service is always there, epically when they tell you guacamole costs extra (only downside.)  This location does seem more oriented toward the lunch crowd as I've seen them bring out extra people to speed things up unlike other locations.  Hope to see you there.

After an hour and a half the pizza was excellent.  There was a charity event here last night where half the proceeds went to the family in need.  Their volume had tripled due to the event and they handled it very well.  I've never seen a pizza place on overdrive like that as I saw about 65 pizzas slung out in an hour.  My pizza was excellent.  Pepperoni and cheese with just the right amount of sauce.  Great crust and not too doughy made it perfect.  One dozen wings with Joe's Sauce had just the right flavoring.  Not too spicy but not plain either.  I was mainly a Barro's fan but I will come back here for the customer service and the great pizza.

As far as Filipino food in Arizona, this is the place to go.  Lots of choices to choose from.  Pancit freshly made right as you wait, halo-halo which is to die for, and the lumpia is just delightful.  The decor is plesant with Filipino television playing in the backround. The staff is ultra friendly and can speak English or Tagalog depending on your mood. Very clean place compared to the other Filipino places nearby, but the food speaks for itself.

It's a great buffet. If your not sure of what you want for lunch or dinner, this is the place to try out. Sushi, Mongolian grilling, Chinese, it's even got chicken wings.  I love it and will keep going back. Lunch is good at either 11AM or 1PM and dinner is good at 5-6PM if you like to avoid crowds. Haven't been there on a weekend yet.

This review is gonna be a little different. As much as I go here, you would think I love Mexican food. Truth is, I'm not a big fan at all. My wife loves it and with that, I'm bound to make an appearance once a week.   My two items that I rotate here are the California burrito, and the Cheeseburger. The burrito is the closest thing here I can get to Chipotle which I love, and the burger, well it's pretty good, but nothing special. The hidden gem here is the french fries. Man those are good. Cooked in the same oil as the tortilla chips, it really brings a different flavor to the fries.   One thing I can say about this restaurant that I love? The excellent customer service. I've never had a bad waiter or waitress and the manager is very involved in the customers experience as he does ask everyone if they've enjoyed themselves and if there is anything he can do to make it better.  That alone makes me want to come back.  And who knows, I might try something else on the menu.

I'm having a real hard time writing a review for this restaurant. I want to write a great review, but I don't wanna use the words "superb" or "excellent" when describing the food, and I don't wanna say the service was "friendly" since all of these are overdone. So let me give this a shot:   Upon walking inside I'm greeted with "The Saints Go Marching In" playing in the background and the aroma of some great food being served. The four of us go to the auxiliary bar (4 stools inside, main purpose is to drink up the patio guests) and have a seat and order drinks from our lovely waitress. Her timing was right on the button with EVERYTHING as drinks were always full and there was no lull between courses.   As for the food, WOW. For the appetizer I went with an order of the Lotsa Shrimp. One dozen cold boiled shrimp (whatever cold boiled means) served with cocktail sauce mixed with fresh horseradish. Boy let me tell you that puts every shrimp cocktail I've had between San Francisco and New York to shame. Just the right amount of kick to it, but not the same old lame old.   For the entree I had the Pasta New Orleans. Overall just an explosion in Cajun flavoring going on in my bowl. A wonderful blend of linguine, crawfish, sausage, mushrooms, and jumbo shrimp mixed in with a creamy yet spicy marinara sauce. And unlike every other place that skimps on the fish, you will not be disappointed here. Portions here are big, so bring an appetite.   I hate writing lengthy reviews, (yes this is lengthy to me) but this place deserves it. One of the best meals I've had in a long time as far as value for the meal, overall presentation of the meal and restaurant, and just an overall well trained and attentive staff.   I normally don't drive west of the 51 freeway, but I'm looking for reasons to do so now.

Holy crap is this place good.  With the gazillion milkshake flavors to choose from, I had vanilla....... kinda anti-climatic I know. Next time though.  The burgers were huge with 20 some odd topings to choose from. I had onions and pickles...... I know, another let down. Next time I sware.  Also the onion rings are tops here. Fries looked good too.  The decore is a nice 50's diner type with very friendly staff.  Outdoor seating is nice when it's not hot out and it's very close to the theatre which makes it the perfect stop before seeing Mama Mia........ J/K on that one. Saw Batman.

One of my favorite lunch spots has always been Churchill's. A quick pint of Tetley's and some fish and chips is just what the doctor ordered sometimes.  Have never had a bad fish and chips here, beer always ice cold from the tap, only down side being lunch lasts an hour.  I will try and go back during the night hours to watch some rugby and try something else off the menu.

I stand by my principle in saying Mexican restaurants have the best burger and fries. On a lovely ciabatta bun with pepper jack cheese and not cooked to shoe leather, that is how a burger should be.  Wife had the shrimp tacos and swore they were to die for.  Habanero wings? Hot. Very hot. But very good also.  Now we were in on Cinco de Mayo and it was packed so I'm not gonna ding the service for that, but you could tell they seemed to be a little unprepared for all the people. Live music was good and if your into cougar hunting this seems like a nice spot to try.

This place has become a new favorite of mine at Tempe Marketplace. A friend recommended this restaurant to us one night before the movies so we decided to give it a try. As I walked in, I looked at the bowls and chuckled. "There's no way that's gonna fill me up" I thought. Boy was I surprised.   So the general idea here is you get a bowl, walk down the line and throw in all the ingredients you want. From beef to chicken to a few fishes and the other white meat, there's no way they won't have what you want. Add some veggies at the next station then down to the sauce station. Here is where the fun is as you try and mix and match sauces to make something that tastes good. Next stop is the cook who asks what you want your concoction mixed with (rice, fried rice, udon noodles, a couple others I can't remember.) Five minutes later your eating what hopefully tastes good and the size is not disappointing.  I will forever be a fan of this joint as it gives me the ability to choose what I want in my food down to the detail.  The staff isn't as attentive when it's busy meaning empty drinks for a bit, but they are friendly and helpful when they are around.

Huh. Maybe I've been spoiled living by the ocean most of my life, but this is average fish & chips at best. I came here with a small group of people and decided to try a little of everything.  All I'm gonna say is this: frozen stuff you can buy at the store and make with less grease than what you get here.  I should have known better than to expect good fish & chips or even real crab.  But undercooked scallops and twice as much breading as there were shrimp, I was truely disappointed.  The fries were soggy and all in all, I could just feel my arteries clogging eating this.    I did give it an extra star because the staff was friendly, but I will never eat here again.

I love this Pita Jungle better than the one in Tempe for one reason. It's a little more open between tables and it's not so noisy.  Plus only being 5 minutes from my house makes it that much more convenient. Other than that the food is excellent (Stir fried vegetables with noodles and tofu is full of WIN.)  I will definitely eat there as long as it's open there.

Talk about simplicity, this place is as simple as it gets. A/C at 82 maybe, tables and chairs, and a chalkboard with a few items scribbled on it. But with food like this what else do you need?   Today I tried the Brown Chicken Stew served with rice and some sort of cabbage salad. I was skeptical when I opened my Styrofoam tray but that was put to rest with my first bite. Tender chicken, flavorful rice, and whatever that cabbage thing was.... excellent.   Maybe next time a restaurant opens up next to my dealership, I won't wait 9 months to try it out. Especially when it's this good.

If your into cigars, this is a definate must try.  With over hundreds to choose from, you are guaranteed to find something you like.  New to cigars? The staff is more than prepared to reccomend you a cigar.  Cigarettes are also sold here along with pipe tobacco and other smoking accessories.  And you know the best part? It's not the prices, even though those are pretty reasonable.  It's that you can have a seat on one of the couches, tables, or bar stools, grab a beer or glass of wine, and relax watching one of the many flat screens here.  Yes my friends, you can smoke inside.  While the selection of beer and wine are limited, it's just enough to hit the spot on the way home from work or watching the game on Sunday. A+ my friends!

This is a great place to get a good slice of pizza.  Situated right across the Cine-Capri at Tempe Marketplace, this joint has some great varieties of pizza.  Good old pepperoni for me, but it was very good.  And they had Cherry Pepsi which is always worth an extra star.  Cleanliness is a bit to be desired since a lot of people go in and out and it appears to be understaffed.  I will be back again as it's good food and the prices are just right.

A new lunch favorite for our dealership. This place has good food at great prices and delivers too. Looking at the menu there seems to be about 100 different entrees to choose from. The lunch menu is priced entirely under $5 with 39 different items to choose from.  The place is pretty simple inside, not too many decorations with seating outside on the patio. Service is quick and friendly, making this a great place to go if your in a hurry.
