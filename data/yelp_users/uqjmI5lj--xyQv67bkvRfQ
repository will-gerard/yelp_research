LAME, I came for an internet special and even after showing it to my server did not honor it due to the fact that no manger was available. BAD REVIEWS ARE A BITCH!

Great hike with excellent views of the city. Tons of people though. I would recommend getting here early and bringing plenty of water.

The people are all friendly and nice. The happy hour Buffalo chicken sliders with blue cheese hit the spot

I Love this Lake.  It is amazing how close this pristine lake is to Scottsdale.  If you take Butcher Jones road on the North side of the lake you can avoid some of the people traffic.

This is a relatively new place. I was here for the soft opening and was impressed. The place is in full swing now and Courtney said that they are playing around with a half off on TUESDAY concept. I will check in to test the waters,you should as well.

What a great new addition to the neighborhood. I met the owner and I knew right away this place is going to be a success. I can't wait till the weather cools off.
