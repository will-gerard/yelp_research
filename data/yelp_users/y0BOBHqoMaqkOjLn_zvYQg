I'm having a moment with China Chili. I kind of forgot it existed, and then I went there on Christmas day eve and was blown away! We shared orange chicken, mongolian beef, and chicken chow mein. Everything was so fresh and delicious, but I was specifically enchanted by the orange chicken. And the chow mein. Honestly, I couldn't stop eating it because it was so good! The chow mein is especially flavorful and addicting, I dream of it. I'm looking forward to coming here more often.

The LGO grocery is so cool, they have really neat and eclectic gifts and specialty items. I like to hop over here after enjoying a pizza to browse all of their fun items!

My mom and I love this place. The owners are so sweet and the food is divine. My Mom always orders the yellow curry dish every time we go there. I adore their thai basil dish with chicken. We frequent this place so much that the owners and chefs know my mom.  First of all, their lunch specials are awesome. There are many options, and they come with a cup of soup and a spring roll. Their soup of the day is always different and so, so delicious. I have gone in here just for the soup before! The dinner sizes are also available throughout the entire day, and the portions are pretty large. I would recommend the lunch specials though, its enough food and the soup and spring rolls are so yummy!!

This is long, the moral of the story is skip this place for sure, and go somewhere-anywhere-else.   My sister goes to this place every once in a while for a polish change, so when I was thinking about getting a manicure for myself I decided to come here. I never get my nails done because I can rarely afford it, so this was supposed to be a nice treat.   I walked in and was greeted and I was told they could take me immediately. So I quickly chose my polish colors (I was in a bit of a hurry) and waited for them to seat me. It took about 10 minutes for someone to take me to a station. I told my nail technician that I only had about a half hour for the manicure, and she said that would be no problem.   An hour later they told me that my nails were dry and I was ready to go. Since it took twice as long as they originally said, I had to rush home and change for an event. After changing, I got in my car and glanced down at my nails, only to see that each one was smudged, some nails had the polished completely wiped off.   Frustrated, the next day I went in to have the polish re-done. One of the women who works there, an older lady, glanced at my nails and said that she didn't see anything wrong with them. Then when I pointed out all of the smudges, I was told that they were "too busy" and to come back in an hour. Well, they closed in less than an hour. I went to run one errand and came back about a half an hour and the same woman (the older lady) was rude again to me. I asked to speak with the owner, who I stepped outside with and explained my situation.  She apologetically took me back in the store and set me up with my nail technician from the day before. This time she did a shellack manicure since it dries faster. When it came time for the top coat, the owner came over to do it her self. She snidely remarked that I was too impatient the day before and left before it was dry, which is not true. The fact that she had the nerve to say anything to me after the way I was treated the first two times was shocking. After my shellack dried, I left.   The shellack manicure lasted 3 days, even with good upkeep (I put a clear coat on it and I am never very hard on my nails).   Moral of the story, this is a horrible place to have your nails done. Skip this place and go somewhere with better service!!

I went to Guitar Center this week to buy a ukulele as a gift for my cousin's bar mitzvah and I was so impressed with the service! I am not very knowledgeable about musical instruments, but the sales rep was so knowledgeable, patient, and helpful. I had done a bit of research before I went in, and he took the time to further explain the different types of wood, sizes, etc.  Once we narrowed it down to a few different options, he played each one so I could see which one I like best. I went back again today to make the purchase, and he brought the ukuleles into the acoustic room so we could really hear them. Thanks to him I'm very confident with my purchase and now I kind of want a ukulele for myself so I can learn how to play!   The only reason I'm taking a star off is because he wasn't too happy when I tried to use a coupon I found online. I would have used the coupon online and picked up the ukulele in the store, but wanted to make sure I was getting the right one and I am a bit time-bound for the purchase decision. Regardless, I would come back here if I had questions or was in the market for an instrument.

I went back recently with a friend for happy hour. We were excited to have some sushi and enjoy a drink on this nice night. We were told that there were no tables outside available for happy hour except for high tops, where we could seat ourselves. As we walked over to the high top table area, we passed at least one open table in the happy hour section (for which we weren't even offered to wait). Our server brought us menus, waters, and then disappeared. When she finally came back, my friend ordered a blushing geisha. After that, the waitress left and over the next 25 minutes, frequently checked on her other tables around us, but ignored us completely. Finally, after getting her attention, she took our food order. I asked for a sample of a red wine, and the glass came out filthy and unpolished. When our food arrived, the server took our edamame before we had finished them. We also had to ask for soy sauce (the dispenser was empty), wasabi and ginger.   I was really shocked, because RA has such a good reputation. Needless to say, this server did not get a good tip, and the only reason I will return is because I am particularly fond of one of their happy hour items.

The next few times that I went in (2 times to be exact), there was a hair in my food. The first time I sent my food back, the 2nd time I spoke with a manager. Since speaking with a manager I have not had a problem, and he was very well-meaning and hospitable. The only thing that keeps me coming back is their garlic citrus yellowtail. It is ridiculously good, when there aren't hairs in it.

Okay, okay... I know this is like my 4th update, but things have really changed! RA has really stepped it up with its management and quality of food. I still LOVE their happy hour, and I am here at least once a week with friends. If there is ever a problem- and there rarely is anymore- the management fixes it at once. I still love the garlic citrus yellowtail, and have added new favorites to my list as well, including the crunchy calamari rill, zonie roll, rainbow roll, etc.  Although I still think most of their rolls are small (the zonie roll, and others), their happy hour prices make them affordable. I wouldn't go here during a regular, non-happy hour time, unless it was for a lunch special. In addition, their drinks are delicious. I like the dragon bite and the blushing geisha. I really recommend going in for their happy hour deals!  One pointer - I do not recommend sitting in the bar area. The service in that area has not improved, and you can get the same happy hour prices in the dining room area with far better service. The only downfall to the whole indoor area of the restaurant is that it is very, very loud. Also- they could improve their hostesses a little- I don't know if it is a lack of training or what, but they always seem clueless, cold and brash.

The only redeeming quality of this place is that they serve Papago Orange Blossom Wheat Beer.  I went here expecting something delicious. We had both heard good reviews, and are both burger fans so we were excited to see what Delux had to offer. Their menu was very limited in the burger region, with only two to choose from and no option to "build your own burger" like many burger places have. In addition, their burgers and other menu items are very over priced in my opinion. This restaurant takes pride in serving fresh ingredients. This may be true, but we both left feeling less than fresh. We were both nauseous, and the food resulted in me nearly throwing up a handfull of times.   We ordered two delux burgers; mine was served well done and his was served medium-well. Each burger came with a small side of fresh fruit. We also ordered the half and half fries. I was not impressed by the burger, and thought it was too sweet. I only ate half of mine.   After battling through hours of nausea, I called to speak with the manager. She refused to acknowledge that her establishment was the cause of our nausea and sickness. She told us to "further investigate" what he had consumed prior to eating there (but this was the first time we had hung out in 2 days due to complicated schedules- so it was the only meal we had shared). She kept saying to "further investigate" what could have made us sick, when we were both certain that it had been the food from Delux. The way that she handled the situation was less than professional, to the point of being insulting. She kept saying that they get their ingredients fresh daily, implying that since their ingredients were fresh, they couldn't have made us sick- which is absurd because there could have been one thing in there that was handled wrong or cooked incorrectly. Then she told me that she would "further investigate" with her head chef, and said she would call me back. She called me back less than 5 minutes later, which convinced me that she obviously didn't care and probably didn't check with the chef.   Personally, if I were the manager, I would have apologized for us not feeling well and I would have invited us to come in again, on the house, to try the restaurant again. Instead of handling it like this, she infuriated me beyond belief. The only reason I would ever go back would be to get the beer again, but I definitely wouldn't eat their food.

I am kind of obsessed with Butterfields' Gluten Free Pancakes! They are seriously to die for, and you can't tell they're gluten free! I have been back many times just for a stack of pancakes, and I even get them to-go sometimes ;)  Their "skillets" are also super delicious- hashbrowns topped with your favorite things, like cheese, veggies, and chorizo, plus 2 eggs cooked your way. Yum!

I love Fancy Fry's!!  Their floral section is unbelievable, they always have an amazing selection of both mixed bouquets, potted flowers and single flower arrangements are gorgeous!  I also appreciate the additional amenities they have - the wine cellar, sushi bar, smoothie bar, expanded cheese selection, etc. These keep me coming back!

I really like this place, and so does my family. I have only eaten in the restaurant once, and I can't really remember it but we almost always order takeout. Their pan-fried noodles are fantastic, especially when the noodles are extra crispy! Their pineaple chicken is so yummy, and the black bean shrimp is DELICIOUS!! Their fried rice is amazing, especially if you get the house fried rice with the pork in it. It also comes with 1 or 2 shrimp on the side. Really, really good. My Dad used to travel to China a lot with work, and says this place is as authentic as it gets in the area.

This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their dishes are always very consistent, fresh and authentic. Our family will return here again and again, but we almost exclusively order takeout. Our favorites include pineaple chicken, mu shu chicken, black bean anything (shrimp or chicken), pan fried noodles.. the list goes on. I highly recommend the Nee House! But I would suggest ordering takeout, their service isn't great at all.

I got one of my best haircuts of my life at ETCH! I highly recommend. They seem to only employ very high-end beauticians, and I appreciate that level of service. They also offer free bang trims once you've had your hair cut there before.

Sushi does not get better than this. I have been going here since I started eating sushi- this was the first sushi restaurant my parents ever took me to. I think I was somewhere around 10 years old, and my family has remained a loyal customer ever since (somewhere around 12 years). We go here for every occasion; birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, family in town, friends want to go to lunch, craving sushi- whatever it is! We love this restaurant! We usually always order the same things, because they are just so delicious.  -Shrimp tempura roll: you will never have one quite like this. It is amazing. Topped with eel sauce, what more can you ask for? -Spicy tuna roll: try not to devour all of the end pieces, because they are the best! This is without a doubt the best spicy tuna roll I have ever had in my life. -Spider roll: this is stuffed with a flavorful fried softshell crab, crab meat, etc. My mom orders this every time we go here, and you are lucky if she will share a bite. -Albacore tuna sashimi: the best. I have to get at least 1 piece.  -Agadashi Tofu: you can split this with someone, or indulge in it by yourself. The best appetizer on the menu.   Everything here is amazing. If the service is slow, have a little patience. Enjoy the company you are in, sip some green tea and smile with the knowledge that you're about to eat the best sushi in the valley. If you sit at the sushi bar, you will be entertained and delighted with conversation with the chefs.

THE END OF AN ERA What once was the best sushi restaurant in Phoenix is now under new management, and it definitely shows. They have tried to bring in new rolls similar to those at every other sushi place. They have changed the ingredients in many of their rolls, including the spicy tuna roll and the shrimp tempura rolls, which were the ones that kept us coming back. Kampai was special because it wasn't like every other Scottsdale sushi place, it had the freshest ingredients and the most authentic rolls. Not anymore.  The quality of the ingredients is now very poor compared to what it used to be. The fish is sliced way too thin. The rolls were not as fresh or as tasty even in the slightest. Their spicy tuna roll, which used to have fresh tuna and cucumbers and sprouts, is now made with a mixture of chopped tuna and spices with "Krab" mix.   They changed their entire staff, which will come back to bite them sooner or later. The new sushi chef was rude, did not want to engage in conversation, and plainly did not acknowledge us. Our order was taken much later than we were ready to give it, and we had to ask for waters. Then, another chef came into the sushi bar area from the back wearing a plain tshirt, not a uniform, and without washing his hands he began to make our food. There were several questionable instances when cleanliness did not seem to be a concern of the sushi chefs.   Sanitation is major at a sushi restaurant, and so is the food. So is the service. So is the music (which they changed from nice traditional music to soft rock?!). Since all of these things have changed, my family who has been long-time customers of Kampai for the last 15 years will sadly not be returning. Kampai, you just lost some previously dedicated customers.   At least we went here in May for my birthday before they changed, I wish we knew it would be the last time that we could enjoy our favorites. I don't see how they will stay open for much longer.

I came here tonight with a friend and was blown away. I can't believe that with all of their dazzling reviews I have never even heard of them! The staff was very patient with us while we tried nearly half of their favors. I decided to get 2 scoops, while my friend got a sundae. I got a scoop of the basil lime sorbet and a scoop of lavender. They were so great! All of their favors are very creative and satisfying. Although the prices are a little high (4.50 for 2 scoops), it's well worth it for the difference in quality and flavor. I would highly recommend coming here, and I will definitely be back.  Update: Pretty sure I went in every day for a week. This is my new favorite ice cream place, price is not even a factor anymore! The best, most creative ice cream and sorbet I've ever had.

I LOVE everything about Kona Grill.  If you love appetizers, go for their happy hour where all appetizers are half off and select sushi items are at a special price, as well as drinks. The ahi tuna on wonton crisps are a-m-a-z-i-n-g!! I can not go here without ordering them! Also, their calamari is fantastic.   As far as sushi goes, the wave roll is to die for.  My favorite entree, by far, is the miso-sake marinated sea bass. Oh. My. Goodness. I have never, ever in my life found an entree that I like more. The fish is like butter, it melts in your mouth, and the marinade compliments it perfectly. The fried rice on the side is so, so delicious and the grilled broccolini is to die for. Really, a perfect dinner.  The service is always fantastic.   Also, if you sign up for their email club, they send you a certificate for a free appetizer or sushi roll for signing up, and a certificate for a free entree on your birthday! Can't beat that!!

We were very disappointed by this restaurant. We expected to be impressed, and simply were not. This place does not live up to its hype.   We came here for a birthday dinner, and I had a certificate for a free Beef Medallions with Shrimp Scampi. We also ordered the Brio Chopped salad and Calamari.   The salad was delicious, but we weren't impressed by much else. The calamari was tasteless to say the least. The beef medallions were not cooked to our preference- we ordered them medium rare and they came out well done. The shrimp scampi included only a few shrimp on top of the medallions, all sitting on a bed of orzo pasta and small pieces of roasted vegetables tossed in a sauce.   We were just disappointed. I would suggest going somewhere else.

Lola Coffee is one of my favorite coffee shops in Phoenix! I thought they closed a while back and was so thrilled to learn that they opened again on 3rd Ave. I don't live nearby so it's a treat when I make my way down to their cute brick cafe. My favorite coffee at Lola is the matador - hot chocolate with cinnamon and espresso. I love to order it as a cappuccino with lots of foam. The quality of the coffee is so much better than the big box stores, and it's what makes the trip down here worth it. The staff is always so friendly and the patio is a comfortable and cozy place to enjoy a weekend morning, with a little succulent garden and tiny finches flitting about. Lola Coffee is just about the definition of weekend goals.

I came here after finding it on yelp. Their food is very fresh, with the chicken carefully laid across the vegetables and rice with sauce on top. The presentation is really lovely for a fast food-ish place. In addition, the staff was super friendly. I told them it was my first time dining there, and they advised me to order the ginger chicken bowl, which I loved. I also ordered the crab puffs, after seeing so many positive reviews. The crab puffs were not all cream cheese like at other places, they were filled with crab and had some green onions, too. Be careful if you order these- they make them fresh for each order and they are HOT when they first come out! I dipped them in both the sweet and sour and the hot sauce that can be found at the sauce bar.  I wish I had gotten brown rice, but now I know for next time. I recommend this place if you are looking for a quick, cheap, asian fix in the area.

I got a teriyaki bento box to go from here today, and they forgot to include rice. Seriously? They sent the to go order with soy sauce packets, but no rice. It came with soup but they didn't put a spoon in the bag, only chop sticks. I would expect a nice place like this to be a little more attentive, especially since it was after 2pm on a weekday.

After having a very disappointing appointment with a different dermatologist in the area, vising Phoenix Skin was a relief. Mike was very knowledgeable and was able to work out a treatment plan for my acne that I hope will be very effective. I have an appointment with Jenna next week for my first chemical peel to help boost my acne scar recovery. I'm so happy with my whole experience with Phoenix Skin so far and am excited to finally have a specialist who cares and who actually wants to help me clear my skin. I would recommend Phoenix Skin to anyone!

I'm crazy about this place!!! Their frozen yogurt is delicious, and it is serve yourself so you can mix and match whatever flavors you like! They also have almost 50 different toppings to choose from, including fresh fruit, candy, nuts and chocolate or caramel sauce. The price is right too, especially this weekend! 50% off for the rest of the weekend. I will definitely be back

Reathrey Sekong is one of my absolute favorite gems in the valley. I recently set a goal to try more types of ethnic cuisine, which is what drew me to this little restaurant off of Indian School. I've never had Cambodian food before dining here, so I have nothing to base it off of, but after some research I learned that Cambodian food is a bit of a mix of Thai and Vietnamese with some French influence. I have now been here 5 or so times and it is my goal to eat everything on the menu - each dish is unique, surprising, and absolutely delicious.   I somehow convinced my not-so-culinary-adventurous best friends to come to dinner here with me. We ordered a myriad of things, including egg rolls, spring rolls, the basil seed drink, chicken fried rice, BBQ platter, and Bainyachav crepes. Everything was fantastic and even my picky eater bff's were impressed! So I quickly convinced my boyfriend to come back with me ASAP.   This time we both ordered katheaw cha- rice noodles with beef, shrimp, broccoli, and carrots. Yes- we both got the same thing and both loved it, and both thoroughly enjoyed our leftovers!  The third time I went with my team, and there were about 15 of us. It was a "one of everything" type of night, and everyone loved it. It was so fun to try things on the menu that I may not have ordered (now that I'm hooked on the Katheaw Cha and Loat Cha), like the Amok Fish. That being said, here are the dishes from Reathrey Sekong that I daydream about:  - Egg Rolls - Spring rolls - Katheaw Cha and Loat Cha, flavors of which are really similar but they feature different noodles  - Bainyachav Crepes - Beef Skewers  Give it a try - you won't regret it!

I like Zoyo, but I'm not sure I would come here if it weren't for the little girl I babysit who loves their yogurt. Sometimes I just feel like their flavors are too processed, and all of their yogurts regardless of dairy content or flavor have high fructose corn syrup in them.  If you do go here, try the cake batter or the oatmeal cookie flavors, with toasted coconut.

I really wanted to like Slickables - ice cream sandwiched between two cookies!? For only $2!? Who could say no? Unfortunately, you really get what you pay for. This is probably a super popular spot for ASU college students, and I'm sure it is packed on warm nights when everyone is out on Mill, but I'm sad to say that the quality is not that great. To me, quality is far more important than the price, and in this case they just didn't get that right. It satisfied the craving but I'll stick with Sweet Republic for my ice cream sandwiches.

I was so disappointed by our experience at this restaurant. I've wanted to try Pizzeria Bianco for a long time - it is on a national list of best pizza places in the country, and it's in my city. Plus they serve my favorite style of pizza, so we should have been in for a treat.  It started before we even got to see a menu. We walked in on a Monday night and there were various open tables in the front room, we couldn't see in the back. There was one 2-top open and two 4-tops. I asked if we could have a 4-top because we like to sit next to each other when we go out, and it was our anniversary. The hostess then went on a rant about how she has to seat us at a table for two in case bigger parties come in, so that she can have the other tables open, but since we are the customer she has to seat us where we want, yada yada... I was a hostess for years, I know how that works, but I've never actually told a customer all of that because in my opinion the right answer is always "yes," unless you actually have reservations for bigger parties and you have to save those tables. So after huffing and puffing, she sat us at the worst of all of the tables, right in front of the door and the kitchen, so there was a ton of traffic going past us all night and the door was opening and shutting, blowing cold air on us. This really bothered me because the other two tables were beautiful, quiet, and the other 4-top was more secluded near a window. Our view was of the front door, which is not really where I want to be looking when I am enjoying an anniversary date. Our table was just awkward and I felt so uncomfortable with the other (better) open tables around us.   Throughout our meal the hostess proceeded to seat parties of two at the other tables...  Our server came and took our order, and brought us bread and oil. I know some reviewers complained about the oil and bread being bland, but I actually enjoyed the delicate flavors of the oil.  We ordered two pizzas and our server seemed disappointed that we didn't order more.   The pizzas left something to be desired. They were really under seasoned and tasteless. We ordered the Wise Guy and the Margherita pizzas. The Margherita is my favorite kind of pizza, and the pizza I use to judge most restaurants. The basil was fresh but the flavor of the tomato sauce was really lacking the level of freshness and robust flavor of other restaurants. The Wise Guy really needed salt. Usually with this type of pizza I can eat most of one by myself because of the thin crust, but I barely finished 3 pieces.  Our server never came to check on us.   The only good thing I can say is at least the Margherita tasted better as cold leftovers.

I love this place! It has a similar concept as Chipotle, but so much better. I first tried their taco at Hotel Thrillist last year and immediately fell in love! Pro tip: get enchiladas with the tomatillo chicken AND the sweet and spicy cornbread in the enchilada with green sauce on top - sweet, spicy and savory, all in 1 enchilada?! Sign me up! I also love how you can choose any toppings you want, which means you can customize your dish to whatever you feel like that day. Their toppings are phenomenal, and I usually like to get a little bit of everything- fresh slaw and pico de gallo, pickled red onions, crema, cotija cheese, and the Gadzooks buttermilk sauce (G SAUCE!).   You have to try this place.

I went here for dinner last night and for less than $10, my Dad and I got a Charburger, Teriyaki Charburger, and Onion Rings. I had the Teriyaki Charburger, which had grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce on it. I ordered it lettuce wrapped and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor. The onion rings were out of this world! They also have a small cold bar near the beverage station that has a few different types of spicy peppers, so I added pickled jalapeños to my burger. It was delicious. It is along the same price range as Five Guys for the burgers, and they also have some additional menu items like chicken sandwiches, an ahi tuna sandwich, salads, etc. Next time I would love to try their tempura fried green beans! Yum.

We loved Ingo's! A group of three of us came here after hiking Camelback, so we were really ready for burgers. I enjoyed the Farmer's Daughter burger with bacon, and we all split the "chips" and deviled eggs. Everything was so fresh and flavorful, and I loved the flavor combination of the chips with the lebni + homemade hot sauce. They also had chocolate chip sea salt cookies that were way too delicious to even be real. I can't tell you how many cookies I ate, but I can tell you I'll be back!  Edited to add the service was great! Friendly and very helpful with giving us suggestions on what to order!

Some comments from my friends as we ate:  "The best wiener I've ever tasted" "Best toppings on a... hot dog..."  Seriously, this hot dog was amazing. I had the El Mexicano, with cherry pepper relish, the most perfect sauces ever to be put on a hot dog, avocado (!!!) and other goodies. If you're in The Container Park area, this is the best place to grab a snack and a cold beer. We'll be back for sure. Just be sure to finish your beer before you leave the park... they won't let you take it out!

I really like this place! We went for their "Free Salad Day" to celebrate the opening. Everyone who works here was so friendly and helpful, we had great customer service! I got the Don Quixote, a salad with mango, roasted corn, shrimp, avocado and cheese. They let me sub cotija instead of jack cheese, and add craisins. It was so yummy! I only have two complaints: the mango looked like it came out of a can (ew) and the salad, even without dressing, didn't hold up well as leftovers. I got one to take to lunch the next day and the greens had wilted somewhat. It was still yummy, just not as fresh.   I will definitely go here again though, especially for that salad! The shrimp were so fresh and everything so flavorful, I would just like to see fresh mango. Also, add the Mad Spice to your salad- it gives a great kick and flavor!

Pure Barre is my favorite barre workout that I've done in the area so far! Their sign outside that says something along the lines of "We aren't scared to be the most challenging bar workout" is pure truth because you WILL get a workout in these classes! Every class is so difficult - your muscles will be shaking, in a good way!   I really liked going to the 5:45 am class because, ending at 6:45, I had the perfect amount of time to get ready, have a good breakfast, and make it to work. Plus, the feeling of accomplishment after these classes is like nothing else - especially in the morning! I feel like I can accomplish anything afterwards. I love their music and they have great instructors too.  Can't wait to come back for more!

I have eaten here multiple times and expect much better than my visit today. The person taking orders seemed inexperienced, plus he didn't know what was in several sushi rolls and had to actually open a menu to check. Since their lunch menu has changed, I ordered the chicken teriyaki with brown rice and the California crunchy roll. The Cali roll's crab filling seemed dry, and the teriyaki sauce left something to be desired.   A few hours after lunch there  I began to feel nauseous, sick and feverish. I had chills and fought nausea for a few hours before it subsided.   I think this place has gone downhill even though they have tried to make it more upscale. The prices have gone up, but after my experience today I can see that the quality has not followed suit.  For $10 I would have rather had a sushi roll from Fry's at Tatum and Shea.
