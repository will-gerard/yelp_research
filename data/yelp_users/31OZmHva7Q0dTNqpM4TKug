HOT HOT HOT.  And did i mention hot? If you love spicy dishes full of flavor, take a drive over and have a feast.  I am writing this several weeks after my visit, so i do not remember much specifics but the dry hot pot dishes were amazing.. oh and for a tasty rare treat, get the xiao long bao.. they are little dumplings filled with meat and soup, a must try.  And that guy "Jihan L." is correct about the tingly numbing feeling, i welcome it !

What can I say that hasn't been said about Postino, the original location is definitely a must go, the atmosphere is just as good as it was when I first went over 5 years ago and the food has just gotten better, more refined. As all would say, get a bruschetta board and bottle of wine and call it a day, you and your date will have the perfect night.  must picks are the prosciutto and apple.

I was in the area and asked a friend if they had good soup, and he replied.. "the T2" is good.  I didn't know what a T2 was, but i decided to go anyways.. while i looked over the menu i saw that they had Kimchi Chigae and ordered that.  I was not disappointed, it was really really good.. full of flavor and all the banchan (side dishes) they gave me were fresh and yummy.

The only surprise here is that it's just as amazing every time I come in. Not only is the chicken amazing but the people are so nice it seems almost like they are there just for me.  Definitely try them out.  Today I got a Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap with Spicy dressing, the wrap was not overwhelming and the bread actually had flavor, i didn't tear away prices like I do with most wraps at fast food joints.

Want a rice plate? A noodle dish? Eggrolls? or maybe one of the greatest bowls of Pho in Arizona? then head over to Pho43rd .. they have a straight forward menu which is great for lunch, especially for people like me that will read EVERYTHING and take forever to decide.. what i like about this place is the "express" it is fast because they have a select menu, that does not mean they have a limited menu, the food is amazing, and they chose the dishes that pretty much maximize flavor and timeliness.  I am not saying do not go for dinner, because you will be satisfied then too.  Oh, and if you savor great coffee like i do, when you order your iced coffee, ask for it in a to go cup =)

Went here looking for a straight razor refill, the good quality kind, with the GF, when we first walked in she was asked kindly to leave her bag at the counter, which she gladly did (i think so i couldn't sucker her in to paying) I am glad i did not have my satchel on.  The worker explained to me the differences between razors and what i ended up leaving with was a safety razor, which i am extremely happy with.  Not only was it cheaper than what i was originally looking for, but i like using it better, the weight makes shaving an event and not a task.  She also helped me find a nice shaving brush and lather.  I would return, but not sure why i would need to, i got what i wanted!

I wanted to like it, i really did.. i even waiting 45 minutes in the cold hoping for a great experience.  What we have here is a typical Scottsdale joint, trendy and hip(ster).  The eggs benedict was ok, but eclipsed by even Village Inn's version, they did have decent coffee though, and once seated in our cramped booth, the service was great.

FYI, it's bad luck to have chopsticks sticking up in a bowl. Re: Chinese chicken salad  Anyways, the burgers are not what they once were, or my tastebuds have greatly evolved.  Mine was no good, no good at all, if i were not so hungry i would have sent it back. Yeah, that bad.  The fries were good though!

All i wanted was a little mu shu.. but boy was i surprised at the large portions, the dish i ordered was the Spicy Mu Shu Burrito with Chicken and Beef with Fried Rice.. yeah i paid a little bit extra to get the combination of meats, but to me it is worth it..  The flavors are so unique and satisfying that i wish i could finish two.

I am not sure i  even need to write a review, all the others speak for themselves.. i could recommend a few dishes, but not sure what the point would be.. EVERYTHING is great here. from the stone hot pot soups to the french iced coffee.  Ask your server what is good, they will not lie or promote something that is not.  I will plug one item, the grilled pork spring rolls are amazing.. so there, i started you off..

Never disappoints.. Today I had a work lunch and ordered the appetizer #2 Goi Cuon.. (Grilled pork, shrimp, and vegetable spring rolls) a Vietnamese iced coffee, and for my entree I can haz #39 Com Dac Biet So 2 (grilled pork tenderloin and beef with fried vegetable rice) instead of the eggroll I asked for a fried egg.. It was all amazing. And the selection of condiments such as hoisin, sriracha, and chili paste can make it even more flavorful.

First the good. Theaters are not that packed and are nice and clean. They show the regular current movies and some indie selections you may not find at other theaters.   The bad. Seems like quite a bit more theater hoppers than most movie theaters I have been to, they tend to be obnoxious at times.   The ugly. Nothing really, I frequent this place because it is easy to get to and close to the house.

Always a pleasure, almost always get the same roasted chicken with red rice.. They make the chili pepper sauce in house, and i always add an fried egg for good measure Sometimes we do family style and share dishes, haven't had a plate I didn't like. Ask for a side of broth if you feeling a little squirrelly

Honestly this place has taken over as the best Dim Sum place in the East Valley, and possibly all of Arizona if Great Wall doesn't step their game up.  One dish that you need to order here is the Xiao Long Bao, it is no Din Tai Fung but it makes me happy with every soup exploding bite.

Pretty much anything is good, today I decided on the grilled chicken club :)  Was not disappointed, usually the bacon is a little bit flavorless, but today is was delicious. The lettuce was not soggy (which is surprising because they do not use iceberg) and the tomato (which i always remove one) was pretty good too.

Love the small non corporate feel to this place, I work in the area so i usually stop in for lunch, their specials are priced well and i always have something to take home to munch on, anything that is breaded is fried perfectly and grilled is grilled perfectly. Their sauces go perfect with their dishes, no overbearing flavors here.  I also enjoy their udon soup specials, try one out if you haven't already.

This visit was great, i can not get over how kind and genuine the staff are, if you are ever in the need of some smiling faces and good food, drop in for a bite.  More importantly, the food..  I enjoy any place that gives me an asparagus option, i got it with beef, i am not sure what oil they use, but it burns so clean that i got all the seasoning flavor without it being overwhelmed by any oil tinge.  Will definitely go back.. again and again

The Tofu Soup is amazing.. that alone carries this restaurant to the four stars.  If you love food as much as i do, it will help you overlook the extremely overbearing AC vents that sometimes pound down upon you all year long, or the service that is catered towards the more "ethnic" (cough korean cough) patrons.  example : i walked in with my party, and they told me to wait because they have to clean some tables, a group of ethnic individuals walked in.. waited behind us for a little bit, then walked over and spoke in korean to the other staff member and were sat down before us.  so yeah.. i was upset but did not mind after i had the taste of their yummy soup again.

my first review..  i read them alll the time on here, and after following some reviews and decided to eat here.  the service was amazing, the food was even better.. some of the freshest chinese i have had in AZ.. the variety you can order from is extensive to any tastes you or your family might have.. the atmosphere is versatile as well, good for a quick bite or a nice date.  i felt like i needed to write one in regards to the "Andrew C." person.. this guy must have never had chinese food to believe this is akin to pei wei .. or even less asian than it.  he probably ordered the most american dish he saw. he must be a sweet n sour lover (not that there is anything wrong withthat)

Probably my favorite Hawaiian restaurant in Arizona, i only say probably because the folks at Leo's are the nicest of the nice, the food here though...  It is amazing, you may be struck buy the seemingly endless combinations of 1, 2, or 3 item dishes pictured on the wall.. but fear not, all taste great.  Just decide, do i like beef, chicken, or fish and then choose (it will save you a ton of time) .. and then you get to the sides, that's up to you.  I personally ALWAYS get the island fried chicken, I'm not even sure if that is what they officially call it here, but they know.  It is chunks of perfectly fried and seasoned chicken that just explodes with flavor once you bite into it. MAKE SURE YOU FIND THE WANDERING BOTTLES OF THE CHILI SAUCE (gochujang)

Just a quick gripe, i usually love this place, but i went in after volunteering at a nearby church (pat on the back) only to have my night ruined by a server who instead of bringing me my pizza, brought me a sandwich, then told me it was my fault, and did not talk to us for the rest of the night.  Me returning is dependent on if i hear back from management or not.

Well folks, froyo is typically froyo, and i found nothing bad about the actually yogurt and fruits.  What did strike me as being curious and warranting two stars is an offensive flavor.  the "white boy vanilla" sure they may be trying to be funny, but it is in poor taste, children love froyo, and i am sure they inquire, "mommy, what is white boy vanilla?" if they had a similar name for a chocolate or banana flavor, i am sure they would have the ACLU boycotting the place.

this was not my first Ah-So experience, i have been to other locations.. with that being said, i have to admit it was different. not in a bad way, just a little different, the wide open layout was actually kind of cool, and the hanging plasma tvs and sporting decor are just out of a eye range in case you do not want to see them. but set well so if you do want to watch the game or jersey shore reunion.  the wait was non existent, maybe because i went on a tuesday afternoon.. tho i think wait times should be addressed in a review, i would never dock a point for a long wait..   now onto the food, i ordered an iced green tea, it was good, some places use a different tea for the iced, but this is hot tea over ice, +1 for that.  i ordered the tuna tartar, as i try to as often as possible when i have sushi.. and it was good, but... not the best i ever had.(drake) the soft-shell crab roll left nothing to be desired, perfectly tasty.  i even tried one of the vegas rolls on my table, it was pretty good, i usually do not eat those types of rolls, but i may again now =) i ordered a sashimi sampler type item, it was delicious.. seems as fresh as you could get in Arizona. for my main course i ordered a combination fillet and chicken.. it was great.. they give you two sauces with it.. fried rice, and just the right amount of perfectly cooked vegetables. +1 again  and i did not forget the red bean ice cream.. very good =) the service was nice, the staff were very personable and not drab like many you encounter mid week.   oh, and i also had a water.. which was filled up often.. and i read a horrible review that almost made me not want to come, i decided to go ahead and ignore his review..because with a name like "Caleb B."  i was perfectly convinced he was an expert on asian food #sarcasm

Food is decent, so if you're expecting to just grab a bite, it's fine. If you're ordering to go, be warned they don't pack anything and they must place your order behind others. I ordered a meal for ONLY 4 people and it took 30 minutes, I called ahead and people that ordered while I was waiting were getting their food. Their excuse was they just opened when I called. yeah I was late for my lunch.

Food: Good enough as always  Service: Ordering today was harder on me than my last breakup, the girl at the counter didn't know they had a "combination feast" or able to describe what was included in it. Then didn't ask what side I wanted, the cook asked me after and I said salad, come to find out I already had a salad included, so whelp, wasted my side. They want $15 and hour for this, for the price of our food, they should hire/train decent help.

This place has improved tremendously, the quality and flavor is much better than it had been, it tastes like when they first opened. The menu had also been expanded. For anyone who hasn't been I recommend you give it a try and anyone who had been put off by a prior visit, I suggest you give Republic another chance.. Maybe try something different this time. The tonkotsu was great with te addition of corn and an egg, and the Sopporo was pretty good too. To even out the review I will say I'm not sure why they decided they needed to shower the kimchi with scallions or why the seaweed salad was so sweet, not in a bad way, just different. they need to perfect their noodles a bit, but it won't stop me from coming back.  :)

Was meeting up with someone for lunch in the area and decided to try it out since some friends have mentioned it before. Kind of an odd parking lot due to a Churches Chicken taking up most of the corner and HS kids are roaming around all the time. Just be patient and roll in. The lady at the counter was very nice, she not only answered our questions but asked a good amount of her own, very personable. I ordered the Cali burger with an egg and the ghost pepper cheese, It. Was. Amazing. The bread, it's always about the bread.. Perfection, amazing texture, kind of like Fuddruckers.  The meat patties were cooked perfectly and were delicious, especially with the fried egg bleeding yolk onto it. The kicker was the ghost pepper cheese, it was a good spicy, very flavorful, not hot just for the sake of being hot. Oh, and they have the largest selection of root beer you can possibly imagine, aaaand I got Dr Pepper.

I order takeout from here all the time, love the place. Is it like flying to Hawaii and popping into your favorite grind house? Nope.  Is the food delicious and satisfies your cravings for Hawaiian BBQ? heck yes, honestly you can not go wrong with anything on the menu..  From the lighter Lemon Pepper Chicken to the BBQ Beef  on to the gravy topped Loco Moco and ending with the Spam Musubi, it is all perfectly flavored and cooked.    Price point is spot on as well.  oh and don't forget to pour some sriracha on your mac salad!

Heck, even the regular pancakes with butter and syrup deserve applause.  Super nice staff to boot.

Being the food snob that i am, i did not want to go here. in my head i thought, "oh great, another wanna be cheesesteak shop." But it was late, and for some reason i was in Tempe, so i tried it out with a couple of friends.. to be honest the sandwich i ate was not the best, but that was only because i got "pepper crazy" and ordered three different kinds of peppers for my hoagie. i swapped half of mine with my friends regular whiz steak, and i was instantly happy.  The bread was soft but a little refreshing in a way to not be harder as i expected. Service was good, and i was able to watch the rest of The Fast and The Furious that was playing,

If you are reading about Raising Cane's, chances are that you have been here already, or know they are known for their amazingly fresh and crispy delicious chicken tenders and secret Cane's sauce.  This review is for those who think fries and a tasty slice of Texas toast is too much to handle with your tenders.  Every time i get gas at QT i hit the drive thru and order just 3 tenders and 1 Cane's sauce, and it satisfies.  Update: got soggy strips last time, they said my next meal was on them, they replaced the strips but charged me for the sauces because they said I didn't claim there was anything wrong with them previously, past couple times I came, I was nickel and dimed for an ice water in the drive thru.

When i first realized L&L was gone i was disappointed, but that was soon eclipsed by joy after i had a taste of what they had to offer.    An example would be the potato croquette to start out with, it is basically mashed potato fried to crispy goodness with a to die for katsuesque sauce drizzled on top.. next up would be the surf n turf roll which is amazing, not often do you find filet mignon on a roll.. i enjoyed the hamachi kama too, which is a cooked to perfection yellowtail collar, pure bliss.  Then to wash it all down they have a iced barley tea that is super refreshing, i am sorry but exact name escapes me, which is ironic because you have to ask for it by name..   oh and i can not forget the tempura ice cream, it is fried ice cream at its best.     This is honestly the best sushi joint in Arizona since Celsius closed down (if anyone has been there).. i eat all around the valley too.. but do not take my word for it, try it yourself, you will not be disappointed one bit, i promise.

You can not go wrong with this place, any bagel sandwich you can possibly order is amazing.  I usually decide to try new things, and i am not close to running out of combination, the owners/staff are amazingly helpful and are some of the most friendly and people in the biz.  Try a turkey, bacon, egg, and cheese on a jalepeno bagel.. awesome   And to "dennis c." maybe you should not order the salt bagel next time, just a thought.

Was excited after a night on the town this past weekend to go to one of my favorite cheesesteak spots in Arizona. Call it temporary insanity or ADHD, but i did not even notice the place was renovated, at first i thought to myself, "good for them.." but i kind of liked the hipster look, well the new setup is neo hispters anyway.  I was excited as always to get my hoagie..  yeah.. not what i was expecting, it was as if they outsourced their quality control to China or India.  The bread was certainly not up to par, meat was not as tender as i remembered, the cheese.. well it was ok.  It all made sense when someone told me the old owner left and someone else took the spot.  Not coming back.

Been here twice.. I LOVE IT.    We ordered the Papa K which was excellent.. the ham and cheese.. so savory, every bite i took in super slow.  I ordered it with a fried egg on top, which i recommend.  Also got the Turkey crepe which was even better! Flavors so good you don't want to spoil them with any kind of hot sauce or even salt and pepper!  Also their latte art is really good and cute =)

I was warned to go here.. so i stayed away, but i am thinking they thought it was still the previous restaurant.  My experience was great, the ordering system is pretty cool: you pick your soup base, noodles, and ingredients. try to order the basics, adding too much into your soup will complicate it.  oh and it comes with a drink, get the coffee.

After a great hike on Camelback on a windy Sunday, me and the roomie decided to grab brunch here.  First thing i ordered was a bloody mary because i saw someone with one (monkey see monkey do) and the bacon sticking out of it looked great!  So when i finally got mine, it had no bacon.. no celery either.. just an olive, a lime, and a lemon.. and it was super bright red.  The taste was not too bad, but definitely not what i had expected, i asked about it, and the server said i should have ordered a "bacon bloody mary" . oh well, my bad right?  So i did so for my second, and it was pretty good, except the bacon was old, like what you would find at the last 10 minutes of a bloody mary bar.   To eat, i ordered the chicken fried steak/hashbrowns/something stack, it sounded EPIC! like something from Hash House A GO GO!! But.. when it came, it was lacking, well.. everything, it looked sloppily put together, and was near flavorless.  I am so glad that they had a couple different hot sauces at every table, they are gonna need it.

Everything looked soooo good so we decided to put our shopping for Hello Kitty aside and grab a bite. I would call it a mistake, the juice drinks were not that tasty and some tasted downright odd, not horrible, just musty? Freezer burn'ish?. The spicy tamarind was just bleh, not even as fresh as the lollipops you get when you donate $.50 into one of those boxes at a restaurant to help the kids.  The elote in a cup wasn't bad though, a bit overpriced. I did want to like it, because I live down the street, but I will try my luck hanging out at the park instead.

Second time here, ordered a Greek Salad with Chicken Kabob.. the plate was so small i couldn't cut my chicken or even fork out the cheap iceberg lettuce without some falling on the table, chicken was way too saucy as well. Stick to a gyro, had that last time and it was golden. Seems like good people, they are nice.

My first time going, and i was not that hungry, so all i ordered was a few appetizers/sides.. but oh man this was great. I had a steak woodie and it was amazing, and the chicken slider was huge, my stomach and tastebuds were beyond satisfied.     Also as i was typing this i saw a review by "Andrew S" you insult us true Yelpers by saying good reviews are by friends of the owners, it may just be you that has no taste buds.. the flavorings are amazing.

Ran out of glazed donuts and offered no compensation for my drive.  Bad management decisions.

I was skeptical to try this place, due to the frequent owner changes.  We ordered the do it yourself bbq for lunch, and I have to say it is the best this building has had to offer.. I recommend the pork belly, bulgogi(beef) and the galbi(need short ribs). The ban chan (side dishes) were fresh and delightful. Would go again

"Where am i? Are we safe?"  Those were my first words after parking in the warehouse district looking parking lot.. they were re-uttered when i walked into the large double doors into what i thought was a garage.. but all was placed at ease when i saw the twinkling Christmas tree surrounded by flat panel televisions in the middle of the dining area.    I ordered the pickled pork belly appetizer, oh man, i think i will come here just for this, it is sooo good, spicy but not sooo spicy, and the texture and flavor are nothing you (non Chinese person reading this) has ever had.   My friend ordered the fried rice, which was pretty darn good! (i don't eat rice really)  For our main dish i got the Spicy Lamb Dry Hotpot, and oh em gee was it spicy, it was delicious, if you do order it, order so gai lan (chinese broccoli) or something to go with it, you will need it.   The only thing that upset me, is that due to customers not knowing what LOTUS ROOT is, they stopped using it in their hotpot and use bean sprouts which i am not a fan.

Not sure if what they are doing is legal: I like the music and the set up a lot, the bar tender decided to charge me $6 for a cup of water, she justified the charge as a "fill" and it wasn't that I was only ordering it alone, I ordered two mixed drinks and a beer along with it. Needless to say she did not get a tip.

Either my thirst is real or they accidentally spilled the salt container on the shawarma container before placing it in the heating dish. The spicy baba ganoush was good but the overly salty chicken forced me to ask for a side of regular hummus to balance the flavor. It wasn't too bad but the fact that I paid over $10 for a medium sized lunch and a pathetic salad makes me not want to come back, even with the yelp check in offer.

Going up, on a Tuesday! Taco Tuesday's here to be exact, but two items get one free, such an amazing deal! So yeah, they fried fish tacos are delicious, they come on a flour tortilla and you have an enormous selection of salsas and amazing slaw and other vegetables. Will update again on my fourth visit :)

New pho spot in Lee Lee market is much more than pho. Rice and noodle dishes are as good as ever, but the main attraction is the grilled food and the roll your own spring rolls with a grill at the table! Amazing, while your shopping and hungry, stop in.

where to start.. good, bad, or ugly?  First off, i am from the midwest, but i have lived in Arizona most of my life, Steak 'n Shake is my FAVORITE place to eat back home, this location... i will NOT go again (maybe) It has none of the charms like the original, no host(ess), no bar to sit and watch them smash your burger and cook it, only about 50% of the menu, no server to take your order and refill your dr pepper, no sauces sitting out for your food drowning pleasure, and no physical menus you can hold while you decide which tasty burger or dessert you want.. what there is though, are giant tv screens, a touchscreen soda machine, annoying music, and an awkward patio.    where was i.. covered bad and ugly.. oh yeah, the royale was tasty because #iloveegg, and the frisco melt was great too.  But i can get that anywhere, the ambiance sucked.

I saw photos from here on Instagram and FB, i was super excited to try their food. So one Saturday i decided to travel uptown to try it out, looked so cute and amazing from the outside, the tacky "asian" decor didn't turn me off one bit, neither did the upscale price tag for the food, but (there is always a but) the weird insanely tangy sauces and broth for the "soups" did.. i am not sure what the chefs were thinking, but these are not flavors meant for these dishes, at all..   i like "fusion" food as much as the next guy but the lamb pastrami bun tasted as they just saw one in a magazine and tried to match it without reading the ingredients.  kimchi fried rice, it was more of typical Chinese fried with clear kimchi thrown on top of it, which is "technically" kimchi fried rice, but not what it is supposed to be.  There was a sour element to it that is not found in Korean cuisine, that could just be due to the fusion.    up next we have the "ramen" .. uhm, if all you have had is Top Ramen, you may find this blend delightful or just amazingly odd, as for me, i enjoy my Japanese food, so this tangy mess was definitely a let down as well.  another one of us ordered some katsu thing, but that is not even worth describing, unless you have a sweet tooth.  the duck steamed bun was the only savior of the bunch, my only gripe was the bao was much too dense, and i ended up leaving half it on my plate, when usually that is the best part.   If the pricing wasn't so pretentious, i would have thought about giving this two stars.

I DON'T like Boiling Crab, Kickin' Crab, or Hot 'N Juicy.. So why did i try this place out? It was a friends birthday, ordered crab legs, mussels, clams, and shrimp and the flavor was good, like really good.. if someone says they didn't like the taste, just ask them which flavor they tried, there are more than several.  (personally i like kajun and trifecta SPICY) Costs a bit much though, but you already know that going in.  and get corn and the cajun fries, you won't be disappointed

Stopped in for lunch, the incredibly LARGE parking spaces in a small amount of space leads me to believe this place was either small inside or has horrible drivers for customers, once i entered i assume now it is the latter, a spacious dining room, bar, and outdoor seating available.  First off i ordered a horchata, which was the second best i have ever had, they put a good variety of fruits in there that perfectly complemented the flavor..   I then ordered some street tacos, and before they came out i walked up to the Salsa Bar.. oh man, i need more than just a spoon for this place, they have every flavor you would expect, and an delicious peanut salsa.. it was soo tasty i don't even know if the tacos themselves were any good, guess i gotta go back!

Food is good as always, but I am left wondering why the praise music is only instrumental versions when I sat down to have my lunch.. I was to hear lyrics, it's one of the reasons I dine there, helps me find my center.

Strictly reviewing as a restaurant.. This place is great, when I tell people some of my favorite tacos in Arizona are at El Hefe, they think I'm crazy. They have great choices and are reasonably priced on some days, but I go up on Tuesdays. My favorite is the duck taco, absolutely nothing wrong with it, texture, taste, and spices are on point.

Tried this little spot out once, yup, that's all it took, I'm hooked now. I don't even mind waiting.. As soon as the line starts to move in your favor and you enter the doorway, you are greeted with a sample of what will prove to be the tastiest meat you have ever put in your mouth.. The fatty brisket.. It's because that is what's always on the cutting board due to its popularity, so the owner happily hands out samples, feels like my first time, every time.  The smokiness of all the meats is amazing, the moistness is on fleek and I wouldn't want it any other way. While your there might as well grab a smoked sausage or some ribs too, all served with 3 sauces you can load up on if need be, and some bread. Whatever you do, don't forget to try the jalapeño cheddar grits, they compliment any craving for BBQ.  At least I think they are jalapeño cheddar, I don't know, I just eat them.  Disclaimer: I went one day after returning from Austin, Texas.. and this place sill wowed me.

New (second or temporary location) for this Cajun restaurant. Came to Mesa to try it out, we ordered the catfish dinner with crawfish sauce and a half poboy & cup of seafood gumbo. (All seafood due to Ash Wednesday, wish I made it here last night )  The crawfish étouffée atop the catfish was amazing, perfect texture and flavor, I then took a bite, crispy and spicy on the outside, moist and delicious on the inside.  I don't think i have had better (except blackened, blackened is better heh) .  The gumbo was great as well, the right amount of spice, i was so missing the andouille sausage, but lent.

A manager here once told me, they were patterned after Steak 'n Shake, I would believe it because it is delicious, the smashed burgers are crisped perfectly and the fries are as well.

I was weary about going here, i consider myself a connoisseur of hot pot, and i read peoples comments on IG posts, and they were not that great.  It reinforced my belief when i walked in and saw they had a sushi bar, a sushi bar at a Chinese hot pot place?  The decor was also Japanese which made me think it was a shabu shabu spot (which i do not like) but they had a Japanese BBQ grill which i wasn't mad at.  I ordered the spciy beef hotpot and she ordered the lamb, the lamb was not full of flavor but what it did have was richness, if you love lamb you don't usually want it overbearingly spicy in a soup. well, we don't at least (we had the cumin lamb as an appetizer for that) My hotpot on the other hand, was bursting with flavor, so much i ordered an extra side of enoki mushrooms to go with it, the spice level was perfect for a date (they told me i could get more spicy if i want next time)  and the best part was free ice cream at the end! we got the green tea, it wasn't that blah super sweet green tea you get from most sushi joints, it had a great base to it and finished off the meal perfectly.

Mark P. obviously hasn't been to this location because it is on Peoria and not Dunlap, but he did write an amazing story. Anyways this spot is like any other Chick Fil A, clean, courteous, and delicious. Though not many are as kind or "hook ups" friendly as Arrowhead or Go the extra mile to remove ONLY the onions from my chicken breakfast burrito as Deer Valley, this store meets my expectations as the best quality food quickly joint for a quick lunch bite, even with all the new choices in the area, it is still my go to place. I ordered my Chick Fil A sandwich "protein style" and they were very generous with the lettuce they wrapped it in, and are always happy to give you a LARGE ice water (unlike Canes who charges for any cup smaller than their little Dixies) here is the kicker, the protein style is actually cheaper than the regular sandwich! Love this place

Small joint in a developing area, I figured, "new spot, will have to work out the kinks."  No way, first visit was great, I was even "that guy" that walks in 4 minutes before closing (I honestly didn't know the hours SORRY) they did not mind, were jovial and fun to talk to.   I ordered the Korean chili chicken, (asian) slaw, with a sprinkles cake donut.  Was highly impressed, the chicken was fried to a nice crisp and it was sauced tossed to perfection as to not goo it up.  The flavor was on point, I frequent Korean chicken joints in LA and this is definitely up to par.  The donut was eaten bit by bit after each mouthful of the chicken followed by slaw each time to clear the palate.  They also were nice enough to throw in an extra donut on my way out, that i am saving for dessert after whatever i scrounge up in my kitchen tonight.

Banh mi? It's a Vietnamese take on French sandwiches, and let me tell you, they knock it out of the park. I like a banh mi as much as the next guy, but this restaurant, kills it. I've tried most of the items on the menu, nothing beats the BMB special (grilled pork with pâté with pickled daikon and carrots with TWO fries eggs!) and accompanied by either spring rolls or lotus root salad (large portions btw) and wash it all down with their famed cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee). Super friendly and helpful staff, you'll see what one taking about.

If you are into trying something new and tasty to the valley, and don't mind a little heat on your food, this place is for you.  I've had Korean fried chicken in several states and a couple other countries, but not here in AZ.  Was excited to learn we had one here, so I took a trip to the east valley to try it out.  Did not disappoint, we orders the padak chicken (even though I hate all types of onions that aren't fried in batter) and the garlic soy, both offerings were a bit of light crispy deliciousness in every bite. I see a lot of negative words because people aren't prepared for something other than a bucket of fried chicken, don't be discouraged by those. Also the fresh side of radish (daikon) made the meal complete, definitely going back soon.

Surprisingly good! I ordered the ramen with pork belly (sans green onions because taste) and the Bao Mi. The broth was tasty and not too salty and the pork belly was cooked crispy on the outside and soft and melts on the inside. I removed a few bean sprouts (personal preference) and added a little bit of the provided chili oil and fresh ground pepper and I was on my way, didn't stop until the girlfriend shoved one of the Brussels sprouts that came with the Bao Mi in my face, and it too was tasty.  Then bao itself has great flavor along with the sauce and meat, but a bit too doughy.. again personal preference. The lady got the pho with ribeye, broth was a bit thin but still decent, the ribeye was a bit thick of a meat than we are used too, maybe do some thin slices and it will blend in better. Will definitely go again soon!
