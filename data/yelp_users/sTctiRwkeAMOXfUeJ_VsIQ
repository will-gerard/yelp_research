I love this place. My little Charlie always looks so adorable and it's obvious the staff love what they do. Thank you for taking care of my baby!

Horrible service. Jason has a horrible rapport and rushed us through like a herd of cattle.  Food was less than average. Service even worse.

Went with a couple of girlfriends on Sunday night.  The music, fantastic however the service was not so!  One must mortgage their house to pay for the overpriced drinks that are in glasses so small they could pass as shot glasses.  Our server, rude is putting it mildly..  Samantha (Sam) was slow and rarely checked back with us as she spent most of her time chatting with her coworkers at the end of the bar.  I asked for Disaronno and she laughed with a sarcastic attitude and said she never heard of it.  She never offered to find out if they have it and asked what else could she get instead.  Every time we asked her a question she couldn't hear us because she was wearing earplugs.  Hmmm,  you're working at a place that offers live music, DUH. I'll be back for the music but will not be served by Sam.

Slow and horrible service.  40 mins to take our order and no silverware. This is not looking good.  Grrr

I was having issues with my iPhone battery and the service was amazing.  David spent a couple of hours assisting me and was willing to go the extra mile for me. I most definitely recommend this place for iPhone and iPad repairs. Thanks David!!

What a precious find!  I stopped in for a birthday gift and the staff were fabulous. The gentleman was knowledgable and helpful as I am not schooled so to speak regarding cigars. I would definitely recommend and will be returning for my Cigars 101.
