New year, new clothes, time to update my closet.  A great way to sell some clothes for cash is at Buffalo Exchange.  They give you 33% for the value of the clothes or 50% for in store credit.  The staffs are so friendly.  I just love the store that doesn't smell like something died like other consignment stores.

Thank you A for inviting me to dine at Coup Des Tartes.  I love that it was a BYOB place.  We were told that we only have 45 minutes to dine due to all tables were reserved. That means to eat quickly and dash out.   We seat in a little corner, but I can't help admiring the French elegant decor all around us.  We had ordered the Roquefort salad, mixed of organic greens, roasted apples, dried figs, toasted hazelnuts & Premier Cru Roquefort.  This was probably the best salad I had so far.  It was that GOOD!  We thought it was funny that they would have a dish named "Jose Pasta" at a French restaurant.  So we decided to give it a try.  It was linguine tossed in a chili garlic cream sauce with vegetables and parmigiano-reggiano. You can add chicken for $5 more.  The linguines were well cooked with light cream sauce and a little kick.  I think it's still missing something in the dish, but I'm not sure what.  It does go well with the wine.  According to the Waitress, the Chef had made the dish for himself one night, but the employees tried and liked, so now it's on the menu.  After the main course, we had ordered the Mocha Pecan Tarte.  It was a petite warm pecan tart with chocolate, Kahlua, and vanilla ice cream on the side.  This was not meant to be shared. Sorry, A! : )  Shortly after the dessert arrived, we didn't have much time to enjoy it.  We were told by one of the Waitresses that our time is almost up.  If you want to enjoy full French experience here make sure you have reservation.

I had to stop by during lunch to see what this place was about. They had 4 or 5 tables inside and 2 tables outside.  A large counter filled with different pastries/danishes/muffins/cookies/cakes/pies.  Another counter filled with different sandwich meats. I didn't order any sandwiches since I had ate, but still wanted a dessert to keep me through the day.  I wanted the Napoleon, but it was too big to finish.  So I had ordered a cheese danish instead.  The cheese danish was big for $1.60.  They do make their own breads. However at 1:30PM, there wasn't too much left.  They also sell European food items and goods.  I like to go back to try their polish plates, stuffed cabbage, and pierogi.

Beware being ripped off at Au Petit Four!  If only i can give no star, i would.  We dined late on a Saturday night. We were the only table in the restaurant.  The desserts were good, but very expensive- (1) coffee $2.00, (2) Arrowhead water $2.00, (1) Lorina lemonade $3.50, (1) mango mousse cake, (2) Creme brûlées, (1) chocolate chip cookie, (1) white cake, all total to $48.50.  It was an indication when there were no price tags for the desserts.  The owner didn't even give us an actual bill, but just came by to tell us the total.  We were all pretty tired and didn't give too much thought of the amounts. I am extremely disappointed, SHAME ON YOU AU PETIT FOUR!

I have bought new tires and was referred by Discount Tires to have an alignment done.  The service took little over an hour on a Friday afternoon.  I was glad there was a Dairy Queen next to the shop.  They have limited seats in waiting area, especially on a busy day.  The time just flew by while I was enjoying my favorite treats.     When I returned to pick up my car, I was ready to pay for the $49.99 alignment.  Adam explained that I didn't need the alignment, and was no charge for the service.  He showed me the print out and the wheels were aligned.  This is one shop that do follow their slogan "affordable - honest - friendly"!  They also have coupons to print on their website.

We went during the St. George Feast of the Middle East in early October. This church was a great place to have the celebration. Parking gets to be a challenge, but do have parking lots in the front and back of the church as well street parking. It was still a well-organized event.   Food and drink tickets purchased inside the banquet room. There were tables set up inside and outside. Loud traditional music blasted through the speakers and performances inside the banquet room. The crowds were cheering, singing, and dancing. They sure know how to throw one hell of a party. It was so much fun to watch.   The aroma of Middle Eastern spices will lead you to a large tent set up outside to order the food. I believe it was $1 a ticket. A plate was $10+ without drink.  Another tent was set up for drink orders.  I ordered the chicken shawarma plate included a side selection. It was good, but I had better. Kabob and vegetarian plate thumbs up according to my friends. The portion sizes were decent for what you paid. We ended with a few extra tickets and headed to the long dessert tables set up inside the banquet room. There were so many authentic Lebanese assortment selections. The Baklawas had at least four different trays. I wish I remember the name of the bakery.    For the kiddos, the church school playground opened for them to play as well as plenty of inflatable bounce houses for them to burn off all that energy.  Face painting for donation plus shaved ice and caramel popcorn for $1 or $2. The church gift shop was opened all day to shop. A visit to this festival will leave you enriched in the history and culture.

We had about a group of 20 celebrating early Cinco de Mayo. This is a great place for large groups. They have a few separate dining areas.    I had the chicken chimichanga with green chile sauce plate. The potion size was decent.  I thought the green chile sauce just wasn't enough on the chimichange.  No sour cream and guac came with the plate. I don't mind paying for them if the server offered. It wouldn't be a Cinco de Mayo celebration without margaritas. The ladies ordered strawberry and classic frozen margaritas while the boys got beers. If you are a light weight with the alcohol consider sharing the margarita.      At least they still give complimentary chips & salsa plus sopapilla for dessert.  They bring you both sopapilla in plain and cinnamon sugar.  Made hot and fresh!  It's messy, but so worth it!

After a long afternoon lying by the pool, hungry, looking for happy hour deals, we found Hiro Sushi in N. Scottsdale.  No happy hour here, but they offer high quality Japanese food at an affordable price. My favorite was the tempura dish. It was perfectly fried and so crispy.  You can taste that they used clean oil to fry, not like other restaurants.  The sushi rolls were very fresh and well prepared. This is my new favorite Japanese restaurant in N. Scottsdale.

I watched Daddy Long Legs about two weeks ago.   The story was so heartwarming, beautiful, and romantic, as if you are watching a Jane Austen's novel coming to live.    The two actors were magnificent.  I hope they will return back to ATC.  There is not a bad in seat in the house at The Herberger Theater.  A major plus is that you get in/out of ladies room during intermissions before the performance starts again.   Thank you all for a fantastic evening!

$35 buy you black beans clams, steam fish topped with shredded ginger, ginger & onion lobster, and no charge on rice!  You might find this type of deal in New York, Cali or Chicago, rarely in Arizona.       I felt I grew up with this restaurant.   My family has been coming here for years.  It has been so many years that I have back.   I was really impressed with the consistency of the dishes.  Everything still tasted delicious.  If you want authentic Chinese food, do not order from the regular menu; ask for the Chinese one with English translation.  You will not be disappointed!   The clay pot beef tendon/stew (the gravy goes well with other dishes if you don't like the meat) and pea seedling/Dou Miao with garlic sauce are a must try.  *** Note*** Go here knowing that you'll get good and affordable food, but find the service and ambiance lacking.

I was not impressed by the long wait to see a doctor.  Unless you are dying, you will be expected to wait at least 4 hours or more.  They have a nurse to check you first, and then you're directed to wait in the reception area.  After 2 hours, you get to sit inside the room to wait for a doctor. 2 more hours gone by, the doctor finally came.  They really need to take "Urgent" out of their name.  The only plus is that they do friendly staffs.

I went during lunch for their annual "Free Omelette Day ", and to support St.Vincent De Paul.   I was surprised there wasn't a long line.  You get to choose any omelets on the menu.  Holly, my waitress was super friendly.  I had ordered the Bacado omelet, which filled with bacon, avocado, melted Monterey jack cheese, along with housemade salsa.   I thought the English toast was a little oily.  I don't know if it was butter or something else.   I usually like drinking stronger coffee, but the blend they had was pretty good.  It wasn't strong or too light.   The food came quickly and hot.  Ambiance is not much, but overall a pleasant experience.

I had craved for some greasy and fried foods.  I figured since I have a coupon and it was near my work; let's give SteakenBurger/Long Wongs a try. The joint is simple with two TV's on the wall and good amount of tables for the lunch crowd.  It wasn't crowded at 1PM.  It's probably never crowded.  I had ordered a combo regular original philly steak + mushrooms with Cheez Whiz ($7.24) with sub for mushroom ($1.75 extra) instead of fries, and small drink ($1.75).  I didn't get my mushroom, but got zucchini instead.  I didn't realize that they gave me zucchini until I took a bite.  As for the sandwich, no flavor at all, just the Cheez Whiz dripping all over.  I do give them having good ice teas.  The total of my combo was little over $11.00 with tax.  Ouch!  I am glad that I had a coupon to use.  I certainly had better philly steak sandwiches for that price.

As bookstores are closing, I hope B&N remains open.   A great place to browse around, but it can be pretty busy during summertime.  One thing I do not get is having a Starbucks inside the bookstore that do accept any gift cards.   It is still money.

No egg roll for you! I thought it was hilarious when I first visited. There was a sign on the door, no egg roll, no general chicken, no sweet sour pork, and no orange chicken. Customers are trying to order egg rolls and they kept tell them no egg rolls here.  The name alone is totally American-Chinese style food as what I would expect. I first heard of the restaurant was from an article voted as one of the best Chinese restaurant in America. Seriously! I got to find it out myself.   I dined second time around during dinner time on Father's Day. I hesitated to come again since parking spaces were so limited last time. The small parking lot is shared with other businesses too.   I mainly grew up eating Cantonese food. I love trying different non-Cantonese cuisines. As Andrew Zimmern's would say "be a traveler, not a tourist".   We ordered so much food. I only recalled just a few:  Shaanxi Pan-Fried Noodles - I love pan-fried noodles with a slight char. It was savory but greasy.    House sandwich - it was ok for me. All I tasted was mostly spicy Sichuan and chili peppers. I found the Shaanxi sandwich with pork more flavorful.    House Biang Biang Noodles: hot oil noodles = hot burn. If you can't handle the heat, don't even think about eating it. This can be a good hangover dish. It was so greasy.   Lamb Kebab: I don't normally eat lamb. There were so many different unique spices in kebab. It smelled great and tasted just like chicken.   Jelly fish - stay away from this, not fresh.   Stir fry with garlic - the vegetable of the day was really fresh. Just a tip, always ask the server what is the fresh vegetable of day is.

Craving for a soda not in can, but in a bottle, you must come here.   They have all sorts of different soda, root beer, cream soda, retro soda, and even international soda.  Prices were not the best, but they do offer various selection.  Excellent place to stuff a gift basket!

Thanks Lindsey and Yelp for giving me the opportunity to watch this performance.  My Niece couldn't stop talking about it the next morning.  I must agreed with Aileen, and Lynn with Gaston's multifunctional mic.  I thought it was just my ears. As for bathroom issue,  the line was so long that I was about to go into the men's bathroom.  I keep hearing 10 minutes until the show starts, then 5 minutes, and still standing in line.  We had to run back on the side of the auditorium afraid that they won't let us inside.  My poor Niece didn't want to miss any part of it.  Overall,  it was a wonderful night.  I got to meet more Yelpers, and made a memorable 1st Broadway show experience for my Niece.

I finally watched Fiddler on the Roof on their opening night.  What a beautiful treat!  I have wanted to watch this production for awhile, but always missed them when they are in town.  They are only performing in ASU Gammage until April 3rd.   I must give a huge THANK YOU to Lindsey and Yelp for the tickets.     Fiddler on the Roof was funny and touching tale about tradition, community, love and family.   Both the music and dancing were fabulous.  They gave us an intriguing insight of everyday life in a Jewish family during 1905.   It was a very enlightening production.    The quality of the actors were phenomenal, especially the main character Tevye played by  John Preece.   He was brilliant and hilarious!    I have watched few productions at ASU Gammage.   I love ASU Gammage, however the lack of restroom stalls in the ladies room really need some major improvements.   There is absolutely not enough time to go back to your seat.

What a wonderful little place to have a birthday lunch.  I enjoyed everything about this place. The location, owners, and of course the homemade food.  We started with a Pierogi Platter (1 doz), three different types: potato-cheese with smoked kielbasa saute with onions, meat, and sauerkraut.  I love the meat and potato-cheese, not so much of the sauerkraut ones.  I ordered a smoked polish sausage on cibatta bread , so yummy!  As for my friends, they had a fresh mozzarella, basil & tomato on cibatta,  hunter stew, cabbage roll, and breaded chicken breast  cutlet & cheese on cibatta bread.  I will need to go back to try the cheese blintzes.  Another plus about this place was   B.Y.O.B. - (beer or wine only)..  This was certainly a hidden a gem in downtown Glendale!

After all these years, I finally came and tried this establishment.  The parking spaces were limited.  Watch where you park!     A long line was already out the door waiting for a table. Why are brunch places always so busy?  The decor reminded me of Glendale's antique shops. They have a bunch of baskets hanging and other random items surrounded the restaurant. Its interesting decor.   Upon entering the restaurant, there was a strong burnt odor in the dining area.  I'm assuming their vents weren't working.   I had the Country Breakfast with 2 eggs, biscuits & gravy, and fried potatoes. The biscuits & gravy didn't taste fresh and homemade. Fried potatoes were basically scorched.  They were tasteless and hard.  It helped when you sprinkle with plenty of black peppers.  The staff was efficient and friendly.  I love a place still give out free warm muffins. I would return just to order the basket of muffins. It was absolutely delicious.

Dined late night at AZ88 wanted soup, but ended with dessert and salad.  I had a key lime tart, which was a bit too acidic for me.  The size portion was great perfect for sharing.   My friend had the Four Seasons salad came with choice of two dressings, balsamic vinaigrette and fat-free raspberry vinaigrette.   The fat-free raspberry blended together nicely with the bitterness of the spouts in the salad.   The service can be sort of slow.  The atmosphere in the courtyard is still great, but the food and value has gotten a lot worse...

Best place to recycle unwanted stuff for cash or store credit.  They have a huge selection of books, cds dvds, books, games, records, videos, even old school toys.  I couldn't stop laughing when I saw a set of N'SYNC dolls, but was missing JT.  Hmmm...  They have free WIFI!

This strip mall is probably the busiest corner among the rest.  It has few of my favorite places in the same plaza,  Changing Hands, Trader Joe's, Express MiE, and Wildflower Breads.  I love Changing Hands for their book events, authors signings, amazing selection of bargain books, and other fun gift items. I wish I live a little closer...

This place gets really busy even on a Thursday night.  The line was out the door. We decided to do the to-go route, and seat outside so the kids can run around.  It was my Sister's B-Day, which got a free meal ($12.00 value.) anything off the menu.     BBQ ribs were tender and tasty. Hot Link Sausage Must have! Chicken Breast - Save money and order more ribs! Cheesy Potatoes - YUM! Turkey Jalapeno Sausage - Not recommended - save your money and order more Hot Links Sausages.   Unlimited sauces!!!!

Just the smell of the bakery when you walk in makes your mouth water and aim for the counters.   I have passed by too many times and finally had stopped in after the Tempe Heart Walk.  The restaurant was packed with lunch-goers.  I am glad that they actually have a to-go line.  The menu offers breakfast, lunch, and pastries, but it's the pastries I'm after today.  I went straight for their famous macarons.   The vanilla bean macaron was so delightful.  The texture was light and creamy. The macaron wasn't enough so I had ordered the Small Box of Treats (mini macaron, strawberry tart, key lime tart, and a cookie), almond croissant, and a brioche roll.  After opening the boxes and bags, I completely forgot to take any photos.  Who can blame me?  I will need to return to try their crepes and other desserts.

Oh, how I missed the tofu soup and bulgogi combo in this cold weather.  The best combo deal you will find in a Korean Restaurant.  They have excellent dishes that will warm your body and your tummy.   My other favorites are bibmbap in the hot stone pot,  Korean BBQ, Chap Chae,  Sul Lung Tang, Mandoo Gook, Katsu plate (huge), and seafood pancake ( it should be an entree instead of an appetizer).  They offer excellent lunch specials for less than $6.00.

I needed some TLC on my crazy brows. I am very particular with my brows especially at a new location.  There are only a few that can really manage it.  After reading many Yelp reviews, I took my chance at J'adore. One-stop shopping, mani/pedi, full salon, and unique piece of jewelry.  Eyebrow waxing is only $10.  This place is clean and open later than other salons.  The sad part is that I don't remember the name of the lady who worked on my brows.  I hope she is still there the next time I visit.

You can smell of the sizzling fajitas from outside of the restaurant.  I have stopped by around 12PM expecting a very long line, but it wasn't as bad as I thought.  I had ordered 1 pound of top sirloin and 1 pound of beef fajitas.  I figured that might not be enough to feed 4, so added a super quesadillas.   The fajitas were juicy, savory, and accompanied with handmade tortillas.  They have a pretty impressive salsa bar.   A huge selection of flavorful salsa's range of spice levels, fresh guacamole, large jalapenos, and salted fishes.  The chips were very good, freshly made and warm.   I had waited at least 25 minutes before getting my order.  I definitly will call ahead next time.

Must say, I was looking forward to try this place when I first passed by it.  It is located in downtown Glendale.  It's a little house serving soul food.  I love eating soul food, but now I have to be more cautious when eating it.  I had ordered the shrimp po-boy sandwich, which I got really sick after eating due to the shrimp undercooked (WARNING, IF THE SHRIMP LOOKED AND TASTED RAW, ITS DEFINITELY NOT DONE, AND IT IS NOT THE MARINATE!).  The reason I didn't return my dish was that we're the only table and waited a while for our foods to come. My friend had the Chicken Fried Steak, which was delicious.  Corn bread was good, chicken and waffle was just ok.  Lolo's is still better.  The owner was really nice, but unfortunately food poisoning wasn't pleasant at all.

Giselle is one of the most classical ballets of all time.  I was so excited to receive my ticket for CMYE Opening Night of Giselle last week.    I had seat in the top area, but were able to see and hear the performance.  The costumes were so exquisite, and the beautiful stage production was so well thought out.  The dancers and orchestra were magnificent!   This is one performance you do not want to miss.   Thank you so much for Lindsey and Symphony Hall for an unforgettable evening!

It was a perfect day to sit outside in the patio enjoying the Bacon & BBQ sauce cupcake from the Food Network "Cupcake War" Challenge.  The thought of BBQ sauce on a cupcake doesn't sound very appealing, but surprisingly it wasn't too bad.  Joe's BBQ sauces are good by itself.  The cupcake was moist and with some unique flavors.  I just couldn't resist not trying it.   The view of the farm was gorgeous too.

Last month, I attended the Dine Out for Life night at Switch.  They generously donated 100% of the profit for that night to this event.   As you can image, it was a very busy night.  This was my first time here.  I have heard that they have amazing Happy Hour specials so I arrived early.  I didn't have a reservation, but the Hostess was nice to let us dine.  Tim, our waiter was outstanding!  Decor is really lovely but most importantly the food and drinks were really excellent!!  I had both the Blond (white wine) and Red (red wine) Switch Sangrias.   I like the Red over the Blond.  The alcohol kick of the red wine was stronger and fruitier.   I had the Crispy Iowa Pork sandwich.  The pork loin cutlet was fried in perfection.  You can taste the grain mustard in every bite.  Yum!   All sandwiches accompany with a Caesar salad.  For the price you can't beat the overall experience at this restaurant.

Happy Hour plus a free concert, think the AZ State Fair.  If you go on Fridays before 6PM, they offer $1 food item(s) per a booth, $1 per game, and $1 ride.  Not a bad deal!   They have $5.00 parking if you park at 18th Ave and Encanto at the golf course parking lot.  Admission was 1/2 off.  The best $1.00 deal was the Indian fried bread with powder sugar for me.  If you do go on a Friday, I suggest start from the food row near the McDowell Rd. & 19th Ave entrance.  They have better discounted food items and cheaper drinks.  To finish off with the night, I got to watch Colbie Caillat for free with great seats.  I might need go back to try their fried butter.  Anyone tried that yet?

6 of us arrived early for a surprised birthday bash.  It was pouring rain as we drove from the west valley.  We barely walked in and greeted our friends, we were told to go sit down.  I thought there was a special room set up for us.  We didn't even have a chance to pick out a color yet.  Are you going to bring us all the colors to pick?  What is the freaking rush!  I know you are busy, but we are your clients now show some customer service respects. So RUDE!        After we all took our seat at the pedi stations, I noticed most of the Techs seem to be unhappy.  Was it too early or was it the rain?  I went with the $30 Pink Polish Pedi.  My Tech was silent the whole time.  There wasn't even a smile, I was getting a little nervous.  Would it be the lack of English, or just not in the mood to talk?   She didn't even offer the types of polish they had until I over heard my friend's Tech.  I still wonder what type of polish I would get if I didn't ask.    I wish I can give it more stars, but for the $30 pedi treatment I would have a live person doing massage and not just a chair massage.

I'm assuming everyone was there for the Smart Shopper deal for 1/2 off menu items excluded the drinks and desserts.  It was a busy Friday night.  We seat by the open kitchen.  Every dish looked and smelled so good.  We got to watch the Suns vs. Lakers game on nice big screen TV.  The kids enjoyed the Chefs cooking, especially when the pans were on fire.  I had tried their White Wine Flight (InfmGoose  - Sauvignon Blac, New Age White, and NapaCreek Chard) - $9.00.  I like the flight, however the New Age White was over ice, and it was sort of diluted.  I'm glad that we ordered the appetizers crab cakes and soup/salad.  The clam chowder was full with crabs, so worth the $2.00 add-on to your meal.  I think they forgot us after the appetizers.  Our food took a while to arrive.  After sitting for about 15-20 minutes, our food finally arrived.  I had ordered the Four Seasons pizza that came with 2 slices of the seafood (scallop/shrimp), margherita, mushroom & plum tomatoes, and prosciutto with shaved parmesan.  The seafood pizza needs cheese and sauce.  It was basically scallop and shrimp on a pita bread.  The rest of the pizza was just OK. They do have excellent paste dishes.   My friends had the Seafood Manicotti, Linguini with clam, and another pasta dish, which I can't remember the name.  They were all phenomenal.  The Chicken Marsala was a bit dry.  As the weather cools, they have a great patio area to unwind.

I am not a big fish  fan, but do like to eat the sushi rolls.  I have been to Teharu Sushi a few times.  The staffs were friendly.  Prices are responsible, Happy Hour prices.  However,  the fish quality was not fresh according to my friends, which know sushi.  Arizona  needs more conveyor-belt style sushi restaurants  .

I went to Christopher's for Happy Hour on a Thursday night.  We sat at the counter area by the open kitchen.  The advantage sitting by the kitchen is that you get to sample food from the Chef.  Can't beat that!  They have a good selection of pizzas, flatbreads, wines on their HH menu.  I had the Wild Mushrooms Shallots & Arugula, which normally is $16 but its $8.  You get a full pizza loaded with arugula and mushrooms.  Pizza was on a thin crust and crunchy. The sweet potato fries needed dipping sauce.  It was good, but tasted that it has been sitting in the heat lamp.   The service is sincere and friendly, but can be slow at times.  Christopher's is a very charming place for those looking for an eclectic experience.

We had a big lunch and just wanted some appetizers.  I think the menu got a little longer since last time I went to Chili's.  It was a cold night so everyone ordered the Chicken Enchilada Soup.  This soup way too salty for my taste.  Apps were the typical bar food.  The service was really lacking that night.  There are so many nicer restaurants around this area.  I usually enjoy Chili's restaurant, but this one was at the bottom of my list.

We were there for dinner on a Friday night.  It doesn't seem too busy.  We had waited at least 15 minutes before being seated.  The staffs were friendly especially if you're Korean, which we're not. .  The side dishes were small.   The foods took too long to be served. They had never asked if we wanted water.  Tea was served, but no refills.    Price: High Food: Average, but had better Korean food Service: Average

The McDowell Sonoran Preserve is easy and beautiful to hike.  There are some steep inclines and declines on uneven loose rocks on the trail.  Breathtaking views and worth every ounce of sweat...  A major plus is that you don't need to fight for a parking space.  Happy hiking!

If you love popcorn, this is the place for you.  They offer endless flavors of kettle popcorn.  I love the Butter Pecan, Pineapple/Jalapeno, and Caramel.  The owners and staffs are knowledgeable and very friendly.  Excellent gift idea for someone that is hard to buy.  They have smaller sampler sizes great for gift basket. The medium bag popcorn on Tuesdays is only $2.00, normally $3.00.

I have rented a Toyota Sienna through Costco and picked up at this location.  No pressure or hassle to add-on insurance.  It was quick and easy!   If you are a Costco member, the second driver is free.  This is the best rental car place I have encountered.  The Manger is really friendly.  The van was clean and almost new.  I will definitely rent from this location again.

Gallo Blanco is a hip restaurant with contemporary decor.  It is located inside the Clarendon Hotel.   The service was fantastic and the food was delicious. This a great place to bring visitors truly sample great Southwest style cuisine.

A little late to review the Caramelapalooza at Smeeks Candy Shop event on 3/26, but here it is.  The setting was an outside packing lot, a row of peeps waiting to try the different caramels.  The line was long and moving really slow.  The contestants were Honey Moon Sweets, Wicked Kitchen Gourmet, BOURBON STEAK at the Fairmont Scottsdale Resort, Urban Cookies, Tammie Coe, Tracy Dempsey, Urban Beans, Sweet Republic, and Whimsical Candy Whimsical Candy.  We got to vote for the best caramel candy.  I voted for the beer & pretzel caramel from Wicked Kitchen.  I didn't really taste the beer, but they were chewy and all caramel inside.  By the time we make it toward the front, most of the caramels were gone.  I wanted to try the bacon brittle and caramels from Sweet Republic, which sounded very interesting. After the event, we went inside Smeeks to fill our brown lunch bag.  This place sure brought back so many childhood memories.  My favorites were the lunch boxes, gag candy gifts, and many, many retro candies. I love this store. I hope they stick around for a while.

All you need to remember is one name, AMY HORN! I bought a Groupon for a cut and partial highlight. As I expected, it was a mad house that Saturday afternoon people and stylists everywhere. Good thing there were plenty of snacks and drinks nearby the reception counter.  I was starving since I skipped lunch.    This was my first visit with Amy. I knew I was going to have an awesome experience just by her welcoming cheerful smile. She gave me great suggestions of mixing different colors for the highlight to blend in with my dark black hair. During the conditioning and drying process, she constantly checked on me. Superb customer service! She even offered me the same Groupon price if I come back to see her next time. I guess it is that time again to give her a call.

I am little late to review this, but better now than never.   I had a fun time attending the first Yelp AZ International Supper Club at Pho Thanh.   It was a perfect pick by Gabi as I was really craving for Vietnamese food that night.  I had ordered the Bun Bi Cha Gio (vermicelli with eggrolls, seasoned shredded pork, vegetables, crushed peanuts and fish sauce).  This is the best noodle dish especially when outside is so hot!   It will definitely cool you off.   I also had the whole young coconut.  The coconut juice and the meat were so fresh.  You might need to have some serious elbow grease to remove the meat inside the coconut.  I would warn the people sitting around in case you hit them.  Sorry to be so critical but I was so excited to have a "Vietnamese" restaurant in the 'hood.

This was not my first experience at Golden Spoon.  I had tried a few times at their Chandler location.  They never disappoint.  It was the Scottsdale location's Grand Opening weekend offering free yogurt.  Nothing beats FREE!  I like their Raspberry Cheesecake and Pistachio. I had sampled the Pomegranate Blueberry , didn't like it.  It sounded good, but tasted very sour.  Their yogurts are creamer than Yogurtland, Ocean Blue, and Mojo.

I'm addicted to this place. They have so many stylish clothes and excellent bargains.  This place is so much better than Forever 21.  The kid clothes are so cute.  I can't wait for them to open the second location closer to my house.

After dinner, we wanted to sit and have a few drinks.  We stumbled into The Compound Grill.  They were charging a $5.00 cover fee that night, but the bouncer guy was nice to let us in at no cover.   The Ray Johnston Band was playing very awesome music.  We sat outside in the patio enjoying the cool weather.  A friend had ordered the Compound Quesadilla.  The quesadilla dip was melted with Monterey jack cheese and generous potion of green chili.   It was sooooooo good!  The staff was attentive and made us feel very comfortable and relaxed.  We even received a sampler CD for the upcoming McDowell Mountain Music Festival.  They have fried green tomatoes here, anyone try it yet?

It is not your Vegas buffet, but you can find a tour of Asia in this west side strip mall sampling cuisine from Japan, Thai, Chinese, and Korean.  We had a party of 13 which took up 1/2 of the restaurant.  I had ordered the cha jang myun (black bean sauce with noodles) and sweet and sour pork.  It is not the typical Chinese version of sweet and sour pork.   The rest of party had ordered Kalbi, sul lung tang (a hearty, luxuriant beef broth made from ox bones), and champong (hot spicy noodle).    The dishes were huge.  I think I over ate, but it was just so good.  Our server was great and she thought of everything before we thought of requesting extra plates for our birthday cake.    They were very accommodating for a large group.  It's a great place I will definitely go back.

Another Chinese buffet taken over Country or Hometown Buffets. I heard good reviews about this place.  $12.99 per adult was reasonable price, food selections were good, and they even have a BBQ and noodle station for wonton noodle soup, beef stew soup, seafood noodle soup, roast duck noodle soup.  If you go to a Chinese restaurant and order three of these soups, that would cost you more than $12.99.  I'm always afraid of eating sushi at a buffet place.  They are never fresh and probably sitting there for hours. I was impressed with the Calirolls.  They actually have fresh avocados on top.  The deep fried rolls were probably fried a few times. It was tough, not crunchy at all.  If you're a fan of seafood, there are plenty of different seafood dishes to select from.  Speaking of buffets, my brother had mentioned Todai buffet.  I sure missed that place in the valley.  They have so much more to offer.

The best service I have gotten from a school so far.  I had a first- year student, but she did a great job.  It was graduation night so the place was pretty loud and fun.  As I watched the graduation of proud students and teachers, I was having my haircut.  It was pretty entertaining. The price was already cheap for $8.00, but my Stylist recalled if you're a new client you get additional 30% discount. That came to $6.40 for the haircut and $4.50 for the wax. Awesome!  After the haircut, I had a brow wax.  Unfortunately, I was her first client wax.  She needs a little more practice on this. When it was time to pay, the Receptionist wasn't aware of the 30% discount, and insisted there was no longer a discount offer for new client.  My Stylist had recalled in her class that 30% was still good, so she went to confirm with an Instructor.  Now, that is how you dazzle your customer!

What great place for coffee and desserts. The caramel fondue was so delicious, and couldn't get enough of the chocolate ganache crepe.  The restaurant is set as you are in the Swiss Alp.  The bathroom continues with the theme.  The service was excellent.  I think that the owner must love moo moo's. I need to go back to try the dinner menu.

It was anniversary night at Chick-Fil-A offering free movie (Finding Nemo), popcorn, face painting, balloons, cupcakes, and FREE chicken sandwich with any purchase.  It was a fun night with my Niece and celebrating with Chick-Fil-A. I've always loved anything I've had from here.

I am happy to hear that a ramen noodle place opened in valley.  I love eating ramen noodles when I was in Cali.  At first driving into the plaza, it bring back the days when I attended ASU.  This location used to be billiard place. It was definitely a college hangout, still is.  The space of the restaurant is huge.  They divided portion of the restaurant with a Boba bar.  I thought it was pretty neat.  I didn't try the Boba drink, but my friend did.  I can't remember what she had, but the drink was too watery and too sweet, according to her.  The menu selection is small.  I had ordered their house ramen, Republic Ramen.  It was supposed to be mild, but of course it came out with a kick.  You get two or three charsiu porks, so call veggies (lot of scallions) lack of spinach, and sprouts.  I think they forgot to put in the sprouts.   The soup base was spicy.  That was it!  The soup was very bland.  Was it worth the $6.95 for a bowl of ramen?  Not really!  Would I go back? Yeah probably so, the restaurant can fit a large crowd; friendly staffs, and good mid location (Tempe).

I have been trying to find other Taiwanese restaurants, and finally saw this place in an Asian Newspaper.  The menu has a good selection of ramen noodle soups, mini authentic Taiwanese dishes, and of Boba drinks.  I had ordered the Nanchatte Ramen , Almond Milk Tea & Green Milk Tea, and beef Wrap W/green Onion Pancake. The ramen was just ok;it is better than Ramen Noodle House.  The beef wrap w/green onion pancake was small for the price.  I had better beef wraps.  The best was the Boba teas.  It wasn't overly sweet, it was PERFECT!   The service was excellent.

Finally, an authentic Asian noodle house in town, I really hope they stick around for a long time.  I wouldn't see any problem if the line of people continue standing out the door waiting for a table on a Saturday night.  I had ordered their pan fried dumplings, but somehow they came out steamed. I had to request to take it back.  I normally don't like to refuse food; you never know what you end up.   As for the noodle dishes, the shaved noodles were okay, it wasn't what I expected.  I was thinking of thinker noodle in ball shapes instead of long strips.  It was sort of difficult to eat.  The beef noodle with lemon topped with garlic was delicious according to my Sis-in-Law.  It just doesn't look like an Asian dish.  The noodle with Minced Pork was the best.  However, I wish they had cut the noodles so it would be easier to pull by using the chopstick.  The beef tripe noodle soup wasn't bad either.  One thing is that they actually ran out of wontons.  WHAT?  Wonton and noodle are like bacon and egg.  How can you run out at a noodle house?  As for the service, we had friendly waitress, but very forgetful.  If you want to sit and enjoy a long meal, don't come on a Saturday night.  I felt the wait staff was rushing us out after we paid.  I know there are people waiting, but you can't rush people out like we didn't pay.  I didn't even get to finish my dumplings.  Boo Hoo!  I thought the guy making the noodles deserve more tips as he was entertaining the kids. Great babysitter as the parent dines.

Nobu offers Japanese fusion cuisine in an elegant modern but yet traditional Japanese setting.  There were numerous courses of beautifully prepared and imaginatively presented food on small plates the standard Japanese Isakaya (tapas).  My favorites were teeter tots which were absolutely incredible.  The spicy miso sauce was very addictive, and fried tofu with green onions on top is excellent.   The soft shell crab sandwich was good, but I think I like it more in a sushi roll.  As for dessert, after seeing everyone's order, I just couldn't resist not to order one for myself.  I have ordered the Orange-almond fritters, the smell of the orange in the warm fritters are splendid, and tasted even better.  The exotic flavor of the jasmine tea ice cream was very refreshing; just wish they have another scoop on it.   I took the pork belly buns home, and tried the next day. The braised pork belly buns with preserved mustard cabbage vegetable remained me of a Chinese-style dish that my dad loves.  Actually, I preferred something different than the fatty pork belly in the bun.  I just don't like the texture of the fatty part of the meat.    Overall, I had a superb UYE dinner at Nobu.  I am glad that they participated in Yelp Eats Week.   I hope they will be back for next Yelp Eats Week.  Thanks so much for organizing this, Lindsey!

There aren't many places to eat Swedish food; I am delighted that Beaver Choice has chosen Tempe as their home.  We arrived at Beaver Choice before 6:30PM on a Friday night.  While waiting for our table, we decided to order our food first.  I had ordered the chicken cordon bleu schnitzel.   My friends had the Kottbullar (Swedish meatballs), pork schnitzel, and angus burger.  After sitting at our table for over an hour patiently waiting for our food, we noticed a large group came after us had all their food served.   We started to wonder when our food will come out.   The owner's son ensured us that it will be out soon.  After another 30 minutes had gone by, the owner came out to apologize that our ticket got stick in the back of the large group.  As a consolation we were offered the Quebec Poutine on the house.  We were starving by now.   The Quebac Poutine is french fries topped with cheese curds and hot beef gravy - so yummy.  We finished that quickly.  When the food finally arrived, my chicken cordon bleu schnitzel was big, very juicy, crispy, and all the sides were delicious.   The meatballs were savory and well-accompanied by mashed potatoes and lingonberry preserves.  This is no Ikea frozen meatballs!  Unfortunately, my friend's angus burger came out rare.  She had to send it back to the kitchen and wait again.   The owner was nice enough to put this on the house as well.  We were all so full, but just couldn't resist ordering some desserts to take home.  We ordered almost one of each item from the dessert counter from Beaver Supreme, butter cookies, beaver balls (it's not what you think.), and cream puffs.   Although, it wasn't the best first time experience, overall the food was fantastic and affordable.  Europeans know what a proper portion size is!

Club 910 Live hosted the 1st "Brazilian Day Arizona" event in Tempe.  The music, live performances, and all the friendly people made it a remarkable evening.  If they continue with the event at this location, they need a stage platform for the performances.  You can't see anything if you're in the back.    The foods were catered by Val's Brazilian Cuisine.  I had to try everything.  The best were the roasted chicken stew plate with rice and salad ($8.00) and coxina  ($3.00 a piece).  I had ordered a chicken empanada somehow the inside was empty.   I guess returning was not an option.  The line was extremely long.  Two items I would steer clear of are the Bobo de camaro -combination of shrimp and mashed yucca ($3) and an item shaped like a meatloaf ($3).  The admission was $15.00, not including food or drink.  Parking was completely full by 8:30PM, the event started at 8PM.  After a night of drinking and dancing, we headed to iHop to sober up!

After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita.    I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions.  The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings.  The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce  has a nice tang to it.  It tasted light, cool, and creamy.   The total cost was $5.74 + tax.  I left with a very happy belly.

It was definitely a pleasant surprise the first time ventured into Tryst Cafe.  Everything was so fresh, delicious, perfectly cooked, and the portions were substantial.   The restaurant has very spacious, wide open layout with trendy tables/seating in the patio area.   If you are at Desert Ridge, skip the chain restaurants, and head over to Tryst Cafe instead!     - Hummus Trio (traditional, cilantro, and red pepper) come with fresh Pita or cucumbers (Gluten Free).    - Tryst Ahi Tuna salad - Excellent portion and very fresh.  I would just ask for extra dressing on the side. - Portobello Sandwich - It was very juicy, tasty and satisfying.  The grilled bell peppers and Portobello will fall off of your sandwich.  - Monte Cristo (two French toast slices, ham, Gruyere cheese topped with strawberry jam) - it is not greasy, and melted perfectly with the Gruyere cheese.   - Sweet potato tots are the best!  Try dipping with hummus dips if you have any left.  Skip the regular ketchup.  What a deal!  All food and drinks are half off 3-6 everyday.  After 5PM receive 2 for 1 cocktails.

I'm feeling the vibe of Vegas-style clubs transformed into a movie theater.  A full bar inside complete with stylish chic furniture all around, online movie booking with e-ticket pick up, reclining seat and a table for your drink/food, menu order option, or pick up dinner to take inside. All that for the cost of $25.00 a ticket!  The $25 also includes blanket and pillow.  You can sign up become a member for special offers and discounts.  A cool movie experience for a first date, celebrate birthday, or anniversary.

It was time to change out the air and cabin filters in my Honda Civic. I refused to pay $100 just for filters at the dealership. It was so outrageous they wanted to charge that much for such simple work.    I stopped into AutoZone first, but they didn't have them at the store. It will take about 3-5 days to special order it. I figured O'reilly was nearby so gave them a try.  So glad that I did. They have them in stock and much more selections than AutoZone. Prices were about the same.   Staff was so helpful and knowledge too. He gave me some great tips on the different filters. The best part was that he even helped me put both filters at no charge. He indicated most newer Honda Civic are designed that you can DIY and YouTube for guidance. Great place to shop and learn a little more about your car!

I finally got to experience what everyone has been talking about.  Windsor is certainly one of the rather trendy spot at the moment on Central road.  I had the Pastrami Reuben sandwich, which was really salty.  I couldn't even finish it.  However, the Porkwich with kale salad was mighty tasty.  Highly recommend this.  The atmosphere was very laid back and friendly.  The cassette wall was a genius way to recycle old cassettes.

What is there a better way to gain couple more pounds after dinner at Windsor, go next door to Churn!  I was so full after dinner, but couldn't resist the unique ice cream flavors, retro candies, vintage/silly toys, and bakery goodies all displayed around Churn.  My Niece had the Peach and Honey ice cream.  She didn't like it at all.  The pure honey overpowered the peach taste, which sounded good but was too sweet.   I had the traditional butter pecan ice cream sandwich.  You get to select from the baked cookies on the counter and the ice cream flavor.  Unfortunately, the ice cream wasn't frozen so it melted too quickly on a hot summer day.   I will probably wait until it's a little cooler to try other flavors on a pretzel cone.

I was excited when I saw Good Fellas Grill catering our staff meeting lunch last Friday. We had few trays of seasoned ground beef, marinated chicken, vegetarian dishes, and salad. Food was outstanding as always, so well prepared and delicious. I usually get the gyros and the meat platters when I dined in.  Their ground beef packed with enormous flavor. They sure loaded up on the rice in each tray.  We had plenty of leftovers to take home.  No cooking for a day or two = happy face! ;)

The best thing you can do on a cold and raining day instead of staying home is to go watch a movie.   We went to watch Arthur Christmas, very cute movie.  It was the last day for their free movie offer.   The dine-in concept is similar to AMC and iPic.  You order your movie online and pick up at the counter.  They call the movie title and time through a speaker so you stand in to enter inside the theater.  A nice and large open area for to wait. They have two or three long rows of table counters with office chair seats.   I wonder who decided to cut back and use office chairs.  According to my Sister, the chair was so uncomfortable.   I though it was tacky to use office chairs.   I sat in the back with the individual seat and sliding table.  It doesn't recline, but comfy and large enough to place my jacket and purse.   There was a button on the table for you to press for service.  Server tries to take your order before the movie starts.   I ordered a hot coffee and a basket of sweet potato fries.  The potion of fries was decent for $4.50.  The taste wasn't any fancy fries, just ok.   The coffee took a little longer.   I think they ran out and had to brew a new batch.   It sure tasted fresh.  They have a lot of staffs working in one theater.  It does get confusing who you want talk to.  They wait staff that places the order and runners that deliver the food and drink.    I found the price for a movie is really inexpensive compared to other dine-in theaters.   They have specials which is even cheaper.  I will definitely return for another movie, and hopefully I will have a hot freshly- brewed coffee too.

We had to change our plans since the haboob was heading our way.  A friend's daughter was working near by so decided to give this new place a try.  I am always skeptical when a Chinese joint trying to do Japanese food.  This place is hidden behind Applebee's and next to a donut shop.   They have a good selection of bento boxes. I had the bento #3 that came with California rolls, Teriyaki chicken, and dumplings. They even have $1 off of all bento boxes. Place is charming, staff is very friendly, and prices quite reasonable.  I'll definitely try this place again.

There is a lot of competition just from 16th street to 20th street on Camelback.  Cafe Zupas is another decent place with affordable prices.     I think the concept is similar to Paradise Bakery Cafe.  You place your order at the different counter stations, either salad, sandwich, or soup. However, they don't have a coffee station, wish they would, but do have a dessert counter.  They all looked so sweet & delicious!  A plus is while waiting in line, they give you different soups to sample.  I tried the Thai Lobster Curry soup, it sounded better than actually tasted for me.  To be safe, I stick with the clam chowder soup.  It was rich and good flavor, but loaded with more potatoes than clam meat.    All their soups include fresh bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry.  You get to choose 2 combo for $7.99.  The sandwich came as whole not just half along with the soup.  Overall, an excellent spot to get a quick lunch/dinner.

It was unusual to have Starbucks closed, but a little mom and pop Filipino coffee shop opened in the mall for Black Friday.  I guess everyone stopped by to have their turkey hangover fix to start the crazy shopping madness. It looked they were not prepared for the growing line out the door.  The service was pretty slow.  I had ordered a regular drip coffee.  I was surprised they had free refills all night.  If I wasn't so stuffed by desserts, I would try their halo halo.  Looked really good!  Besides coffee, they also have boba drinks too.  So next time you are in Arrowhead Mall, skip Starbucks and give this small business a shot.

I guess the Chinese is coming around to invade sushi too.   If you are going for sheer quantity over quality this is place to go.  The variety is excellent, and as far as I am concerned, the sushi wasn't  bad.  Most of the sauces on their rolls are similar either with eel sauce, mayo, or spicy mayo.  Nothing fancy as Bao mentioned.    I enjoyed the Rainbow, Dragon, Desert, and the Baked Scallop rolls.  The Surf Clam was on the rubbery side.   My friend had grabbed the squid salad.  It didn't taste fresh.  I'm assuming it's been circling around the belt.    Service is  very friendly and attentive.  This place is hard to spot.  It is located in a strip plaza behind US Bank next to Pita Jungle.  If you want something affordable, filling, and still tasty, this is great!

I love coming to Teres!  It always smell so good and so clean.  This is where you can enjoy a mini spa experience without the heavy price tag.   The hardest decision when I come to Teres are the selection of nail colors and homemade spa treatments. I only did a pedi this time.  I didn't have a chance to pick my color so they brought the color sticks to me.  It's great to have the colors painted on nail samples so you can place it on your nail to see the actual paint.  Loved the "School of Rock" paint color!    The only issue I had was the nail tech seems rushed through my service.  I felt I was in a doc's office than a nail salon.  It didn't look as it was that busy while I was there.

Last week, I was one of the lucky few got invited to Yelp's Spa Night.  Thanks to Lindsey for inviting me!   Unfortunately, the a/c wasn't working but everyone was in their happy mood.  I had a great time chatting with other Yelpers.    Brandon, GM of Mood Swings and his team really treated us very very well!   Snacks, chair massage, hand massage, manicure, make-up lesson, and the goodie bag with Aveda products.  Oh yea, there was bubbly too!    Thank you so much for a wonderful night of relaxation!

A group of us went for Happy Hour before the big performance at ASU Gammage.  We all sat in the back patio area.  They sure have an excellent water mist system to cool off.   You might get a little wet if stayed too long in one area.  Hey, who complaining when it's 100+!  I had ordered the Southwest Smoked Turkey Brat with sweet peppers and caramelized onions.  It was spicy yet so good you can't stop eating it.   The PEACH TANDEM must try!  A well balance of beer and cocktail.  It's a great hangout spot.  Good food, beer/wine selection & great service.

Did I just step into an episode of Mad Men?    My friend was searching for dessert places and found this hidden gem. I had a hard time looking for the place. It's hard to spot if you are coming from the 44th street.  Located just in in the corner of a strip mall closer to the 40th street end.  So many cool vintage things from jewelry, clothing, telephone, and even airplane seats!  Beside the vintage items, the main attraction is the soda fountain in the back of the store. They do have few tables inside and outside.   Creative menu named after 50's & 60's TV shows and stars.  I had the Breakfast At Tiffany's shake. If you love espresso and ice cream, this is the shake for you. I can taste strong flavor of espresso and scoop of cold ice cream, so GOOD!  There was even an extra one on the side.  I do wish they offer lactose free options.     They have fun special events every month, such as pajama night and family night.  It is a great chill-out place after dinner.

Keep on expanding Dutch Bros!  A new location closer to my work and to the 51 freeway.  The Kicker is still the best coffee no matter which way you order it, hot,cold, or ice blended.  A note those who are lactose intolerance, the iced blended are pre-blended with whole milk.

I ordered a wristlet through Ebay Coach Factory Outlet.  The style arrived wasn't exactly what I wanted.  I had stopped by the outlet store to return it.  The Manager was really helpful and made it very easy for the return.  Unfortunately, they don't reimburse for the shipping charge, which was 1/2 the cost of the waistlet.  Oh well, always can use an extra wristlet.

Sunday, May 5th, green tea ice with condensed milk topped with green tea mochi & red bean.  The green tea was really refreshing and tasted like green tea. Mochi was chewy with red bean made exactly how I like it.    Monday, May 6th - original and taro with condensed milk, red bean, black sesame.  This combo wasn't my favorite.  The black sesame sounded better than it was for me.  The original with condensed milk was the classic, tasted so creamy and so good.    Friday, May 10 - It was a busy night.  There was a long line and one cash register.  They might want to consider opening another cash register to handle the weekend crowd.  I think I found my favorite combo.  It's the Thai tea with condensed milk and red bean.  Thai tea unbelievable, highly recommend!  A friend suggested to try the almond milk tea with almond pudding.  I love almond milk tea but never had it with almond pudding.  A lot of places make this tea way too sweet.  This drink was made perfectly!  I think I have an addiction now. I do not need an intervention yet, because I will be returning soon to mix more combos. =)

Our feet and back were hurting so badly after browsing around at Glendale Glitters.  We needed a place to rest and probably use a more decent restroom than the portables. We stumbled into Krispy Creations just opened last month. Another wonderful addition to downtown Glendale.   If you are absolutely obsessed with rice krispy treats, Krispy Creations adapted them from a normal cake batter.  We didn't try any of their rice krispy treats. We did try the clam chowder soup in a baked bread bowl.  I love that the bread was baked hot and crunchy.  The soup was semi-homemade, but so comforting and delicious in the winter.  They also make their own dipped chocolate strawberry!   The owner is really sweet and friendly. Go support local if you're in downtown Glendale.

I was so excited when the new location finally opened in Mesa.  I have been a loyal fan of Beaver Choice, and have highly recommended to all my friends to try it.  Tonight, I was extremely disappointed at the whole dining experience.   We had all placed our orders at the same time. The waitress indicated that the kitchen was behind and it will take about 5-10 minutes to put the ticket inside.  We agreed.  Another friend came after we just placed the order, sat over 20 minutes without any type of service (no water or even a menu).  She had to get up to ask for them.  I know you have expanded but might just need to hire more staff to help on weekends.  We all had to ask for refills many times.      After 1/2 hour of waiting, we noticed the tables around came after us got their food even few ate and left.  I felt it was a deja vu moment reminded me the very first time I visited in the Tempe location.  They had lost our ticket and we waited over an hour too. However, the owner came out to our table to apologize.    This time when the owner came around to chat, we mentioned we have not received our food and indicated that tables around already ate and left. By now, it's over an hour!   We are very patient people, others would have left by now.       The owner came back with our waitress showing us the time that the waitress placed our orders on the POS receipt.  We knew we had placed the orders way before time indicated on the receipt.  The owner kept telling us they prepare it freshly and will take time to cook.  Again, I was loyal customer so I should know how long a normal schnitzel takes.  Over 1 hour is just unacceptable!  I felt I was in the episode of Amy's Baking Company when the owner accused the customers they were wrong.  I know the owner here is not Amy and Sammy. The family working in this establishment are much better than that.   I really hope tonight was just an one-time incident.

I love relaxed vibe and the friendly staff.  The matcha green tea snow ice blended is my favorite.  I think it is better than Starbucks Green Tea Frap.    If you don't care for their drinks, they do have froyo and other food snacks.  There are not enough boba places in the west valley. We want more!

Despite the simple name, I was impressed of their version shaved ice.  It is located in the food court inside Mekong Plaza.  If you are a fan of Snoh, their shaved ice is between ice and ice cream, still hard to describe it.  The shaving style of the ice looks like noodle.  It's a lot more sweeter and creamy.  My suggestion is putting the toppings on the side.  It is extremely sweet if added in the mix.    First time, we had ordered a plate with taro topped with red beans & condensed milk plus the green tea with green tea mochi & coconut mochi.  We had mentioned to the owner that it was way too sweet.  He came back and said "kids love sweets".  Really?  Who are you trying to target, I guess? Second time, I tried their flavor of the month Thai tea.  This time I had the topping on the side.  What a difference!  I was able to finished the cup.   According to the owner, they will experiment and have a flavor of the month.    It was great to see all the vendors were opened in the food court.  One thing I did notice is they have fans in front of some of the stations.  It gets pretty warm, good luck on scoring your own fan.

A late dinner with sister and some friends on a Tuesday night. First time at this downtown location.  The advantage of coming late is free parking and no need to circle endlessly to locate a parking space. It can be such a nightmare finding parking spaces in downtown Phoenix.     I think the restaurant is smaller than the Scottsdale location. There were a few of large parties that night.  Luckily, we found a table near the door.  It wasn't the most ideal table since you can feel the heat from outside.    Service wasn't too attentive that night.  We had a hard time finding our Waitress after placing our orders. A friend actually asked if the owner worked here, lol.  The Bartender was awesome tho!          We had ordered a few POMO classic pizzas, Capricciosa, Pomo, and Regina margherita. I have been craving for more slices since they were at the Yelp's Downtown Revival. Kids had their cheese pizza. They wanted pepperoni but wasn't listed on the menu.  If you ask, they will customize it for you.  It came as the same as the Regina Margherita but just with pepperoni thrown on top.  Who needs to wait forever at Pizzeria Bianco when you can still have fresh wood-fired oven pizza at POMO.  I'm glad they opened another location in dt Phoenix.   My sister and a friend ordered the mojito.  I got a sip of the drink.  It was on the sweeter side but still refreshing and delicious.  I would order it next time. Caution if you are lightweight drinker, consider sharing the mojito.

I seriously think I am in a sugar coma tonight!  A night indulging in GIANT cookies (the peanut butter cookie was my fave), cakes, cupcakes, pastries goodies, gelato (yummy peach gelato), freshly made English muffins, champagne, coffee, and much, much more.  You can taste until your heart's content.  Oh my!  If that wasn't enough, we all left with more delicious goodies in a gift bag.  Kudos to Lindsey, Yelp, & LGO!   Look forward to try other delious goodies from the bake shop.

I was here last week volunteering for the Special Olympics.  It's not your average community pool. The Aquatic Center is huge, clean, and beautiful.  They have a nice kids swimming area, lap lanes, diving boards, and few tube water slides.  They have plenty of parking spaces.  It is located nearby the Surprise Library.  If it wasn't so far away, I would come back for a swim.

Pallet, Local Breeze, and now The Vig Fillmore.  I hope it is a done deal.  I always loved their open spacious patio.  I arrived for a birthday dinner.  They have an amazing Happy Hour so took advantage of that. The $5 flatbread pizza with goat cheese was so delicious.

I'm surprised that I can still check-in after I came home.  I love the power of Yelp!   It felt just not the same tonight since my phone was out battery.  No check in, FB, Tweet, and no photos.  Where was my spare battery when I needed it?  We all got two tokens to use for drinks.  I started out with the rum punch.   That was one of favorite drinks.  The coconut shrimp, onion bloom petals and mushrooms were fantastic.  A great selections on the happy hour menu.   The waitstaff were so attentive and on the ball with the drinks and food.  The bar area was spacious and with private booths.  I guess you can bring the kids.    No phone was the downside of evening, but everything changed when I won the loverly gift basket.  I love Yelp BINGO!    Another great yelp event organized by our favorite CM, Lindsey.  Thanks to Kevin and everyone at Outback for making my Tuesday evening a lot better!

After I missed my chance the first time and went to wrong University location in the east valley instead of the airport area, I finally experienced what everyone has been raving about.  I got there a little after 11AM, line was already formed and parking lot was full. Luckily, there was only one parking space left.  Thanks to the owner's dad guiding the traffic and handed out bottle water for people as they waited.   The line moved slowly, but once inside you get to sample the different meats while the owner, Scott takes out from the warmer and craves them. We ordered the brisket, house made sausage, pork spare ribs, turkey breast, and potato salad. All the meats were so tender, falls off the bone, and so well seasoned. No bbq sauce needed the flavor is in the meat.  I think that's the way BBQ should be done.   Seating: There aren't many tables inside. Expect to wait for one if you want inside a/c. They do have outside seating with shade.   Note: they usually sell out fast.  If you arrived after 1PM on the weekend, most of the good stuff are gone.  As other Yelpers indicated, go early!  We had a chance to chat with the owner's wife and dad.  They have been competing in the BBQ circuit for a long time.  They also won numerous top awards nationally.  I am really glad they decided to stop competing and settle in Arizona.  Go support this mom & pop place.  Great little place,definitely worth a visit!

If a Hostess tells you all tables were reserved and absolutely no tables left, this place must be beyond amazing, right?   We dined during the Friday happy hour mad rush between 5-6PM. They did find a table for us.  However, we just needed to be out by 7PM for the next reserved party.  We ended sitting in the back patio area. It was HOT HOT, and not just for the beautiful interior design. The shade and water mist didn't help much with the high humidity that day. Our Waitress was superb! She quickly ordered and got our food.   We ordered a few items off their social hour menu and dinner menu.  I guess the Asian side in me that I'm always skeptical when it comes to Asian Fusion. I was sold and impressed on the quality of their dishes. We tried a few of the street tacos - Wild Mushroom, Korean beef and Pork "Al Pastor". They were grilled, so juicy, and incredibly flavorful. The traditional guac was just ok for me.  I do like the tortilla chips that came with it. It didn't taste like the typical restaurant chips. It tasted homemade sea salt tortilla chips.   Another dish I highly recommend off of the dinner menu is the Chinese Style Chile-Crab Garlic Noodles. It's not Crustacean Garlic Noodles, but will still satisfy your garlic noodles craving with just little spicy kick in it.  I will have to return and try it with their many cocktails too.   It's a trendy and loud place. A great place for girls night out, date night, or bring out of town guest. It is complimentary parking valet. You might be able find an available parking space by the bank if you dine after 5PM. Parking spaces are limited. The parking lot is shared with other businesses in the same area. Park at your own risk!

After a day playing in the snow up north and drinking coffee most of day, I needed something different to wake me up.  The location is so convenience, easy access off of the I-17 and next to Harkins Theater.   If it wasn't so cold outside, I would want to try their snow fluff.  I ended ordering just a hot basic milk tea.  The hot milk tea was decent but was on the sweeter side for me. I believe it was the owner that indicated no boba can be added with hot drink. If you want boba, stick with the cold drink.   Thumbs up for the friendly staff, clean restroom, and clean tables.  Thumbs down for lack of snack food items on the menu.

My Sunday Funday was working my butt off at OTF and treated to an amazing lunch at Flower Child.    The training routine was supercharged full-body workout, which I much needed. Eric, our Trainer had high level of passion to get the Yelpers in shape. Got some weights, rowing time, suspension systems (TRX), and playing with bouncing ball, sort of.  Wow, it was great to see so many rowing machines in  "orange" all in one place. A perfect way to compete on land. The other equipment were pretty basic and not difficult to use.  I can't wait to sign up for classes.    After an intense workout, what do you do next?  Well, It wouldn't be Yelp if eating wasn't involved after a workout. Flower Child literally opened the doors for us.  I know I was starving by then. They were so gracious to let us order any items on the menu. I ordered the Mix 'N Match three items with sweet corn & quinoa with greek yogurt, roasted brussels sprouts & wild mushroom, and sesame soba noodles with snap pea & mint. The sweet corn & quinoa  AHMAZINGGG!  I just can't get enough so returning back for more this weekend.  If you can't decide between hummus and guac, I guess you can have it both ways.  They brought us the avocado hummus dip with warm pitas to sample.  So Fantastic! The fresh pressed juices were great way to cleanse.    Fox Restaurant Concepts continue hiring great chefs and staffs.  Chef Zack, Manger Rob, and the entire staff are all about service and food, it shows!  Thank you Lindsey, Yelp, Orange Theory, and Flower Child so much from the bottom of my heart!

Bye bye Cuttlefish, hello The Hash!  We had a group of 15 for a Sunday birthday brunch. I have called 2 weeks ahead to reserve a table.  They don't normally accept reservations but only for big groups. I arrived early to drop off the cake and was told my reservation wasn't there.  I was a little stunned, but they were really accommodating to fit our party.   I sure missed those motorcycle bike seats at the oyster bar when it was Cuttlefish. They took them out and replaced with a DIY Bloody Mary bar.  At $7, you get to customize however you like it.  I guess the V8 juice wasn't bad either for the non-drinkers.  Who doesn't like Slim Jims? The Slim Jims added the special kick in the drink plus made a great snack while waiting for our entrees.   Herb Chicken and Waffles were popular among our table. I tried something different and went with the Herb Chicken Egg Benedict. My herb chicken was amazingly good. JL had the same chicken but hers wasn't that great. They must have made a different batch. We probably ordered all their herb chickens for that day.  As for the Egg Benedict, nothing too special. The hollandaise sauce might need a little work. It was really bland.    For the coffee fans, must try the French Press. One of the better quality coffee blends a brunch place. It was so rich and smooth. I think I probably drank 1/2 of the pot. So good!    The staff provided exceptional level of service. They kept our water and coffee filled at all times. When it was time for the cake, I believe it was the owner that went around the table and handed us with a new plate. He even brought and lighted the many candles on the cake.    Another scrumptious brunch place big enough space to have a large group. They even have a live DJ by the bar area. I believe it ends at 1PM. I don't know if this location was cursed or what, but hopefully, this place can hold on and stick around a little longer.

One of the best tea bars in Vegas! After having lunch in Chinatown, we still have to get our boba drinks fix. It is about 15-20 mins away from Chinatown. Once you arrived, you can't really see the sign until you go inside the Albertsons plaza. It's next to Subway.  Yelp photos never disappoint. Must try the taro and matcha green milk tea. I hesitated at first since taro and matcha both have distinctive taste by itself. This drink was a perfect balance between the two, super yummy!    Ooo la la, mind blowing crepes! Seriously skip lunch/dinner and just dive into the dessert. I was still extremely stuffed from lunch, but couldn't resist their crepes. It was one of the biggest and loaded with strawberries, banana, Nutella, whip cream, and green tea ice cream I seen. Every bite was so heavenly. The last few bites were the hardest yet still so unbelievable delicious. So addictive, you won't want to share!   Trust you me, the Yelp reviews and videos/photos will lead you wanted to visit this place everything you're in Vegas. Get your crepe on!

Finally, a true authentic Japanese-style ramen house in the valley. I have long been waiting for someone to  open a restaurant like this. I still wonder why it took so long to do so. If you read the Yelp reviews so far, it is obvious there is a huge demand for ramen.  We had a group of 11 dined on Saturday at 6:30PM.  I'm glad I made a reservation. I figured the restaurant would be tiny as most ramen restaurants are.  They have a long table in the middle of the restaurant to accommodation large groups, a few 2-4 seat tables, and seating around the open kitchen similar to your sushi bar.  Apparently, we were the first large group they had since opened.  When we first arrived, the waiters came by quickly and gave us water and just 4 menus. They either were short on menus or the just can't count. It was difficult to get their attention after that. I knew from there on it was going to be a really long night. We ended up sharing the menus.    We ordered the apps and main entrees at the same time. Later, the waiter came back stating they were out of regular ramen and only have the spicy ones left. Ok, a few of us changed to rice bowls and a few wanted to try the spicy. I ordered the curry chicken with spicy ramen. Oh, the noodle was spicy but bearable. I wouldn't recommend for the kiddos or anyone that can't handle the heat. My dish must have been sitting on the counter for a while. Lukewarm curry don't really mix. Although the noodle was spicy, it still tasted fresh and good chewy texture. The curry tasted bland, but the spicy noodle sort of balanced in the curry. Hint hint.  Noodles and dumplings all made from scratch and in-house by a special machine. It's serious business here, a room just to showcase that special machine and probably watch them making the noodles. They even have one of my favorite street snacks, takoyaki (octopus balls)!    After 30 minutes, one side of our group already finished their dishes while the other side was still waiting the food and apps. We noticed the people after we ordered all got their food, ate, and left.  The Waiter kept telling us the kitchen was behind. After another 15 minutes gone by, we all finally got our food except for one.   I understand there always kinks with brand new restaurants. The Owner came out a couple of times to apologize for the mistakes and even offered us drinks. He indicated when the Waiter changed our order the ticket was pushed back towards the end. The kitchen and front staff were so overwhelmed with orders which just not prepared for that night. After we all paid and was hanging out in the front of the restaurant, the Waiter rushed out stating one of the credit cards was charged with another customer's bill. Huh?   After a week or so, all my friends who charged under their credit cards noticed a refund on their statements.  Apparently, the Owner must have reversed all the charges for that night. He didn't have to do that. No doubt, he is genuine in the Japanese values. This certainly will be my go-to place when I crave for ramen!

I had a big lunch and needed something different to satisfy my craving before meeting up with friends for a late dinner. I ordered their tropical cooler smoothie. It was supposed to have a puree of spinach and kale. I'm kind of obsessed with green smoothies. You don't actually taste the spinach and kale. All I tasted was just pineapple. I couldn't taste the coconut and banana. It was still a delicious power-packed smoothie. A great alternative to even skip dinner.

After so many 4+ star reviews and was highly recommended by friends, I finally got to try out Presidio. It was sort of hidden and easy to miss the turn into the strip mall. I called for their happy hour specials. The lady on phone indicated it was 4PM to 6PM. Apparently; they must have changed the time and extended another hour ending at 7PM now.   I ordered the fish, Al Pastor, and Caritas tacos.They were all so flavorful, tasty, and so affordable. The fish taco stands out among the three. Save room and try one their desserts. Their Alfajor (sandwich cookies filled with dulce de leche, a creamy caramel confection made from milk and sugar) not to be missed. It will go so well with a cup of coffee too.

I arrived early and met up with fellow Elites Andrew and Meagan. The weather couldn't have been any better. This festival was smaller than I anticipated, but still have plenty drink samples all around. Nice set up with the wood-fired pizza trucks/booths and tables in middle of Southbridge. Got to eat more pizzas to soak up the alcohol.   How quickly an average person is likely to get drunk? Curious, the Uber station got a great breathalyzer. I am not telling who made way over the midpoint.=P  Excellent craft selections in one festival. So many great local distillers & wineries too. Live band music, giveaways, photo booth/bombs, and After Party at W Hotel!  It was a blast!  Absolutely will be back next year. Hopefully, you'll find me in the VIP section. So lucky to be part of this exclusive club. Thanks so much to Hailey, Yelp, and CrushBrew Craft for the ticket!

Spin ,spin, spin, as fast as you can. Good thing I hold on to that bar tight. I so wish I could do better. What really matter was that I had a great time.    The owner and staff were marvelous. Dry towels and wet towels provided before and after the class. Facility, locker and equipment were spotless. The check in process was great too. Tell them the shoe size, find your name, and bike number on one of two tablets then you're done. That simple!  It was just not my day. My locker key didn't come out after I locked. I had a hard time adjusting the seat and clicking on/off my shoe. The owner helped me finally got the shoe clicked on and bike adjusted. I guess some of the equipment and shoes were still really new. I do not suggest signing up for a bike in the back corner unless you like HOT cycling. You will have limited a/c. The big water bottle was perfect. It didn't matter the water wasn't as cold.   The best source of proteins before and after the class: power bars, Fire Pie pizza, salads, beers, wines, and bubbly. Best workout to burn off all that and the next day too.   Thank you to Cycle Bar for hosting and Hailey for coordinating another work it YEE!
