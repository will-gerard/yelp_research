For a city the size of Phoenix, the airport is very easy to get around. Parking is very close, they have loading/unloading zones on both sides of the terminal buildings and curb side check in service. Inside the check in & security lines move quickly. Terminal 4 is the best with the most dining options. My only complaint is that the waiting areas at the gate are too small.

The Ice Den has 3 sheets of ice and offers public skating, hockey leagues & pick up hockey. The ice is decent, the lighting good and the locker rooms clean. There is a pure shop for gear, a snack bar and also a bar. So they cover all bases.

One of my favorite brew houses in the valley. The location in Tempe makes and sells the beer, while this location just sells it, which is just fine. Located in a strip mall in North Scottsdale, it's an unassuming place from the outside. However, once inside you will find a decent size bar and dining room, including seating inside, outside and upstairs. Of course, you have to start with the beer. Their Scottish ale "Kiltlifter" (get the name?) is an annual award winning beer. However, their IPA, "Hop Knot" is slowly becoming my favorite. Their food is good and filling and worth trying. Finally the staff is very friendly. Try this place to see why they continue to earn the reviews.

An iconic saloon in Old Town Scottsdale that is a must stop to take out of town guests. It's tiny inside, so you will have an opportunity to meet your neighbors as you will be elbow to elbow. There is always live music to enjoy. Steve plays on Monday & Tuesday afternoons and is always entertaining. Tim works behind the bar and is quick with your order.

The Roaring Fork is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. It has a warm, cozy feel to it. We were shown to our table and immediately greeted by our server "Roo". Roo was very friendly and attentive throughout the evening. A nice blend of stopping by enough without being a nuisance. I asked if they made a "Blood and Sand" cocktail and was pleasantly surprised to learn they could. Oh, by the way, it was great.  For an appetizer, we shared the green chili stew, which is one of my favorites. A basket of different types of bread was brought to the table. The small corn muffins are excellent. The night we were there they had a special of duck carnitas. Served in a skillet, a generous portion of duck, avocado, onions and jalapeño, and corn tortillas. Outstanding! This place never disappoints

I love this place! The pizza is incredible with a large topping selections. They have installed a water filtering system to produce water that taste like it's from NYC. The coal fired pizza oven cooks the crust to a crisp finish.

Walked in on a Thursday night with out a reservation. They were completely packed, however, two seats were open at the "Chef's Table", as an earlier reservation failed to show up. Sitting at the Chef's table (counter) allows for interaction with Razz as he describes each of the 6 servings. Razz enjoys interacting with people and has a quick laugh. Each serving, while small in size, by the end of the night, makes for a filling meal. Razz mentioned that he has a high percent of repeat business. No wonder as the food is great and Razz makes you feel most welcome.

Tried the Village Tavern after reading good things about it. When we arrived the place was packed. So obviously, this place is doing something right. We sat in the huge dining room and were quickly greeted by our server. We ordered a bottle of wine and started to look at the menu. There were so many different options including meat, seafood and different comfort food. We opted for the filets and they were nicely chared crisped on the outside and a warm pink inside. Perfect done for Medium Rare. We will be back

So if you want to know how cold the dark side of the moon is & can't get a ride? No worries, just go to Oceanside Ice Rink for the coldest spot in the valley. I get that a cold rink usually makes for better ice surface, but really, this cold?! The good news is since ASU went to D-1, they have improved the lighting and also the locker rooms. Overall, not a bad rink.

Harold's is a must stop place in Cave Creek. It is one of those places that has a diverse crowd, but everyone gets along. Once inside, you will see bikers, Cowboys (real and posers) locals and tourists. They always a kick in' bands and the place can get rock in. Also, the owner is a huge Pittsburgh Steelers fan, so this is the place to watch their games.

This place is a must stop on Friday nights  when ever we have guests visiting from out of town. Where else can you see live bull riding, lots of fire pits, live country music, numerous bars outside that eliminates the wait for a drink. Have not tried the food. Wear your boots and cowboy hat!

Because it was too cold to eat upstairs on the patio, we ended up at the counter in front of the kitchen, which turned out to be great. This place has an amazing wine and beer list, with detailed descriptions. The menu is varied with options like game dishes, Thai food, fish plus a large offering of Mexican food. The staff is pleasant and fun. Try this place!

This place comes with great expectations due to the favorable press it receives. The neighborhood is a little dicey and finding a park was a challenge (it's in back) but once inside a saw a small bar area and a cozy dining room with most tables filled during the lunch hour. We scored a table and ordered the table side guacamole dish that most of the diners went with. The menu is not your standard Mexican fare, so fewer options than you may be used to. I went with chile Colorado with was very good. I would like to come back and try it for dinner.

The Tee Pee has been a local family favorite for years. There is also a picture of President  Bush visiting here. The decor is rather simple or plain. The draw is the food. We ordered the enchiladas and chicken burro. The burro was huge and very filling. Try this place.

One of the better craft beer places I have ever been to. Their IPA "HeadHunter"is fantastic Their limited availability IPA "Hop JuJu" is outstanding. One of the best but only available in February. The menu is decent & includes the usual burgers, sandwiches, etc. Decent tunes fill the air. The crowd includes locals and hop heads.

CK's has a great vibe and energy to it. Located close to the confluence of Phoenix, Scottsdale and PV. The parking lot is tiny but they have valet service. There are a few options of where to eat here: inside, bar or outside, which is my favorite. The servers are all very quick & friendly. We went with the Mac and cheese and tacos. Both were good and will come back again. But be warned, a little pricey.

This place is awesome. A eclectic crowd made up of bikers, golfers, tourists and locals. What more could you want as this place has live music, wood fire pits that you make your own, beautiful setting and food. The atmosphere encourages meeting the people next to you so by the end of the night, everyone has new friends.

This place has gone downhill. The rumor is that Immigration raided the place and took the cooks away. Since then the menu has been reduced to a few basic offerings. Too bad, as the setting is kinda cool, but you could find better.

We really enjoy this place. It's located upstairs in the El Pedregal complex, south of The Boulders. It is not your typical Mexican restaurant, but worth a try. Be prepared to pay for chips as they are not included. We selected the fajitas and the carne asada. Both were outstanding. Overall a fun place

One of my favorite gastropubs, anywhere. They must have close to 100 craft beers on tab. Flavors to satisfy all tastes. However, in addition to the beer, they have great food. I think their chicken tortilla soup is the best in the valley. Their menu offers real food selections not just wings and burgers. Seafood, steaks, pizzas, even Nashville Hot Chicken! They have strategically placed large flat screens to watch your favorite team. Casual atmosphere, friendly service. Try it.

Finally located this place, as it is tucked out of the way. Kinda of an interesting look to it inside. as it try's for an Irish pub feel. Good selection of craft beers posted on a chalk board.I tried a burger and it was soggy and uninspired. Go for the drinks but don't eat.

Valley Ho is a gem located on the western edge of Old Town Scottsdale. The hotel was built in the 50's and has a cool vibe to it. Once inside, you will notice that they left the interior as it was when it opened, down to the couches, chairs, lights and even the fireplace. Find a table, get a chair and order one of their many fine cocktails. Then "transport " back in time and enjoy.  While there we only had time for a cocktail before we had to go. The Bourbon Smash drink I had was excellent. We plan to come back for dinner.

Cafe Bink is the "little brother" to the more famous Blinkley's just up the road. Located in a strip mall with an outside patio to take advantage in nice weather. Inside you will find a small bar to grab a seat or you can wait for a table. As always, the food is the thing. The menu offers smaller, more simple selections. We went with the Mac & Cheese and the Sloppy Joe. Both were good and satisfying.

Located in the Phoenician resort in the former Mary Elaine's space. Obviously, the views are still incredible both from inside as well as from the balcony that also has fire pits to prolong the night. While not as over the top as Mary Elaine's, it is not just a steak house like Mastro's, Ruth Chris or Mortons. We ordered wine from the impressive wine list and started out with the calamari as an appetizer. It was lightly fried and finished with lemon and some spices. Our group all opted for the filets, along with one selection of the Dover Sole. The service was good and attentive but without being too meddlesome. Not a cheap date but a good spot for a special occasion.

In spite of the numerous quality food options in the greater Phoenix area, unfortunately, Bar-B-Que is not one of them. However, Bryan's starts to change the game by offering quality bar-b-que. They do not offer table service, so you line up to place your order. I went with the brisket sandwich. The neat was tender and the sauce was a little sweet but not too much. Try the best bar-b-que west of Texas.

Great place to have beer, bar food and watch a game.! There are plenty of screens to watch your favorite hockey game or another sport (if you can convince them to change the channel. There is a good selection of beers including Selections from Canada and also local craft beers. The food is ok, but what do you expect from a sports bar? The staff is friendly.

We heard about the fantastic Happy Hour prices extended all day on Monday, so decided to check it out. The restaurant is housed in an old home in downtown Phoenix. We sat at a table on the patio. The menu is made up of sandwichs and appetizers, a small selection of wine and beers, including some craft options. The staff was friendly and made us feel welcome.

This is one of my favorite locations in PV. Located north of Camelback Mountain the bar and outdoor seating area has incredible views of the mountain. I like to sit at the bar or a high top table in the bar area as there is a nice vibe. The Happy Hour is a great way to be introduced to this place, if you have not tried it!

Similar to many new arenas & stadiums built to replace the originals, they trade character for convenience. While there are more restrooms and wider hallways now, I'll take the original. At least keep the "Igloo" name like they did in Boston with the "Garden" name. I thought the food and drink options rather plain and basic. Also, at one place we visited, they allow you to take a beer to your seat but not a mixed drink. Can someone explain that?

Ended up here after trying to go to Citizen R+D.  We ended up sitting in the bar area on a high top. They offer a good selection of wine by the glass and had the Crush Cab, which was very good. Not sure if the bar menu is different than the main room menu, but the selections seemed rather limited.  We ended up going with the Lamb Burger and Original Chop salad. Both were very good. The wait staff was attentive and friendly,

The competition for good pizza in the greater Phoenix area is pretty intense so one has to be on their game. We found Lamp to be lacking compared to the other numerous options available. Upon entering, we noticed the bar area is very small. So not a place for many to have a drink and pizza. When we ordered our pizza, our server informed us that it would be a bit longer than normal because they were busy and their pizza oven can only accommodate three pizzas! As a result, we waited about 45 mins for our order. The pizza was ok, but not worth that kinda wait.

Grassroots has a number of locations in the valley and enjoy them all. The Scottsdale location seems to a little more crowded than the Phoenix one. The wine list is decent and the prices are not the usual 100% mark up you often see the the valley. Many good selections on the menu. We went with the salmon and the short ribs. There were no complaints from us. We will be back.

I like this place. It's close to the Ice Den and after a game of hockey I like to come here for a barbecue sandwich. While it looks like only a gas station, inside you will find a counter to order a sandwich and tables to sit at, both inside and out. The brisket is tender and they have a number of different barbecue sauces to meet all tastes.

Whenever I am in Vegas, I try to stop by. Located downstairs at the MGM, this place serves good pizza fast. Set up like a Subways, you can order some suggested pies or pick your own toppings. The pizzas come out fast and hot. The crust is thin, not doughy and the sauce is tasty.

Located next to a multi screen movie theater in a shopping center at Scottsdale Road and the 101. So parking close may be a challenge. Once inside you will be greeted by an insane number of TVs! No matter where you sit you should be able to watch at least 10 different screens at once. So not a bad place to watch your favorite game. I was glad to see that they support the local craft brews as they carry a few. I selected the Four Peaks IPA "Hop Knot". The food menu consist of the usual burgers and tacos as most sports bars do. However, I noticed they also have steaks and even salmon and ahi tuna in the menu. Since I already ate I will have to return to try the food.

Went a few days ago, shortly after their opening. Did not see their sign, but we found the place by the crowd in front.  Every seat at the bar and all tables were taking. We found some spa e at the bar and ordered some drinks. No surprise, given their name, as they have a number of different margaritas. I went with the "Rustic" which was supposed to be a little spicy, but did not register on my heat index. Ordered the grilled fish tacos, which were great! The place had a good vibe to it, with hip music adding to the experience. Finally, our server, Michelle was friendly and efficient, so the staff had obviously been well trained.

While in town for a Penns game, the manager at our hotel suggested this place for good cocktails. They were right! When we arrived the place was packed. The bar is rather small with stools being a premium. The back bar is shelves with fine whiskey's and bourbon. In fact, they have wooden ladders on rails, like the ones you would see in an old library, to reach the upper shelves. I ask the bartender, Allyson for a "smokey" and she suggested their "Blood & Sand". It was outstanding. I want to come back for a meal.

So what to expect from a restaurant with a name of Rose. Rabbit. Lie? Certainly, an experience unlike any other restaurant! The hostess stand is walled off from the dining room, until you are granted access, it is still difficult to get a feel for this place. Once inside, the dining is small and is separated by a shade like screen. We were directed to face the screen. After a cocktail to start, the screen was raised a cool jazz band played increasing the cool vibe. We spoke to our waiter and told him how much we wanted to spend per plate. This was followed by many courses of unique presentations and food combos. Everyone was pleased with the experience.

First time at this place. We found it via Yelp and the vast majority of the reviews were 4-5 stars. The reviews were spot on. We were greeted and seated by the head chef, followed shortly by our server.  After selecting a good Calif Cab at s good price, the menu reflected unique offerings including bar- b-que, seafood and steak.we ordered the bar-b-que and ahi tuna. Both where outstanding! Our servers were attentive and pleasant!  We will be back very soon!

When I asked where this place was located, I was pleased to learn it was located right across from the Courtyard hotel on Penn Ave. Il Tetto is on the third floor, part of a three restaurant complex.  There is a small elevator located on the first floor that you use to reach the roof top. Upstairs, you will find a open airy bar. At the time I went (December) the glass roof was closed, but still allowed natural light in. The bar is long with plenty of seats. Also, they have a number of large tables that seat 8 or more. The have a diverse, varied craft beer menu. I went with the Alpine Double Hoppines, which was outstanding.  Give this place a chance.

The Vig's newest location is located in the McCormick ranch part of town, thus the name. I went after the lunch crowd and at the start of Happy Hour, so it was kinda quiet. The crowd there is a little older, perhaps more laid back than the hipsters at the other Vig locations.  Nevertheless, the have a good craft beer selection and a decent Happy Hour menu to satisfy. I went with the fish tacos with were outstanding. Good place to chill.

Not sure if this place is "jinxed" but the last two restaurants to occupy this location on went out of business. Having tried their other location at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale, we thought we knew what to expect. However, I must say we were disappointed. While the ambience was nice and the wait staff was friendly, the food was a miss. It was similar to eating at a Mexican restaurant in the Midwest. The food was bland and just lacked any sizzle. Best to stick to the other location.

Decided to check this place because of the favorable early buzz. We were seated at one of the two chef's booths which face the kitchen. Watching the food being prepared was both fun and interesting. We ordered a bottle a wine and looked around at the restaurant. It is nicely decorated with a hip metro look. Jackie was our server, who was very pleasant and fun. I ordered the chicken & risotto, which was outstanding! Don, the owner stopped by. It is obvious that he only hires the staff that share his outgoing personality, as he made us feel most welcome. Don't miss this one!

The PHX airport has many decent dining opportunities, especially Terminal 4. Today, I tried America's Taco Shop. Since I wasn't that hungry I only ordered one chicken taco. There were only two other guys waiting for their orders but it still seemed like a long wait for 1 taco. The taco was just ok. It was bland and I did not enjoy the texture of the tortilla.

After reading so much buzz about this place, I was anxious to try to place. I went after the lunch crowd but before the happy hour and dinner crowd.  So while it was kinda quiet, I have to say that I like this place! They have a reasonable size dining room, a good size bar and a dog friendly patio! They have 64 beers on tap with 35 being from AZ. Thanks for supporting local brews. I ordered the Margarita pizza and was pleased to learn that their "Pizza Chief" used to make the pizzas at Pizzeria Bianco! It was fantastic and no waiting! Great place. Will be back.

Billed as the nation's friendliest airport. Very easy to park or to pick someone up. Great flight options and the dining options in Term 4 are outstanding. Currently, they are renovating Term. 3, so the hope is that the finished product is similar to #4.  The tram service is a quick way to transfer between terminals
