One of the worst major airports. Tsa is set up in hallways. You can't get from terminal to terminal. So when on delta your choice is Mexican or Wendy's. Horrible. Bathrooms way too small always a line, and dirty!!! Not enough seating in terminal area.   The mexican resturant had a line out the door, 25 deep.   Really bad airport. Good luck returning your car, you have to drive thru the entire airport and outthe other side for 3 miles... Then you get an 8 minute bus ride back...

So we got there with a group of 35... Yea.  They were very good to us and set us up in the patio area.  The wind was kicking up, so it got a bit cold, but not terrible.   The servers were great, quick and took care of drinks in a hurry.  They assigned 3 to our group which really helped. The food seemed pretty quick to come out.  The bloomin onions made it out ahead, which was super. Very please overall!

This was a surprise on the trip.  An indoor kind of outlet mall.  I say kind of because some are outlet worthy, others are not.   Nike had one really good deal and the rest of the items were closeout ugly stuff, or the good stuff at regular prices.  So no real bargain there.  Call me an elitist, but I live near the epicenter for Nike, in Oregon, so we know our Nike.   The great find was the gelato guy near door 3.  Wow.  This guy was super nice, and the gelato was incredible.

This is that perfect place for guests to showcase the fun in Phoenix.  The place is lively, with weekends being very packed!  The nachos are the perfect starter here.  They are pretty addicting...  so be careful, hand your wallet to your friends or you will get carried away.  even thou they are huge we finished them off. The staff was outgoing, and attentive.  We never waited for refills.  Might have been a touch too attentive, but it beats the alternative.  Easy parking and easy to get too.   Friend had the vegi burger and could not stop talking about it...

Love this hotel. To start the valet stand is awesome. They get your car quickly. Rarely a wait.  The front desk is quick and efficient and made sure to get my preferences.  Here is the great part. On my way to the room I was asked 4 times by staff members if I needed directions or needed anything. That is service!   Had a great time in the tower and even took in a show.

Seriously, you want shoppers yet you have half the sidewalks torn up?  We were there on a Wednesday at 10am.  They had 30% or so of the sidewalks blocked of and we only saw 3 workers?  get it done, why so slow... The selection of stores is good, some big names in here.  The prices are not typical outlet mall.  They are marked up for the tourists like me who thing we can get a deal in Vegas..  So wrong, deals in Vegas are long gone...  Anywhere you have to pay for the privilege of a lounge chair at the pool no longer is a cheap place to visit,  I digress..   The parking was tough even that early.  Clearly we were there at opening and the staff working the stores have taken all the 1st floor parking in the garage.  Pretty stupid guest service.   Then you hike from the garage to the shops.  If you can get lucky and find a parking spot on level 2 you can take the bridge and escalator and drop in by Nike. The only real deals we saw were at Kate Spade.  After that we could beat every price and home or at regular retail..  And the final straw... The food court bathrooms were closed.  No one working on them, but closed.  that is pretty crappy.  The next closest restrooms were the opposite direction of the parking garage.   First visit, last visit.

Can someone clean this place?  my god.  Glass, clothing, trash, and beer cans everywhere.  I can only imagine the night life here.  The pants and jean skirt indicate we have the finest of trailer park patrons having a great night out.  The next morning comes the "hey where is my skirt" conversation.  And maybe where is my dignity.   I love the rocks, trails etc.  but being next to the highway and the car noise kind of lowers the "nature" feel...

Loud, bright, crazy, expensive. It's exactly as it should be.  It's about the atmosphere, and they deliver. Our group had a great time. The bartender made great drink selections and we had some great appetizers.  Never really had dinner, kind of forgot after the apps cane out.

Lets start by saying this is in a good location.  It is near the outlet mall, and some food places.   The rooms are on the smaller side, beds are sagging, the spreads are old and getting threadbare.  The towels have been dried on too much heat and are hardened, with gray splotches from all the bleach.   What really was silly was an employee was watching sereral people in our party that were sitting on the couches in the lobby drinking Dutch Bros coffees.  He then came over to me, the one not drinking, and said that we had to be really careful that management does not want any spills on the furniture.  Really? we are grown adults.  We did notice afterwards that one of the end tables had a sign that said no food or drink... I say again REALLY?  its an hotel lobby.  This is where guests congregate.  Where the drink beverages and talk.  Why have couches there if you don't wnat people there?

can someone please clean up?  This could be such a great place!  the views are great, the trails are easy to walk, and it is very close to downtown.   So please keep this park up!  why is the city doing nothing?  what is that huge sales tax for anyway?  there was broken glass everywhere.  cups, bottles, and lots of clothing.  Seriously need to set up a night camera to see what goes on here after dark, could be a good documentary.   Start by adding some trashcans along the trails.  only saw 2 during our two mile travel.  How about assigning someone on a quad to patrol and pick up litter.  How about a sweep at night to remove overnight guests? The one thing you can't fix is the noise from cars, makes for an odd walk in nature when you hear so many autos.

It's like the softball field of dreams. It has a special feel that is hard to describe. The tv camera stands, the great speaker system, the outfield wall. It looks just like it does on tv. It was a treat for my daughter to play here.
