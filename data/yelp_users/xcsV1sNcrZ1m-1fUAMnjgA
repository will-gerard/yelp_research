I utilized Deer Creek for its Doggy Day Care, and they were always amazing.  The price (at the time $15ish), is way more affordable than any other day care facility.    My dog had A LOT of energy and I was so happy to find a place she would be able to play all day and I could feel comfortable leaving her.  I love the fact that if its too hot outside, the dogs can come in and roam around behind the counter and are not kenneled.  All of the staff was amazing and always happy to see Maxxi.    Unfortunately my dog was hit by a car and killed so I did not have the opportunity to take her in there for her yearly shots, but when I do decide to get another pet, I will for sure be taking them there for both day camp and vet services.    All around great place.

I ordered them last night for the first time and it was pretty bad.  I actually thought they were the Chinese place on Tatum and Bell, turns out I was wrong.    I ordered Chicken Fried Rice and it was seriously an embarrassment to the Chinese culture.  Probably all Americanized Chinese food is an embarrassment, but you get my point.    My rule of thumb is that if you are going to eat at an "ethnic" food place, the people working/cooking there should be of whatever decent the food that is being served is, that wasn't the case here.    Major thumbs down.

Horrible customer service. I have been receiving calls for over a week that a prescription was ready (I have been out of town - and the prescription was supposed to be ready before I left but they did not fill it in time) and I go today to pick it up.  I tried once this morning and they don't open until 8 (unknown to me but that's not why the customer service is bad).  I try again this afternoon and after no less than 5 voicemails telling me my prescription is ready and a call last night - it's not ready.  They offer to fill it while I wait but I have to go inside and wait for a few minutes and they would fill it. I asked if I could just drive around the drive through again in 5 mins but the tech says I have to come inside and wait. Why? What is the difference between waiting inside for 5 minutes or staying in my car, where I have groceries that can't be sitting in a hot car?  It makes zero since why I couldn't have waited a few minutes and driven through again.  They aren't going to magically make my pills appear once I walk inside.  She said if I wanted to come back in a few hours then I could drive through again.  What?!  I might be a customer with mobility issues, why would you make them come inside.  She just stared at me and could not offer a valid reason for this absurdity.  I drive away and am having my prescription transferred to another pharmacy.  I don't care if this is the closest pharmacy to my house. I will never go in there again.

This place is one of my favorites to bring anyone who would like to have great Mexican food that knows what good Mexican food tastes like.  I've been going here for several years and it is always delicious.    They have become my exclusive provider of chicken quesadillas (shredded chicken that is).  Theirs is the best and I will not order one anywhere else in the WORLD as they just don't compare.   The waiters are great.  They get their job done, they are friendly and quick.  They won't stand around and chat with you - which is not a negative.    Excellent margarita's - they are not from a mix and they are amazing.    Love, love, love this place.

Used to love the Turkey Burger.  It was my go-to there but they took away the potato bun, changed the lettuce and the turkey is super dry (it used to be so juicy).  Go back to what worked, the new version sucks.

Hands down the best sandwich place Downtown.    You can always count on them to be fast, quality and delicious.  Anything you order there is good - and you can't say that about many places.

Went for lunch with some friends met up here and there was mixed reviews.  I ordered the carne asada burrito - because they claimed to be home of the best carne asada in the Valley.  Totally not true.  The burrito was pretty blah, boring, and certainly not the best carne asada.  I was super excited  to see they had street corn and ordered that as well.  Totally disappointing.  I've never had street corn that tasted and looked like it was dipped in mayo.  A little too liberal with the usage of mayo for my taste.   My friend ordered the special which came with a veggie quesadilla.  It had guacamole in it - that's it.  Nothing else.  It didn't even make sense.   The salsa was boring.  That's really all there is to say about it.    All around, it was very average and uninteresting.  Too many other good places in DPHX to go to get quality Mexican food.   The one saving grace and the only reason I'll even consider going back was the beans that came with my friends special.  I tasted them and they were delicious.  I will for sure come back and try a bean and cheese burrito.

Every 5 months or so I end up here, not because I really want to but because I don't have time to go somewhere else better.  Each time I eat here it reminds me of why I avoid it in the first place.    I've tried several things on the menu and basically everything is horrible.  By far the worst thing is their rice.  Its a real problem for a Mexican place when I (who is not Mexican) makes better Mexican rice than they do.  It is oily, without any flavor and today it was undercooked - meaning it was still hard.  Disgusting.    Its a real shame that a place like Carolina's isn't in this location - you know a place that actually makes enjoyable food.    Do yourself a favor and make the drive to Carolina's or El Commadore, but if you don't have time for that, grab a microwave burrito at the Circle K and it will be better than this place.

This place is a joke.   They are completely inept to handle any group larger than 4 people.   Unable to accommodate our  large group, they offered the option of family style.  Sounds like a good idea right?  Wrong. They brought out what I assume to be their regular sized portions for everyone to share.  Family style implies that it feeds more than one person.  They don't need to be Bucca (Disgusting BTW) sized, but geesh.    On top of all that they don't even serve fountain drinks.  The only serve "natural" products.  Get over yourself.   I'd rather go buy a frozen Stoffer's and bake it and serve 2 liters than ever go to this disaster of a place again.

Didn't get the woman's name who did my nails, but I will say she was fast and did a good job.  The problem was another worker who rolled her eyes at me when I said I wasn't finished looking at the gel manicure options.  Apologies that I'm not able to look through over 200 different colors while the technician had one hand in a bowl and filing the other hand.  Super rude, weird vibe in the whole salon.  Won't be going back here despite how fast they were.  Would rather go to a place that was slower and in a less "desirable" shopping center than spend my dollars in a place where there is just outright rudeness.

This was my second attempt to go to Duce.  The first time we didn't check before we went and turns out they are closed on Monday's - not their fault.  We finally made it for lunch and it was great.  The atmosphere is really cool, the retail space is way over priced but its on par with Anthropologie and people seem to like to shop there.  I like the concept of the entire space and its very different than the 8,000 Subway's that are Downtown and accessible at lunchtime.    The patio area was great, I went just two weeks ago and there were plenty of umbrella's and it wasn't too hot - only about 105, so it was nice to be outside.  I ordered the Meatball sliders, my friend ordered the Tuna and we shared a giant lemonade.    It was really expensive - but anytime you are at a place that serves local & organic food and its non-corporate owned, its not going to be cheap, what was surprising were the portions.  The portions were actually quite sizeable and more than adequate, so in that respect the pricing was appropriate.    Meatballs were really delicious, the bread was great, everything was very fresh.  My friend really like her tuna sliders.  The lemonade was actually really good, even a bit sour rather than sugary sweet, which is my preference.    I would for sure go back for lunch and will likely hold an event here as the rest of the space is so huge.   On a side note, my car battery died in the parking lot.  The owner came out - during the lunch hour and jumped me to get my car going again.  Pretty good customer service if you ask me.

When this place used to be the Silver Spoon Cafe - it was decent and most importantly edible.   Not anymore.   We went there for breakfast this morning and my friend and I each ordered a breakfast sandwich (Egg, Sausage, Cheese & English Muffin and Egg, Bacon, Cheese and Biscuit - we both had hash browns.  I opened the box to douse the hash in ketchup and everything looked good, so I thought we were off to a good start.       Back at the work, we each went into our respective offices and ate - then simultaneously emailed each other how horrible it was.    An excerpt:   Friend: "I took it apart and ate the egg and hash browns everything else went in the trash....and you know I love bacon but even that was awful."  Me: "That was the worst thing I've ever tried to eat.  Trashed it. "  The hash browns were mediocre.  One bite of the sandwich and I spit it back into the container.  The sausage patty was some weird spicy thing (it tasted like what I imagine rancid food tastes like).  The egg - which they fool you into thinking because they cook on a griddle that it will be a fresh egg, but no, it was the same microwaved-looking B.S. that you can get at Subway - and it was CRISPY!  How do you make a crispy egg????  Vomit.  I won't even waste my time going back there for their little ice cream counter.

Sorry to say but the sand which I just attempted to eat was disgusting.  I drive less than 5 minutes home with it and the whole bottom part of the sandwich was soggy.  I pulled the bottom part of the bread off and just ate the tops.  Zero flavor and I actually had to spit it out of my mouth.    Aside from the gross sandwich, when I arrived it was not busy, but it took way too long to get such a low quality sandwich made.  Maybe soaking the bread in water is what took so long.  The girl at the register had her hair in her face and was scratching her head.  Then went on to make sandwiches.  I am hoping she washed her hands.    Super disappointing because I've had other good Firehouse experiences but I'll never go back to this location.  Vile.

I get SNS nails done here by Katie and she does an amazing job.  Amazing salon, always clean and fast.  I like the SNS because it's gentler on your nails than gel - and no UV lights.  Make an appointment!
