Found a great rate on Golf Now - called in and spoke with Brad. He was extremely friendly, courteous, and gave great advice on what course to play. Hole 15 on the Links Course has incredible views and I recommend this course to anyone looking for a great value. One of the oldest courses in Phoenix too!

Good Venue! Set up well and great acoustics! Sat in the balcony for a concert and had an awesome view. There are a few restaurants right down the street that is just a quick walk from the Theater. Drinks were a bit pricey, but that is too be expected at any concert hall. Will definitely find an excuse to come to another show and try the floor seats.

10+ times and counting. I love this place. Not being from Arizona, I really miss grass. Orange Table is tucked away without it's own parking, but if you PARK in the right place (by the Saguaro and close to Indian School Road) you will see the best kept grass, trees and gardens in Old Town. The walk through the park alone is worth the trip.   Once you get there, depending on the time of day, you may have to wait. Order any of their original coffees, which are all excellent, put your name in and walk around the gardens or browse the art gallery across the way.   In my opinion, Orange Table hires based on personality, not necessarily skill or raw talent as a server. Your waiter or waitress will be personable, warm and 100% customer service focused. Give them a break if they make a few minor mistakes. Ask for dish recommendations.   As for the food, I've sampled a few different plates, but I cannot go there anymore without ordering the Green Flannel. For me, it is one of those breakfasts I think about during the week; it keeps me coming back on the weekends. Even when I go there intending to eat something else, I still order the Green Flannel.   The burgers, melts, omelets, pancakes, and morning cocktails are all phenomenal too. If you haven't been yet, GO.

Let me start off by saying that I am current resident with over 16 months of tenancy.  In regards to my experiences with the San Marin....  My father said, "If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all"

Came in the other day for my 30th+ time. Gentlemen behind the counter informs me that it is "Happy Hour" and my second smoothie will only be $1. Wish I had found out about this sooner.   5PM - 7PM is Happy Hour.   Buy one smoothie, get one smoothie for $1

I was pleasantly surprised to find this place! Stumbled upon them on Yelp when another taco place I was craving wasn't open. The menu is plastered all over the wall so you will immediately notice the fair price points for all their dishes. I ordered street tacos and a quesadilla.  Both were phenomenal, the rice and beans are also top quality.   As I was walking away with my to-go order, the chef yelled after me to let me know that he had put sour cream on my tacos, "Was that okay, or do you want me to re-make them"? You just don't get service like that everywhere.   Great Job Taco Jalisco, You are looking like my new GO-TO taco spot.    ***Easter Egg***  The Carne Asada street tacos come loaded with meat and not one, but 2 tortillas stacked together. It's like getting 2 for the price of 1

New Location.   Huge inside with plenty of room for early morning business meetings. To date, the drive thru has always been too crowded so I usually just go inside. Even with a long line they move quickly. Nice patio outside too!

Things we all look for in a "do-it-yourself-carwash"  Feeling of Safety? - Check New equipment? - Check Accepts Credit/Debit Card - Check The foam in the brush comes out generously? - Check   All in all, a solid car wash.

I recommend buying seafood here. Best tuna I've seen in a while.

Been here 2x. Both experiences were excellent. Sitting outside provides the added bonus of a nice cedar smell. Inside, gigantic brewing containers hold the homemade sodas. I tried the Prickly Pear Soda. It was tasty, but not my thing. The The Cider Mill Dip is excellent and comes with big portions. I recommend the cottage cheese for a side. I give it 4 stars for quality but I'm holding back the 5th because I feel menu prices are a tad bit above market.

I used this company for rides to and from The Phoenix Open. I had a few friends in town and needed a bit more room then unusual. I must say it was one of the nicer busses I have ever been on. The layout was great, seats were comfortable and the insides were finished with Tile and Granite.   The owner of the company was easy to work with and the Driver was friendly and accommodating. For such a busy day, they were extremely patient with our group.  They even allowed us to keep our refreshments under the bus while they ran another group to and from the Open (which kept the total price down as well).  Will definitely use them again!

I have ordered flowers 2X from Rachel and both times I have been 100% pleased with the results. Rachel listened to exactly what I wanted and didn't try to upsell me on a more expensive bouquet. She makes the ordering process easy over the phone, and I always feel confidant she will deliver a beautiful arrangement.   Both times I needed them for delivery and they were always delivered on time or ahead of schedule.  Highly Recommended!!!

Excellent!   Discovered this place right after they opened and was thrilled with all the BBQ options. I've been about 15 times now and haven't had any issues with service or food quality. I brought some BBQ back to work and now my whole office goes at least once a week too. I usually get the BBQ Tacos or BBQ Brisket. Their Corn is great as well! If you feel like eating there, they have a great patio and you can get your car gassed and washed while you eat.   Any Midwest BBQ fans out there, try Toms Thumb!

Antonio is a master artist! Good guy and cares about his customers. I brought him a picture of what I wanted, he listened and then pulled out his own pictures of cuts he has given to current customers. He is quick, efficient and no BS. I'm out of there in 20 minutes everytime with exactly what I want.

Don't bother. If you see my other reviews I only try to leave positive feedback and deal with companies directly when I have a bad experience...   Like many people, I was drawn to the low monthly fees and relatively new facility. When I signed up it was just: Sign here, initial here, date here ect.   I WISH I HAD READ THE FINE PRINT.   They don't tell you about an annual maintenance fee or they will raise the rates on you. (My mistake for not reading fine print). But what really ticked me off is the charge you to cancel. I moved to another state and when I tried to cancel on the phone, they told I needed to have a certified letter sent or they wouldn't let me cancel. Who has time to go to the post office to cancel a $15/month membership?? Just ridiculous.   You know that saying, "you get what you pay for?" - Well I recommend spending a bit more money and finding a gym that will work with you and not try to steal every last dollar from their customers.  I hope this review deters anyone considering this shady business.

Wonderful! I stopped in before it officially opened and all the managers were excited, friendly and gave me coupons and free samples. The equipment is brand new and the place is meticulously clean inside. They gave me a custom bag with my name on it for future drop offs. There is something about getting my clothes cleaned with brand new machinery that makes me feel good. I have nothing but positive things to say about the employees, managers and guest service. Not sure what Kathy M is talking about! I have been multiple times and they are consistently excellent! Perhaps she owns another dry cleaning business!   Easy to drop off clothes on your way to Starbucks in the morning.There is a 24 hour drop off too if you come after business hours. Give them a try!
