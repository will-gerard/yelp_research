This place is amazing. I brought my dog in right when they opened without an appointment and they were able to fit me in and get me out of there in time for me to get to work by 9. Riley did so good with her, and he hates the vet. We will definitely be going back.

I've been going to Kristie for years! I literally don't trust anyone else with my hair. Whether I go in with an exact idea of what it is that I want or just tell her to do what ever she thinks will look good, the color always turns out amazing.   The salon itself is pretty great too. They have a cute little cafe and boutique which is fun to shop while waiting on the color. I've sent quite a few of my girlfriends to Kristie and they all have loved her.   I only get color done, I'm too scared to get my haircut again after a bad experience at a different salon. But, if it really needs it, Kristie will snip my ends for me which is jsut perfect.

Perfection. Brenna made me look absolutely fabulous for my friend's wedding. The color was spot on, even my boyfriend was impressed. I will not be going anywhere else ever again.

Food is delicious. Atmosphere is lovely. But the service is pretty rough. Came to lunch with coworkers, and we were here over an hour and there were people who still hadn't gotten their food. They eventually refunded money and gave them their food to go but it was a little ridiculous. I don't recommend coming here unless you have the time to sit around for over an hour waiting for your food.
