Let me say that Dr. Kaye is awesome but his staff is awful. I have been seeing Dr. Kaye for years and in January needed a surgery. I paid upfront for the surgery. The doctor was paid in full in early March by the insurance company and my out of pocket was $0 according to the insurance company since all of my deductible was applied to the surgery center. It is the middle of June and even though I have been calling and leaving a ton of messages I still have no refund and not even a call back from the staff. I have even had the insurance company call me and leave voicemails stating that they need to refund my money and they never called the insurance rep back either.

I go to lunch here regularly and the food is consistent and excellent. The owners are always friendly and recognize us when we come in. The red lentil soup is amazing. Falafel and hummus is really good too.

Everything was fresh. The chicken parmigiana was amazing. Bruschetta was made  with fresh mozzarella which is rare these days. The alfredo sauce was okay but not great, a tad unseasoned and a bit watery, which is why I didn't give 5 stars. Our waitress was attentive and helpful.

Food was good. Server was helpful and attentive. It's overpriced for what it is. $9 for potstickers seems  a bit much.

The service was awesome and the food was amazing. Probably the best fried rice I've had. We did teppanyaki with the kids and they loved it. Our chef was Daniel; he was engaging and really got the kids into it.

The only good thing about this place is the view. Absolutely beautiful lake views. That's where anything decent ends. I went there with friends for what we thought would be a relatively short lunch. It wasn't even that busy because it was overcast but it took the waitress over 10 minutes just to acknowledge us. We ordered our lunches and my friends ordered some drinks. It took the bartender 15 minutes just to get the drinks. We waited more than an hour for the food during which the waitress didn't even come over to provide updates that it was coming out or being worked on or  see if we needed drink refills. We needed to leave so my friend actually had to go in the kitchen area to tell the waitress that we needed the food boxed so we could go. We get the boxed food over 15 minutes later & when I did get a chance to eat it, it wasn't even that great. Maybe this place is okay for drinks at sunset but that's about it.

I stayed away from this place for a while because its small and looked more like a fast food joint but I was pleasantly surprised. The refried beans are amazing!!! The whole family was happy with it. Just be prepared that the place is really small but that adds to the small business feel.

This place has absolutely the best re-fried beans in the valley. Its quite small inside but all the food I've had there is great and so is the service. The chips and salsa are good but not great that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
