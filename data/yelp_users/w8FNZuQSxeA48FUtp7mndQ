I've been visiting All About Books and Comics for the past 20 or so years and I'm yet to find a comic store in Arizona to match it. The owners, Alan and Marcia are the most kind hearted people that will search high and low for any comic or collectible you desire. They and their knowledgeable staff have never missed filling my comic box every week and through the years they've gotten to know my tastes and enjoyments which enables them to give me great recommendations. I've grown to love the shop and staff so much that despite moving quite far away, I still travel the distance for the All About Books and Comics experience so many regulars and new shoppers have grown to love. As long as I live in Arizona I will only buy from this local gem. Thank you Alan, Marcia, Eddie, and the rest of the All About staff.

Every Saturday my father would take me here when I was a kid and I would always order the same meal, cheeseburger, side of cheese fries, and a medium coke. As an adult this order has never changed. I highly recomend this place to anyone who wants to indulge in a good burger. My one regret so far is I still have yet to try a slider from here. Also the cheese fries are amazing! Enjoy.

I visit this place at least twice a month and have done so for the past 12 years. The food is amazing and the staff are always friendly and helpful. They always seem to have good specials too. They also have different levels of spice and a good beer selection. My favorite is the #23 Garlic Chicken mild. Enjoy

This place has everything I like in a small pizza joint.  Pizza by the slice-check Small salads & Wings-check All you can drink soda-check An inviting dining area with two nerds playing Dungeons & Dragons in the corner-super check  If your in downtown Glendale & want a quick slice of pizza then you owe it to yourself to check it out.

I'm somewhat of a newbie when it comes to Hawaiian BBQ. I've seen an increase of these kind of places sprout up over that past couple years but never really tried one until late last year. I found out that day, that I love Hawaiian BBQ.   The first time I came here was last week. I was running some errands & wanted a quick bite. I tried the Hawaiian chicken & rice bowl. The meat was fresh & juicy not to mention plentiful. They have free sides of Teriyaki sauce so I mixed in a little with the rice which made the meal all the better.  The second time I ate here was last night. I decided on the Hawaiian BBQ mix which consists of chicken, beef, & short ribs. It comes with sides of rice & macoroni salad on a bed of cabbage(or more rice if you're like me & don't like cabbage). I paid $7.99 + $2.00 for a drink. Well worth it! Once again all the meat was fresh, hot, & tasted great. The rice was wonderful & the macaroni salad was perfect(a little heavy on the mayonnaise but that's the way I like it). I wasn't able to eat it all in one sitting because there was so much food & brought the rest home. I loved it. The customer service was great & the dining room was clean. I will be back for sure.

Due to an allergic reaction to a med, I got the fortunate chance to book a room at this fine establishment. We will first start with the ER waiting room. I've made it to the ER on three different occasions & it's been clean, inviting, big, & most important fast. Next up, the actual ER. Small individual rooms with semi comfortable transfer beds. All but one ER nurse I've had were professional & caring. Nurse Ratchet accused me of drug seeking. I told the ER doctor she was a dick & he told her to go away.   On my third visit I got upgraded to a 5 day resident due to that allergy I mentioned at the beginning. This is where this place shines. All rooms are single rooms with comfy beds. They have TV's(not the best selection of stations) & some rooms have a radio. Most rooms have Internet for Laptops. The food is really good for a hospital(as long as your not on a special diet) & they have everything from breakfast burritos to a steak. The nurses & doctors were all great & treated me like a guest more than a patient.  I hated being sick but I would of hated it more if this place wasn't so comfortable.

There are so many reasons why I have issues with Borders but I will just name a few.   1. When it comes to movies & music they are way overpriced. Why would I spend $10 to $15 more on something I can pick up at any other store?!   2. Special orders can take a couple months to get there. I ordered some books from this location on two different occasions. One month passed, nothing. Two months passed, nothing. On the third month I checked with them, still nothing. They told me one of them had to be reordered & the other was extremely difficult to get. But they will call me when it's in. I went to Barnes & Noble up the street. Ordered them & had them in my hands by the weekend. That was 4 months ago. Guess who still hasn't called?  3. Finally, and this is a big one to me, they destroy there own books & still expect people to buy them. What I'm refering to is the security tags. I've found books with the tags stuck right on the pages covering words or on graphic novels, stuck to the drawings. When asked about this, the employees respond in a rude tone about it being easy to remove(the hell it is) & it's the only way to prevent shoplifting(no it's not)! I worked in loss prevention for many years & that's just lazy talk. Both me & my father have purchased books that have been ruined by a tag that could of been put on the back of the inside cover.  This happens at all Borders books, & music, but since this was the one I had shopped at, it got my review. I will shop elsewhere.

I enjoy this place so much it gives me happy feet! I was looking for a burger place that wasn't fast food near my house one day & stumbled upon this tasty establishment. I walked in to see a very clean & very inviting dining room. They have a wide range of foods from hamburgers, wings, fried zuchini, cheese fries, & so much more. They just recently added steakburgers which I can't wait to try. The bacon cheeseburger is so good it makes my stomach smile. Maybe I'm crushing so hard on this place because I just ate there tonight but do yourself a favor & eat here if your around 91st ave & Thomas. Enjoy!
