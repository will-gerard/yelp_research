Love the East End Food Co op .  Reasonably priced organic selections.  The smoothie/juice bar is outstanding.  Great vegan/and or healthy selections at the hot and cold salad bar.  My most favorite thing here is the ability to purchase raw, unpasteurized unhomogenized milk.     The staff is very friendly, the. produce is very fresh.  This is definitely a good way to avoid the over priced, over processed major grocery chain food selection.  I love the co op.

I love Ritter's.  The fried green tomatoes are my favorite.  And judging from the very long lines on the weekend, I am not alone in my love of this place.   Yes, it is a million years old inside and out, and so are the waitresses.  There are 3 or 4 waitresses and they share as many teeth.  But this place is old Pittsburgh and you gotta love it.  The food is good, not amazing...unless you're drunk.  Then it is f---ing fantastic.    As per Pittsburgh standards, even bad food is pretty good if served in large quantities.  You won't leave Ritter's hungry.  You may leave with an infection or rash, but you won't leave hungry.

This place was absolutely loaded with flies.  That almost made me leave.  But we totally loved the food. The chicken tikka masala and the tandoor chicken were off the hook. The garlic naan was fantastic.  As a result, this is our new favorite place for take out.  No flies that way...they were the most aggressive flies I've ever seen.  They had no problem getting right up on us and after the food

My husband went in for the first time today.  We travel a lot and he has visited barber shops far and wide.  This is one to which he will definitely return -- His hair does look and smell amazing.  Mario cut his hair and my husband said that he doesn't even realize how good he is.   Totally a guy's place -- the decor is that of an old garage, with tool chests for barber stations and garage style sinks.  Very cool.  Clean and nice and they got him in quickly.  Be sure to hit this place up during the week as weekends you can expect to wait at least an hour as scruffy men are lined out the door waiting for a good cleanup.

Honestly I am shocked to read some of the more tepid reviews on here -- no offense, but I wonder if they ate at the same place we did?  This place was excellent.   My husband and I both think we are individual experts at BBQ.  He travels all over the country and tries the ribs everyplace he visits -- whoopee.  Meanwhile, I grew up in Memphis, attending the Memphis in May cook off every year and visiting award winning BBQ joints the other eleven months.  Whichever one of us is right about their superior knowledge of BBQ (clearly I am) we both LOVED the food here.  This is without doubt, as close as I've come since I left Tennessee.  The pulled pork is smoky and so tender it melts. The Cole slaw was on point -- and pulled pork ain't Memphis style without coleslaw right on the sandwich.  The sauce is sweet and tangy and fantastic.    The ribs were smokey and tender.  They were so good without sauce that it was a personal struggle deciding to dip or not dip each bite of rib meat.  Don't go in expecting a fancy dining room and table clothes with this five star experience.  However, if you're looking for really authentic BBQ, this place is the bomb.

Well, two weeks out from making what I felt was a fair deal, I am here to leave my review.  Everyone was super nice while making the deal.  The problem has been, of course, AFTER the deal.    I was told that the car had been fully serviced when it was traded in (I bought a two year old car). When we checked the oil, it had clearly NOT been serviced.  That lie should have been my first red flag. But I loved the car so I proceeded.   There are outstanding financial and mechanical issues that I was promised would be handled before we made the deal and it has been an absolute exercise in frustration.  This has left a very bad taste in my mouth.  I went from the excitement of purchasing a car I really wanted to now wishing I had never walked into that dealership.    The dealership owes me $8300 and every time I call no one knows who I am or what I am talking about. (7 calls now over the past week). Each time I am promised a return call.  Not one person yet has followed through.  They have lost the deal paperwork, they failed to follow through, I don't have a title to the car I purchased and was paid in full...the list goes on and on.  No one there seems to care about us as customers, they have my money, they have their deal and we are left hanging and feeling lied to and ripped off.    We won't go back.

The room was decent at best.  The staff was relatively nice but inept.  The conference planning was abhorrent.    The food in the bar was adequate but overpriced.  The drinks were meh as well.  Asked for a slice of Avocado and apparently the kitchen is a few floors away (that's what I was told) because it took a full 20 minutes for the avocado.  Mediocre food, mediocre service, high prices.  Hmmm.  Avoid.   The rooms are dark and dingy with low ceilings. The bathtub looked like someone washed engine parts in it. The sink sprayed directly at the front of my pants. Just really bad for the price, location and expectations.  If I was paying $60 a night I would be ok with this place.    We had a conference here and it was so poorly put together by this hotel that I wouldn't suggest or recommend this place to anyone under any circumstance.

I came to the buffet for salad. They had spinach and good dressings.  I was pleased with my salad. Anything else on the buffet looked like it was 20 years old. Dry gross and gross.  However, the crowd didn't seem to be starving -- at all.  So no one missed a calorie and I guess all is well that ends well.

Rapid service.  Clothes were perfect.  Whoever that dude is in the other review who bad mouthed this place because the owner doesn't speak great English needs to try living in another country and starting a business before he judges - this is America and half of our natives don't speak proper English while this newcomer is doing her best.  In fact, said reviewer had more than a few issues writing in what I presume is her native tongue.  The place did great work and I don't care if we can have long intense conversation - she understood everything we asked for and delivered.    We travel all over the country and use dry cleaners and laundromat services everywhere - this place was as good as any we've used.

HORRIBLE TREATMENT.    After having been a very frequent customer, we went to the cafe around 4:30 on a Friday.  The food has always been priced a little high for the quality, but it is a local business and my boss is a local businessman.  He likes to dine other small businesses..  This past visit it was dead empty with the exception of staff.  It was my boss, his young-adult children and a fourteen month old baby and me.  We were seated and enjoying a little of wine, the most expensive bottle on their very limited and impressively unimpressive wine list.  What WAS outrageous was that the horrible way the owner treated us.  Out of nowhere, and I must remind you, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant, the owner came over and demanded we make the baby stop pounding on the table.  ...not my baby, and I'm one of those people who doesn't really like noisy kids, but I'm telling you, that was not the situation.  These were chubby baby hands on the table with a laughing baby...and who were we bothering?  We thought he was joking until we saw the look on his fat face.  My boss said "just pack our food to go". The owner turned around, not even out of earshot of our table and said "that a--hole wants is food to go.  Pack that sh-- up and get him the f--- out of here."  Small wonder the place was empty.  Overpriced food, lousy wine selection and not even a friendly neighborhood atmosphere.  This is a NO GO.

These guys are great.  I was on the road with 500 miles to get home and I decided I needed an oil change.  My car recommends every 10k miles, but I refuse to go more an 5k.  I was at 5600 and it was gnawing at me.  So I called this place from my hotel room and he gave me the price over the phone and also gave me a free car wash.  The price over the phone wasn't fantastic, it was mid to high range.  My synthetic changes are usually around $80.  The truck takes 6.5 quarts so it is always a few dollars higher than their advertised synthetic change rate.  But I did also desperately need to get the salt and sand off of my car from the blizzard I had driven through the night before, so the $10 savings on the car wash for me made the deal a little sweeter.  Also, his demeanor over the phone convinced me that this was the place I would trust with my FJ Cruiser, Sanchez.  Yes, I named my truck.  That's how much I love it and CARE about who touches it.  While sitting in the waiting room I spoke with a few other customers who were in there.  These were long term customers...they had been going to this guy for years.  They all loved him and trusted him.  Even a couple of Bostonian transplants, who are generally distrusting, couldn't say enough nice things.    The owner also came in and spoke with me directly about my car taking a quart and a half more of the synthetic.  Which I knew but had forgotten.  Everything about the place made me feel like they were handling my truck properly.  I can't tell you how different it was from some of the others where I literally stand and watch to make sure they're putting in synthetic and not just charging me for it while dumping in regular oil.  Anyway, they got me right in.  No pressure to sell me anything extra (I knew I didn't need it, but these places always seem to push anyway). They got me in and out quickly, charged me $80 and I was on my way with clean oil and a clean exterior and vacuumed interior.  It made the last 500 that much less tedious.

Well, I can't truly speak to the quality of the salon.  They may be amazing.  Unfortunately I won't ever know because no one answers the phone.  I've tried repeatedly to make an appointment to no avail.  There are great reviews here and I suppose if you're an existing customer and have some super-top-secret number, you're in luck because you will have fewer customers with whom to compete for an appointment.   I find a salon without anyone answering the phones to be highly unprofessional.  If I want my hair done by someone with a home salon, I will enlist my stepdaughter who has a beauty license.  From the other reviews, this place doesn't appear to be inexpensive -- hire a receptionist.  **4 months later the owner responded to my review. I suppose that's the kind of response time you should expect?  It actually kinda proves the point.  Hire a receptionist.

I had no idea one could find Mexican food THIS disappointing in Arizona.  This place wasn't just bad Mexican for Arizona, this would even be considered bad Mexican by Pittsburgh, or maybe even China standards.  Had the meatloaf (which we expected some kind of Mexican twist...) it sounded amazing.  AND the waitress recommended it!  So three people in our party of ten were stuck eating what tasted like meat flavored foam.  My step father ate all of his green enchiladas, but that means little -- he would eat anything someone put in front of him.  When I asked if it was good, he nodded with a "meh" expression on his face.   The drinks were ok.   The tortilla bread service with butter was the highlight.    Not inexpensive but not outrageous.   But if you're in Arizona, WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR SUBSTANDARD MEXICAN FOOD?   Just don't.

I'm a little surprised by the negative reviews for this place.  I moved in a month ago and haven't had any problems at all.  Everything in my three bedroom was basically brand new.  New carpets (I hate carpet but second floor has to have carpet to make less noise downstairs) new stainless appliances, new sinks...all good.  I don't think the bathroom cabinets are new, although they look good.  I only think that because the one in my extra bathroom has a slight stain on one of the cabinet doors.  Speaking of which, I had been given a 48 hour form to fill out with any damage I saw...I didn't notice that until three days later and the ladies in the office were great about letting me file the report late.  My neighbors are all really nice.  Next door has a family that I initially felt looked like they were from the Bayou of Louisiana and there are a lot of people living in a three bedroom -- older parents and three adult kids.  But hey, they have been super friendly and kind to me.  Plus I like the Bayou.   Everyone else I have seen seems young and attractive and vibrant.     It is pretty quiet at night.  I never hear any noise or arguments.  There are several nice pools and they're redoing a couple of them.  The one nearest me seldom has anyone in it, and since I'm a couple of sit ups and crunches away from my beach body that makes me happy.  I don't like crowded pools.  There is mandatory trash service almost every night, so I sit my garbage outside the front door and they come and pick it up.  I get a LOT of packages so I put the boxes outside too and they have never complained about picking up a mountain of my trash...that is huge for me because I get tired of carrying that stuff to the dumpster.  The grass is dead.  But it is 108 right now so maybe they water that more in the cooler months.  We shall see.     My carport is almost directly outside of my place.  I walk all over at night because it is too hot during the day.  I haven't ever felt unsafe.  I am a single woman and haven't had any issues at all.    I'd give it five stars, but this isn't a five star place...yet.  The new management company is apparently striving to get it there.  But my apartment is beautiful and I am really enjoying it here.

Standard Denny's fare.  SLOOOOOW SERVICE.  I came in at 4:30 am and a lot of people sitting around with no food, tables sitting with dirty plates and glasses. The bar was filthy too.  Clearly understaffed.  A woman came in finally and they started to catch up.   I got my food a little after 5:00 so that sucked.    24 hours should mean you can expect at least some minimum level of service.    Otherwise the place was just Denny's.

Ok food.  I have been here 4-5 times since I moved here.  I like diners and this feels like an old time diner.  The food is edible if not great.    Today however will be my last visit.  The way I was  treated by the hostess made me turn around and leave.  I was headed for becoming a regular in spite of the fair to middling food and prices.  But she gave me the push I needed to find something better.  For these prices, I can definitely do better

Seriously disappointed by the coffee - in an old fashioned coffee house?  The coffee looks like tea.  When you ask for stronger coffee they try to up sell you their espresso.  Feel ripped off much?  This place is off the list.  Food is mediocre. The service starts at bad and goes downhill from there.   They're crazy busy and you'll wait forever to sit, so they are making their money off of tourists who think this is an old fashioned diner.  It is relatively clean, so I give them a star for that.

Well HUGE disappointment.  Really NOT good food.    Pizza with tomatoes and spinach sounded awesome.  It might have been good if not delivered ice cold and soggy an hour later.  Actually, no...it was pretty flavorless even when we reheated it.  A single pizza with a side of Mac and cheese $40 plus a tip.  The Mac and cheese was literally a few noodles and some watery cheese sauce.  VERY Gross.    It seems that many of the positive reviews are from post-party people. I get that.  With enough alcohol anything can pass as good food.  But don't try this garbage sober. You'll wish you were drunk.   Absolutely NOT worth it.  Also, could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers?  Apparently that would have been too great a cost for them to spare a single pack of Parmesan cheese.    I have no problem paying a premium for really good food.  Not the case here.  It is sad when I wish I had ordered cardboard dominos instead -- it would have tasted better and cost half as much.

Fantastic Mexican food at very reasonable prices.  Service is stellar.    Eat outside on the patio if at all possible because the tiny dining room is more of enclosed porch or something and it is not terribly comfortable and VERY loud.  If you're unfortunate enough to show up when a few children are in there -- look out.  It is a yelling contest.  Maybe they could add some different furniture (wooden tables and chairs and tile floors) to absorb some of the sound.  I don't know.  Either way, the food is worth it.    Chicken enchiladas with poblano sauce is the BOMB   CHIMICHANGAS are giant and delicious.   Chips and salsa are fresh and fantastic.    Margaritas will knock you on your a$$ literally.    DO IT

Do NOT be fooled by the updated lobby.  The rooms are disgusting.  I am a frequent Marriott visitor and this is undoubtedly the grossest one I've ever seen.  Did someone run out of toilet paper and drag their butt across the carpet to wipe?  I checked into one room and complained and they gave me another equally as gross.  RUN DOWN is an understatement.    I am toying with finding a different hotel.  I have spent the last two weeks in various Marriotts and this is by far the worst.

Not Marriott standards...or maybe it is.  Marriott seems to be sliding while Hilton is improving.   VERY BAD INTERNET (perhaps to avoid reviews?).   Air conditioner barely works if you're right next to it.  Hot sweaty nights in Phoenix as a result.  Hot water takes forever to get to the shower and the pressure is a trickle.   Two stars because the staff is very nice.   Oh...breakfast blows too.

I am giving t four stars because my boyfriend acted like he had never had food so good.  For me it was more like a three star experience.   We had a couple of buckets of crab legs.  I believe we had queen legs.  We also had calamari.  It was all good.  The boy paid (as it is supposed to be) so I can't speak to cost  The food was fair to good.  I wasn't blown away.  Lots of flies so that was gross.

My favorite buffet in Vegas.  So many good vegetables and meat that I am almost able to control the carb overload that I expect when I see the amazing desserts.   This one offers reservations so DEFINITELY plan the day before so you can skip the loooong lines and lengthy waits.  You will walk right in with a reservation just like the high rollers.

Very good, not amazing or anything, but definitely very good fast Chinese food.  Ordered this for delivery from my hotel room.  They were the only place left open at 10:15 that delivered.  They told me it would be 45 minutes for my food, but I swear it was at my door in under 20...delivered by drones I wonder?   I had crispy orange shrimp which was pretty good.  The crab ran goons were very good.    Don't be afraid to try this place.  Prices were great.  Delivery and service seemed awesome.

Four star eats but they get an extra star for seriously nice customer service and attitude.    My husband is a royal pain at times for restaurants - ordering in advance, insisting on rapid service, etc.  In his defense it usually works out really well and he makes our life awesome.  BUT, I can see where restaurant staff would be like "wtf". Anyway, he ordered to go and then we showed up and decided to eat in.  They unpacked the food and gave us great service without any complaints or problems even though over the phone he had insisted they have it ready in 3 minutes. (Lol).   Then he asked for ice for the free mango lassi and it took FOREVER.  He was starting to get annoyed until we looked over and one of the staff was coming in from outside with two bags of ice.  They actually sent someone out to hurry and get ice for just us (they had just opened).  It was one of those man-did-I-have-the-wrong-idea moments.     We ended up eating here three days in a row, which I am not suggesting but my husband loves tikka masala and he is like a 12 year old who could eat the same thing every day of his life.  The butter chicken, which is basically the same thing, was better than the Tikka masala so he ate that the other two days instead after trying mine.    Everything we ate was good.  Service was stellar.  The place is packed with Indians, so I'm assuming that suggests authenticity although I've not yet visited India.   Hit it!

I was initially a little off put by slow service.  But that was a minor hiccup that was very quickly a memory when I had one of the best banana pancakes of my life.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, I always order scrambled soft and I NEVER get them back the way the first time.  Here I did.  Which is great since Egg is in their name.  So they ought to get it right -- but I've been saying that about Waffle House for years.  Worst waffles on the planet.  Anyway, U.S. Egg lives up to the name.  The sausage was really good too, but not especially noteworthy like the perfect eggs and amazing pancakes.    I returned the following day and couldn't bring myself to try anything different...I will.  Someday.  But I already can't wait for tomorrow for another damn banana pancake.    Everyone is great.  The service aside from the first momentary slowness has been stellar.   And honestly, looking back -- I might have just been hangry.

I'm still going back all of the time and I tried a couple of different things but have returned to and settled on my banana pancake and eggs breakfast -- I get the Jr Triple Play which is half the size of the regular so I have them add one egg   It works out perfectly and is cheaper.  Two sausage, 2 eggs (after I add one) and a single pancake.  Perfect.    ONE NOTE: they use fake butter so you have to request real butter if you don't want to eat nasty chemical margarine.  Unfortunately their margarine is pretty good, but note that it is still fake butter.  That's a bit of a disappointment in my second favorite place -- but they stay busy so apparently most people do t notice or care.

Another five star review.    I am currently out of town for work and my 17 year old son decided last night was a good time to get into some horseplay with his buddy.  Of course he wound up with a tooth broken in half.  Excellent timing.   Fast forward 12 hours, I called and begged this previously-unknown dentist to see my son on a moment's notice -- and "oh yeah doc, I am out of town and have no way to get the kid money or credit cards."  They were booked tight but managed to wedge my kid in anyway.  Bravo for the humanity.  Because my son is a minor and I was hundreds of miles away, they worked with me to pay the bill and sign docs electronically.  Then the doc called me, not once but twice, to break down what was happening and then the final outcome.  He explained it all very clearly and then invited me to call him if I ever have any questions.  What?  Groovy.  My son felt comfortable and said he really likes him.  He fixed the tooth and was extremely fair on his charges.  I was prepared (emotionally if not financially) to drop a couple thousand into my son's mouth over the phone.  But the doctor didn't take advantage of the situation and looked for the least invasive and inexpensive options with a wait-and-see attitude about what we may have to do in the future.  I appreciated that and it made me trust him.  In the end, it was a very inexpensive procedure.  He warned me it could go bigger later, but we can wait and see and hope for the best.   Dealing with this today and finding a new doctor who we can trust was a huge relief.  I believe I have fallen in love with this doctor -- in an "I love the dentist I've never met" kind of way.    Grateful.  Grateful. Grateful.  Thanks Doc.

Divey, run down, cracked vinyl seats on the booths, old.  That being said the Bloody Mary was decent, not amazing.  The service was very good and helpful.  And as other reviewers have most certainly pointed out, the Mac and cheese was amazing.  I DO NOT like pasta or Mac and cheese really at all, but was talked into it.  Yum!  Sweet potato fries were slices rather than the regular long cut and came with a pretty tasty garlic aioli sauce...those were good, really good but a little greasy.  That's all I had here but would definitely recommend for the Mac and cheese.  DEFINITELY.

Great crepes.   We went in at five minutes to 3:00 and they close at 3:00.  They allowed us to stay and were very friendly about serving us.    I had crepes with pulled pork, onions and cheese.  It was quite tasty but moderately greasy.  Which was also not bad.  The crepes were tasty and the pork was flavorful.  My son had a crabby patty (?? Crab cake on a bun...not sure what it was called). It was pretty tasty.  It wasn't the most amazing crab cake I've ever tasted, but it was certainly good.  Cute little trendy diner atmosphere.  Definitely a spot to return for a weekend breakfast or brunch.

How very disappointing.  The room is beautiful, in fact if you remember the Venetian, when it was newer, this place is identical...oh wait, is it the Venetian?    REALLY pretentious prices ($15 for a tiny, not good Bloody Mary in the casino) yet one is still surrounded by the great unwashed population.  Not trendy.  Not cool.  But trying very hard to appear that way.  NO 24 HOUR PLACE TO EAT   Well, there is a bar with a greatly reduced menu overnight.  NO BUFFET which is cool if you're trying to exclude people from the Midwest for whatever reason.  BASICALLY NO INTERNET IN THE ROOM. which can almost be considered a Vegas standard, but this is supposed to be a convention hotel.  COMPLETELY INCONVENIENT    Won't stay again.  $300 a night to be annoyed, underserved and unimpressed.   I will say the view was very pretty.   My non-smoking room smelled like one of the little old ladies chain smoking menthols had followed me home and sat on the bed next to me all night.  GROSS

I am struggling to give this four stars.  Really solid 3+ and I'm feeling generous.   Had a Blue Burger.  It was good. They certainly didn't skimp on the meat, the blue or the fixins.  The hamburger was a bit dry however and I wasn't blown away by the service or the food.  I may go back, but I'm in no big hurry.  Not really noteworthy.

Super groovy looking laundromat.  I am lazy so I drop my stuff off at the fluff and fold.  Around $1 a pound as I recall and my laundry is cleaned and drifted and folded and smells like a fantastic drier sheet.    Great service.  The whole place is clean.  Not sure what "Eco" means, I didn't see any solar panels or turbines -- oh wait.  I bet it is economy.  Never mind.  And yeah, the fluff and fold is inexpensive.

Massive portions.  Food was good enough.  Went with my boy and he's a big eater.  Even he couldn't finish.  Prices reasonable. Vegas used to have great late night options, but they're dwindling as casinos turn to fast food mall-style eateries for after hours.   I hate it. But this place is a bit of the good old days.   Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.

Meh.  I wanted a salad but was given that choice between "both kinds of lettuce". Romaine or iceberg.  So I went with a burger that I ordered medium and it actually came out medium -- but was still so damn dry and chewy it was nearly inedible.    This is a great place to go if you're on a diet.  Nothing is so good that you'll have any trouble controlling yourself.  All kidding aside, there really isn't anything that looks even remotely good on the menu.  There also does not appear to be even one healthy choice, so the diet thing actually won't work.   As I said, the choices are slim and don't ask for anything extra because the kitchen is three floors away so your food will be cold before whatever you asked for arrives.

I needed a small space to store some things while I am away in China for a few weeks.  While there, the woman working suggested I ought to park at the storage facility while I am gone. I ended up renting a full garage space where I can park my car for a month while away and take the train right from there to the airport.  It is going to save me a month of parking out in the desert sun while I am gone, not to mention how much more expensive that parking would be in addition to the space I was already renting. THEN she mentioned that I can have packages delivered there and put into storage while I am away!  I am a product sourcing agent and the ability to have samples shipped and stored there saved me yet another stop at some kind of UPS store or something to accomplish that same thing.  I am so happy I could pop.    I feel like a jerk for not remembering her name (it is late and I'm old and tired) but she was really friendly and helpful.  She had just moved here from Oregon or Washington or somewhere cooler (temp wise) like that.  What a great time and worry saver she turned out to be. I will probably continue to rent the space long beyond the one month I originally planned because the whole thing is so convenient and awesome that I am beyond pleased.    My space is clean and convenient and I will have no problem parking inside or working and keeping samples there in the coming months.

Having never eaten here and seeing the most recent review was less than stellar, I was hesitant.  In fact we weren't going to order at all.  But I didn't want to leave the house and we wanted Thai and, and, and...so we took a chance.  Pad Thai, Pumpkin Curry, Fresh Rolls (summer rolls) and crab rangoons for the kid.  All were EXCELLENT.   The pumpkin curry was ordered spicy and it was perfect,  the summer rolls were really fresh and tasty.  There was a ton of food  it was only me and my 16 year old son -- but he eats every meal as if it is his first and last.  There are still enough to eat today for another mean.  It was around $40 for all of it, which is a fair price.  I don't know why e last person had a bad experience, maybe we got lucky.  But I would definitely order from here the next time I'm visiting the burgh.

The food we tried was really good -- we shared three appetizers.  One was some kind of cheesy corn au gratin thing...can't remember but it was amazing.  We had a flatbread little pizza thing that was pretty off the hook too.  And some Korean fried cauliflower.  Very good.  3 Friends:  2 cosmos 2 glasses of house wine 1 Bloody Mary 3 appetizers  Just barely under $100.   I thought it was a bit steep, but maybe I'm just old and out of touch?  My friends seemed a little shocked too though.   The waiter was a doll.  He took care of us and laughed at all of my stupid jokes -- and he managed to look like he wasn't annoyed by having to fake it.  Tip: $30.  I appreciate a man who can fake it well.

Very careful and understanding of my temperamental mutt.  They did her nails and anal glands as part of the service - including filing the nails, not just cutting.  They also brushed her teeth and MAN did that help the ride home.  Check in and the first visit teeth brushing is free.  My old girl looks young and puppy-like again.  No one complained about her behavior like the last salon and I KNOW she's a pain when being groomed.  I appreciated their professionalism and gentle treatment of my less than perfect pooch.

I am a little surprised by the tepid reviews.   We have eaten here almost every time we visit Vegas -2 or 3 times a year.  My whole group of friends loves it; it is a highlight of our visit - frequently the place where our group plans our first reunion meetings after everyone's flights land.  The staff is exceedingly helpful and friendly.  Whenever anyone has a problem, they've rushed to make it right -- we are a bunch of middle aged broads, not high rollers.  The last visit they seated us inside but immediately relocated us to their gorgeous outdoor seating upon our request.   Anyway, if you go be sure to try any of the pastas.  They are always perfect and off the chain good.  The sauces are delicious and there's never too, little nor too much, they got pasta DOWN.  This visit my husband was with me so we also split a big ribeye steak.  Damn. It was seasoned perfectly.  My husband is extremely picky and hates to pay full price for anything, so the food better be good or he gets very annoyed.  He was blown away by the steak.  It was dry aged and cooked perfectly.  We paired it with spinach which was perfect.  He also despises vegetables but he ended up eating well over half the big side of spinach without even blinking.    In addition to amazing dinner, great service, groovy Ferraris all over the place, they also do a breakfast.  The breakfast won't blow your mind like dinner, but it is very reasonably priced and blows that crappy Denny's on the strip away.

One of those awesome little coffee shops.   Great coffee, good prices.  A real find in this area.  Funky, groovy and hip.  All good.    They sell beads too -- not into it, but it adds to the funky atmosphere.

OK those were the best shrimp tamales I've ever had in my life.  Perhaps the only shrimp tamales I've ever had -- but they were OFF THE CHAIN.   We had the pig wings and taco toes (spell check refuses the real spelling) they were very good but my Mexican husband claimed the filling was too spiced -- not hot spicy but too much of the flavor   $32 for everything.  Whut?!?

Two haircuts for the two men in my life.  Both look excellent.  We came in and it was swamped but they worked us in anyway.    This place is a cool old fashioned barber shop, including a quick massage.   And they're definitely not racist.   #BOOM

I walked in looking tired and old and had pretty much given up on life - ok, that's not true but at 115 degrees, doesn't everyone give up just a little?    Anyway, 1.5 hours later I am cut and colored and so ridiculously good looking that it just isn't fair to the rest of the ladies.  Sorry, you'll have to deal with it now.    This was my first time at this shop - I travel all over for work and find myself getting overdue haircuts in back alleys from sketchy strangers.  Anyway, this place is awesome.  The color lightened and lifted my entire face.  It looks natural (although I think she could do some crazy color work if I wasn't so damn old).  My husband is like "whut!?! You coulda looked like this all along?  Nah!"  Definitely recommend.  Now I am finished - I have to get back to sitting around and being smokin' sexy hot.

Great black and blue burger at a very friendly food truck.   The sweet potato fries were spot on.   I don't know how it is price wise because I got a free burger.  But I would have paid a premium it was so fantastic.

My only experience with this place is being left on hold forever.  So, they may be fabulous but me and my wallet calling someone else.  Too bad -- I just moved here and this place could have been convenient.  Obviously they have enough customers.

Doh!   I was hoping I had made a rash decision with my first failure here.  So I called again yesterday and I was put on hold FOREVER.  What is the secret password for someone to help a customer?  Do I need to "know someone" to be treated like a  human?  Come on, is there a poker game going on in the back because clearly they have no need for new customers.

The food was good...not off the hook, but solid.  It always throws me to order Thai food from a Chinese place.  But whatever.  The hot and sour soup was both hot and sour.  The chicken curry (thai) was tasty but not mind blowing.  The crab rangoons were pretty standard.    The reason I am giving this place four stars instead of the solid three it deserves is because I was ridiculously sick and even though the delivery guy wasn't on the clock yet, they delivered food to me...oh heck, I am giving them five stars.  For Boulder City, this beats Panda Express all day long.  So this is the place if you want Chinese (or Thai) food.  I haven't gone into the place yet, but I will when I'm not so sick.

Brought my beloved FJ Cruiser in here with something leaking from it -- turns out it was the radiator.  What a drag!  But the owner was great and tried to fit us in immediately.  I ended up just coming back the next day because I wasn't in a huge hurry -- but it was nice to know that he would have bent over backwards to get us taken care of.  We replaced the radiator with an aftermarket that has a lifetime warranty.  The truck is like new.  I felt like we got great service and a fair deal.  We will definitely come back when other work needs to take place.

Well, I so desperately want to give this place 4 or even 5 stars.  Maybe I will eventually, but for now I have to go with two.   We ordered through eat24 and were given a delivery time of an hour.  An hour and fifteen minutes later I called to check and was told that our food should be here "any minute". Fifteen minutes later, I called again.  It came a few minutes later -- ice cold and kind of ruined.  The crepe was wet and cold from steaming in the box, condensing and then raining back down on the cooling crepe.  The French dip was just cold, still edible.  We microwaved it and revived it somewhat.  It was pretty good except that it came with a tiny cup of au jous that wasn't sufficient for even half of the sandwich, let alone a sandwich that had been microwaved and toughened up a little.  But it was still very good.  The spinach salad was a bit of a shock considering there wasn't a single leaf of spinach in it.  It was nothing but arugula with some tomatoes and walnuts (no Gorgonzola as listed either). However, it was fresh and the dressing was good.    The price was decent.  And I have to say that when I called a few times trying to track down my dinner, the staff was very nice and apologetic.  They explained that they had let the driver go home early and then were slammed with 30 orders.  So I can understand that ---- happens.  The food that we received was subpar, but definitely suggested that if served hot or not rushed (maybe he didn't realize how he was screwing up the spinach salad) I think it would be pretty damn good.  We will try it again someday and perhaps update with the review I think this place could achieve.

This place was worth a second chance -- I suspected it would be.  Really great food.  The delivery was prompt the second time and the food was hot.  They treated us to a replacement for the initial screw up and we ordered the same thing.  It was perfect the second time.  Previous Review:  Well, I so desperately want to give this place 4 or even 5 stars.  Maybe I will eventually, but for now I have to go with two.

Um, seriously?  This is the 24 hour choice for Paris?  What happened to the all night steak and egg diners of Vegas past?   Woke up hungry after midnight and this or pizza were the only choices.  I had wanted to try this place anyway, so why not -- but no, never again.  Pulled pork French fries sounded great.  Well, if you like a big nasty lump of goo all glued together with cheese curds and swamped in some kind of nasty almost barbecue almost mayo/gravy.  Repulsive.  Literally tasted like something a small child would make by mixing every leftover in the refrigerator.   Clam chowder that came with the dry nasty salmon tasted like a dirty fish tank.  The salmon tasted old and way too fishy.  Gross.    The burger turned out to be almost decent, hence the 2 stars instead of negative 5 stars I would have given it for EVERYTHING else.  If you're starving to death in the middle of the night and have ABSOLUTELY no other choice than this place, at least don't waste your time on the other swill --have the $20 burger that is almost as good as Wendy's or Burger King. Almost.    Way overpriced for this crap. -- There actually is not a price low enough for this place. I would pass it up if they were giving away food actually -- Even though one expects overpriced on the strip.  Next time we will uber to the all night taco place or the Peppermill.

Second visit.  Excellent service.  Very clean.  Everyone is very nice and they worked to get us in quickly without hurrying other customers.  They did and excellent job both times...my friend from out of the country was impressed as well.  $20 pedicure. $25 gel manicure (which I don't get) can't be beaten.   This is my new go to for anything nails.

I'm married to a Mexican who has very high expectations for his Mexican food.  This place measured up.   We had the poerco pibil (I believe).  And, according to my husband it was just right -- not "kill the cook" good, but very good.    Happy hour drink prices were great.  Also, be sure to check in on Yelp because you get some kind of discount coupon.  However happy hour prices actually beat the coupon so save it for unhappy hours.   This place delivers but unfortunately they charge a $10 delivery fee -- so we choose to not order.  Otherwise we would be ordering all of the time.
