Great pizza it is; Chicago-style it is NOT.  Seems strange to me that Chicagoans claim this as "Chicago Style" pizza.  Oh well - moving on.  Their sausage is some of the best I've had outside of Chicago - without question.  The pizza is great - topping selection is great - the crust is good and I love their sweet marinara.  The service is sometimes lacking... it can be slow and inattentive.

I find myself having dreams about this pizza... It is that good!  I feel sorry for people who continue to frequent places like Dominos, Papa Johns and Pizza Hut.    Most of all - I'm absolutely THRILLED that they have a location in the Tuke.  Unfortunately - like all their locations they don't take reservations so either get their early, plan on a 25-45 minute wait or get takeout.  Whatever the case - don't forgo this pizza!!!

A big Saturday for Little Miss and I as we tried to cram in as many errands as we possibly could in one day. After mommy-daughter haircuts, we were famished and - as mommy is wont to do - I Yelped to see where a good place for breakfast would be. Chase's Diner fit the bill - and as luck would have it, it was next door to my next appointment! So we hopped in the Ferrari of Minivans and off we went to mommy's old stomping grounds in Planet Chandler.   The place is bright, lively, clean and oh-so reminiscent of the places my parents used to tell me about. They call themselves a "diner" and they are a "diner" to a T! (or d?).   We were greeted immediately and decided to counter it. The service was spot on! Waters were promptly delivered. We shared the Denver Omelet and it was perfect!!! Fluffy eggs, veggies with a crisp still in them (PERFECT!) and plentiful with ham. The hashbrowns were perfect! The toast, perfect!! There is absolutely NOTHING WRONG with this place. It's perfect!!! And the M. family will be back - for sure!

Have been here a couple of times, not by choice.  I thought the place was pretty filthy for a restaurant... actually it was pretty filthy for a backroads gas station restroom.  Bugs all over the floor, dirt, grime and a smell.  The food was OK at best - certainly not the best Mex food around; not the best Mex food on Chandler Boulevard for that matter.  As I am known to do, I checked out their report on Maricopa County's restaurant ratings site.  WHOAH!!!!!!  Mind you this was a while ago but I pretty much put my foot down and decided not to go there.

The lunch specials are awesome.  You get plenty of food for a very small amount of scratch.  However... Chicago Style, it is not.  Not even close.  Regardless, it's a good little place if you're on a budget and cravin some pizza.

FINALLY - a sit-down place @ Promenade that knows how to handle a lunch-time business crowd.  We were in awe watching everyone move and dance and flutter around the dining room like a well-rehearsed balet.  It was amazing!  Within 40 seconds of sitting down, we had salad, wontons and water in front of us.  All in all, we were in and out of there in about 35 minutes.  Flo - PLEASE go to your neighbors at Pasta Primo and show them how it's done!  As far as the food is concerned, perfect lunch sized portions.  I had the pepper bacon shrimp (or something to that effect) and it was very tasty.  My co-worker thought it was spicy peppers, but it was coarsely ground black peppercorns.  A unique flavor and very well put together.  My co-worker had the garlic chicken and she was happy with the dish.    All in all, a positive lunch experience @ Promenade.  They know how to do lunch there at Flo's!

Simply the best!  The dogs are grilled, NOT BOILED so they have that awesome "backyard" taste to them.  Avoid lunch rush or you'll be in line for a very long time.  But if you have the time, it's well worth it to see your dog cooked right before your eyes and dressed the way YOU want it.

The menu is almost identical to Chuckbox... even the burger names.  I've been trying to find out if OHW & CB are "related" or just shockingly similar.   Went there for the first time yesterday for an early dinner with friends.  Love the "shabby" decor - the ancient cig machine by the front door was bitchen.    The burger was great - although Chuckbox is a wee bit better, in my opinion.  You can taste the smoke on the meat better at Chuckbox.  Plus CB has this excellent hot sauce... OHW just had Tabasco.    We didn't enjoy the outside accomodations but they looked really nice - patio seating, games, etc.  It was just too cold yesterday.  The bar was separate so it's definately a kid-friendly place.  We decided to get a milkshake after my friend's little boys came back with one that was so dark and chocolatey looking.  Never seen one so chocolatey looking!  I was shocked at the price ($5.41!!!!) but have to say (and my husband agreed) that it was well worth it.  Definately the BEST chocolate milkshake I've ever had.  And worth the $5+ pricetag.

I've been a member for over a year and every experience I've had has been positive.  Their online banking and billpay is extremely user-friendly.  They linked a savings account I setup for my daughter so that I can see her account (and transfer money to it) when I log in to my own account.  I have several "club" accounts where I can designate money for specific purposes.  The best part is I am earning better interest here than anywhere else - INCLUDING ING!    I made up my mind to quit B of A once and for all after they took billions in bailout money (MY taxpayer money) then turned around and announced ANOTHER fee for ME (customer).  All the while, top management there was making annual salaries that I'll never see in a lifetime.  What really impressed me was receiving a call on Sunday from the credit union after my husband's particularly busy weekend (his "honeydo" list was a mile long).  The CU recognized it as an anomoly based on his past card useage and called him and asked him if he was indeed making all those card purchases.    I strongly recommend AZSTCU.  If you don't go with them, go with ANY credit union... as long as you leave greedy corporate banks who don't care about you.

It's shameful how "downhill" this place has gone.  I used to be a huge fan when the Sirrine's owned it.  I'll stick to Rancho de Tia Rosa (which IS owned by the Sirrine's) next time.    The service was PAINFULLY slow.   Now, I could understand that years ago when I used to go and it took 45 minutes to an hour just to get a table.  But when only 4 or 5 tables are filled there's NO EXCUSE for poor service.    The salsas used to be SO MUCH BETTER and more flavorful.  They are a hint of their former selves.  The salsa verde - previously a stand-out in the green salsa category - is mediocre at best... and that's a tremendous compliment.  Oddly enough -the chips are still some of the best I've ever, ever, ever had.    The food - like the salsas - is a shadow of its former self.  It lacks the succulence, the flavor, and the wow-factor it had when Dennis Sirrine was calling the shots.  It's bland, slightly dry and just not there anymore.  What was equally disappointing is they've replaced their iced tea (something used to drive across town for) to a horrible concentrate.  Blech.    Considering this place used to be packed to the gills on a Tuesday afternoon at 2pm and now you can easily walk in on Friday at dinner time and have your pick of tables, the restaurant needs to recognize the issue and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  They absolutely cannot go on like this.

Sigh... I'm done with Rosa's.  Went there on Thursday and ordered something I am very used to ordering.  It was bland and uninspiring.  The salsas - forget it... you'd be better off smuggling in a bottle of Herdez.  Chips?  Bland and stale.  The waiter was very quick, though - gotta hand it to them on that.

Just had lunch there.  We were seated right away and given water right away but after that, it seems like we were forgotten.  It's no wonder - it seems there was only one waitress doing all the work.  She was very attentive when she actually had time for us.  I don't "blame" her one bit - for a place as popular as Uncle Sal's, it seems management should be aware of how many servers they need on staff.  I dunno - maybe somebody called in sick.  At any rate - I got the chicken Scarpariello and it was outstanding.  Wonderful flavor, expertly cooked.  The "joint" was quaint and neighborly - I bet it has a great vibe at night.  The decor was so very 30 years ago - which was awesome.  It reminds me of the little places where the husband and wife are in the back cooking, all the kids are servers and the old grandma who only speaks Italian is in back stirring a pot of gravy.  Sigh... memories...  Only people who truly appreciate what it means to eat at a family restaurant will "get" this place.  It's sad that so many people hold Olive Garden or some other God-awful chain in such high regard as to grade everyone else according to that standard.    Good job, Uncle Sal's - you impressed me!

We walked in on a Saturday night and were shocked to see a relatively empty house. There were basically two large groups and us. By the end of our dinner, however, the place was fairly full. Great location once you can find it. Pretty outdoors - I bet fall/spring dining on the patio is nice.   We had a coupon and I did review the prices and menu prior to us going there. Based on previous experiences with these types of coupons, it's safe to say that restaurants offer them because they need to.  DÃ©cor - It IS dated but it's not as "gross" as some people posting here make it out to be. We didn't notice any odors other than that of the food.  Service - Rafael, the owner, greeted and seated us. Yes, he's dour but talk to the guy a little and you find he's quite friendly. As for our waitress, she was welcoming, helpful, quick and attendtive. There was another woman who served our food and she was equally warm and helpful.  Food - I admit I expected a little more because of the prices we were paying. We got one of the shrimp tapas that was very tasty along with crusty bread and aolli. My husband thought his paella was a little dry - indeed when it was being served, it was almost scraped out of the paella pan. It had a nice flavor though and he enjoyed it other than it being dry. I had the pork leg dinner which was very nicely done. I was afraid the "sour orange" would be the only flavor coming through but was pleasantly surprised to find the dish had a wonderul, well-rounded flavor with sour orange in the background. The meat was tender. The rice was flavorful and moist. The fresh veggies were expertly done and still had a snap to them. I hate it when restaurants overcook fresh veggies.  Sangria - We liked it but we don't have much to compare it to. I could taste the fresh mint in the background. It wasn't too wine-y and wasn't too juice-y.   Atmosphere - We were there on a Saturday which meant live music and flamenco dancing. We were expecting a guy with a guitar and a girl dancing. What we got was an education on flamenco! I learned a lot from the head dancer's explanations.    We'll return.

Wow - can't believe how many people are rating this low because THEY "thought" it was a Mexican restaurant "because of the name" and were disappointed when they discovered it to be a steak place.  Uh... think much??????  Anyway...  Date night arrives and lo and behold I see that Monti's is participating in Restaurant Week with a special menu.  Monti's has been a family favorite for a couple of decades and, up to this point, I had never taken my husband of 3.5 years there.    We had early (5:15) reservations for a Saturday night.  The parking lot was fairly full and there were a few couples standing around in the lobby; when we checked in, we were told it would be a 15 minute wait.  I said "Uh... for reservations???"  The young gal quickly admitted her mistake and we were promptly seated in the fountain room (which, coincidentally, was empty - as well as the other 2 rooms we saw... not sure why there would have been a 15 minute wait... but I digress...)  Our waitress was FANTASTIC.  She was the embodiment of what you want your servers to be:  knowledgeable, excited about the food, honest, willing to engage the customers, offer suggestions, etc.    Naturally, our meal started off with the famed Roman bread; it didn't disappoint!!  My husband ordered the Spinach/Artichoke Dip - obviously freshly made with freshly blanched spinach (not that frozen crap).  It was different because of the guacamole and red pepper flakes - what an interesting combination!  With my prix fixe, I had the "Chicken Adobe Tinga Style" and it was FABULOUS!!!  Nicely done, Monti's!  Next on my menu was the Espresso Rubbed Filet.  It was expertly cooked.  It was served with "Chorizo Potato Hash" which, while tasty, I felt that it was too strongly flavored and took away from the filet.  The "Fig Salsa Frita" was a wonderful accompaniment to the steak, offering a sweet flavor to offset the richness of the steak.  For the dessert course, I had the "Vanilla Bean Arroz con Leche with Cajeta Churros" which, despite its fancy moniker, was quite bland and unimaginative.  It was missing something.    My husband ordered the ribeye which he said was the best he's ever eaten in a restaurant and forced him to vow never to BBQ a steak again - ONLY in a cast iron pan!

As I write this review, I am still waiting to poop this abomination out of my body in order to feel some semblance of normalcy. Rare is the day when you're driving down the road and DON'T see an "Im Addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips" bumper sticker. However, as a native Canadian who has been in the States for over 30 years and Arizona for about 27 years, I had yet to eat fish & chips below the 49th parallel. My husband, a Bay Area transplant, had a hankering' for some fish and chips and thought - "what better place to try than the one advertised on many a back bumper?" So off we went in the Ferrari of minivans...  My husband asked how big the pieces of fish were - after all, you could get 4 pieces for under $7 - how big could they be? "About the size of a fish sandwich" said the guy behind the counter. that should have been our first clue.Both of us are used to pieces of fish being of the plate-sized variety.  We didn't get "fish and chips". What we got was a mystery substance covered in cracker-meal then flash frozen for God knows how long before it's dropped in grease. EVERYTHING lacked flavor, except for the ketchup+Tapatio known as "Pete's Sauce".  The "shrimp" - like the "fish" - was of questionable origin... about as authentic as the "Rolex" you can get from the guy with the trench coat in New York. The fries were bland - totally tasteless. Not sure what was in that plastic packet that claimed to be "Malt Vinegar".    If the Mother Country knew these yokels were wearing the Union Flag on the backs of their uniform shirts, we'd be thrust into war with her, for certain!  The whole experience forced me back into my Canada Rule. Never again.   Really deserves no (or negative) stars... but Yelp won't let me grade that low.

Wish I could give it NO stars.  My mother's dragged me in to this place many times as she likes to shop here.  I always felt like no matter where I was, what I was doing, people were flying at me like I wasn't there - NO respect for personal space.  I could be picking out tomatoes or browsing the cheeses and I would LITERALLY pushed out of the way by some stinky hippy.    The last time I shopped there was the LAST STRAW.  My mother had BEGGED me to pick up an exclusively Trader Joe's item for a dinner party she was having.  TJ's is very close to my house.  I reluctantly agreed.  Since I knew exactly what she needed, I told my husband to drop my fat, sweaty, pregnant ass off in the front and I'd hobble in there to get the 2-3 items my dear mummy wanted.  Again with the people rushing at me.  Oy vey!!!    I'm standing in a line that had 3-4 people in it holding my items, sweat dripping off my brow and my 9 month pregnant belly growing by the minute.  The young man in the checkout line next to me says "Excuse me ma'am, I can take you here".  I smiled and as I was hobbling over there, some ASSHOLE rushed up to the checkout counter and dumped all his organic crap on the conveyor.  The clerk SAID AND DID nothing. I said "Uh EXCUSE me?  He asked ME to come over."  Both ignored me.  I dropped my three items on the ground (two of which were in glass jars that shattered) and said "FUCK YOU, FUCK THIS PLACE, I'M NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN" and walked out.    And that was the last time Trader Joe's got any of my money.

I've been coming to Wong's for almost 20 years and the place looks the same. I really wish they were able to do a little updating. I'm sure the physical appearance of the place turns some people off... which is a shame, because their food is SO LEGIT.  For the first time ever, I tried the friend chicken (half) with garlic sauce... while the chicken was a tad overcooked, it was very, VERY good! The garlic sauce... I'm dreaming about it now. So sweet and salty! You could smear it on a shoe and I'd eat it!  Anyway - if you're looking for amazing Chinese food, give Wong's a try... look beyond the 1990 decor and trust me on this.  You won't regret it!

At long last - a pizza joint that calls themselves "New York Style" and they're ACTUALLY RIGHT!!!  There's nothing "fancy" about these slices, but trust me - having eaten at several "hole in the wall" joints in NYC - including @ the subway stations - this is IT.  This is New York pizza to a tee.    Very friendly staff.  I only wish the place was bigger to accommodate the crowd.  The $3.50 lunch deal is a STEAL and they don't skimp on the size of the slices.  It's a tad on the greasy side, which lends to its authenticity as New York style pizza.

Great food - the salsa is flavorful spicy without being too hot.  The food is innovative yet authentic.  One thing I've learned is that if you get served "orange cheese" you're not in a REAL Mexican restaurant!  The service can be lacking at times, but generally they are on top of things and - especially for lunch - they can get you in and out of there fairly quickly.

An important life lesson was learned by us last night: never eat at an empty buffet. Also, it's time to cutoff my husband from the restaurant choices. I should have known better when we pulled up in the Ferrari of Minivans - the parking lot was relatively empty at 6pm on a weeknight. My next hint should have been the overwhelming barnyard smell upon walking in.   Let's get to the plusses - because there aren't many and it won't take much time. Plus 1: service was great - the lady there was very friendly and quick to fill our waters. Plus 2: the place is huge and can accommodate large groups. Plus 3: the bathrooms were pretty clean and modern except for something I will highlight below. Plus 4: large selection of food... except...  Now for the minuses... First off, the place is downright filthy. Filthy, filthy, filthy!!! The floors looked like someone rebuilt a Chevy Big Block on them... years and years (decades?) of ground in dirt that had never - EVER been cleaned. Yuck. The food, while plentiful, was not very fresh, save for a few items. I tried the pepper salt blue crab and it was mushy... same with the regular crab legs and a couple of the boiled shrimp. The friend shrimp was great, however. the Chinese short ribs... I bet these are simply awesome right out of the cooker, but these ones had clearly been sitting around way too long. Same with the bourbon chicken and the chicken on a stick. A lot of hte cooked veggies were either soft and mushy or rubbery. The noodles seemed OK. My husband loved the fried chicken, but he was lucky enough to get some right after it was brought out. I had a bite and agree - it was very good fresh. A lot of the items, especially fruits and vegetables - seemed right out of a can. Disappointing. The hot butter (for seafood) was of the "I Can't Believe It's Not" variety. Blech!  The sushi... oh my God!! If there's ONE THING a restaurant should not put out for any length of time, it's sushi... for the love of God!!! Not sure why I tried it, but I had one bite... even the texture of the rice was enough to turn my stomach!!  The desserts - nearly everything was stale.   Overall, disappointing, other than the service. It's too bad - a nice Chinese buffet would be an awesome thing to have close at hand.

Went for our 2nd time on Sunday.  The place was P-A-C-K-E-D yet they were able to get our order to us quickly.  The servers get the tables cleaned very quickly so there wasn't much of a wait for an open table.    For the second time, I got the egg sandwich on ciabatta and it was fantastic.  I'm not used to ciabatta being so soft and chewey - normally it's toasted until it's rock hard.  This is soft enough for my 18 month old daughter to eat (and she calls it "balabala".)  My husband got the carne adovada again and it was amazing.  Spicier this time than the last.  It's served with toast... some of the best wheat bread I've tasted.  My mother ordered one of the wraps and was very pleased with it.    My only gripe is their coffee is weak.  But then again, I like a strong cup of coffee and it's extremely rare that I order coffee outside of my home - nobody makes it right - you eather have it too weak or it's burned to a crisp (ala Charbucks).    This place is close to home so we will return.  P.S. - there's interesting local art on the walls.  I've been meaning to ask if any of it is for sale.  I love supporting local small businesses and artists.

I'm surprised at two of the reviews.  My experiences with this doctor have all been positive.  He asks plenty of questions and offers good advice.  The office staff seems helpful and attentive.  Dr. Parikh, unlike my previous doctors, seems to have some pretty cool "gadgets" as well to test minor maladies.  I've never had any problems with this doctor or his staff.

Close to home and VERY affordable.  It's definately a "sufficient" child care place for those of us on a budget.  They seem to be a little "behind the times" technologically but I guess you get what you pay for.  There are plenty of toys and activities to keep your child busy throughout the day and I get a general sense that the teachers love their jobs and care very well for the children.  At least the younger ones.  I'm a little shocked at how much some of the teachers in the older kids classes yell at the kids.    We are kept informed as to our child's daily activities and they are very accommodating to us on the very few occasions when our daughter has to stay a few minutes beyond the 10 hour day (which has happened 3X in the past year).  My one complaint is the parking lot.  People think they can put their cars anywhere for any amount of time.  I'm surprised more accidents haven't occurred there.  There could be 4 parking spaces open and STILL parents will park in the fire lane or right out in the middle of the lot.  I feel that the business should be more on top of this and letting parents know that the fire lane is for emergencies only and that if there are no parking spaces available (which is RARE), show them where they need to park.    Overall - it's a great place and I feel like our child is doing very well here.

Sad to learn that there are only 2 Pho places near the office... North Scottsdale developers are you listening? Enough of the chains! Enough of the fast food! Enough of the same old same old!  But I digress...  It was a small, clean comfortable restaurant situated next to a carwash. Now that I know where it is - I won't forget ;0)  The employees are very fast, friendly and helpful. We were promptly seated, given water within a couple of minutes and our water was back to get our order quickly.  Two of us got the Pho (one meatball, one steak) and the other in our party got the lemongrass chicken.   I'm relatively new to the Pho craze, but I have to say this is by far the best I've had. And it was all in the broth. So full of flavor you could literally taste the hours and hours of work put into it. The steak was perfect!! My colleague wasn't crazy about her meatballs and vowed to try the steak next time.   The three of us split an order of the spring rolls which were amazing.   I can't say enough about the broth - like crust on a pizza - the broth makes or breaks the Pho.   We will DEFINITELY be back!

Stranded at the office with NO vehicle, not enough time to make lunch @ home and nothing within walking distance. Delivery to the rescue! My old standby is sadly closed and soon to be sold.   Now that I've ordered/eaten from this place, I'm pretty sure my husband used to rave about them.  Online ordering through a third party website is super simple. The delivery showed up just as I was thinking "Gee, I wonder where my food is??"  They seem to have a nice selection of both cold and warm sandwiches. I ordered the Italian. The bread is pillowy soft and fresh and fresh can get. They obliged my "not too much mayo" request perfectly. All meat and veggies are very super awesome tasty fresh - and they use leafy green leaf lettuce, not iceberg (yeah!!!).   High quality, fresh, tasty food at a great price - and delivery! I'll definitely be ordering again.

Ambience = A++; It really is a beautiful setting and the perfect place to go when the weather turns nice.  We even drove around the neighborhood a bit to get the lay of the land.  I hadn't been in that area since it was all farmland in the 80s.    Food = B; We both had burgers.  There really wasn't anything special about them, which is not to say they weren't good... they were.  I'm more than willing to go there again and try something different - something more "authentically Joe's".  The fries were again, unimpressive.  The drinks were a little on the bland side; my first go was a Dr. Pepper which was flat.    Service was relatively quick for how many people were there.  My husband said the bathrooms were pretty awesome.

I felt the prices were steep considering its SUSHI.  I've had far better for a far lower cost.  Don't get me wrong - I won't hesistate to drop a couple of benjamins if the meal is worth it.  But this was NOT worth it.  I find myself hungry after less than 2 hours.  It also took an inordinate amount of time for our food to arrive.  Good thing our watiress was at our table less than a minute after we walked in and took our order quickly.    Speaking of the waitress... while she was very friendly and attentive, she ABSOLUTELY REEKED of some sickly sweet perfurme.  It turned my stomach and quite possibly ruined the meal for me.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... if you choose foodservice as a career - which there is NOTHING wrong with - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and do NOT bathe in strong smelling perfumes and colognes.  The stench greatly affects the flavor of the food your PAYING CUSTOMERS eat (yes, the ones who also tip you).  Who knows - the food may have been the best food ever served to mankind... I wouldn't know because all I could taste was the stench of that sickly sweet perfume.    Not going back.

For my birthday dinner, I wanted something I hadn't had in a long time - added bonus that it was a new experience for my husband.  After dropping our daughter off at Grandma's House for the night, my hubby and I scooted over to Blue Adobe.   The place isn't much to look at - this section of Mesa has been hit hard by economic hard times and residents that don't give a rip about their surroundings.  It's a quaint little building and lo and behold, a barbecue joint is next door - not sure when that happened.  We walked in and were immediately greeted.  The woman even guessed who I was, based on a phone call I made there and hour and a half earlier.  It was a crowded Friday night and almost every table was filled except one in the middle - ours!  Our waitress was immediately at our table asking for our drink order.  My husband asked for her recommendation and she had several.  for me - it was hard to decide between one of the pasta dishes; the chimi or the Carne Adovada.  In the end, the adovada won!!    It didn't take us long to notice the deftness of the staff.  Almost IMMEDIATELY after a party left a table, a young man swooped in and prepared the table for the next diners - maybe 30 seconds flat!  He was also quick to fill our glasses of water and remove unwanted dishes off our table.    The salsa was a nice break from traditional Mexican salsa.  It had a deeper, richer flavor to it - smokey and complex.  The chips were perfectly seasoned - not to salty, not too bland.  Nice thickness on them as well (I can't stand thick chips!!)  When our entrees arrived, we were ready to face the fire!  My husband's Taos Combo had a pork tamale, a tenderloin relleno and a shrimp enchilada.  It was a great way to be introduced to New Mexican cuisine.  I had a bite of the enchilada and the relleno - the tenderloin in the relleno had a deep smokey flavor.  My Carne Adovada was incredible! Such complexity!  The heat snuck up on you and surrounded you - not a bad heat like eating a habanero, but a rich heat that built up over time.  The meat was tender and flaky and smothered in that deep red/brown sauce.  The rice had that same distinct New Mexican richness to it that traditional "Mexican" or "Tex Mex" doesn't offer.  My only complaint was the lack of a vegetable.  I would have preferred something like a succotash or even just some diced tomatoes instead of beans.  We ended up asking for some sour cream to tame the heat a little and what ended up happening (for me anyway) was that the sour cream accentuated the deep complexity of the spices - I tasted more of the preparation behind the adovada.    My husband ordered a "birthday treat" for us - the pumpkin brulee, which is only available during November (yay for having a November birthday!).  We wondered if we were going to be able to eat it - what with feeling like we just ran into a wall with all that good adovada and tamales in our bellies, but we were both surprised how much we powered through that brulee.  It was perfectly done - PERFECT!!  The pumpkin flavor was obvious without being overbearing.  It was surprisingly light.

Walking up to this place, you'd think there was no other place in town for breakfast.  We had very high hopes just based on the amount of people waiting to be seated.  Unfortunately, our hopes were dashed after eating.    First of all, as far as service is concerned, they rate high.  This place was C-ROW-DED! My husband and I and our toddler were seated outside on the patio about 20 minutes after we arrived.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  As far as the food is concerned?  Blah!!  I ordered the California Benedict.  The English muffin was toasted which was nice, but everything else was bland as can be.  I asked the waitress to request my eggs poached "medium".  One thing having a kid will do to you is change some food habits.  I haven't been able to eat runny eggs since I was pregnant.  "Sure" she said with a happy smile.  One egg was completely undercooked, the other was completely OVERcooked... no happy medium.  The hollandaise must have been from a packet.  It had no flavor whatsoever.  Same with the potatoes.  Bland.  Boring.  Yuck.    My husband had the chicken friend steak.  Like the hollandaise, he was certain the gravy was straight out of a packet.    It's so rare that we get out for breakfast, let alone a benedict or chicken fried steak sort of breakfast.  I misjudged the long lines outside and the relatively steep prices.  I don't mind paying $25 for breakfast for two if it's worth it.  But U.S. Egg was definately not worth it.

First time ordering from Clockwork. I didn't even know they were there!  I'm a foodie - there's no question about it... and this girl likes her pizza. What I don't like is the crap that's served by the plethora of chain places. I absolutely won't dignify those places with business.   When it comes to "the best" pizza, yeah, Chris Bianco, Spinatos, La Piazza etc. are all "best", but they don't make sense most nights of the week. Enter Clockwork. I will definitely order from them again.  The lady who answered the phone was friendly and helpful. She said the pizza would be there "as soon as possible..." and we got it almost exactly an hour later, which was a little disappointing.   What was delivered was a very tasty, well put together pizza. We had the "Godfather". Peppers, onions, mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni.   It was a great pizza at a great price... again, we will definitely be ordering from Clockwork again.

Garcia's is neither Mexican, nor Food.  Anyone wanting authentic Mexican needs to stay away from this and other "chain" restaurants.  Here in AZ, you can pretty much throw a rock in any direction and hit a good, family owned and operated Mexican place that's TO DIE FOR.  Stay away from the chains.  A hint?  If it's got orange cheese all over the place, IT AIN'T REAL MEXICAN.

The food is quite good!  The flavors of the taco/burrito fillings is wonderful.  I like that they have both lettuce AND cabbage at the salsa bar so you can fill your taco how you like.  The tortillas are some of the best I've tasted.  The salsa is hit and miss.  There's a nice selection, but sometimes they can be either bland or way too hot.  The guacamole is AWESOME.    I've read some of the other reviews that say this place "isn't real Mexican".... uh, it's a heck of a lot closer to Mexican than most of the places in town.  Not sure what these other folks consider "real" Mexican.  My only complaint is that I have to pay for chips and salsa.

It's always nice when you look at a restaurants reviews on here and see the owners/managers ACTUALLY responding.  Seems Lush Burger doesn't care - I don't see anything in the way of management response.  That should have been my 2nd clue (the first being the overwhelming number of UNDERwhelming reviews.  Oh well....  The place has a groovy, contemporary appeal to it and after reading the menu online, I felt it was worth a try.  They are VERY close to our office so "the girls" and I decided to bop down there in my mommymobile and burger down.    First of all - ANY place open for lunch had darned well better know their business lunch crowd: here's a hint, Lush Burger.... if people walk in wearing ID badges, THEY'RE BUSINESS LUNCHERS.  While most of us aren't on a "1 hour only for lunch" type of schedule, most of us have OBLIGATIONS such as meetings or conference calls.  On the other hand, if a couple of svelte senior women in their tennis gear walk in, chances are, they're in no rush.    We sat and waited several minutes before our menus were even delivered.  That should have been a hint for us to bolt and go to AJ's for a sandwich.  FINALLY menus were delivered and our drink orders were taken.  As far as the iced tea is concerned - skip it - it's a horrible mix.  Blech.    When we FINALLY got our burgers which were touted as "cooked medium", I was saddened to see that mine was a very, very well done.  I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for a (fricken) burger, so I just ate it.  The bun was wonderful, the butter lettuce, fantastic.  I couldn't taste the "special sauce" - I think it was sucked into the dryness of my burger.  The meat had no flavor - not even that good "beefy" flavor that Smashburger is soo good at.  It was flat out WAY too overcooked.    The chips were decent and a nice change from what you normally get at a burger place.  I usually pass on french fries @ burger places because they take up too much room in my stomach, which means less room for burger.  The home-made chips were enough of a potato flavor to highlight the meal, but not too much so as to render you completely full about halfway through your meal.  Won't be back.  Sorry Lush - I wanted to like you - you're so close to my office.  But yuk.

His prices can't be beat.  He was punctual and helpful - even when he was on vacation he sent us a quote on TWO systems.  We're very happy with our new A/C.  Highly recommend.

OUTSTANDING burger.  Their fries are excellent as well.  I also like the fact that they do not use iceberg lettuce.

First time there for breakfast this morning.  My husband is a real "biscuits and gravy" kinda guy so I figured a place called "Biscuits" would be right up his alley.  Me - I'm more of a benedict girl.    The place was very welcoming and it was obvious that they loved kids.  There's a small play area in the corner of the waiting area which my daughter loved.  They also had bails of hay (covered in pretty quilts) for kids to climb on.  We were promptly seated and our order was taken.  They served us coffee and this was the best coffee I've had outside of my house.  A strong brew with lots of flavor and no bitterness.    On to the meals.    My husband had his all-time favorite, chicken fried steak.  Like a good man, he shared a bit with me.  BEST CFS I've had - as good as TexAz Grill.  My husband always orders gravy on the side - ensures the CFS is crispy.  The steak was very nicely cooked and coated.  The coating had that perfectly peppery taste to it.  The biscuits were soft, fluffy and light - NOT dry or heavy at all.  The gravy was smooth and silky with a very nice full flavor to it.  Gravy is usually heavy, which is why it's not a favorite breakfast choice for me, but this gravy was light and full of flavor with nice chunks of sausage in it.  I just had bacon and eggs... and I would love to know where these folks get their bacon from, because I haven't had bacon that good ever.  The people who worked there were very friendly.  It's a well-run place that we will definitely return to!

Went back for a 2nd go-round.  This time I got the B&G also.  It really was fantastic.  The gravy was about as perfect as can be with one exception - there weren't any sausage chunks.    I opted for the country potatoes which I did not like at all - they were WAY too onion-y.  The hash browns are great.  This place gets high marks for the service - the owners are very friendly and welcoming.

What a great place! The Osso Bucco was incredible - very tender, no knife needed. The spaetzle was a perfect pairing for it as well (as a side note, Four Peaks Peach Ale paired well with this). My husband and his colleague had the nightly special - a flatiron ribeye that was perfectly medium, served with a remarkable ratatouille. We foolishly neglected to get dessert... our mistake. We'll definitely be back to Beckett's.  The service was friendly, the place was unpretentious and welcoming... like being at a friend's house. Hip environment and just what the neighborhood needed. I had a hard time deciding between several entrees.   The food is heavy - well seasoned, well prepared and masterfully presented.

Had lunch there this past Friday.  The service was slow for how few people were there, but I dug the atmosphere and LOVED the music on the jukebox.  Now, for the food.  I had the pulled pork w/ cole slaw and a side of mac n cheese.  The first thing I do at ANY bbq place is try and taste the meat all by itself, which wasn't hard to do at Earl's - because they didn't drown the sandwich in bbq sauce like a lot of places do.  What I tasted was some of the best flavored pork since I went to Sonny Bryan's in Texas. I'm sure there was some salt and pepper rubbed on the hunk o' pork before they stuck it in the smoker which is really all good bbq needs.  Any REAL bbq afficionado knows that the more crap (i.e. seasonings) on a piece of meat, the more the bbq-er is tryin' to hide.  So I didn't taste brown sugar, garlic, thyme, paprika, chili powder, lemon, apple, and God knows what else, but I DID taste well smoked pork.  As God intended.  Thank you, Big Earl's!  I tried both the regular and the sweet n spicy sauces which were disappointing.  They just bored me.    The slaw was crisp and lightly dressed (in other words, it wasn't goopy).  The mac n cheese was simple and perfect.

I realize "this is fast food" and not fine dining.. I get it...but I feel my complaints are legit. Over the years, El Pollo Loco has earned my respect as a well run fast food place. Great food at a great value. I've even utilized their catering services throughout the years with great success. There's a huge difference between having a crappy meal and having a crappy meal at a place you know is not a bad place.  Last week, my mother and I stopped at this location to bring home some dinner. First of all, the young man at the cash register was a mumble mouth. My poor hearing aid-clad mother thought she had to get new devices... I assured her it wasn't her ears... the dude talked like he had a mouth of marbles. We had to ask him to repeat himself EVERY...SINGLE...TIME...HE...TALKED... Furthermore, he clearly did not understand the menu offerings... we had to explain ourselves repeatedly and finally found something and pointed it to him so he understood what we wanted to order. FRUSTRATING.  The food... the chicken we were given was way - way - WAY overcooked. We were watching the "cook" put it in the box and we were incredulous that someone would deem it edible. It was BLACK. While we were waiting for our food, two other people came up to the counter with burnt chicken. It took forever for mumble mouth and his buddy to realize that they had a pile of people building up with burned chicken. When we showed him the food, he was unconvinced that the food was even bad. I wouldn't have fed it to my dog! He tried to strike some deal - 2 new pieces for 3 burnt ones. We flat out told him "No, we think we should get all new chicken". He started throwing attitude our way. My mother, fresh off of a 3.5 hour flight almost went postal on this stupid kid. Meanwhile Senor Grillmaster was flapping his jaws behind the grill, burning more chicken.   I've been to several El Pollo Locos around the valley and almost always get great food, great service and great prices. This location will not get our business again.

We enjoyed our dinner here very much. Yes, the decor is dark but modern, and we found it to be quite romantic for our purposes. I can see how a large group would not appreciate this though.  The waitress was knowledgable and excited about the food offering and my husband, never one to make a choice on his own, received an earful when he asked for a recommendation. Our waitress listed about 4 or 5 of her favorites! Needless to say, it didn't make his decision any easier, but I like hearing and seeing the servers get excited about where they work.  We ordered chips & guacamole and it was fantastic. You could taste the smokiness of the roasted jalapenos and the covering of grated cotija cheese was a great touch (and one I will steal the next time I make guac).   We also ordered a carafe of Sangria which I absolutely loved. Some of the best I've tasted.   My husband ordered the pork belly and I ordered the prawns. both meals were superbly done, not too large, but definately enough to fill us up.  Embarassingly, my husband informed them that it was my birthday, so we were treated to a chocolate explosion on a plate which was absolutely amazing.

Just tried today for lunch. I'm a pizza purist, so all of those fly-by-night, fad pizza joints with their outlandish toppings and crazy flavors don't impress me. I want a good crust, balanced sauce and quality toppings - period!  Crust - This makes or breaks a pie, whether your a Chicago deep-dish lover, or Chicago thin-crust/square cut type of person or a New York afficionado. If the crust is wrong, it doesn't matter what's on the pie, you ain't gonna score any points. That being said, Giant Rustic reminds me of the street-side pizza joints in New York that are a dime a dozen, with several generations of families working in the back slinging out honest-to-God great pizza - no frills. It came out of the oven with a great crispness all the way through. The edges were big and puffy with a great crunch.   Sauce - Perfect balance between sweet and savory. Not too heavy, not too light.   Pepperoni - thin thin THIN sliced and mildly flavored. Big win. My other piece (I got the lunch special, 2 slices and a drink) was a simple cheese which was great in its simplicity. The cheese had a great melted texture that was music to my mouth.  All in all, it's a win.  Service was great, friendly, fast - everything you want for a business lunch spot. Loved the soft Italian guitar music playing in the background - apropos for the mob book I'm reading...   The ONLY reason I docked them a star is how small the place is. There is counter space for MAYBE 5 people and a few tables outside. This place has the potential to be big things but they are totally out of space for it... unless one of the places on either side of them closes down.

We've always had GREAT service here - the wait staff is extremely child-friendly. Our waiter the other night brought our daugter a cup of water with a pink umbrella in it and told her he made it special for her because she's a special little girl. Unbelievable! You just don't get that anymore in restaurants!  Anyway - we were seated immediately upon entering on a Friday night. Surprised the place wasn't more packed than it was... we've been here before and love their food.   Salsa was immediately brought to our table and we're big fans of their salsa. Simple, flavorful and authentic.   I almost always order the small Norteno Torta - I adore the flavor and texture combinations and their bolillo bread is so soft and fluffy and flavorful!  My little girl ordered the hamburguesa (or as she calls it, a hang-gubber). We each managed to sneak a bite of it - and it's a mighty fine burger indeed! I may one day try just a burger!  My husband asked our water to "go authentic" on him - he left his choice up to the waiter and our waiter did NOT disappoint. A plate full of seasoned beef, some nopales, rice and beans and fresh tortillas. He loved it.   Big fans - we'll go back again and again!

Sadly, the Ferrari of Minivans is no longer... she met an untimely demise a few weeks ago.   The whole famdam, including our St. Louis branch, decided tacos were in order before the St. Louians headed back home. We bandied about this place and that.. until mum (MUM!!!) suggested this gastropub. Natch, I've heard of it... just hadn't had time to venture down there from SoTem yet.  I'm firstly grateful that the historic old church building was saved from the wrecking ball and that Taco Guild left some of it's rustic charm in place. Who in their right mind would demolish stained glass?  I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a great place to bring kids, but we had a 5 y/o and a 2 y/o. The restaurant was more than accommodating, but the atmosphere is more grown up in nature. Not holding that against them.  Some of the famdam got the 1893 Margs (happy hour!) and said they were stupendous. We stuck with water... so we'll take their word.  The salsas... they give you FOUR... a big bowl of their house salsa that's on the mild side, with a slight kick and three small bowls of various other heat levels. I enjoyed every single salsa they had. Each had their own unique depth, flavor profile and heat level.  Our table also got an order of guac. It was a little "too chunky" and had to be hacked a little more, but the flavor was perfect; nothing missing.  Now for the tacos... they do not disappoint. I'm already plotting my next visit so I can try a couple of other meats. Several at our table got the coffee braised beef. It had a smooth, complex flavor to it - just like your favorite cup of coffee (not of the Char-Sucks variety). You can't "taste" coffee, but you know there's a smoothness to the flavor of the meat. A few of us also had the Adovada and that was incredibly flavorful and rich. There is no question every single taco filling is lovingly and artistically created by the chefs.   My husband also got the Cherry Steak which was a religious experience in and of itself. I could have rubbed it on my body and died happy. My sister got the Peking Duck and it was a shockingly pleasing flavor adventure. My brother had a shrimp taco and - while he said it was a little light on actual shrimp, the flavor of it was spot on.   These tacos are amazing. Again - I can't wait to go back and try some more.

The truck is at our office today... a new thing we're doing at work (yay!)  Let me just tell you - these aint the dogs your mamma used to make. First of all, the quality of the dog itself is obvious. No "necks and feet" in this dog. You can tell it's made of quality cuts of meat.   I decided to "go big" so I got the "Maine Squeeze" on a pretzel bun with the garlic romano chips. Oh Em Gee....  Pretzel bun was nice and soft and slightly grilled - there was a tiny bit of a crunch to it which was fantastic. Very tasty and the right way to do a fancy dog.  The mac and cheese was delish... done right, as in roux, slow cooked, good cheeses, etc. I couldn't taste (or see) lobster, so I'm not sure about that part.   The chips - super awesome. Done right, that's for sure. I wish more restaurants/trucks knew how very easy it was to make homemade potato chips.   Some people cry about the prices, but believe you me, this isn't your typical boiled questionable weenie in a potato bun with ketchup and mustard... this is gourmet all the way and worth the $10 for a dog and chips. I'm FULLLLLLL. An Oscar Mayer doesn't get me full... this big dog did.   Glad they came by - I'll be looking for them again.

Tried this place for the first time today.   It's in a rather obscure place - inside an office building in kind of an out-of-the-way place behind Scottsdale Airpark, but it's obvious they have quite the following.  The place is small and cute - very quaint. There is a wide variety of their baked goods on display to tempt your eyes.  My colleagues and I all got the same sandwich: the Chicken Salad on Croissant. It was fantastic! The chicken salad had nuts and cranberries in it and a little heat in the background. The apple slaw was very delicious. My colleagues both had the cowboy beans and both loved them.  We each got a sweet treat to enjoy later... some of those baked goods on display. I really enjoyed my brownie.  It's a small place that will be very hard to get into in short order. So get there while you can!  The food was a little expensive, but I'm perfectly OK paying a little more for great food that was lovingly prepared by a locally owned business. The money I paid will stay in the community rather than some corporate fatcat back east. We will definitely be back!

Their truck stopped by work today; being that I had no car, I was limited... and kinda scared after reading some reviews.   Small????? Whoever calls these pizzas "too small" need to have their heads examined. I couldn't finish it and I'm a big girl with a big appetite.   The crust... which any pizza aficionado will tell you will make or break a pizza - was absolutely spot on. For being made in a truck, I was shocked by this. It was thin with that cracker flavor/feeling to it. Served piping hot.   The cheese was very obviously hand grated and not purchased grated. When you buy the bags of grated mozz, it has cellulose, potato starch and Natamycin which prevent it from melting. The cheese on this pizza was ooey, gooey and melty-licious! Great texture! I did feel that the pie I got lacked a freshness zing (like fresh tomatoes, some arugula or even olives), the chicken was nicely cooked/seasoned and the red onions gave it a sweetness. The pesto was a little on the bland side; but I'm the type who makes mine from scratch with organic ingredients so my pesto bar is naturally high to begin with.   While I had to add a little fresh-ground pepper to my pie, I do that with any pie.   Good show, guys. You have a fan at FMIC!
