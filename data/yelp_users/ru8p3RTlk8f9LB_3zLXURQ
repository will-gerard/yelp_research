I've always loved this theater. Big enough and still be intimate. There are no bad seats on the main floor. I love the feeling of grandeur once you enter this theater. I always feel like whatever I'm watching is going to be good otherwise it wouldn't be performing at the Herberger. I also love their location, 5 min walking distance from the Arizona Center so we can have a great dinner before a show at a nice restaurant without having to stress out about driving and the need to find parking twice!

I can't believe I haven't written a review for the Phoenix Symphony since I've been a regular here for the last 3 years! I've brought my son here to see the Nutcracker performed by the AZ Ballet since he was two. And we're season subscribers to the Phoenix Symphony Family Series for the last two years.  We have tickets in the Orchestra section so my son who is 5 can see all the musicians up close and personal to keep his attention.  I love how they add a little kid friendly entertainment and/or performance to each concert to make it fun for the little ones. Also love the family activities an hour prior to start of concert.  While there is no dress code, it's always nice to use this occasion to dress up my son a little so he knows we are going to some place special.

I love the AZ Science Center. My son and I have been coming here for the last 7 years and we love it each time we are here. The center has their permanent exhibits but they always have something new and fun thru out the year so regardless of how many times you go, there is always something new for your little one to explore. It's easy to spend a whole day there starting early in the morning. It's impossible to condense 7 years of experience into one short review except to write that this place is worth coming to, for locals and out of towners alike if I've been able to bring my son here for 7 years and have been consistently happy with the center. And I look forward to bringing him here for many more years to come!

Soooo . . . As my child gets bigger and he goes from the size of a football to a boy who needs to jump into my arm for me to be able to lift and hold him, it crossed my mind perhaps he was now too old for the AZ Science Center.   Glad to share that this is sooooo not the case!  My son is 7 now and just this week, I've taken him twice to partake in Snow Week where for the past week, they've special activities planned for each day.   The two days I was there, there were tons of special activities on the daily schedule and these special activities were so well planned, my son and his friend enjoyed participating in them so much that both days, we spent minimal time on their permanent exhibits!!!!  Whoever was in charge (maybe it was a team?) of Snow Week did an absolutely thumbs up (both thumbs up in fact) fanta-excellent job!  Both my son and his friend enjoyed the science experiments on the first floor theater, the making of mini bobsleds out of giant spuds (Idaho potatoes) then racing the, down mini sled tracks, mini ice hockey (ice frozen on cookie sheet then min ice hickey sticks made from Popsicle sticks and pucks made from penny covered with electrical tape)- genius. My son and his friend played for almost an hour with this simple contraption!  Scented balloons were a big hit, as was making the gingerbread house.   Aside from the special activities, my favorite section (see, and I'm a grown up- I think) LOL. Big kid at heart, that's me- is on the 2nd level where the kids can hands on learn about mechanical properties. All of us (including me) can spend hours there going from one hands on exhibit to the next.   The permanent exhibits are an added bonus. Why do I say that?  Because they usually have a special exhibit or special activities planned that you can spend your whole day doing those!  I'm really looking forward to see what's next after Snow Week and now that I know how much fun Snow Week is from going this year, next year I will be taking my son for sure and plan on being there from open to close!!!!

We attended the Las Noches de las Luminarias again this year and since I've been away out of the country for the last four months, upon returning I can appreciate more the beauty and serenity of this particular desert botanical garden.  The night was perfect, not too cold, not too hot and there were 12 different musician stations playing throughout the garden.   Amazing part was when you are at each station, you felt like it was its own private concert, with no interference from the other musician stations. A lovely evening of great food and company spent in a lovely atmosphere!

I kept reading about the chicken fried steak from here in various papers so of course, I had to come in here and order their infamous chicken fried steak.  All the reviews were true to their word. The chicken fried steak is gigantic in portion smothered in country gravy served with mashed potatoes and corn. And of course, buttery biscuit.  Well, I don't remember much after ingesting a quarter of the chicken fried steak cause my brain went into a food coma.  I do remember doggie bagging still enough food for 3 meals, staggering to my car and driving home.  Where I hope, once home, I took a nap.

My niece came in from LA for the day and since she was staying at the Ritz, I suggested the MercBar.  Always liked this place and still do.  My niece and I had some great conversations over some dirty mules.    She's a drink aficionado and apparently, the MercBar made the dirty mule to her liking . . .

I've always loved Hava Java- if I lived closer, I would prob be there daily and develop an addiction.  When I heard they had recently undated their interior I thought I would drive over and check it out.  Upon entering, it was caffeinetastic to see the place packed. Each table was filled with someone typing away on their electronic device or chatting away. I loved the sense of coziness- like you could sit there all day if you should choose.  Being summer, I decided to order an iced coffee and it was delish!  Just the right amount of flavor and just what I needed! I also loved the new bar area. Modernized yet still matching the existing decor. I also like how clean everything felt.  That's important for me anywhere I go.  I think Hava Java has been around a long time. I can see why- and I see them being around for many years to come.  Can't go wrong coming here for a cup of Jo. And if you check in on Yelp, it's 10% off your bill!

This is my second year being a member of the Phoenix Film Society and my second year attending the Phoenix Fim Festival.  I go with a flex pass so each year I see 4 films. This year, I almost didn't attend because I had a ski accident and was told by the doctor to stay home and rest with my leg elevated before my surgery. Well, I got bored and decided to do double headers on the last 2 nights before the festival ended. I was able to call ahead and reserve my tkts ahead of time which was a big time saver.  On my way to the theater, a volunteer saw me walking with crutches and walked with me, held the door open for me and even sat with me through the movie to make sure I would be okay. In betwn the movie, a volunteer got a chair for me to sit on so I didn't have to walk far while they cleaned the theater in btwn the movies. The second night was the same.  The volunteers were so nice.  One even adjusted my crutches for me because they were not fitted correctly.  In addition, I sat next to a couple who really empathized with my situation~ the husband had just got done with surgery and rehab.  They told me they would bring me his wheelchair and walker for me to use during recovery and sure enough, the hubby brought it by the other day! Here I am glowing about the volunteers at the festival and haven't talked about the festival itself. . . . this festival is a year long planning event completely run by volunteers . . . for this to happen, the festival itself has to have a lot of heart,  And any event that has a lot of heart, has to be good.   I love movies, I love the Phoenix Film Society, and I love the Phoenix Film Festival.   I ask that anyone who has attended the festival and had a bad experience to become a volunteer or a member and once you get to know the directors (volunteers) and what it takes to pull a festival of this scale together, then you can better appreciate the existence of this wonderful festival.

Okay, I admit it, I have an Apple addiction. Having an Apple a day is just not enough for me. I like to have several Apples a day, every day. Yes, I like to go to the store and just hang out, try out their new products and programs and I can't wait to enroll myself and my son in their abundant free workshops.  Gosh, I am unabashingly gushing about this place. Apparently I'm not the only one as the place is always busy, from morning to night. Seriously, I'm not kidding. If you need to talk to a genius at the genius bar, make sure you book an appointment online first and either bring a book or some work with you or be prepared to use one of their many available Apples that are for your use to cruise the Internet because these guys are never on time with their appointments.  Instead of getting upset, be understanding. Because well, these appointments are hard to time when the client is trying to understand something. I mean, what's worse to have th genius tell you he has to go to the next appointment to keep his schedule or to work with you until your problem is resolved?? Just enjoy the vibe of the place while waiting!

T. Cook's and I have a long history but T. doesn't know it.  The first time I met him was over ten years ago when I was just making it in this town.  I had reached my goal for my office and in celebration, I took some of my friends and biggest cheerleaders there to celebrate.  T's food went right to my g-spot and I had an orgasmic reaction right there at the table.   I saved T for special occassions.  The next time I went was again for some celebratory occassion with some friends and once again, T's food went right to my g-spot and I had another orgasmic reaction. The third time, I've been spoiled so I was secretly rubbing my legs together under their pristine table linen in anticipation and didn't care who saw me as I licked every delectable morsel off of my plate and fingers, groaning with pleasure. With gloating praise of T., I got a group of friends together for a private dining experience at the Delano Room (min. $500 spending) for a holiday dinner this past Christmas.  When making the reservation, the lady was a bit snubby which I can accept when I am anticipating another orgasmic experience.   We gather for a evening of fine dining . . . except this time, T. had performance anxiety and failed me.  First the waitress looked like she was overworked and coming into the Delano Room was an inconvinence to her because she has just way too many tables outside that were more important to her.  When my dish came, it had been under the heat lamp for so long that it was completely shriveled that I could not tell what dish I had ordered.  I gave her one look and without a word, she took the dish back and asked me if I would like to order another dish.  Where my g-spot was left high and dry was when we got the bill, the antipasto dish that the waitress had recommended we ordered as a 3-person portion was a whopping $45 per plate.  She had said that "some" additional amount would be added for a larger portion- she neglected to clarify that it would be a whopping 3x's the amount.  And we had 2 plates of those . . . $90 for 2 antipasto plates??   So what was supposed to be my most savory experience with T. was completely anticlimatic and totally blemished my memory of him. I know T's popular so he'll have many suitors- just not this one.

As you can see, the last review was written in 2007 so this store has been around a long time!  Count 7 years and going strong!  It's an Arcadia regular. The selection they carry are upscale and most importantly, many are one of a kind for that friend or family member who has everything.  I love to go into the store and browse and be serviced by the incredible ladies who work there. Just go in, tell them your needs and within 10 minutes they will have your outfit, shoes, and accessories picked out for you. They are that good and that quick.  The clothes they carry are for all body types so you just need to browse a little for something for you to fall in love with.  The best part of the store is the sign that says, your husband called and he says you can buy whatever you want!   When you get home, laden with multiple bags full of beauty and glamour, just tell your husband you were just following his directions. ;) But really, he couldn't get upset at you regardless cause when you put on the outfits you bought for him to see, he'll be so bedazzled by your beauty that the only thing he will be able to think about is which magnificent restaurant to take you out to dinner!!!

I never thought I would be the kind of person to work out in a gym.  I grew up thinking gyms are only where the meat heads go- the grinds of working on weights just seemed boring and pointless to me.  When I turned 30, someone gave me a lifetime membership to Bally's as a gift so I started going because, well, it was a gift and already paid for.  I started seeing some really hot bodies on women in their forties and I started to change my mind.    But I was not faithful to Bally's because I just didn't like the atmosphere of the place.  Once I started to appreciate the value of a work out, I started gym shopping.  Tried LA Fitness, 24 Hour Fitness, Lifetime Fitness and none of them kept my attention or loyalty.  Finally, I ventured into the Village Racquet & Health Club- mainly, again, because friends would have me either workout or play tennis with them at the Camelback Village.  This is where I've fallen in love.  I love the facility, the classes, the equipment, and I don't know who I love more- the people who work there or the members.  There's some kind of magic to the Village clubs- aptly named the Village because somehow, the place, the staff, the members becomes . . . your friends!  The Village clubs truly is a lifestyle, not a place where you go to sweat off a few pounds then leave for someplace better.  I've worked out in all three locations at one time or another.  Each location I've discovered has its own flavor- Camelback for tennis, classes held early in the morning and in the evening for the working professional, the BAR- Gainey for the triathletes, classes held early in the morning and in the evening, again for the working professional- and DC Ranch for families with a great pool area and classes scheduled more for the stay at home moms.  I love them all- I love going into the beautiful facility, getting greeted by a warm smile from the staff, seeing gorgeous people who are committed to living a healthy lifestyle.  I love how clean the locker rooms always are and there are towels and water just where you need them.  I love the abundance of classes- spin, yoga, pilates and the ever addicting zumba.  I love them all.  Village- I stay loyal and true to you!

I've been living here since 1997 and during these years, I've tried the Bally's, Lifetime, 24hr, LA Fitness, JCC, La Camarilla, been guests at Phoenix CC, AZ Country Club, PV Country Club and my favorite still comes back to the Villages and I'm glad to be at this Camelback location.   After taking a break from tennis, I'm back to playing and I'm loving it here. There is a new tennis director Will Whites and it's a very active tennis community. Since joining, I've met a lot of players from going to the cardio tennis MW 6-7am & Sat 7-8am, the drop in tennis on Fri mid day. The mixed doubles league in the evening is a social scene. Players stay after the matches and get together for drinks & food after- often staying until the bar area closes.   It's no secret I LOVE all the Villages for their friendly staff, immaculate fitness center, beautiful interior, extensive offering of yoga, Pilates & fitness classes & wonderful, heart thumping spin classes. There is racquetball, basketball, kid's summer camps. Even training for triathlons!!!  Not to mention their great swimming pool areas which recently they've added tables & chairs for a more relaxing atmosphere. I also LOVE their dressing rooms, jacuzzi & steam rooms.   I wish they would add an outdoor jacuzzi so families could be in the jacuzzis together- a minor item compared everything else they offer.   It's not surprising after awhile, you make friends with the other members and it's not surprising to hear that there are multi generational family members too.    If you read this review & decide to join, mention my name  Su-shien Cho since all member referrals receive one free month of dues.   Just join & thank me later- you'll love it here!!!

Love this place- there's a vibe here that's just fun and vibrant.  And I am addicted to their bruschetta and their antipasto plate.   How good is this place?  Some days, I get physical cravings for their bruschetta and I just have to have some- or when I am having a bad day- you guessed it- having some of their bruschettas makes me feel better. I've had bruschetta at other restaurants but none compared to the ones from Postino.  I think when they spread that topping on those yummy bread, they are thinking good cheer and loving thoughts- how else can you explain the addictive qualities of toppings placed on top of pieces of bread? Love this place and I' would go back again and again.

I've been eating here for over ten years.  Each time I'm in the area around lunch time, I try to eat here. Over the years, the interior has stayed clean and fresh looking. The most important part being that the taste of the food has stayed consistent and delicious!  The menu has a good variety. Both the lunch and dinner prices are reasonably priced.  It's nice that for over ten years, I can count on having good service and a good meal here!

Each time I've come to this discount tire location, I've always been greeted and serviced promptly. This motto of great service is what makes Discount Tires so successful. And their unflappable enthusiasm to check your tire pressure for you and patch any leaks free of charge. Just amazing!!! Once, for some weird reason, my tires were either low or leaking- it was very close to closing time, I called them and they actually waited for me to show up, took care of my issues before they closed shop.  Talk about building costumer loyalty! Two Yelp thumbs up!

Honestly, if you tried to tell me that I would be writing a positive review for Chuck E Cheese 3 years ago, I would have told you- you were nuts! Because 3 years ago, I didn't even know what this place was.  Then after having my son, I avoided Chuck E. Cheese like the plague because the place just seemed noisy and ANNOYING to me. Well, here I am 3 years later giving Chuck E. Cheese 5 stars- why?  Because my 3 year old absolutely LOVES this place.   Don't ask me how because I've never mentioned Chuck E. Cheese to him but at 2 1/2 when we drove past a Chuck E. Cheese, he could call out the place by name and wanted to go there. FINALLY, I could not avoid the place any longer after we were invited there for a birthday party and my son was so excited to go there.  Once there, my son was in heaven!! The noise level on a busy Saturday morning still drives me crazy but I've since gone with my son and friends on a weekday morning when it's not so busy and I have to admit, it is a very safe environment with fun games that will entertain your child for hours. And definitely get on their email list for their great coupons and specials because if you are like me (and I never thought I would be doing it), you will end up buying tokens by the bucket load! So Chuck E. Cheese, never thought I would ever be doing this but here's a 5 star posting for you!

I took my son here for his first hair cut.  Andrew's has had a few hair stylists from this place and each time we've diverted from Theresa, both my son and I have not been happy.  ALWAYS ask for Theresa, she is warm, friendly, makes your kid feel comfortable and she gives great hair cuts QUICKLY which is muy importanto when you have a little one squirming in the chair. It helps that they have videos and video games to entertain the kids and if your child is a toddler, they have cool car seats for them to seat in. Save some time by calling ahead and booking an appointment.  I usually book my son's appointment ahead of time (asking for Theresa OF COURSE- she's works 2 days a week now) then it's hassle free.  You can be in and out of there with a haircut for your child in about 30 mins and you all know, that's priceless!!!

Sometimes you just have a pair of shoes that you love so much, you keep getting the soles or heels replaced.   I have a pair of classic Joan & David black pump, suede that is so comfortable that I think I've had them for over 15 years and I just keep replacing the heels. This time I took them to Paradise Family Shoe Repair.  The place is on the SE corner of Tatum & Thunderbird.  Place is super clean and the guy very friendly. He charged me $15 to replace the heels and an additional $25 to add some super tough rubber sole to the leather soles of my heels.  When I got the shoes back, I was impressed by how well replaced the heels were and I am very happy with the super tough rubber soles that were still comfortable because I know my classic black pumps will probably now last me another 20 years.   The best part?  My black suede was looking a little worn and he sprayed a product call Suede Renew on the pumps (at no additional charge!!) and my shoes came back looking brand new. He told me I would be impressed by the work he does with my shoes and I have to write that he's right!

I've been coming here for years. Think at least 4. And I have to say I think a lot of people have complained enough about their hard sell tactics of trying to get you to upgrade that I've noticed recently the staff is much more easy going. Which for me as a costumer, makes my experience more enjoyable. I've gotten their express wash to their extreme wash and I have to say overall I've been happy with the cleanliness of my car and how fast it gets washed. Even if I have to wait I don't mind as they have free wifi so I generally take the time to check my emails or watch a movie. The guys and gals working there are always friendly and helpful. The only I don't like is years ago when I would get a car wash here wiping down the interior upholstery was part of the wash but now it's an extra charge so my exterior is clean, it's vacuumed but my seats are dirty and need to be wiped down and cleaned!  I wish they had a package where they offer to clean the upholstery at a reasonable price. As I go there at least once a month, if they offered a service like that, my car would be like new and I would be a completely satisfied costumer!

Yup, an update so soon. At this point, I don't know who has trained who. It seems like they don't try to sell upgrades as hard to me which I like and after coming here for years I know how clean my car will be.   This time, I actually cleaned the interior of the car myself before coming to get it washed. What little that still needed to be vacuumed, I told the guy and yup, sure enough, when I picked up the car, the area that needed to be vacuumed . . . still needed to be vacuumed. Lol.   And I still come here to get my car washed. What can I write- I think at this point I think Cobblestone is like a comfy pair of shoes to me. Lol.

The first time I walked into Paradise Nails, I was looking for a quick mani/pedi close to my house and when I first walked in, I was impressed by how spacious and clean the place looked.   The price for a mani/pedi is reasonable- $31 + tip- before I started, I mentioned a coupon that I had but forgot to bring for a mani/pedi for $26 and the owner happened to be working that day and he honored that price even though I didn't have the coupon in hand- I thought that was very cool. The staff that works there really know how to take care of you- I walked out of there an hour later feeling de-stressed and relaxed.  And I am not sure what kind of top coat they use but my Opi nail polish stayed on my finger nails and toe nails for over 3 weeks.  No chips! I've been back there for a second visit and got the same great service again.  Right now as I am typing, I am one happy camper since my finger nails and toe nails look great and I know that the mani/pedi will last for awhile! Definitely a place worth checking out if you live in the neighborhood!

Wow!  For those you who can't stand waiting in the waiting room of a doctor's office and feel your blood pressure raising by the minute feeling like yet another doctor's office gives no consequence to the importance of your time since they are double or triple booking their appointments, this office is for you! Clean, modern, nicely decorated waiting room.  Efficient front office staff.  Misti Barteli, D.O. was efficient and friendly.  I did not feel rushed.  I felt like she would have answered any questions had I had any.  My appointment was at 1:45pm and I was out by 2:20pm.  Made me so happy!   Why not  a 5-star?  The front office staff could have been a little friendlier.  They were efficient but I felt like I was barked at, just a little.

Not all Sprout's are created equal. This location by far is my favorite. I love the products carried by Sprout's in general so every time there is one close by where I am, that's where I go. I've been to quite a few different ones around Phoenix.   The customer service at this location exceeds the others. They should be a shining example of how all the other Sprout's if not all grocery stores should treat their customers.   Their coffee is usu full & hot. If they're out, they quickly replace it so you can have your shot of caffeine. (Keeping you happy!)  One time, I dropped a squash on the ground. I felt mortified. The fresh produce guy not only bent over to pick it up for me, told me not to worry then proceeded to hand me a fresh one . . . with a song!  I kid you not, he sang to me!  I regularly joke around with the cashiers. It's great here. If you're in the neighborhood, stop by!

OMG~ generally I like Massage Envys.  It's a hit or miss whether you get a good or bad therapist and you have to learn to ask for specific ones~ the good thing is you can almost get an appointment last minute. BUT at this particular location, the staff seems to have forgotten they are a massage place and not a used car lot!!!! I came out of the massage not entirely happy since the guy that massaged me was a bit I don't want to use the word weird, okay, weird, okay, to be kind~ not to my liking. But I decided I would still be pleasant and pay for the massage . . . at the counter, the girl checking me out just would not let me go without arm twisting me to sign up for membership!!!! She told me they were offering a membership special that was for THAT day and if I walk out the door, the special was expired.  Even after I said no I was not interested multiple times, she continued to strong sale me and would not return my credit card to me!!!! I left feeling upset and very tense, which totally negated the massage that I just received AND I also did not get my credit card back!  I had to go back to get my card. What a hassle.   I felt like I should have been PAID to have been there instead of PAYING for the service it was THAT tortuous!!!!

My son started coming here when he was 18 months old and he's now 4.  We haven't been going to the classes consistently.  There's always a break for the summer  . . . overall, we like this place.  The most important thing to consider is that my son always have fun here.  The instructors are nice and patient with the kids.  Some of my other friends wouldn't agree with me regarding the kindness and patience of the instructors . . . but I stand by my own experience here with my son and we have had only good experiences.  Well, now there's the option with going to North Valley Gymnastics.  I just don't know, I'll have to give this some thought and figure it out once summer is over.  Regardless, Arizona Sunrays is a great place to bring your kids.  I also love their Parents Night Out and $5 Sunday open gym!

I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place!   Sigh, I'd let you in on my secret haven. Imagine the Barber Shop, that the kind of place this is in real life. Place is clean, unpretentious and the price extremely reasonable. There are two ladies there who does the pedi and mani. A spa pedi is $22 (only!) and a gel French manicure is $25 (only!). I have been going to Traci but both Traci and Eva will do a fantastic job.  They also have hair cut, coloring, lash extension, and facial services.  What I mean though about it being like the Barber Shop is that I do on occasion go in to shoot the breeze with the ladies. Both of them are extremely nice and friendly and we will sit around and chat as though we're sitting on a front porch somewhere waving our fans, having lemonade.  There you have it- the best kept secret and my safe haven has been yelped!!! Well, guess these ladies are so nice and so great- everyone should know about them. Except of course when I want to get my nails done or go in for a chat!!!!

I probably come to this theatre the most out of all the theatres since this is where the monthly sometimes biweekly movies from the Independent Film of Phoenix films are shown.  I've come to really enjoy coming here after I figured out that to miss out on all the hassles of trying to park, go to the side parking lot then cut through the "alley" and you are right in front of the theatre hassle free!   Why am I sharing this secret with you, you might ask?  Well, guess cause I'm a Yelper and hey if I can help someone else out by making their lives easier, I'm willing to share my tips. The theatre is a Harkins which means it's big and clean.  And lots of movie choices. I love how friendly the staff is here.  Usu. they just wave me right in when I tell them I am there for an IFP screening. This theatre is also where the Phoenix Film Festival is held each year.  What a cool theatre to be willing to host such a great event ran in majority by volunteers. Easy to get to, right off of the 101, on Scottsdale road.

Last year my son went to a birthday here and he just could not stop talking about how much fun he had.  So this year, we had my son's birthday party here on a Wed night being that he did not have school Thurs, Fri and it was the perfect night to have it being that it was not too crowded yet enough people showed up to make it fun.  They had one game with 21 people- blue vs red, break for pizza, then another game of blue vs red vs yellow- my son and his group of friends won and they were super excited!!!  After the second game, they had cake then I gave them tokens for the games.  This setup was perfect for an 8 yr old birthday party. Any more games would have been too much.  Just by chance, Angela (one of the owners) was the high school friend of one of my friends so she gave us a tour of the facility!  The place is big- def will not have any problem for large parties.  If you don't want to buy one of their birthday packages you can set up your party in the eating area- it worked out just fine.  Everyone who worked there were super nice. The girl making the pizza even timed the food so that it was pipping hot for the boys just as the first game ended.  To share how much fun the boys had- one of them said the party was better than Mine Craft- didn't even know that was even possible?!  Lol.  I would def have another birthday party for my son here again!

I've been shopping here since they opened their doors.  Over 10 years so you can say I'm a happy loyal customer.  In the past 10 years other Asian supermarkets have opened and I do go and try them out but I always come back to Lee Lee. First, the produce here is incredibly fresh.  Esp. if you shop on a Sunday.  The produce looks like it just got picked from the farm and was trucked right over. Second, I love their varieties.  I can get all kinds of Asian vegetables you can't get in American grocery stores and at incredibly reasonable prices. Third, I love coming here on the weekend where I can come across people from all ethnicities making me feel like for a little while that there is diversity in Phoenix.   The staff doesn't always speak English but that doesn't bother me.  I love it here and I love browsing the aisles looking at food from all over the world:  African, Brazilian, Indian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese and picking up items that I've never seen or tried before. Each shopping trip feels like a trip through the United Nation of Food. Love it, love it, love it!

I've been shopping here for many years and this is a serious downgrade.  It could be me but the last few times I've been here, the items I'm used to buying they no longer carry.  Plus, prices seem more expensive.   The most disappointing part is their customer service.  It used to be when I couldn't find an item and would ask for help, someone would go out of their way to help me and make sure I found what I was looking for. The last few times, I first encountered employees who looked unhappy and harassed when I asked for help.  This last time, the young man that helped me looked surly.  Like he didn't like me and I'm his costumer!  He showed me a gas stove to be used for hot pot, it was the last one and the case was broken.  He glossed over this fact hoping I wouldn't notice.  When I pointed out to him the case was broken, he very unkindly told me that may be the case but nothing is wrong with the gas stove itself. *Sigh* I'll probably still shop here as there are not very many options for Asian grocery stores here in Phoenix but I won't be walking in and out of there with a smile like I used to!

I started taking my now 3 year old son to Desert Stages Theatre when he was 18 months old and the first play we saw there was Seussical.  The theatre is a "in the round" theatre which means the actors come in from all 4 corners of the theatre and it's very interactive. Well, my son at 18 months was completely mesmerized by the play, the customes, the singing, and the acting. When he turned 3, I took him for an audition for Peter Pan.  He was selected as a pirate and was he ever excited!! He loves being in the play and as a parent, I have been completely impressed by the level of professionalism of the actors and how they look out for one another.  There is absolutely nothing less than glowing reviews I can write about this place both from being in the audience and now behind the scenes. And did I mention ticket prices for the Children's Theatre is only $12/ticket?   LOVE this place and highly recommend to anyone with small children!

Time flies by fast as they say and it's totally true.  My son is now 4 and he's in his 3rd play at Desert Stages Theatre.    For his second play, he was in Cinderalla played ensemble and a butler.  Now he is in Charlotte's Web playing ensemble and a photographer.  By now, I know that DST is a perfectly safe and nurturing place to leave my son.  I don't worry at all when I drop him off for play practice.  I know that the actors there are responsible and will look out for the smaller and younger actors.  The actors are kids and there are the occasional hiccups but majority of the time, the actors are mature and simply amazing.  All good kids going to good schools and here at DST because they want to be there, not because the parents are dragging them there.  The parents that I've met there are dedicated parents who make it work despite their tremendously busy schedule.  They are warm and loving and truly care about their kids.    There are quite a few families who call DST their second home.  That in itself tells you what a great place this is for your kid(s).  Parents and kids alike give back quite a bit to the theatre because throughout the years, they've felt DST and Laurie have given much to them.  Audrey Johnson, the parent coordinator, is always so on top of things, it really makes things so much easier for the rest of us.  As Andrew is 4 and DST is the only theatre where we've done plays so I don't have much to compare with but I feel blessed that this is our first theatre experience because it's been so wonderful.   Truly, the performances are a joy to watch but if you are ever thinking of getting your little one into a play, DST is a fabulous place for your little one!

My love with DST continues.  My son is now 5 and in his fourth play at DST.  This time he plays Asst to Drake and Asst Police Officer in Annie Jr. and has two lines to say, "Call him!" and "Yes sir!"  The amazing part of all this is watching him develop as an actor and also his love for theatre.    Since he is 5, I don't put any pressure on him when it comes to "learning his lines" and play practices and it touches me that despite the rigorous play practice schedule, he never says he doesn't want to go to practice.  In fact, he looks forward to it.  He's there because he wants to be there.  And it surprises me when he comes home and tells me things like "we are going off script next week" and life skills like "even when you forget what you are suppose to do, don't stop, just keep going", "smile when the audience is watching you", "show up on time."   And it surprises me even more when he starts singing the songs memorized from attending play practices and reciting complete scenes playing the different characters.  The best part though is that I know he's old enough now and DST is a completely safe environment  that I just drop him off at the backstage door and I no longer go in with him for play practices.  It's like a rite of passage that he's growing up.  Speaking of rites of passages, I've observed other actors who stuttered or were very shy when I met them 2 years ago stuttering less and becoming less shy.  It just touches me that there is a nuturing place like the DST for the children to come.  Not to mention the directors are always amazing and wonderful.  For each of his plays, my son has worked with a different director and each time, I am blown away and completely impressed at the maturity and vision of the directors.  The cast is big because they want to give as many children as possible the opportunity to be in a play and every time, by the time tech week is over, the play is entertaining and professional.  This time, the director was Angela Kreiss and she was just unbelievably fantastic.  Annie Jr. is a fabulous play to watch for both adults and children.  You can't go wrong whether you are thinking of getting your child into theatre or want to watch a play by coming to DST . . . have I mentioned how great I think this place is??

Yes, before you ask, I still love Desert Stages Theatre, perhaps more than ever.  This is Andrew's fifth play there and this time he plays the Knave in Alice in Wonderland. Normally, we don't ask for a specific role but the director of Annie Jr. thought he would be cute as the Dormouse as he popped up from the table so that's what we asked for this time during audition. And we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted.  When the casting was posted, he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent, I was glad. Why you may ask?  Because to me as a mom and a parent, it's very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude.  When he asked why he didn't get the part, I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role.  I also told him that it doesn't matter what role you get, if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts, you will capture the audience's attention and that will be your moment. He listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave.  And I was also excited for him because this time around, he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak! With each review, I've written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here I've included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsG07sMlZ5s&feature=related.  This time around, he started asking me if he was a main character, starting to understand the structure of a performance.  It was great to see his awareness growing.  I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here.   It will be an amazing experience!! Really, DST is about the kids.  Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities.  Once the curtain lifts, the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other.  It's fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage, being responsible for moving and arranging the set, take care of the tech, go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage.  It's all fabulous. If you have doubts of what kids can do, go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed.  Truly, if you believe in your kids, as DST shows again and again, your kids will shine and raise above your expectations!

Dare I write this . . . this place is better than Starbucks, this place is a hidden gem!  I walked into this place  not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.  Each time I've been here the staff has been warm and friendly. I've ordered from their breakfast menu, lunch menu and of course the coffees and everything has been delicious. I love how they have a private room where you can set up to write or read all day at your leisure. It's a very comfortable space, decorated to make you feel welcome. After coming here once I was so pleased that every chance I get, I stop by. They also have live music on the weekends. A great place to meet for just coffee or if you're hungry also for lunch and dinner!  In case you're wondering what's good, all items in the menu are delish!

This morning I came in here for coffee and breakfast and I was estatic to see this place PACKED!  The furnishings here are comfortable so the patrons were drinking coffee, having breakfast and socializing away. There were also people with laptops working (free wifi) and a group meeting taking place in the cozy, sun lit room available for free!   Coming in from the cold, the warmth of the cafe was a welcoming change and the delicious smell of good coffee immediately put me in a good mood.  As I don't really like breakfast food, I love coming here cause they will let you order off of the lunch menu even at 8am in the morning! So I ordered my favorite which is the smoked salmon salad.  This is the kind of neighborhood coffee joint that I love and missed- I don't know the reason why I came in here the first time since the exterior is deceiving vanilla in a non descript strip mall like much of Phoenix. Whatever the reason, I'm glad I did cause I simply love this place!

2 reviews in 2 days for my favorite coffee joint!  This morning (like many other mornings lol) I rushed out of the house without eating but secretly I was already looking forward to coming here since I had an hour b4 my next appointment.  So here I am enjoying the pleasant, comfy atmosphere listening to Christmas music. There's a networking meeting in the private room you can reserve to us for free. People eating bfast, relaxing and browsing on their phone or tablet.  I had been eyeing their lunch special of corn beef and Swiss sandwich with a side for awhile so that's what I ordered. The sandwich comes in a French roll toasted- just perfect for my hungry stomach this morning! Of course I need to mention the friendly staff here. Everyone always so friendly and helpful. And patient too cause some mornings when I've been here my brain is still sleeping and they've always bantered with me while my brain woke up.  Love this hidden gem!

I've tried several of their dishes at this Flo's location and they've been all good.  What keeps me coming back again and again is their hot and sour soup~ made fresh, full of flavor with large pieces of white chicken meat and large shrimps.  Usually, when I am feeling under the weather, like today, I stop by Flo's for a quick "pick me up" of their aromatic and delicious hot and sour soup and after consuming the large bowl, big enough for four people, I felt better and left a happy customer~ along with a to go order of wonton soup to nurse my coughing throat for later on in the day.

Been here several times and each time, I still feel like the prices are still too high.   Each time I browse the store and leaving, empty handed.  When I am buying something "Nordstrom", I want the service and the environment that is associated with this brand.  I wait for the semi and annual sales at Nordstrom (without the Rack) and I get the superior service Nordstrom is known for, in a gorgeous setting and still pay about the same amount of money.  To me, that's money better spent.

I usually don't go to RA since the only one that I thought was close to my house was the one in Old Town Scottsdale and the place was not to my liking.   Recently, I discover their Kierland Commons location which has a great outdoor seating area and it's spacious with their signature red decor.  The other thing I discovered was their Happy Hour menu, which I must say, is probably one of the best in town in terms of prices and offerings. $1 sake, sushi like salmon and yellowtail for $2.50, generous servings for friend calamari for less then $4, shrimp cerviche for less than $5.  This is my new fav place for happy hour- I can hang out here, eat my full, drink all the sake I want without breaking the bank!

Well, I must first confess that I'm not a big ice cream eater. I didn't grow up eating ice cream and even as an adult, I haven't grown to like it but I know there are plenty of other people who do . . . So to those that love ice cream, Cold Stone is prob worth it. Unfortunately, to me it just seem really expensive for what you get. :(

I can't review about the classes here. We bought a birthday package from our school silent auction fundraiser so this is what my review is on.  I really didn't know what to expect for a birthday party since gymnastic places are generally very busy especially on a weekend.  I was instructed to book on a Sunday so I did. When we arrived, we had the WHOLE place to ourselves. I was soooo surprised!!!!!  Plus we had two hostesses for the party.  It was great!!!  The hostesses took the kids through the varies activities from the rope climbing to the blueberry pit to other gymnastic activities. The kids had a great time! Us parents had an upstairs area where we could sit to see what the kids were doing.  After the gymnastic activities, all the kids and parents upstairs to a private room where they had the plates and balloons set up- even a big happy birthday sign. The birthday package included a cake plus ice cream!!!  One thing for sure, the party impressed all the other parents.  They kept asking me if I had reserved the whole place for the party.  Most importantly, the kids had the best time ever!!!!!

Came here with a group of 20 after they had their poker night.   Everything on their menu was fried, fried, and more fried.  Not one healthy item!  And I was a bit afraid to drink the water they served me cause I wasn't  sure if the cup was clean since quite a few of the plates the waitress brought out for the appetizers were dirty.  The upside was the waitress was friendly and the company I was with was fun.  Def would not come here on my own or be one of my choices if I was the organizer!

I like this B&N mainly because of the great children section upstairs. I like going there with my son and spend a couple of hours browsing and reading. They have a nice table there with chairs kid size where you can read with your child. And the employees don't seem to mind when you are reading out loud. Some days there are kids getting tutored there. They also have a decent collection of kid toys. Overall, it's a good store at a good location. I read a couple of reviews about the lack of parking. If you swing around to their "back" side from where there is also an entrance, there are more parking spaces that are open there.

I am writing a one star review hoping to catch the eye of someone at Enterprise Corporate.  What is happening to your company???  As a long time Enterprise car renter, I am sooo disappointed with my last car rental experience with your company!!!  Still loves:  the prompt pick up and drop off service- thumbs up. The quick and easy check in and check out- thumbs up. The cleanliness of the cars- thumbs up.  Thumbs down: 1.  I was given a car that had cosmetic blemishes on the car- minor issue and I was okay as long as the car worked . . . but when did car rental companies start to rent less than perfect cars? 2.  The interior fabric of the car seats was stained- again, when did car rental companies start to rent less than perfect cars? 3.  I love going to Enterprise cause everyone dresses in a suit.  This time, the men were dressed in a suit but there was one woman there dressed in . . . grunge style clothing???  I felt like asking was there a rave going on in the back parking lot???  Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the costumer service and knowledge of the reps.  I ended up renting for 40 days.  READ the big 4-0.  And no one once mentioned to me about the Enterprise Plus loyalty program.    Renting for 40 days puts you past the Plus, Silver statuses and get you right into the Gold status and no one mentions it to me???  To make matters worse, when I called this location and spoke to one of the managers name Nate he tells me he doesn't know much about the loyalty program, does not know what the benefits are and he actually said to me he has nothing to do with the loyalty program.  Hmmm, he does work for Enterprise and he knows how businesses thrive by cultivating costumer loyalty, right?  Right???  Unless this guy Nate is a personal relative of the Enterprise family, he should be demoted or retrained or something.  I could not believe my ears.  Now, apparently, after many minutes on the phone to "central location", because no one bothered to tell me about the Enterprise Plus program as I was renting or paying at this local location, I can only get credit for rentals the last 30 days grandfathered into my account.  Which means I will miss out on 19 days of rental which means I will not get my Gold status which adds up to one frustrated and unhappy costumer.  Come on, Enterprise- honestly, I've been renting from you since 1986- every single time I've needed a car, I rent from you.  Make me happy and give me my 40 days of rental added to my loyalty card and train your employees properly!!!    I want to love you with all my heart again!!!

Wow, I just read through the 20 reviews and it seems like customer satisfaction is all over the place and there's a def fav for Laura. Well, it's yelps and I can only yelp about my own experience and I have to write that I had an excellent experience when I went to this little gem for some brow shaping. The first impression I get when I entered the Brow Lady was that the place felt very inviting and warm.  There were coffee, water, cookies, candy for your delectable pleasure.   The receptionist was very friendly and accomodating.   And the lady who shaped my brow took the time to look at my brows carefully before shaping and she was also warm and friendly and I thought did a very good job with my brows. After the brow shaping session but she and the receptionist invited me to get a cup of coffee and some snacks and to sit in their inviting looking, comfy sofa to relax and take a breather. Overall, it was an excellent experience.  Being that I mentioned friendly and comfortable quite a few times throughout this review, when you enter the Brow Lady, you can leave your frown and worries behind. When you are finished with your session, not only will you feel pampered and cared for, you will be leaving with a smile!!

I love this place.  For some reason, whenever I'm out with my friends, we eventually end up here and last night was no exception. Kazimierz is a bit of a hideaway, there's no signage on the door.  But you see that it's a bar when you see the door guy checking for ID.  The atmosphere is always dark and cozy.  There are candles on the tables but expect to take out your cell phone to shed some light on the menu so you can read and order. The drinks are good and there's always a nice live band playing to croon out some tunes for you. Sometimes, people start dancing from wherever they are sitting so it's also a good people watching venue. The place can be romantic as it's dimly lit but come here as an after dinner top off as it can get quite noisy with the music playing and you will it almost impossible to hold a conversation without shouting. If you like live music and a cool atmosphere, come to this place, you won't regret it!

Since I'm Chinese, I can only give the food at PF Chang 4 stars . . . but the day that I came here for lunch, the service was 5 stars if not 6 stars.  The waiter was so professional, so attentive I looked aroudn to make sure I wasn't on candid camera getting punked.   In fact, the service was so good, when it came time to leave a tip, my hand had a mind of its own and left a 50% tip.  And I left a happy costumer, looking forward to coming back here again and hopefully getting the same waiter!

My son (and I) have been signed with FORD Robert Black Agency coming to a year now and I have to say we have been super happy to be with them. Both Sheree and Matt (our agent) were talents themselves in the years past so they are über knowledge about the industry.  I know Matt E. has a vast base of talents yet each time I contact him, he is able to get back to me right away and answers any concerns I may have. It's fantastic! Since being with FORD, I've had multiple auditions ranging from SAG film to industry videos. My son has also had multiple auditions and has booked a web video and 2 commercials. Yes, in case you're wondering when my son booked his commercials, he jumped up and down with excitement and of course, as his mom I grinned from ear to ear with happiness for him!   FORD has a stellar international reputation and the local agency FORD Robert Black Agency of Arizona is no exception. They are one of the few SAG agencies. If you are thinking of getting representation, I would highly recommend FORDRBA!  They have open casting call each week- check their website for complete details!

A girlfriend came in from out of town and we decided to treat ourselves to a weekend stay at this posh resort and did we ever enjoy ourselves! We stayed in one of the delectable suites with full living room, dining room, etc. etc.~ the only regret was that we didn't call some of our friends and had a party in our casita while we were there! Everything was perfect, we enjoyed ourselves playing tennis, taking classes at the fitness center, dining at Elements and treating ourselves to massages at the spa. Aaaahhhh!

Sanctuary you've been replaced.  Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot.  Loved. Loved. the service. Robe got slightly damp from use, helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one.  Loved the waterfall treatment.  Loved private rooftop pool.  Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water.  Loved the fitness classes, the facility. All this for $50 during AZ Spa Week.   The facility and service is so f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it!

I think I'm biased.  I love the arts so any facility that supports the arts, I'm going to naturally give it 5 stars. My hubby and I saw Mama Mia here the other night (thanks for the tkts Yelp and ASU Gammage)- we sat in row 21 seats 48 and 50. We had a good view of the stage and could see everything clearly.  Personally, when I watch a live performance, I like to sit at row 15 or closer cause I like to see the minute facial expressions of the actors but nonetheless, row 21 were very good seats.   Mama Mia! was an excellent show (oh, I love anything ABBA!). It was quick and engaging. And the cast coud really sing!  There were a few parts though where I thought it was not appropriate for young children.   Gammage itself is a classic. I have to admit, when I see the loooong row of seats with no break in the middle, I do feel a certain fear wondering what would happen to the people sitting in the center should there be a major fire outbreak?  I also try to go to the bathroom before so I don't have to go during intermission. I mean, the bathrooms are few and the lines long that I could be in line, my legs crossed and still not get the chance to go to the bathroom during the 15 min intermission.   Regardless, I love the shows they bring here and no matter what the facility conditions are, I love the shows here and will come here again and again to enjoy the shows!!!!

I am updating with 5 stars for the programming and for my love of the Arts.  And 3 stars for having long rows with no breaks in them for traffic flow.  My son and I were there 2 nights ago where we saw the best of the state high schoolers perform in an orchestra. The highs schoolers were terrific. And the conductor connected great with the audience.  My 8 yr old son was my date and we sat smack in the middle of this very, very, very long row. Then he had to go to the bathroom. We had no choice but to interrupt the patrons again and again and again and again . . . You get the idea. Everyone was very nice about it. That's the good part. The other good part was even after saying what felt like a hundred excuse me's my son, thankfully made it to the bathroom in time!

Geez, Mike D. TMI, TMI. But I guess it's good information for the X chromosome- but do guys really care how clean your bathroom is or how tightly the door closes??? Okay, I digress. Well, Mike D. the Y- bathroom was just fine. Not fancy but clean.  And the door closes.  Sorry folks for the banter before I write about the food and service.  Our group was running Ragnar and we came in here looking for a warm and hearty breakfast. I think the state we were in, anything would have tasted out of this world. And it did! Service was friendly, helpful. The food came out fast. The price extremely reasonable.  I love places like the Wagon Wheel where the moment you walk in, they treat you like an old friend regardless of how you look, dress, or smell.  Not only do you get a great serving of food, you get a great serving of human decency as well. And that's worth any price and I'm sure that's one of many reasons why they have many regulars.  It was my first and only time here but I reckon places like these has its regulars and loyal following since I know if I lived close by, this place would be my regular go to place for breakfast!

Until you've had your own kids, you will not understand the second guessing you put yourself through wondering if you are doing what is best for your child. My son has been at Dynamite Montessori for a year now and I can honestly say both my husband and I are very happy with the school and the school's director, Ms. Paula. There is great communication between all the staff.  As soon as you communicate your concern to one person, the whole staff including Ms. Paula is aware of your concern and addresses the concern IMMEDIATELY.  It's absolutely fantastic. As a first time parent, I have been very impressed by the Montessori system taught by the school.  If you want your child to be independent and self sufficient, this is the place to come.  It's really amazing how much your child can learn if you just step back and let them learn! And have I written about how amazing the campus is?  This school is not located in some stripe mall- it's on 5 acres with its own tennis courts and soccer field.  Lessons are taught outside in the full wrap around patio when the weather is nice.  They have a vegetable garden, animals that are taken care of by the children, and a playground. I guess this is turning into a pretty long review because I just can't write enough nice things about this place. I am so thankful to have enroll my son in this school and have seen my son's incredible growth this past year! Don't let me forget to mention that cost of tuition includes soccer and Spanish lessons!

We ordered food from this restaurant for my son's birthday party. The owners forgot about the order day of the event- due to their neglect, we didn't get the food we ordered, my husband ended up missing 45 minutes of our son's party. The owner did not ask for payment when my husband got the food- so we thought reasonably the food was free to compensate for their mistakes. We do not hear from them for almost 6 weeks then they called our house day and night demanding payment. Oh yes, it gets worse- they ended up suing us in civil court over a bill that was less than $200!! It was a total nightmare experience. Don't have any dealings with this restaurant!!

My book club met here for lunch to talk about our latest book set in Italy and the initial impression was it was a fabulous choice. I loved the decor, the atmosphere and looking at the menu, I had the impression that the food would be delicious.   The bread was certainly delicious although it was served with butter and not olive oil. Regardless, the bread was still mouth watering. Especially the one with the sage & thyme flavor.   I think my friends enjoyed what they ordered- all the dishes looked delicious when the food came. All of them remarked how much they liked their house salads- esp. the tangy red wine vinegar salad dressing.   I had ordered the pork sausage on Savoy cabbage with polentas. When the dish came, the presentation looked great. 3 pieces of beautifully grilled polentas, 2 pork sausage links on a bed of Savoy cabbage. That is, until I took a bite of the dish!    It was soooooo salty that I felt like I was eating a salt lick!  I could feel my eyes bulge out it was so, so, so very salty.   I thought to myself: "wow, if I was a deer, I would be super happy just about now cause I felt like I had opened up a jar of salt and was pouring it into my mouth!!!    There might have been flavor to the dish but I couldn't taste anything but the salt cause . . . . It was soooo salty!!!  When I mentioned it to the waiter, he did not offer to take back the dish or offer compensation. He merely shrugged his shoulders.   One of my friends remarked how snubby he seemed which was a disappointment to me since I usually receive good service.   Another friend told me I should not have to pay for the meal if it was that bad. I still paid. Right now, 6 hours later even after 2 hours of playing tennis, my mouth still feels completely salty. You know the feeling.   So if you have high blood pressure or diabetes you should not order the pork sausage dish. If you are a deer in human disguise looking for a salt lick then by all means go for it!!!

Echo Canyon . . . excellent hike up boulders that immediately takes you away from the surrounding city until you reach the summitt and when relishing your sense of accomplishment, you look around and is reminded again that you are in the midst of the city!  A def hike time well spent.  Parking can be a bit crazed.    Apparently, you are no longer allowed to hap hazardly park along side the street and in other people's driveways any longer . . . cars are parked either in the VERY SMALL lot or at 56th St. & McDonald and you have to walk the mile to the trailhead.  During prime hiking hours there are actually three park rangers there to enforce the new rules and to direct traffic.  And you are no longer allowed to stalk a potential spot since cars tend to pile up quickly behind you.  So it's drive in and drive out.    No fear though, pretend you are in high school and cruising main street . . . and it's worth the burning of gas as spots open up quickly.   My friends and I made it up to the top in 38 mins last time . . . one of them said she said she used to be able to run up the trail in less than 30 mins.  Well, I guess that's my goal in my fitness quest . . . stay tuned!

When the Gelato Spot first opened, I thought it was outrageous to pay so much money for a little scoop of sweet confection and thought I would never step foot in the place.  Well, won't you know it someone had to go and get a gift certificate there for my birthday so I ended up going and well, I just love the place. This place and all their other locations is like walking into AJ's- there's something about the ambiance and sense of quality that you just want to whip out your wallet and pay out the bucks and feel good that you just spent a zillion dollars for a tiny little scoop of sweet deliciousness.  And feel like it was totally worth it. What can I say?  Some places just puts me in a brain freeze and I love every moment of it.

My friends and I were out late and we decided we wanted to try to find a place with reverse happy hour on a Saturday night.  Went online to yelp and found FEZ that was close to where we were, call the restaurant and was told indeed they have reverse happy hour on Saturday night from 10pm-12am. Perfect!  Love the atmosphere, the waiter was attentive- didn't get annoyed when I changed my drink order from wine to water and joked around with us. There were four of us.  Three of us had the lettuce wrap which was delish!  The lettuce wrap came with 5 stalks of Romaine lettuce and the chicken was mixed with cranberries, dried apricot, dates, almonds- absolutely filled with flavor.  Generous portions- enough to be a meal.  The fourth person had their chicken sandwich which was also delish.   We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks and our food and would definitely go back there again!

So I went to Stingray for a quick lunch the other day while my son was in play practice.  I walked in, the place was not crowded.  I got seated and the waitress gave me the menu.   Looking through the menu, I ordered their sushi lunch which on the menu read- 3 pieces each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, 8 pieces of California roll, 4 pieces of sushi, rice, soup, and salad for $14.  Since I was hungry, that was what I ordered. The food came in a bento box- there was the 3 pieces each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, rice and salad and I had gotten the soup beforehand.  Okay, I figured I was getting the rest of the order on the waitress's next round. My 4 pieces of sushi and 8 pieces of Californai roll never came.  When I asked the waitress about them, she came back with 4 pieces of California roll and told me that I was not getting the rest of my order because they made a mistake in printing out their "new" menu, in a rush for their new Biltmore location.  And she said it in not a very nice way as in "well, wouldn't that be a great deal to get all that food for $14!" I did not make a fuss as I was full with what was brought to me . . . when I went to pay my check, they billed me for $15 instead of $14.  When I started to get annoyed, they took a whopping $1 off my check.  Really?  One dollar?  I got half of the food that I ordered! Needless to say, I am not impressed with a place that does not honor what is PRINTED clearly in their menu- if it was a mistake, as a business owner, they should have honored the order and pulled the menu from being used.   Stingray is a cool place to go have sushi but because of their business practice of not treating their customers right, I will not likely be going back there again.

My son who is 8 has a fine palate and while he enjoys kid food like any other kid, he believe it or not, really appreciates a fine dining experience.  So when I received a $50 gift certificate to Capital Grille (thanks to Yelp!) I decided to take him there to celebrate the last days of summer and first day of school.  The truth is, you don't see too many kids at the Capital Grille especially during the lunch hour.  Mainly, you see the business crowd so I was a little concerned with how Andrew would be received.  My worries were for naught. Our waiter, Jose, was fantastic. He had small children of his own and he treated Andrew with such brilliance that as a parent, I was impressed and grateful. He answered every question Andrew had with patience from how is the burger cooked to if extra lemonade is free. He also showed Andrew how to use the scraper to clean off the table. It was so enjoyable we were there for over an hour and a half and Jose never made us feel as though he was wishing the table to be free for the next customers.  I could go on and on about how great Jose is and what a wonderful dining experience we had . . . . I should talk about the food too. We both ordered from their summer pre fixe menu- I had the watermelon and arugula salad and the scallop over risotto. Andrew had their angus burger with fries. Both were large portioned and plenty filling.  And absolutely delicious. Both of us loved our entrees! During the lunch, the manager even came by and said hello to BOTH Andrew and I.  Andrew being 8, could have been totally brushed off by the manager and the waiter- Capital Grille showed itself for the fine establishment that its reputation stands for and treated Andrew with such enthusiasm and respect that I was very appreciative for such a fine dining experience for both of us!

I feel like a douche bag for giving Matt's only 1 stars when everyone else raves about this place and the owner truly is such a delight so in my defense let me explain: This place is a hot spot, every time I've tried to go there, it's packed.  Each time, I've never wanted to wait so I went on my way. One Sunday, I was just down the street from them at Valley Youth Theatre watching Winnie the Pooh with my son and I thought how great it would be to take my son to this popular joint for a bit of breakfast afterward.  When we got out of the theatre, it was pouring rain in giant buckets, one of those rarities in Phoenix where you can't see what's in front of you cause it's raining so hard.  Well, we braved the rain and drove to Matt's~ 5 mins. after their posted closing time and yup, you guess it~ despite me and my 3 1/2 year old son drenched wet and  looking pleadingly at them for some warm food and a place to stay for awhile to get out of the rain, they told us they were closed and sent us on our way.  Talk about tough standards~ I guess when you are as popular as Matt's you get to make and stick by the rules you make. Despite that experience, I still wanted to try Matt's because of all the applaudes I've heard about the place. Finally I made it there on one of those days when I had the time for the long wait and sadly for me, I was sorely disappointed by the breakfast served to me. I had remembered reading some article about the BIG BREAKFAST served at Matt's and that's what I was expecting.  I ordered the waffle with bacon for $9 expecting a Denny's portion of food but with flavor and excellence.  The place was packed so I had to wait 30mins for my waffle to materialize in front of me.  When I got the one piece of waffle and one piece of bacon served to me, I thought perhaps while waiting I had accidentally swallowed Alice (in Wonderland) tonic and was now a giant looking at my rather small serving of food on my plate.  Seriously, I almost felt tears come into my eyes, I was so disappointed.  Needless to say, after trying so many times to go to Matt's and finally getting there just to have not a big breakfast but a are you kidding me?  where's the rest of my food experience, I will not go back there.  It's a good thing too cause it's far from my house and I hate waiting!

It's hard to write the dim sum is bad when you arrive hungry!!!  Both my son & I were famished and as soon as we sat down, the carts filled with delicious morsels started to stop by our table.    As usual, we selected more food than 2 people can possibly eat but we didn't care as everything was yummy to the tummy!!!  My son kept saying, "Mom, this here food is soooo good!!!"   We don't have dim sum that often so we indulged and between the 2 of us ordered about 10 dishes . . . if you eat dim sum, you can attest that this is a lot of food!!!  And we enjoyed every bit of it- with plenty of left overs to take home, of course.  Are there left overs in dim sum or just another delicious morsel for later???  Hmmm, something to ponder.  Haha.

As Lindsey D.'s review is the first one that popped up when I started to write my own review, I have to say as usual Lindsey D. wrote an excellent review and pretty wrote everything that I would want to write about this particular Harkins. I will add though that as a long time resident of Phoenix, I'm giving this Harkins 5 stars for nostalgic reasons like this particular Harkins has been around long enough for the building to be, in my opinion, a Phoenix landmark. Every city needs their "cool" theatre that shows more of the independent genre movies~ the fact that this one is a Harkins I hope is a testament that this particular movie theatre building and location will still be here many years to come. I also like that the lobby feels smaller and more intimate and not like the mega theatres some of them can be.

I can't believe I've never stopped in here to have lunch before. This restaurant is family owned, laid back, and the owner personally serves you.  But let's talk about the food. I ordered the chicken pita for $7.95 and when my friend told me the portion was generous- she was not kidding!  We shared the entree and there was still enough left over for me to take home for another meal!   The chicken breast cubed were tender and full of flavor. Look at the photos- you will not be disappointed by the food served here. And the lunch specials come with a side salad and a drink. All for $7.95!   I will definitely be back again. And again and again!  Hidden gem!!!

One word can describe the food here:  perfection.  All the meals I've had here has been absolutely delicious served by the most charming waitstaff.  Someone recently told me their Chilean Sea Bass was the best he's ever had and I believe him . . . I can't wait to taste that dish!

I just love this place. The vibe and food here is always just the right mix of excellence, deliciousness, and coolness.  If vibes can be bottled, capture the vibe here to enhance your own personality, home, or business.  Will sure to turn it into a winner!

I think AMC has snagged me ever since I got sucked into paying to be a Stubs Reward member~ the thing is, they do make getting rewarded easy so I find myself picking AMC theatres over Harkins lately. Location is convenient, right off of Tatum and the 101.  Parking can be a bit of a nightmare as Desert Ridge is a popular mall. The trick is to drive north on Tatum and then turn right on Deer Valley then turn right I can't remember the name of the street but then you can drive straight to the AMC and miss all the internal traffic that is part of Desert Ridge. $5 matinee movies can't be beat either!

Had a craving for donburi!  So I came in here with my son.  The menu was extensive good chocies between sushi and non sushi items.  We were not that hungry so I ordered one dish to be shared between my son and I.  I felt bad for the waitress and she couldn't help but give us a stare.  Luckily, my son was so charming and loving and funny that by the end of the meal he had totally won her over and I left a tip amount as though we had ordered two entrees. The only disappointment was of course the donburi.  The donburi I crave for and remember is a donburi from long ago when I was a student at Ann Arbor where they would pile on the rice in a big bowl and pile on top a big pile of gooey mixture of onion, egg, and chicken.  It was soooo good!  I haven't been able to find the remembered donburi anywhere else since then. I think I need to recreate it in my own kitchen to satisfy not necessarily my stomach but my memory.  Not kidding.

I love all the Villages.  Finally settled on DC Ranch since it was closest to my house.  For awhile, I was going every day since I was training for the Tour the Tucson.  Since I was going there every day, I noticed quite a few things~ the friendly staff regardless of the hour or time of day, the diligence in keeping the health club 100% clean without feeling intrusive, and everyone I came across was a pleasure. I saw weight lifting equipment that was out of order fixed by the next day.  Spencer and Kevin Shephard at weight lifting really know what they are talking about, Mandy Campbell was great to work with on the pilates machine, Chris Warmbold is great in membership.  And the members were always friendly to me. The amazing thing about the Villages as I have experienced not only at DC Ranch is that the environment turns working out from a chore to a pleasure.  For this I'm thankful. If you want to go to a place not just for working out but looking for a community as well, this place is for you!

This restaurant hovers at 3.5 stars . . . my husband and I came here for lunch.  We ordered the seafood bebimbop in hot stone bowl, clear rice noodle soup with short rib, and the rice cake soup with beef.   The seafood bebimbop in hot stone bowl was our favorite.  Having this dish in the hot stone bowl makes all the difference in giving this dish added flavour, always worth the extra cost. The other two dishes were good but a little bland. The waitress was very nice, service was good.  I loved the furniture but thought the interior could use a little face lift . . . maybe a new paint job. The furniture themselves were so exquisite that I could see the place having a totally different atmosphere if the walls were painted a muted, light color with minimal decoration and the furniture themselves were highlighted,   It would def enhance the dining experience and draw more people in because really, the food and service was good. Maybe they'll trade me food for my interior design suggestions . . .

Since my last review over 3 years ago, this place has a whole new look and vibe. It's more than twice as big as it used to be with a more hangout/ bar atmosphere. There are a lot more younger staff working here- not sure if it has new owners. I like all the changes. The other night I came here late with my son and it was great since they are open until late. Their menu is varied and extensive. If you don't find something that suits your taste buds then I think you must be an extremely picky eater! My son and I had the bulgogi with four side dishes, six pieces of sushi ($14.95) plus a California roll ($3.95). Plenty of food for 2 people with leftovers.  The waitress was super friendly and took a liking to my son so she couldn't stop smiling when she came over. Which is great cause a smile goes a long way under any occasion! The place reminds of a LA joint now for both old, young, bar, non-bar going crowd alike. I like it. I hope it does well and become more and more successful as the city grows!

Sooo . . . I've been coming on and off to this place since it first opened and it has gone through several incarnations from buffet to sit down to something in betwn that I really wasn't sure what was being served when I opened their door this past Sat.  Much to my pleasant surprise, the place was bustling serving dim sum a plenty. And the place was packed with my kind of people (Chinese in case you're wondering. Haha) so I figured the dim sum must be pretty good.  I was not disappointed. Everything I had was up to standard. I had 5 dishes plus got charged 65 cents for having water and the tea that was not served to me.  When I questioned the 65 cents and told the owner I did not have tea, he pointed to a handwritten sign taped to the cash register hidden behind stacks of to go menus that said 65 cents charged to every customer for tea AND WATER. Okay, I didn't realize when I crossed the threshold I had been transported to China or Europe where they do charge for water.  I also questioned an item where they charged me for a large item when I only had the small dishes and boy, did the owner insist on every penny!  Okay, dude I won't argue with you. So somehow for five dishes, water, and tea that I didn't get the bill came to a whopping $17 which I thought was freakin' expensive for dim sum at lunch time. When I saw the bill I almost wish I could have thrown up the food and return the dishes back to them. Alas, I couldn't and didn't so I paid my bill and left.  Sigh, since dim sum has become trendy and popular I think it's driven up the price!  I remember when I could have 5 dishes for less than $10!  Oh, the good 'ole days!

I love Costcos. Why?  Because I can't seem to spend less than an hour there each time I go and I always buy more items than I intend. I also love what I call my "Costco lunches". Best time to go I think are at 11am then a little after 1pm for the most selections. These "Costco lunch" actually work since I often grab  a bag of whatever I sampled. Plus, I also count the walking I do there part of my daily  workout. Remember that, girls, you can nibble free cause the calories consumed  are offset by the walking.

Had a massage here today by buying a Groupon Now!  The facility is new, staff friendly. My massage therapist was fantastic. He oozed "I love and care about you" abundantly out of his pores. So naturally the massage was great. Some people have the touch to levitate your aches and pain . . . I definitely felt better after the massage. So much better that I went to shopping therapy after!

I'm surprised by the low reviews for Pei Wei.  I, frankly, like the food here and I love how they will customize your meal if you tell them to add or delete certain ingredients. And I've never had any problems getting my food in a timely manner. By chance, I discovered their edamame is out of this world!  It's sautéed in sea salt and ginger and extremely tasty.  I've tried to remake this at home but haven't quite gotten the flavor as good as theirs yet. The fact that this location is consistently busy attests to their philosophy of good food, quick, at reasonable prices. I also like how they try to change out their menus so that it's not the same items month after month, year after year. I've always loved their concept every since they opened and I hope they continue to thrive here and elsewhere in Phoenix!

I love living in Phoenix.  There's no doubt about it.  This city to me is restaurant/bar heaven.  It seems like every day, a new restaurant is opening with a new twist on some new kind of cuisine.  And don't get me wrong- I love that and am an avid trier of new places. But there are some days when I earn for the simple, straight forward Chinese food I remembered eating growing up on the East Coast where good eats were plenty in the Chinatowns of New York and Philadelphia. There are some of those places in Chandler and Mesa but I live in North Phoenix and don't always want to make the drive. Well, I was pretty excited to discover Nee House- I love the food there- it's simple and it's always good.  They have a great selection of seafood entrees that puts both my son and myself in heaven.   The decor is simple and unpretentious- I always feel relaxed there and know that I am going to get fed some mouth watering delicious dishes! After this glowing review, why 4 stars instead of 5?  Because of the wait- the place can get pretty packed.  I always feel like I need to get there early to get a table without the wait- too bad the restaurant doesn't offer any "early bird" specials!

Well . . . I guess I'll join the " I LOVE JULIA BAKER " band wagon!!! As part of a Yelp event, Julia was there and oozed charisma. She was funny, engaging, and full of passion for her chocolate everything. I'm pretty sure everyone who meets her, falls in love with her. She's one of those girls, yup, she's like that.  She told us her story, taught us how to discern quality chocolate the Dr. Oz way with canisters of cocoa, fat, sugar displayed in an easy to understand graphic matter. Best way to dispense important information- so simple and clear even a 5 yr old can understand it.  From there, things just got deliciously better. She treated us to not just one but three decadent desserts beautifully presented in the best fashionable way. I'm not one to eat dessert but I made an exception for Julia. Because I recognize quality dessert when I see it and to pass up anything quality well, that's just not my style.  True to my eye's opinion, the chocolate, red velvet, and lemon with coconut were all palate spoiling happiness. If you asked me to pick a favorite, I couldn't because in the world of perfect sweets, I love them all equally! On top of already feeling like I've reached heaven, we paired the desserts with my oh soooo favorite drink of choice- yes, you guess it- bubbly champagne. So crisp, just the right amount of sweetness.  What?  You say we were in Phoenix? I would say we were in a Parisan cafe, enjoying the sort of evening that creates memories. Especially when already I was feeling the gratitude of a wonderful moment, a chocolate martini was served to me. I thought omg! I can't handle anymore wonderfulness. But again, I made an exception for Julia and her confections.  You can write that there are better chocolates out there but there are no combination of Julia Baker and chocolates. That's right, she and her chocolates are definitely one of a kind!   Thanks Julia for the relishing experience!

Until recently, Sanctuary Spa was my fav spa in Phoenix.  Regardless, this spa is a first class facility with immaculate customer service.  If you want to feel pampered and special, this is the place to come.   And block out the whole day to enjoy this place~ it is gorgeous and very relaxing!

Dr. Sabitino is great.  He is like your next door uncle, unrelated by blood but totally adoptable.  His staff is great too.  All women and all very friendly and professional. I think what drew my husband and I into deciding to use him as the orthodontist for our son is the bright cheerfulness of the woman who meets all the potential patients and the bright, clean, modern look of his office.  We just felt very comfortable there the moment we walked into the office. He has provided excellent care for our son.  Anytime my son had an issue, we were able to call and he would see him right away.  Nothing is too small or too big to make sure things are done right and my son is happy with his braces or retainer. I've called a couple of times with concerns for his retainer and my concerns were taken care of right away.  Which is what every parent wants.   I would highly recommend this office to any mom or dad looking for an orthodontist for themselves or their kids.  I think you would be very happy with the services you will receive here.  From the front receptionist to the technicians to Dr. Sabitino himself. And if you do end up going to Dr. Sabitino from reading this Yelp review, can you mention my name for two reasons:  one, to let Dr. Sabitino I appreciate what he is doing for my son and I'm Yelping about him and two cause I think I get a free tooth brush if he gets new patients from me . . . just kidding about the second reason~ although, I would not mind getting new tooth brushes- can always use them!  It's really because I want Dr. Sabitino to know that he has satisfied patients and we are happy with him!

I joined the JCC for the close proximity to my son's school. I can go work out either right after drop off or right before I go and pick him up. My favorite part of JCC is their swimming pool. Being that it's salt water, it's easy on my hair and skin. I don't feel like to need to shower right after swimming and my hair doesn't suffer either. I also enjoy their steam room and jacuzzi.  I also enjoy their cardio equipment, weight equipment, spin, group classes like Zumba, Pilates. The staff is super nice.  It's an extremely comfortable, down to earth and inviting atmosphere.  I'm not Jewish and I feel comfortable going there on a daily basis.  The cafe there is kosher and serves great food. My favorite is their tuna fish platter.  Delish! There seems to be a misconception you have to be Jewish to join since when I tell people I belong to the JCC, that's the first question they ask me. ALL are welcome. Membership director is Lisa and she's super nice!  So is Cynthia who is also in membership.

I went here for their reverse happy hour after I played tennis and wanted a bit of sushi before I went to bed.  I had the yellowtail sashimi and it was fresh and the slices large.  Atmosphere is casual and serves the neighborhood well.

There are times when the Asian in me screams "satisfy my taro boboa craving!!!" and I have to obey, jump in the car and start driving!  So here I am my eyes round, my tummy saying thank you, happily sipping on my taro. And munching on some fried fish balls. It almost makes me feel like I'm somewhere Asia except for the fact that after I walked in, about ten gringos walked in behind me. Service appears to be quick as everyone was quickly served. In the span of sitting here and writing this review I would say 15 people have been served quickly. Which is good cause if everyone had came in the same state that I was in, if service was slow there might have been massive boboa craving crumpiness.  And I must remark pricing is reasonable. Which is always a bonus! Thanks Yelp for having mobile review. Craving satisfied, review written, I'm happily on my way out to my next venture!

Taro and boboa. So delicious together. Wonder if you can freeze it and make it into a froze treat. I think I will try to do this. Put them together in ice cube trays then pop them in my mouth during the summer like candy bites.  Until then I enjoyed another quickly prepared and served taro boboa slush from this delightful place. Ahhhh, wish this place was closer to me or maybe not otherwise my waistline might protest!

Jennifer, Jennifer how wonderful are thee. I might be dating myself when I disclose that I've had the pleasure of eating Jennifer's cooking when she was starting out in catering. At least, I think it's the same Jennifer. Her food was scrumptious then as it is scrumptious now. And creative. And fresh.  The location is a bit hard to find but once in, the interior is delightful.   I hope her place success because of the location and she starts to have loyal costumer and a cult following. The kind of place that spreads by word of mouth and people from the neighborhood who Become regulars there all know each other one way or another. A bit of a Friend's place.  Just by chance, when Irene V. and I were there, Jennifer herself was there giving an interview to New Times- ever friendly Yelpers we introduced ourselves and Jennifer was equally friendly to us.  We had ordered the charcuterie nosh board to share and she generously gifted us with an order of her famous roasted pork Cuban sandwich which we furiously said she didn't have to- but I mean, we're Yelpers and we love food- so once arrived, we helpfully enjoyed the sandwich, exclaiming over the robust flavor! Even without the unexpected gift, I would still write a 5 star review as like I had previously written, I loved Jennifer's food when she was strictly a caterer. Back then she had said she wanted to have a restaurant and I am happy for her her dream has come true. And I wish her many years of continued success!

I'm going to very quickly write a review as I wait for my takeout. Located next to Dollar Tree in the Safeway shopping center. Now that it's under new ownership owned by a nice family, the quality of the food has definitely improved.  I love coming here now to order their moo shu chicken, hot & sour soup, yu shan chicken, lettuce wrap.  The interior has been brightened with new furniture and fresh paint & decorations. It is much nicer than before. The only thing which I am not sure how you would get rid of it is when you initially walk in, the place smells stale.  Maybe cause I got here just as they opened and the place needs to get aired out.  I love coming to family owned places especially one where the owner greets you with a warm smile. I hope this business does well. Support local, shop small!!!

I can't believe Mike O. has 111 check ins at Hana. Not only does he have the dukedom!  Hana should have a chair with his name on it. Wow!  I seriously cannot claim having been to any one restaurant over 100 times! So this place must be good if Mike O. Is such a loyal, regular costumer. He must roll out of bed and saunter right into Hana! Oh wait, this review is suppose to be about MY experience at Hana. Well, I have to concur with Mike O. This place serves some darn good food. Not just sushi, the cooked varieties too.  I've always liked eating here. Sushi is fresh, cooked items full of flavor.  I don't always check-in when I eat here but doesn't matter, I don't think anyone is about to take the dukedom away from Mike O. !

I like this particular Sweet Tomatoes for their location and interior décor.  It's big, spacious, modern and even with lots of people eating at the same time, the place doesn't feel crowded.   I love the 3 salads that they have as you first walk in then the abundant choices for build your own salad.   Since I am not eating carbs, I stay away from all the pasta salads, bread, etc. etc. but there are still plenty of choices for me. The only thing they lack are protein choices no ham, turkety, or even pepperoni slices.  You can purchase chicken breast meat in a separate container for an extra $3 I think but what I do is I just load up on their homemade chicken noodle soup and eat only the chicken chunks for my protein. If you are watching your waist line or counting calories, still make smart choices even at Sweet Tomatoes.  Load up on the veggies without salad dressing.  And ask how many calories are in one serving of soup.  Some of the caloric counts will shock you! When I see people in there eating with abandonment salads covered in heavy salad dressings and tons and tons of bread, deserts like pound cake and chocolate brownies I really want to shout:  do you really think you are eating healthy?!?!?! Sweet Tomatoes IS a place where you can eat healthy and eat with good flavor but only if you make good choices about what you put in your mouth!!!!

If you've never to this Sweet Tomato before, I will tell you that the interior is vast. You can go roller skating from one end to the other without any issues. Tonight per usual, we went down the line, paid, and was getting ready to look for a table to sit down to eat our dinner when the cashier said, "wait. You have to wait to be seated." At first, I thought she was uttering in foreign tongue cause I've been coming to this location for YEARS and we've never had to wait to be seated! Turns out, the place was fully booked. Full capacity- every booth and seat taken in the vast interior.  Very impressive. Easily I want to say over 250 people dining at the same time??? Way to go Sweet Tomato- you're doing something right!   I'm glad too- as I do enjoy the freshness and flavor of your soups and salads.  And I can't wait until when you bring your French Onion soup back again!!!!

Beautiful venue, love the architectural style of the building, love the location. Inside, it's bright and airy and the best part is despite the large number of people it can hold, there are no bad seats in the house. Anywhere you seat, you can get a good view of the stage. Keep this in mind if you are purchasing tickets and are on a budget. Even the least expensive seats are good seats! If you are here for a matinee show, pack a picnic lunch and go out to the patio area or stroll to the Tempe town lake, sit away, have your picnic and enjoy yourself!

When my brother who lives in NYC and is a foodie who doesn't think twice about spending hundreds of dollars for a good meal comes to visit me, I feel THE PRESSURE to take him to a restaurant that will stand par with those of NYC standards.   So he was in town and I took him to Roka Akor- beautiful interior, wonderful service, delicious food- what's there not to like? Unfortunately, the night that we were there, the place just was not croweded so it didn't have the NYC vibe of the "it" restaurant of a crowd of people waiting for a table.  In fact, when we drove into the parking lot, my brother asked me if the place was open. Which was too bad because I thought the food that we had was really good- we had some sashimi and some items from the robata grill- all wonderfully prepared and full of flavor.  Well presented. In the end, we had a great dinner and although my brother was not overly impressed, we had a great time talking about the preparation and presentation of our various dishes and we walked away satisfied customers.

Came here a couple nights ago to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Had their happy hour menu out in the patio area.  My friend and I split some dishes.  We had the soft shell crab sandwich, the beef sandwich, and the sea bass skewer from the robata grill.  All tiny portions for $5 . . . and that was fine with us since the quality and flavor of each dish was EXCELLENT.    We were very happy with our selections and talked about coming back to sample the rest of the dishes on the happy hour menu!

If you are willing to fork over the bucks for a custom cake, this is the place to come.  For my son's first birthday I had a custom birthday cake made here- over $135 for a half sheet cake, a smash cake, and a small 6" round cake.  Crazy prices, right?  Somehow worth every penny.  The cakes were gorgeous and just what I wanted to celebrate a milestone birthday for my son.   The owner was very nice and very proud of her products.  As apparent by all the happy customers who came to pick up their cakes. And of course, I have to mention as a side note the gorgeous, large cupcakes they served at Yelp in the Bloom.  Honestly, those were the hit of the event as everyone that had one in their hands, had that look of satisfaction in their eyes.  You know the look that I'm talking about- the look that says- I have the "it" item in my hands and I know it!

I have to tell you, after traveling through Southeast Asia eating a lot of noodles, dumplings, and all kinds of delicious food imaginable, I am on a mission to she'd some pounds so it was great that I was able to order their lobster lettuce cup and have it for dinner (minus the fried wonton chips and sauce) and have it be low calorie, delicious, full of flavor and filling!   My son had their hummus platter and needless to say, he also loved his dish!   All at happy hour prices. My bill came to less than $20. Gotta love that!

I just read some of the reviews posted about this restaurant and I am not sure that I agree with them.  Personally, I love coming to Kabuki.  The place is huge, airy, and well designed.  I love the mix of glass, red, and black contemporary decor. Each time I dine here, I have a good experience.  I love getting their chicken sukiyaki ($9.95)- the portion is so large that it's enough for 3 lunches.  I also love their Firecracker appetizer ($6.95)- tuna mixed with tomatoes served with deep fried eggroll chips.  Again, the portion is so generous, you can order this for lunch and being completely satisfied.   Their lunch overlaps their happ hour by an hour so you can have a late lunch and start enjoying happy hour priced drinks- can't beat this deal!   I also like their extensive menu- there is something for everyone.  My husband, who does not eat sushi, loves going there with me because he'll actually find an item on the menu that he likes to eat! I tried to make it to Kabuki everytime I am by the Tempe Marketplace- wish I lived closer to this restaurant!

Well, 3 years later I still love this place. I don't come here very often since I am not in the area that much. I'm sure if I lived close by I would frequent this place on a biweekly basis.  The good news is the owner has done a good job with the upkeep so the place still feels clean and new. The menu is still huge with an offering for every palate. My friend and I ordered 3 appetizers this time and it was plenty for the two of us. Like I've written before, if I lived closer, I would eat here more often!

Even this place is owned by the same owner who owns Stingray . . . can you say that quickly 3 times?? I love this place cause it has a much more casual vibe and service is always quick and good here. I love their happy hour menu with their $4 sake infusions.  I can get away with spending $12 for 3 rolls of sushi plus $4 for a sake infusion and be completely satisfied.  $16 . . . can't be beat!  My fav of the sake infusion is the pomegranate . . . so delicious and potent.  Be careful how much you drink because it tastes like juice with a full punch!! I also like taking my 5 yr. old here for their happy hour.  The waitress is always super friendly to him.  Fabulous!!

I've been to the Estate House before and actually did not stay for very long because the establishment just seemed a little too formal for my taste. I've changed my mind since attending the Yelp Mixer on Wed. night.  I don't know if it was the friendly Yelpers who were there to talk to everyone or just the right mix of people gathering at one point in time but I had a great time. The drinks were fabulous- I tried their pear concoction, their Strawberry Smash, and had a glass of champagne.  Champagne is my favorite drink of choice that goes without saying was good.  Both their pear concoction and Strawberry Smash had the right mix of alcohol and flavoring.  In fact, the Strawberry Smash is so delish, it's one of those drinks that you can have 5 of and think you are not getting drunk until you stand up and fall straight on your face! It was great to be out on the patio, met some great people, had some fun conversation.  One thing for sure, Yelpers know how to put on an event!

My husband and I went there during their progressive happy hour (50% off 5-6pm, 40% off 6-7pm, 30% off 7-8pm) where EVERY ITEM on the menu are discounted.  What a great deal!  We loved everything we had- especially the tuna taco- so much that we ordered that item twice!  It was topped with buck wheat soba noodles that has been infused in lemon so it was very zesty- delicious!  We enjoyed our dinner immensely.  The best part?  It was on a Saturday night!

If you are ever in a bad mood or is having a lousy day, come to this Whole Foods and I guarantee that by the time you walk out, you'll feel better and you don't even have to buy anything for the mood picker upper.  Yup, this store is just that great.  They've done everything right with this store.  I've also noticed that Whole Foods must be responding to the economy cause their price points for many of their items seem lower too.  Love this place!

Groan, moan, sigh. We came here on a Sat night and the restaurant was okay busy but extremely under staffed.  We were seated asked by one waitress what we wanted to order. When we said we needed more time to look at the menu, she promptly disappeared. I mean, literally. We never say her back in the dining room again.  There was one sushi chef and one waitress for the whole place. Tick tock, tick tock. It took over 30 mins to order and prob even longer to get our food.  The worst part was the waitress was pretty rude to us until she saw me check in on Yelp. Instantaneously she was much friendlier and nicer to us.  Pretty suspect! We still left her a decent tip cause anyone can have an off night . . . But not sure we will be back- the food?  Who can remember- we dozed off while waiting for it!

I have a love hate relationship with Bikram Yoga. The first 10 times I went to class I thought I was going to die and puke afterwards. And the smell of sweat and hot air was nauseating. Prob the hot heat baked my brain because despite hating it each time, I kept returning. I would return at different times during the day and figured out when the class was less crowded than others and through delirium, I started to feel the smell to be less nauseating, the room to be less hot and the poses easier.  Make an appt for me with a head shrink cause I actually started to look  forward to taking a class. And I actually got stretchier. Everything the brochure promised actually actualized.  Plus, the owners and instructors are so so nice at this particular studio.  No matter how zoned out I looked before or after a class, they always had a friendly  hello or goodbye for me.

If you read my last review, you know that I have a love/hate relationship with Bikram yoga. I mean, the heat, the crazy positions- madness!!!  The Arizona heat must have really affected my thinking capacity cause I actually started to miss this place. I mean, right, unbelievable!!! Yes, I'm back and I'm finding that I am loving the heat, the sweating, the viscous droplets of sweat pouring down my face blinding me so I can't see.  And ladies, don't lie- no one glistens in here. Everyone sweats and LOVE it!!! Haha. Really, they do.  I also loved seeing Nikki, Terri, Steve the wonderful instructors I remembered from the last time I came here on a regular basis.  The new instructors are super friendly too. There must be an unwritten cosmic law that you have to be a super cool, super awesome human being to work here cause seriously every time I walk in, they call me by my name and gives me a cheery hello.  And when I leave, after 90 mins in the heat, with my hair matted, disheveled, dripping wet with SWEAT and completely disoriented they still looked at me like I am the most beautiful human being perfectly put together and gives me a cheery goodbye. Can't get cooler than that.  A secret part of me thinks I've come back to this location to get a boost of the cheerfulness- right?  I mean I couldn't have came back for the madness of Bikram???

What?????  It's been almost 4 months and I have been coming here to practice the 26 postures in 105 degrees for 90 minutes almost daily and loving it?!?!  Yes, hard to believe- it's true.  Those of us who have never tried Bikram Yoga, just the mention of 105 degrees for 90 minutes sends us to fear.  Like me, before I came in one day and gave it a try and then keep at it for 5 days in a row.   Miraculously, once you commit to this Bikram as a daily practice, you find yourself loving the 26 postures, the 105 degrees, the passing of the 90 mins.  Seriously, I Yelp frankly.  I don't know if your body can detox through the sweat and the postures but that's what it feels like.  Coming to practice daily, my body feels more cleansed and lighter.  And I find myself judging myself less.  Each day I stare into the mirror and I give myself grace to not be perfect, to allow my body to be where it is at that moment.  And I begin to love the sacredness of the space created by my yoga mat.  It's beautiful.  It's serene.  It's unexpected.  The hardest part, really is getting yourself in to do the first class.  The second hardest part is to commit and come in for 5 days in a row.  Cause I won't lie, it is hard in the beginning to get use to the heat and the postures.  But if you preserver, your body adjusts and the room feels less hot.  You are less concerned with the heat because whatever is happening both your body and mind goes through a transformation.  It's calmer.  It's different every day- and it's okay.  That's the best part.  A good day, a bad day, it's all okay.  If you have been thinking about doing Bikram and hesitate, don't!  Just come in and give it a try.  This particular location is a good one to come as a first timer because every single instructor here is wonderful.  Warm, kind, and encouraging.  I've taken classes from all of them at various times and I love them all.    I also hear the same from other students.  Some of them drive from what I would consider far distance to come to this location.  Here are some practical tips:  for Bikram yoga, when you're buying a yoga mat, buy natural rubber and it's actually better if the thickness is between 3 - 5 cm thick.  Any thicker and you're wobbly with your postures.  At the beginning you will sweat more, learn not to be bother by it or wipe it off.  It's all good.  After consistent practice, you start thinking about it less.  It's nice to have a yoga towel but not necessarily- I used a large beach towel for many months but I did end up buying 3 yoga towels and I wash them daily and rotate them.  It is nicer with yoga towels- esp. the micro fiber kind.  Clothes made for Bikram yoga are super comfy.  They really just mold to your skin.  I practiced with regular sports bra and shorts for the longest time and recently bought clothes specifically for Bikram and now I'm converted!  Bring water- I ususally drink 40 oz in 90 mins.  Iced is nice.    And leave fear, worry, and judgment at the door.  There is just you, the mirror, and your breath.  So simple, it's all you need.  See you on the mat!!!

KidsPark and I have had a relationship for 2 years and the place has never let me down.  Can you say that about any babysitter or nanny you've ever had?!  Once, my husband and I forgot the closing time of KidsPark and they called us and stayed open for us until we got there.    When we got there, none of the staff complained and were as friendly and cordial with us as always.  I actually look forward to dropping off my son at KidsPark because I know when my son is there:  1.  regardless of who is on staff, each one of them are caring and friendly. 2.  instead of being plopped in front of the tv, the staff will do craft games or play games with the kids. 3.  the place is clean, stocked with great toys (and movies), bright and cheerful. 4.  they provide great, healthy snacks.  Great policies: 1. they charge by the minute~ seriously, they do.  And they never make you feel like you are not paying them enough . . . 2. great hours 3. reasonable rates  And the best part??    My son loves going there.  No tearful goodbyes and I feel secure that he is receiving positive, fun care!

After some of the hikes I've been doing, hiking Pinnacle Peak the other day with some girlfriend seemed like an easy stroll . . . almost. Still got a good workout in.  Could see bringing my 3 1/2 year old son here for a hike, could see myself hiking here on a daily basis. It's all good.  Well maintained trail, beautiful scenetic views, full facility.

Decided to stop in here and do a review before heading over to my networking event. Warm inviting place, delicious scents of the spices used in the dishes teases your appetite as you enter through the door.   Mom and pop restaurant, eat here to support local businesses. Hubby is going the way of vegetarian and vegan so I will definitely be back with him and my son to try out this restaurant!

If you have a baby or a toddler, this is the place to be.  As soon as the Museum opened, I got my family membership.  There were times when my son and I spend everyday (from ages 10months -3 years old) there before he started preschool and my son never got tired or bored with the place.  At times, he was able to spend HOURS in the same area and for moms out there, you know what a blessing that can be! The one most common complaint I've heard about the museum is the cost of entrance and cost of membership- most people think that it's a little on the pricey side.  I disagree.  Since I was there so much, I saw how much wear and tear the interactive activities goes through and how diligently the museum staff has been about replacing the parts so that each activity is always in perfect working order.  I also saw how quickly they replaced an activity if what they envision did not bear out in reality once the kids started playing with the activity.  And the place is HUGE!  3 floors filled with fun, creativity, and absolute joy.  The staff there is absolutely darling- so much patience for the little ones.  As often as I've been there, I've never seen a staff cross or annoyed with a child. FYI for those who think this museum is expensive- the Children's Museum in NYC cost  $10 per person and the place is less than 1/3 the size of ours.  PLUS their activities are not as creative or engaging.  Our Children's Museum in comparison is HEAVENLY!! I absolutely LOVE this place!

Where other stores in the same category has closed, REi has remained open and I hope they stay open and survive every cycle cause I just love this place. I love coming here to browse their products. I love buying their products and I love how once I'm a member, their generous return policy.  Funny enough. It's their generous return policy that has turned me into a loyal customer and someone who doesn't mind paying a higher price for a similar item I can buy elsewhere.

I'll be up front and write that I don't like to write reviews with low stars because I know no owner ever intentionally open a business intent on poor service and product.  Besides, life is too be happy and appreciative hence my top heavy star ratings.    So you know when I give a one star review, my experience must have been pretty darn awful.  The one saving grace was the student stylist, Brittany Darling~ she was amazing and has a bright future ahead of her.  But I can't handle facing ice queen Heidi during check in or check out or the ego ladden instructor Carrie who despite Brittany and I having a perfectly good time together kept interrupting to show her "authority" ever again.  I just can't take it!  Kohler Academy, 3 strikes and you're out!  I will not be back again as a client!!!!  Plus, if you haven't noted the economy, for a school offering student services, your prices are high compared to all the specials professional salons are offering these days.  Just glancing through the reviews, I can tell the reviews are spotty with more on the low rating side than the high.  If I was the owner, I would take notice . . .  wouldn't you?

What a difference a change of name and 3 years make!  When my friend and photographer extraordinaire Jessica Frieling started esthetician school here, I decided to come in and get facials from her to show support.  I noticed a difference when I called to make an appointment- the girl on the phone was extremely courteous and friendly and made making the appt easy.  The BIGGEST and most pleasant surprise was when I walked through their door and was greeted with a warm, friendly smile and a warm hello when I checked in!  In fact, the girl's smile and greeting was so genuine that I just had to give her a compliment right there on the spot!   I've always liked the interior of the academy and the spa side was on par with the hair side of the academy. All done in white and kept in beautiful, clean condition.  And the facial I got from Jessica Frieling was absolutely divine!!!  Mind you, I adore Jessica and thinks she is simply fabulous and I guarantee that you will too after you meet and have a facial with her. She took her time with me, used just the right products and afterwards, my skin felt baby bottom soft!!!!  I was so pleased with how my skin felt- thanks to Jessica!!!! She's also a fantastic photographer, hair stylist and makeup artist. I highly recommend her for all of them!!!! Call and make the appts quick- she works at the spa Thurs and Sat..  Ask for Jessica Frieling and get heavenly pampered. Do it quick- before she graduates!!!!

My husband and I stayed here recently for 3 nights.  I liked the beauty of the resort, the understated sense of elegance and luxury.  The size is fantastic, not gigantic and overwhelming.  The suites are spacious, gorgeous with lots of high tech convenience.  So for the facility I would rate Encore 5 stars. Unfortunately, the service I received while staying there truly left a sour taste in my mouth and I would not likely stay there again.  Why? 1.  At check-in, the woman working behind the counter neglected to inform us that we would be directly across from the XS lounge which starts blaring music from 10:30pm until 4am.  So even on the 19th floor, the music was disturbingly loud so that I couldn't sleep for the first 2 nights.  When I called down to the front desk to complain, they offered me ear plugs which I don't use.  If I had been informed about the noise from the XS lounge, I would have requested a room at the other side of the hotel. 2.  When we got to our room, we were relaxing on our bed and realized that the left side of the bed was completely saggy.  I called down to the front desk and instead of immediately telling me that they would switch my room or upgrade me, they said they would send housekeeping to change out the mattress.  WTH??  When housekeeping arrived, they said they could either put a board underneath the mattress or switch out the existing mattress for a new one. We chose to have a new mattress then had to leave our room for over 30 mins so that this could be done.  Major hassle. 3.  When we checked out, I spoke to the man working behind the counter and told him of the issues we had experienced during our stay.  I said that if the stay was perfect, I would not mind paying for the resort fee but as it was, I felt that it was a more than reasonable request to have the resort fee waived.  Esp. since I did not sign the agreement slip to pay for this fee during check-in.  The man would not agree to waive the resort fee and I asked to speak to the front desk manager. 4.  This is where my experience got even worse and left an even bigger bad taste in my mouth.  The front desk manager, Robert Cosko, did not agree to waive the resort fee.  Once again, I told him about the issues I had while staying at the Encore.  Without saying anything, he turned and went back to the back area of the front desk.  I waited at the front desk for 5~10 mins.  He came back and told me that there were no records that I had called about the mattress . . . like I was lying about this incident.  Which I didn't believe him anyway because I believe in a place like Wynn the would keep either phone or computer records of all conversations for liability concerns.  Then I had the sense that he was looking at me up and down, trying to gauge if I was a "valuable' guest ie~ big spender worth being nice to.  Obviously, he decided that I was not because once again, he stated that the resort fee could not be waived.  This really made me mad since as we all know, high rollers are comp for everything at a casino resort and different charges and fees are waived all the time.  Since I did not agree to this fee upon check-in and I did not use the services that emcompasses the resort fee, I am challenging this charge on my credit card.  I met Steve Wynn once when he came to my school to speak (U of Penn, Wharton) and I liked him and know that he is a hard working man.  And he has certainly accomplished a lot in his lifetime.  Unfortunately, while his staff is well trained, their interaction with me was not friendly and warm and did not make me feel like a pampered, welcome guest.  I believe in service and am willing to pay for it.  In this instance, I did not receive any worth writing about hence the 2 stars.

I really wanted to fall in love with this place.  It's located close to my house, I could bike there, it's got a great pool area.  But alas, Lifetime just did not live up to my standards. I joined and I did not go because well, there were just several things about this place that just bugged me. First of all, this place is just TOO big- no sense of intimacy- even with all the fancy granite tiles and nice carpeting- this place just made me want to come- get my workout done- and leave! The class offering were small so every class was packed- people were waiting in line to get in and aggressive about getting the necessary props for the classes.  And the spin classes were so aggressive- I want a good workout- not to start a head banging fight. The staff up front never seemed to know what was going on- every time I asked a question, I get a dull stare back. The locker rooms were dirty and most of the time wet.  It was disgusting to try to take a shower there after working out. And the swimming pool that I was so excited about for my son?  No umbrellas so you are at the mercy of the blazing hot Phoenix sun at all hours of the day. My son couldn't stand to be at the daycare facility either. So overall, there were some serious negatives for me.   There are twi good thing I will write about this place. One is that they have great machines for working out- every type of machines imaginable- all in excellent condition- so if you are into lifting weights then this is the place for you. One is that they do a great road ride every Tues and Thurs morningat at 5:30am and I've met some really nice riders.  Esp. Rick who is so passionate about riding, he's a total inspiration to me. The other is that they have great machines for working out- every type of machines imaginable- all in excellent condition- so if you are into lifting weights then this is the place for you.

This is one of 3 AMC theatres that shows IMAX 3D and it's pretty cool.  The sound at the IMAX movies are always so LOUD!  When I made that comment to one of the guys that work there, he told me that the sound is directly linked to IMAX corporate and by contract, they have to keep the volume at a certain level so I advise you to bring ear plugs which is what I am going to do next time! We saw the latest Superman here and I have to say the IMAX screen combined with the 3D was a pretty cool experience. There are certain movies that are worth the IMAX and 3D combo and Superman was one of those movies. The location is convenient off of the 101, there are lots of healthy "fast food" joints around the theatre for a bite to eat before the movie if you are inclined. Staff is friendly, comfortable seats.

I am bumping this place up to 4 stars because I just love the massages that Steve Ibach gives.  Seriously the best.  Got lured back with a special offer of free 90min Lomi Lomi massage with membership and I've been happy since being back.  The drive is still a bit far but it's worth it.  The other day, after I was done with my half marathon and I went in to see Steve and he totally gave me just the massage that I needed to get over my soreness.  And believe me, I was plenty sore!  Wow, I just glanced over and saw that Joe E. had the double Lomi Lomi massage . . . geez, that must be like going to heaven.  I'll have to get one of those one of these days!  Valentine's Day is coming up.  If you want your better half to be yours forever, I suggest getting them a membership to this place~ they'll love you . . . well, for at least a whole year before they start hinting that they want the membership for another year!

I generally get my Lomi Lomi with Steve Ibach. Steve was not available today so I had my Lomi Lomi with Jarid. And it was a great session! Jarid followed the notations from my file so knew how I liked to have my massage. I sensed that he was focused on giving me the best possible massage and there were times when I felt like I lost track of time and was floating, feeling relaxed. It was fantastic! I had told Jarid some issues I was having with my left knee and inner thigh and he incorporated some therapeutic massage along with the Lomi Lomi which was exactly what I needed. The room had the right music- and he will adjust the temp if you need it. The room was slightly chilly- still comfortable- I didn't want him to stop the Lomi Lomi to adjust the temperature! Hawaiian Experience Spa is a great day spa. There are snacks and tea for you to enjoy, cushy robes, sandals. Give yourself an hour after to take a leisurely shower in their opulent setup! The staff is always friendly. Now I have two favorite massage therapists there- Steve and Jarid!

An oasis in the midst of a busy city . . . I'm not sure how I first heard of this park but I'm glad I was in the area with my family and made a point to stop.  Giant pond where people sit and fish, read a book or simply meditate.  There are guided tours for birds and nature walks.  My son and I had a great time biking around the path that went around the pond.  Beautifully landscaped, a super way to enjoy an relaxing Sunday afternoon or anytime during the week if you are in the area!

I had been hearing about the glorious dining experience at Cafe Monarch for years but never made it there to have lunch or dinner.  Yesterday some friends came into town and I chose Cafe Monarch as an unique dining experience for them.  And we were not disappointed!  Everything was wonderful from the open air enclosed patio dining to the subtly lit candles that were used to light up the back patio area to

I used to get my Taiwanese food fix at the Taiwanese fast food place inside the Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.  But it's changed hands, the quality has gone down and it's never had a pleasant area for sitting down to eat.  I was happily surprised by Taiwan Food Express when I was at Mekong Plaza a couple of weeks ago.  My mouth started watering as soon as I read the menu and even though I just had lunch and I was full, I had to order the pig intestine with mustard greens soup.  Was it ever DELICIOUS!  Simple and true to taste.  I can't wait to try the rest of the items on the menu~ esp. oyster omelette!  I'm very happy that it's so close to my son's Chinese school because I have a feeling this is going to be a regular stop for us after class for dinner!

Talk to any Taiwanese person and you end up talking about food!  Any Asian person really, Asian people love to talk and to eat . . . is there anything better??!!  Came here again with my son and as I salivated over the menu, I couldn't wait to come here over a period of several wks to try the various dishes so in one seating I ordered:  oyster omelette deep friend chitterlings Taiwan style chitterlings noodle soup stir friend rice noodles Taiwan style taro smoothie w boboa and a mango smoothie   I wish I could write that I ordered all this food cause my son is a big eater . . . but alas, he's four . . . but, hmmm, me and my stomach really enjoyed all this food . . . everything was very tasty.  Don't worry, of course there were left overs which I took home for another meal . . . well, I'm not sure if the food lasted until the next day . . . I might have had them for a snack . . . tasty tasty!

I'm here for the second time within the week and this time I ordered the Taiwan styled stew noodles, green papaya salad, and iced coffee.  The Taiwan styled stew noodle was a bowl of egg noodle with scallions, bean sprout, and meat sauce. Simple and tasty.  The green papaya salad however was not good. The papaya too coarse and lacked flavor.  Portion also small for the price.  The upside to this experience is since I was here twice in one week I almost got a smile out of the person helping me at the counter.  And I've also decided that I'm going to try each dish on the menu that's not an Americanized Chinese dish.  So stay tuned for more updates!

Since I was in the area, I had to stop in for my Taiwanese food fix and I have to say even though the food is still good for what you can get in Phoenix, the format change to having wait service is terrible.   First of all, I've never really liked the service even when it was order & pay at the counter, now they have it as a sit down restaurant.   I changed my mind from having a large boba drink to a small and the girl behind the counter showed annoyance and asked if I will still purchase the large. Hmmmm, no- I want a small.   Then the waitress kept bumping my table trying to serve the table next door. She apologized the first time. Then the 2nd, 3rd, FOURTH time it was bump, bump, bump.   My bill was charged for the large drink- I asked for it to be changed to a small drink. That took a while. Then they didn't deduct the tax. I told my waitress and she lies to me straight in the face (this young 18 something) and tells me they don't charge tax on drinks because she didn't want to correct the bill.   Totally unprofessional.   Thumbs down.

With a name like America's Taco Shop, I had to check the place out.    Got the "homemade" ceviche and the carne asada taco.  Thought the prices were a bit high for the quality and amount of food that I received.  The ceviche and tortilla chips that came with it were a bit bland.  The carne asada taco was good but not spectacular.  What got me though as I sat indoors in their dining room was I started to notice how dusty everything was.  There was a grimy layer of dust over all the decorations on the walls and the tops of the condiment bottles were frankly disgusting like they had not been wiped in ages.  So I decided to check out their bathroom.  Sure enough, the ladder they had leaning against the wall had a layer of dust on them . . . .   and I felt a little grossed out . . . let's just say, if the public areas like the dining area and bathroom are not clean and well care for, I don't really want to imagine the condition in the kitchen . . .

I have to say, when I first heard that Montelucia was opening, I was really excited to try out the resort.  Been there several times now and I have to say that I am disappointed for such a gorgeous place in a picture perfect setting, the service is not better.  I regret to say the lack of attentive service that goes with the resort setting prevents me from going back there on a regular basis!

Is there a bicycle shop that's not staffed by cool dudes?    I'm telling you, all cool dudes work at bicycle shops and this one was no exception.  Came in here while training for the Tour de Tucson.    After riding some 70+ miles, I decided to stop in here for a bathroom stop.    While there, I started browsing and liking the vibe, decided to order a sandwich for lunch.    I think the sandwich was $7.95 . . . large portions with either soup or salad.  Full of flavor . . . just what I needed to refuel.  Plus, I got to eye candy some cool bicycle dudes . . . can't ask for more!

I was first introduced to Avalon by my artist friend Gary who helped designed the restaurant.  On my first visit with him, we had drinks and appetizers.  I remembered the drinks were great and what stuck in my mind was the ahi tuna on top of thinly sliced caramelized green apples.  The thinly sliced caramelized green apples added just enough sweetness and tartness to the ahi tuna to make this dish truly delicious and memorable. During this visit, I was introduced to the chef and owner Ryan and was impressed by their vision and passion for their restaurant. The second time I visited the restaurant was with my mom's club where everyone was really excited to try all the dishes on the menu.  So we each got a different entree and passed the plates around.  Everything we had was top rate and delicious.  What stuck in my mind from that visit was the lobster bisque.  Rich and creamy and full of flavor! I've heard they've added live music to certain nights- with the beautiful, contemporary interior, it's definitely a great place for date night so I can't wait to go back with my husband to enjoy the ambiance, music and of course the plate licking good food!

This place used to be called Mr. Sushi. It's been open as long as I've been in Phoneix so going on over 20 years now I am sure.   I'm not sure of the reason for the name change. The new name is difficult to pronounce and even harder to remember. I used to love the Mr. Sushi name- so easy to remember!  Regardless of the name, the place has the same feel and if think the same menu too.   For a reasonable price, you get generous portions of whatever it is that you've ordered. It's a guarantee that you will not leave hungry coming here for lunch or dinner.   I am glad the atmosphere of this place has stayed the same. Warm, friendly and inviting. It's like greeting an old friend when I walk through the doors after not being here for awhile.   Regardless of how many name reincarnations this place goes through, I hope they don't change the atmosphere of the restaurant and this place will always be Mr.  Sushi to me!

I frequent this strip mall often. Every time I walk in, the baristas are friendly. I don't really drink coffee- many times I've gone in just to get iced water then sat at one of their tables to use their wifi. Which by the way, the signal is very strong and always worked when I was there. They've consistently served me with a smile and friendliness and have never asked me to leave.   For my birthday, they happily serve me my free birthday drink.  The other day I finally ordered something and was .40 cents short cause honestly the day before I cleaned out myself making a charity donation.   Without blinking an eye and without asking for a reason, she covered me even though I most likely can qualify for "the regular customer that never orders anything."  With the frequency that I've been there, I've seen regular customers who unlike me, actually buys something and their drinks just get made to their liking without being asked and ordered.  They walk in, receive their drinks with a smile, pay and walk out.   I've seen the baristas chatting with the regular costumers like they are family.    Once, a customer started smoking at one of the outside tables and one of the baristas bravely told her Starbucks is strictly non smoking. I was doing the secret, silent fist pump over this one and wanted to go over and hug her!!!  With all this, how can anyone write that this Starbucks location is not the best one ever????

Located in a non descript mall, this beautiful shop should really be located by the Heard Museum or in the arts district in Old Town Scottsdale.  When you walk in, there is a very positive and warm energy to the place and the crystals and stones they carry are simply stunning.  My son liked going thru all the stones and crystals, admiring them all.  They carry high quality items including necklaces, meditation music, books, and of course crystals.  Very beautiful.

I love Apple products but I've finally decided I've had enough of their chaos when coming into the store.  Even when having made an appt online for the Genius Bar, the appts often run late.  And the check in process is a nightmare with one person with an iPad and long line while the lone person tries to find the person trying to check in.    I would much rather that once in the store, I can check in myself from the multiple of Apple computers that I can use and there is a number system like at the DMV where I see my number come up.  It's so much more efficient and time saving rather than waiting in line for one person to check me in then another person coming by to tell me that I will be served soon . . . wait another 15 mins.  It's 5:19 now- my appt is at 5:30- let's hope it's on time.  Much problems can be taken care of from home from your desktop- unfortunately for me today, when I tried to download the necessary items, my desktop did not have enough memory space so here I am, for the second day in a row.  This whole format might be the down fall of Apple.  I've been a loyal costumer since Apple first started- from the first beige box and I feel like I've had enough.

Everyone always comments about how expensive AJ's is and that's probably what they like to hear.  Frankly, I don't find AJ to be expensive, I love the place- all its various locations.  Everytime I walk into an AJ, I feel like I am walking into quality so I like to go (and take my son too!) to browse the aisles and take a look at their delectable offerings.   Then my son and I always stop by their deli and offerings of fresh food- we would sample their soups and get a small bowl for $3.99 and a salad from the salad bar for a good, healthy snack/ lunch for the two of us for less than $10.   Some days, I get a desert and share it with my son.  Other days, I order one of their delicious sandwiches for $7.99 that comes with a side and piece of chocolate, portioned enough for my son and I.  And I heard from a friend of mine who is a die hard AJ shopper that at one of the locations, there's all you can eat pasta bar on Thurs. nights for $7.99- never been but I've heard it's delish! So to me, AJ doesn't seem that expensive for the enjoyment of the store, the quality of the food, and the friendliness of the staff.

I came here because of the LivingSocial chocolate mani/pedi. I was scheduled with Laura and I LOVED her!  There are times when I go into a nail salon and when my nails are done, I looked at them and they are crazy sloppy like the nail tech had five drinks before working on my nails. Not with Laura. She took great care with my nails and by the time they were done, every nail was PERFECT!  I couldn't be happier when I

This is my favorite Costco location. I'm in here so often I think the employees recognize me as a regular. Lol. I know the layout of the store, the employees here are professional and friendly. They often joke with me as I check out. It's not as crowded as the Hayden location and just FYI, gas here is always cheaper than the Hayden location too- significantly lower. A little secret that I'm sharing with you!

Many people don't realize there is a campground within the McDowell Mtn Regional Park easily accessible from Phoenix and within the Fountain Hills city limits. Even my friends who camp often when I told them I was taking my son camping here, they give me a blank stare.  A hidden secret of fully supported tent and RV facility including super clean restrooms and showers right next to a playground, this is a perfect place to have a family jamboree or tent up to hike or mountain bike around the many trails that are right next to the campground.  The only downside is there are no shade or large trees on any of the tent sites so bring an EZ pop up to provide some shading or go camping in the fall months when weather is perfect here in Phoenix.

If you ever walk into H&M you know this place is always packed. And at times finding someone to help you is near impossible. While the styles can be cute and trend, sometimes the quality and sizing is hit or miss.  Well, this time I totally get lucky cause I was there buying clothes for my son (who is 8) and I snagged Rob (the world's most helpful and stylish sales associate) and when I asked him to help me pull together some good looking outfits for my son, he happily stopped everything he was doing and helped me for the next half hour or so and pulled together six of the best looking outfits for him!!! He even brought down all the clothes for me to the dressing room and helped me arrange the outfits for my son to try on. Honestly, I felt a bit giddy like I had the lottery I was so happy.  And yes, in case you're wondering I bought everything Rob pulled together for my son.  You go Rob for making me a happy customer!!!

Met a girlfriend there for lunch the other day.  Waited 5~10mins seated at table for my girlfriend to show up.  The whole time ignored by the waitresses.    Finally my girlfriend shows up, we order, our food arrives with no utensils on the table for us to eat with.  I had to practically shout down the waitress to bring us table settings.  All this would not have made me give this eatery a one star . . . the thing that really ticked me off was my girlfriend wanted to have shrimp in her dish.  Paid $2 extra on top of a $6.95 lunch special.  That's a 25% surcharge.  The dish comes and I look for the shrimp . . . THREE, that's right, THREE measly, little shrimps.    Those shrimps better have been organically raised and human fed for the price they charged.  I complained to the waitress.  Instead of taking the $2 off of our bill, she tells us she would take 5% off of the total bill which amounted to $0.60. Wow, that's a big deal . . . not.  Then she comes back and tells me that she can't do the % discount because the computer won't let her do that during lunch, only during dinner.  Really?!  What kind of B.S. is she feeding me??  Hint:  if you are working as a waitress, be honest and bend over backwards for your customers because they are the ones paying you, not the $2.50/hr. you get paid from the restaurant!  I was so mad over the whole incident that I actually did not tip my waitress and I usu. am a generous tipper.  Needless to say, Thai House has lost a couple of customers over $2.  Really, $2 for 3 shrimps.  Haven't they heard that times are bad and people want to feel like they are getting some value for their hard earned dollar?  And please, don't feed me some B.S. about the computer can only discount a bill during dinner!  TWO THUMBS DOWN!!

I actually have not ordered anything from here but I have to give it 5 stars for the sheer number of men that are there way early in the morning working on their laptops not dressed in shorts and t-shirts, slumming but actually hair combed and professionally dressed.  Is this the new trend now?  To get office dressed to work remotely from a coffee shop. A single woman's dream spot to casually hang out to meet a guy!  Lol. I'm not kidding.  If any of you single gals take my advice and start hanging out there (make sure you are also dapper and made up) after reading this review and snag a nice guy, well, I'm Chinese and love being a matchmaker so don't forget to send me a message with a little "wink" "wink". No need to share details.  I'm sure the coffee is good here for that kind of intel, read the other reviews.  Like I've already wrote, I didn't get any coffee or pastry there. And I'm sure the decor was nice but I didn't really notice. Nonetheless, thanks for the pick me up- the eye candy kind!!! XO

Hiked this little baby and when I reached the top, I felt like I accomplished something.  What a great feeling!  Constant elevation change going up then scrambling over boulders~ lunch never tasted so good when sitting on top of Flat Iron.   After lunch~ take the challenge and hike the additional 15 minutes and go all the way to the top! And don't forget to take in the breath taking scenery!!

Went to this place as part of my Tast of Old Town Scottsdale Tour and was immediately charmed by the establishment. Loved all the belly pots of olive oils and vinegars, loved Kelsey who gave us the samples, loved the atmosphere. Love places like this~ a bit unique, a bit of an experience.  Hard to leave this place without buying something so of course we did!

Do you ever have one of those moments when you walk into a shop and can't believe what you are seeing with your eyes? I took both of my bikes into this shop this past Mon for their seasonal tune up.  I'm talking to the owner Joe when I look down their counter and saw 2 cans of Rolling Rock sitting right in front of another customer.  I asked Joe if that was indeed beer and he said, "yes, would you like one?"  I looked at my watch, it was just after 12, technically in the afternoon now so I said, "sure, why not?" So I sat there and had a beer with them. What a hoot! Turns out this shop is not the kind of shop where you just go and drop off and pick up your bike for repair.  Customers actually go there just to hang out and shoot the breeze.  It's a community type of place.  Just kidding around, Ken the tech guy asked me to bring him some beer if he got my bikes tuned early and I said I would bring them each a can of Guiness . . . I got my bikes tuned the same day!  And true to my words, I brought each of them a can of Guiness when I went to pick up my bikes!  Don't know about the guys at the shop, but I sure had fun with them and left a happy customer!

I live in a pretty central location where there are many bicycle shops within a 5 mi radius. I have gone back to Joe & his shop several times because Joe is an on site owner- I like him & his effort in creating a community, his staff is laid back, cool & easy to talk to.   At one point, I had all of my bikes (all four of them) in the shop for either tuneup or repair and I've been happy with the fixes on all of them.   If you cycle a lot, you can get frustrated with the number of flats you can get, I finally got the gator tubes & they seem to be working.   I also love depending  on days of the week, you can find a live band playing outside. With offering of free beer or water, you can drop off your bike for repair or go in to browse for a new bike & at the same time get some relaxation in.   I love this place- I hope you go & check it out!

The party was so fun and amazing that I want to give it TEN stars. I MUST MUST give Lindsey and her Yelp team kudos and applause- this party was so big and had soooo many Yelpers that if the logistics were not planned out  perfectly, it could have been a real nightmare for the vendors and Yelpers alike.  Instead, Lindsey and her team made running such an enormous event look  easy and I kept overhearing what a great time everyone was having. It was so  well planned out spacing out the vendors that the event did not even feel crowded!!!!!  Fort McDowell was extremely generous to sponsor the location, the buses, the Tequila and Rum buses. There were food, alcohol, and entertainment vendors galore.  Once again, Wild Flower Bread Company came through with an excellent fitted t-shirt of good quality. I think they got their promo worth from me because I wear their t-shirts so often from this year and last year that people often ask if I work there. Lol.  For a list of vendors, please read the other informative and often hilarious Yelp reviews.  My review is all about kudos to Lindsey and her team for organizing such a FABULOUS event for vendors and Yelpers alike. Thank you Lindsey and her Yelp team!

Before I start writing my review, there are 2 things I want to share if you are a talent reading this or someone interested in getting into this business. 1.  I don't know how casting directors spend their "off" time but when they are casting, they are one of the hardest working people I know.  2.  If you get notice of audition, it means they think you have a chance of getting the booking- they've already spent their time & prescreened you so JUST SHOW UP & BE ON TIME!  Don't throw the opportunity away! Now to Good Faith- I first auditioned for Good Faith many, many years ago for an America's Best commercial (got a callback and almost booked) and during that audition the impression I had of Faith was she's a nice person and I haven't changed my mind since then.  I've auditioned for her more in years past and there has been times when I've felt like I totally flopped or was way too nervous cause those who know me knows I can sell ice to the Eskimos- but for whatever reason when I start thinking too much about the auditions, ping pong balls start bouncing in mind and I can be like a deer facing headlights. Which mind you, has nothing to do with the casting director.  Faith and Bella are great, they want you to succeed. So when you read this, and it reminds you of yourself, just know you're not alone in feeling nervous or whopped out.  There are some actors that are naturals and I've met a few of them. They naturally shine when recorded on camera.  I can shine too- I just need a bit of guidance. Which brings me to Faith's workshops. First and foremost, they are fun & informative. And Faith is FUNNY when she is teaching. She cracks me up!  Last year was a good year, I loved her workshops so much I took them all. (Here's a tip I will share with you- take as many workshops as you can with casting directors. Why?  Because when you know what/how they are it's easier and more relaxing to audition for them and when they know YOU, it's easier for them to know what roles suits you!) In fact, I kind of miss them so I will take them again I enjoyed them so much.  So if you get the chance, taking some workshops from Faith! Why am I being so candid when it's no secret that casting can be competitive?  Well, because I've been lucky enough to be on set a few times and it's a ton of fun.  It would be great if someone after they've read this, take a few workshops, do great at their audition, get booked and get on set!   The other thing about Faith's workshops is that they are practical. I don't want to write too much details- just take my word for it- you will learn something useful by the end of the workshop. Highly recommend! Oh, and I love Faith & Bella too. The way they interact w each other- what a dynamo team!  #goodfaithcasting #sscho47

Had a much needed massage after running a 5K turned into 15K.  That's right, I overslept and missed my 5K starting time and ended up running a 15K.  But we're not here to talk about my running, we're here to talk about my massage . . . by Michael.  Michael, when I first met him, appeared to be young and I didn't know how good his massage would be . . . didn't have to wait long to find out as his massage was heavenly. For someone who has an angelic smile, his hands are incredibly strong.  I felt like his hands were the hands of a body builder 7 feet tall.  I asked for medium pressure but I can assure you for those of you who like deep tissue massage, Michael is the therapist to ask for~ I can guarantee that you WILL BE SATISFIED!!!  I could tell he was just holding himself back from applying more pressure.   Alas, my hour was over too quickly and I wished for a longer session to massage the soreness of my legs away but I walked away a more pain free and relaxed client. Ask for Michael, you won't regret the request!!!

After reading some of the other reviews, I have to say thanks cause thanks to the reviews, I buy a service when Divine has the amazing deals for massages and facials for major discounts.  This last service I got was a facial and I think it only costed $20?  Whatever the amount, it was a very reasonable price.  Lucky for me too that when I went in, the esthetician was very knowledgeable and soothing in manner. So much so that I promptly fell into a deep sleep.  When the session was over, my skin felt baby soft and I felt very relaxed.  I also have to write that both times, the check in was prompt and friendly.  So far, both of my experiences have been excellent and I would come back here again.

My husband took my son to North Valley Gymnastics for a bday party.  Since then, he kept telling me how much more I would like North Vally Gymnastics than Arizona Sunrays.   Finally, today I took my son here for a trail class.  And I must write that I am impressed with the facility and the instructors.  The building and equipments are new.  The lobby is large and spacious.  The staff behind the counter greets you warmly.  The open area where all the gymnasts practice are open with fantastic ventilation.  There is a spacious open to below mezannine area where parents can sit and view their kids with comfort.  There is also another smaller area down the hallway where you can watch your kids too.  Overall, I'm very impressed.  I'm still loyal to Arizona Sunrays since the 2 years my son was there he's always had a good time with good instructors so I'm on the fence about switching . . . .  If you've never been here, it's definitely worth checking out!

*sniff* I can't believe I was made to cry (on the inside) no less on New Year's Eve. My hubby and I came here thinking we would split a burrito since I know how big the burritos can be at Chipotle.    We waited in line. I watched the two guys in front of me each get 2 tortillas each for their burrito and the girl behind the line really piled on the rice, beans, and their choice of meat. I was thinking, wow, these burritos are even bigger than what I remembered.   Then when it came my turn for my burrito, the girl behind the counter took one look at petite me and took out one tortilla and gave me a skimpy serving of rice, beans, and seriously like 5 pieces of meat. I felt so crest fallen.  I looked at the measly portion that was going to be my burrito, I looked at the girl behind the counter and asked why the two guys in front of me got such massive burritos but not me. She just rolled her eyes at me and went on to the next costumer.   Boy, was I disappointed. And I checked too with those two young guys in case they paid extra for their mega massive burritos. Nope, same price as what I paid.   I seriously wanted to take a photo of my burrito next to theirs cause mine would look like the runt of the litter. It was so pathetically so much smaller in size.   I thought maybe it was an off night but from reading the other reviews, many other customers have received the same uneven service.   Chipotle corporate, you should take note since as corporate you take such pride in providing a good product and service- that is the Chipotle brand and signature.   Well, this particular location is not making the grade.   And *sniff* now I know what being an unwanted stepchild feels like. *sniff*.

Ughhh, you know I hate to write negative reviews.   Let's just say the employees here could use a little, okay, a lot more training.  I handed my DD app to the cashier to redeem the offer and the guy looked confused and didn't know how to close out the transaction. Then when I went to drink my XL cup of coffee and the darn coffee spills ALL OVER my laps and chair!  Soooo glad I was not drinking this while sitting in my car~ I would have had a fit!   I went back to the counter to try to figure out what was defective with the cup and it turned out the rim of the XL cup was deformed (it looked old and all smashed in) when I pointed this out to the girl, she insisted that all the XL cups were the same.  Grrrr, it was pointless. I didn't want my morning ruined so I just asked her for another cup of hot coffee.  She doesn't pour me a fresh one, instead she just poured my spilled, left over coffee into another XL cup.   Shaking my head, I took my cup and left.  After all, it was NYE, no point in getting worked up about this.  I even wished her Happy New Year. Although, I will write, next time I'll remind myself to bring my own cup of coffee from somewhere else and not from here!!!

Small mom and pop operation.  Went here for a reflexology with Harold.  Very comfortable atmosphere.  As soon as I sat in the chair and was covered in towels, I promptly fell asleep which is always a good sign. And another good sign is the next day, I felt physically better, not just at my feet but overall sense of good health. Best 80 mins ever spent!

Beautiful salon, friendly staff.  Hair washing includes a nice arm and scalp massage.  Gotta love that.  Reina did a wonderful job with my haircut and style.  Super sweet, good listener.  Better yet~ good with her scissors and blow dryer!  In and out in an hour with a good cut and an easy good looking style.  Happy, happy!

I liked this place. It's locally owned and very small. Tables are squeezed in. When we were there it was busy and we were not in a hurry. Okay.   First we waited in line to order then we were told to sit down and someone will take our order. Okay.   Then we were forgotten. Oops!   I had to go back up to the counter to order. I was told to wait. Okay. Then she forgot me again. Finally she remembered me as I stood at the counter for another 10 mins (about 40 mins later) was not apologetic a bit brisk in fact. Okay.   Then I showed her my check in offer from Yelp and her mouth formed into a small "o".   After that, not surprisingly, service improved. Oops!  Too late!!!

When my friend invited me for a group outing to this place, I couldn't really understand the invite~ jumping on trampolines attached to the walls???  When I got there, I thought, "kudos to the human imagination"~ what a great place!  The place was packed from young to old alike, all having a great time.  I saw a couple of teenagers doing spiderman like moves.  It was just fabulous.  Me?  I had a fun kid-like time jumping around laughing.  Oh, and we got a game of dodgeball in too . . . I felt 10 years younger after I left the place from all the jumping and laughing.  You got to see it to believe it.  Go check it out!

Tonight I attended the Yelp mixer organized by Andrew- the rsvp showed 10 people but being the social Yelpers that we are, over 20 people ended up showing up to check out the Vig Uptown. My friends and I ordered the crab/artichoke dip, hummus dip, guacamole and salsa, and their chicken flat bread from their happy hour menu.  The food was excellent, everything morsel delicious. The manager came over several times to see if everything was fine which was great.  What fell short was the service provided by the waiter. He appeared to be completely overwhelmed by a party of twenty, showing up at various times.   I was there at 5pm and left around 6:30pm, in that span of time I had one drink.  I saw a drink floating by that looked interesting and managed to flag down the waiter.  He told me the Vig did not serve a drink that I was describing which I saw less than 10 mins prior to speaking to him . . . okay- but he did not ask me if I wanted another drink instead.  In the 1 1/2 hours that I was there, pretty much everyone had one order of drink even though quite a few of my fellow Yelpers were saying they would like another of their scrumpious alcoholic beverage.  I was there to eat and to drink- I probably would have had 3 drinks, for sure 2 if the waiter had been more on his toes. So no more than 2 stars for lack of service . . .

Normally, the cost for this tour is $42, there was a groupon for $25- the tour sounded interesting so a group of us bought the groupon.  We throughly enjoyed the tour and thought Annie Harris, a budding entrepreneur, did a funlicious and foodlicious job of organizing and leading the tour.  Annie hails from Santa Fe where walking tours were aplenty and when she moved to Scottsdale, she couldn't believe no such tours existed here.  Well, she didn't wait around for one to happen- she made it happen.  The tour is well organized.  Once you book the tour, she sends you a confirmation email with the meeting place and the best places for parking.  You show up, she hands you a bottle of water and a map of the walk tour that you will be taking.  We went to six different places:  The Rusty Spur, Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars, Su Vino Winery, Frank & Lupe's, Cowboy Ciao, and the Sugar Bowl.    At each restaurant, there were no delays in getting our sample since they were anticipating our arrival.  And I must say, the food/samples served were a good size and plenty tummy rubbing good!  Out of the 6 spots, 3 of the spots were new to me so I was glad to go there.  I esp. enjoyed the Rusty Spur, the Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars and plan on booking a party at the Su Vino Winery.  Annie takes us on a good, walking route with tibits of history between the restaurants~ I learned things about Scottsdale I didn't know before and I've been living here for over 10 years!  The only thing lacking was one of my friends did not eat beef or pork and all three restaurants (The Rusty Spur, Frank & Lupe's, and Cowboy Ciao) served either beef or pork so I wished there was a chicken option for my friend's sake and for others in the same position.  Would I pay $42 instead of the $25~ absolutely!  It was that enjoyable.

We came to this sanctuary because my son missed his rabbit Fufu from his old preschool and I remembered Faith from Good Faith Casting sending out emails telling us how much she loved this place.  I'm so glad I remembered and made the effort to come because Kelly is so wonderful and she truly loves all 74 of her bunnies. Plus I've learned so much about bunnies I never knew before! Here are facts about bunnies I never knew before (do you know these facts????): 1.  Bunnies like to have lots of space to move around thus all the contained space at the sanctuary are 4'x4' 2.  Bunnies are full of personalities and when they are in small cages as most of them are as home pets, they get depressed and will stop moving around.  3.  Bunnies don't like to be held. They like to get to know you thru time and once they like you, they will let you pet them.  4.  One bunny will bond strongly with another bunny and become bff's. 5. If there is a cardboard between 2 areas, the bunnies don't like each other and will fight! 6. When bunnies are in distress the cry they make sounds like a child crying! 7. Bunnies loves dried apples- it's their absolute favorite! 8.  They also like to chew on I think the wood is willow.  9.  They liked to be pet from the front of the face stroked back between the eyes and over their ears.  10.  They do not like high pitch noises.   I'll leave you with ten and if you want to learn more interesting facts, stop by the sanctuary and talk to Kelly.  She really really knows her bunnies!   It's truly interesting (oh no, the I love animal kingdom and I love learning facts side of me is coming out!)- truly I have learned so much about bunnies since coming here!  The sanctuary is nestled between shops in a nondescript strip mall which took me by surprise because, well, I don't know what I was expecting since the only other times I've seen rabbits are at a pet store.   When you walk in the space there is a retail area where you can buy gifts for the bunnies. The area where the bunnies are housed is after the retail area  and isbright and airy. Also very clean with cheerful decorations on the walls.   The best part is the bunnies seem happy. Frankly, this sanctuary is a MUCH MUCH place to adopt a bunny than buying a bunny from a pet store as these bunnies are MUCH MUCH better taken care of by Kelly and her business partner.   In fact, Kelly had told me the number one reason bunnies get abandoned is because most people don't understand bunnies and end up not properly taking care of them! Resulting in unhappy bunnies . . .   If you adopt from Kelly, I can guarantee you she will happily share her vast bunny knowledge with you to insure a mutual happy relationship!  The sanctuary also accepts sponsorships and volunteers.   My son started off sponsoring Ringo from money he earned and now he wants to go through the orientation so he can start volunteering there on a weekly basis.   I think this is a great way for a young child to learn the responsibilities of taking care of a pet.  And for us mamas and papas to spend some quality time with them.   Kelly has a very active Facebook page with over 20,000 followers so there are followers who sponsors the bunnies from all over the world which I think is fantastic.   My son and I truly enjoy coming here and we're looking forward to volunteering here and to learn more about bunnies. Truly amazzzzzing!  Truly ;)  #tranquilitytrail #sponsorship #volunteer #bunnies

Bunnies, bunnies how cute are thou? Especially after learning how each bunny really have their own personality!  And it's true- some love boys, some love kids, and some are divas!  So before you decide to adopt one, Tranquility Trail will have you volunteer at the sanctuary first where they will train you the proper way to care for your furry friend. When you do commit to adopt one bunny, you also have to adopt his bonded friend (although a few are bonified singles)- Tranquility Trail will provide to you FREE of charge a pen, 30 day supply of food and all the support you need to care for your bunnies. Incredible!  You also have to sign a contract agreeing to provide an excellent forever home.  With this kind of support and amazing kindness, adopting a bunny (ies) from here makes sooo much more sense than buying one from a pet store. Truly!!!

Bunnies, bunnies everywhere bunny. My son and I have started to volunteer here and not having grown up with pets I don't know who is more shy- me or the bunnies. I'm ecstatic to share though that I've gotten over my initial discomfort and petted a few of the bunnies!!!! Tranquility Trail is a very peaceful and low key place. The moment you open the door there is soft music playing and you can take your time cleaning out the bunny cages. My son and I like to talk and play with the bunnies while we clean and we also enjoy talking to the other regular volunteers there.  Bunnies really do have their own personalities as I'm learning. It would make a lot of sense but when most of the bunnies are kept in small cages, there isn't a lot of room to jump (get the pun?) for joy!   This is also a great place to teach litte ones about love and care in a non intimidating environment. And hands down the best place to adopt a bunny.  Yelp has incredible search engine mojo so I hope any time someone does a search for bunny info, my reviews on Tranquility Trail pops right up.  Oh, psst, Tranquility Trail is plenty busy on weekends with volunteers but could use some more volunteers during the week. I find it very relaxing in there. Have a couple of hours or two to spare, give Kelly a call and sign up for volunteer orientation!!!!

Last night I came out of a 3 hr meeting starving and did a nearby search for restaurants- China Magic Noodle House came up with 23 mins before closing!  As I was 5 mins away, I quickly got into my car and dashed over there!!!! When I got there, there were 2 other people in the restaurant and the waiter, understandably was telling them they could only order take out as it was so close to closing time.  Of course, I was crest fallen. I mean, I was STARVING!!!  It was a busy day- the last time I had something in my stomach was before noon- and now, I have to have take out and eat the noodles in a darkened parking lot inside my car?!?! What's a girl to do in a situation like this?  I pulled out my best sad puppy eyes and my best Chinese!!!!  And I asked them if I could PLEASE eat the noodle soup inside the restaurant. I think it was the Chinese that did the trick as they were surprised this banana spoke Chinese!!!! Ha!  You can bet this bowl of noodle soup was the best tasting one I had ever had!!!!! Oh so tasty and satisfying for my growling empty stomach!!!!! Yes, be impressed as I ate furiously away at my noodle soup while 3 people watched me, waiting to close. And I finished my bowl of lamb noodle soup, noodle style D in slurping 15 mins so I was belly full satisfied by 9:30pm closing time.  That's right, fastest noodle eating ever!!!! Thanks wait staff at China Magic Noodle House for having a little compassion for this (was) starving little 'ole me to let me eat in the restaurant when really, what you wanted after a long day of working was to close up shop and go home!!!!

Let me first clarify that I'm not a candy eater. For some reason I don't drool over candy or sweets. Despite this disclaimer, my mouth formed an "O" and my brain went into candy freeze when I walked through the door and saw the rows and rows of just candy, in all shapes, sizes, and flavors and yes, I felt giddy since unlike I was little were I was a child whose parents didn't ever buy me any candy, I was a grown up with my own credit card!   So despite the fact that I don't really like or eat candy, I shopped till my heart's content buying all kinds of candy~ little pieces, big bars, one in each flavor, candies I've wanted to try. It was simply fun to indulge myself. And who ended up the happiest in the world~ my hubby and son who of course got to enjoy the bounty of my purchase since they, needless to say, LOVE candy!!!!   This place is a hidden gem and a must go to for all candy lovers- grown up and kids alike!!!

In case anyone's wondering, it does help to Yelp!  Since my last review where I wrote that I would love a friendly hello when I go to America's Best for being a loyal costumer of 16 years or more, they've taken notice and since my review, I've gone to America's Best at least 3 times and each time I have received a friendly hello upon checkin at the registration counter!  What a difference that makes me feel- so much more welcomed!  And you know what, it does make a difference because I just bought their eye care plan for another 3 years!!!

I came here for an open house and while I have not taken classes here myself, from taking to the students who were taking classes there currently during the open house, everyone was very happy and satisfied with the guidance and instruction they were receiving.  The space itself is open with a clean, modern decor. The owner seemed very warm and kind.  Offers acting classes for both kids and adults.  I would definitely consider taking a class here!

I've been here twice now.  Once for happy hour where my girlfriend and I sat out on the patio and had wine along with an array of mouth watering tapas.  I remember the prices were so reasonable, we ended up ordering one of everything off the happy hour menu just to taste the tapas.  I think we were 95% happy with everything we tried. Last night I met a friend of mine there to watch flamenco dancing which they have on a stage on Thurs, Fri, and Sat. nights. I ordered a vodka and tonic and the bartender asked me as an afterthought if I wanted lime.  I said yes and he proceeded to bring me 3 in a glass cup.  But the limes looked old and dried up.  Small detail I know.  He shoulda thrown the lime slice in my drink then I would never have known! Then I asked for olives which he proceeded to bring to me wrapped up in a cocktail napkin . . . for such a nice place, I think he could have brought it to me in a glass! When the restaurant is nice, in a prime location, I expect the standards to be a little higher.  Tapas Papa Frita is not a dive bar! The other thing I was disappointed with was the stage was set off to the side by the bar area so if you were there to have dinner and to watch the show, you really can't unless you are sitting by the bar area.  In relation to the main dining area, I would say the stage is tucked away in the upper right corner and the performers are performing directly facing the bar. Nonetheless, I like Tapas Papa Frita and I would return again for the food, drinks, and atmosphere.

Yup, it's my 4th time having sushi in 4 days.  This time I took my son who is 4 and has already developed a taste for sushi just like his mama.  We ordered the tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi (6 pieces/ $10 each) and an order of chicken teriyaki ($12)  The sashimi came first and to my surprise, there were 10-12 pieces for each kind of sashimi!  We were delighted of course and still fought over the number of delicious slices of fish each one of us ate!  Then the chicken teriyaki came and to my surprise, it was a lean cut of chicken breast with very little sauce (which was just perfect for my low/ no carb diet!) with a big bowl of rice which was perfect for my son!  My son said, "Thanks mommy for taking me out to this supper dinner!" which sums up our meal.  Why not 5 stars, there was just one waitress for the whole restaurant and while she was very friendly, service was slow which can be hard for this mama with a hungry 4 year old in tow!

Came here on a Sat. afternoon for a 4 year old birthday party . . . can you say 'swanky' and 'cool'?!  The atmosphere there is the bomb! Apparently, for one set price per child, they will be unlimited refills of drinks and food for the party~ which is perfect if you have teenagers who don't blink twice at having 10 hot dogs!   We had a table laddened with hot dogs, fries, pizza, popcorn, potato chips~ talk about a kid's food heaven!   We were situated at the last lane which was perfect, the kids could run around safely while the adults lounged around and have adult conversation.  They have a full menu and full bar to satisfy any adult's appetite.  I took a tour of the place and became very excited by the vibe of the place (sleek, modern, new, clean . . . ) that I wanted to bring all of my friends here to have a good time that I texted a group of my friends right then and there about having a night out!  The waitresses were great~ very friendly and told me that on Friday and Saturday nights the a DJ comes and spins cool tunes~ she says the place gets packed so make sure to make reservations for a lane. (They have pool tables too.)  What a great addition to downtown Phx . . . would not be surprised if Tarantino shoots a scene at this lounge . . . this place is that cool.

I agree with Lindsey. I love the location, the concept but there is a something, something that is missing from the place that makes it a true vibrant urban hangout that it could be.  And that something, something could be the outdoor ice skating rink that is in Cityscape for the last two years. This year the rink was bigger and the day we went down to skate, the weather was perfect. There were people skating in a t-shirt and jeans at the end of December!  Only in Phoenix! For $10 it was unlimited ice skating, including skate rentals. The atmosphere was casual and festive. Chairs were provided for sitting if you were not skating. CVS was right there for use of public restrooms. You were also able to purchase snacks and drinks from CVS and bring them right to the rink for consumption My son Andrew had so much fun- he skated for 2 1/2 hrs. with min breaks. Being that he's 5 and this was his first experience, I would say he had an excellent and positive time! Having the rink there made the whole area feel so much more festive. It was great to see so many people gathered in an open, outdoor public place having a good time!

We come here every year during this time for ice skating because I think the whole setup reminds me of ice skating in NYC. I love the concept of ice skating in an urban setting.   This year, the rink is bigger and better. The check in and check out area even had its own separate shed. Very cool vibe. The price is now $12 instead of $10 but it's still unlimited and if you come during lunch time, it's only $6.   They've also changed the location. Now it's by the Palomar Hotel/ Blue Hound and Squid Ink which I think is a much better location. Easily accessible to good food and drinks!    Be warned!  The big people (ie teenagers and possibly drunken adults) start showing up at 8:30-9pm ish so if your little ones are out there skating without you, blow the whistle and round them in!  Otherwise, you might lose sight of them amidst the big people crowd!!!!

We came here after seeing Nutcracker at Symphony Hall & having a great dinner at Squid Ink. It was Sunday night 5pm and it was PACKED!!!  The rink as gotten fancier every progressing year. This year it had real railings with clear inserts plus a circular seating area in the middle. And the rink instead of being a simple square it's straight with some circular areas. It also has decorative arches now complete with stars.   Cost is $12 including skate rental and unlimited skating time. Which I think is still a great deal.   Who doesn't love skating outdoors in the beautiful Arizona weather with Christmas music playing?!  Apparently everyone since like I wrote in the beginning of the review, the place was packed. So packed that my 8 year old after 10 mins or so said he didn't want to skate cause it was hard to move.   Luckily, the skating rink gave me a free voucher to return. And he gave me a tip- come in the morning (early) for more relaxing, less crowded skating!

Came here for St. Patty's Day with a group of friends for St. Patty's Day.  The promo advertised free cotton candy, face painting, snow cone, balloons for the kids.  When we got there, ther were already a ton of kids there and all the families looke like they were having a good time.  There was a live band playing creating a lively atmosphere.  The area was enclosed so it was great to mingle with my friends while the kids played and ran around.  We were able to order food right from the outdoor grill.  And the food was served up promptly and quickly.  The 'family' portion of the party ended at 7pm so we left at 6:30pm.  When we left, the place was still plenty crowded and more people were still arriving.  West Addison advertised a fun time for all and they delivered~ we had so much fun!!

Loved the one down in Chandler~ came here with a group of 20 friends for a friendly game of dodge ball. Staff was friendly, the facility seemed new and of course, I had a good time~ hard not to have a good time when there's jumping and dodging involved. The only slight improvement could be the ventilation system as the first smell that greeted me made me feel like I had walked into a men's locker room after a heated basketball game . . . hate to write this, but the place smelled a little like old socks or smelly feet . . . the good news is that after you've been there a while, you stop noticing the smell.   So maybe the trick is to circulate some air fresher through the vents by the door?? I love the concept, the fun so this is just a little suggestion . . .

I've been here several times now and have loved everything I've tried. The pulled pork sandwich, the tempura friend string beans, the hummus sampler, grilled chicken and goat salad, the burger, the sweet potato toters, the wine- it's all been good.  The wait staff are very friendly and nice too.  Can't go wrong by coming here!

This place used to be the Notorious P.I.G. now it's called Hammered Hog BBQ Hall & Saloon and it's still owned by the same owner.    Had a Snag and Save e-gift certificate from when the place was still called the Notorious P.I.G.  By the time I was ready to use the e-gift certificate, SnagandSave.com was bought out by Buywithme.com and my SnagandSave purchases disappeared.  Luckily, I had print out the receipt and even though I did not have the actual e-gift certificate, the owner (who could have not honored the e-gift certificate 1. because I did not have the actual e-gift certificate 2. because the place was now called Hammered Hog BBQ Hall & Saloon, a completely different restaurant) honored my receipt and give me $30 worth of tasty bbq.  How coooooooolllllllll is that!?  An owner with a sense of integrity!!  I really hope this restaurant becomes a success just because the owner is so righteous.  Plus, the bbq was tasty too!

This place is the bomb.    The owners pulled out all the stops for a luxurious experience.  I love it when I go into a place that is so wonderfully designed, full of attentive staff that my mind goes into a cold freeze and I'm happy to pay $15 for a movie ticket plus $15 for 3 tiny little burger sliders.  I didn't care what the price was, I was so in love with the experience.  Now that's getting the customer hooked.  Saw Twilight Series, Breaking Dawn Part 1 here with 2 other girlfriends and all of us loved it here.  It was the perfect place to see Team Edward or you know, the other team, who?  Don't miss out, grab your gfriends or significant other and go check it out.  Perfect place for a date night.

Was suppose to meet my girlfriends for happy hour~ couldn't find the place and came here instead. Delightful surprise.  Comp salad and miso soup.  Nice on a rare cloudy and rainy day in Phoenx. Had the delectable sashimi salad.  Portion just right with plenty of sashimi (around 12 pieces) for $9.95.  Thought it would have been nicer if the salad portion was with variety of lettuce instead of just iceberg.  And would be nice if it had more flavour. Warm, friendly staff~ def would come back to try the other items on the menu!

The more often I come, the more I like this restaurant.  That's why I'm changing the rating for this restaurant from 4 stars to 5.  Each time I come here, I'm greeted right away by a warm smile from the waitress.  This just goes to show you, a warm smile goes a long way to make a costumer feel welcome.  I'm sure the waitress can't be having a good day everyday like the rest of us, but she still always manages to give her costumers a great smile.  I continue to like the comp salad and miso soup.  Always warmly received by me.    And I have to say, the sushi chef is clever.  Every time I've ordered their sashimi, it always comes with more slices than indicated on the menu.  The slices might be a bit thin, but as the costumer, I feel good because I feel like I'm getting just a bit more than what I ordered which makes me appreciate the place.  I agree with curious g.'s review that if the sashimi platter is dressed up a bit more with more varied vegetables, that would really bring the dish up a notch.  This last time my friend ordered the bebimbop and she said the dish was very good.  I hope this restaurant continues to improve and I hope the smiling waitress continues to work there.

I came here with a large group of people, there were 13 of us total. We originally were planning on going to True Food- it would have have been a 90 min wait there so that's how we ended up at Tanzy. Tanzy was able to seat us right away which was great!   The decor and ambience of the establishment is modern and upscale. But let's talk about what's really important-  the food!  My friend and I shared the lobster salad and pasta with mushrooms and were we glad we did cause the portions were quite generous!  By sharing, we were able to enjoy two different dishes at the just right portions.  The lobster salad was simply delicious with a very light dressing that gave just the right amount of flavoring to the dish. And there were plenty of lobster pieces in the salad too.  The pasta with mushroom dish was also delicious. I should be more honest- it was scrumlicious!!!!  Generally with this type of pasta dishes, there's usually a heavy sauce to give the pasta flavor or else the pasta is flavorless. Not with this dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly and cooked with just the right amount of sauce without it being heavy. I'm not sure how the chef got the flavor to stick to the pasta. Needless to say, I ate every last piece of pasta on my plate! I sneaked a peek at the other dishes, they all looked delicious and well presented.  Service was excellent. And they will split the shared dishes for you before bringing the entrees out to your table.  I went in there with no expectations and left a very happy costumer and am looking forward to going back to try out the other entrees!

I actually have not shopped inside the store. After reading everyone else's reviews, I will definitely stop in & browse after volunteering at the community garden.  I am here writing a review about my community garden volunteer experience.  What my son & I enjoyed most about the volunteer experience was that it was well organized and very little pressure to perform to a certain speed.  My son is 8 and the guy in charge had a ton of patience with him and gave him a task of trimming back the flowers and vegetation that were growing into the sidewalk so he felt very proud as he could immediately see the result of his efforts as soon as it was completed.  The task for that particular Sunday was to pick radishes and to wash them.  Then the volunteers were able to take the radishes home with us.  As a volunteer, you are also able to pick whatever you want out of the garden and take those home as well.    It was a very enjoyable way to spend a Sun morning and we will definitely be back again!!!

This is THE website to go to for EXCELLENT spa, all beauty needs deals.  DO check out this website before you book any appointments!  Lisa, the owner, is true to her words.  The couple of times that I had direct interactions with her, everything she said she would do was completed in a timely manner.    Plus, I love their Summer Spaaaah Series

I came here when some of my friends were shooting a film there and I went to visit them so I really didn't get to experience the actual bar and swimming party scene. From what I saw the place seemed cool. I was there on a Thurs night so it was not crowded but it was filled with beautiful people as my friends were filming and there were a lot of beautiful and good looking actors there. I liked the vibe there so I would go again for the swimming pool party and drinks with friends!

Arcadia Farm is a Phoenix standby, I moved here over 10 years ago, it was thriving then and it's still thriving. It's a ladies who lunch kind of place full of nutritious, delicious light lunch fares and a wait staff with extremely low turn over. It is not surprising to find a wait staff who has worked there for over ten years.  I used to go there often with clients when I had my architectural office but it's been years since I was there last.  When Lindsey organized a CMYE $3 donation (for a delicious baby cake) to St. Mary's Food Bank, I happily signed up.  There were 15 of us there and we were seated in a private back room with fresh flowers on the table, very nice.  The waitress was very friendly and bragged about the owner which is always a good sign when the staff is happy. My friend and I ordered the crab cake and grilled shrimp salad to share and although it took awhile for the food to arrive, it was delicious.  They also surprised us with complimentary hummus, pasta with grilled shrimp, and a desert tray. So really, we didn't have to order any food and we would have been plenty full! The generosity of the owner who I hope one day to have the pleasure to meet as she seems like the kind of wonderful lady I would enjoy sharing a conversation with, is apparent. And this stands to reason why after so many years when many restaurants have opened and closed, Arcadia Farm is still as successful and popular as ever.  I and Yelp thank you for a generous and enjoyable afternoon of lunching!

Wow, reading through the other reviews, I feel like I must live in a parallel universe because I LOVED, LOVED my experience at this place!   I had a craving for sushi and had a Groupon for this place so I grabbed my Groupon and came here for lunch. The Groupon was for $40 so I wasn't sure if it would be valid for lunch but the waitress told me that it was.  So I ordered their sushi/sashimi bento which came with miso soup, salad (with a delicious ginger dressing),  one each of tuna and salmon sashimi, one piece each of tuna and salmon sushi, 4 pieces of California roll, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura (with whole shrimps, not sliced in half then coated with batter), rice with generous portion of eel on top . . . Do you see how much space just listing the food is taking up?  All this for $13! Everything was fresh and well presented and while I should have only eaten half and taken the rest home for another meal, everything was so delectable that I finished it all!!!! The waitress was super friendly and nice. She showed no signs of being shocked that I consumed every morsel. And with the Groupon, I was able to order 2 orders of their sushi/sashimi lunch combo(at $13 each) to take home for dinner.  I would not have known about this place without Groupon now I'm planning on coming back here again! So if you ever go to this restaurant, I hope you experience my parallel universe as my experience was quite good.

This is my second time here this week. Last time I was here I wrote an update review but didn't post since I'm still learning the ins and outs of my iPhone. Fantastic place great friendly service. Last time I was here for lunch, a regular came in and the owner came out right away and warmly greeted her with a complimentary hot noodle soup of which he also gave me a bowl since I went over and started to talk to them.   So there are definite benefits of being a regular here. This restaurant is also locally owned so eat here and support local restaurants.   I'm here again for the second time this week having the sushi/sashimi deluxe with my son and I'm happy to write that this place is packed for Sunday night dining.   Family friendly, come on down and don't miss out!

I haven't been here in awhile ever since we have been going to Jasmine Tokyo but my friend and I were in the neighborhood so we stopped in for lunch. Happy to write that cozy, friendly feel is still there and the hour and a half we were there for lunch there was a lot of foot traffic of people coming and going for lunch.  They still have their Chinese menu, 40-50% off different rolls and all you can eat sushi for $24.95.  Still a great neighborhood spot and great for a quick lunch.  Of course . . . the only sushi place my son will ask for by name is Jasmine Tokyo . . . but I still like this place!

My husband and I came here for dinner before an event at Symphony Hall. The place is sparsely decorated but that didn't take away from the delicious dishes that were served. We had the Pad Thai and a vegetarian dish with tofu.  Well prepared and full of flavor. We also had the sweet rice with mango for desert which is a traditional favorite of mine.  It always helps when the waiter is cute too.  I remember thinking hmmm, his nice smile made the dinner more enjoyable.   So maybe if you're not all that into Thai food . . . you can go in for the eye candy?

Definitely ALTERNATIVE. Came here as part of an Yelp event and saw a free screening of Dale and Tucker vs. Evil. The genre is horror comedy and the movie was hilarious!  OMG, my hubby and I could not stop laughing throughout the movie along with everyone else in the theatre. The script was perfectly written and the actors perfectly casted. Def. 5 stars for the movie.  Also 5 stars for the space and the staff. Very cool, laid back feel, a space you can come hang out and people watch.  The theatre is intimate, with only 48 seats. Tickets at a little over $8 per show don't seem to be able to generate a lot of $$ so when you go see shows there, make sure you buy a lot of snacks to show support for this place cause it's such a cool place, I really hope it gets a following and becomes really popular.

You know how it is when you first try something new, there are all kinds of doubts whether or not you'll like the new venture. That's how I was.  My first class at CrossFit, I just didn't get it.  Self motivation?  What's that~ I need my personal trainer aka babysitter (just kidding).  There's none of that at this CrossFit.   After being there for a week, I started to understand the routine and WOD (work out of the day) and I found myself enjoying the classes.  I went daily and the great thing with CrossFit is that the WOD is different each day so you're never bored with the routine. Which is good cause it really does keep you on your toes.  Sometimes literally.   I also really liked the staff, esp. Vince cause he was a take no prisoner kind of coach. He will push you to your limit which is a good thing when you're working on getting fit. He is also very fit himself and has vast knowledge of the dynamics of the working body and nutrition.  He consistently is aware of how your body is moving and makes sure that your technique is correct. If you live in the area, this is a great place for you to train!

At first I didn't like this theater because it wasn't as upscale as the iPic but this all changed after I brought my young son, who is 6, here because I has an awakening that this theater was the PERFECT setting for parents to bring their kids to enjoy movie and dinner at the same time and being able to relax!!!!   The ticket pricing is extremely reasonable, the menu has a great selection of food prepared fresh. I love their kale salad and before I committed myself to working out, I loved their buffalo chicken wings as well. The grilled chicken tender with fresh vegetables is less that 300 calories for the entire order. That's what I'm ordering the next time I come here.  I LOVE, LOVE watching movies- it's also the perfect place to come have lunch and catch a movie whether you're with other girlfriends, significant other or alone. The atmosphere is receptive to all.  The seats are also very comfortable.  Yes, I've changed my mind. Now I LOVE this place!!!!

Once in awhile, I walk into a restaurant and it just as the "it" factor that makes me know I am going to have a good meal.  Inca's was such a place.  Despite being located in an area filled with chain restaurants and corporate offices, once inside and dining, the atmosphere feels more cosmopolitan that if you don't look out the window and see the massive parking lot filled with giant cars, you could be in East Village, NYC.  I went there today with two friends who also love good food and food always taste better when eaten in the company of other foodies, esp. if one of them is Peruvian and tell you in details the ingrediants of what you are eating.  After perusing the extensive menu, we ordered a pitcher of the  Chichas Morada which is noncarbonated juice made from purple corn cooked with pineapple and apple with a dash of cinnamon and sugar.  100% natural and so refreshing.    We started off our lunch with the Ceviche Mixto which is a fillet of white fish cut into slices, large shrimp, calamari, and red onion cooked by being marinated in Peruvian lime juice mixed with spices.  The portion was large, enough to share between the three of us and it was fresh and mouth watering delicious.  It also came with a piece of Peruvian corn with kernels so large (and I mean the size of a caramel) and meaty without being tough, something I had never had before and it was delicious!  From there we ordered the Papa Rellena which are potatoes stuffed with angus beef, anticuchos which are two skewers of grilled tenderloin cubes of beef heart, Ocopa de Camaron and that was delicious as well. It was all delicious!

Finally made it down to Cathy and Steve's Chandler location and I must gush about how easy the new location is to find! The new spa is spacious with 2 bathrooms, 2 (heavenly 7-headed) showers, 3 changing rooms with lockers, 2 saunas, a lounge area that overlooks the lake, great massage rooms for singles and couples, a room for facials. Of course the best part is the great variety of massages they offer. My personal favorite is the Lomi Lomi where getting the 90min treatment is a must since 60mins is just not long enough!  In fact, I got a 90min treatment a couple of days ago and it felt like it ended too quickly that I might just have to make reservations for a 120min treatment next time!! If you are looking for a special and unique massage experience, this is the place to come!!

Love the seaweed salad and octopus salad here- that's the reason why I come here! My son loves their miso soup, salmon sushi, tuna sushi, California roll, esp. their Mango sorbet. If I ever ask him where he wants to go for lunch, he always says, "Jasmine Tokyo"! This is our special place for lunch- if I didn't worry about our waistlines, this is where we would come weekly . . . If not daily.  Aside from a good selection of sushi, they also have a great selection of Chinese/ Asian cooked dishes, salads, desert.  We love this place- I hope they consider us regulars there!

This is the only restaurant my son asked to go to. He (and I) just love this place. The food is consistently fresh, with lots of variety even for a vegetarian.  My son goes for their tuna and salmon sushi, California roll, then their mango sorbet which is out of this world. We've been there so many times that now the staff greets us warmly and always make a point to talk to Andrew and I, which is really nice.  I'm really happy to write that the last few times we've been in, the place had been busy- which is really great cause if Jasmine Tokyo ever closed, my son and I will go there, stare into the doors forlornly. So peeps keep going to this delish place! Sushi, sashimi, rolls, tempura, veggies, Chinese food, oysters, shrimp cocktail, ice cream, desert galore, fruit, salad, seaweed salad- are you salivating yet?!  Head over there!!!

That's right, another update raving about Jasmine Tokyo. What can I say, we love this place. The owners don't know it but after 2 weeks out of the country, the first restaurant I wanted to go to when I got back to Phoenix was Jasmine Tokyo. I'm glad to see too that each time I've been there it's been crowded which is good since we love the place so it has to stay open otherwise we will be very sad!!!  Right now the parking lot is being repaved so the entrance is from the side but it is STILL OPEN!!!! Just enter from Starbuck's parking lot and you will have no issues. The quality of the food there is consistent, always fresh and tasty. The interior is clean and the staff so friendly!  By now they see me and they give me a warm hello which is always nice. Great variety!  What are you waiting for- hungry?  Go to Jasmine Tokyo!

Another update so recently after my last one~ that's because my son and I love this place so we can't have a holiday break without coming here to have a bite to eat and say hello to everyone that works there!    This time, I was happy to see there were plenty of LARGE groups coming in during lunch, parties of 10 or more.  This is something I've never written about in my previous reviews.  They have a large section by the side where they can accommodate large groups~ thirty or more if needed and desired!  There's also an enclosed "patio area" where I'm not sure if it's conditioned or not if you wanted to have a birthday party or a group party there for a "private room" feel as it is spacious and has its own door and entrances.    And it's fantastic to see them crowded as usual for lunch because I want them to have busy, busy business so they can continue to be my son's fav restaurant of choice!!! This time, we noted there was a new soup being offered~ coconut chicken soup, a new type of soup bowl, and in their hot entrée buffet area, they had cube steaks instead of steak slices.  Haha, you know we're regulars when we start noticing these small differences.  But THANK GOODNESS, they still had all our favorites of tuna and salmon sushi, California roll, and the can't be missed mango sorbet and coconut ice cream!!!  AGAIN, Jasmine Tokyo is OPEN during the repaving of their parking lots.  Just enter by the Starbucks for easy access.  Enjoy!  And happy holidays!!!

I've been racking my brain trying to think what is the highest compliment I can pay an eating establishment and well, I've decided it's a very satisfied "burp". Lol. It might not be very ladylike but hey, it's sincere! So here it is a "burp" and a satisfied smile for Jasmine Tokyo!

Yes, it was inevitable, after watching me checking in so many times on Yelp and talking about Yelp, this time while we were at Jasmine Tokyo, my son took my iPhone, checked us in then started to write a review for our favorite joint. Kids are so tech savvy these days, instead of typing which would have taken him forever being that he's seven, he pushed the Siri button and dictated his review. His review was, "this place has the best sushi ever" then he took photos and posted them.  He's now an unofficial junior Yelper!!!! And of course we still love Jasmine Tokyo!!!! This time though I was not in the mood to eat heavy and had a lot of veggies and salads instead. Out of curiosity, we counted how many VEGETARIAN dishes they served and we counted 18 vegetarian dishes ranging from the salad bar to cooked veggies to the vegetarian rolls.  I've been telling you guys this place has something something for everyone. Not just those who dig sushi.  I seriously love coming here!

I know this is an all you can eat sushi buffet.  An unknown secret is, they also have a ton of vegetarian options and frankly, a lot tastier than a salad bar. Seriously, the last time I counted, I think I counted over 30 options for a vegetarian. Surprisingly, that's what I find myself gravitating toward the last few times I've been there. I love their mixed vegetable with tofu, their 2 different kinds of seaweed salad, the snow peas, braised spinach salad- yum yum so good!   I just love coming here for their cleanliness and bright interior. I find that there are so many varieties here that I don't have to try everything at once- I can come back 2 days in a row and it's plenty fine!   I've got this down to a science where even though I'm at a buffet, I dine like I'm at a sit down. If you go during a weekend lunch, they serve raw oysters and cocktail shrimps. I prepare myself a delish plate of 8 raw oysters and shrimp cocktails. After that I have a plate of seaweed salad, veggies and salad. Small portions of course, artfully arranged. Then I have my sushi with a bowl of soup. Then desert- always my favorite- coconut ice cream. Dining in this fashion, I create a very nice 4 course meal for myself! We've been here so much, we chat with the hostess, with the bus boy, with the staff.  And it's great that Andrew can pick and choose what he wants to it.  We often come here for a 2 hour lunch! Can't get better than this!

Another update for Jasmine Tokyo cause well, we simply love this place.  The thing about all you can eat sushi buffet places is sometimes if you come a lot, you can get tired of the food as the sampling are the same day in and day out, 365 days out of the year. Yet there are such abundant choices here and cooked so well that you don't have to taste everything at once!  You can one day decide to eat sushi, one day go vegetarian, one day Chinese, one day just salad, one day the grill, one day the udons and even one day just desert!!!! And yes, I love the warm greetings from the servers, hostess and always, my son eats plenty and always leaves happy!!!

I don't know how many reviews I've written for Jasmine Tokyo. I keep updating my reviews because we keep coming back!   However many years they have been open is however long we've been going.   To tell you how great the staff there is and I hope they read my reviews, once my son and I went to eat, he was soooo tired, after he got his food, he basically fell asleep at the booth while I ate. The waitress was so kind, she did not charge me for him not eating his food. Then we went and ran errands and he was soooo upset that he didn't get to have lunch at his favorite restaurant, we had to go back there for dinner- and I don't remember what happened- it seems like with kids things unexpected can happen, they came to the rescue AGAIN!!!!  Not only is this restaurant my son's favorite restaurant, it's become my favorite too since the staff is so great.   We've been coming here to ear for many years- aside from the sushi, I really look forward to their vegetarian selections. I think this place is better than many of the salad bars out there. Not only do they have a great, fresh salad bar, they have over 20 selections of vegetarian dishes to choose from. All delicious and freshly made.   I love, LOVE, L.O.V.E. this place and I'm happy to write that each time we've been there, it's packed with happy customers!!!

Met a girlfriend here for lunch. Was on a 10 day detox so my choices for food were limited but I was not worried coming to a place like this. I knew regardless of my food restrictions even if I was the world's pickiest eater, I was in good hands.  My girlfriend ordered their ahi tuna salad and I ordered their chopped salad with no dressing. Basically a bowl of variety of chopped veggies, raw, nothing else added. The salad came with feta and as I was not doing feta as part of the cleanse, I explained this to the waiter. With a smile, he whisks it away and promptly comes back with a salad with no feta.  Although my girlfriend doubtfully asked if the salad was tasty with no dressing, no feta, nada nada except for a bowl of delightfully fresh veggies, the salad was indeed extremely flavorful with the mix of beet, corm, and bounty of other goodness.    The key is freshness and Grassroots had plenty of it! I wish most people would realize that with the right combinations of greens and vegetables, the flavors of just the natural goodness packs plenty of flavor. No dressing needed. No feta or any cheese needed. It's a cleansing of the palate and the body.  I digress. Okay, Grassroots was everything I expected. Even though it was my first time here, I just knew their menu and service would be excellent and I was not disappointed!!!

This year instead of running the half, I rode my bike in their 20 mi bike tour- what a great way to spend the morning!  The ride was mostly flat, extremely well organized and enjoyable. In addition to the bike tour, half, and full, they've added a mini marathon which is 5.4 miles.  I was ohhhh, so impressed by their logistics of getting everyone in and out. Have to confirm but I would say there were easily 10,000 that day.  Pretty soon, this event is going to turn into the PF Chang Rock n Roll NATION!

While my son and I are represented by another agency (FORD- see my Yelp review on FORD also), I still wanted to write a review of AMAM and Gail for those of you who are interested in seeking legitimate agencies and is doing a search on the Internet.  AMAM is a SAG boutique agency and Gail's background is in marketing so out of all the agencies in town, she is the most active in social media with presence on Facebook, twitter, Pinterest. And she actively puts together marketing material for her agency to showcase her talents.  Several of my acting friends are signed with her and they are happy with her representation so by word of mouth, she's a good agent.  My son and I had the opportunity to spend quite a few hours with her once and from that meeting I can write that I really like her as a person.  So if you are seeking representation, AMAM would be a good agency.

This place is super fun especially if you have little kids to make having sushi an experience.  My son loves to sit at the countertop area and watch all the different sushi go by then pick what he wants to eat. The good thing too is the fact that the portions are smaller so if you're a kid you can try a varieties of dishes to discover what you like to eat and as the parent, you're not breaking the bank as your kid is embarking on this culinary adventure. My son has a great time here.  He will ask to come here and happily for me, each time he'll pick up his favorites like salmon sushi and California roll but he will also pick out one or two new dishes to try. It's great to come here during happy hour which is when I try to go as both my son and I can get fill up on sushi for around $12 for the two of us. I can't imagine this happening anywhere else. The staff is friendly.  Always with a smile and prompt with service.

The latte I had was good.  My friend's fruit smoothie was a little too sweet. The atmosphere is good, has a welcoming feel. The chairs and tables are comfortable.  Pretty typical coffee/smoothie place.  Not so memorable and not so forgettable either.

I waited for awhile to write a review for this location since I was not sure how I would feel about a no frills gym after being members at the Village and JCC.  After several months of working out here, I have to write that I surprisingly really like this place. I started coming here cause a friend of mine raved about Kathy Cole as a trainer so I signed to train with her. I must write that I really like training with Kathy. She is very consistent, always on time and very committed to her clients. She doesn't write anything down cause she knows exactly what you need. Each time the workout is different (perfect!) and if you want to work your muscles hard, she will give you want you ask for!!!  A lot of figure and fitness competitors train with her. She also holds weekly posing classes at this location for competitions. If you train with her, the posing classes are free otherwise there is a fee to attend. What a great perk!!! I also really like this Fitness 1 (don't know about other locations) cause the staff and trainers are super friendly and nice. It's a nice vibe to be part of when I'm working out.  All different types of people work out here from casual weekenders to a lot as in mucho serious body builders who compete on a regular basis. I like coming here and seeing the serious competitors working out. It's inspirational to me. I see them and I think hmmm, I can do it too.  I love that!!! If you are looking for a gym and live in the area, you will not regret joining this place. Seriously. Sign up- get going now!

I met John at the Yelp Western Adventure event back in March.  Anyone Yelp gets to be an event photographer you know they are yeelllppping cooool!!  John handled hundreds of requests from Yelpers asking him to take their photos that night and he always answered with enthusiasm and a smile.  A photographer that can handle masses of Yelpers indulging themselves on copious amounts of free flowing alcohol tells me whaat a greeeaaaattt guy he is!

After you read my review, you might be laughing so hard and pee in your pants.  Not kidding.  My son and I decided to come here after volunteering at Tranquility Trail Sanctuary and it was at the Sakura parking lot that I realized I had left my purse/wallet back at the sanctuary.  Luckily, I had my iPhone so I was able to pull up the Groupon we were going to use for this meal. But I didn't know if Groupon would be enough to cover the meal so you guessed it, I was digging in the seats and pulling out all the emergency bills and pennies.  I went into the restaurant cause my son was hungry and looking forward to the sushi and I did not want to disappoint him. What can I say, I'm a bit of a softie.  So I asked the waitress what the Groupon covered and my dilemma and not surprisingly because there are so many cool and nice people in the world, the waitress said don't worry about it.  The chick was the bomb!  Full of understanding and general good vibes.  Thanks to her, my son who is 8 happily ordered what he wanted (I did not eat I felt so mortified) and even though I did not have enough money to give this  waitress a tip and promised to come back the next day to give her a tip, she graciously told me it was not necessary and still happily served us.  It was really incredible. Unfortunately, I was so mortified about not being able to leave her a tip that I did not remember to note her name to give her credit here.  In case the management is reading this review, she had long, black hair with bangs. Know what a great person you have working for you!  XO

Unlike the real Cleopatra who swooned her subjects with her beauty and majestic presence, this Cleopatra is a plain Jane from the exterior.  It's in a non-descript strip mall next to Winco and from the exterior, it looks like a sad, forgotten bar.  And we were a little confused by their hours of operation from 3pm-midnight. Luckily, this Cleopatra is anything but plain Jane when you walk thru the front door.  It's by no means fancy.  Instead, I felt like minutes before I was in Phoenix, AZ and now I am in another country, more specifically Turkey. The interior of the restaurant is what I imagine a restaurant in Turkey would be set up.  To the left, big seating area with couches for those communal pipes and drinking of coffee and tea by men.  To the right, lots of table and chairs with numbers on them for what I assume is for karoke singing and dancing as to the right side back there is a band setup, karoke machine, and a dance floor. The best surprise, which every restaurant strives for and what costumers to write about is that the FOOD was delicious, excellent, and mouth watering yum, yum! We ordered the Cleopatra salad, spinach pie, falafel, lamb chops and chicken kabob. The salad dressing on the salad had just the right amount of herbs and tanginess that it opened up our appetite.  My son devoured the chicken kabob and asked if we could get the recipe from the restaurant.  My husband and I loved the spinach pie, falafel, and I loved the lamb chops.  The lamp chops were perfectly grilled.  And the falafels were possibly the best I've ever had.  Slightly crispy on the outside but oh so delicate, moist and flaky on the inside. Throughout our dinner, we commented that we were soooo happy to have come here, what a pleasant surprise the food was as from the exterior, we did not expect much and how we would definitely return again as good Mediterranean food is hard to find in the Valley. So Cleopatra, thanks for a wonderful dining experience and see you soon again!

I had HH here with Irene V., Anna M., and Dave H.- they all had the oysters and loved it. I had their arugula sausage pizza and also loved it. Anna M. loved her orange vodka drink as did the others. I had water and was not given the side slay glare- in fact the bar tender was very nice and kept my water glass full. Seems like a popular after work business people crowd.  Love the location a bit out of my hood but worth the drive for the HH and to hang & chat with some of my Yelp friends!

My friend was raving about their menu so after a late night out on the town, we got there at 1:05am and unfortunately the kitchen closed at 1am.  We didn't make a big fuss cause well, it was 1am in the morning, we were not going to make anyone cook for us so late/early in the day! So my friend and I both had a cocktail each~ he had the manhattan martini and I had some drink for which I cannot remember but they were both well presented and delicious~ full of subtle flavor! The name Pig & Pickle is so deceiving since if I heard the name without coming to the joint, I would expect a hole in the wall BBQ place.  But I see from the many reviews this place has already received, the word is out that this place is a foodie heaven and a cool place to hang out. I will be back again, this time before the 1am gong hour so that I can try out their menu along with more of their delicious, libacious cocktails!

We know the FOX is clever, the restaurant concepts they come up with are like little magical yellow bricks down the yellow brick road that is lead by the Peter Piper and when one opens, people gather. I love the concept of the Yard, group seating, plenty of games to play . . . and there were plenty of groups there.   Now I know FOX is deft and any restaurant is all about maximizing the potential for the almighty drinks and serving of food.   Unfortunately, at the Yard, service of food and drinks failed miserably.  There were a large group of us Elite Yelpers there with our friends celebrating some Dec. birthdays . . . yet, there weren't enough seating and I seriously stood there for almost 2 hours and not ONCE did a waiter come by and ask me if I wanted anything to eat or drink.  And I was more than ready to order something to eat and drink!!! All those potential loss of revenue I saw all around me.  I'm thinking, "if they would do the order and deliver system differently, the nightly intake would certainly double if not more!" I don't know what the solution is, but if I were FOX, I would send someone FOXY and brainy to spend some time to analyze the situation and come up with a procedure where the plentiful patrons are serviced because at the end of the day, you are still running a restaurant and not a free playground for the grownups.

I have to write this place was a total surprise to me in terms of its service and quality of food. Here we were, at Sun City West where the blue hair crowd was driving golf carts on the streets to get around.  Understandably then, my expectation to find a tasty Thai restaurant was low.  Imagine my raised eye brows when we opened the door to a pleasantly decorated and clean interior. Most importantly, the smell of the Thai food was mouth watering delicious!!! The place was crowded and everyone's plate looked fantastic that before I sat down, I became excited to eat there.  We ended up ordering the green curry and it was creamy, rich, full of flavor and out of this world!!! I promptly forgot my no rice rule and mixed the green curry with my rice and it was soooo good!!!! If you are ever in the area and are looking for a place to eat, this place is highly recommended!!!!  Yum, finger licking, bowl licking clean good!  Yup, it's that good!!!!

Yes!!!! I have a twin here in Phoenix by the name of Brenda or is it Susan?! Reason is cause I come here many times and sometimes more than once in a day!  Hence my alias cause I don't want the guys in there working to know that I'm addicted to their confections!  Yummmmm, I just love everything they have to offer here.  When I would go back to Taiwan, the first place I always go to is a shaved ice place to satisfy my shave ice fantasies!!  Now I don't have to fly to Taiwan for the same delectables- hey, what I would have spent on a plane tkt, I can spend on shaved ice at this place! I tend to shy away from the Americanized flavors like strawberry and go for flavors like taro, Thai ice tea, green tea, mango, and original milk flavor. Oh wait, I think I just listed ALL the ice flavors as my favorite. Haha. I'm not surprised.  I also love all the toppings mochi ball, mango, yum yum I say.  Please the drizzles- love both the black seasame and condensed milk! Oh, and don't go for the small- go for the LARGE like I do and ask for it on a plate- they'll give you two flavors and two types drizzles and two types of toppings. Get the picture?  HEAVEN on a plate!!!!! I love the vibe of the place, hype and modern.  And the guys who work there too- they play along with me when I give them my aliases- I have to love them for that!

Holy hot chocolate they weren't kidding when they say to come early for parking. I had read Jennifer H.'s review but I guess I really didn't get what she meant when she said the cars were backed up to the 101. I exited at 7am from 101 and it took me 45 mins to the race grounds and park. By then, the 5K was already over! After taking almost 2 hours to get to the race, I was not going to leave without running so I ended up running the 15K instead! The parking is definitely an issue I have never been in a race where it took so long to park. I'm not sure what can be done to improve in this area for next year.  Otherwise, the race was very well organized from packet pickup to day of the race. There were a ton of port o johns and volunteers handing out Gatorade and water at the aid stations. I loved hoodie, hot chocolate, and fondue. All were of extremely high quality.  The only other thing I was disappointed about was the finisher mug. On the website it looked like it was ceramic but the actual finisher mug is made from thin, cheap plastic. Almost disposable. In fact, that's where a lot of the finisher mug ended up- in the trash can after the goodies were consumed. I brought mine home but it looks so cheap I don't know if I will display it.  Overall, a very enjoyable way to spend the morning. I don't know if I will do this race again due to the parking issue~ but it is a fun race!

I had a photo shoot done here with Scott Hays Photography and also took an acting class here with Linda Waymire. The space is well designed and bright in a great location. Susan the photographer who holds the lease is extremely nice. She specializes in pet photography. As a space it's wonderful. As my experiences here in this space is with Linda Waymire and Scott Hays Photography, I will be reviewing them under separate and their own individual reviews.

Tracy is my salvation.  I work out with this man 3 x's a week and I love every minute of it.  Tracy is a pro body builder himself so whether you want strength training to lose weight, gain some muscle tone or seriously train for a body building competition, he will have the right program for you! As a testament to Tracy, I've lost 20 lbs in the last 9 weeks by combining his training with clean eating and just 30 mins of cardio a day.  Needless to say, my clothes are fitting better and I feel great! I've had other personal trainers before with very little results.  I like the fact that Tracy took me seriously when I told him my weight loss goals and my strength training goals and he cares about me and achieving results.  He varies up the routine when he sees the need so each time I train with him, it's not the same, boring drill.  And I can see my body changing before my eyes!   There are days, like everyone else, when I don't want to work out but I always show up and leave feeling more energized and more positive feeling about myself because of the encouragement Tracy gives me.  I love hearing him say, "Good job!" when I finish a set!  Giving Tracy a 5 star rating is not enough, I would gladly rate him 10 stars!!!!!  For the month of Feb., if you mention Yelp and my name Su-shien C., he will give you a special discount on rate.  So don't wait to get the body and level of energy that you want~ call him today!!!!!

Finally made it here with a bunch of friends for HH. While the HH items were abundant and well priced, I opted for the hamachi sashimi, California roll and free edamame with Yelp check in. Which was plenty of food for this girls.  We had a table of about 20 people. The gal who organized the gathering was a regular so we got prompt and fantastic service.  I would not say the price is the cheapest but the quality of the food is worth the price tag.  There is an outside patio where you can sit to people watch those milling around Desert Ridge.  Pleasant decor and atmosphere. Everything from the sushi to the rolls to the cooked food items looked delicious- will be back again!!!!

I think having the festival at Hance Park was a good move. I loved the vibe. It almost felt like Central Park. There were no bad seats in the house.  Thanks to Michele M. We were seated in the VIP section- there was an open bar, lunch, dinner, free flowing snacks.  There was also valet parking and lounge chairs already set up so it was great that we didn't have to bring anything.  It was also set up so we could easily walk over to the general admissions area to visit all the vendor booths.  I also noticed in the general admissions area they had set up free water stations and also free sunscreen which I thought was very considerate.  Even without the VIP treatment, the concert would have been very fun to attend as the general admissions area were filled with people on blankets just enjoying themselves, there were plenty of food and trinket vendors and there were no bad views.  I hope they decide to have the festival at Hance Park again!

I can see why this place has gotten so many good reviews. As soon as you walk in, the place feels bright, airy, and super friendly. The menu is not extensive just enough variety and everything looked good and healthy, including the kid's menu.  Their signature dish is their coconut fish taco and for $10.99, it's big- one taco per plate piled high with coconut shreds, fish, mango, and cole slaw. One order is enough for 2 average eater.  My son got the grilled chicken breast with fries (the other choice was brown rice) and it's a 6 oz. piece of chicken so plenty for a 8 year old.  All orders come with a drink.   It's self serve but when we were there it was not busy so the server got us the utensils, ketchup, etc. so that was super nice.  Hmmm, I think my son charmed her. Haha.  We'll be back again- if only to sit at the cool surfboard tables!

Did someone say sushi?!  Oh wait, that's my daily craving!  It was New Year Day and guess what I wanted to have for dinner to ring in the Mew Year?  you guessed it, sushi!  Originally, I was going to go to another sushi joint which I will not name here cause I don't want to start a sushi rivalry but the other joint was closed on New Year Day.   As it turns out, it was a blessing in disguise since Squid Ink is located right next to the ice skating rink so we were able to have dinner then walk right over to go skating- so convenient!  We had quite a feast.  Chicken teriyaki bowl for my son, chicken teriyaki noodle for his friend, edamame, shisito peppers, 3 California rolls, 1 spicy Salmon roll, miso cod.  Oh, did you think the rolls were for me?    Of course not!  My growing boy ate his chicken teriyaki bowl then proceeded to eat the California rolls and the spicy salmon roll. After some gentle reminders, I did get a few pieces from each of the different rolls.   It's a good thing when my son heartily eats (since for a young'n, he has a pretty good palate) and we are fighting,hmm I mean sharing happily our sushi!  Michele M. who also joined us for dinner ordered gyoza, fried tofu, California roll, fried shrimp tempura roll also enjoyed her selections.   My fav out of them all was the miso cod. 4 thin slices, perfectly cooked so the cod was still tender and moist. Hmmm, just thinking about it makes me what to have it again.  Service is amicable. Staff friendly. Glad to have come here- and will come again!

I really appreciate being able to find authentic flavors for Chinese food when in Chandler. I found this place based on Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed!  The place is not fancy- but it is bright, cheery, and clean and DEFINITELY locally owned. Gotta love that! The owner was very friendly and personable. I told her I drank a lot of water and she promptly left me a whole pitcher to replenish myself- which of course makes me very happy! Now to the food- the menu has a good selection between American Chinese and authentic Chinese food. They also have a special Hong Kong menu which I think I will try when I'm in the area.  I ordered the Hong Kong style beef brisket curry and I was not disappointed!  Just the right creaminess with a hint of cocunut milk- with huge chunks of beef brisket. Portion size plenty for two people to share. It was down right delicious.  I wish there were more people eating with me so I could have ordered more dishes to share and sample.  If you live in the area and you're Asian or love authentic Asian food, this is a hidden gem!

This buffet has since changed its name from Lin's to New York Seafood Buffet. Same owner, new chef, and I think better food.  I'm glad I did not read any of the reviews before coming here because otherwise I think I would have missed a wonderful dining experience.  As you know, most Chinese buffet places are not that clean and I was surprised by how clean, well decorated, spacious the restaurant was.  Everything just felt clean. This in itself should deserve 5 stars!!! The choices were abundant. Most of the food was fresh. We came on the tail end of the lunch crowd so some of the items like the egg custard tart and Seasame balls were a bit dried from being under the heat lamp for too long. And some of the food like the miso soup and beef & broccoli were a bit flavorless.  On the positive side, the sushi was plentiful and fresh, with not too much rice underneath. And they did have chicken feet and braised pig's feet.  Overall, enjoyable and deserving of my 4 star rating!!!

The first thing I think of when someone tells me there's a Vietnamese restaurant I think hmmm, is the place going to be clean? since a lot of the Vietnamese restaurants around town are dives.   To my surprise, this restaurant not only newly opened, is open, spacious, CLEAN and well decorated in a modern theme.   The menu is extensive with the basic pho choice of rice noodles or egg noodles.  I decided to try their shrimp paste, pork chop, Vietnamese meat loaf over rice plate and a drink consisting of condensed milk, raw egg, and club soda.   I was a bit queasy to try the drink but wanted something different~ as it turned out, the drink is tasty~ a bit like liquid custard.  I think it would taste even better with a bit of salt sprinkled in to enhance the flavor.  I have to laugh though since none of the other wait staff, including the owner has tried this drink even though it's on the menu! The rice plate was good.  Everything tasty.  Only bit of turn off was the pork chop came out really greasy.  Had a layer of oil on both sides that I had to sop off with a couple of napkins. The wait staff were friendly, so friendly in fact that they waved and hollered out good bye to me without giving me the check.  Lol.  Good thing I'm a honest customer and told them I had not paid yet!   Overall, a very enjoyable experience.  Good location~ I hope they do well!!!

What?! Zumba energy in a painting class???? That's exactly what we got when instructor Kelly jumped on the stage and started started to guide us through our painting.  When her instructions were completed, she would crank up some cool tune.  I was ready (and did) bust some moves between brush strokes!!!! I love these easy to follow step by step painting classes not so step by step that each painting is the same but easy enough to follow for the painting to be done in an hour.  I found myself enjoying the time with my friend and relaxing as I painted. Most of all, I enjoyed the instructor, Kelly's enthusiasm and energy that brought a lot of FUN to the session.  Whoever hired her is a genius- what a hoot of an instructor!!!!

I really like this place. At first I was a little confused about the concept . . . I could choose my price and select as many toppings as I wanted for one price?!  It seemed too good to be true~ just to test them I went to town and selected 5 different toppings. The good stuff too like caramelized onions, grill chicken breast, some delicious hot peppers, portobello mushroom, ham on a wheat crust and sure enough it was around $10. Unbelievable!  My son had their ham and pineapple on white crust and he loved his pie!  The serve was quick and friendly and I loved the smell of freshly baked chocolate cookies. I saw them on many people's orders~ who can resist?!  This is a great place to come for casual dinners especially for families with picky eaters. You can make your own pie, just the way you like it without breaking the bank!  As mentioned in several of the other reviews, their HH is incredible. I haven't been here during HH but I'm looking forward to giving it a try!

What?!  Nom, nom, nom. You talking to me?  What's that?  I came in here for a quick bite to eat during HH- no drinks and a chicken chopped salad w no dressing to keep it healthy?  What?  I'm still eating healthy- Tito's (vodka & tonic) has the lowest calories and carb if you're going to have a drink. No, really.  What? This short rib bruschetta right in front of me full of delicate port reduction on top of a bed of mushroom purée?  Well, I'm getting my protein in. And the fried risotto rice ball that's rich and creamy with just the right hint of mozzarella in the center?  The waitress told the they were one calorie each.  What?  I'm not hoarding my chunks of blue cheese and dipping them in my hard to resist blue cheese dressing. Hey, keep your fingers away from them! That's how it goes sometimes, I go in to eat a simple meal and the menu looks so delectable that I have to just "order a few more" just for tasting.  Good thing I had a few of my Elite Yelper friends with me to *sigh* share in the burden of tasting as we were in there celebrating Irene V.'s ROTD. And good thing as we ordered our way through the HH menu, the portions are the same as during regular hours but at about half the price cause I think by the time we were done, we might have ordered one of each item! Be warned!

The atmosphere is nice. Located right next to the lake.  Dog friendly establishment.  My friends bought their pumpkin spice latte, I got their Americano. They liked their latte. I thought my Americano had a rich, coffee taste- it was good.   Free refills on the Americanos & the server was nice and gave my friends a free refill too.   Will be there again for coffee & our morning walk!

First time visiting Dre'sat their new location and I'm happy to share that their new location is super easy to find right off of Scottsdale Rd and Greenway Hayden Loop. The space is twice as big and just as beautiful as their last space. The owner Andre has visions of making the interior into an amazing vibrant space- I can't wait to see the finished transformation!   This time my appt was with Tyler James.  Let me tell you, can he color, cut, and style hair!  We got talking and it becomes apparent to be that this man loves hair~ in fact, he's passionate about hair and loves to make his clients feel sexy, gorgeous, and beautiful!  We decided on an all over color for my hair and I LOVED my hair when it was done. Shiny and soft looking just perfect to compliment my skin tone.  Don't let his young looks fool you, he's been doing hair as soon as he learned to walk and baby, the scissors were like an extension of fingers working on my head! I loved my experience with him and will be back again! Smart of Andre to add Tyler to his Dre's team. If you decide to book an appt. with Tyler, let him know that I sent you!!!

Sooo we're here after my son's disastrous haircut at the OTHER place that I shall not mention. I had to tell him repeatedly that Tyler was a fab stylist.  Skeptical but having no choice since I controlled the wheels (LOL), we came to Dre's and when my son saw the beautiful salon, he sang a different tune and became excited to get his haircut.  The haircut took less than 30 mins which is what you want when cutting the hair of a 7 yr old. And let me tell you "wowza" what a world a difference a vava-boom haircut makes!   I'm my son's mom so I know I'm already biased (I admit it) but after his haircut, my son's cuteness meter went up 5 notches. Seriously dripping adorable! And of course Tyler made it look so easy cause he's just that goooood! Who says boys can't have style!   All the moms out there, if Tyler can make a boy's hair styling, think about what his cut & style will do for you precious little princesses, yourself and yes, your husbands!!!! Love! #style #fab #love

When Marisa S. asked me if I wanted to join her for a wine tasting here at first I thought it would be a place like Bevmo or Total Wine based on their name Wine WAREHOUSE.  Much to my surprise and pleasure, it's a boutique wine shop with friendly staff. For more details on what's offered read some of the other reviews already posted.  I will write the ambience is great- perfect place to bring a date or come with a group of friends. Great location with a beautiful patio out front with seating.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff- sure to become a neighborhood favorite!

I've actually been back to Outback several times since the Yelp's Outback Adventure thanks to the fantastic experience I had while here at this event. I looked forward to this event since Outback while having great food has a relaxing atmosphere so I knew I could come and hang out with my fellow Yelpers without worries for formality.   I sat with Irene V., Bao H. and sampled the new bar menu in a leisurely pace.  I tried two of their cocktails which were full of flavor and I loved how they were served in mason jars for that backyard, down under feel.   All of the bar menu items I had were good.  I have to sing praise to the steak on top of the fries though as my favorite.  It's full of calories I'm sure so come have this on your cheat day and it'll still give you your protein while satisfying your carb cravings. The other menu items I liked were those little stuffed mushrooms and fried coconut shrimps.  Nom, nom.  Yum, yum.   Definitely a great place to come for happy hour to relax with a group of friends or if you just want to take a break from shopping or a busy day. Best part?  Their happy hour bar menu is ALL DAY LONG!  Starting from when they open to when they close . . . how much better can it get than this?! Thanks Lindsey, Yelp, and Outback for hosting this fun event!

I just love coming here. If you follow my reviews, you know how I am. If the vibe is right, I don't care what the price is. And that's how it is here. Every time I come, I love sitting out in the patio, enjoy my time in the sun (or not- as this time, the sun is blazing and of course the staff is considerate enough to move the umbrella so we are in full shade) and enjoy watching the traffic drive by. This time my friend had the spinach apple salad and I had the bison goat cheese salad.  The portion was just right, both were delicious esp the salad dressing for the spinach apple salad! The owners of LGO somehow has the magic 8 ball dailed into the right frequency to create an ever lasting environment each time. When I am sitting out on the patio enjoying my food and drinks, I feel transported to a space and time that is of the moment not connected to any human created contraption such as the clock. For the duration, there is just enjoyment.

I hover between 3 1/2 stars to 4 stars for this place only because well, prob because I'm Chinese and while I appreciate the decor, atmosphere, and service here the food just seemed a bit tad expensive for what you get.  I mean dumpling with kim chee is a good combination but I don't remember what the price point was. I just remember bear with it- it's the place. I mean for the price, I want a big platter of dumplings and a whole jar of kim chee- not the three or four dumplings that we got!  Same thing with the ramen. I was like, how much for the bowl of noodles??? Okay, okay, I am sure I've been spoiled by Japan town in LA or actual ramens in Japan.  Admittedly, I did enjoy the atmosphere and decor. I think it's a good place to take a date or for a business meeting. And the food is good even if the portions are small.  I guess when I get my Asian on, I want to be belly full with left overs to go!

This is my first time writing a review for a food truck. I think it's kinda cool since food trucks are mobile I would think they would not be able to be listed for writing reviews- yet here they are on Yelp!  Can I just say, "Yum!"  Let me first declare that I generally don't have a sweet tooth but this delectable concoctions just looked too mouth watering to pass up!  I was at the Unexpected Art Gallery grand opening downtown when I noticed several of the fellow festival goers had these mounds of ice cream on top of a waffle and it just looked yummy!  After seeing waffle creation after waffle creation I couldn't resist anymore and I bought one that was waffle smeared with Nutella with about a pint of vanilla ice cream on top with a piece of chocolate & the girl was nice enough to also give me 2 scoops of freshly made whipped cream.   I prob could have eaten this whole creation myself- I shared with 2 other friends and it was still plenty for us.   And I can write that I didn't indulge- sort of.

I went to the grand opening at the invitation of Anna M. and Irene V. but they had to twist my arm . . . just kidding!!!  I already knew this new location will be hip, trendy, and fabulous since I am already very familiar with their downtown location so when they invited me, I happily complied.   I was not disappointed!  The new location has these great glass doors that completely opens out to the patio area making for fantastic people watching. And the menu is the same delectable food items. And of course their famous cocktails always serves to please.   Great addition to Old Town Scottsdale. Looking forward to their many years of thriving business here!!!

I still love Hula's!  Came here for a celebration and the food & drinks are still good. This time I had the fish balls, pot sticker & egg roll filled with seafood. They were all delicious!  I had hot tea tonight. I liked how they brought over a selection of hot tea for me to choose & also brought over an extra pot of hot water in case I wanted refills.  The atmosphere & wait staff are consistently friendly and warm.  The place was thriving & hopping even with the rain outside & on a Sunday evening.  This is a good sign that it's a favorite spot for many!

What I noticed right away when walking into any Nekter location is the delightful smell of freshly juiced fruits and vegetables. I love the smell!  I also love the baskets of fresh fruits and vegetables . . . it took me a couple of visits to realize the baskets of fresh fruits and vegetables were in fact realistically fake!!!  They look real enough to eat!!!  The menu is simple and straight forward. And I appreciate that they list the calories of each juice and smoothie so you can make the right choices.   I've had 3 or 4 of their juices/ smoothies and they are all refreshing and tasty.  Anyone who has gone here has told me how much they love their juices/ smoothies.   As for the wait. Be GLAD for the wait- cause then you know you are getting the real product and not some type of syrup that they are calling real juicing. If you have ever done juicing or made smoothies from scratch before (like I have)- you KNOW each serving takes a while to make!!!  As for the price?  When you juice or make fresh smoothies on your own, you come to realize even one made at home cost $3-4 dollars by the time you add up the cost of all the fresh fruit/ vegetables and other ingredients!!!  I love Nekter- I hope they are successful and stay around for the long duration!

I came here with a group of lady friends.  Most of us had their lunch special which is for $5 you get a slice of their gourmet pizza and choice of either Caesar or mixed salad.  The salad comes on it's separate plate and the pizza is a big, generous slice.   Both were very good. I loved the crust of the pizza. Nice and chewy. Baked in one of those big, wood pizza ovens. Excellent on the first day, fresh out of the oven. Forget your carb count & just eat it all cause it will not be hard & not tasty at all the next day.   Why 4 stars and not 5?  Our waitress seemed a bit surly. It seemed like she was the only one serving in the whole restaurant so she was needed everywhere at once. I didn't mind it too much since I know how that can be from my college days working as a server myself.   Check in and you get an order of garlic knots which are pipping hot and garlicky delicious!   I would come here again, the salad and pizza are good!

Apparently, when it's rainy and cold (hovering around 50F) Phoenicians do not venture out to the trails because I had the WHOLE park to myself- not another soul in sight except for the ranger who greeted me then promptly went into his office.   At first I hesitated to venture onto the trail as an urbanite, I was a bit awed by the silence of being in the vast preserve as the only person out in the open.   Then I told myself I had driven all this way in the rain, whole time not knowing if I would hike to just walk for ten minutes and turn around so my driving in getting there was not wasted.   I bundled up in my down jacket, gloves, and hat- put on my headphones w my Tibetan meditation music and just started walking on the well groomed, wide trail with no expectations.   And you know what?  It was divine, it was heavenly, it was purity to just walk with no need to make conversation or to hurry to keep pace with a group. And it was cold and lightly raining but after awhile, I warmed up and forgot about the light rain.   The surrounding was serene and peaceful that I felt so grateful for the preserve. I said my thank you to the people who created the preserve. It was simply a perfect existence.   I followed the trail and decided to hike to Brown's Summit and really the whole trail is easy. In fact this is a perfect beginner trail for someone who want to try trail running. Even the ascent to the summit is not bad.   There was a moment of mysticism when I was sitting at the summit taking in the view. It started to rain harder and then the whole summit got covered in clouds. I could see the clouds coming and forming. It was so thick for a bit that I could not see the hand in front of me. In all my years of living in Phoenix, this was the first time for me to experience something like this- so much like Yellow mountain in China.   It was so calming, so centering to be there at that moment.   Then I started my hike back to my car- it was so cold, my iphone froze and that was fine too. I hiked in silence. Again, no expectations.   What a fantastic preserve. There are quite a few affluent homes in the area, I hope they take the time to hike & enjoy this treasure.

Who are these Foxes?  I'm in love with them and their design/ concept team. I want to meet them, hang out with them & talk shop, design, beauty & food!  I'm putting it out there- anytime you all have a party, invite me and I'll be there!!! Walking into Flower Child is like walking into freshness. Immediately I felt refreshed and recharged. Everything is done just right from the vibe of the place down to the rust spots on the farm "chandeliers."  It's the kind of place aside from having amazing conversation, if out of space, you can throw a blanket on the floor, start a picnic on the floor with your entrees and still feel right at home.  And the food!  The menu is organic, gluten free, vegan with options of chicken & steak for protein. And everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. It's nourishment for the eye, soul & body.  I had their chicken, roasted vegetables, and cream corn with quinoa & kale and each bite was a morsel of a delicate kiss to my body & soul.  I don't think you will have any regrets ordering anything from the menu.  The BEST part I have to exclaim to the WORLD is that their kid's menu unlike so many other establishments that serve terrible food like chicken tenders, Mac & cheese, etc. they serve the same wholesome, delicious food to the mini me's.  It's wonderful, absolutely wonderful that they do this. Whoever came up with this idea has made my wish come true and I hope other restaurants take notice and follow suit.  Absolutely a love!

I've been twice now with a friend and I must say I am a fan. I like that for $12 you can get all you can eat sushi including seaweed salad, tempura, etc.- basically it's a buffet freshly ordered and prepared.   I will be honest and write that I was initially skeptical at the quality of the sushi for the price. And I was pleasantly surprised!  The nigiri is tasty and fresh, not on giant pieces of rice as it sometimes can be.   I usu get the miso soup, seaweed salad, yellowtail, salmon, tuna, California roll and that's pretty much all I can eat before becoming full.   Next time I need to bring some more friends so we can order more sushi and rolls together for me to taste some of the speciality rolls.   The clean rolls Bao H. described sounds wonderful. I will have to order those next time I go in.   The only minor comment I will make is that despite the fact that the interior is nicely decorated, the now defunct conveyor belt for the rotating sushi is a distraction. It makes a poor impression upon initial walk in.   I'm not sure what they can do about it since I am sure it was expensive to install & will be expensive to remove.   Aside from this minor distraction, this place is great for an all you can eat sushi joint!

Come on ladies, you know finding a hair stylist you like and enjoy talking to is hard to find. Plus, sometimes when you are in an open salon, you feel like everyone is hearing your business and even though you'd like to dish, you don't for the lack of privacy.   One of the bonuses about going to Stephanie is that she has her own private space and chair. It's not so small that you feel cramped or uncomfortable. It's spacious enough and decorated in such a way that you feel immediately comfortable.   Plus, Stephanie is a great listener. It doesn't matter whether you are talking about what you want done to your hair or you want to talk about what's going on with your life, she listens- when it comes to your hair, you leave with a great hair cut- when it comes to your life, after talking to her, you feel better.   Everyone wants a great hair stylist who is also a great listener and that's Stepahnie. And the third important factor is that she has her own private space so whatever is shared is between you, her and the walls!  Stepahnie is my hair stylist of choice!!!!

I hovered between 2 and 3 stars and finally settled on 2 stars cause well, no one likes to feel ignored and brushed off!!! It was the grand opening party for Union Barrelhouse and the place was hopping!!!  A fantastic sign for any opening of a restaurant!!!  My son and I were greeted warmly at the door and being Yelpers, were presented with a gift bag at the door (thanks!)  then we sampled their grilled chicken with mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich which was delish.  We got there at 7pm, they must have had an opening for VIP guests cause even though the event invite said 7pm till close, when we got there a little before 7pm, 95% of the complimentary sampling were gone.   NO BIG DEAL- we werent' there just for the free food, we came to support this restaurant (must be the same owner as Salty Senorita) so after we greeted fellow Yelpers Irene V., Laura I, Travis B., and the gang, my son and I looked for a patio table cause we wanted to sit down and have dinner.  Zzzzzz as in the place was buzzing but our waitress was not to be found.  Finally I accosted one and she told me she would be right with me . . . 15 mins later . . . no big deal- there was soccer on tv so we watched the game . . . when she came, we ordered our food- kid's meal chicken tenders with fruit and a farm market salad . . . easy pizy order. Then we waited and waited- my son who was very hungry kept asking where the food was . . . I accosted my waitress and asked- she said it would be right up. (As in, palm in face- don't talk to me, can't you see I'm busy??)  I was understanding- I mean, the place was packed!!! We waited sooooo long that in between waiting my son had time to enter a grilled cheese eating contest where he had 5 minutes to eat 9 grilled cheese sandwiches (which by the way, was very fun)- I don't know how long the contest took- 30 mins?   By the time we got back to our table, our food was still not ready!!!  10 mins later the food comes, the waitress hurriedly throws the food down on the table and just runs away . . . I didn't even get the chance to tell her she gave my son tater tots instead of the fresh fruit side he ordered.  Finally I had to chase her down and accost her again and she said, "oops, I'll bring it right out . . . " 30 mins later we were still waiting!!!  My son kept asking where his fresh fruit was. Finally I chased her down and accosted her AGAIN and this time I asked her to talk to the manager to comp'd our meal for the evening. This is the first time ever in my prolific string of dining experiences where I had to consistently chase down the server- I might have logged a 1/4 of a mile chasing her down!!!  You get the picture. The manager came and was very friendly and apologetic and willingly comp'd our meal.   In terms of pricing, it was $10 for my salad which was medium sized portion, fresh, loved the balsamic vinegarette reduction but I thought it was a bit pricey for the portion and atmosphere of the place.  The chicken tender kid's meal pretty ordinary- nothing to write home about. Atmosphere is great, food ordered okay, service received epic fail.  Manager very understanding and friendly.  Not sure I would come back again.

This was a CMYE event organized by the ever amazing Lindsey.  I'm always happy to go to any fitness related Yelp events- plus, I was curious how barre can be incorporated with yoga and pilates.   First of, the studio itself is big, spacious and beautiful with high ceiling.  Even at full capacity the night of the event, the room did not feel over crowded.  They actually had two rooms- so I think the overflow went to the second room. And without saying, the instructor Carrie was beautiful.  I think you cannot teach a barre class without looking gorgeous with an uplifting personality and spirit.  She had the amazing body and core strength of a dancer.   The class itself was challenging and flowed nicely.  It was an all body workout from legs to core to upper body, working the minute muscles with high repetition.  Many of us in the studio definitely were challenged.  But before you think, oh this class is only for dancers or it's too hard for me- let me write that you have to start somewhere and I think the class is appropriate for all levels.  Plus, I think if you were a beginner, the enthusiasm of the instructors would put you right at ease. Unlike some of the other barre classes I've attended where the focus is so much on ballet moves that I did not consider going back, the class I attended had enough mix of dance moves, yoga, and pilates to keep me engaged that I would return. Juby True was there to give out fresh pressed juice samples.  I tried the Little Miss Sunshine (pineapple, pear, ginger, mint), Roots Radical (red beet, carrot, pear, giner, lemon, turmeric) and Sweet Greens (apple, parsley, spinach, kale, romaine, ginger) and I liked them all. I really liked this place and would consider adding this to my workout routine. Hmmmm, wish there was guarantee that I would look as gorgeous as the instructors after I take the classes!!!

The location is INSIDE SPARK (a collection of salon suites) right next to Party City. So if you are mapping for location, map for SPARK. Don't make the same mistake I did not knowing this tip and drove around for at least 20 mins in frustration trying to find the place.  Once inside SPARK, Sarah who is the owner for Tense Knots and the massage therapist is in suite #109. This part is easy to find as the suite #'s are clearly marked on the door.  Sarah is very sweet and has a good hand with the massages. My left shoulder and neck were in pain and I felt much better after a session with her. I would go back to her again.  The suite itself is one room, nicely decorated. Very peaceful feeling. Despite having noisy hair salons on 2 sides of her and across the hall, once the door was closed it was blissfully silent so you don't have to worry or get disturbed by noise.  She offers first time client specials and a one time 4 massages for $160. Her schedule is quite busy- if you live in the area, check her out, go online and book an appointment with her!!!

I've been reading and hearing about floatation therapy and have been wanting to try it. The few in town were a bit far from me so I was super stoked when one opened up close by where I live.  I scheduled for a floatation immediately followed by a message. After booking, they send you confirmation emails. In the emails, they tell you before coming to the float, do not consume any caffeine and no contact lenses.  The setting immediately upon walking in is serene and restful. Diego was extremely helpful and explained the how the procedure worked to me.  First you take a shower, then you put ear plugs in, get in the pod, close the cover then push a button to let them know you would like the session started then push the other button to turn off the blue light so you lie in restful darkness. Looking at the pod, I was initially a bit nervous since I do not like small spaces and can become claustrophobic. He assured me once in, with the light off, I would feel weightless.  And I have to say, he was right in every sense. The pod feels surprisingly spacious on the inside. And the Epsom salt really did kept me afloat so that I had no sense of space or the surrounding enclosure.  I soon lost track of time dozing in and out and just relaxing into the space. Very soon, there were times I lost sense of the physicality of my own body. I feel both weightless and senseless in an extremely peaceful way. It was incredible! The 60 mins passes faster than you would think. Initially, I had thought how could I possibly stay in darkness floating for an hour then after my session I thought, "oh, it ended too quickly!!!" Afterwards, I was given a nice cup of tea to wait in the relaxation lounge for my massage with Irene.  Now the massage with Irene.  The descriptive word I would use for a massage with Irene would be that it was a soulful massage. An adjective not normally associated with massages yet that was the word that came to my mind when I was lying on the table.  I alternatively drifted between sleep and wakefulness and there were moments when I felt like I was in an ancient forest even though I was fully aware that I was in a massage treatment room in sunny Scottsdale, AZ. That was how I felt. I have received many, many massages in my lifetime. Irene's is the only one I would describe as soulful. You need to experience her massages for yourself. And most likely for you, it would be another word that would come to your mind. For I have a feeling, each one of Irene's massages are different- dependent on who she is treating.  There is no doubt I will be returning there again. In fact, I hope they do not get tired of seeing me!   One word of advice- give yourself plenty of time.  If your floatation session is an hour, plan for at least 90 mins for the shower beforehand and the after then a few minutes of relaxation after that.  I do like the fact that they did not start your full 60 min session until you push the button once you are in the pod.  There are so many things I liked about my experience. As you can tell from this Yelping review!  They have a friend & family referral program where if you mention a friend, I am not sure what I get but I do know you get $20 off of your treatment!  So don't forget to mention Yelp & Su-shien so with the $20 savings, you can go back again!!!

I hesitate to update my review since my previous review was very detailed. I just have to write that please read both!!!  I've been lucky, I can write that I've prob have has hundreds of massages, including daily massages in Southeast Asia when I was fortunate enough to travel through this massage Mecca for 4 months. And I tell you, Ireny's massages surpasses all of them!  Not an exaggeration. Yet, a relaxing massage is not the same as a therapeutic massage that heals you when you are in pain and cannot left your left arm and your left half of the body is frozen for instance. Well, Ireny can do BOTH!!!  Again, not an exaggeration!  I don't know what happened.  Somehow I had kinked my body while putting away the dishes the night before. I feel the pain and went to bed feeling discomforted. When I woke up the next morning, I could not left up my left arm- not even an inch without excruciating pain!!!  By the hour, my left side of the body was spasming in pain and I was barely able to walk.   I thought of Ireny and I called her- luckily she answered the phone herself and I was able to go in the same day in the afternoon. When I showed up, I was a sorry sight!!!  I was in soooo much pain, barely able to drive myself over to her spa. Then I struggled to get my clothes off. I told Ireny my ailments then trusted myself to her hands.   And did she work me through!  She took her time and very carefully manipulated and massaged different areas of my body to release the stress and tension. There were moments when I didn't think I could do what she was asking and she gently coaxed me through it.   Throughout each movement, it was gentle and firm and just what my body needed because by the time she was done, I went from not being able to lift my left arm an inch to being able to lift it over my head!!!!  And within the last two weeks, not sure what is going on with my body, she has had to do this twice and both times I walked away stress free, pain free and renewed!!!!  I've joined their monthly program for the float/massage combo cause it's worth every penny to me. To have a massage with Ireny first then float for meditation I am convince is going to add years to my life.   The added caveat is that both Ireny and her son are soooo nice and down to earth, it's a great feeling for me to know I am supporting a locally owned business!!!  If you mention my name if you ever go in for a float or membership, I think I get a free float- so I will love you forever.   Actually, once you've been there yourself after reading this review and the last one that I wrote, you will love me & Yelp forever!!!

Cafe Tranquilo is owned by the Clarendon Hotel and it's a great add.  Now that the hotel and restaurant is owned by the same owner, you can order room service while staying at the hotel.   The food here is excellent and mouth watering delicious! On Sat, I had a party of 6 adults and 6 kids by the pool during lunch time and we were provided with great service by Yusa. Everything we had was good.  The chips & salsa, chips & guacamole (chunky full of fresh guacamole & flavorful), grilled cheese sandwich- everyone enjoyed their food.  And it was promptly served. Which can be a factor when receiving poolside service from an on site restaurant.  Great add & I look forward to getting room service while staying at the Claredon!

Walking in, the place reminded me of places in Asia and parts of California where you do not need to speak English to get by.    The detox was good. I knew my water would turn color.  The massage since I was not expecting much was better than how I thought it would be.   I did have an advantage since I speak Chinese so I was able to converse with the therapist so maybe that gave me an edge.   I actually had a great conversation with the therapist & her mom who was visiting so overall a good one.

I have to say OHSO opened at the perfect location to create the perfect neighborhood hangout.  The whole setup is perfect for the area where families can walk~ yes, you read that right~ there are actually lots of families who live in the neighborhood that either walk or bike to OHSO.  Anytime you can get Arizonians to forgo their cars and either walk or bike to your dig, you know you are doing something right!  Notice the multiple uses of the adjective "perfect"~ this pretty much sums up OHSO!  Any time, any day of the week I can walk into OHSO and bump into someone I know~ whether it's my neighbor, families from school, families from activities, people from places I frequent~ they are there, drinking, eating & socializing.  The best part about OHSO in all of their locations is their atmosphere.  It's continually warm and inviting regardless of the weather outside or what else is going on in your life.  You walk into OHSO and you feel better.    On top of that, besides the huge selection of beer and good food, they have games like ping pong and corn holes outside that are both kid and adult friendly.  Did I mention they welcome dogs too?  It's the perfect place for people to gather and socialize.  I love going there.  5 stars from me! #OHSO @ohsobrewery

Came here for a holiday lights open house this year.   You park at the south side of the church at 5225 E. Camelback and there is a door that you walk through to get to the Wright House.   I have to share, it was a beautiful evening. The weather was warm and even before we got out of our car, we could see the hundreds of Christmas lights twinkling in the distance.   As we walked through the door, we were greeted warmly by volunteers and there was a long, long driveway leading to a giant Christmas tree beautifully lit, the long driveway continues to the house.   There was a string quartet playing and hot chocolate/ coffee & macaroon served by the Henry.   I brought my 9 year old son & his friend with me. There were not too many kids there which was too bad since the look of wonder on their faces were priceless.   They were old enough to appreciate the experience and the architecture. It created a memorable experience for them.   The house itself is being restored and sits on I think sits on at least a 3 acre property. It's beautiful & worth a visit.   Thank you for opening this up for the public for this holiday season!

I've been an Yelp Elite for 5 years and this has to go down in the books as the worst event I've ever attended. I feel bad for the Yelp Elites whose first experience was this event. I promise you- this is a very atypical experience.  This review as many of the reviews have written, is not for the volunteer or the food truck vendor- it's for the organization of the festival itself.  One word description:  dismal. In addition to agreeing to everything Mary S. wrote in her review, I had to add that the restaurants featured in the sample village were staffed with volunteers. I asked several of the booths the name of the restaurant of the food I was sampling & none of them knew!!!! In addition, the volunteers were doing the cooking at some of them . . . with no prior training or licensing- what?!?!?! At several of the booths, the volunteers told me they were ready to walk off & go home it was soooo disorganized.  The only reason I am giving this festival one star is because I need to give it one star to write a review. If possible, I would give this particular festival zero star!
