Ok, I've never been a fan of this place. I've visited 3 different locations nationally. I came here tonight for my brother in laws birthday. We waited forever to be seated. They were, by no means, busy. Then, they did not have place settings out for us. A young man eventually came and took our drink orders and we explained how we wanted the checks to be split "that side of the table and the couple over here are separate." Then another server came and did the same thing. They young man went to tell her what we ordered and she just said "I'll do it, again, myself." We re-gave the orders and waited about 20 minutes for drinks. The our order was screwed up. Again, never a fan of bland, over-priced Italian food. The food was as expected. We had to wait for oil and vinegar, wait for cutlery, wait for napkins, wait for bread plates. Then the checks came and we, the couple, were given another members check and were embarrassed to say, "this is with the other patrons." And then, my sister in-law reminded the server, again, that it was my brother in laws birthday. We were the only people on the second floor and they announce to all eight of us it was his birthday. They clapped and sang and no type of dessert was offered. We waited another 20 minutes for the dessert and they said, "oh, we don't do much for birthdays. If you sign up for our club you will get a brownie next year." There was no, "Have a good night, thanks for coming," nothing. Not getting the checks right,nor not getting anything right, especially when you spay $22 dollars for a bowl of pasta, is unacceptable. It was nice to spend time with family but I hope to God I never have to go to this place again and I would never recommend it. Olive Garden, overall, is way better.

I just have to say that the Kearny Asada burrito for $5.99 is the best thing in the area hot fresh they got a choice of a green sauce guacamole sauce and a really really hot sauce pico de gallo and it's out of control

The soft shell crab bun is AWESOME. All the menu items rock. They have noodles and rice and good beer. Great atmosphere     They always have the same staff. That's a sign of a top notch restaurant. Shout out to the kitchen, for all the hard work!

Tried this place for the first time. I had th steak gyro with fries. You could tell the cook the steak fresh. Juicy, soft , and good! My lady had Greek salad with chicken. It was filled with all types of vegetables . Very flavorful and filling. I will be back for sure.

Me and my friends love to come to Ocotillo for lunch, their chicken is amazing this is one of the 5 that they offer Peruvian. And the homemade baked Lamache with Sicilian Ragu sausage and house pulled mozzarella if you haven't been here you have try it. chef Sasha Levine and chef Walter Sterling  have hit a home run!
