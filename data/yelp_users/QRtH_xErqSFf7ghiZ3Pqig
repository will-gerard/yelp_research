This was my first time visiting Mimi's in Ahwatukee for Mother's Day. We were a party of 6 and I had made a reservation a week prior knowing they would be busy that day. We arrived at one o'clock for a reservation at the same time and waited 25 min to be seated. when they seated us, it was at 2 rickety tables thrown together right at the entrance to the dining room so that all guests and wait staff would have to be constantly trying to get around us when entering and leaving. one table was so wobbly you couldn't have eaten off of it and half of the chairs were METAL FOLDING CHAIRS...yes, the kind you sit in at Aunt Mary's backyard shindig. The metal chairs were bent and had metal poking my son in the back so he had to lean forward to sit in it. I told them this will not work and we want to be moved. We then went back to the lobby and waited another 10 minutes to be seated in a back room to the left that looked like overflow dining and the ambiance was crap. it looked like an old shed or something that had been converted for extra seating. They handed us the menu, which was 2 one sheet laminated menus and had very limited offerings for Mother's Day. When I made the reservation I specifically asked if it was full menu and was told yes because i have 2 kids that are picky eaters and knew they would order a hamburger. no hamburger on this menu. i asked the hostess if this was the full menu and she snottily said yes, that's it. I then asked the waiter why it was so limited and he had to go ask mgmt if they were serving full menu and came back with the lunch and dinner menus. I'm guessing they weren't but accommodated us after I complained.   The food was mediocre. I ordered the cranberry pesto turkey sandwich and they literally had about 9 fries on my plate. My kids that ordered burgers had a plate full but I had 9. I literally laughed out loud. The only bright spot was our waiter who was VERY attentive. They gave us each a free muffin to take home.   Then, to top it off, the next morning I went to use my debit card and realized it was missing. Tried to remember when I last used it...Mimi's. Called them and sure enough, they had it. It was then I realized that the waiter never brought my card back to me after he ran it. I remember the 2 white receipts in the billfold that I signed and no card. Yes, I should have realized it and asked about it before leaving so I take partial responsibility but they definitely dropped the ball yet again. when I walked into the restaurant to get the card, the manager checked my id and told me, "glad you realized you forgot it. these things happen." No, I didn't forget it, your waiter never gave it back to me.  All in all, very disappointed in my experience on what was supposed to be a nice treat for my mom on Mother's Day. I might give Mimi's a second chance with a smaller party but i will NEVER take the chance of celebrating a special occasion there again. It really upset me that our Mother's Day was so blah.

Will not go back ever. Took my vehicle after being directed there by Discount Tire because my alignment was off and discount gave me a coupon well they must be in cahoots with each other. Walked over there from discount while my tires were being put on and made an appt for the following day. They remind me of cheesy used car salesmen with their corny one liners and fake attitudes. Of course they found more issues for an additional $900 saying my wheel arms were loose. I said no just do the alignment. Took my car home and seemed to drive nice until I backed out of my driveway and turned the wheel left and heard a grinding noise from my right wheel now every time I back out or turn left it makes that grinding noise and it didn't do it before I brought my car in there then the next morning I get in my car and running late get on the freeway looked down and noticed none of my gauges are on my entire dashboard is disconnected I call the shop while I'm on the freeway telling him what happened and asked if they something with my dashboard wires and the guy was defensive and rude. It was the day before Thanksgiving and he told me I could bring my car in but they were very busy and he have to get to me when he could. I cancelled and took it somewhere else I will never go back there again and they still effed up my car

I go to this location for convenience but have been to better Home Depots. I can never ever EVER find someone to help me or answer a question. I was looking for a reciprocating saw (I'm a woman) and had no idea what to look for and stood in the saw/tool aisle for 20 minutes looking confused. 3 employees walked right by me and never once asked if I needed help. not once. I always see orange aprons walking around like ghosts in the graveyard but when it comes time to getting help...they are but a figment of my imagination. The only person that speaks to you is the person trying to sell you a new ac unit when you walk through the front door. The other thing I can't stand is the self checkout. They usually have only one register open near the contractors desk and the rest is self check out that takes forever. Half the time something doesn't ring up correctly or it says wait for attendant. what happened to good, old fashioned customer service and interaction????

Dont know why i keep coming here. Never can get help associates walk right by when im clearly looking for something. Asked to have a key made today and the guy told me he needs to hurry cuz he needs to go home. With as many bad reviews u would think they would at least attempt to make things better

I hate this Wal mart but it's closest. It's dirty, it smells and apparently they don't have any cashiers. I always wait longer in line than it took me to shop

CK's used to be my favorite place to hang out on a night out and my kids begged to go there to eat however, something has changed in the last year or so and not for the better. The food seems to have gone from amazing to blah...orders not cooked right, portions smaller and just doesn't taste the same. The place needs some TLC...rips in some of the booths, tables not clean and food stuck on surfaces. The staff used to be chatty and friendly and now they just seem catatonic like they don't really want to be there. They used to have a great mix of bands playing for all tastes and now each time I've been it seems like the music is more for the Florida retirement crowd. I want the old CK's back!...I would like to add that not even an hour after I posted this review, Kendra from CK's responded to my concerns. I am very impressed with their desire to find out what their customers want and take negative feedback in a positive light to give their customers a great experience. I think I will have to raise my rating based on  that! Great job Kendra!

I reviewed CK's a while back and I would like to say since then, their service has really come back up to par, their food is great and we are regular customers once again. I ordered take out tonight and they were super fast, the food was hot and great and I was so impressed that no less than 4 staff members either asked to assist me or told me thank you for coming, have a great evening. I'm so glad because I have always loved this neighborhood eatery

Advantage has been our preferred vendor since 1998! We are a prop mgmt co and they do a great job. They work really hard to accomodate our schedule and are very thorough and knowledable. I have referred them to clients and friends and they have all been very happy with Larry and the staff at Advantage!

Took my teenagers here spur of the moment after doing some shopping..first timers. It was a weeknight around 730 so wasn't very busy. Great ambiance on a chilly evening with the fire in the lobby and chess games. We were seated immediately and our waiter was prompt courteous and light hearted...joked with us and made the kids laugh. The bread is soo good! 2 of us ordered salads and they brought them out right away before entree. Fast service. We had the burgers which were delicious. Drinks stayed filled and waiter was very attentive. We were so full with the large portion sizes we took a doggie bag home. They have a very extensive menu and I noticed they have a very nice sized vegetarian and gluten free menu for an American food restaurant. Finally something for my vegetarian daughter to eat when we all want to grub on meat lol. I also like that they let you sub Boca patties for any burgers.we also ordered a to go order for my son to take home for his gf and the waiter timed it perfectly to be ready when we were done and ready to go. we will definitely be back....with the vegetarian in tow

I'm so disappointed that SCC has turned into a third rate community college. I went there 18 years ago and it was wonderful! Now, they really don't give a crap about their students or their athletes. They do not have anyone to walk new freshman through the process or help you navigate what to do. When you call or go in for assistance, you get a different answer every time and only half of the information. The employees in admissions, financial aid and cashier are not friendly at all and don't even smile. they act like it is a bother for you to ask them anything. they have students manning many of the help desks there and they don't know anything! I would rather pay more for a better school that acts like they actually care that you are spending your education dollars there. In addition, their athletics are a joke. You would think their coach would help their athletes that they recruited sign up for the right classes, make sure they have all the necessary docs, etc...nope. nothing. not only that but they tell you everything at the last minute. they booked a MANDITORY athletic orientation and told the athletes the day before. Many had work or had no transportation and they said...tough, its required. They make their athletes pay for practice jerseys! and even transport themselves to games because they can't afford enough buses or vans to transport the athletes. GHETTO!

Like others, I wish I could give zero stars. I am a property mgr and real estate agent and this is by far the WORST, most dishonest and unprofessional company I have every dealt with. Speaking with them, especially Anthony, is like being in the twilight zone. I'm not sure if he has a mental issue or is on drugs but every time I have dealt with this guy it leads to an argument and him hanging up on me. He yelled at me and told me to do my job and if i did, the maintenance wouldn't be happening. Really? In addition, this warranty doesn't seem to cover anything. I deal with warranties all day long and I have never seen a warranty deny so many services in my life. RUN from this company and don't look back. I don't even know how they are still in business

Yet another catastrophe dealing with this home warranty they refused to assign another vendor to install a new water heater in a timely manner and would only send expert mechanical upon researching online I found out expert mechanical and this home warranty are owned by the same person major conflict of interest and unethical I will be filing a complaint with the Registrar of contractors for deceptive practices and possible fraud

I can't say enough good things about Fred and the group at Cross Mechanical. It was a godsend that I found them. They actually were sent to my home by home warranty through my landlord and did such a great job I started using them for the properties I manage. They have been our go to ac/heating co for over 5 years now and had nothing but excellent service willing to go the extra mile every time from coordinating w/ tenants to speaking w/ owners to explain what's happening. We have one owner who is a gen contractor they installed a new unit and this owner STILL raves about them. Cross Mechanical does all of our spring ac tune ups and winter heat tune ups and we have seen a significant drop in service calls from tenants as a result of this. They have gone out at the drop of a hat in an emergency and are always willing to accomodate us. And the best part is, if anything ever does go wrong, Fred and his crew do what it takes to make it right. I wish all of my vendors operated with the same integrity as Cross Mechanical. They are my go to vendor for LIFE!

I LOVE this place! the decor/atmosphere is great, patio is amazing in nice weather and the food is delish. We had the nachos and Garfield Grilled Cheese with bacon and apple. The food is fresh, great portions. But the best thing about this place is the staff..every time I've been they are personable, checking in often to see if we need anything. Today there was a homeless woman that was outside in 115 degrees in distress from the heat. The male bartender brought her inside and sat her down, gave her water and cool towels and asked her if he could do anything else and then called the ambulance for her when it was clear she was in heat distress. He treated her with the utmost of respect and attentiveness just like a paying customer. Bravo for doing it right!

First time here. Was pretty busy with Stanley Cup on but even being busy were greeted and seated promptly.  Our waitress was great and checked on us often. we ordered the bone in hot wings and I loved them. I'm a picky wing eater and they were perfect amount of sauce and crisp but tender inside. We ordered the build your own burgers. They were good. Not great but decent. I liked the atmosphere. I want to try them at night and for karaoke.

I've been here twice now for repairs and an oil change. I'm very impressed with their professionalism, thoroughness and promptness. I never had to call and check on my vehicle...they always kept me posted, explained what was wrong and gave recommendations on what I should and did not have to spend money on. I was pleasantly surprised at their pricing too. While no one likes to spend money on costly repairs, I think their prices are fair and even a little less than most shops I've been raked by. They also guarantee their work. My ac went out again about a month after they fixed a seal leak and they told me its guaranteed for a year to bring back in anytime no charge. So glad there is a place in Tukee that I can trust!

I hate this circle k out of all ever been to. It always smells, their freezers have been broken for over 2 months and always out of stock on common stuff. The ice and fountain drinks are often broken. Employees are rude and unfriendly and usually a huge line takes forever because they have one person at register at a very busy store. Then I go there at 1:30 a.m. tonight on a Friday the night before Halloween and they've got a sign on the door saying closed until the floors dry there's people waiting outside to go in and so the clerk unlocks the door and lets people in floors were still partially wet I walk over to get a polar pop which was the only reason I drove up there at that time of night and he gruffly tells me please don't walk on that so what am I supposed to do not get what I came here for? Why would you choose 1:30 at night to mop the floors on a Friday night the night before Halloween it's busy dude wait till like 3 a.m. change the name to inconvenience store. I will now drive all the way to the foothills store.
