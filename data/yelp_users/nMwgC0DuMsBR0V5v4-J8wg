Thanks to Yelp, I found this awesome car repair shop.  I have nothing but the absolute BEST things to say about them.  The most professional, honest and effecient that I have ever worked with.  Unfortunately, I just bought a "lemon" and 25th St. Automotive took some of the pain out this process.  They are just amazing....I knew that the transmission was most likely shot.  They spent the minimum amout of time and money to confirm this and were more than accomodating.  I would bring another car back here in a heartbeat.   Overall, a it's very dismal circumstance regarding my newly purchased used car, but an absolutely fabulous experience with 25th Street Automotive.

So, shame on me for not taking the reviews of this place seriously and actually suggesting it for lunch today.  It happens to be in a convenient location (in chain restaurant hell off of Stapley and the 60) and we've had drinks there a couple of times.  It's really a pretty restaurant inside....too bad the food doesn't live up to the atmosphere.  They've been advertising $5.99 lunch specials via their email list, so I thought it might be worth a try.    The large  menu seems fairly impressive and includes fresh seafood, fried specialties, pasta, salads and a long list of sandwiches and wraps.  We opted to share the Calamari Salad and the fried  Alaskan Cod/Shrimp/Chicken lunch.  We should have been forewarned when the food suddenly appears within five minutes of ordering.  To put it nicely, the salad just plain sucked.  The menu describes it as a Greek salad....NOT.  Wilted romaine lettuce tossed with some sort of sickeningly sweet poppyseed dressing (WTH?) and a few pieces of calamari on top.  I will say, however, that the tender, non-greasy pieces of calamari are the reason why I'm NOT giving this place one star.  The fried platter was OK...she ate the fish and I ate the shrimp and chicken.  The fries weren't bad...just nothing to write home about and the cole slaw was barely passable.      The service wasn't much better than two stars as well....I mean just because we're drinking H2O with lemon and not having cocktails doesn't mean you can ignore our need for refills. On our last visit we sat at the bar and ordered martinis...I guess that doesn't count.  Anyway, we didn't pay for the salad (thank God) and I left starving..it really wasn't even the equivalent of sharing two appetizers since the portions are small to begin with and we weren't inclined to finish either dish.  I'm embarressed to say it, but I'm sure Red Lobster would have been a better option, or, even Long John Silvers for that matter :(

I started eating at Macaroni Grill when I moved to AZ in 1998... back in the days of the big jug of wine on the "honor system" when you could catch a good buzz for $4 a person!  I've always had a great dining experience here including good service, great food, fun atmosphere and an overall solid value.  I ate in the bar last night and had the Grilled Chicken Spedini (see pic) which was a perfect meal of grilled chicken skewers (2) marinated in olive oil, garlic, lemon and rosemary served over grilled vegetables and roasted potatoes, delicious, light and healthy at $9.99.  I love their focaccia bread with olive oil for dipping.  It was very busy which is usually the case on a Friday night.  The service was solid, and I will definitely be back to this location.

I just don't understand why anyone eats breakfast at a place like Denny's when you can go to Mimi's and have SUCH a different experience (like servers who haven't been up late drinking the night before).  I have always loved this place (it's on my A-OK chain list), especially for breakfast.  The atmosphere is cute and charming, the servers generally seem to be a higher caliber and I love the variety of flavors on their breakfast menu.  If you sign up for the Mimi's e-club, they instantly send you a coupon for a free breakfast (up to a $10 value).  With items like Pain Perdue Stuffed French Toast, Eggs Benedict Florentine and a Chipotle Breakfast Burrito it was a difficult decision.  I, however, settled on the healthiest option (I checked the caloric content on the website), the Capresse Omlette which was just delish and includes diced tomatoes, red onions and basil topped with sliced tomatoes and fresh mozzerella and a tomato cream sauce which I ordered on the side.  My dining partner ordered the Ham & Cheddar Croissant (a whopping 1,235 calories, but apparently worth it) with breakfast potatoes.  So, along with being a price Nazi, I've become a calorie Nazi.  Most of the breakfast entrees include a freshly baked muffin and fresh squeezed juice.  It was a perfectly delicious and very filling breakfast.  Our server was just fabulous and I gave her double the tip I normally would have since I used the coupon for a free breakfast.  I can't wait to come back here in a week or two, and BTW do try to come during the week if possible as the wait is significantly less.

I'm still on a buffet binge and Indian food sounded like a nice change of pace.  After driving around "the hood" aka the 24th St. and Thomas area after a meeting today, I was unable to find a suitable buffet.  So, I headed back to Chandler.  I thought I remembered driving by an Indian restaurant on Chandler Blvd. at one point and was pleasantly surprised when I found India Gate.  The atmosphere is sort of cozy ethnic,and  reminds me of the Bay Area .  I was seated quickly and I thought the service was friendly considering the language barrier.  I was impressed by the selections on the lunch buffet and thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried.  The food was hot, fresh and with what appeared to be good quality meat (tried lamb curry and chicken vindaloo) and the heat factor was moderate.  The best part about the meal with the garlic naan....pure carb heaven.   It's $9.99 which is somewhat higher than some other buffets at lunch, but I felt the overall experience was well worth it.

OK, I really feel that this place rocks...chain or no chain, CF is in another league when it comes to chain restaurants.  I have yet to have a bad experience (or even anything mediocre) at any of the locations.  The overall quality, selection, atmosphere and service are always top notch.  I generally only eat lunch here, dinner on occasion and even at the peak of the lunch hour, I have never experienced slow or lacking service.  Today we were really hungry, so we started with Buffalo Blasts for an appetizer, these are amazing (see pics).  They taste like a fabulous combination of fried chicken and hot wings, served with hot sauce, blue cheese (the real deal) and celery sticks.  We both ordered salads, the BBQ Ranch Chicken (topped with onion rIngs) and the Chinese Chicken salad which has always been delicious.  We finished off the meal with a slice of Vanilla Bean cheesecake which is lighter than some of the other kinds, and absolutely delicious.  I could enjoy a big bowl of the whip cream by itself!  Overall, I really enjoy this place and always look forward to treating myself to lunch here.  And it doesn't hurt that it's in the mall....lunch AND shopping is never a bad thing :)

I really like Pick Up Stix and it's certainly superior to that steam table garbage they try to pass off as Chinese food at Panda Express. Of course, it helps that the food is made to order.   I  also like the variety of their menu which includes salads, noodle dishes, lunch combinations and regular dinner entrees.  Having brown rice as an option is always a good thing.  I had the Thai Spicey Chicken Dragon Meal ($4.99) which is an individual portion (although I ate it in three portions, it was huge), brown rice and a side salad.  Delicious and not extremely spicey.  If you visit their website, you can download coupons and order online.  Service was fast and friendly, and I will definitely be back.

Yes, I'm reviewing another chain restaurant. I've decided that there are a select few that warrant patronizing, especially for lunch. My last four lunches at Olive Garden (I had to exhaust a $100 gift card) have been a solid 3.5-4.5 stars. Hey, you have to give them credit for actually making iceberg lettuce taste good!!   So, I met a girlfriend here for lunch today and we had a great meal and were not made to feel guilty for a hogging a booth for a full two hours. As always, the salad arrived fresh, salad bowls nicely chilled and bread sticks warm and buttery :) I proceeded to eat three full bowls of salad...I swear their croutons actually tasted homemade today, I must have been imaging it, but they were a nice touch. She had the Eggplant Parmigiana and was able to substitute fresh asparagus, broccoli and chopped tomatoes for the pasta. It looked delicious. I had the Capellini Pomodoro which, according to our fabulous waiter, was "one of the healthiest things on the menu" (I'm planning to splurge at Filiberto's tomorrow!). It seriously tastes very fresh and healthy (love fresh basil) and I couldn't finish it all.   I have to give honerable mention to the Chicken Alfredo Pizza which was ordered by my dining companion on a previous visit.  Although it probably contains more than 2,000 calories, it is AMAZING....if they don't give you enough buttery, creamy alfredo sauce on the pizza itself, they include a side order for dipping...YUMM!!!  Overall, great service, nice atmosphere and VERY good food. I'm just sorry that they're related to Red Lobster, what a shame. I will be back for sure....maybe soup and salad next time?

I love, love, love the Keg!  I've been to this location as well as San Tan Village, Tempe Marketplace and Desert Ridge and have had nothing but exceptional food and service. I really like the atmosphere, it has that dark, cozy steakhouse feeling without being too stuffy or pretentious.    We enjoyed an excellent  Halloween dinner here last night which included a "Keg sized" glass of Fetzer chardonnay, a margarita (very strong), the Keg Classic Dinner (ceasar salad, 7 oz filet wrapped in bacon, mixed vegetables and a loaded baked potato), bacon wrapped scallops (an appetizer that I ordered for my entree) and their fabulous bread with whipped butter, YUM!  Our server was very outgoing and friendly and offered suggestions as far as the menu.  The bill with tax and tip was $68, really an excellent value.   Overall, a great meal and dining experience.  I will definitely be back and can't wait!

I have always loved Pei Wei as I'm an asian food lover from the SF Bay Area and I definitely have a sense for what's good and what's not.  Some might question the authenticity of their food, and I'm not asian so I don't consider myself to be an authority.  I do, however, LOVE the Pad Thai with chicken and tofu and everytime I order it, I'm in heaven :)  The portion is huge, seriously enough for 2-3 meals, the flavor is excellent, it's a little greasey which adds to the texture of the rice noodles, the chicken breast pieces are more than abundant and the tofu has a fabulous texture.  The crushed peanuts, lime and cilantro create a party in my mouth!!!  You just can't beat the overall quality, service and price.   It makes joints like Panda Express look embarrassing by comparison.  I like the fact that Pei Wei also rotates in new menu items (Sesame Chicken is new) and you can order brown rice as an option.

I'm one of those 75/25 eaters.  I try to eat healthy 75% of the time and I would be happy eating at Filibertos the other 25%!  I must have Latin blood in me because I CRAVE this food!!!  I've had dreams about greasy mexican food like this!!!  Seriously, the green chile burrito is the BOMB.  And I swear, it's not even that greasy....just delicious morsels of pork in a perfect green sauce and not too spicy (I have acid reflux, so this place can create serious pain!)   Where can you get such an authentic, delicious meal for $4.00?  I know I'm a fan :)

I had forgetten about Chen's and happened to be driving by today, so I stopped in for lunch.  Decided to dine in...the atmosphere is very clean and it was fairly quiet.  I was surprised to see that the lunch combos are still only $4.95, it's really a bargain for the quality of food.    As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I eat a lot of asian food and, therefore, am always comparing quality, value, portion size etc.  The lunch started off with egg drop soup which was nice and light and an iceberg salad with an asian type of ranch dressing .  The entree (as pictured) included fried rice, a spring roll and and a crab puff, delicious.  There was enough food left over for another meal and the service was extremely prompt and friendly.  This is a really good choice for a neighborhod chinese place in the far SE valley, either dine in or take out.  I've never been disappointed.

I love this place....and all divey mexican joints for that matter!  I was in the area today, and was unfortuantely still full from lunch, so I didn't stop.  I used to drive by every morning on my way to work and would go through the drive thru at least 2-3 times a week to pick up breakfast AND lunch.  I don't care how dirty their kitchen is....I have never gotten sick, EVER.  When I was on a low-carb diet, I would order a burrito, eat the insides and I was still full!!!  Now, I fully indulge in the greasy, lard-filled, carb-filled goodness.  How can you go wrong with a breakfast combo of scrambled eggs w/ ham, refried beans and fresh tortillas...YUMM!!!  I agree that their "hot sauce" is very watery, but it still works.  Carne asada, carnitas, pollo asado, it's all good ")

I've eaten at this location at least 10-12 times and have never been disappointed.  The fact that it's been in business so long (early 80's?) certainly says something.  It definitely has that outdated, whitewashed decor with bad fake plants and too much lighting, but the food is solid, fast Japanese and is reasonably priced.  I also like the fact that they have a drive-thru.  I've tried a number of items on the menu including the Sushi combos, chicken/noodle salads and the low carb entrees w/ all veggies and no rice,  however, the last few times I've ordered the Bento Box B.  It offers a nice combination of flavors and satisfies my need for variety and spice.  Served in a somewhat traditional style bento box, it includes Thai Beef Salad (very noticeable heat factor), Teriyaki Chicken, steamed rice/mixed veggies, inside-out California Roll, edamame and a small egg roll which is either pork or beef.  I would also recommend Bento Box A which includes Yakiniku Beef w/ Cabbage, steamed rice/mixed veggies, Teriyaki Chicken, green salad w/ ginger dressing, edamame and an egg roll.  If I'm in the S. Scottsdale area and hungry for lunch, I will usually stop here.

All I can say is, um no thank you...this place is completely awful. And, I have not, nor will I EVER attempt to sell anything here.  I remember being a huge BE fan when it first opened in the SF Bay Area in about 1990.  I was a starving community college student and would be ecstatic at the overstuffed bag of  cute, stylish clothes that I could purchase for less than $30 bucks.    How times have changed.  I can't believe they are actually selling used crap like this for $15-25 a piece, and previously worn shoes generally turn me off unless they're in excellent shape with an equally awesome price.  But, $26.50 for some nasty old Target clod hopppers, WTH???  This place makes My Sister's Closet look like Neiman Marcus!!!

I've been stopping by Last Chance everytime I'm in the Biltmore area since I moved to Phoenix in 1998.  I just stopped by again today...what a big fat waste of time!!!  I'm not sure what draws me back to this place, is it the "bargain basement" feel, the racks of used shoes, the frenzy of women hunting around for that amazing treasure?  I have no idea, but this place sucks!!!!!!!  I"ve probably found no more than a half a dozen "deals" in the eleven years I've been frequenting this glorified Good Will.  I completely scoured the racks today and found NOTHING that I would have taken home for free.  The clothes are gargage sale quality and the shoes and purses are pathetic.  How about a nicely scuffed up pair of Michael Kors (ugly) pumps for $49.99?  COME ON!!!!!  You're better off upstairs at Marshalls where the stuff doesn't look like it's been through the washing machine.  I think this is finally my LAST stop at LAST Chance, and I'm relieved :)))

I just moved to Chandler and was happy to see the many asian restaurant choices in the area :)  I guess being in the vicinity of Le Le's market is a good thing.  I've ordered take out from this place twice in the last week....LOVE their food!  It reminds me of SF style...more unusual menu options (plus the regulars) with a ton of flavor and spice.  I would definitely reorder everything including:  Shredded Pork w/ Garlic Sauce (delicious) Black Pepper Chicken w/ Scallions (fabulous) Black Pepper Beef Chow Mein (spicy!) Beef Chow Fun w/ Black Bean Sauce (big portion) Egg Rolls (perfectly crisp)  This will definitely be a regular spot.....the prices are extremely moderate with two entrees and four egg rolls at less than $20 :)  ***Update - I just increased this place to five stars as I absolutely LOVED what I ordered tonight***  Deep Fried Tofu Stuffed w/ Pork & Shrimp - a very unusual dish which I don't recall ever seeing on a chinese menu...FABULOUS!  Chicken Chow Mein - Perfect!  One of the best I've ever had...perfectly seasoned, not too greasy, delicious chunks of chicken breast, scallions, onions and cabbage.    Even their white rice is amazing...delicious, light & fluffy :)

I've always loved Oregano's....they have a fabulous menu, a great vibe and service seems to always be spot on.  Although parking can be a challenge at this location, if you get there before 11:30 and secure a seat on the patio, it is, overall, a very nice, relaxing dining experience.    I ordered the Vino Bambino Jr. Salad ($6.99) which is "romaine lettuce with corkscrew pasta, black olives, red bell peppers, pinto beans, scallions, parmesan cheese and fresh cilantro topped with wine-marinated chicken, sauteed onions, red bell peppers and sun-dried tomatoes."  I substituted fat-free Roasted Red Pepper Italian dressing for the caesar.  Overall, it was very light and delicious but filling. Although, I really wanted a big, greasy sandwich with sweet potato fries!    My friend had the Jr. Oregano's Favorite Salad (add chicken) which includes romaine lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, spiced feta cheese, roasted red peppers, red onions, pine nuts and raisins, and she took half of it home.  I really want to come back and indulge in some heavier menu items  like the stuffed pizza, pizza cookie etc.  But, that will require that I commit to a serious workout either before or after!

OK, call me lame, but I actually enjoy this place.  I even go out of my way when I'm at AZ Mills to walk ALL the way around so that I can check it out.  Maybe it gives me just a little bit of that "over the top" VegasISH themed whatever (since I'm not popping for a trip to sin city at the present time), but it's certainly a kid friendly atmosphere.  You can't argue that it doesn't have much competition in the Valley of the Sun (and heat and dust).    So, I've perused the menu and would certainly not go out of my way to eat a meal here based on prior reviews.  I am, however, reviewing it based on my experience with a mid-day cocktail last week which was KILLER.  My partner and I ordered a large (21 ounce) Margarilla which is a frozen Cuervo Gold (I believe) margarita with orange sherbert.  It ROCKED and I had a serious buzz on the way out.  At $10.99 each, it's not cheap, however, the bartender did give us a souvenier glass to take home.  And, I got to sit on a zebra barstool :)

I have always loved this place!  There is something about the ambiance here, and Cave Creek in general.  When I lived in the area from 1998-2002, I would frequent it for lunch at least once every few months.  Now that I live in the far SE valley, I will still make the occasional "trek" up north!  The food is very good, in my opinion, and I have eaten a lot of Mexican food in my day.  Today I ordered the chicken enchilada lunch w/ green sauce, rice & beans.  It was just delicious...piping hot, not too spicy, with large pieces of chicken breast with that greasy, cheesy goodness smothered on top.  It was too hot to sit out on the patio, so a nice table with a view of the pond was relaxing.  Yes, the pond water is dirty!!!!  But the ducks and turtles don't seem to mind :)  I've been here a few times in the evening, and the enlarged patio with the fireplace and tree lights etc. make for a wonderful place to have a few drinks and enjoy a nice relaxing dinner.

I finally had the opportunity to try this place.  The atmosphere is fabulous...love the decor which feels sort of chic, elegant yet understated with a great mix of colors and textures...I'm very aesthetic and a beautifully decorated restuarant ususally enhances my reviews :)  We were seated in the far back room which was nice, comfortable, well lit and very quiet.  I was immediately impressed with the lunch menu which felt very comprehensive and certainly not overpriced whatsoever.  I opted for the Curry Chicken Salad ($11) which includes field greens, chicken breast, sliced almonds and golden raisens with a two dressing combination of creamy curry and a red wine vinagarette which I ordered on the side.  I ate every last bite of the salad.  She ordered the Heirloom Beet Salad ($11) which was a very nice presentation.  The focaccia bread with pesto dipping sauce edged my carb craving.  Oh, I can't forget the fabulous Black Iced Tea (with a hint of tropical flavor) which was just delicious.    The service was extremely friendly and attentive...absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  It was an extremely nice dining experience and I'm looking forward to returning soon.

I would say 2.5 stars for this place, and I say that somewhat hesitantly.   Let's agree that quantity without quality is not always a good thing.  I can't say that my lunch was bad, but the large portion of Teriyaki Chicken  ($4.59 w/ tax) with the super big chunks of dark meat chicken (or was it?) , extra sweet, syrupy sauce (I know, it's teriyaki) and just plain 'ole white rice was definitely edible, but not memorable.  Service was fast, but not especially friendly.    From now on,  I'll think I'll reserve my asian fix for a slighly more "upscale" spot, like Pei Wei for a few bucks more.

As a die hard bargain shopper and a long time fan of consignment stores, I absolutely LOVE My Sister's Closet.  I have been to the Scottsdale stores as well as the Camelback location and feel that neither are consistently as good as the Chandler store.    On my last two visits I have found a beautiful suit, one DKNY in taupe and one Anne Klein in Black/White pinstrip.  Not only did they both look and fit fabulously, but they were between $20 to $30 EACH.  These are ridiculous bargains!!!!  I also found an adorable denim jacket in some designer brand I never heard of for $10 and a really hot gold sweater (BCBG) for $12.  Not only are there regular prices amazing, but when the whole store is an ADDITIONAL 30 to 50 percent off, it's beyond fun.    My mother will be visiting at the end of March and the first place she wants to go is My Sister's Closet!

I stopped here for lunch today planning to get take out, but when I found out they charge by the pound, I figured I might as well eat in.  I was dining solo and had some studying to do....it was busy but not too noisy and beverage service was very prompt.  I would have to agree that many of the traditional entrees are greasy.  This seems to be standard and typical with most buffets and small, divey chinese joints.  I tend to steer clear of these items as I enjoy fresher, lighter food ,and I found plenty of selection here.  Starting off with cucumber salad, seaweed salad (good if you like unusual flavors and textures), sushi, shrimp/squid entrees, grilled chicken w/ spicey chinese BBQ sauce, jasmine rice etc.   There were plenty of fried items if that's your thing which actually looked fairly appetizing and the desert selection seemed very adequate.

I'm sorry to hear about the previous reviewer's experience at this NNY.  I"ve had nothing but very positive dining experiences at all of the locations I've tried (especially WestGate).  This location is literally around the corner from my house, however, I've only been here about 5-6 times in the four years I've lived here...I just don't generally head towards Power Rd, I go in the other direction towards San Tan Village.  So, I have a cold and haven't eaten all day and I'm starving for real food.  NO SALADS!  This place seems to hit mark with sandwiches, so I order the Roast Beef BBQ Sliders with steak fries ($6.99)....they are positively delicious!  Three melt-in-your-mouth buns loaded with freshly shaved roast beef and topped with a tangy BBQ sauce.  I'm more than satisfied, but don't miss the grease of regular sliders.  The steak fries are perfectly fried and salted (gosh, I love fried food!) and completely compliment the sliders.  My dining companion orders the Torpedo sandwich which is served open faced with italian dressing.  He devours it, so I can only assume that it's really good.  I glanced at their Happy Hour menu which offers $2 beers and $3-4 appetizers M-F from 3-7, I'll have to check it out!

In the Raw is just a great place to take my Golden Retriever on a nice, sunny Sunday afternoon.  We stopped by today after a long walk around the lake across the street.   They have a nice little courtyard/patio with a fountain...it's very relaxing.   Chloe enjoyed a bowl of ice water along with some carob/peanut butter Yappy Yogurt and six Mutt Muffins :)  She was in doggie heaven!  They have a variety of beverages and smoothies, sandwiches, bagels, muffins etc.    Right next store is a Subway, so my boyfriend and I enjoyed our lunch while our dog enjoyed her treats.  Overall, it's a nice place to just hang out.

As a former Bay Area resident, I have come to love and appreicate all asian food. Generally, I prefer Japanese and Thai over Chinese, however, when it comes to Iron Chef it's my favorite.  The location is perfect as it's only a quick two or three minute drive from my house.  Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant.  The quality of the meat, fish and vegetables is just excellent and it's always very consistent.  I generally order the garlic chicken as I love spicy food!  It's a wonderful mix of vegetables and white meat and the sauce is perfect, full of flavor and not at all greasy.  I also like the fact that they offer brown rice as an option and their eggrolls are some of the best I've tasted.    The family meal for $29.95 is an excellent value and is enough food for four or five people.   We ordered it for the two of us and had leftovers for a week!  It includes sweet/sour pork, broccoli beef, orange chicken, chow mein, fried rice, steamed rice, soup and eggrolls.    I sure hope that Iron Chef survives the recession.  I try to eat there as often as I can :)

I've had lunch here three times now.  The first couple times, I would have given it three stars, but the third time is definitely NOT a charm.  I'm giving it one star based on the completely inedible BBQ chicken and long wait.  This must be the leftover s*** chicken that no other restaurant wanted to purchase.     For a completely fattening, cholesterol laden meal, I would like to enjoy SOME level of flavor other than lard.  I calcuated the approximate number of calories (based on nutritional information from another fast food Hawaiiian restaurant with a nearly identicial menu) for a Chicken Katsu "plate lunch" to be a whopping 1,800 calories (1,200 for the chicken and 600 for two scoops of macaroni "salad" and one scoop of rice).  Gross.

A big "thank you" to Rand H. for being so diligent about reviewing buffets in the area.  I was anxious to try this restaurant, so I stopped in for lunch the other day.  It has an extremely nice atmosphere, more upscale than your average chinese buffet and seemed very clean.  The food selection is certainly impressive and I wasn't sure where to begin.  I started off with several salads including cucumber/tomato/onion, seaweed, calamari, edamame and peel and eat shrimp.  Everything tasted extremely fresh and delicious.  My next go round included miso soup (perfect), fried calmari, several different types of sushi (excellent), szechwan eggplant, stir fried chinese veggies and spicy tofu with mushrooms and peas.  Again, everything was very good.  I wanted to keep eating, but I was determined to exercise discipline.  I was really too full, even for dessert where I observed a variety of ice creams (scoop your own from the cartons).    Overall, it was a great dining experience and the service was top notch.  With tax and tip it was $11.00 for lunch.  I hate to sound cheap (which I am) but this felt like a couple dollars more than it should have been.  I, personally did not need so many selections since I tend to avoid the regular greasy chinese entrees (orange/sesame chicken, sweet & sour pork etc.).  I would, however, like to try it for dinner in order to sample some more seafood selections

I just don't get the mediocre reviews of this place.  Yes, it's a chain, but it's a unique one at that.  I've never had a bad meal here.  I generally stick with the asian entrees and have never been disappointed.  This lunch was especially good and the service was excellent.  We ordered:  - Thai-High Sweet & Zesty Chicken Salad - delicious - Wok Fired Sesame Ginger Chicken (noodles) - fabulous & a large portion - Side order of fries - seriously some of the best I had w/ both sea salt and pepper and perfectly fried  Overall, a great lunch....I'll be back for sure.

I can't believe that I lived less than ten minutes from Joe's for almost five years and ate here once...WTH?  I guess the location off Higley and Ray wasn't along my normal route, otherwise I would have been a regular for sure.  I'm spending the day with my Golden Retriever, Chloe Rose, so after a walk around the park and a stop off at the doggie juice bar for Mutt Muffins and Yappy Yogurt, I needed a decent spot for lunch that would allow the princess pooch to hang out with me.    The atmosphere at Joe's is really cool and very unique...it was portrayed well on the Food Network's "Triple D"  It's modern, kindof rustic and not Arizona at all.  Gotta love the TV playing cartoons and the Barbie Dolls/GI Joe figurines in the unisex restroom.    We ordered the signature BBQ chicken pizza (the bomb) and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich (one of the best I've ever had) which is HUGE....I ordered it on a multi-grain bun with blue cheese and "upgraded" to garlic fries which were to die for...seriously dripping with garlic and parmesean cheese.  I must also mention the pickles which were awesome...so fresh tasting since the cucumbers are locally grown.   I like that the condiments are self-serve along with the beverages.  I cannot wait to get back here for breakfast next weekend :)

Yes, I'm addicted to anything that ends in ***bertos, and although I'm not hispanic, I seem to have acquired a serious taste for this kind of food.   This was my first time here, and I was expecting a drive-thru as most of these places have but did not mind having to go inside to order.  It definitely has that cheap/fast/authentic mexican vibe with bright colors and a big picture menu.  The fact that I was the only white chick in the place made me feel confidant that I would not be disappointed.    I opted for the green chile burrito which was delicious...smaller chunks of pork than I'm used to with more of a kick than I was expecting and a perfectly hot and chewy tortilla.  Nice selections at the salsa bar and decent service.  Definitely a solid four stars.

I can't exactly review the food because we walked in, sat down and then perused the grill line and walked out.  I thought the size of the bowl was extremely small for the price and I just wasn't that impressed.  I've always loved YC's and appreciate that you can select your bowl size AND the price includes a drink.    I just didn't like the vibe here, maybe it was just me, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.

I love to grocery shop at Fresh & Easy and actually find myself looking for an excuse to stop by.  You cannot beat the 50% off food which generally has the best selection after 4:00pm.  I'm really watching my food budget and have been able to feed myself and another adult for around $300 per month and we eat like kings!  I have never really liked Trader Joes since they don't carry "regular" brands like Pepsi, Lays, etc. which is why I love F&E.  Some of the freshly prepared entrees are just OK, but I've never had any issue with the meat, fish produce, bread etc.  In fact, I would have to say that I've loved nearly everything I've tried.  Tonight I cooked a frozen entree of Jalapeno Chicken with rice, green beans and squash and it was excellent and at $2.50 for two good sized portions I could not have made it for the same price.   I also recommend the fresh salmon, sushi rolls, veggie chips and hummus.

Sometimes it's just the simpler things in life which stand out, and when I can enjoy a delicious lunch for under $5, I'm a happy girl :)  I LOVE this hamburger, and I generally don't eat red meat 99% of the time.  For I&O Burger, I am forced to make an exception with zero regret.  I recently read that some of the countries top chefs were polled as to their favorite fast food pick.  I&O Burger won hands down.  A single burger without cheese, grilled onions, substitute mustard for special sauce.....pure heaven!  And, this location has a nicely landscaped drive-thru...not sure why I noticed, but it was a pleasant wait for a perfectly prepared burger and fabulous fries.

I enjoyed a really good lunch here today thanks to a Living Social $20 gift certificate.  The only downside was that we had to order off the dinner menu and this was not indicated on the certificate. The place was completely full by 12:30, it has a nice ambiance, overall, and the service was pretty prompt and friendly.  Here's what we ordered:  - Spring rolls (non-fried, vietanmese style) - Very good and included two large rolls with peanut dipping sauce.  This appetizer is very light and healthy and almost reminds me of a seaweed salad  - Spicy noodles w/ pork - Very good and included more veggies (carrots, broccoli and cabbage) than Pad Thai, although I prefer the Pad Thai flavors over this particular sauce; also a good sized portion and plenty for two to share  - Coconut ice cream w/ fried bananas - DELICIOUS; this was decadent and an amazing combination of flavors; the fried bananas were light and fluffy (not greasy) and a perfect balance to the ice cream which had chunks of pineapple; my dining companion felt that it could have used more coconut  Overall, it was a great lunch and they even continued refilling our drinks as we sat there and talked for about two hours.

Another Filibertos near the homestead....score!!!  As stated in previous reviews, this is a newer location with very effecient service.  Just when I didn't think their glorious food could get any better, I tried a new burrito today, the ADOBADA is the bomb!!!!!  Tender chunks of marinated pork in a reddish spicey (and somewhat tangy) sauce, homemade guacamole and shredded cabbage wrapped in 36" of mexican goodness.    Now, where did I put the Tums?

You cannot beat the happy hour at Brio....the appetizers are seriously yummy, and $2.95 each works for me!  I met a friend this evening, we sat at the bar and had a fabulous time.  We ordered the Spicy Shrimp/Egglant (YUM!), Margharita Flatbread (light and good) and the Meatballs w/ Polenta (great but slightly salty) with two iced teas and a gin/tonic our bill was $21.00!  It was packed, as usual, great vibe, nice atmosphere, I really enjoy this place!  I have never had a bad experience here...for a chain restaurant, this place really is spot on with a nice, upscale feel.

This is my new favorite lunch spot!  Where else can you get at least two days worth of vegetable servings and overall quality/quantity/selection/value for the same price as a fast food value meal (ugh!)?  If you join "Club Veg" you get a 2 for 1 coupon emailed to you at least once every two weeks.  So, for two buffets and two drinks, it's $14.00 including tax...this place rocks!  My favorites include:  Won Ton Chicken Salad - YUM! Broccolli Salad - Healthy! Homemade Chicken Noodle soup w/ green onions on top -  The BOMB! Low-fat bran/orange/cranberry muffins w/ butter - Delicious! Hot brownie w/ non-fat chocolate/vanilla swirl yogurt, carmel/chocoloate sauce - Heaven!  The service at this location is always great.  I meet my girlfriend at the Desert Ridge location and we love it because we typicaly sit and talk for hours after having lunch on end and they never bother us.  I just love buffets in general, but most seem somewhat unhealthy.  This place is just a great healthy alternative....I can't wait for the next coupon to arrive in my email!

I had a great meal here today and decided to make it an early birthday lunch since I received an online 2 for 1 coupon.  This location never seems very crowded, and it was a beautiful day on the patio.  Our server was very bubbly and knowledgeable and gave us plenty of time to decide...we were in no rush and their menu is fairly extensive.  They do have a special Octoberfest menu which includes a variety of german entrees including bratwurst, frankfurters, schnitzel etc.  I felt like eating fairly healthy, so I had the blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich (see pics) with the cajun remoulade on the side.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the bun fresh and the garlic fries are amazing, smothered in fresh garlic and parsley!  I only had a few and my partner indulged in the rest.  He had the BBQ chicken pizza which has a nice kick from the Marzen BBQ sauce.   It's definitely a big serving for one person, but he was really hungry.  He started off with the house salad which looked delicious and includes bacon, egg and candied pecans.  I would definitely recommend this place....great food, solid value, excellent service and nice atmosphere.

I was really hungry for lunch and craving hummus...too bad that I wasn't able to eat here because  I was completely ignored by the hostess/cashier.  I wanted to place an order to go, stood looking at the menu, put it down, waited, and waited, and then she walked by and gave me a dirty look, WTF?  So, I walked out.    Plus, the hummus with grilled chicken appetizer is now over $8.00 when it used to be about $6.00....I understand inflation, but the timing seems off.   Take your money someplace else.  In the same shopping center is Filibertos and C&K Chinese Gourmet, both of which will actually serve you when you're hungry and ready to order.

I've always liked Kona Grill, especially for happy hour.  I think that both the Chandler and Scottsdale locations have a better "vibe" however, this is still one of the more happening places in Gilbert on Friday and Saturday nights.  I've never thought the food was worthy of five stars, however, I cannot really think of anything specific to complain about either.  Actually, my favorite thing about KG is the jellyfish light fixtures :)  We started out in the bar this afternoon, however, with the doors open, it was kind of chilly and although it was pre-happy hour, it was noisy and I felt very exposed sitting in the middle of the bar.  We decided to move to the restaurant side and sit in a booth which made for a much more comfortable and relaxing dining experience.  My friend ordered the Kona Cheeseburger with fries (the smaller 6 oz) which didn't look entirely special and the portion of fries seemed quite small.  He must have been really hungry as he wolfed it down with no complaints.  I had a hard time deciding what to order...I was hungry but not starving.  I noticed that they've changed their appetizers and no longer offer the giant onion rings :(  I opted for a fairly healthy option, the Sushi Combo ($11) which includes eight california rolls, and one each of salmon, tuna and shrimp.  The house salad (dressing on the side) was very fresh and tasty.  Overall, it was more filling than it looked and I really enjoyed it.  So, I will definitely be back to Kona, athough they certainly have competition in the immediate area.  Two of my favorites, Brio Tuscan Grill and The Keg are both great options depending on what I'm in the mood for...if it's sushi, then KG is the place.

I've really been in the mood for buffets lately, maybe it's hormones.  Anyway, this is a solid chinese/mongolian/sushi buffet that feels cleaner and somewhat fresher than many I've tried.  I actually avoid the regular chinese dishes which tend to be greasier and heavier that what I like.  For this place, I stick to the food that I can't get just anywhere including the oysters w/ jalepenos, peel and eat shrimp, cucumber salad, marinated calamari and a variety other interesting, not so common items like little dough balls filled with seaweed which are awesome, but I'm not sure what they're called.  Some of the standard appetizers are very good as well including the spring rolls and potstickers.  Actually, nothing I've tried here has not been good.  The hot and sour and egg drop soups are both very solid.    As far as the sushi selection, for an all you can eat buffet at $7.49 for lunch M-Sat, you cannot beat it.  There are at least 8-10 different types of rolls, nothing that will knock your socks off or compete with high end sushi joints, but very good for the money.  I've been getting a 15% off coupon in the mail every couple weeks, so with tax it's $6.89.  The service is always attentive and friendly.

I was in the mood for a good buffet and didn't feel like asian food.  Eagles Buffet at Casiono Arizona seemed like the obvious choice as I felt like "real food" and not just soup and salad, even though it's somewhat of a drive from the far SE valley.  I'm not a gambler, so I'm able to get in and out without being tempted to turn a $10 lunch into a $50 lunch.  I agree with the previous review that it really has a nice atmosphere, more like a dinner restaurant with dim lighting and cozy booths.  Although it's generally crowded at lunchtime, I've never felt uncomfortable as the buffet has a fairly spacious feel with the seating set apart from the buffet itself (similar to LV).  I generally go with a three course meal here including salads, entrees and desserts (trying as many as possible).  So today, here were my selections, all of which tasted superbly fresh and delicious.  Pics attached.  - Spinich salad w/ endive, mandarin oranges, gorgonzola and candied walnuts - grilled squash/zucchini - olive assortment - fresh veggies w/ blue cheese dressing - cornmeal crusted trout - halibut w/ cranberry apple chutney - rice w/ veggies (steamed not fried) - coucous salad w/ kidney beans - steamed green beans w/ squash, carrots and red peppers - key lime pie (just a taste) - cheesecake w/ candybar topping (same as above) - chocolate brownie w/ hot fudge and strawberry sauce (same as above)  It sounds like a ton of food, but since I avoided anything heavy or deep fried, it was not too bad.  Plus, I just tasted each of the three desserts, I just coudn't help myself.  Yes, I was full, but I'm already planning my next visit.

I had another fabulous lunch at the Eagles Buffet today.  I really enjoy the variety of selections here, I don't believe that it's ever been the same in all the times I've tried it.  For those of us who "try" to be more health conscious, you just cannot go wrong with two salad bars.  Today, the entrees and side dishes were more along the lines of comfort food and included the following:  BBQ Beef Brisket w/ Buns Cornmeal encrusted Trout/Sauteed Red Snapper Roasted Chicken & Pork Pepperoni Pizza Mashed potatoes/gravy Roasted Red Potatoes Macaroni & Cheese Baked Beans Sauteed green beans w/ red/green pepper and onion Jasmine rice w/ black beans and peppers (delicious) Clam chowder/Chicken & bean soup Black Bean & Chipotle prepared salad Baked potates w/ all the toppings  The service is always top notch and I just love the dark, cozy atmosphere, it almost reminds me of a steakhouse.  The desserts are just "to die for" here....I had the freshly baked apple and cranberry cobler and my dining companion had this super rich, ultra scrumptious chocoloate peanut butter pie.  We both rolled ourselves out of there and are having no dinner tonight!

I have to say that I've really never liked this place.  It was the "go to" spot for lunch at the Gainey Ranch location when I worked in that area, and I always dreaded it when my team suggested it.   It feels like an over-hyped, somewhat overpriced sandwich place that just doesn't hit the mark for me.  I'm not a big sandwich person anyway and their salads leave something to be desired. They are soaked in too much dressing, odd tasting chicken with a somewhat slimy texture and I don't like the set-up of their counter service.  My mom was in town and she likes PB, so we shared a southwest chicken sandwich on a ciabatta roll and a southwest ceasar salad, maybe too much "southwest" in one meal, but it all tasted over dressed and the bread was tasteless.  She looked at me and said "we should have gone to Y.C.'s Mongolian BBQ for the same price."  I would have to agree.  I would actually give it 2.5 stars because I have enjoyed the quiche muffin when I'm in the mood for a protein snack (and there are no better options) and my friend swears by the breakfast croissant sandwich.

I just had a to review another F&E because I freakin' love this store!  If I never go to Fry's or Bashas again, it will be too soon!  This is the ultimate grocery shopping experience...it's never crowded, they have a fabulous selection and variety, the prices ROCK, there are friendly, mature and helpful cashiers, and if you're hungry, there are free samples!  For those of us who are having to really watch our food budget, this place is the BOMB!  You just can't beat the marked down section...it's like a treasure hunt!  Try Wild Alaskan Salmon Burgers (2) for $.90, WTH?  Some of my new fav items include:  - Green chile sliced sourdough bread (sometimes marked down to $1.03 a loaf) - Indian appetizer platter with onion bihaly's (sp), vegetable samosas and cool cilantro yogurt dip ($5.99) - Big Kahuna Chardonnay and Shiraz ($2.99) - Veggie Chips ($2.19) - Thin crust frozen pepperoni pizza ($2.99)  And I just love that there is practically a F&E on every corner in the far SE valley.

I"m reviewing this based on Sunday lunch only since I have not experienced the nightlife here, but it sounds like a pretty happening place on Fri/Sat.  I had lunch here today with a girfriend and thought it would be more crowded in the bar for Sunday football, but it wasn't too packed.  We were hoping to catch up and chat, so the noise level with the music and high def sports made it a little bit challenging, but overall it's a cool atmosphere and has a good vibe.  I ordered the chicken burrito with black beans and rice ($9) and she had the cheese enchiladas with green sauce and rice/beans ($9).  I liked the presentation, both plates were very festive and nicely sized portions.  I ate half of mine and took the rest to go.  It was really good with nice chunks of shredded chicken breast mixed in with a pico de gallo type sauce.  The service was really good, and I'm looking forward to coming back for cocktails :)

OMG...Best buffet in the valley hands down!!!  Beats any LV buffet including Bellagio etc.  Go for lunch...$13.95 is a bargain for this culinary destination.  I've been here twice and have been beyond impressed with the overall freshness, selection and presentation.  Some highlights:  - Salad bar - the "bomb" based on overall taste, selection and freshness as mentioned above...artichoke hearts, marinated olives, gourmet cheeses, many delicious prepared salads etc.  - Chinese - fresh, hot and delicious!   Scallop lomein, duck spring rolls, potstickers, and several other hot delicious looking entrees  - Brick Oven Pizza - Spinach, mushroom & artichokes....need I say more?  - Stuffed Eggplant - didn't even have room for this Italian masterpiece...bummer!  - Desserts - same as above....every imaginable flavor of gelato and so much more!  I cannot wait to go back here!!!!

I've been wanting to try this place since moving to Chandler last month and especially after reading the reviews.  Ordered take out tonight and it was absolutely delicious!  They take "carbs" to a whole new level :)  The noodles stand on their own....you can absolutely tell that they are homemade.  The thick noodles (there are several varieties) with minced pork sauce have a wonderful savory flavor and include diced cabbage and green onions.  The egg rolls were just as delicious and even the chicken fried rice (I know, rice at a noodle place?) was perfectly prepared.  This will definitely be another "go to" spot in lovely Chandler :)

The best freaking tortilla I have ever had in my life, hands down!  Yes, I'm a ****bertos addict and just when I didn't think it couldn't get any better it did!!!  I just got back from Mexico and this is still the best burrito I have EVER HAD.  Adobada ROCKS!  I have seriously eaten at almost every dive mexican joint in the Phoenix area and will go out of my way to eat here from now on.    Great drive through service and the LARGE size red AND green sauces are the bomb!!!

I really like shopping at Sprouts!  Although I try to eat healthy for the most part, I have never really liked shopping at traditional health food stores.  I don't buy all of my groceries here, but generally stop in once a week to see what they have on sale.  It never feels very crowded, the store has a nice atmosphere and I've never had to wait in line very long.  Their produce is obviously excellent and the prices are almost always lower than Fry's.  I really like their meat section and the "manager specials" can be a really good deal.  They have this spicy chicken breakfast sausage (ground like chorizo) which is excellent mixed with eggs or in an omelet.   Their deli meat is also very fresh and delicious.  I love the southwestern turkey.   The bulk items are great as well, and I like being able to buy as much or little of something as I want.  Garlic sesame sticks...yum!  Overall, Sprouts is a great store.

I used to be a weekly lunch customer, but not as often now.  I was at CFS and after perusing the food court, I decided on Chipotle.  As much as I was craving a burrito, I wasn't up for the 1,200 calorie splurge.  So, I opted for the rice bol which was just as good and much lighter.  I noticed that they've raised their prices again....yes, I'm very price conscious these days.    Their rice is delish...love the lime and cilantro flavor, pinto beans, grilled chicken, corn and mild salsa, lettuce and sour cream on the side.  Nice sized portion which I'm fnishing off for dinner as we speak :)

I definitely agree that Yummy Buffet is worthy of five stars.  I've certainly eaten at my share of buffets and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here today!  It is extremely reasonable at $5.99 for lunch ($8.99 @ dinner) and with an additional 10% off coupon, the total was $11.78 for two buffets with no drinks.  The decor is very comfortable, pleasant and it seems extremely clean and well run.  Service is prompt and friendly.  I'm trying to watch what I eat right now, so I avoided many of the traditional entrees (ugh!) but there is certainly a very good variety along with the Mongolian grill.  My attempt at a "healthy" buffet experience included:  * Salad bar - romaine tossed w/ a light italian dressing, mushrooms, black olives, cucumber/tomato/red onion salad, fresh oysters  * Sauteed green beans (extremely fresh and delicious), sushi (no deep friend rolls), edamame, teriyaki beef on a stick, spring roll (I cheated)   *Vanilla frozen yogurt - really yummy....no pun intended :)  They also offer "to go" boxes for $5.99 at lunch and $6.99 at dinner...with a coupon it's a flat charge versus how they normally charge by the pound.
