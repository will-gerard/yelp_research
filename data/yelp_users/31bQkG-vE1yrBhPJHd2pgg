Never in all of the leagues my children have participated in or all of the companies I've worked for or planned an event for, have I ever encountered such an epic delay of goods. We ordered shirts and hats before our sons 1st game over a month & a half ago and just received shirts this Friday, hats are not even done & the boys only have 2 games left! What a colossal waste of money & time! Any other printer in town would have had these done in two weeks or less. Also apparently they came up with the pricing on THEIR items for those of us in the league then demanded more $$ after the order was placed! Stay away from this company! Call Embroaderme!!

I've done business with Jeff Lawson/Lawson Plumbing for the past 10yrs and he is my top referral! Always has the solution and never trying to convince me there's more that needs fixed!  Great prices, customer service, & response time!

Furrends are the ONLY people I trust my furrkids with! I have a large lab/retriever mix who's old and doesn't like water and Allie is the only person he will tolerate grooming him. I also have a tea cup shitzu that more often than not goes to Allie in a hot mess because my daughter doesn't brush her like she should, and Furrends makes her look like a show dog! The convenience of them coming to me is huge but the biggest pull is how much these girls love my pets like they were their own, all of the anxiety that my dogs and I both have is immediately gone when I hand them over!
