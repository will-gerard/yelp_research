Quaint little diner - a great example of kitschy 50s Americana. It's the sort of thing 5 & Diner tries to be, only more authentic. The menu is very simple and it's nothing you couldn't get elsewhere, but the food is very good. You didn't really come here for the food though, did you... no, you came here for the atmosphere...  I went during the summer and it was pretty hot inside the little box. There were some fans working overtime to help compensate, but with the cramped quarters, the dining area is pretty close to the stove.   You can tell that for the people that own and operate this joint, it's definitely a labor of love. It's such a warm and inviting place to go. I can see eating here once in awhile for the experience, but it's not the kind of place I could see myself eating regularly... maybe it's because I don't live in the neighborhood. People in walking distance would definitely become addicted to the place.   I really enjoyed the food here. There were funny little books available for us to read and there was a notebook where customers could draw in. The whole thing was something I'll always remember... fondly. You owe it to yourself to at least check this place out once.

Absolutely horrifying.  This is clearly where strippers go to die. Fat, old, bored, and heinous looking moms and meth-heads giving not-so-discreet handjobs to shifty patrons... nobody tipping at all (which begs the question, "why do they come to work?")... and an overwhelming cloud of depression and angst looming over the whole nasty parade.  The place was surprisingly active for a Wednesday afternoon. It took several minutes for my eyes to adjust to the darkness - I imagine keeping it so dark can only help given the sorry state of the girls. There's no VIP room that I could tell (unless you count the shabby bathrooms), but that didn't stop the shenanigans going on out in the open for my virgin eyes to see. There were definitely men being "gotten off" here which disgusted me to no end. I have no idea how much it costs, but it can't be terribly expensive (and yet it's surely too much).   Another possible "up-side" to this place (depending on your perspective) is that they will serve you an illegal amount of alcohol... the law be damned. This is perhaps another aid to help make the beasts on stage easier to stomach.   Speaking of stomachs, Eric was right - there were definitely some very pregnant ladies here. Kinda disturbing. My friend decided she wanted to get a dance from either the oldest girl or the fattest girl in the joint. The girl she picked put her mouth on my friend's vagina through her pants and did some sort of heavy breathing and moaning... my friend looked mortified and all she could do was let out some uncomfortable  panicked laughter. She was also groped and molested beyond her comfort levels.   Nothing in here was sexy at all - it's basically a really dark and moderately scary dive bar with a bunch of whores walking around with their ugly boobs out willing to do whatever for a few bucks. These girls clearly don't make much money (unless the special services pay well)... my friend and I would tip 5 bucks to the stage dancers (and their center stage is a joke) and they would thank us with a surprised look as though it had never happened before.   The seating looked like it was purchased from a conference hall at the Ramada Inn that was shut down 10 years ago and the girls looked like they wandered in off Van Buren 10 years ago. I suggest you stay away, however I can attest (as Eric P pointed out) that this was a source of some amazing comedy and laughter... hence the extra star.  Edit Dec 2014 -   I feel bad about saying "whores," "fat," "ugly boobs," "heinous looking," and "beasts." Those are ugly words and I wasn't raised to talk like that - I was just trying to be funny. Also, I regret not mentioning that someone brought in some shrimp cocktails in styrofoam cups to sell. Like, where the hell did they come from? He came in through the front door. The regulars and bartender acted like it was a normal thing for a dude to walk in off the street selling seafood in a dark, dank strip club.

This place COULD be cool, but the owners are meth heads and nobody cool goes there. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen anyone in there. It's usually empty when I drive by or stop in.   I don't like going there though even though it's really close to my house and it's "punk themed". Not really punk except for the fact that it's all beat up and shitty.

This bar is not for everyone, and its location leaves much to be desired... however, I can't help but love this place. It's a little bit of a trek for me, so I don't go very often - however, I do try to go as much as I can.   When smoking was allowed, this place was difficult to breathe in. Now it's much nicer. The food is delicious I think, but I've had friends tell me they weren't so pleased... most people I talk to though seem to like it. There are booths that seat about 5 people. The seats are high and make it somewhat private. The bar is huge and they have waitstaff, so it's fairly easy to get a drink usually. It's also seldom crowded which is nice.   They host their own free poker nights with prizes... there's also pool, darts, and plenty of televisions to watch soccer on. G&D could use a bit of a facelift, but it's holding up well. The waitresses and bartenders are pretty hot and look like they could be suicide girls. There's usually someone good looking in there - but no pressure to be good looking or dressed up yourself. It's very casual. The place has a bit of a punky edge to it - most of the regulars seem to be into that. If that's "your people" then you should go check it out. If these aren't your people and you want to check it out - don't feel intimidated... everyone there is pretty nice. I should also mention that there's lots of beer on tap and the mixed drinks are usually really strong.  I'm realizing now that I need to come up with a formula for my reviews so they are more uniform and aren't so chaotic. Basically, G&D is a good place to go for a British Pub experience in the valley, but it's really more of a neighborhood bar full of regulars than a hot spot. Totally worth checking out though.

This may not be the biggest, the best, the classiest, or have the best looking (or cleanest) girls, but of the strip clubs I've been to in Arizona, I've had the best time here. I've been here like three or four times and have only had a bad time once.  The girls know what they are doing here and they give great lap dances. The girls are usually relatively attractive (though some of them look a little methy) and quite friendly. This club can get pretty crowded - they definitely have too many chairs inside. It's not that bad though and you have to know that the crowded clubs are often crowded for a reason.   I'm starting to think that these small-medium sized clubs that aren't quite in the ghetto and not high-end are the best ones. Good atmosphere, free entry (with coupon), decent drinks, and a fun time.   I officially nominate this as the best place in town to get your face covered in stripper glitter so you can go home and get busted by your girlfriend or wife.

I love that Phoenix is a pizza mecca... people don't realize that our little melting pot is rife with premiere pizza joints. This is one of those places... You could chuck a rock from the front door and break the glass of one or two other pizza places, but you wouldn't be able to find anything else within walking distance worth eating....   The kid behind the counter was really nice and the slice I had was delicious... spicy pepperonis and tasty crust. My only gripe would be that it tasted a bit re-heated, but those of you familiar with pizza by the slice joints will probably enjoy that. I can't expect them to cook an entire fresh pizza for me just to eat one slice... especially in the mid-afternoon.   The place was clean and the bathroom was pretty nice. I'll be back.

The upstairs theater is nice enough. There are a few nice semi-upscale restaurants here. It's also got a really good swanky (and somewhat hidden) bar here.   So why only 2 stars? Well, because it smells like this is where all the diarrhea in the world goes to die... especially the parking structure. If you can escape the smell though, this is a nice spot for a date. The problem with that is when you go walk her to her car, you have to try and figure out how to have a good night kiss while your nose is telling your brain that you are swimming in a septic tank.  The new Waterfront mall corridor stinks like this as well. Maybe that's where the term "filthy rich" comes from. What do these people eat?

Swanky, hip, dark, loungy... perhaps a tad snobbish, but grounded enough to let you in with whatever shoes... I do always feel underdressed when I'm there though. This place has been pretty reliable for over a decade...

I suppose I never reviewed this place because there were already so many reviews. I'll start by saying that this place hovers between 3 and 4 stars for me. The food is good for the most part... I did have a bad this or that once or twice. Otherwise though, good fresh ingredients.   If you walk by a fish restaurant and it smells like fish, run away or you'll be doubled over the toilet that night or the following morning. The stronger the smell, the sicker you'll be. Zen hasn't ever smelled fishy when I've been there. A definite plus for me.  While they use good ingredients, I find they don't roll their sushi very tightly and it tends to fall apart on me. This probably depends on the chef that day/night. And speaking of that - this place depends entirely on when you go and what you're in to... At night and especially on weekends, this place is buzzing and it's difficult to get seated or move around. It's a popular spot. During the day, especially during the week, it's pretty chill and a solid choice for a good quiet lunch.   People come here at night for the bar atmosphere behind the partition... it often bleeds into the main dining room - and this place isn't that large. This sort of thing can ruin a quiet evening. Good suishi places tend to have a busy bar though, so you probably have come to expect such things.  I have to note that the bathroom is great - classy and clean. The whole place is clean and well decked out. The biggest complaint with this place really should be the space - it's very cramped. Even when it's empty, it feels small... not really a problem though unless it's full of people - at this point you'll feel right at home with the sushi as you'll be a little packed sardine.  The last time I ate here was a few days ago and I noticed the little specials card in that plastic stand that sits at every table smelled like a construction worker's arm pit. Don't ask me how I know what a construction worker's arm pit smells like or why I smelled the card - just know that it was totally rank. I had the waitress smell it and she agreed and promptly took it away for disposal.  My advice is to go here when it's not so busy and have your night out somewhere else.

Best strip club in Phoenix... no contest. Went here tonight after writing strip club reviews all day which sparked a debate among my friends - we decided to check it out since none of us had been here before. And why the fuck haven't we??   I'm pretty picky and I'll just say that every girl in here is good looking and has a good body. Even the least attractive girl here would be the best looking girl in most other clubs in town. Many of them are downright beautiful.  Cover was 8 bucks, there wasn't a drink minimum (but drinks were as pricey as any other club) and dances were 10 bucks... VIP was 20 bucks and wasn't terribly private, but it was nice. My girlfriend got some good dances and we spent our 80 bucks so quick we had to make another run to the ATM before we had even been there an hour.   The place has 3 stages and the girls have to rotate to all three which keeps them from being available for awhile and that's kind of a bummer. It's nice though because there's always something to look at. There are a LOT of girls here too, so you won't be sitting there forever waiting for someone to ask you if you want a dance. I was told that the management here was great too and most of the girls I talked to had worked at other clubs but found this one to be the best by far.   This place is a little more laid back than other clubs... the girls don't go crazy with the pole dancing - guess when you're hot you don't have to. At first I thought they were just looking bored, but when they come around to chat they light up. This place is more about mingling than watching a show.  Bourbon Street blows the doors off pretty much every club in town and even ones in Vegas. If you have the urge for flesh or out of town guests and just want a mellow time with some beautiful girls putting boobs in your face, definitely go here.

Consignment... fantastic. It's a step up from a used furniture store. It's two steps up from a thrift store or a pawn shop. It's three steps up from a garage sale. The prices reflect all of this, but it's still pretty reasonable.   Sellers - as long as you didn't buy the ugliest couch in the world and you didn't let your dogs hump on it, then it'll probably sell here. They will look at your furniture first before allowing you to bring it in so you aren't wasting anyone's time. You can even bring in a picture and a pillow if that's easier. In fact, you can even email a photo to them that they will go by.   If it sells, they will give you anywhere from 45 to 55 percent of the money collected. To find out if it has sold, you can call. For security reasons, they won't give out much information over the phone, so you must bring in your paperwork to even ask how much it sold for. This is pretty annoying and inconvenient - they should do email notifications at least - but you can go into any location to get this information at least.  I got the impression that they will let you set your own price, but typically they will price your items for you. Good. Compared to what you would probably get for them if you sold them yourself on your driveway, you're going to be happy (even when you realize you're only getting half the amount they set). They will also sometimes come pick up your items if you need help.   Buyers - the store is laid out pretty well and they seem to only take quality items that would sell, so you won't find a bunch of ugly donated junk. Some of the items are out of date, but still in good shape. You're probably not going to find some grossly under priced antique that you could flip at an auction, but if you need to fill up a room in your house - it's a good place to shop.   Weekends seem to be busy for them, so I imagine their stock changes constantly. You're going to be paying higher prices than you would at garage sales or thrift stores, but the prices here are flexible and you're definitely saving money over buying new.

I didn't spend quite enough time in here to give this a totally legit review, but when me and my friend walked in, it was darker than most clubs inside, the place was very small and very packed with creepers, and the girls didn't take their tops off. They just wore what looked like bikinis.   I just think if you go to a strip club, they should show you their boobs. Maybe they do and we just didn't stay long enough to see it, but until I see different this place gets a 1.

I finally went to Postino. It was only a matter of time.   It wasn't very busy for a Friday night, but I've tried to go here during the day a few times and gave up out of frustration due to the parking situation. It wasn't a problem last night.   The place is beautiful. I really like the decor and the layout. It's comfy and fancy without being too pretentious. It helped that it wasn't at all crowded and that the weather was perfect.   The service was friendly and VERY accomidating for both of our special needs ordering. I was impressed.   I went into this without reading any reviews or knowing much about the place other than that it exists and people like it. I have to be honest here - I wasn't that impressed with the food. It's a simple cafe menu, so perhaps I'm being too critical, but I just didn't love it. It was decent, but not my taste.   The food is good... I'm just not going to go out of my way to eat here. The wine was good though. Maybe they have a larger list somewhere, but the wine list I saw was pretty short - particularly for a wine cafe. Still... what we had was delicious.   My only other gripe was that it was a pretty spendy experience - even with a discount. I much prefer Kasimierz - which is probably an unfair thing to compare it to - but I do. Maybe My Florist would be more appropriate of a comparison, but I haven't been there in years. I think this place is great and has mass appeal... My not being totally on board with it probably says more about my taste than this place.  I would definitely eat and drink here again, and I would recommend it to friends and strangers.

I used to go here for lunch when I was in high school (forever ago). I've kept this as one of those places I still go to once in awhile. The food is still good. They have great subs and the people that own it are very nice. I haven't had their soups, but apparently they are the bomb. The seating is cheap and it's not a fancy affair. Just a good place to grab a bite at lunch.

I love how people review the airport... like you even have much of a choice if you want to come to Phoenix or leave here for somewhere too far to drive.   Airports in general suck - they always have. Since you-know-when, they've definitely kicked up the suck to a spectacular degree. I mean, I look back to pre-you-know-when days of flying as the good-old-days. I wish you could still meet people at the gates without a ticket. Hell, I wish you could get in the fucking airport without having to remove your shoes.   Honestly, I'm willing to risk the occasional plane hijack in exchange for being able to not feel personally violated just because I wanna travel. It seriously factors in to my decisions to travel - the flying... more specifically, the airport. If someone really wanted to - they could still easily take over a flight or kill people on a plane or even crash it into a building. It's probably easier to take over a plane today than it is to hijack a taxi cab or a bus or break into someone's house. And yet we agree to surrender our 4 ounces of shampoo and nail clippers - like I can fucking attack someone with nail clippers. Fuck you.  Sky Harbor is like any other airport. They have some decent bars and it can make for some interesting people watching. As many times as I've been to this airport to pick up or drop off, I still have anxiety about navigating around it - it's not that bad, but it still sucks. I'll say it's just slightly less obnoxious than waiting in line for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disneyland.   One time I was picking someone up - had them on the cell phone. They had their suitcase and were ready to meet me outside - I asked which side they wanted to meet me on and they said South, so I pulled up to the curb to wait for them to walk right out. It wasn't busy at all either, mind you. I was there for not even two seconds when some old fuck tells me to keep moving. I pointed to the door and said the person was coming out and he yelled at me to move along and drive around. He even put his hands on my car to tell me again - I said "fuck, fine... " and pulled forward. He comes to my door and says I tried to run him over and starts taking my license plate. What?! I wish I had run him over.   Anyway - this airport is just as annoying as all airports are... unless you know of one where they don't give you a cavity search when you want to go to Hawaii. I am honestly not worried at all about terrorists. I feel no safer and no less safe now than I did in 2000. I would feel just as safe if they let us bring samurai swords and shotguns on board. I can rest just fine knowing the guy next to me might have 4 ounces of hair gel rather than 3. I'm more worried about what kinds of lice and shit live inside the pillows and blankets on the planes (they rarely clean them just so you know - only when the plane is serviced if at all).  You don't need to xray my bag or boot up my laptop. I'm not hiding a switchblade or a bomb in my shoe. I don't care if anyone else is. If I die, I die. That's the risk I take. It's a miracle enough the fucking things stay in the sky considering Airlines let these things fly when they're held together by duct tape. I've tried to duct tape a pair of shoes and they didn't even last for 2 hours of light walking.  Hey, the events of you-know-when were tragic... whether you believe it was an inside job or a straight up act of anti-American hate-fueled terrorism, I think we've suffered enough already. I say we lighten up on it. More people have probably died from second hand smoke they inhaled while on routine red-eye business class flights than have ever died from hijackings.

I have lived here in the Valley forever, and I've been here at least a hundred times to see various punk rock shows over the years. Hollywood Alley is definitely a classic venue.  I went here last night to see a friend's band play. It had been probably a decade since my last visit. Walking in was a very familiar feeling - passing by the cloud of cigarette smoke in front of the door (yack) and past the door security. I recognized the high-back booths and the layout hasn't changed much at all.   Something was different though. It's clean now. It's actually decorated thoughtfully rather than just decorated with random band stickers. It's certainly not as legit as it once was, but it's nice now. It seems like it's more for grown-ups. Most dive bars seem to end up getting shittier and grosser over time, but this place is miles away from the dumpiness of the days of yore.   I probably wouldn't make a point to go here unless there was a band I wanted to see. That's mostly because of the location. As a bar, I think it's nice. Strong drinks, cool layout, comfy booths. I can't picture this place booking a solid band I would want to see, so it's gonna be a rare occasion that I'll come back. I do like it though and I'm glad to see it still around. Brought back some memories.

Not really worth the drive for me, but the food was pretty good. If you're in the area, you should check it out. They have a pretty basic and standard breakfast, but it's easy to fuck up standard and basic and they did a good job. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but I liked it.

The men's selection was pretty awful in my opinion - but of course, taste is subjective. The shoes are all stacked up on cardboard boxes turned shelving... I joked that "they're passing the savings on to us."   There are much better discount shoe emporiums out there as far as I'm concerned. I won't be going back. The girl I was with felt about the same, but she was also feeling pissy - so it could've been that. *shrug*

So... I'm begrudgingly re-posting this review since someone was a big ol' crybaby about one of the words in it and flagged it for removal. I've masked the word in question for sensitive eyes, but if you're curious - it rhymed with bunt or punt, and in England it would've been perfectly acceptable.   To be honest, this review was pretty lame anyway. However, I liked this place and it didn't have another review. I no longer have the girlfriend in question - and in retrospect, I should've hooked up with the lady behind the counter.  ____________________________________________________  Maybe I just like this place because the lady that worked here was flirting with me and kept saying how cute I am.   I have no reason to go to a jewelry store - to be honest, I don't like the idea of diamonds and wouldn't want to support that industry. My mother bought me a watch here as a graduation gift (14 years belated) and I went in to register the warranty. They were all super nice to me and I didn't feel like an unwelcome smelly hobo vagrant off the street like I do at most jewelry stores where the snotty ****s working there look down their noses at me because I'm not wearing an Affliction/Diesel DB uniform.  I stopped in again today because my girlfriend was getting tint put on her car and we had some time to kill. We were helped right away with no pressure and it seriously felt like we were being welcomed into someone's home and asked to stay for dinner. If you're an uggo, I can't guarantee you'll have the same experience because I think this lady was into me (and right in front of my girlfriend).  Anyway - this place is great... they're all really nice here and they have a nice looking selection of expensive men's watches. As I say, I'm not really big on jewelry, so I couldn't say if they have the coolest stuff. It seems alright and I'm sure they could get you something custom if you wanted it. Also not sure about the prices... they seem to be pretty much retail, but I get the feeling they would cut a deal if you wanted to haggle a little. I guess the prices are what you would expect given the location.

I'll start by admitting that I'm not the target demographic. Also, I didn't see this place called Ladyland - It looked like it was called Electric Couture. Anyway, they were having some sort of yard sale complete with Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man and a cheap looking vinyl sign crookedly held up with rope. It looked out of place to a humorous degree.  We wandered over and browsed the tables a little bit. There were a bunch of clothes out, but none of it really looked like it was on sale. It was as though they thought more people weren't shopping there because they didn't want to go inside with the air conditioning. It was like a tacky bizarre ghetto yard sale for rich idiots with more money than taste or sense.  Ok - well, before I get all descriptive and shit - I'll just leave you with this which I hope will explain my low ranking of this store... The first item I picked up to look at was a pair of cheap unbranded knockoff Converse All Stars (likely from China) with skulls painted on them (with a rubber stamp) priced at $250.00. That's two hundred and fifty dollars. This place can suck it.

Holy lord, this place has amazing breakfast burritos. Their bagels are good too. The crowd seems to be older - perhaps even senior. It's also not the coolest location ever. Still - if this is your neighborhood, this should be your bagel place. Beats the shit out of Einstein or Chompies. It's also worth a trip to check out their breakfast food. Actually - now that I mention it, I think I'm gonna hit it up this weekend.   I used to work at a bagel deli called Bagels De Lox - we had awesome bagels and sandwiches... I think if you have a clever name with "Lox" in it, you're probably good. This place rules.

I don't know how people can eat here. The food is all grease and fat. The grease in which they deep fry everything is 'off' I think - like they haven't changed it out since the 1980s... everything tastes the same and not in a good way. In fact, everything about this place is like a blast from the past - it's like walking into a museum featuring restaurant cliches from 25 years ago.  I felt dirty and greasy just walking into the joint. The entire place is covered in a layer of film that's neither sticky nor slimy, but truly disturbing. The smells emanating from this place both inside and out are all pretty offensive too.   The quality of the ingredients used is all very low. I wouldn't ever recommend coming here to eat. We sampled quite a few different items and they were all vile and made me both regret their consumption and consider regurgitation. The sliders were a joke - how do you make greasy bread? Fries are made more of oil than potato. Pizza puffs are basically a twist on a mozzarella stick only wetter and less healthy (however healthy deep fried cheese could be).    There was one saving grace though - the salads seem to be decent. I won't be returning though.

I've stayed in some of the worst roach infested seaside motels in California, and this was easily the worst hotel I've ever been in.   It's Las Vegas, so you really aren't going to spend a ton of time in your room... however, the ability to shower before you go out is sort of a big deal. The shower in our room wouldn't drain and quickly filled up with water. I tried taking a pen and cramming it down the drain to see if I could fix it - I pulled the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it.   The drain was plugged up with some bitch's entire weave or something... perhaps a dog. We called down to the front desk and were transferred to the wrong department, transferred to a voice mail, and hung up on twice before we were able to get them to send someone out.   They sent out two maintenance guys to fix it and they spent a half hour blowing air down the drain with a hand pump. This did nothing. They left saying it was still slow, but working a little better. It didn't. All it did was make us late.   It wasn't just the bathtub malfunction that was a problem... the place was disgusting. There was some sort of small turd near the entry. The vent in the bathroom looked like there was a 1000 year old dead rat inside. The air conditioner sounded like an asthmatic and the busted tile beneath it was covered in dirt. There were all sorts of stains all over the carpet and anything with a surface was covered in layers of old dirt... tops of door frames, mirrors, headboards, etc...   Every shower curtain ring was broken as well - it felt like some sort of joke - like we were on some sort of reality show... someone just wanted to see us crack.  Sadly... the room was 150 per night because we got there on a busy weekend I suppose. Other people online had reported paying in the 30s for their room. I wouldn't have felt right paying 30 any more than I felt right paying 150. I took pictures of everything and brought them downstairs in the morning to the manager who acted relatively nice. I showed her the pictures on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of cleaning staff who looked at them and shrugged at me dismissively.  In the end, they comped my room. They should've given us tickets to something or gambling money or offered a free night in one of their nicer suites. Had they done anything more than comped the room, I would've tried to be a little more understanding. As it stands though, they did not.   I paid nothing for this room in the end, and it damn near ruined my vacation. It's not worth it at 150, 90, 60, 30 dollars... not even zero.   If you're a college kid who is happy drinking Bud, your idea of 'ballin' is winning 50 cents in the penny slots, and you are in Vegas to throw televisions through windows and pee in the hallway... you have found your ideal hotel. For a cheap thrill, get in the elevator and ride it as high as it will go - you will fear for your life.  Fuck this place.

Caught Louis CK here last night...   Beautiful theater... absolutely stunning. It was clean, the staff was really nice, and parking was a breeze. The sound was great, the seats were comfy, and I can't really find anything to complain about. Truly one of the most gorgeous theaters I've seen - down to every detail - it's my new favorite... I love it.   L.O.V.E.  If you twisted my arm and forced me to complain - well, in the lobby where they were serving drinks, the line got a little excessive. It wasn't so bad really - but I tried both of the wine they were selling and I kinda hated them. This is more of a bit of advice for you to booze it up before you get there than it is a complaint. I can't recommend this place enough.

I have been here - numerous times.   I don't like it.   I have quite a few friends who dig this place and are always trying to get me to meet them there... fuck. I don't wanna... ever.   It's not that it's scary or anything - I feel pretty comfortable here usually. It's just that there's always something horribly stinky here - either inside or outside... It's either some person inside who hasn't washed - like ever, or it's like a broken sewage fermentation tank valve or something near the dirt lot you can sometimes park in.   That's another thing - I'm pretty paranoid and OCD anyway, so leaving my car behind to go inside here means I'll just be thinking about people smashing the windows and stealing the radio or something all night instead of enjoying myself.   I kinda feel about this place like I feel about the Rogue, except I don't hate it quite as much. Unless you're a regular here, you'll probably feel like you don't belong. It's somewhat of an "in-crowd" kind of place where being "out" is "in"... I don't know. I guess it's easy for me not to go here since it's kinda far. I hope when I do go there sometimes, they don't read this and decide to spit in my drink or put it in a glass they used to trap roaches until they died.

I'll be brief:  On the upside -  Great ingredients.  Great crust.  Flavorful pepperonis.  Awesome as cold leftover. Gooey cheese Knife and fork NY pizza Clean dining area Friendly staff  Downside -  Really greasy (had to de-grease with napkins) Plates at counter weren't all that clean - double check before you grab one. They should bring the pizzas out to you, but they don't.  It's a little less expensive than Z Pizza just down the street, and it's better as well. I'm actually craving it again. Phoenix has some of the best pizza in the country - this place isn't the best in town, but it's another prime example of great Phoenix pizza joints.

My windshield needed replacement. I've never had the glass coverage - I've also never had to replace a windshield before either. I figure it's usually about 200 bucks or so cash to replace a windshield, so it's only worth it to get the coverage if you break them all the time.   I got a recommendation from my insurance company to use this place. I got a good price (not the lowest I was quoted for the exact same thing, but I took the recommendation seriously) and they came out 2 days later. The installer was professional and polite, and he installed the new glass inside of 30 minutes.   So why the 2 stars? Well, it has to do with what I ordered, what I got, what I was invoiced for, the quality of the work, and the resolution of my complaint by the owner of the business.   I generally don't like trashing a local family business - I like to support them. I recognize my beef may be circumstantial as well. Still, I was disappointed, and I can't give a 4 or a 5 for that.  Basically, I called and spoke with a woman who was nice, but super chatty. At first she expressed to me that she was sick and "out of it" (TMI?) and went on about irrelevant matters. I managed to set an appointment and although there was a bit of confusion and a lot of discussion about the glass I was replacing, I was fairly sure she ordered the correct thing. She was also sort of wishy washy on whether or not they would cover chip repair for the first year (as I had been quoted by other companies).  The guy came out on time and pulled a windshield out of his truck that was a bit different from mine as it had a factory tint strip - which I had discussed at length on the phone with the salesperson is what I didn't have. I asked if it was the correct glass, and he looked at his paperwork and then pulled out another glass that was closer to what he was replacing on mine and said that the tinted one was for another customer.  After looking at it, I told him I'd rather have the glass with the tint, but he said it was for someone else. Later, when he handed me my invoice after the work had been done, it said tint strip right on my paperwork. When I got the owner of the company on the phone, he said that it was just entered wrong. I don't really accept this as a suitable answer, but I have no choice because I had described my windshield pretty clearly. Also because he said he wasn't going to replace it with another glass since this one is installed already and it works.  My other issue was a rubber/plastic strip side molding that had to be popped off and then put back on - when looking at the work, I noticed one side had a significant gap (thickness of another windshield) between this strip and the windshield, while the other side was flush. The strip was also a bit loose. I expressed that it would get tons of water and debris under there and that I was concerned it would leak. He said it happens all the time - sometimes you pop the clip back in and it never fits the same as factory. I begrudgingly let him leave with that answer, but moments later my regrets kicked in and I started making phone calls - especially when I saw that I was invoiced for glass with a tint strip.  The owner said he would look into the cost of replacing the strip and either pay for it himself or go half/half on it with me depending on how cheap it is. When he called me back, he said he would pay for the replacement and went into a long explanation of how clips work and how the adhesive he would use isn't very good. He flat out refused to replace the glass and put it on me that I got what I asked for... my contention was that the salesperson (the 22 years of experience expert on these things) didn't explain anything to me - All I asked for was that it looked factory. I expressed this several times.   The installer also left a big greasy hand print on my dashboard, but that wasn't too much of a pain in the ass to clean.   I suppose I would've liked for them to have been more willing to bend over backwards to make me happy because I was clearly not - even though the issues were uncommonly weird and not anyone's fault really. They are family owned I think, so that's a plus. There are so many choices for windshield repair. If it was my business, I would've been more willing to make sure my customer was happy. Especially in an industry that relies so heavily on word-of-mouth.   I can tell you that when I called around, SafeLite was about 50 bucks more expensive than every other quote, and the sales guy on the phone was a huge asshole (and I only talked to him for 3 minutes). My guess is they just are a network for various local glass companies and they charge a premium on top of their pricing. I'm not sure.  I can't fully endorse Universal because my experience was disappointing, but I can definitely recommend shopping around for a local family-run business. As of now, this is still unresolved. He offered me 25 bucks and to replace the clip, but said I'm out of luck on the windshield.

So the owner wrote a reply basically reiterating what I said in his own words. He then had this company listing "closed" - the company is not closed. This is still the same information on their website and their phones still work and they are still in business. He just didn't want to have his listing out there with a bad review.   A few clarifications - Yes, I wanted the same glass I had before - without a colored tint strip, but with the factory shade. The CSR over the phone when asked to describe the tint strip to me made it sound like it was just a piece of green film glued to a factory window. The windshield that arrived with the tint strip looked way better than described which is why I decided to change my mind.  The reason I didn't want him to come back the next day was because I didn't have the ability to schedule more time for it and I needed to get this done and over with. I freely admitted that me having windshield envy was more on me - my problem was how they handled things.   My invoice being wrong makes me feel like I was mischarged - especially since this place was more expensive than the other quotes I got. Also, the way they broke my clip during install and said "well, shit happens" didn't sit well with me. They offered to replace the clip, but the reason I didn't call them back was because of how they were shitty on the phone to me about the whole thing. He made it sound like "I'll replace the clip, but you're an asshole if you make me do it" so I just gave up trying to argue with them.  He also offered to kick me back a few bucks, but at that point it just felt like getting my angry thoughts off my chest was a better idea. My review was up for half a year before he responded, and he took the opportunity to respond publicly to my review rather than to actually ever call me back. If he truly gave a shit, he would've contacted me to find out if there was anything he could do to resolve the situation.  Don't believe what he's saying - he "closed" this business to try and hide my review of his company - he then had someone fake create a new listing for the business and gave it a fake 5 star review... Also - my insurance company didn't "highly" recommend them either - they gave me a list of people and I called a few.   I ran a business for years and I know what it's like. I've been yelping for years now as well, and I think over time I've gotten softer and more forgiving in my reviews - particularly in the last year. I'm not even going to drop this down to a 1 star even though this kinda pisses me off more that he would choose to act like he has a side to this story that I didn't represent (and I was pretty fair in calling myself out the parts that were my fault) rather than come to me and try to fix it.   By now I've already got a new chip in the windshield. Maybe I could have called him up and had him patch it - maybe he would've done it for free. Instead, I just took it to my dealership - the glass guy there was nice enough to fix it for free.

I dated this gypsy con artist chick for awhile who was from Bosnia. She took me here a few times and pretty much blew my mind. I had never had anything quite like it and she assured me it was authentic. From what I understand, you would be hard-pressed to find anything so authentic anywhere else in the US. She even knew the owner (at least I think she was the owner) pretty well.   As a tiny grocery store, they have some really fantastic items that I've never found elsewhere. From candy to cured meats, it's all pretty impressive. As a restaurant, the food is great. It's all very rich and pretty accessible for American palates. They serve Turkish coffee which is this pretty amazing mud.  Ambiance here is a little third world, but that's part of the experience. I felt pretty welcome, but I was being escorted by an insider. I have found it a little intimidating to return by myself (plus, it's just really kinda far), but as friendly as they are I can't imagine I'd be beaten and dragged into the back or anything... though I don't know why I just thought of that as a possibility. Hmm... I guess it's cuz there's a bit of a mafia vibe here. I can't explain it.

Edit: So on January 20th, this restaurant closed its doors after over 50 years of service. I just found out about this today because it's my birthday and I would usually go to Matta's on my birthday since it's my favorite place. Well, not this year apparently.  Fuck.  There is a Matta's Grill restaurant in Mesa, but I haven't been - I hear it's not the same. They are supposed to be opening the old restaurant at a new location at some point... in Mesa. I hope it's closer to me.   Anyway, at least I can still order their salsa online. The thing about this place that was so great is that most Mexican food places can't get it all right... if they have good beans, their salsa is shit. If they have good margaritas, they have awful guacamole. If the beef is awesome, the chicken sucks. There's always something missing... at Matta's, they did everything right... their salsa alone is enough reason to go there since I have yet to taste any salsa from another restaurant that is anything other than either nasty mildly hot bean mush or else totally bland diced veggies.   Matta's has a hearty fresh and reasonably hot salsa that is full of flavor. Aside from that, they have some of the best beans, guacamole, beef, and chicken in the valley... correction: had. It's also one of the few places I've been to where a simple cheese crisp is actually perfect and crispy - not just a nasty puddle of grease and crap melted cheese.  Anyway - in spite of the negative reviews, this place was fantastic and I really hope they reopen soon. The comments about it being trendy or just for white americans are absurd. It was quite the opposite of both of those assessments. There was never anything trendy about this place - if anything it was a little outdated. As for being mexican food for white americans - it was more flavorful than all of the authentic mexican cuisine I've had in my travels.  [End Edit] ______________________________________  Easily my favorite mexican food restaurant in the world. I've been eating here for over 15 years and I love this place to pieces. I buy cases of their salsa for use at home. I take girls here on dates only if I really really like them.  The seating and atmosphere isn't the best in the world, but it's appropriate and it doesn't really matter. The food is just so amazing. The customers are mostly mormon families with their 9 blonde kids or else elderly couples. It's not the most fun place to people watch, but the booths are private enough.  Just go eat there.

This year (2013) marks the 25th year for the festival. I've been a handful of times over the years. I don't necessarily like it, but I have respect for it. Years before LARPing was a thing and way before CosPlay was cool and mainstream, these dedicated medieval nerds, actors, and craftsmen have been putting down their 12-sided dies and crawling out of their parent's basements to create a fun, DIY handcrafted fantasy world piece by piece.  Every year it gets bigger and more detailed. They still manage to avoid corporate sponsorship and the price really hasn't climbed out of control since they started either. Many booths now have websites as well so you can also buy their goods online, and a few are even starting to get Square so you can pay by credit card. For years, this was a cash-only affair (and for the most part it still is). Taxes? Well, their plates and cups are closely inventoried now to help keep track of that and to keep them honest, but I get the feeling that a lot of this still flies under the radar.   You can still get your Steak on a Stake, giant fried fish, salted pretzels and bread bowls. The food here is actually pretty good. It's one consistent thing about this: always something good to eat. You'll see people walking around chomping on giant turkey legs and there's a place here that makes some of the best crepes I've ever had. There are a few artisan chocolate makers here as well.  Over the years, the use of "Huzzah!" has declined dramatically. You don't seem to hear it as often. It was always pretty much the iconic catchphrase of the fair. This weekend, I think I was the only person who said it (even though I was saying it ironically, since I was the only asshole saying it, I was the problem).   My lovely older sister has been into this since damn near the beginning. She has been attending mostly as a performer, and has met many of her closest friends through the event. I never had the appreciation for this that she did. She used to sing opera, so she loved making and wearing costumes and period dresses. This was a perfect fit for her. She still loves it to this day, and I'm sure every year she goes to at least one Renaissance festival somewhere if not in AZ.   I've only been a handful of times over the years, and I can't remember it ever being my idea to go. Still - I don't totally hate it or have a bad time.  Half the shops here sell things you would only buy to wear or bring the next time you come. The rest sell mostly impractical artisan crafts and trinkets. There are some sky chairs for the patio and some normal things you can buy, but not a lot. Any pair of shoes you buy here will not be something you could wear outside of a costume party. If you are into roleplaying, then definitely come here.   The shows they put on are funny and entertaining. The performers are good at what they do, and they have a fantastic time doing it. They also never seem to lose steam or energy. If you come to this fair in a bad mood, someone will be following you around trying to cheer you up or make fun of you.  Also - even though they hold this in February and March, it's too hot out there. Bring sunscreen. You'll see people walking around wearing long black leather trench coats with heavy chain-mail armor and swords and crap and wonder how they aren't dropping dead from the heat. The reason is because half the people you see are from Apache Junction and you don't understand just how acclimated they are to swamp cooler weather and living with swamp ass.   The question arises - is this good for kids? The answer is "sort of" - I mean, there is face painting, and kiddie rides that look barely safe, and plenty of entertainment that kids would enjoy, but then the shows can be raunchy, some of the attractions contain scenes of torture and most of what goes on here promotes violence. Also, half the girls walk around in period costume with their boobs pushed up and almost bursting out.   Honestly, I don't really give a shit what your kids are exposed to - but if you are really uptight about it, then don't come here. Also, the ground is all gravel, so if you bring a stroller here, you're an idiot. It's a huge place too, so your little kid will get bored quick and also tired of walking around. Take them straight over to the petting zoo so they can pet some filthy goats and dogs and then come home with ringworm.   The bottom line is - if you've never done this, you really should. It's a top notch event. It's like a time-traveling low-budget circus with food and entertainment and a bunch of hand-made crap that you can buy. At least go and figure out that it's not your thing. They serve alcohol here too, so you can get drunk and belligerent and everyone will just think you're acting. You can wear street clothes or dress up. I'm sure it's more fun if you like to pretend and play dress up. Worst part is getting there and parking.

Diarrhea inducing shit food is what you'll find at Tacos Jalisco. It's pretty authentic if your idea of Mexican food is Rocky Point. It's dog turds... Rocky Point side of the road tacos are good only because you spent all weekend drinking nothing but beer and you're drunk... the reality is, it barely counts as food.  My roommate swears by it and eats there frequently, but I had trouble digesting it. He lived in Argentina for like a year, so maybe that's why he likes it. Plus, he is fluent in Spanish. It's the kind of place you would feel a lot more comfortable at if you spoke Spanish.   It seems to always be crowded. The tables are always dirty and it's hot and smelly inside. There are so so many good Mexican food restaurants in the valley - many that are authentic. This place is benefiting from the location because it is right on the edge of little Mexico in south Scottsdale. It's seriously dump though - terrible food made from garbage ingredients. Best thing I can say about it is that it's cheap.

In light of the recent news and video of a Dos Gringos bouncer punching a patron in the face, I thought I should ring in on this establishment....  This bar treats its customers like they are college kids. I suppose they are somewhat justified in this since it is typically a younger crowd. I've had mixed experiences coming here... in the past, I've had acceptable and decent service here, but the last several times I've been there the service has gotten progressively worse. On the last occasion, they took forever to take my drink order and then poured me the wrong drink... then when I went to politely return the full glass of whatever and get what I ordered, they refused to re-make it. I left it on the bar and they threw it away (keeping my money of course) and gave me a dirty look. I also had aggressive bar backs shove me out of the way.   That experience alone was enough for me to never go back, but it wasn't an isolated incident. It wasn't always that way though... The staff in general here all seem to be complete assholes, but I can almost recall a time when they were decent to me - back in the 1990s. It's a pity because this bar is in a great building and has a fun layout. It's breezy and open and conducive to having a good time drinking after work with your buddies. My old roommate used to hit this place often with his corporate pals and he loved the atmosphere. They do make their drinks pretty strong, so maybe he was too trashed to care about the bad service.   In their defense, their patrons are often rowdy, young, and unruly - so that's probably why it has evolved into this. I've found the Tempe location to be more laid back though, so it's still pretty excessive if you ask me. I have to give this place an extra star because it's still a good place for young folks to go grab a beer and chill. I think this punch in the face incident may get them to reevaluate their staff and maybe give them all sensitivity training or something. It can only get better from here.

Oh, sure I'll pay a cover to sit on couches found next to a dumpster and drink a diet soda. I'd love to. And can I have a shitty overpriced burger and greasy fries too? And can you fuck up my order and take forever to get it to me? Thanks! Oh - and please treat me like shit. I love that. You're the best Mickey's  Seriously - fuck this place. It's full of all the south-scottsdale douchefucks that are too cool to go grab a slice of pizza or a cheesesteak or a taco. People who aren't quite ready to go home yet, and still want to be seen and pay cover charges to get in somewhere so they feel exclusive and hip.   It's not the dirtiest place in town or anything... and it's kinda cool the first few times you go... a unique little after hours burger joint that isn't Denny's or fast food. It's nowhere near being cool like Mel's Drive-in in Hollywood though and once the 'new' wears off for you, you'll realize it's just a dump full of drunk people.  There's always some drunk idiot that hops over the fence/wall and gets thrown out. There's always people looking for that last minute hookup they couldn't find at the bars so they don't go home empty handed. It's not safe to be driving near this place because people think a grilled cheese will help them pass a breathalyzer. The people who work there treat everyone like garbage assuming everyone is a drunk idiot and won't notice. It's aggrivating if you're not so drunk you won't notice. The girls that work here are hot, but honestly you couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting a hot girl in Scottsdale... so what.  I want to give this place a 2.5 (but that's not an option)... it's not a horrible place to go and sometimes I've been glad it's there... Mickey's just isn't as great as everyone makes it out to be.

It seems like you can't close your eyes and swing a dead cat without hitting a Gilbert Ortega Gallery in Downtown Scottsdale. This type of stuff isn't my taste, but I think a lot of people must really dig it for there to be so many of them. I don't know enough about whether or not they exploit Native American culture, but seriously - how many fucking stores do we need to sell kachina dolls, quartz belt buckles and ugly aztec-looking rugs?  Gilbert Ortega is probably more like a one-stop-shop - an anchor store... Wal-Mart with Nordstrom prices. It's not like stopping at the four corners and buying authentic native crafts from actual native americans selling at the wooden trade shacks... this seems more like Native-inspired artwork and stuff. I'm sure it's legit if it says it is, it's just more professional looking and perhaps a little maufactured.  I've never found a single item I would want to buy from these stores... I've never even found anything I would want to aquire for free and stick in my house. I hate this kind of kitschy shit... I see it in a lot of North Scottsdale and P.V. homes and it makes me want to puke. My version of Arizona doesn't include this style. It should've exited with the 1990s.  This place lost one star because there are so many of these stores so close to each other I think they are somewhat of an eyesore. It loses another star just because what they sell is useless and tasteless and I'm simply not into that stuff - not to mention their prices are excessive.  This location also loses one more star for being built over a spot where they had to tear down one of my favorite eateries. When I was a kid, I remember my dad would take me to Main and Scottsdale once in awhile and we would grab a hot dog at this amazing little hot dog place. I've never had a dog that good since in my life and the fact that it's gone just makes me sad. It's one of the few good memories I have of my father who has since passed away.  Main and Scottsdale is a special corner and deserves to have something special built there... Gilbert Ortega isn't special. Though I do remember my dad used to wear quartz belt buckles back in the 70s and 80s and we did have a few horrible aztec rugs and runners in our house back then.  These places serve a purpose which is to provide tourists with a place to shop for souveniers or new locals with bad taste with a place to blow a lot of money on ugly furniture or statues. I think if you're a tourist visitng Arizona, then this is probably one of those places someone might suggest. New transplants looking to outfit their hideous cookie-cutter million dollar southwest spec home with gaudy sculptures and tacky furniture will spend a fortune here. Locals can simply do what most of us do - pretend it isn't even there.  (I originally reviewed this on 9/18/07, but edited it so much I thought I should re-up it to reset the ratings).

Location is great - tucked away and not in the midst of all the clubby scenester areas. The wine selection is pretty decent. The salads are awesome. The pizza is fantastic as well - light and artisan style with great ingredients. The best part is possibly the dessert - decadent and delicious. If you leave here and don't have the dolce, you're a crazy person.  This is a sweet spot to take a date or to meet someone for lunch instead of Oreganos. I like their wine list - particularly the reds. I've meant to pick some up to take home since they have a retail price as well.   This review is revised as of May 2008. Originally, I had reviewed this and talked about the owners splitting up and all that shit and I had given it a 4 star rating. I think I was feeling peer pressure with that score. I personally feel this is a great restaurant in a great area.

I used to live off this place. They cut their meats and cheeses fresh like a real deli, so already it kicks the shit out of Subway, Quiznos, and every other fast food deli chain that offers up pre-packaged meats. Their bread and cookies are fresh as well. For some reason, this location has better tasting food than any other Port-o-Subs I've been to. Don't know why.  There's always a long line at lunch, but it moves fast. There's some good people watching to be done here - cops eat here, firemen eat here, doctors and nurses eat here, and you also get the entire spectrum of downtown Scottsdale folk... sometimes you would think you arrived at a costume party or they are filming a new Village People video. I don't know what it is and I don't know that it matters either, but good looking people eat here. Whatever you want to make of that...   Most of the people that work here are really nice and competent. They keep this place pretty clean as well. Once I noticed some fruit flies buzzing around by the soda machine and was told they sometimes come with the fresh fruit they get for the smoothies (which are fantastic). Outside of that, I can't complain about this sub shop and I eat here all the time... it's almost just about as good as a non-chain place.

This place is loads of fun. Non-pretentious fun. There's always something cool going on here and nobody here is a fancypants asshole. Contests, games, entertainment, comedy, music, and strong drinks a-flowing... if you go here and have a bad time, it's your fault.

This place has been around for about as long as I have. Everybody's driven by it. Everybody knows what it is. This is the kind of place you went to when you turned 18 (or you tried to sneak in when you were still underage) so you could giggle with your friends. This is that place that usually has a random creepy abduction/rape van parked out front.  It gives off a dirty vibe. The dirty porn store. Driving by, you'll think it's just a cesspool of filth. Actually though, inside it's one of the nicer porn stores in the valley. I've been in here three times in my life... once when I was 18 or 19 with some friends, once in my early 20s with a girlfriend, and tonight with a friend. They always seem to keep this place pretty clean, and the staff has always been friendly.   Their selection of stuff seems pretty average. It's a small store, so don't expect to find some rare item. Just your standard assortment of porn and toys and lube and stuff. They do make good use of the space they have though. This place also has jerk rooms where I guess you can go watch porn and masturbate... I can't imagine using one of these rooms, but to each his own.   By the way, I don't know how I ended up writing so many reviews about porn stores and strip clubs... the amount of reviews is disproportionate to the amount of my patronage. Maybe one of these days I'll actually buy something.

This is a really neat place to see concerts and go to odd events. I've always loved the layout of this place - it's like stepping into a Disneyland set or something. Two stories of open space, the Venue is perhaps too large for its own good. The roof used to open up, but I'm told they had to shut it permanently due to building codes or some such nonsense.   The service here sucks and it's poorly run... events don't tend to go super-smooth either. Still, Venue acts as a bit of a chameleon because it can be all douchey and shine lights on your shoes to see if you pass the test letting you cue up outside so the vast place looks full (unlikely in a million years) and it can also be laid back and inviting.  Used to be called Cajun House and perhaps something else as well... while I'll say this place has gone downhill over the years - I've always had a decent time here in spite of its attempts to ruin my night.

Well holy crap. I just visited this place the other day and a lot has changed. I came back here to check reviews and found out that I was the first to review this place back in 2007. How about that?   Well, I'm glad to see I posted a solid rating back then and left room for improvement because let me tell you - they improved it... lots.  This is one of the most beautiful and unique places in the Valley. The current owners have clearly sunk a lot of money into the place to restore it to better than it's former glory. It's absolutely stunning inside. I walked around it during the day and I was awestruck. It's such a gorgeous spot with so much character.   Perhaps the best part about all of this is that the roof opens up again! It was forbidden for about a decade, but no longer.   They broke ground recently next door on what will end up being a swanky multi-story ultra lounge, and next to that they opened a new pizza joint - K.I.S.S. I'm anxious to give them a try.

I'm still trying to wrap my brain around what happened yesterday. This is technically my second time going to this event... the first time, I was with my girlfriend at the time. Neither of us could handle being there for more than a few minutes, so we got our entry fee refunded and ate at a Mexican food place nearby (which was pretty disgusting if I remember correctly).  This year, I was determined to check it out. I went with a few friends, and we wisely decided to get drunk before going.   The Scottsdale Culinary Festival is a misnomer... it's neither culinary, nor a festival. At least it's actually in Scottsdale. It's more like a parade of drunk douchebags. My friend spent the day giddily taking pictures of d-bag shirts and dumb hairstyles. It's very different seeing them outside of the clubs.   The food here was a joke... mostly chain restaurants. There wasn't anything culinary about it aside from the fact it was food. This city has some amazing unique restaurants, and it seemed like the sampling at the event wasn't representational of the kinds of fantastic "culinary" experiences one can have here.  There's nothing really festival about this either. It's definitely an event, but apart from security, port-a-pottys, "beer gardens," and wrist bands - it's just some boring food and drink.   My biggest problem with it is that you have to pay to get in, then you have to buy tickets so you can buy food and drink. They should just raise the price of admission, and have the food be free plus a drink ticket or two. I mean, this should be about restaurants showing off what they can do to get people interested in eating there.   The vendors at these booths all paid to be here. People pay to get in, and I'm sure the promoter makes a portion of the overall ticket sales. Whoever runs this thing is probably making bank off it. It's a huge sham when you think about it. Red Bull paid a ton to be there and have a premium spot - they weren't even giving their drinks away (which they often do at events like this).  Overall, it was a big joke - but we managed to have fun. It was interesting people-watching, but beyond that there wasn't any reason to come. If I had to do this totally sober, I would've been miserable.  Edit: After browsing the other reviews, it seems like I didn't completely understand the event. I wasn't aware proceeds went to charities, and I didn't see a lot of the restaurants other people listed. I guess at an event like this, everyone is going to have a different experience.

This place is fucking awful.   I haven't been here in about 10 years or so and I couldn't remember why... well, I went today and it all came back to me - vividly. I told my server it was my first time in 10 years and she immediately said "nothing has changed." Boy, was she right.  The food is a gloppy greasy gut grenade to begin with... The presentation is straight out of the 80's - huge portions of slop overcooked and swimming in an even more overcooked sea of diarrhea with some wilted iceberg lettuce plopped on top looking sad. It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen referred to as food.   All the food here is pre-cooked... meaning it is just sitting there over heat waiting for you to order it. I know this because you can't order anything special, like "no onions" in your shredded beef. The chicken was dry and clearly had been sitting on heat for several hours. It was completely vile.   We had also ordered a cheese crisp with ground beef... that was the description. It said nothing about veggies on it, but there they were - some pathetic overcooked hunks of unidentifiable veg trapped in the tar pit of cheap rubbery cheese and grey meat-esque vomit. It was sickening...   The decor of this place is a leftover relic clearly designed over 30 years ago by someone who was heavily into psychotropic drugs and Disneyland. That went along with the food which looked like it belonged in a museum (as my girlfriend suggested). The lighting in the room they stuck us in wasn't helping - it cast a blue hue from the skylights onto everything on the table making the food look even less appetizing. Aside from that though, it's kinda kitschy in both a fun way and a pathetic way.   I basically refused to eat anything from the menu (though I tasted some of my girlfriend's dish and the cheese crisp) and stuck to chips and salsa. The chips are the freshest thing sold here and aren't bad. The salsa isn't so bad either. We split a margarita just to sample it and decided it wasn't bad, but you could tell they put cheap tequila in it - beware of subsequent headaches.   It's a shame the food is so shitty because this place is in a great location. I can only recommend it for grabbing drinks with that hot GILF you found at the Yarn Barn before you take her back to her retirement community to bang.

This bar is a legit hidden treasure - the real deal. It's tucked away in old town and if you don't know what you're looking for, you won't find it.   I'll admit it had been many years since I came here, so I don't have a 'relationship' with this place. I went today though and was reminded how great it is. The same owners have had custody of it for well over 20 years and they took fantastic care of it. I asked one of the staffers about the owners and they pointed to the bar and sure enough, there they were... looking just like I remembered them from over a decade ago.  When I first was introduced to this bar, I'm not even sure if I was old enough to drink there - if so, barely... There was this awesome lady playing jazz on a piano and singing. I can't even describe how great it was or be sure how accurately my memory serves me. Even though it has been four years since they have had regular jazz music performed live, the legend of it lives on in spirit. All of the 'hip' and 'cool' pumped into this joint over the years still seeps out of the walls.   I had heard whispers and stories here and there that she died or committed suicide, but couldn't get a confirmation or denial from staff - just that they don't do jazz anymore. Bummer... I'm told they do have bands play sometimes though. Something I may have to investigate further, but I have my doubts about it being quite as cool.  Still, the place has a fantastic sprawling patio that spills out and blends with the surroundings... you can also wander up a staircase to chill out with a date near a fireplace in a small cozy spot with a view of rooftops and Camelback mountain. Inside isn't much bigger than a repurposed train car, but with all the windows and doors opened, the place is indoor/outdoor.   There were only a handful of people there when we went - they all seemed to be regulars and were pretty friendly. Having not been there in forever, I asked - apparently, they get a decent crowd on the weekends and it's mostly regulars - "industry" folk (meaning people who work in local restaurants and bars).   It's not some type of downtown douchebox that most bars try to be... there's an obvious lack of pretension and a cool breezy attitude. Perhaps part of it was how beautiful the day was this Sunday afternoon in March and that this watering hole is the perfect spot to chill out with a cold drink on some rocks.   A girl I was dating had introduced this place to me when I was about 20 - her little secret that she felt she could trust me enough to share. She loved the jazz lady and I remember going there with her to listen to music and we would chat with her between sets. Go check it out... you'll know within a few minutes if you love it or not. If so, then J Chew has chosen you.

Great atmosphere, good service by attractive people, good selection of wines, and a perfect place to chill and relax. This place is so comfortable... it's dark and full of comfy couches. Occasionally, there's an amazing jazz band that plays. The food is fantastic. You don't have to dress up to go here, but you'll probably want to. I love this place and have only been bummed out a couple times going there... once because of the douchebaggery that night and another time because the door guy was a bit of a dick. Both times though it was on a really busy night. Most of the time, it's one of the best places to go.

I've ordered delivery from this place, and I've also been inside the restaurant a few times and have met with the owner. They get 5 stars right off the bat for the simple fact that they deliver Mexican food to my house. That's a rarity in this town in and of itself, but the fact that the food was good was a bonus.   People get really picky about their Mexican food here - as they should. Arizona is lousy with Mexican food restaurants. I'm not going to go so far as to say it's the best I've ever had (I've had a lot of Mexican food from a lot of different places), but I will say that it's delicious and consistent. I mean, some of the best places to go get authentic Mexican food in the Valley are dirty little hole in the wall joints that you might be scared to go into. This place is clean and nice and quite a bit more upscale than that.   I wouldn't say the food here is inauthentic either. It's plenty authentic... that word means different things to different people anyway. Some think it means a similar experience to when they visited Rocky Point, and others will cite examples from when they visited Oaxaca or Cabo or Mazatlan, and yet others will compare your favorite place to a chain they like. Who knows. Good food is good food.   My experiences with the staff, management, and owner have been outstanding as well, and I will probably be eating here a lot.

Joe's is awesome. It's best as a late night munch after a night of clubbing and drinking and scamming (or whatever you do in that area), but they also deliver during the day. I have eaten at Joe's many times late at night, but today we had it delivered and thought I should finally review it. A full fresh pie is a little different from ordering a reheated slice at the counter, right?  The pizza is good for NY style. Nice flavors and decent ingredients. You get a lot of pizza for the money... particularly if you pick it up yourself - but 20 bucks delivered for an 18 inch one topping (including tip) isn't bad.   They were pretty nice when I called in my order which can be a bit of a contrast to the experience you get when you show up in person at 2am, but how else would they be expected to handle a line of hungry drunk clubtards going out the door? I was told 30 minutes (which would've been nice), but it took closer to an hour. I've worked pizza delivery when I was a kid and that kind of thing is understandable. No big deal. Now, if it happens every time I order from them, I might start to get bummed.  The pizza here isn't quite 5 star to me, but it's close.

This place has won New Times awards. I have never really been a huge fan. The pizza is average... a bit greasy actually. When I was younger, I worked at a video store nearby and we would often get lunch or dinner from here... it was definitely a creator of gut rot. I don't think we were able to eat there once without our stomachs regretting it later.  The people who work there range from being super nice and cool to downright sucking. I once had one of the girls who worked there start joking with me by making fun of me... it wasn't funny and when she noticed I wasn't appreciating the humor, she kept at it. I was pissed and had to go outside to wait for the pizza to be done.   It's probably the closest pizza joint to where I live and I eat there almost never if that tells you anything. I think other locations are probably better. Streets does have a distinctive flavor going on and it's worth checking out sometime if you haven't. Just bring some Tums with you.

When the Mobil station on Thomas and 68th street closed down, I lost my car service center. The guy that worked there was pretty cool and fixed all the little problems with my older car, but didn't charge me an arm and a leg. I was kinda sad to see it go. It was also the most convenient gas up place that was supposedly quality gas.  Anyway - the next time my car needed something, it was fairly major. I needed to find another service center. After some research and calling around, I settled on Marshall's. I found their labor to be quite cheap compared to other places and yet they used higher quality parts, so they were more than other places. It balanced out in the end, but I think I saved more money going to Marshall's.   I didn't feel like I was getting raped or whatever... they were really nice to me and invited me to call around and price shop and whatever else. They didn't do unnecessary repairs or suggest anything that the car didn't really need. I was pleased as punch actually. The reason I give it 4 instead of 5 though is because I sent a friend there (a female) and she said she didn't have the same experience I did.   I really don't think there are any auto repair places that earn 5 stars unless money is no object. It's always going to be a struggle between good value and quality work and parts. I think this place is pretty good though and I would send any of my friends to them. I ended up buying a newer car a few years ago, so I don't really go there anymore. The handful of times I did go there though, I can't complain.

Alterna-hipster bar with one pool table and one dart board. It's small and the customers are very much regulars. It can be intimidating to newbies, but don't be scared - everyone's pretty friendly. The jukebox plays old punk and rock. The bartenders are cool. The decor is really cool. It's easy to become a regular here and once you are, it'll feel like a second home. It's a good bar to go to after a night of clubbing to wind down and get the hipster stink off you. It's also a good place to start out the evening.  Parking is cramped and the video store owner next door is a cock, so don't park in his lot. I've been going there on and off for 12 years... I'd recommend it.

Ra is very easy sushi for the uninitiated. It's fairly reliable and tasty. It's not the best sushi in the world, but c'mon - this is Arizona. Sushi snobs/connoisseurs won't think much of this place.   The place is nice inside and the waitstaff is comprised of young and beautiful girls. The bar is a bit of a hot spot and the restaurant in general manages to stay busy most of the time. It seems to have a lot of 20-30somethings at the bar and high school girls in the main room. The older guys in the bar area look like they just got off work with the top buttons of their collared shirts undone, but their tans and physique suggest they put that look together.   The high school girls look like they took fashion and makeup tips from Paris Hilton and then doubled it... overdone and looking like they belong on some Mtv reality show. Think: modernized 80s Madonna. I imagine them going back to school the next day and bragging to their classmates how they went and had sushi at Ra thinking they are so adult. I wanted to choke those bitches out when I was in High School - nice to see nothing ever changes.  It's a good place to take someone who hasn't ever really tried sushi before or people who are scared of sushi. I like to eat here because it's close and simple. I haven't really had a bad experience yet. Sushi lovers/experts might want to steer clear.

Went during the day yesterday and was reminded why I don't do that more often. The lunch special was cheap, but shrimp and whitefish lacked the whitefish and was basically just deep fried slices of potato and carrot. The sushi was dogshit and the service was worse.   Getting menus was a chore, the edimame had no salt on it and when I asked for a side of salt, they brought me another shaker of table salt... what kind of place serves edimame and doesn't have sea salt or kosher salt? We drank a lot of saki bombers just to cope with the horrible food and service. Their saki smelled like nailpolish remover, but we couldn't tell when we mixed it with beer... anyway, it got the job done.  Every time I've tried to go here for dinner, they are packed and the wait is an hour. The staff is rude also. Silly me, I'm such an asshole for wanting to eat at your shitty restaurant.  As a sushi joint, this place blows - especially with so many better places within walking distance... including Ra (yes, Ra is better). On the other hand, as a tapanyaki restaurant, this place is pretty good. I suggest making reservations with a large group. It's not the best place for this either, but it's decent and conveniently located.  Kyoto has been around for ages and I've always recommended it to friends. Truth is, this place isn't so special. Never has been. It's possible to go here and have a great time and decent food, but there are more reliable places around.

I've eaten here twice now - both times with a small group (party of 5 once and a party of 12 or so last night). I've sampled more than a few dishes and I've decided that they earn about a 3.5 for food and service (which is a bump up from my original assessment). I've given them a 4 because of their ambiance - specifically the back patio.   First off - the food. Everyone likes to argue over what "authentic" mexican food is and people bitch about how this or that restaurant isn't authentic so it's not good. That's a bunch of horse shit. Mexico is largely a poor country (as well as being fairly large) and their affluent areas have cuisine influenced by Europe while the rest of the country varies wildly depending on the region.   Authentic Mexican food is a mixture of cheap and fresh and spicy. They use foods that absorb flavors well and they use whatever is available that they can afford. The spices originated out of a need to cover up the fact that you weren't eating the best cut of meat or whatever. Authentic Mexican food isn't even that good or particularly good for you - if you spent some time deep in Mexico, you would be shitting your intestines out 6 times a day for a month or two until you got used to it.  Anyway - The argument really annoys me. You want authentic, then you should go to one of those shitty diarrhea inducing taco stands that litter the valley and that are run by authentic illegal Mexicans and that are often getting shut down for serving cat meat or for too many health code violations. Everything is made with lard and/or comes from a giant can and/or is cooked in a vat. Authentic. Enjoy.  This place is as authentic as any except they thankfully probably use higher quality ingredients as do most places in the valley. I guess compared to other local joints claiming to be authentic - I'd say this is closer in flavor to what you might expect from a higher end restaurant in Mexico than Tee Pee or whatever.   I grade Mexican food places mainly on 3 things - their chips and salsa, their shredded beef, and their margaritas. I don't eat beans, so I try to ask a friend who does what they thought so I have some perspective on that. I also try to test out their chicken, cheese and guacamole on a second visit.   Frank and Lupe's chicken was flavorless as was their cheese... they put it in a mole sauce which was decent. Their Margaritas weren't very strong, but tasted okay - they gave me a headache and put me to sleep when I got home. The beef had too much 'stuff' in it and I wasn't happy when I ate that. Some places cook their beef in stuff for flavor and then just serve the beef while others cook the beef and then mix it with cooked veggies and stuff for flavor. I'm a fan of the former rather than the latter.   Their chips were decent, but nothing special. The salsa was pretty spicy (when we asked for the hot), but it didn't have as much flavor as I like. So basicaly I wasn't wowed by Frank and Lupe's - I just thought it was "ok." The service was decent - everyone was very nice, but be prepared to wait for a long time. This place doesn't do fast.   Going to the back patio here is really nice when the weather is good or on a cool evening. It's a great little spot and a solid choice for dinner or a group having drinks and snacks before going clubbing. It beats the shit out of Pink Taco and Tee Pee though.   Fun fact: they don't take reservations (so they say) if the party is smaller than 20.

This place is really popular and loved for a reason. It's consistently good and relatively unique. The restaurant is clean inside and the staff is nice and friendly. It's a great sit-down semi-upscale pizza restaurant. There's really nothing standard or conventional about the food here except that the pizzas are round and they are made of cheese, sauce, and bread.   I'm not as much of a fan of this place as most people seem to be, but I can't deny that it's delicious. It just barely gets a 4/5.

Yeah sure they make fresh quacamole at your table, but it's not very good. Same goes for the rest of the food. I've had better food at the roadside in Rocky Point. Their margaritas are flavorless and weak. The chips are bland and dry and their salsa is very American. The food is edible, but I don't think this place can qualify as mexican.  I don't eat beans, so I can't comment on the quality of theirs - they looked disgusting though (like all beans do). I had some soft tacos - it came as 3 tiny tacos with some flavorless bits of steak and cheese inside. The plate was covered in a mountain of rice and junk. Meh. I had 3 margaritas and couldn't even draw a buzz.  I'm surprised this place stays in business. Macayo's and Z Tejas and other chains are much better and they shouldn't be. I don't eat fast food anymore, but I'd seriously rather eat Taco Bell.   The people I ate with seemed to enjoy their meal, but they aren't very picky.

Not the most comfortable seats in town, but this place is great. If Yardhouse didn't exist, this would be one of the only places in town to get your imported beer fix. They have a huge selection of beers - better than Yardhouse actually... the only thing they don't have is 100 beers on tap. They do change out their tap selections every so often, so it's worth frequenting for the beer connoisseur.  They have some really tasty food as well... beer bites and sliders and pizza on the top of the list. They have a good jukebox, darts and a bunch of board games and whatnot. It's a fun place to go with friends... it's not always really loud either so you can have a conversation. They sell some wines as well as a multitude of fantastic imported beers from around the world in bottles from glass-front refrigerated display cases. You can basically use this as a liquor store if you don't have time to stay.   This place does also function as a brewery as the name suggests... they make some good ones too. I much prefer this place to Four Peaks - by a mile... They sometimes do promotions and raffles which is fun. Locals and regulars hang out here, but they aren't too territorial.   The service is probably one of the only shortcomings of this place... it's not that they have bad service, it's just that it's difficult to get any sometimes... particularly when it's busy. They can't seem to keep up sometimes - it's hit or miss. The people that work here are pretty cool though, so most people just overlook this.

This place has fantastic food at reasonable prices, incredibly friendly and attentive service, and a great atmosphere that lies somewhere between comfy cozy casual to romantic and classy.   So why the hell is this place so empty??  I'm sure it has some busy nights, but when I've gone there's hardly anyone in there. Perhaps it's just a well-kept secret. Or maybe people just forget it's there. Or it could be just that I've only gone there on off hours.  I do have a few ideas actually - and this could explain the 4 star reviews instead of 5. The food is very rich and the portions are huge. It's almost old fashioned cuisine. Everything I've had has been awesome, but I think they could get a little more modern with some of their dishes... although they do offer some good contemporary or at least unique stuff.  It's also pretty dark in there - I would definitely bring dates here (if I was single) for the intimacy, but not everyone likes to eat in such a dark restaurant. This is also a little old-school. I guess that's it - that's the only thing I can find fault with here. Otherwise, it's got a cool patio and a great bar, the kitchen is open until midnight and it's just an all-around solid place to hang out.

Okay - I've been going here fairly regularly and I've upgraded this to a 5 star place. The food is awesome and the people here are rad. It's one of my new favorites. I don't know what I was thinking giving it a 4. I'm stupid.  This place ranges from quite busy to comfortably laid back as it turns out. It's always an easy place to go though.   As for the pronunciation, I used to say it like "Frasier's" instead of like it's spelled and then for some reason started saying it like it's spelled for the last few months. Tonight I asked the owner and he confirmed it was pronounced like Frasier's. I feel stupid yet again, but at least I've been sending people there.

I love BOP... Mostly for the food. I love eating here - it's slightly better than bar food and totally delicious... I've only felt ill after eating here a few times, but I can't necessarily blame the food for sure. I eat here regularly. Easily the best pub food around.  They took out one of the pool tables and gave it a recent coat of paint. It looks nice in there, but it won't really impress your friends. The bench seat cushions are blown out and some things about this place are starting to show signs of age.   There are always a lot of regulars there, but they won't bite. They are always friendly and like to strike up random conversations with strangers - the staff is super nice as well. The crowd there has filled the digital downloading jukebox with good tunes so there's a good selection of inexpensive songs and there's typically something either really good or really odd playing..   There is usually sports (soccer) or news or adult swim on the televisions, but they'll probably put it to whatever you like. It's a really low-key bar. Don't go here if you want to impress someone with your new $200 designer shirt. I think if this place starts getting packed with a shit crowd, it won't be as worth going.  It's not the most british joint in the valley and the drinks aren't super cheap, but it's so inviting when you don't feel like dealing with the cramped space of TT Roadhouse or you want some grub. Plus, they carry Diet 7-up - nobody else really does that. Just don't tell anyone else they have it because that's what I drink when I go there.

Smart & Final is a bit of an odd one. It's part normal grocery store, part bulk club store, and part restaurant supply store.   Now I'm not a huge fan of Costco or similar club stores... the prospect of having to pay a fee to shop somewhere annoys me on principle. Plus, every time I go I realize they simply don't carry what I like. "Oooh, great price on toothpaste - if I want to get a different kind than I normally get," or "Oooh sweet, they have a great price on soap... just not the scent I like." I don't know - I can either load up a cart with shit I don't actually want because it's cheap or I can pay more to get exactly what I want.   Smart & Final does have bulk items, but the prices are only marginally better than grocery store on most stuff. They do have some great deals, but don't expect to come here to save money. What they do offer is great quality stuff... in mass quantities. They carry "restaurant-quality" foods. I love the coffee they sell and some of their ready-to-cook stuff is fantastic (like Shrimp Scampi or raviolis)... plus, it's a great place to pick up household supplies.   If you're like me and you don't like to go shopping more than once a month and you also can't stand the idea of paying a membership fee to shop somewhere, this place is great. If you run a little restaurant or shop, this place is perfect. Also great for if you are planning on catering your own party. Snacks, pasta, fruit, bread, pie, gum, coffee, detergent, tp, serving trays, etc...   About that - if you are having a bunch of people over for a dinner party or a reception or something but you don't want to hire caterers, you can buy everything you need here for any style or taste.   The wine selection isn't that good, the prices aren't going to blow your mind, you do sign up for a card (though they don't spam you with junk mail), and they do lack in a few areas, but this place is worth checking out sometime and definitely worth checking out if you are hosting a party.  This place is a 3 and a half for me, but I'm going to go ahead and give it a 4 since we can't do half points.

They remodeled the place a few years ago - it still sucks. It's usually impossible to find parking. The bathrooms remind me of the "worst toilet in Scotland" from Trainspotting. The people that frequent this place are trying so hard to be different that they just end up being the same.   This place sprang from a need to have a place in Scottsdale where people could dance and not have to hang around Scottsdale douchebags and snobs and plastics... ironically, this place has become full of a new breed of snobs and douchebags. There's no official dress code, but there is a dress code - you have to look like a fashion disaster or alterna-hipster with your "unique" uniform.  It's nearly impossible to get a drink unless you know someone or look like you know someone or perhaps have fucked someone who works there. It's the kind of place that belongs in Phoenix - it's conveniently located in Scottsdale though. I have friends who love this place, but I just think it's a shit-hole. I'm sure if I was still in College, I'd like it. I'm just too old for this kind of thing - not quite 'cool' enough. What's funny is that a year or so ago, it was more of a punky place.

On the Rocks is a divey bar in a strip mall "plaza" located next to a gun shop, a middle eastern grocery store, and what used to be The Congo. This place is scarier during the day than it is at night. It's actually only a little bit crummy to be fair - it has a few bar games and pool and places to sit and drink and it only smells a little bit like rotten fruit and B.O.  I don't really get the crowd here. Locals and burnouts mixed with some pretty cool looking folk. Hard to get a read on it, but I don't see this place being a huge draw for hipsters or anyone with a pulse.   Drinks are cheap and the staff seems pretty friendly. Even with all the video games, shuffle board and pool - if you wanted to have a really fun time here, you might have to bring your own fun... and at least a few friends to help you carry it.

You're going to go to whatever grocery store is closest to you, but usually you have 2 or 3 options within the same radius. If you live in the area, you should really consider making this your store. And here's why...  1. No member cards. Albertson's started doing member cards a few years ago much to my dismay... I protested and pissed and moaned because I knew what it meant... At the time, they were the last store to not have such a program and I would've gone miles out of my way to shop there for that reason alone. These savings cards are bullshit - first of all, they take personal info from you and use it to market to you and monitor what you buy. It's a privacy issue and a spam issue. Second, these fucking cards cost money - you really think you're saving anything? It costs them millions to launch such a campaign - they have to get that money somewhere. They get it by raising the prices of shit. I noticed it right away as soon as the cards were implimented. Even with the savings card, my groceries were more expensive than before. Fuck that. Anyway, they finally got rid of the cards again - so I love them again. Thank you Albertson's.  2. This place is a den of hot chicks.  Strippers, college students, hot nurses, and all sorts of sexy singles shop here. I've never seen such a hot group of 20-30somethings shopping for groceries in one place. Now, I shop later at night usually - but it doesn't seem to matter too much what time of day you go. It's a good looking crowd. Single people, take your carts and smash into someone you find attractive and strike up a conversation... ask some cutie if they know the best way to squeeze a melon (even though you thunk em, I think).  3. Selection...  this place has a decent selection of wine and organic products and produce and deli and whatever else. It's not the best store I've ever been to, but it's good. In fact, that's where that 5th star went - this place could be a little better if it was a little bigger or newer... Still, it's got everything I'm ever looking for which is all you can really ask for from a grocery store. They stopped carrying the bread I like and I had to ask a few times and submit a few cards, but they started carrying it again. So I can't help but like this store.   4. Prices... It doesn't have the best prices on everything, but for someone like me who doesn't do coupons, my grocery bill is smaller here than it is at Fry's with their savings card.   You can also get gas here and their gas isn't that bad. It's also normally pretty cheap. If you live in the area, give this shopping center a try...

Yet another bizarre little shop in the quirky Papago Plaza. Going along with the theme of generic non-clever naming - The Sub Shop fits right in with neighbors "Papago Brewery," "Beads," "Mail," "Tanning," and "Korean Restaurant"... I swear, it's like stepping into a movie set where they opt out of product placement or name dropping.   Anyway - going along with the name, this place has a pretty generic insides as well. It's definitely a sub shop. A place where you can get subs. Are they good? Yes... quite. The food all seems pretty fresh and you can bet it's healthier and of higher quality than the shit they shovel at Subway or the like. Generous with the meat - fresh sliced and priced to move as well. The bread has ranged from possibly day-old to squishy soft and fresh, but usually the latter.  Pricewise, it's a few bucks more than a chain that serves crap, but it's totally worth it. If you live in the neighborhood, I see no reason to not stop here for a bite. It's good. You'll forget it exists though... even if you write the name of the place down on a slip of paper and stick it to the fridge.  Edit: Been eating from here for lunch regularly - wanted to add - their prices are great, they always have fresh white bread, and the quality of their meats is fairly premium. Really tasty sandwich. Had to add a star... It's not super special or anything, but it's really good and reliable and inexpensive. What more could you ask for from an affordable lunch?

Fun hidden neighborhood bar with good food and relaxed atmosphere. This place has heaps of potential. I'm giving it a full 5 because my friend is a Karaoke host here and because the owner and staff are great. I didn't expect the food to be so good either. It manages to rise above simply "bar food." This place definitely caught me off guard.   This place is a bit of a throwback, but it manages to hang on to its loyal regulars. A few more visits and I'll be one of them... You may catch me here on Friday nights once in awhile singing alternative hits from the late 80s and early 90s.

Below is my original "review" - I had to say something about this place at the time even though I hadn't technically been there. Well, I've been there numerous times now. I'm in love. Here's my actual review followed by my original comments...  Fuck you Grand Orange, you pompous twat. Mama Mia's? I love you, but you've cocked up my order one too many times.  I realize that I can get a cheese steak that's nearly as tasty (but not nearly as healthy I'm sure) delivered from Philadelphia Sandwich company. I'm also aware that I can get one that's also rather tasty delivered from Mama Mia's... however, I think it's totally worth driving a mile or two to pick it up.   And it's not just a cheese steak - they have amazing pasta - had a fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was outstanding. Their cold subs are also fantastic. Dill pickles as well - they don't skimp. Their pasta salads are delicious as well (except I don't like peas - bleh).   Wine selection seems to be pretty good. In terms of varietals, they have a good range... the owner seems to be quite smart about his wines as well. Very nice staff anyway... except for my phone call tonight.   My only complaints would be that it takes a long time to get your food... not really such a bad thing I guess... but if you're on a time constraint - lunch hour or something - it'll be tight... call ahead. Prices aren't fantastic on some items either... although prices on many items are very reasonable. This is the sort of wonderful place that gives Scottsdale character and charm and contributes to it being one of the most "livable cities" in the US (or whatever the tag line is). Anyway, it helps one forget the douche flood. _____________________________________  I ate a cheesesteak based on Randy's review and I enjoyed it. The meat is better quality, but for some reason I prefer the philly sandwich company... just slightly. I feel healthier eating Defalco's though. I am going to have to try other items here before really giving a complete review. I think 4 stars is appropriate. Can't give it 5 since I don't know it well enough.   My roommate went upon my recommendation from reading about it here and he came back raving about it. He's from chicago and has been starving for a good deli.  I'll revise this review after more visits.

I spoke with the owner again - he's recently become aware of the reviews here. He even mentioned the one 3 star he got. They recently expanded into the store next door, so it's less crowded than it was before. They also added shelf space room for more wine. Great selection...   I still love this place. I still have yet to buy pizza fixings to make a fresh pie at home, but I will.

I wrote a review of this place back in mid-September and gave it only 3 stars... what the fuck was I thinking?   The food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. Amazing burgers. Their Diablo Chicken pasta dish is to die for. The cornbread is actually good - I fucking hate cornbread and yet I'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides.   As I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up.   The atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure.  Here's my old review for reference:   Great margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition.  It's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa.  Salsa sucks.  It's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. It could just be the times I was there though.

The service was pretty good when I went, but it wasn't very busy then either. I hear stories that the service is normally lousy though. The place is really hip and cool and the atmosphere is comfy and relaxing. It was a good experience overall really.   I'm not a vegan or vegetarian, so I don't have a reason to go here very often. They do accomidate the meat-eaters though, and they do it well. The food I had there was pretty delicious which is refreshing for a vegan-friendly place as most of them have terrible meatatarian cuisine. The vegan I went with was very picky and particular about her food and she regarded this as one of her favorite places to eat.  I'd say this is a great place to suggest for lunch if your group is a mix of vegan and carnivore. Something for everyone.

The sandwiches here are fantastic... seriously. This place would be 5 star except for the location being pretty ghetto and the novelty of the stoner theme wears off almost immediately. Still, a good sandwich place is a good sandwich place - this is very reliable grub...  I wish I was close enough for them to deliver.

As others have already said - great food, bad service...  The atmosphere is nice - work from local artists decorate the walls and seating is nice. Since they expanded into the neighbor space, it has gotten nicer I think.   The servers are all thin and hot and odd... they look like models in some sort of trance. I think they're in some sort of cult as well - it's apparently one of the tougher jobs to get since it's such a tight crew... and once you get it, you keep it for awhile. I've known a few people who worked there and they said the others were very tight and strange. I can imagine. When I was younger, I dreamed about dating one of the hot waitresses.  *sigh*  They are also somewhat spaced out and the service here is pretty bad more often than not. On the other hand - this place is often packed because it's so popular, so it's probably pretty difficult to be a server there since it's so busy. I tend to overlook the service being bad... it's not terrible. I mean, they aren't rude or anything and they're nice to look at.  Their tofu isn't always great and neither is their chicken, but most of the time everything is delicious. They carry a tasty selection of wines as well. I've eaten here hundreds of times over the past decade or so, and I doubt I'll stop eating there any time soon. It is among my top 10 places to eat in the valley for sure.

I don't understand all the one star reviews for this place. I mean, it's a 24 hour pizza delivery joint in the heart of ASU campus. It's a tasty traditional NY pie. It's perfect hangover food. They sell giant 32in pizzas and they deliver quite far. This is a family owned place, and they recently remodeled and changed up their menu.   Gus's has always been fast, reliable, and convenient. From the looks of things, they are always looking to improve as well. They aren't pretending to be fancy gourmet artisan pizza. At the same time, they aren't some huge chain. The owners are cool, and I prefer to buy local.  It can get a little crazy here after the bars close, but that shouldn't stop you from ordering delivery. There's a reason this place is swarming late nights and it isn't just because it's the only place open (because it isn't). When you've been out drinking, this stuff hits the spot like nothing else.   They have online ordering and great specials. If I were still in college, this would definitely be one of my main go-to places. It's probably more of a 4 instead of a 5, but I'm going with 5 for two reasons - it's a perfect example of this type of pizza joint, and it definitely deserves higher than a 2 star rating.

I thought I had reviewed this place before since my friend owns it, but I guess I haven't. I'll admit that I'm a meatetarian, so this place isn't for me - but WAIT! It is for me... this place aims to make vegan food that tastes more like what "normal" people are used to since most "normal" people can't stomach most vegan cuisine.  I'm one of these people that can't stomach it. I prefer my meat and cheese and gluten and whatever else vegans cringe at. Not everyone is cut out to be a vegan. Some vegans I know of are kinda fat - they get this way because with the restrictive diet, they end up loading up on carbs eating nothing but chips and bread and candy and bean burritos and pasta. I'm not going to argue on how healthy or unhealthy this lifestyle is, but I'll say that the food at Green isn't diet food. It's rich and flavorful and a good. It's a perfect place to go if you're a couple and only one of you is vegan.  I dated a vegan once... I'm used to normally being the picky eater, but holy shit. We couldn't eat anywhere due to her "diet" restrictions and it was terribly annoying. Eventually, I got her eating burgers and steaks and real food again. Before that, of the few restaurants we were allowed to eat at - this was one of my favorites.   The menu is creative and there's something for everyone (unless you're allergic to veggies and tofu). I dare say my friend is a culinary genius and I suggest you all check out That's a Wrap (his other restaurant) as well.

Why didn't I know about this place? I guess my friend Sarah has been hounding me to go here for years, but tonight was my first visit. Where's my time machine so I can go back and eat here more.  I was torn whether to give it a 4 or a 5... The decor is an afterthought - in fact, the restaurant part of it seems to be tacked on to an international foods market. The market side has some amazing foods you won't find in many other places around the Valley - definitely worth going out of your way to check out.   There were 3 of us, and we grabbed a table and sat down. It didn't take long to decide what we wanted - turns out we just about wanted a little bit of everything. The prices on the menu looked like they were from another time. I thought they gave us the old menus by accident. Let me put it this way - the prices were so low, I questioned the quality of the food I was about to eat...   We placed our order, and within a few minutes our table was filled with plates of beautiful food. This was as troubling as the prices - fast food prices and fast food service usually mean fast food and subsequent ring sting. Well, this is not the case. The food here was fantastic. I would say the food is a solid 4. It's not the best example of gyros and hummus etc that I've had, but it ranked quite high. It was delicious and flavorful, and everything seemed to be really fresh.   I cleaned my plate and picked at just about everything - we all shared a bit. Every mouthful was a treat. The service was more fast and efficient than it was friendly, but I never felt unwelcome. In a place like this, I'd rather have a no bullshit sort of experience. Just get this food into my bloodstream as expediently as possible. Really though, the service was plenty nice.   After we finished eating, we wandered around the market side and shopped a bit. We wanted to take so many things home with us - teas, sweets, spices, honey, and assorted unique items... We're definitely going back.   This is a divey hole-in-the-wall that deserves all the praise it is getting. If it turns out to be as reliable and consistent as I've heard it is, we're going to be regulars. If you twisted my arm to complain, I would say it is pretty inconveniently located (or extra convenient depending on from where and how you get there) - I just find it a bit of a pain in the ass trying to drive around and make turns on Apache since the Light Rail went live.   I can tell you this - if you're thinking of eating at Pita Jungle down the street - give this a shot instead. I still love Pita Jungle, but this wins on price and speed, ties on deliciousness, and only loses on decor. It's not a first date spot - it's more of a 4th date spot... impress her with the awesome and interesting eclectic hole in the wall joint.

This place is pretty neat... as a venue, it's got potential. There are a lot of vantage points to catch the show from. It's a great nook and cranny bar. The food is kinda greasy, but decent for bar food. The drinks are reasonably priced. The pool table area is well kept.  I have yet to have a really great time here. I think if they could land some really good bands here (read: bands I give a crap about), then it would be a different story. As others have pointed out - it's a little divey, but it's also pretty nice. I'm actually surprised I hadn't reviewed this sooner.   Fun Fact: this is sometimes a hangout for off-duty strippers... whatever that means to you.

The owners have been doing this for 35 years I'm told... they decided they are simply done with it. They plan to stay open for a couple more months - selling things off at big discounts.   This is a wonderful store and it's definitely a shame to be losing it. The store is filled to the rafters in old and new books. They also have a hodge podge of various trinkets and whatnot. You can get antique doorknobs here, random golf clubs or old 35mm cameras. It's somewhat of an antique shop, but mostly a book store.   Whether you have been there before or not, you really owe it to yourself to check it out. Even if you don't buy anything, just go. If you have been there before - go take one last look around... tell them you appreciate them.   Walking into the store is like getting hugged by grandma - go hug it back.

This place has been around for as long as I can remember and it has always sucked.   Earlier today, I had a conversation with one of my best friends about Buffalo Exchange and he went off on a stand-up comedy rant about it that had me and my girlfriend rolling on the floor as we listened on speakerphone.   He was saying things like "Buffalo Exchange? What's the 'exchange' part? I exchange an hour of my time for Elvira's dirty looks at my clothes?" I made him start a Yelp account just so he could review this place. I really hope he does - and other places as well. Anyway, I don't want to tread his material, so I'll keep this short...  There's something demoralizing about bringing your clothes in to Buffalo Exchange. They rarely take anything citing that it's not in style or season or whatever, and then you look around and the only stuff they have is more out of style than the shit you're trying to sell them.   Then you look at the person criticizing your clothes and it's some fashion disaster from the mid-90s. When they do take your 130 dollar jeans, they only give you like 4 bucks. They are complete assholes.  I've been to other locations - same story... with one exception - Long Beach. The Long Beach location rocks... well, haven't tried selling - but typically have a great selection to buy.   Just stay away from Tempe Buffalo Exchange - the sooner that place gets torn down and turned into modern urban condos the better... I would like to see Siouxie Sue get a real job somewhere - I can just see her at starbucks looking down her nose at her customers for ordering the wrong coffee.

I love me some good sandwiches, and this place has em. Small, family owned joint - it's easy to become a regular here - just go a few times and they'll treat you like one. Super friendly and nice here.   The food is fantastic. They use quality ingredients and cut the meat to order. Most places don't do this. The prices are low, and the food is good. The ambiance isn't fancy, but it's clean and quaint.   The Original Hoagie Shop has been here for awhile now I think, and it's a great alternative to the chain across the street. You're missing out if you haven't made this your go-to when you want a sub.   I'm definitely going back.

This is THE place to go if you want to hate on Scottsdale with your friends. It can get somewhat crowded and you'll find more elbow room outside on the expansive patio, but I've never seen it wall-to-wall people. This is pretty much a well-known fixture of downtown Tempe and it's frequented by all sorts of artsy cool-type people. It's not your typical college bar. It's also not really some sort of locals-only club.   I tend to get tired of going there easily because my friends who consider themselves too cool for Scottsdale always mention either that or Bikini Lounge or some other Central Phoenix hipster dive. I also find that most people are much younger than me... it's not as bad as a lot of bars near the campus, but it's still pretty obvious. That could just be that I'm getting too old to go out though. Perhaps I should just stay inside.   I mean, I agree with my friends who think Scottsdale is full of douchebags, but I staunchly disagree with their belief that there's nowhere cool to go in Scottsdale. Scottsdale is littered with awesome non-douchebag places to go. I guess that's beside the point... almost... I guess I just think that a lot of people from Phoenix and Tempe see Scottsdale as being full of snobs (Snobbsdale) apart from the douchebaggy scene. It seems like they are always saying how lame Scottsdale is because everyone sucks and blah blah, but that kind of attitude just sounds to me like reverse snobbery. Like "I'm too cool to hang in Scottsdale... " Whatever.  So Casey Moore's - it's basically an old reliable pub. Not the easiest place to get a drink at, but it's a cool place to chill and drink and talk with friends without having to yell over techno beats or top 40 hits. The upstairs is supposedly haunted and the owners are constantly pissing off the neighborhood residents because it's hard to find parking and people are noisy on the patio. Shit, I just realized someone else described the patio as "expansive" also - well, whatever - it is.   If someone says "hey, meet me in Tempe - where should we go?" Casey Moore's is probably going to top the list for lack of anything much cooler.

This is the QT that's walking distance from my house. My old QT was the one on Scottsdale Rd just North of the 202. I liked that one - it was clean, the staff was super friendly, and if you went late at night, it would be filled with gorgeous off-duty strippers (or maybe they were college students or hookers or just girls getting some gum before heading to the club - hard to tell).  This QT on Baseline though is a different story. Now I'm giving this a harsh rating because I LOVE QT, and with the exception of the one in North Phoenix that had a faulty pump cover my pants and fill my shoes with gasoline, I would rate them all a 4 or 5. So that's what I'm comparing it to. This one is pretty clean and sorta has everything you want when you want it, but the staff is short with customers and often kinda rude. Not the typical friendly attitude I've come to expect from QTs. Perhaps it's because this is near ASU and they are tired of dealing with kids? I don't know. Whatever the reason, they could be nicer here. They lose a star for this.  My other main complaint is that their ice is always melted. I've lived here for 9 months now, and every time I go in, the crushed ice is a solid block - like it melted a bit in transit and then froze back into a solid ice lump. That's useless to me. I have to drive to get ice elsewhere... and for that reason - because they make me drive when I could walk - they lose another star.   The third star loss is actually a problem at a lot of places around town... the windshield squeegee bins by the pumps are filled with dirty water rather than cleaning solution and water. I've yet to see it filled with anything other than filthy water. We live in a dusty State. We get dead bugs and cat footprints and tree sap and other stuff that doesn't just come off with dirty water and elbow grease. Throw some window cleaner in there like the fancy places do - like you're supposed to do.   Can't really take away another star for this, but it's pretty annoying that there's often someone smoking near the door - I've seen an employee smoking with a buddy out front once or twice as well. People smoke - not QTs fault. Wish they would smoke around back though.  Finally, I should mention that this QT is probably a 4 compared with most other convenience store chains, but it doesn't hold up to QT standards. Due to convenience and the quality of the gas, I will continue to get gas here, but I'll seldom go inside.

This is pretty much our regular place for Chinese since we moved to Tempe. Food comes out super fast and as far as I can tell, it's cooked to order. It has been one of the most reliable and consistent restaurants we've ever been (numerous times). They've been here for decades, so they should have it down by now.   Service has always been fast - we've sat down to eat, but usually we take it to go. When we dined in, service was attentive and good. The owner is usually who helps us, and he's super nice and fast - I don't think I've ever felt like I was "waiting."   The only real "complaint" one could lodge here is that the decor is a bit dated, but I don't come here to marvel at the wallpaper, I come to eat some amazing food. I'm too cowardly and set in my ways to order from the blue menu, and we pretty much always get the same things. We aren't terribly adventurous, but everything we've had has been fantastic.   There are a lot of choices in this part of town for Chinese food, and I'd say that this is easily one of the best if not THE best.

I'm not 100% sure this place is still in business... it's quite possible it isn't anymore. I know that I've been eating Pizza made by this family for like 25 years and I love it. It's literally the best pizza I've ever eaten. I know they have a location in Carefree - I'm not sure if it is run by the parents or the children, but it's likely to be good.  Originally it was located on Camelback and 42nd st and then it moved to this location. The family had kids that opened a location at Indian School and 46th street - the food was almost as good, but they closed down after a chain pizza place opened across the street.   This location in north scottsdale was always reliable and good. I loved it. Thick crusts and mountains of cheese and sauce... the sausage was fantastic as was the pepperoni. If this place is closed down - it might be worth a trek to Carefree...   If I find out it's closed, I'll update this review or move it over to the carefree location.

I think this family made the very first pizza I ever tasted. That's the story I'm going to stick with anyway (it was probably Chucky Cheese in reality). I have been a rabid fan of the pizzas they make for over 25 years.   I remember when they were on Camelback near 44th Street. As a kid, I remember being afraid to try it, but after some coaxing I became a huge fan. Then they moved to the Scottsdale and Shea location... I have most of my memories of it here. Their kids opened a spinoff location on Indian School and 46th, but that eventually closed - it was never quite the same (though it was similar). The Scottsdale and Shea location finally closed two years ago much to my dismay.  I only recently discovered this location way the hell up north. I'm glad to see them still making pizza (yeah, it's the same people - I recognized the chef/owner), and I'm even more glad to find that it's just the same as I remember. The crust is simple, the sauce is mild but plentiful, the cheese is gooey and high quality, and the toppings are fresh and delicious.   Everyone has their favorite pizza and this is mine. Nothing has changed about it in a quarter of a century. It's still awesome. I always get Sausage and Pepperoni in case you're wondering.  Aside from the quality of the food (which is amazing), the staff is nice. The interior needs a little work (it's kinda ugly - they should at least go back to the checkerboard tablecloths). The place kinda stinks too for some reason. It's not the food though... I don't know what the deal was with that. As soon as our pizza came, the smell went. Maybe someone ordered a stinky sandwich? Or maybe someone's colostomy bag needed to be emptied... I mean, the customers were a little on the silverhair side today. I'm sure it varies a lot.   I do love the food here - I wish they would move close to me.  Oh, and as has always been the case, the prices are pretty reasonable. It was less than 20 bucks for the two of us. Go check it out - definitely worth the trip.

I'm going to write this from the perspective of a couple. Went here with my girlfriend (who is very much into this sort of thing) on a Saturday evening. Largest club in the US or something like that, eh? Didn't really feel like it, but then again everything in Vegas is huge so it's difficult to tell what large is.   Speaking of large, the chunky asses and cottage cheese thighs on the majority of the dancers didn't sit well with us. There were so many girls though, it wasn't the worst thing about it. No... the worst thing was that we both had to pay the 30 dollar cover (because there was a male show there also).   Bear in mind that we're from Phoenix where the lapdances are of higher quality and than what we had at this joint and they cost half the price... cover is also free for women or 10 bucks for men where we are. Drinks at this place were disturbingly overpriced. We had what was apparently boxed wine at 12 bucks a glass. After 4 rounds, the waitress told us we should've gotten a bottle - cheapest one was 120 bucks (um... if you can pour 8 glasses of wine out of one bottle of wine you should change your name to Jesus and start up a magic show on the strip).  Also make note that we did a lot wrong that night... it was our first vegas strip club experience and didn't have the handbook. I'm sure there were cheaper ways to get drinks, but we didn't know about them.   Anyway - so the dancers weren't all that great for the most part. The worst part about that though was that even though we had a decent seat in a high traffic area, we got no attention. When we did get attention, I got shitty lapdances. They were so standard, I wanted to tell them to stop halfway through. In front of me, a group of dudes were getting the works - legs over the shoulder, panties moved around, allowed to be grabby. Me? no. My girlfriend got some pretty good ones though.  We were told by some that it was because we were a couple and that some girls don't like to dance for couples because they are afraid the girlfriend might freak out and get mad. Others said they thought I already was with a dancer... hmm...  Anyway - we had to ask the door guy at one point about it because we went an hour and a half without a girl even looking at us. He sent over the first chubby girl he could find... couldn't turn her down at that point.   As the night went on, we started to get more dances - we had to be aggressive in finding the girls though. Lapdances were still shit for me though. We finally found a girl we both fell in love with and who seemed to fall in love with us - so we took her to the VIP area... pricey and not as private as I imagined. We were told by several girls who tried to upsell us that we could do more up there - psh... not much more from a guy's point of view - but she did some naughty things to my girlfriend. It was a lot of fun at least.  Don't know if the whole experience was worth every penny, but we don't have much to compare it to since this is the only strip club we visited in Vegas. Next time we're doing more research.   We did find out that many dancers are from other states and just come out here on the weekends because they can make up to 2k a night... shit - a couple weekends or so a month and you could turn 6 figures a year easy. Now I understand a little why some of those girls were such stuck up bitches. Compared to the handful of clubs I've been to around Phoenix, I have to give the overall quality of the vegas local dancers a 2/5... we had a few who were just in from out of town who we liked a lot, but really we would only return to this club to try to find that VIP girl again. Otherwise we're never going back.  Kid Rock showed up that night too... still doesn't elevate this place above a 2 from a couple's perspective... judging from the experience the guys around us were having though - I'd have to give it more stars.

This is easily the best breakfast I've had in Vegas. It's better than buffets on the Strip, and cheaper. The French Toast was what cinched it. Best ever. The eggs I ordered were cooked perfectly as was the bacon. I tasted some biscuit and gravy off my fiancee's plate and it was outstanding as well. Coffee was meh. Decor is way dated and the place needs a remodel. The staff is very nice and attentive. Our server even went so far as to try to explain to us how to cook french toast that good. Instead of doing that though, we're just going to come back here next time we're in town.

I don't know exactly what to say about this place. I hated it - I know that for sure. I just can't put words together as to why.   I wasn't impressed with the guac - so what if some emo guy with horn rimmed glasses stabs at some avocados and other diced veggies with a spoon for 30 seconds? Is that supposed to make me piss myself with excitement? Anyway, it tasted pretty bland... and for $10.50, I think it should taste better. The chips that came with it were a little greasy, but okay.   Our entrees were about 15 bucks each and I almost laughed when they arrived... four tiny pathetic lukewarm soft tacos alone on a cold plate. It looked like something I could've bought on a street corner in Rocky Point for 2 bucks. We had the option of getting salads or fries with our tacos... FRIES. How is that Mexican? We had the salads which were okay...   They only had corn tortillas which I personally don't like. I had carne asada and my girlfriend had shrimp... the beef was pretty good - and the shrimp was okay. The cheese they put on our tacos was kinda gross. Neither of us were really impressed.   On top of that, the place was pretty loud... I guess it's understandable for a small crowded space. Maybe they could've used some acoustic panels or something. My table almost tipped over on me - I just never felt comfortable there at all. I actually felt so uncomfortable I forgot what stuff was - like I had to ask him to clarify what carne asada was (something I order and eat all the time). I just got all confused after looking through their menu. The server was fake nice to us, but I felt hated... we only saw him at the beginning and end of our meal... we kinda got ignored on the drink refills - I think it's cuz we weren't ordering booze (which they make a fortune on).  As food goes, this place is edible, but not good. It's nowhere near worth these prices. It's comparable to the Pink Taco, but slightly less douchey perhaps? Neither place is very authentic (or good). I asked what on the menu was spicy and he said 'nothing." They also only have one dish with rice - ONLY ONE - and it's just a special because they normally don't have any dishes with rice. What the hell is that?   I sometimes wonder why people like places like this... it's as though they just like it because the place is crowded and the food is expensive. It's just bland food. Overrated. Overpriced. This place can suck it - I won't be back.

The food sorta tasted okay, but it was made from horrible crappy ingredients. I couldn't finish because the cheese they used made me nauseous after a few bites. I just couldn't chew it anymore while thinking about what it was going to do to my insides. I felt like if I stuck some on my arm, it would be absorbed by my skin and instantly turned into fat and an artery clog.   Let me back up though - the parking lot is a crowded mess where you can pretty much assume your car is going to get dented by another car door. How about some wider spaces and one person has to park on the street? After that, you walk into a dark dungeon where a 9 month pregnant girl directs you through some sort of dark bar into some hideously decorated brighter room with booths stolen from an IHOP that burned down in the 80s.   The table and seats were filthy and greasy and if someone sits behind you, you share opposite sides of a seatback - which is a little too intimate for me...   The margaritas are small and not very powerful or particularly tasty or memorable. The food in general was pretty greasy. The chips and salsa were average. The prices were pretty steep considering what you're getting. The service was decent I suppose, but I felt like I was being served by scary grade school lunch ladies.   I won't be going back any time soon. I left more on my plate than I ate... I also left wanting to puke up what I did consume and start lunch over somewhere good. This food would've been appreciated a little more if the cost was about 1/3 of what it was. It still wouldn't have been good though.  This place seemed pretty authentic to me - it's not like authentic = good... Real Mexican food is shitty - cheap ingredients and too much grease and fat. It's an authentic shitty Mexican food restaurant. Go eat somewhere else.

I'm fairly certain I've had a good dining experience here, though I'd be hard pressed to come up with exactly when that was. I was here the other night, and it was pretty bad. Unfortunately, this result is more the rule than the exception for me. I swear this place is like the Tara Reid of restaurants.  The place is pretty nice... comfy chairs, loungy sofa style seating, lovely patio, clean and open dining area (with hideous gaudy bedazzled dog statues placed strategically so you can sit anywhere and see a faux diamond encrusted canine anus while you eat), and a nice long modern (for 10 years ago) bar. The exterior walls are mostly glass so if you're at all self conscious, you might feel like you're on display.   This was a mid-week night and it was pretty dead. There were literally more waitstaff than tables seated, yet the table next to us had one of their orders completely forgotten. Then the same waiter kept asking what we wanted to drink and while we were ordering, he would walk away for 10 minutes. The service didn't get much better from there. When we finally got to order and then eventually get our food, it was mediocre... definitely not worth the lofty prices. In fact, the burgers used to be considered quite good here - the burger hasn't changed much, but I guess maybe the bar has been raised since they designed theirs. This place just needs to revamp a little bit I think. They also need some new staff.  Like Tara Reid, this joint is an old diseased coked up used up whore that hangs out with the under/upper crust of society, can't act or even perform basic functions half the time, pretty much everyone has been inside at some point, half the people come to watch the train wreck while the other half comes to be on the train, and on the right nights is fun to party with.

Fashion Square is quite the success story. I don't actually know the entire story, but I know it's a success. It has done an amazing job of growing up with the surrounding area - eating up nearby shopping plazas and parking lots and expanding into the Mall of America of the South West.  It's really difficult to shit on this mall. It has everything a mall can offer and then some. There's not much to dislike. It manages to strike a balance between posh and down to earth that isn't terribly off-putting for the working class, but rest assured it's definitely heading towards being too high-end and exclusive. To top it off, this place isn't overrun by children. You know you're doing something right when you're a tourist destination. Considering the humble beginnings, this is quite an accomplishment.   My personal favorite part about this mall is that it's close to me. I also like the layout - even though it's massive, it's easy to navigate. The parking is pretty accommodating considering how much it has grown over the years. I've only had trouble on Black Friday or special events. Speaking of which, even though this place is a shopper's paradise, I seldom find anything to buy when searching for gifts. Maybe I'm cheap.  The restaurants here are great and even the inside food court has some choice spots. Much more interesting than the typical Taco Bell and McDonalds unhealthy choices offered at most malls. Nearby, the full restaurants offer great near-fine dining at mid-scale pricing. Z Tejas being a personal favorite (to the dismay of my waistline).  This mall attracts a deep pocket high-society crowd as well as pretenders. Some might find it irritating while others may appreciate the people-watching factor. Fashion Square continues to expand and deliver one of the best shopping experiences available. Its ability to stay relevant and modern over the years should keep it around for another 50 years. At this rate, by 2020, all of downtown Scottsdale should be part of the mall. Another 10 years after that and my house will be a Hollister.

Didn't like the salsa or the chips - and that's a pretty important component of Mexican food. They were kinda rude to us as well... although I will say they were attentive and informative. I guess it's just that they had us feeling like we weren't good enough to eat there. They were pretty strict about substitutions too - as in, they were against them. They don't seem to want to let you have flour tortillas instead of corn. Personally, I find corn tortillas to be quite vile.  Another staple they offer that wasn't very impressive was the margarita. It tasted like just a grocery store-bought mix that they stuck expensive tequilla in (if you pay extra - the standard issue is Cuervo). I had some tacos and they were good, but they didn't blow me away. They did end up agreeing to make them with flour tortillas, but as the dish was handed to me I was informed that they would never do it that way for me again. Huh? Wow, so I had a one of a kind meal.  My rating may be a little misleading because I think other people would like it more than I did. I think it's a nice environment - cute little restaurant inside, and great patio outside (that would be better when it's not so hot). I want to give this a 2.5, but can't and I don't consider this to be a 3... however, as you can see from the other reviews, I'm in the minority here.   I think I may be a little too fussy and cheap to eat here - I like my food simple and they over-complicate the dishes and over-charge for them. They won't let me substitute things (which is something you can't do to a fussy person) or even leave something off the dish. This indicates to me either a level of pretentiousness or some degree of incompetence... I think it's the former rather than the latter. The prices for the entrees are way too high for what you're getting. The value just isn't there for me. My friend says this is his favorite Mexican restaurant, so maybe this might be your kinda place.

Sadly, Eastside had to downsize and they squeezed everything into half the shop. It's sad too because they got jacked out of the better side. I've been coming here for 16 years and learned a lot about music and met a lot of cool people here. The owner is a great guy and even if they seem a little preoccupied, don't be afraid to ask questions of the staff - they are more than willing to help you find something or even order something special for you.   These days it's so easy to order things on the internet and stores like this go away. Stores like Wal Mart and Best Buy don't help the situation either. They can't really keep up price-wise, but they will have stuff you won't be able to find elsewhere. It's a great place to go to find new music you never heard of before and to find stuff you thought didn't exist or was out of print. I think we should all support small indie/punk record stores when we can. I still buy stuff from here occasionally even though I get most of my stuff from the internet.   I'm glad they kept it open when they had to downsize - it could've been easier to just give up. Kudos to them. It's this and Stinkweeds... when they're gone, it's all over.  Their prices aren't bad actually - and they buy used items. They sell CDs and Vinyl and some tapes still. They also have DVDs and videos and other assorted stuff. It's worth a visit if you've never been.

SCAM!  Yes, that's right... I said "SCAM!"  The Spearmint Rhino has always been a place that's come up as one of the top strip clubs in Vegas. Of course I had to go check it out while in Vegas this weekend with my friend.   First off, we knew about the free limo thing, but weren't able to work that one out. We ended up taking a cab and also paying the steep cover to get in. On the surface, this joint made a decent first impression. A bevy of beautiful girls. You couldn't really go too wrong here looks-wise. Girls here are so consistently good looking, you would think you walked on to a strip club movie set.   It didn't take long though before we started to see the cracks in the foundation here... and they run deep.  Before we could even take it all in, I get accosted and molested by this tall blond Eastern European girl who tried dragging me back to VIP. I had to say "no" half a dozen times and yank my arm away from her before she took the hint.   She kept touching my dick through my pants while trying to pull me to the VIP lounge talking about 200 dollars and how I didn't want to sit at a table because it's no fun there. Well, maybe I like sitting in the main room having drinks and talking to people. Maybe I don't want to go have a private dance with a complete stranger.   That shit is awkward. I would like to get to know someone a little bit first. What if I find out your personality is shit and then I'm stuck in the VIP room with some hot asshole and 200 bucks lighter? Plus, I don't really want some stranger touching my dick instead of a handshake... I suppose I'm weird that way.   My friend and I walked around the club a few times looking for a seat. They let too many people in here. Absurdly too many. I was told to go talk to a guy up at the front if I wanted a seat. He put my name on his list and said he would try to find me something and to just keep checking back with him. I wandered around some more and had 3 more girls come up to me and touch my dick and try to drag me off to the back room. It got quite annoying rather quickly. Let me fucking sit down for 5 minutes.   My friend and I decided to just sit at one of the two bars and have a drink while we wait. Another girl comes up to us and guilts me into buying her a drink. I hate that. I don't buy girls drinks at bars. I buy my date drinks. I buy my friends drinks. I don't buy strangers drinks because they are pretty... or in their bra and panties for that matter.   She did turn out to be useful though because she informed me that if I don't give the guy at the door 100 bucks, I won't get a seat ever. She was kind enough to walk around the place with us looking for open seats. We ended up lucking out by asking a guy if we could sit at his table with him. It was a great spot too. Things were turning around for us.   Then my friend asked the girl who ushered us around the club if he could buy our new friend a dance for sharing his table with us, and she said she didn't do $20 dances - she only did VIP. We all immediately lost interest in her and sent her away. That kind of attitude was just a buzzkill.   This became the standard pretty much - it seemed that most girls there refused to give you a $20 dance on the floor, but would only go back to VIP. I don't want to go to VIP - it's creepy. I don't want to get any more intimate than just the standard lapdance. Looking around, we noticed very few dances on the floor going on - just a long-ass line to the VIP area.   I even had one filthy blond scam artist liar tell me she was under contract and couldn't do $20 dances. She kept coming up to me throughout the night trying to drag me off to VIP. I kept saying I didn't want to go and she kept insisting. I felt like I was trying to wander off a used car lot and a sleazy salesman in a bra and panties wasn't letting me leave.   I had a Larry David moment with this girl. She finally guilted me into going back to the room. She insists I give her the money first - her counting it took up the first song. Then she started doing the worst half-assed standard boring soulless yawn-inducing lapdance without going anywhere near my lap. I stopped her after about 30 seconds and told her I felt swindled and cheated. I wanted to leave and get my money back.   Long story short - It became a big embarrassing ordeal for everyone, but the manager ended up giving me 40 bucks back. It was the principle of the thing for me at this point. We promptly left after this.  Spearmint Rhino has attractive girls, and some of them were actually nice. It's possible to have a good time. However, most girls here seem to only do the VIP room and scam you out of your cash. Drinks are overpriced, it's too dark inside, and they pack it so full it's standing room only.   Arizona clubs give better dances for half the price, the girls don't act like they're too good for the job, and they let you get to know them a bit before you decide you want to go to the VIP lounge with them.

I love a good Vegas Buffet... it's a staple that you need during your weekend or weeklong bender. It's the cure for a hangover. It's also a great way to fill yourself up when you're not sure what you even want to eat.   When I go, I always have what I call "The Noah's Ark" - as you can imagine, this is where I put two of every animal in my belly.   Bellagio is one of my favorite Buffets. I like Treasure Island and Mirage buffets as well - wasn't too keen on Aria's. Some of the best buffets can be had outside of the strip, but we're here to talk about Bellagio...  This casino is beautiful - the walk to get the the buffet is pleasant - we usually travel past the garden that they change seasonally. It's touristy, but it sets the mood. I also appreciate that the Bellagio casino doesn't smell as overwhelming of old lady perfume and cigarette smoke as others on the strip.  The line for this is INSANE if you show up during peak hours - here's a tip - after you check out, have your hotel hang on to your bags and get some shopping done or have a nice walk before heading over there. If you go between 10 and 2, you're waiting at least an hour.   Either that or bump your mlife card up to a pearl or higher to cut the line. Gamble, gamble gamble...  Half the time I"ve been here, it's been amazing - 5 star all the way... the other times, it has been merely a 3 star experience. Mirage is more reliable, but not as good when both are at their best.  If you've never had a Vegas buffet, this is a solid pick to be your first. If you're a veteran to it, you should really give this place a try as well.

I can't remember if I've been inside or not... I pretty much just order delivery. The food at this place is soooo fucking good. I think if I actually went there, it might spoil the magic a little bit. I prefer to imagine it as some really clean and yet authentic italian bistro.   Pizza is excellent, hot subs are amazing, pasta dishes are to die for, and salads are perfect. The prices are great too. If they will deliver to you, you might as well call Jerry Springer and schedule a time a few years from now when he can film you being forklifted from your house.  Edit 4/21/08 - I finally visited the location... it's in that gungy strip mall on 40th and Indian School. I had imagined it being a gorgeous italian cafe in the middle of a lush green field with butterflies floating around and a bunch of stereotype chubby italian chefs with large moustaches bustling around tossing pizza dough in the air.   The truth is, it's just a tiny spot in an old strip alongside a crappy gym and a grocery store. They have nice little cafe tables and chairs outside on the sidewalk and a few tables inside, so it would be great for lunch - however, I wouldn't suggest it for a romantic dinner. I'm sticking with delivery or pickup.   Still 5 stars, still love it.  Here's a tip: If you wrap the leftover pizza in foil and fridge it, when you want to eat it again - it's great cold, but if you start up the oven to pre-heat at about 350, you can stick the pizza on the foil in the oven and it'll be ready by the time it's done pre-heating... that should be in just a few minutes. It'll taste like they just delivered it.

I had to move in October and I'm no longer in the delivery range of this place, but I still visit when I can and keep in touch with the owner. This is easily my favorite place in town for pizza. The cheesesteaks are incredible as well.   The ambiance isn't fancy - it's a little hole-in-the wall of an old strip mall... If the staff is short with you, it's because this place is almost always busy. The best pizza places are usually the ones that are always busy. Think about it.   If you ate here and didn't fall in love, you're doing it wrong - try again.

Douchey, small, overpriced, overhyped. If you're out for some sort of exclusive fancy-pants dress-up Scottsdale club full of college age kids, go here. Dirtyscottsdale.com gets a lot of their pictures from here.

I've been here only twice. Today would've brought the experience down to a 1 star, but the previous one being a 3 - I settled on a 2.   This place is huge and dripping with atmosphere. It's sprawling in fact and the patio wraps around a duck and swan pond... can be fun, but can also be annoying. Depends on how you feel about birds. Maybe it's romantic. Maybe it's disgusting. Personally, I find it to be a little bit of both.  The food is average. The salsa is very tasty, but not spicy enough. Today they were having a buffet style thing for the mad rush of mother's day. The place was empty though. There were a lot of wait staff - about one per table... on a buffet night even. With all these servers, we found it nearly impossible to get service.  We opted out of the buffet since it didn't seem cost effective (or appetizing, but we had driven so far we thought we should make the most of it), and sat at the bar forever waiting for one of the 5 servers to stop watching Castaway on TBS long enough to ask us what we wanted.    The margaritas were weak and not very cheap. The waiter was rude, but he brought us a refill during a commercial. I think it's simply too far to be worth it. If the food was above average and the service was good, this would be a fun time. The whole area is a very touristy spot. I'd suggest it as a place to take your parents when they come visit you.

Fantastic food, but generic breakfast restaurant atmosphere. The french toast was amazing - two inch thick slices of bread. If you want a big hearty breakfast, this is a solid choice. Everything was good. My only complaint really was the lack of choices for potato. Eggs were perfect, bacon was tremendous and not too greasy, and english muffin was nice... muffin was a little overbuttered for my taste, but good. Breakfast is simple, but also easy to fuck up. They do a great job with it overall.   The service was good when I went. Seated rather quickly and our server was cute and happy to please. I'm a fussy customer too, so she did really well to cope with me.   A few random notes... Prices were a bit on the high side, but you certainly get a huge amount of food. They carry Splenda, but you have to ask for it because they don't keep it at the tables. Their coffee is average, but certainly acceptable. The sizes of their glasses are pure comedy. I ask for an OJ, and then have to select a size... I'm told sizes are 'regular,' 'large,' and 'huge' - there was a tiny glass already in front of me and that turned out to be the large. I could only imagine the shot-glass they call a regular. The huge glass is what I'd call regular. It was big enough for an OJ though.  I don't know that I'd drive out of my way considering how many awesome breakfast places are near my home, but if I was in that area I'd definitely stop there for a good hearty breakfast.

I like the food here. They have a great menu. Some of the items aren't so great and they also aren't entirely consistant with preparation. They are very very accomidating though, so if they screw up they will do it over for you or take it off the bill. They also have tons of beers on tap. If you like beer - it's a great place to go.   They recently removed a bunch of bench seating in favor of tables and chairs... I wasn't a fan of them doing so, but it's no big deal... it just means it's now more likely to see other people there. Before, it was easier to just eat your meal with your friends in isolation - now it's more open and you have to be subjected to the douchebaggery that huddles around the bar.  It has become a bit of a hangout for the snottsdale crowd it seems. No big deal really - if you like that, you can hang out there and be seen. If you're not into it, at least you can check out a few fake boobs while you down a pint of fancy imported beer.  If you like beer, but hate this atmosphere - head south a bit to Papago Brewery.   Yardhouse gets my approval only because of the food and comfortable booths and great beer selection and accomidating service.

I have avoided this place up until now because everyone I knew who had been said it was terrible. I was somewhat amused by the name of the place, but I'm a believer in word of mouth - and the WOM of this place was dismal.  Tonight my dining companion and I were headed to Sauce and decided to try Pink Taco on a whim. The place wasn't very packed - there were plenty of tables available at 7pm on a Friday, so we were seated right away.   The way the place is set up, we were seated right near the bar and our table was bar height. This meant that we had to endure assholes squeezing past to go to the shitter and people leaving their drinks on our table or leaning on it. It was pretty awful. I understand they have a popular bar, but this is a restaurant too. It would be a really easy fix to solve this problem.  On to the food... it was shit. The dishes are somewhat inspired by mexican cuisine, but they are rather bland and kinda gross. The burrito I had was horrible - dog food. It smelled rank and I couldn't finish it. The salad wasn't bad, but it was boring. My girl got shrimp tacos and ended up feeling ill later in the night. She wasn't at all impressed.  Drinks - I had a house margarita on rocks with salt. It was pretty tasty, but lacked a fair amount of alcohol... plus, it has given me a headache - I'm blaming cheap tequilla. My girl had a signature margarita - I tasted it and it was decent, but a little too sweet. They had a 'wine tasting' of their own label wine as well. They had a chardonnay and a pinot noir/chardonnay mix... we had a taste of the latter and it literally tasted like a mimosa made with rancid orange juice that was sopped up with a dirty dishrag and squeezed into the glass.  Everyone in the joint was either an old ugly dude or a high-school girl wearing big sister's clothes or gay couples. This place is a joke. I wouldn't come for the food, nor the atmosphere, nor the drinks. I'm never going back.  On the upside, dinner was under 100 bucks and the hostess was cute. Apart from that, this place needs to be stayed away from.

As everyone else has stated - this is a wonderful theater. If there's an independent movie out with any sort of buzz attached, they'll play it here. You won't find the latest from Michael Bay on these screens. One of my favorite valley theaters.

IKEA can suck my LEKSVIK.  Every time I go to IKEA, I'm reminded why I hate it so much - and yet I keep returning. Just entering the store is like going on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride - once you enter, you can't leave until you've taken the entire tour through the maze of shitty Swedish furniture. They provide you with cheap shitty food, a place to crap or puke it out, and strategically placed seating so you can rest. They black out the windows so you have no sense of time as well. It's evil genius.   I think it's absurd that people actually eat here - like they just accept that they are being held prisoner by an evil Swedish furniture factory. The cheap food is too cheap - it's gut-rot inducing and it pains me just to think about it. Hot Dogs and Meat Balls? Are you serious? You don't even know what kind of mystery meat it is - much less if it's even real meat... and you happily pay a buck like you're really sticking it to the man with your bargain meal. Gag me.  Just like at Disneyland, people bring their fucking ugly kids here and allow them to run around free screaming like wild animals. Parents use their strollers as battering rams to make way through the crowd. Nobody in there has ever showered in their life. I sometimes suspect that everyone there is a paid extra - nobody is ever buying anything.  There are two ways to shop here: 1. Arrive having researched and read the catalog and have a specific list of things to buy. 2. Wander around aimlessly for 3 hours, pick up something that you kinda need and carry it around with you for another 3 hours, give up the moment you have the exit door in sight and leave your single pathetic item on a pallet of flat-pack deck chairs and bypass the checkout lines so you can taste freedom at last.  IKEA furniture is cheap, but expensive. It looks nice from far away, but up close you can see that it's junk. Run your hand along any of their wood counter surfaces and you'll feel the warping. Have a look at any corner on any dresser and you'll see the finish peeling away. It's good for utility furniture or to fill out a guest bedroom or storage room or kids room, but unless you're a college kid - this furniture is garbage. To top it off, it's overpriced.   The only things worth buying here are lightbulbs and batteries (which honestly aren't that great) because they are cheap. Even their flatware is crap - it rusts... yes, it rusts. You're better off going to Tuesday Morning or Ross or even Target and picking up something nicer. Don't be fooled by the contemporary modern urban stylings - IKEA is overpriced crappy junk. It's not cheap because they flat pack and pass the savings on to you - it's cheap because it's junk.   I have some IKEA dressers and I use them as DVD storage - they work fine, but I don't expect them to last forever. Their couches are all uncomfortable, their chairs are even worse. The beds are barely one step up from sleeping on the floor. Their kitchen and bathroom cabinets are awful - you'll be sorry if you remodel your rooms with this stuff.   I like the look of IKEA - honestly, I do. I think it's a good concept and they have some really good style ideas. Nothing they sell is really well-made and assembly is required... considering what it is, it's overpriced. That said - you can find some decent stuff here. Inexpensive poorly-crafted furniture has its applications.

While it's not my favorite place, I think this is a good venue. It's the spot of my very first big concert (New Order 1989). Since then, I've seen some fantastic shows here - Beastie Boys, Circle Jerks, Violent Femmes, REM, etc... I've even been back stage here hanging out with some of the bands.   I have good memories here, so I have no reason to fault it. The parking, the ants, the vendors, the security... I don't remember any of that. I just remember good times... I just remember the music. That's the way it should be. I do remember that they have good sound and the grounds are typically kept fairly nice.   The last time I was there was 5 to 8 years ago, so perhaps things have changed. I imagine it's pretty much the same.

Food is fantastic... salads are amazing... pizza is tasty. Selection of wine is decent enough and not terribly overpriced. The seating is very cafeteria like - similar to Pei wei or Chipotle - you place your order and take your number and drinks to your seat... someone brings you your food and they clear your table of empty plates.   The food has been very reliable and I love to eat here.   I'm not a fan of the seating and atmosphere though - the menu should drop a buck or two here and there to reflect the ambiance.   The place usually has a good amount of people in it and depending on the time of day, someone's brought their noisy kids in there. It's not as bad as peter piper pizza, but I think the rich parents shopping at fashion square or waterfront consider it as such when their kids start crying for pizza. It's also a hot spot apparently for teenage high school girls... much like Ra Sushi.   If the food wasn't as good as it is, I'd never go there again.

Good burgers - not terribly special. We ate a Kobe Beef burger and I guess it was pretty tasty. People will compare this place to Delux and to be honest, I don't really think that place is all that special either. You can get a better burger at Z Tejas or even Big Fat Greek.   We also had a chicken Caesar salad and I thought it was decent... again, nothing terribly special. They have funky silverware and glasses - which is neat. I also kinda liked the diner atmosphere.   I thought the service was fine... VERY attentive on drink refills, but they weren't that busy. I think for the prices, they could offer cloth napkins. Speaking of which, the prices here are a little steep for a burger, but not too far off what you would expect when you're already thinking of Delux. I'd say to compare the two is like comparing apples to apples and not being able to tell much of a difference. Gun to my head, I'm choosing Delux, but only because you get more fries and it's closer to where I live. My actual first choice would be Z Tejas though.

I'm writing this on my laptop as I sit on the toilet - it has been less than 1 hour since I ate there. This is round 2 of what I predict will be at least a 3 round battle between my stomach and Moe's *courtesy flush*. My girlfriend is currently having her own private battle in the other bathroom.  I had a steak burrito and she had a chicken burrito. I didn't eat beans or rice and she did. The only things we had the same were the tortilla, the chips, the cheese, and the diet soda... why we are both ill off this, I don't really know. I started to feel the 'gut rot' as I took my last bite.   The steak tasted somewhat odd - I figured it was the sauce it was soaking in... the meat was very drippy and soggy. The chips were stale and bland and looked like they came out of a bag. I'm told the chicken was pretty mediocre.   The fake-nice we encountered when we walked in was kinda irritating to me, but I'm sure it's fun if you're in that kind of mood. I guess I wasn't. The atmosphere was less than special as well. It reminded me of Peter Piper Pizza.  I think the problem is that I went to Chipotle before ever going to Moe's. I was spoiled. Fresh ingredients, much of it organic, and a classy atmosphere. Moe's is just barely a half-step above Taco Bell, but with Chipotle prices.   I understand that this place is really busy during lunch, and I went in the evening - perhaps when it's busier, the food is better?  I'm never going back - apart from the food giving me assplosions, it tasted pretty awful (especially compared to Chipotle). Anyway - this place sucks... boo-hiss.

Hey, let's build a mall that will blend in with the surrounding landscape... no, not the desert landscape, but the urban sprawl of North Phoenix.  This mall is huge... a huge parking lot. You have to drive from store to store because it makes little sense to walk from one end to the other. And it doesn't help that the parking lot is like a giant black tar canvas to absorb all of the heat from the sun and radiate it through the area. It's got to be like 5-10 degrees hotter at this mall.  Desert Ridge wants you to come and stay all day and night. Screw that, I have shit to do. I try to avoid this place, but on occasion I find myself here. It gives me an Outlet Mall vibe - like Anthem - but that might just be because it's totally out of my way to go here... like Anthem.  Desert Ridge is not bad - if you're looking for it, it's here (if you can find it). I just don't like it. Maybe it was built on a cursed ancient Indian burial ground... or a landfill.

Meatballz is tucked away inside a typical North Scottsdale strip mall. I wouldn't really call this a restaurant - it's set up more like a lunch deli. You wait in line to place an order, you pour your own drink into styrofoam cups using the self-serve fountain, you find whatever seat you can, and wait for your food.   Now, the way this place works is like many places who are adopting this trend where you place your order and take a number to your table and someone brings your food to you when it's ready. It means you don't have waiters really, but you also don't have to stand around waiting to pick up your order... If you want to tip, they have a tip jar.  The seating is very cheap and ugly, but it's comfortable and you're not really here for the ambience. You come here for good food at a decent price with no signifigant hassle. It's your lunch spot if you work in the area. There's really no reason to make a special trip here, but if you're checking out car dealerships or doing some shopping or on a lunch break - it's a solid choice.  They do catering - even on short notice. A lot of businesses in the area do take-out here. They have pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, and the standard fare. We ordered a pizza, a sandwich and a pasta dish. They have great meatballs and stuffed pasta. The pizza looked delicious, but we're saving it for dinner. Their sandwich bread is a little "artisan" for my taste (artisan translates to dry and stale as far as I'm concerned), but they use quality meats and cheeses.   The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and the food is solid and reliable. You can't really go wrong. I still prefer DeFalco's by a mile, but if I ever end up in this area, I might go again.

3.5 stars, but closer to 4 than 3. This place is great for a good sandwich at nearly any hour. Their cheese steaks are authentic and tasty. They are a bit of a gut bomb though... The meat they use isn't top quality, but it's not McDonald's either. When it's late and you've been drinking though - it hits the spot like no other. I also crave these things inexplicably.  When it is late on a club night, they have a DJ spinning hip-hop. You will be surrounded by stumbling hungry chubbers looking not as fresh as they did when they went out earlier that night under the harsh fluorescent lighting. The music and the crowd can be a little much at times. The kids that work there are good looking and nice.   There's some cheap seating outside, but that's a last resort - this place delivers at crazy hours and they are also easy to do take out from.

I've known Kimber for nearly 20 years now - I've been shopping at Stinkweeds forever... started at the Mesa location and then followed it to Tempe. I've been introduced to all sorts of music here. This store will always be a part of my growing up. I had a live show at the Tempe location once (sang for Seven Storey Mountain)... I was nervous as hell and even forgot some of the words. It was like performing for family.  It has been ages since I've been to the Phoenix location, but I still feel like it's a distant relative of mine... like a really cool eccentric young aunt that had me stay over at her place for a weekend and taught me about life and gave me beer when I was still too young. Knowing the people who own it and work there, I'm sure it's just as clean and cool and awesome as the other locations have been.   Thank god for all the independent record stores of the world. Thank god for Stinkweeds. This is the sort of place that gets young people interested in music. This is the sort of place that inspires and creates new musicians. Without independent music stores like this supporting independent musicians and independent publications and independent shows and independent thought, music would simply be a corporate product meant to fill space between commercials.   If your interest in music is more of a passing fancy than a passion, then this place may not be for you. If you like shit that isn't typically on the radio, then you'll love this place.   On a side note - Dave B's review was amusing, but linking to a site suggesting people steal music instead of buy it is bad form. Independent music exists in part because of stores like this. I'm my parents and it's better to shop at Best Buy or iTunes or to steal music than to shop at a cozy little friendly non-chain record store?

I thought this place had sandwiches made out of Bison meat - but no... "Bison Witches... Buy Sandwiches." Get it?  I know I'm on a roll with the 5 star reviews here, but this place deserves it as well. So incredibly good. It's a great little bar tucked behind the bank and the food is amazing. I loved my sandwich. I'm definitely going back.   While I was sitting there eating my sandwich, a bus rolled up and a girl's college volleyball team piled off to come in and eat - they were all wearing their uniforms and some had ice packs taped to their knees or elbows etc... I won't say that this swayed my review score, but it didn't hurt. This is a lovely place. Eat here.

Usually at least somewhat busy - this bar has a few things going for it... For one, it's got a great location - although it's a little close to competitor Salty Senorita. Second, it's got chips and salsa and standard mexi food and the kitchen is "open late" (whatever that means). The food isn't so bad - it gets the job done... but I don't know that I'd suggest it for a sit-down meal. Maybe it's good if you're planning on making it a long night and you want to get some food to keep you going. I don't know...   The layout of Loco is fairly comfortable and casual - although when it's crowded, it gets difficult to navigate around the small bar to get a drink. When you do get a drink, they aren't weak or terribly expensive. The problem with this bar is that it's a douche-fest. Looking around the room on any given weekend night, you can just go "douche, douche, douche, plastic, douche, plastic, douche..." and you'll know there's probably $8000 worth of fancy jeans in room. It's a slightly different crowd from Salty's I think. There are a lot of good looking people there usually, but it's just not my crowd. Maybe I'm getting too old.

Neat bathrooms, but fuck those cunts for turning me away because I had converse on. Shine flashlights on my shoes? Eat a bag of dicks. I even had a VIP pass and converse were a no-go. I don't think it's that I'm getting old either because I've always hated dress code clubs in Scottsdale - dating back to Cat Eye Lounge when it was on 5th and Scottsdale rd. I'm talking over a decade of this nonsense.   We're not in LA, assholes. You can make people wait in line outside your empty club and enforce a dress code, but it won't make your place any cooler. I think if you are wearing an expensive shirt and shiny shoes and $200 jeans, you could go check it out and maybe try to get a young drunk girl to let you buy her drinks so she can reject your proposal to go bang in your Camry.   Normally when I'm going to one of these places, I have a pair of shitty Payless shoes that cost me 8 bucks that usually gain me admission. I suppose I'd rather have some dumbfuck door guy judging me by my shoes than some vapid plastic idiot judging me by my car keys.   So I actually have been inside E4 a few times... like I said, nice bathrooms. It's like Myst, but different layout. Neat decoration - really dark (so who the fuck is going to see my shoes anyway??) - different rooms and themes and lots of nooks and crannys to park your ass in. There's an inconveniently located dance area and traffic flow is horribly planned out. When it's busy, it sucks.   Oh, this section is reserved? Oh I see. Well, then fuck me - I'll just suck the alcohol off my 8 dollar glass of ice cubes and stare at girls gone wild playing dress-up.  They have a menu for food and their food is neat sounding, but all of it is bland and flavorless - much like the way this club has no soul. If you're a young hipster and want to have a dress-up night, it's a decent choice - but even then it's not high on my list. If you have a party and reserve a room it can be fun... sort of. Really though, this place rubs me the wrong way in general.

I'm surprised this has no reviews yet... perhaps there's another entry for it. Anyway, I think this chain has fairly consistent food and even more consistent service... both range from decent to excellent. I have to admit that the Tempe Mill Avenue location is better, but this place is good as well. The portions are large, so show up hungry. If you are having soda or water with your meal, expect a gigantic 64 oz glass to drink from. It's ridiculous, but I'll admit that I've had a refill here.   Prices are fairly reasonable for a mid-upper scale chain restaurant. The food is tasty and typically good. The service is usually really good as well. I can't see a reason to give it a bad review. It's definitely not Mediterranean food for foodies.. it's more for casual diners or the uninitiated. They have good hummus and pitas, but it's basically just another American restaurant with a slight Mediterranean accent. Very accessible.  This place barely earns a 4.  Edit: ok, I found the entry for this place on yelp by looking at a map of the area and local places... I just did a search and found the other entry for this place (don't know why yelp does this). So there were other reviews for this restaurant already.

A sign of a good breakfast joint is a long wait to sit down. This place is pretty standard and basic - giant lofty room with wooden benches, glass plates, cheap flatware, chipped coffee mugs and your own coffee themos carafe to pour your own coffee. This place is standard and generic in every way - and that's a good thing. They take a formula that works everywhere and they run with it.   The food is fantastic - some of the fluffiest scrambled eggs I've ever eaten actually... tasty bacon... yummy protein pancakes.   The staff is great too - chipper and polite and cute. This place is a well-oiled machine doing one thing very well. The prices are pretty reasonable and even though we were 7th down on the list to wait - we were told it would only be 10 minutes and it was. Efficient, tasty, and reliable.  As a side note - perhaps one of the best parts about this place is that it's not the Breakfast Club and you don't have to look like you just went to the club... non-pretentious breakfast. Yum.

Nothing special or clean about the decor. Flat soda made the drinks taste like shit. Strong drinks, but questionable whether or not that was actually Bacardi in that bottle. Some dude was interrupting his very public makeout session with his girlfriend (or hook-up) every so often just so he could spit his chew saliva on the floor in front of us. Some other dude was notable for having the most impressive sweaty pit stains on record. I think we were there during the annual sausage festival... though one of the few girls that was there looked like a dude cross dressing as Tina Yothers from Family Ties. Another girl was an aggressive looking butchy lass who spent the whole night killing zombies or whatever on this shotgun video game. Aside from that game, seemed like there wasn't much else to do besides sit and drink.  On the plus side, the service behind the bar was quite good... they were on top of their shit. The drinks weren't very cheap, but they were strong (as I said). They have a tiny patio and there are plenty of places to sit.  I hated it, but it's probably a decent place to get drunk. Given the location, it's more prone to the kind of people I'd rather avoid than other dive bars in So Sco.   I've been exactly once though, so it's probably a different experience on any other given night. I probably won't be back though.

In desperate need of renovation, but this place still manages to function. The bathrooms are gross and concessions are a joke. Bring your own stash of junk food from a convenience store and you're good. You can sit outside of your car in lawn chairs, you can sit inside your car facing forwards, you can face backwards and sit in the back of your hatchback or SUV and lay down. It's a different experience than going to a regular theater.   It sucks in the summer - obviously. The lots are pretty dusty, so expect your car to get a little dusty. You can sneak people in under a blanket in the back seat and not have to pay if you're a cheapass... They give you radio stations to tune to instead of a little box to hang on your window like they used to back in the day.  If something doesn't work, they give you a refund. If your battery dies, they give you a jump. You can see a double feature - an older movie (from a month or so ago) and a newer one (brand new release within the last few weeks). They sometimes have two showings, so you can go see two, then drive to a different lot and see two more - if you plan it right. I've done that before... it's a lot of movies, but sometimes you just haven't had enough time to roll around in the back of your station wagon making out with that chick...   It's fun and something everyone should do at least once.  Make a group thing of it and bring some weed or beer or other booze and drugs. Bring a hooker - everything goes. Keep in mind, sometimes people bring kids and people will smoke in their cars near you. People also will bring dogs and let them roam around sometimes.

This place looks like it was designed by a High School Prom committee. There are a few cool aspects - like the stripper pole/dance tables for patrons... The paid dancers look a little busted, but from far away and 3 drinks deep you won't notice. From what I could tell, the drinks were fairly stiff.   The music was a strange medly of 15 or so different songs - all very standard and mainstream from 10 years ago. We were there long enough to hear most of the songs repeat. Most people didn't seem to mind though.   Cherry has a dress code - no baggy clothes, no head gear, no athletic wear, and no excessive jewelry. They don't stick to it though. They also don't seem to worry too much about losing their liquor license as we saw someone slip the door guy a 20 to let his fake ID pass. College students take note. Once inside though, the place was full of ugly fat drunk heffers dancing on the pole like they're trying out for the Pussycat Dolls and dudes in baggy mid-90s era clothing and baseball hats.   It reminded me of being in my early 20s and going to shitty Tempe clubs, listening to shit music all night, and then wondering why I was going home alone... Now I know why - it's because everyone was plug-ugly and I simply couldn't find anyone worth chatting up.   We had a 'VIP' booth (it was a friend's hook-up), so don't think I paid to get in or even paid for my drinks... I did pay the price of my valuable time though. This place is shit - plain and simple. It does have a few cool elements inside though and the location isn't bad if you like being in downtown Tempe. Saturdays may be better than Fridays... You'll have to let me know as I will not be returning.

I remember as kid my older sister would drive me to one of the only gelato places in town in old town Scottsdale. I don't think this was it, but I know it's near the same area. Old Town has changed so much over the years. I remember when they tore down the Kachina theater (where I saw E.T.) to put up the forever abandoned Galleria. I remember when they tore down my favorite hot dog joint and put up a Gilbert Ortega behind the cowboy sign.  Anyway - even though this probably isn't the same gelato place I vaguely remember as a kid and it's totally modern inside, it still makes me feel nostalgic. It's a great place to stop by if you're walking around downtown and want a cold treat. It's an even better place to get dinner. This location serves wood-fired pizza, salads, and sandwiches as well.  I have been here a bunch of times, but recently had some lunch. I ordered a Pepperoni and Sausage pizza. It was insane. It comes on a hand-tossed thin crust which is flavorful and just the right amount of crispy. The pepperonis were spicy and some of the best I've ever had. I was truly impressed. Price-wise, it was a lot of food for the money and you could tell it was high quality ingredients. The portions are perfect for leaving room for a bit of gelato, feeling full but not bloated and about to die, and also friendly on the wallet.  I also had some of my girlfriend's salad and was impressed with that as well. We finished it off with some gelato of course - 2 flavors each so we got to try 4 (plus the free tastes). I try not to eat ice cream or gelato very often, but this is definitely worth the calories.   Service is great - everyone that works there is nice and friendly. The place is always clean and apparently they are soon going to be opening the upstairs as a dining area. The decor is modern and feels very upscale. This would be a fantastic place to take a first date if you're in high school or college and on a budget. You'll get out of here for less than you would at a chain like Outback or something.

I love this little sushi spot - it's off the beaten path, so people don't often think of it when they think of Sushi. It's great though - good food, good service, nice atmosphere. I wouldn't say the sushi blows away the competition or anything, but it's certainly quality as well as being inexpensive.  This place lives in a little unassuming strip mall, so it lacks the posh curb appeal first impression. It definitely makes up for it though by being a solid and reliable restaurant where you can get some tasty dishes. I tend to forget it's even there, so I'm always happy to remember it when my friend suggests it. Incidentally, he has a bit of a crush on a cute girl that works (or used to work) there, so he has 'dibs' on her (with his wife's permission).

I love this place - forgot to review it. Excellent, reliable Thai food.   We enjoyed every dish, and felt good about it afterward. This place is nice inside and clean. The owner is very sweet, and the staff is nice. They deliver. I really can't think of a downside to this place (other than I spend too much money here).   Portions are generous, so two people could share an entree as long as you got a good amount of sides. The dishes are a good amount of food for one person though on their own. We ordered sides and two entrees and there were some leftovers. It all came with a huge helping of white rice - I sort of prefer a stickier rice, but that's gonna be up to individual preference. It was cooked well and was tasty.   We don't live too far from here, so we'll be back.

I have to shamefully admit that I like this indoor shopping facility. True, it is overcrowded on the weekends. Also true, it is poorly designed so that it's disorienting to navigate. True again, it is full of kids. And even though it's just a mall, it's a great example of one.  On the surface it doesn't seem so special, but when you investigate further, you'll notice that the stores here seem to carry more "stuff" than the same stores at other malls around the valley. They'll still carry stuff that would normally head to outlet stores for awhile, and they carry the obscure online-only items you won't find elsewhere.   Perhaps this isn't the case for every store, but if you're a mall shopper - you should check this place out to see what I'm talking about. Compare Nordstroms and Buckle and even A&F here to the one at your local mall. I know none of these stores are compelling enough reasons to go out of your way, but I don't like to have to go to these stores very often so when I do go I want to make the most of it.  The theater attached here is pretty nice and there are one or two fairly unique stores, but otherwise this is a very standard example of a mall - a good example, but also nothing too special. I wouldn't suggest braving it on a weekend, but during the week should prove to be a fruitful shopping day.  3.5/5

They did a fantastic job renovating this place. It's a great place for a special occasion. My friend had his wedding here... it's a perfect spot. The bar area is neat, but way overpriced. It's a little hoity toity for me as well... if you've got that kind of money, you would probably like it.  The pool area is nice, but frequently crowded with what appears to be Mtv Spring Breakers or models. Actually - crowds depend on time of day/week/month/year... The rooms are quite nice and once they finish construction next door, the views will be good again. I don't like to valet my car, so I'm not a fan of the parking situation. The Ho makes a great backdrop for photo shoots as well.   I think if you have wealthy family or friends in town, this is one of the better options available. It's also good to meet some friends at the bar if you've got the dough and want to play dress-up. I'm glad they decided to keep it around... I'm kinda upset though that they changed the Valley Ho sign on the corner of 68th and Indian School... after all that work to renovate the place, they finally lose that sign that has been there since I can remember. Pity.

I've been coming to this theater for years and have been a few times since they remodeled and changed concept. Most recently was a few weekends ago to see Gravity...   The seats are comfortable enough, and I don't really mind the concept of dine and watch a movie - but then again, maybe I do. I've been to a few other theaters with this format, and I guess I find it kind of distracting and annoying with waiters wandering around. I mean, it has its pluses and minuses.   The food here is okay. In no way is it worth the price you pay, but it's also pretty absurd that regular cheap ass candy is just as expensive here as anywhere else (as others have pointed out), and when proposed next to their "fancy" desserts, the price of a box of Dots is ridiculous.   So I get that people make mistakes and everyone has a bad day and all that, but while sitting and trying to watch the movie, the waiter carrying a bag of popcorn to someone behind me dumps the entire thing on my lap, and in my drink and all over my pizza. I don't mind so much... I'm just trying to watch Sandra Bullock float in space. However, he apologizes profusely and asks me what I was eating and drinking... I said "pizza and a coke zero." He takes my food and drink away and says he'll bring me replacements. He leaves me covered in popcorn shrapnel.  Half an hour later, I get a replacement pizza... still no drink. I ask him again for a Diet Coke or Zero... about 15 minutes later, someone else hands me a Coke. Nope. Then another guy comes by and sweeps around me. All of this is REALLY fucking distracting while trying to watch a film. I ask someone else for a Coke Zero or Diet Coke... eventually, I get it.   Then later, the guy bugs me again to give me a bag of popcorn "on the house" - uhh... thanks, but if I wanted popcorn, I would've ordered some in the first place. I get it though - nice gesture. I didn't eat any of it.  Then the bill comes and the movie is over. The bill has 2 pizzas on it. I'm like, "WTF!?" I didn't even ask for a replacement pizza! We sit around waiting for someone to come by and nothing... I get up and go to find my waiter guy and he's disappeared. A girl who may have been a manager asks me what's up and I unload on her all of the anger and rage I had apparently stored up combined with all the tension and intensity created by the film I had just watched.   She took my bill and said she would remove a pizza... then came back and said to just go ahead and leave without paying because their credit card machines were down. I gave her whatever cash I had on me and split... on the ride home, I decided that was dumb because she probably just pocketed it. Then I figured she probably earned it for listening to me say fuck a bunch of times loudly. Then I went back to wishing I had just left.   They should've offered me my ticket(s) back and comped my drink and removed the extra pizza and apologized... or maybe offered passes to another show. They could've handled it way better than they did. I mean, spilling popcorn on me isn't even a big deal at all - they just kept making it worse and worse. As it stands, I probably won't be back.  And Gravity was fucking top! It was so amazing, though I probably need to see it again without a bunch of bullshit going on around me.

Ok - first off, I have to admit that this place had good - nay - delicious food. From pizza to pasta, Boston's did it well. That's where the good times end.  A few years ago, this place had everything going for it... great food, nice atmosphere, cool staff and they provided a place for me and my friends to play poker tournaments. Then, for some reason the cuntbag that ran the place decided to screw over the company that was hosting the tournament and do poker on their own. The dipshits didn't realize that the 60 - 100 of us that showed up weekly only came because of the company that ran the poker tournaments. And the backlash caused most of us to stop coming there altogether (as many of us went there regularly even on a non poker night).  It had been awhile then since I had been here since I was boycotting it. But, some friends and I were starving and everywhere else was packed, so we thought it might still be good. And it kinda was... the food was still tasty.   First thing I noticed when I walked in was that they changed the interior - getting rid of some sports memorabilia and some walls. It looked more generic. The place was also kinda deserted for a Friday or Saturday night (can't remember which). It seemed like there were as many servers as patrons.   You would think with those odds, we would get amazing service - nope. Our waiter was dirt. He was sweatty and impatient, but he brought us our drinks, took our order and let someone else bring out our food while he spent 40 minutes or so chit chatting about World of Warcraft with his dipshit friend 15 feet away from our table. Meanwhile, we were thirsty as fuck and standing next to our booth staring at him - he occasionally would look over at us, but continue to dismiss us. Nobody else ever came by either.   I ended up having to go up and ask for more drinks and was met with scournful and confused looks as though I had done something wrong. WELL FUCK ME, ASSHOLES - I'M SORRY FOR BEING THIRSTY! DIE!!!  The guy eventually concluded is conversation about leveling up and he came over to hand us our check. Our table was never pre-bussed either (meaning we had to stare at our dirty plates the entire time we were there waiting for drinks and the check).   Anyway, I hate this place now - but their food is good (though perhaps a bit generic)... honestly, you can do better food-wise (which is good since this place is ass).  Go fuck yourself, Boston's.

Man, my last review was pretty unfair. I was actually a fan of this place for a long time - I was just really bitter about not having that poker tournament to go to anymore. I loved it so.   In my previous review, I threw around harsh names and whatnot at the owners - that was uncalled for and immature. Their food is good as I remember. I haven't actually been back in years - not since I wrote that last review. They didn't deserve that, and I'm only leaving it up to show what a jerk I was for writing it. Granted, I did have an awful experience that one night, but that wasn't the norm and every place has a bad night. Over the years, I've become much more understanding and tolerant of bad experiences like this.   Sorry, Boston's. I take it all back.

They have a good selection of wines and the staff can be helpful if they aren't preoccupied or busy. Their prices are somewhat decent and I believe they DO have a case discount... but don't quote me on that. I think I had to ask for it. I can't remember.   They have a lot of accessories and junk for sale as most wine stores do. They also have wine tasting events. It's best for just shopping for a few bottles. Their recommendations to me have had about 70% success rate.

I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since before they started expanding locations. This one is much closer to me than the original. The one in Tempe has always had weird spacey hot chicks working there... I always sort of wondered if it was a cult of some sort. It has since become I guess the ideal dream job for a hot college/high-school hipster. Every location I've been to is the same in this respect.   It's also the same experience in terms of great food. The menus vary slightly from location to location, but the comestibles are always outstanding. If you like hummus, you should like this. It's light and creamy and flavorful. Not gritty or bland at all. I'd say in the last few years they've even improved on their food in terms of quality if that was possible. Their chicken has been more reliable and everything is just more consistent. Everything else... veggies, salads, pasta, pitas, etc... all great. Most of it healthy as well as tasty.   I love that you can see the kitchen while you wait for your food. It's so clean. After watching Kitchen Nightmares for the past few years, I'm paranoid about dirty kitchens. This one is immaculate - cleaner than my own. I also dig the decor. Every location is aesthetically pleasant.   Another great thing about this place is that it's not terribly expensive. Three of us ate for 42 bucks. Not too bad. I like this location more for lunch and the Tempe location for dinner. Don't know why, but I'd rather drink wine at the Tempe location.   I can't really complain too much - had less than perfect service once or twice across all locations... had imperfect food a few times. I'm not a fan of the outdoor seating - metal table/chairs - it's not a big deal though. So tough trying to find fault here.   Not only is Pita Jungle one of the best restaurants in the Valley, it's an AZ original (afaik) that we can be proud of. I wish I thought of it more often - particularly when I have out of town guests.   Pita Jungle is full of win.

This is one of the larger locations for Zia in the valley... Walking into this store reminded me of walking into one of the old large Tower Records or Warehouse stores back during their reign. It's large, bright, clean, and organized well.   This location has a great selection of new and used items. They have plenty of Criterion DVDs and a pretty good foreign section. If you live near here, you're lucky... if not, take the trip... it's worth it.   One of the managers - Eric (covered in tattoos and sings in a rock band) - is one of this stores greatest assets. I brought in nearly 100 asian DVDs for trade and he was knowledgeable enough to know what they were and he took them all when the Tempe location was confused and wouldn't even take a look. I'm told that some of his regular customers followed him to this location when he moved from the Tempe store.  I used to shop at Zia when I was a kid, but stopped after awhile because I frequently felt cheated - their prices a bit high and their buyback offers a bit low. Well, the policies here are shared by all the stores, but walking into this store I feel like they've grown up a bit. I'm still mainly an internet shopper, but this location kinda won me over. I'm a fan of Zia again.

Bless me Yelp for I have dined. It's been many months since my last review. It's actually been awhile since I've had much opportunity to check out new (to me) places. It has been a rough year.   Things are turning around though, and I'm D'lighted to get my review'n skills back in shape.   I'm surprised I hadn't eaten here before. I guess I didn't even really know it existed to be honest. I live within a few blocks of here and I love breakfast and I drive by here frequently. Perhaps it is because I'm not a member of the vegetarian/vegan community... though I've dated several vegetarians and vegans so I'm pretty up to date on the places to go for that.   I haven't had my food at this place yet - I've only eaten from the drive through. It seems like a cute little place though. One of these days.   The food is tasty. It's about as tasty as it can be for something that can be considered a healthy breakfast. I tend to prefer a good thick greasy unhealthy artery clogging pile of bacon and some sort of fruit covered waffle or french toast drowned in maple syrup - that doesn't seem to be what this place is about. Still... it's true to its name. It is definitely delicious.   Their prices aren't too bad for what you are getting. It's quality food. I mean, I was getting burned out on shitty fast food breakfast places. I can't stomach the Breakfast Club douchetastic crowd most of the time, and I haven't been really up for eating around any sort of crowd on my weekend mornings. I'd rather eat in the comfort of my own home these days.   I'll have to update this when I have more to say about it - so far, I've only really sampled the food. I have yet to really experience the atmosphere and the service. Sooner or later though...  I'd say this is yet another reason why I still stand behind my belief that Scottsdale is an awesome place to live.

I've been here a few times for diagnosis and estimates for my aging Honda CR-V. I haven't had to have any repairs done here yet, but when the time comes, you can bet your sweet ass I'll be coming here.   So the first time I came here was a year and a half ago when my air conditioner exploded during the Summer. They gave me a much lower estimate than what Showcase Honda gave me, but I was able to get Honda to cover more than half the cost of it since it was a common issue and my car had reasonably low miles, but the catch was that I had to have it done at Showcase Honda (or an authorized dealership).   The next issue happened the other day when my car wouldn't rev past 2500rpm and the engine light came on as I entered the freeway during rush hour. I took it to Showcase Honda again because they were close to where I was. I was way overdue for an oil change, so I asked them to give me an oil change and check the computer to let me know what the error code is for my check engine. It was late, so they would tackle this the next day...   I started doing research while I was waiting to be picked up, and it turned out to be an easy repair if it was what I thought it might be... I went back inside and told the service guy not to fix it - just give me the code. I was planning to either fix it myself or take it to Hon-Man regardless of what they said it would cost. Got a call the next morning from Showcase giving me the error code and telling me it would cost nearly 400 bucks to repair. I told him I would pick it up that afternoon or the next morning.  I did some more research on the code they gave me and the internet said it was common to trip this particular sensor if you were low on oil or had dirty oil. I called back and told this to Showcase and he said that it's super rare and that he's only seen it happen in extreme cases when the oil is super dirty. I asked if they tried revving it again or if they drove it after doing an oil change and asked if my oil had been low or dirty. He said my oil was fine and that they revved it and it was still having the issue.   If I was a stupid dummy, I would have just said "go ahead and fix it." This is how Showcase makes their money. Unnecessary repairs. I'm seething about that place, but I won't talk about it here... I already gave them an earful (and I think there are still some people there with some scruples, but many without).   Anyway, I go to pick up the car, and it's fine. They left the check engine light on for me (because they wanted to extort another 60 bucks out of me), but the car runs fine. I drove it over to Hon-Man, and they looked at it immediately and turned off the check engine light and listened to the engine and such. They gave me sound advice, set up a paper trail on me this time, and didn't charge me a dime. (my favorite part was when he was taking notes in his computer on my recent car issue, he wrote "car was running like shit." and then put down the proper codes and whatnot. I laughed.)   It's entirely possible the problem could come back - if it does, I'll be coming here to get it fixed. The night before, they had quoted me over the phone the cost to fix it and they came in under 200 bucks - half the price of Showcase for the same exact job. Not only that, but the guys here are all cool and nice and fucking honest.   That's the most important thing - they are honest. This place is hard to find - there's not really a sign out on the street that I could see - you just have to know where it is. In spite of this, it seems to always be pretty busy and they are more or less by appointment only, but they don't have to do unnecessary repairs to get that way.   When your car breaks or something goes wrong or it starts running like shit, it's never a good time. You start to stress about money or how you're going to get from appointment A to obligation B. Then you start to stress over where to take your car - who can fix it - who isn't going to rip you off... It can be intimidating going to a repair shop and being at the mercy of someone with more technical expertise than you. That's not the case at Hon-Man. These guys are definitely experts, but not intimidating at all. They are simply awesome and trustworthy. I'm never taking my car anywhere else.

The great thing about this place is that they deliver. The sit-down experience isn't so bad though - it's actually quite pleasant, and the staff is very nice. The back room has a bar and a stage where they could potentially host some badass karaoke or bands or something. Apparently, the building used to be used for such a thing. They did renovate before moving in I think.  They have fairly delicious food - soups are good and their won tons are great. It's pretty standard Asian cuisine... I've had better, but it's reliable and I like it. The prices are reasonable as well. I've had better for sure, but this is good stuff. It would get a 3.5 stars if we could do half stars, but I pushed it to a 4 because it's so convenient and they are nice people - plus, the restaurant itself is kinda neat inside... it has potential anyway.

Located in a small strip mall anchored by a grocery store and a blockbuster, and sandwiched between a water&ice and a beauty supply store and a dry cleaner... this little restaurant is a fresh surprise. If someone blindfolded you and took you here, you wouldn't know you were in a strip mall. The decor is slightly hodge-podge, but a lot nicer than you would expect.  I've been here about half a dozen times and have yet to be disappointed. While it's not my favorite Pho, this place is quite good. They are very accommodating and will pretty much make the dishes however you like. The service is really good - but if it's busy, you may have to exercise a little patience.  I love the egg rolls and the spring rolls were tasty as well. Other Pho places I've been call the fried ones Spring rolls and the non-fried ones Summer rolls, but this place calls the non-fried ones spring rolls. Whatever, just get their sampler platter and enjoy...  There's not much to complain about - it's close, it's clean, good service, and the food is good. I can't explain why I have only been there a handful of times since I've lived about two blocks away from this location since forever. This place doesn't quite make the 5 star mark because I've had slightly better Vietnamese food and because it's located in a spot that should be a Mailboxes Etc. This place deserves a spot among finer dining in downtown Scottsdale... instead it's next to a Subway.  Don't let that stop you - this place is great.

Edible... that's how I'll describe this food. I ate it - cleaned my plate even. I had a lunch special which was a half-salad and a slice. The slice was a "runt" as the waiter described it and swore most slices were larger - he then brought out a second "runt" for half price to make up for the small portion of food.   It's a very generic place considering how much my girlfriend and friend raved about it. These are usually located in small corner strip malls and the decor is entirely forgettable. I had a good look at their bathroom and i thought it was nice and clean and they provided little shot cups so you could have a bit of mouthwash... classy.   I should point out that I'm a pizza purist and prefer cheese or pepperoni or sausage or all 3, but not much else... I'm told that this place is great if you like a large variety of toppings. So take my review with that in mind.  I thought the dough was bland and dry and unappealing. Flavorless, but capable of holding up the thin layer of toppings. I imagine they skimp on toppings because you are supposed to order many many toppings. That probably explains why the bread is sturdy. Still, my friend's slice was loaded, but looked sparse as well.   The cheese was also completely flavorless even though they sprinkled some parm on the top. The pepperonis were okay I guess - I like them thicker and more spicy though. The sauce was flavorless as well... overall a pretty bland and boring pizza experience. It reminded me of Dominos flavor-wise (or lack thereof).  After eating, I was hanging out in the parking lot talking with my friend and my food suddenly hit me and gave me the shits - that's why I got a look at the bathroom. I wouldn't put money on it that it was definitely the pizza that gave me the browns, but it was the only thing I had eaten that day. It's entirely possible it wasn't the food though since I ate a bunch of candy the night before.   Anyway - everyone's taste in pizza differs... I'm not a fan, but you may be. This place gets a 2.5/5 from me - it's pretty average. More experimental foodies might love it. People who like simple pizza may want to look elsewhere.

Monroe's is a cool little basement bar in downtown Phoenix. Just by existing, it creates a sense that Downtown Phoenix isn't just a pathetic excuse for a city that was simply plopped on top of the desert. It gives the area character. It's one of those places that help make downtown feel more like a much cooler city that has an abundance of stuff like this.   You blink and you might miss it, but once you find the door and descend the stairway you'll find yourself inside a dark and cozy spot lined with old woods and bookended by a wrap-around bar and a stage where they sometimes have musicians play. The atmosphere is pretty inviting, but it helps if you bring a buddy so you don't feel like an outcast.   There are tables and chairs to sit at and the place is capable of accomidating groups. They serve food as well of course and the food is good. I've had pizza there and I thought it was quite tasty. Nothing to write home about, but I'll yelp about it.   It's the sort of place that sets the scene for "anything can happen" night... sorta like Chez Nous did, but in a different way. Definitely worth the trip.  edit: I went here last year, and I've learned it may be closed now (although a search on the web turns up nothing about closure)... definitely needs confirmation.

I stopped in here today and sampled the food and atmosphere. The owner (Tina, obviously) is one of the sweetest people I've ever met. The restaurant is small and cozy and eclectically decorated.   The food - now, I've never really eaten Ethiopian food. Tina had to kind of give me a quick instruction on it. She put the plate down and my first instinct was to take a photo (and now I wish I had) - it was beautiful. She explained that she makes her own bread - it's a special sort of bread that's almost like a cross between pancake and a European fluffy/spongy crumpet. Next to it is a smaller plate filled with sauce and meat and vegetables.   It looked a little messy, so I looked around for silverware. Silver-where? What? No silverware? I'm sure she had some, but she said I should eat with my fingers and told me how it works - using the bread to scoop up the meat and sauce. I had a bite of spicy chicken - OMG so good! Then I tried the ground beef - also OMG amazing!  I took some home for my girlfriend who didn't even wait until I got inside the house - she met me in the garage and scarfed down a bunch of it. She also thought it was delicious. We're definitely going to have dinner here soon.   I noticed a bunch of low reviews here and for the most part they are from people who didn't actually eat there or that bought an online coupon deal. I'm not going to bad mouth any daily deal site (sometimes they can help put a business on the map), but I can tell you that for a small business like this, it can be financially devastating doing a coupon or daily deal like this.   Restaurant owners are asked to sell something for half price and then only get to keep half of that. It's safe to assume they lose money every time they do one. Also, they don't see any money from it for months. Also, the coupon customers often only show up someplace when there's a coupon involved. Restaurant owners aren't coached on how to get these customers to come back in to pay full price.   And then to try to use an expired coupon and trash a tiny independent restaurant online when they won't accept it anymore - that's even more bad news for the restaurant owner. It just doesn't seem fair. I don't know. It seems like the opposite of supporting local to me.   This restaurant is cute and charming and the owner is awesome. The food is incredible, and I'm a super picky eater who won't eat anything. I'm a fan of Ethiopian now. Can't wait to go back.

It's so easy to miss this place as it is tucked in behind a McDonald's, but that's what we call "a hidden gem" in the biz... "the biz" being the business of finding rad little tucked away restaurants that serve good food.   I've eaten here twice over the last few years, and it didn't really register with me that it was the bomb for some reason... it was good, but I guess it was because it wasn't my neighborhood place back then. We recently moved closer to it though, so last night my girl brought me home a full cheesesteak. It was indeed "the bomb," and I realized that I should have put it on my list of great cheesesteak places a lot sooner (I don't have such a list yet, but if I did this would be on it for sure).  The meat was tender, seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Most cheesesteak places use roughly the same meat and cheese (in varying quantities), but beyond that, the differences will come down to how well they cook and season the meat, and what kind of bun they use. Here, they use a good ratio of meat to cheese to bread. Not too much cheese so that it's all over your hands and everything else - just enough for flavor. I might have to try it with a tiny bit more meat next time, but really it was plenty. Every bite was perfect end to end. The bread they use was soft and chewy. Some places give you dryer or harder bread - I prefer the softer stuff because it goes along better with the savoriness of the meat.  The few times I've been in there, it has been clean. The owners and staff are always really nice. I've tried talking them into doing delivery, but I don't think they're set up for that. Having eaten from here a handful of times now, I'm realizing that it's also been consistently good.   It's pretty safe to bring your friend from out of town who claims he can't get a decent philly and act like you've got the angle on the best kept secret in Phoenix. The truth is, there's nothing magical about the cheesesteak in general. It's not tough to make, and as I said the ingredients are roughly the same everywhere you go (like, the meat is probably literally the same product from the same distributor). It's easy to mess it up, but it's also not terribly complicated to do it right.   These places that brag about being the most authentic or legit or whatever are just blowing smoke. Also the idea that you can only get a good or authentic cheesesteak in Philly is absurd. I've had a few (one from the most famous place actually in Philly), and they're all about the same. I guess some places just achieve the highest level of greatness one can achieve with these simple ingredients, and then it just becomes a pissing match over who is more authentic or who is more from Philly or some other thing that doesn't matter.   This place serves among the best cheesesteaks in the Valley, and rivals the best I've had in Philly or anywhere else. I live closer now.... I'm going to get fat.

Comparable to Chipotle... better chicken and better pork, but the beef isn't as good. They actually make the tortillas from scratch right in front of you which is cool. I'm talking balls of dough flattened and then cooked. The chips are fresh too, but a little bland and boring - along with their salsa. I tried the 'hot' and it just tasted like a bean and butter sauce with no spice in it at all. Kinda gross truth be told...  If Chipotle was Port of Subs, then this place would be Quiznos - I guess that's a fancy way of saying that after they assembled my burrito, they toasted it. It was pretty nice. I ate every bite, so I guess it was good eh? They take the Chipotle thing one step further and you can garnish your aluminum take-out tray (yeah, even if you dine-in you're eating in take away containers - not so classy for a nice dinner, but fine for lunch) with beans or a salad or whatever you like.  This whole concept is pretty interesting - let's take a Mexican restaurant and cut out the waiters. It makes sense actually in quite a few ways (that I won't go into). People certainly don't seem to mind the cafeteria style dining since these places are always packed.   It's not going to be my favorite restaurant any time soon, and honestly if I'm driving this far for Mexican food I'm eating at Matta's. Still, it's very tasty... close second to Chipotle for this type of quickie sit-down meal.  On a side note - the strip mall it's in looks like it belongs in Dubai or something...

May 2014 - I've been eating Rosati's for years now, and I'm a huge fan. I realize now that I was spoiled by this location. I also realize I've been giving away 5 star reviews more liberally the last few years and back when I reviewed this as a 4, I was a lot tougher of a critic on places. Since I wrote the original review below, I have been to Chicago and have eaten at all of the famous deep dish places, and this Rosati's beats em. I'm not kidding.   Now the owner of this location has been here for years now, and he has done a fantastic job of staying consistent and awesome. I heard that new franchise owners go here to train. Not all Rosati's are created equal. Some are not up to par, but this location is the gold standard as far as I'm concerned.   Even though I moved out of range for this location, the one near my house was not that great - so when I got the craving, I would go miles out of my way to get pizza here. Perfect every single time. I've now moved again and am even further away - the Rosati's near my house is from the Corporate side, and is also really solid so I may not go as far out of my way as often anymore, but I still will occasionally.   Think of it this way - Rosati's prices aren't cheap, and most locations don't really have a sit-down experience that the food really deserves. This means to me that the ingredients quality is high. At locations where they stick with the program, it definitely is. This is one of them. Again - in my opinion, this is the gold standard for this franchise.   I'm upping it to 5 stars - and these are well deserved. I'm only sorry that I let this location sit at 4 stars for so long.   3/22/2009 - Rosati's is under new ownership. Apparently, it was going downhill fast under the previous owner near the end. Now it seems to have been rescued and revamped.   I haven't been inside, but I did order some delivery yesterday. I got a 12" Chicago style pizza... it was pretty damn good. It was a little spendy, but I'd say it was worth it. It fed me for two days. The pizza arrived hot, and the box it came in was actually pretty fancy for a pizza box.   Their menu is pretty nice. I spoke with the owner when I called to order and he told me about what he's been doing. He's definitely trying to raise the bar and elevate this place to another level. I think he said he bought a few other spots as well.   Since it's a little more pricey than Mama Mia's, I don't know how often I'll order from here, but it's a nice alternative. If you're a fan of Chicago pizza - this seems to be a solid place to get it.  I'll update this review after I've eaten here a few more times.  Edit: Okay, after eating here a few times, I'll say that I love their toppings, but the bread they use sucks. The pasta isn't terribly amazing either. It's good though. The delivery is fast and it arrives really hot and fresh. I'm still keeping it at 4 stars.

Great salads - especially their chicken Caesar. Their pizza is better than I remembered. They also have a delicious pizza bread appetizer that's good to split. The food here is above average for a chain, but as far as pizza places go it isn't remarkable.   There's nothing particularly special about this place. I've enjoyed the food and the service a little more at the Tempe location, but this one is in such a convenient spot. It gives you the opportunity to walk off your dinner while wandering around town looking at art galleries and whatnot.   I had realized that I gave this place a 4/5, but the review sounded like I kinda hated it. I also said this place wasn't as good as the Tempe location, but I think I gave that one a 3/5. Don't listen to me - I must not know what the hell I'm talking about.

Bar Smith has become quite a happening hot-spot in Downtown Phoenix. Several months ago, it was typically vacant and yet it oozed potential. Upstairs is where you want to be, but even then - it wasn't drawing much of a crowd. Now, it seems to be living up to its potential. I went here again tonight for Solstice (hosted by Tondra D.) which is held every Saturday and involves DJs, dancing, artists, and alcohol.   Downstairs is a 3 star affair and upstairs is a 5. Solstice really sells the place though... perhaps too well as it's very crowded by the time midnight rolls around. It's a bit of an eclectic scene, so I'm not sure what they're going for. I think it's because downstairs draws a different crowd and they feel compelled to wander upstairs to check it out.   Drink prices are a little high if you ask me, and the bathrooms aren't nice enough (or large enough) to warrant an attendant, yet there he is - handing me a towel and offering me gum and cologne and expecting a tip. Dude - you got to watch me piss... there you go... you're welcome.  My least favorite part about this bar though is trying to park downtown. I do think it's a cool place. I definitely like it better when it's not as busy, but Solstice on Saturdays is a great event if you like dancing elbow to elbow to great music on the rooftop patio under the stars.

This is the only location I've found that carries the one thing I actually like... it's the Chicken Caesar Salad Wrap. I love it. I've had the same thing elsewhere, and at other places the dressing pools or drips and makes me want to vomit. Somehow, they make it perfectly. I don't know why they don't carry it elsewhere, but they should.   I love that they give you a cookie and their fudge is unbelievable. I think they have great dessert treats, but their bread doesn't really impress me.   We used to have a great bakery in the valley when I was growing up... La Petite Boulangerie near the Biltmore. I loved that place... croissants filled with assorted jellies and chocolates and cheeses... soft rich buttery breads of all sorts... mmm. Sometime in 1993 or so,  La Petite Boulangerie was absorbed by Java City after a corporate merger and we never really got a suitable replacement that I'm aware of.   Every place I find sells shitty dry artisan breads. Why is that stuff so popular? It all tastes stale, isn't any better for you, and is difficult to chew.   The breads at Paradise don't thrill me either. I haven't tried their soups (cuz I'm not a soup person) and I'm not interested in their sandwiches (since I'm not into their bread). I would've given this place a 3, but I just love that wrap enough to give it an extra star (though it may not quite deserve it).   I'm still searching for a good bakery in the valley... I'll let you know if I find one.

Having eaten good Korean food, I have to say this wasn't very good. I wish it was because it's close and I'd like to have a good Korean food place close to me. The food was merely average or slightly below. I may have to give it another try though based on MJ K.s review. I might have just gone on a bad day.

This place is everything that sucks about Scottsdale and more. However... lord help me, I had a good time (even though I couldn't leave fast enough). We got there before 11 on a Friday which is apparently early enough because there was no line to wait in and no cover to pay. The place was relatively empty and we were able to order drinks right away.  The service was good and everyone was sweet to us. Everyone in the place was young, well dressed and attractive. It didn't quite seem as douchey as I've been lead to believe. It just seemed like a bunch of young people having a good time. I expected to see more Affliction shirts than I did, but there were some.   A large group showed up wearing golfing attire - this is apparently some new college thing that I'm too old to know about. They seemed to be having a blast dancing like fools. I honestly felt like the place wasn't trying quite as hard as other places in the area... there was just something a little genuine about it that set it apart.   The drinks were expensive, the music was loud, the place was dark, and there was a VIP area. If you're a hot girl and you want to get dressed up and go dancing - you could do worse than here. If you're a young guy and you want to dance with some hot girls, you could also do worse.   It's totally not my kind of place, but I can't see a reason to say it's a fucking horrible experience. I mean, if what they're peddling is what you are looking for - this place is great.   I hate it and I probably won't be back. It deserves 4 stars though for being only mildly pretentious and for providing a solid place where people can apparently have a good time. I'm giving this 4 stars, but I had trouble deciding between that and 2 stars. I may revise this review at a later date.

What the crap? I skimmed through all the reviews here of this place and I can't figure out what people didn't like about it.  Only 3 stars from most people? This place is so hip it hurts. It's what everyone wants - a little bakery/breakfast/market/coffeeshop sort of place. It was empty when I went there around 4pm on a Thursday, but this place probably gets slammed for lunch and breakfast.   Everyone wets their damn pants over Le Grande Orange and that place isn't so much more special than this. They appear to have really good food and the people there were all pretty nice and friendly. Now I really want to have a bad time there so I know what everyone's complaining about.   Anyway - only been there once, so apart from the name sucking - I like it and I'll try it again and revise my review later if things change.

I've seen many shows here, and I generally have a good time. The Clubhouse definitely brings me back 15-20 years to a time when this city actually had a scene and cool places to go see shows. I'm not going to start name-dropping though, so you'll just have to take my word for it.  My score of this place is probably heavily influenced by the quality of the bands I've seen perform here. As a bar, it's a bit of a filthy dive (which makes it a perfect candidate to host indie music events), but it's still cleaner and nicer than most places I've seen bands play (which says more about those places than this one). Clubhouse seems to land hosting duties for some really great bands though, so if you're a fan of good music you'll probably end up seeing a show here at some point  I can't imagine why anyone would come here just to drink, however, they definitely serve some strong drinks here. They also serve them in plastic cups so you really feel like you're at a classy joint. The bartenders can be nice and somewhat attentive if you tip well, but it's hard for them to hear your drink order so don't be surprised if you get the wrong thing.  The sound is usually above average for this type of club. Phoenix has always been known for having shitty sound at the club venue level, so even at their worst, they seem to provide pretty good audio here in comparison. If you forget your earplugs and you're old enough to care about such a thing, you'll hear the music just fine from behind the bar.  The layout of this place seems to work pretty well. The size is great now... it can really pack them in without losing a sense of intimacy - and as long as the band can draw at least 50 people, it won't feel vacant and empty. The place could definitely use more seating and a more regular deep clean, but it's tough to complain since it all just works.  Problems? Well, their system for tickets and entry can move a little slow, but it's about the same as any other place I suppose. Inefficiency is the norm. Out front by the door is where people go to smoke and it's nearly impossible to leave the venue without stinking of it.   Aside from those and a few other minor quibbles, it's a great place to see a show. Plenty of parking, good audio, stiff drinks, all-ages bar w/ ID, good bands, and enough of a dirty divey feel to bring you back to the good-old-days when music was good.

I've only been here to see bands play. For that purpose, it seemed to be a bit of an awkward setup. I would feel quite awkward trying to play a show here... it's much easier being a patron.   It is indeed small and divey as a venue and just divey as a bar. Every drink was served in plastic cups when I've gone - that might change on different nights. In the back, they had a Golden Tee which I jammed my finger on almost 2 years ago (and it's still fucked up), and which kept shorting out in the middle of the game. Irritating.   It can be a pain to get in and out of because you have to make your way through clouds of smoke and people trying to watch the band in order to belly up to the bar. Also, depending on how busy it is - it can take awhile to get served.  If you're going to see the band, you may want to note that the sound mix isn't the best. Also, the acoustics in the place aren't very good either. I do kinda like that it's not the easiest place to find. I also like that it's a weird setup. This place would rank pretty low on my list of favorable places to go see a band play, but I wouldn't necessarily avoid seeing a band I like just because they are playing here.

I want to know what kind of crack everyone that says this place is the bomb and has great food is smoking, and I want some for myself so that I may smoke it and become just as high.  The food presentation is great and the place is pretty chill. The servers are nice too. It looked like a Gap ad or something inside. They also had an interesting concept and a nice menu. The water had cucumber slices in it which was pretty nice as well. That's where the good times end though...  They have 80 half bottles of wine to choose from... Half bottles. Tiny little bottles that contain a little more than a glass each. Plus the prices are closer to a whole bottle... whatever. At least the food prices seem more reasonable.  The caesar salad we ate was composed of wilted lettuce and the dressing smelled a little off... did not finish. The "tater tots" we had were crispy and all, but they were undersalted and tasted like fake potato... did not finish. Finally, the sliders we had were charred nuggets of coal on the outside, but red and raw on the inside... completely fucking disgusting... did not finish. In fact, I started feeling quite ill halfway through one tiny burger.  And really - these are 3oz burger patties... how long does it take to cook these things? They obviously stuck them right into a raging fire until blackened and dry and then pulled them out before the middle was cooked enough to be safe to eat - that couldn't take more than a few minutes, right? The bread was stale too. I can tell you that these aren't sliders as much as they are bits of charcoal with a raw meat surprise inside... as long as it took for them to cook and bring these tiny disasters out to us, it's definitely going to take me longer to pass these stones - I actually debated heading straight to the bathroom to vomit them up dreading the thought of having to poo them out later.  The wait seemed excessive for everything really. The place wasn't even very busy - perhaps it was because our waitress was busy chasing down some out of town dick. I guess when you're paying nearly 70 bucks for two people (with one half-bottle of wine included), you expect things to go a little smoother than say a McDonalds... but seriously - even though it's been about a decade since I've eaten at McDonalds, I remember them having pretty good service and reliable food. Stax is like McDonalds, but 10x the price and 1/2 the quality.  This place has potential though, so judging from the other reviews - perhaps this was an isolated experience. Your mileage may vary. _______________________________  Edit: After writing this, I found out that I know the chef here... so now I feel bad. I hope he wasn't on duty when I ate there. I may give it another shot, but honestly it'll be tough since both my girlfriend and I got sick eating here. I've eaten his food before and he's really talented... this was simply awful though, so I'm just going to assume he didn't cook it.

Unlikely little neighborhood bar nestled in a grocery store-anchored strip mall. This place has the largest menu I've ever seen - it's presented in a 3-ring binder and they have everything you can imagine... wraps, salads, pizza, burgers, mexican, etc...   This place has been around for only 4 years, but it's developed quite a following. Many of the people there on any given day/night know each other. It recently went under new ownership and had a facelift. It's beach/surfer themed now... there are still buckets full of peanuts you can snack on - and don't worry about making a mess on the floor... that's what it's there for.   They have a free goallininc.com sponsored poker tournament twice a week and it's one of the more challenging and fun poker crowds in town. They also have 6 or 7 huge flat screens for sports and a digital download jukebox with plenty of good music available.  This place is great for familes and it's also great for locals and regulars - go once and you're a regular. The food is fantastic (but you might want to bring some Tums), and the prices are reasonable. The staff is friendly and drinks are fairly priced.  If you're in the area, it's worth a visit - and it's better than Zipps across the street.

A friend of mine and I were searching for a new neighborhood bar, so we checked out this place. It was a cozy little spot that was buzzing with a small local crowd. It was excellent people-watching and we felt pretty comfortable there. It just barely earns a 4 for lack of a 3.5 to score it, but it's definitely worth checking out. Easy-going atmosphere and not terribly noisy or crowded.

Hey Dragonfly - FUCK YOU!  We were starving and driving down Mill on a Saturday afternoon when this place caught our eye for the 9th time... we decided to give it a go. We had tried to eat there once before, but it was at night and it appeared to be some sort of techno dance club with a DJ instead of a restaurant. On this day though, they were open and actually quite empty. I love Vietnamese food, but my favorite place is in the ghetto and really far and I can't talk many people into going with me. There's a place near my house, but it sucks.  We walked into Dragonfly, stood at the hostess stand and skimmed the menu and quickly decided we were ready to sit down. There were two other tables of customers there and dozens of empty tables yet he sat us next to the shitter. DON'T FUCKING SEAT ME NEXT TO THE TOILET YOU DICK! I didn't say anything, but god that really bothers me.  Anyway - we were seated and then left alone... We read through the menu... three times. The prices were pretty high for Vietnamese food I thought, but I don't care as long as the food warrants it. The decor really wasn't winning me over... at least the bathroom door wasn't. The food on the menu seemed to be very accessible and non-traditional based on the descriptions. It was like American food with a Vietnamese presentation... I don't necessarily have anything against that as long as it's good.  So we continued to re-read the menus over and over again - discussing what we would eat if we could, but then we realized we had been seated there for a long time and nobody had even taken our drink order or given us waters. I mean, we didn't just walk in and seat ourselves - someone was working there - I swear it. If we had seated ourselves, I can guaranfuckingtee you we wouldn't have sat next to the can.  We continued to wait for about a half an hour with no drink, food, or sign of an employee - so we bailed and went to Big Fat Greek where they at least treat you like you exist.   I really wanted to eat at Dragonfly - honest - I really and truly did... they just wouldn't let me.

Four-letter-words:  You have been warned...  Shitty bar with shitty bar food. There are tons of video games, but honestly I'd rather play with my Xbox 360. It's a nice idea and people from my generation who grew up with arcades being a normal thing should be thankful they have a place to go that isn't golfland or chucky cheese or peter piper pizza - but seriously, this place is uncool and lame. Nothing hip about it. Granted, I went around 4pm on a weekday...  The games aren't anything special either. And worst of all, when I went the place was packed with kids. Fuck you, take your stupid asshole kids somewhere else so they can get their filthy booger-laiden sticky fingers on games I'm not going to touch. Chucky Cheese is your place, you dick... hell, they serve beer at Peter Piper too - so take em there instead. You're probably the same cunts that take your noisy retard kids to an R rated movie at 10pm.    You know, once when I was like 19 I went to Chucky Cheese with some friends because we thought it would be fun to relive our youth and such and we got thrown out because we didn't have kids with us... they should throw kids out of this fucking place. It's only fair.  The concept of D & B as I understand it is to give adults a place to play games and drink and whatnot. Poorly executed I think. Even the prize shop where you cash in your tickets (super lame idea to incorporate into such a place) had lame prizes.  I dated a girl for awhile who had friends that liked to go to Jillians on occasion. They were fucking dorks and that place was lame... Dave and Busters is lamer. Maybe I'm jaded because I miss the old glory days of arcades and pool halls... plus, I've been to E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) 5 times and that's pretty much like a Dave and Busters that's about 1000 times cooler and that takes up the entire Staples Center in LA.   Just think about all the most sophisticated video games and technology that hasn't been released to the public yet under one giant roof - they give you free shit and let you play games - celebritys show up - hot model girls dressed in slutty video game costumes pretend to like you - famous bands play live sets - the military shows up and shows off new high tech gear - and they usually have a half pipe where famous skaters do a skate demo.   After that, I guess it takes a lot to impress me. Dave and Busters won't cut it. Actually - I would've thought Dave and Busters was lame before I ever went to E3.. probably. Actually, Gameworks in Arizona Mills is cooler even though it's overrun with tweenage gangsters. I'm actually surprised I gave it 2 stars... it deserves 1.5 probably. It sucks... but go ahead and have fun there... don't listen to me.

Fuck it - I'm giving this place 5 stars.   It's far too easy to be a sushi snob I guess - which is funny since we're in Arizona - but I meet them all the time. It's also kinda funny to me how sushi-lovers love to hate sushi restaurants. It's like you ask a sushi fanatic where to go and they snidely scoff and mumble something about an exotic little place off the coast of wherever that they've probably only been to once if at all and suggest you might as well pick up a steamy dog shit off the lawn and eat that if you're going to eat at whatever place you were asking about.   I think it's meant to make the rest of us feel stupid for not being an expert. Well I'm a novice - I've only been to about a dozen different sushi places probably less than 50 times. I like the stuff, but I'm not from Japan or anything... I don't have it in my blood. I just know what I like and I tend to get the same or similar things wherever I go.   So given my experiences with sushi places and restaurants in general, I have to say this place is great. The servers were friendly and attentive, the decor was nice and kinda swanky without being overdone, the music sucked but wasn't too loud, and the food was quite good. If that doesn't make a 5 star joint, I don't know what does.  We had a roll and a teriyaki chicken dish from the menu along with a small bottle of sake that we bombed. Everything was crazy good. Oh, and we had edemame as well. The roll was pretty huge compared to most places and the chicken dish was ridiculously huge. For all the food we had, the prices were pretty reasonable.   To be honest, I expected this place to suck. The location, the outside, the name, etc... it all kinda gave the impression this wasn't going to be any good. Well, it was... so I guess... don't judge a book by its cover?   This isn't a chain, it doesn't smell fishy inside (at least it didn't when I was there), and it's clean. Compared to places like zen32 or stingray, this place holds its own. I think it kicks Ra in the ass - and I kinda like Ra okay. I ventured into the bathroom and it was clean and nice, but a little hodge-podgey (2 different styles of sink)... nice though... and clean.   I was actually a little shocked to see so many negative reviews after enjoying it so much... I guess that's the beauty of this site - it's all opinions, so nobody gets to be "right" and nobody has to be "wrong." If you're like me and you enjoy your Americanized sushi restaurant grills, you may really enjoy this. If you're a sushi genius, your mileage may vary.

Super-nice staff... our server was attentive and friendly.   The decor/ambiance... well, it looks nice. As we walked up to it, we noticed a very fishy smell - that's never a good sign at a fish restaurant. However, we noticed on our way in that they had some oysters sitting on some ice at the bar and we decided to believe that's where the odor was coming from and not the actual entrees. Our menus were even fancy and clean and had today's date printed on them, so we knew we were getting some fresh shit. Overall, we were pretty impressed.   Now, I'm usually at a loss at fish restaurants since I'm more of a deep-fried cod and chips sort of guy. Most foo-foo fish places think the fish doesn't need any sauces or spices. To me, most fish tastes about the same - like not much. It's all about texture basically. Anyway - I had the Halibut and it was tasty - although a bit dry. It was also pretty expensive for a restaurant located in a mall built mainly for college kids at 26 bucks - though it did come with two "sidekicks" (which i assume refers to the fact that they will feel like a baby in your belly kicking your sides and squirming for the rest of the night).  They brought us some bread to snack on and it was great sourdough (the butter pats looked like 6 pack abs). The mac and cheese sidekick was very tasty and the fries weren't so bad. I mean, there's really not much else to say - I got great service and ate my food until I was bursting. The only drawbacks were the price and the Halibut was a tiny bit dry (but still good). I tasted the Salmon as well and that was prepared perfectly (but I don't like salmon).   I like this place better than Wildfish simply because this joint lacks the pretension you get with the type of patron it attracts. King's is very nearly a 5 star... I look forward to hitting this place up for a happy hour sometime to save some bucks. I'm also looking forward to getting some shrimp or scallop dish.

So very nearly a 3 star - this place is 2.5 (why can't yelp do half-stars like flixster?)... the place is a conceptual hodge-podge priced for the super-rich. I felt uncomfortable there - but a lot of that has to do with my occasional social anxieties. Still, Canal oozed pretentious asshole (present company excluded). I can't even call it douche because douche can't afford this place on their waiter wages.   Even if I had this kind of money, I wouldn't go here ever... it's just not for me. I liked some of the concepts and the runway and curtains looked kinda neat... but then the exposed pipes on the ceiling looked like a cross between cool and gross as some of them appeared to be sewage lines - why would I want to have a meal with sewage lines running along the wall right next to my plate?   The menu was also this odd hand-made confusion... everything about this place was one-off. Even the appetizers had attitude - a simple bacon and cheese finger sandwich clearly aspired to be more. It was delicious, but c'mon. I didn't drink anything - I simply had a diet coke. The server was very nice, but brought my coke out with a huge lemon slice on the rim which left seeds in my drink. Odd. It's relatively new though, I'm sure the kinks will get ironed out over time.   I'd like to see a fancy-pants place like this serve a turd pate - like plate up the shit they scoop out of shrimps and garnish with mint leaves - and charge 80 bucks for it... I bet people would eat it and pay for it. Bah.   Sarah and I wandered around the mixed shops and arrived at the end before realizing it was more than one store. They all sold the same crap - most of it was grossly overpriced. Again - this goes beyond douche - the clothes were more stylish and simple and much more expensive than douche can afford. To be honest, much of it was quite nice -but still, if I had a billion dollars, I'd feel like a fraud paying 800 bucks for a casual jacket or 300 bucks for a t-shirt. Wasteful.   I am surprised that this sort of thing has permeated this far south - I thought it was a North Scottsdale thing. I'm discouraged because I don't like the crowd this sort of place will attract, but at the same time I like what it'll do to my property value. The reputation Scottsdale has really bums me out because I live here and I love it here. There are so many places to go where you don't have to encounter the douche-ness. It's just becoming increasingly more difficult to convince anti-Scottsdale people to come. Eventually everyone here will be bobble-headed plastic robots with too much money and no taste... I'll be consumed or assimilated or destroyed.  I do have a feeling that the bottom will fall out and this mansion of cards will crumble to the ground - Scottsdale is living beyond its means. Or perhaps 'if you build it, they will come' is the thinking. This is a strange time indeed.   It was my first Yelp event and I realize Sarah and I were antisocial - I attribute much of it to the setting... which was unsettling.

I ate here a few weekends ago. That night I think we were drugged at a bar by a 6'5" tall bartender in hotpants short shorts and a cutoff half-shirt because we blacked out nearly everything from that evening. I do remember a few things from that night though...   Specifically, I remember peeing in the bathroom here. Couldn't tell you what it looked like, so I suppose that means it was relatively clean. I also remember standing in the restaurant waiting for our order to come. I don't remember how we got to the destination, but I do sort of remember opening my white Styrofoam takeout container and seeing the beefy cheesy thing I ordered... or at least I think I ordered.   I'm pretty sure I ate it, but I couldn't tell you anything beyond that. I'm sure I liked it okay because I want to go back and eat again. Everyone else I was with seemed to like it as well - those who can remember the evening anyway.   It's possible we were drugged and had disgusting sex acts performed on us - we would have no idea... I don't think we were drugged at Amados, and that's always a plus when a restaurant doesn't drug you.   I woke up in my own bed and didn't have any sort of gut rot from eating the food. We went swimming right after eating apparently, and nobody reported that I threw up or crapped in the pool, so that's another good sign. Good Mexican food is hard to find, so I hope this place lives up to the hype on my second visit.

Pleasantly surprised... that's how I would describe my experience at this posh Mid-North Scottsdale Asian inspired restaurant. I was here for a Yelp event, so money wasn't an issue... price seems to be a deterrent for many people, but honestly - we had 5 menu items and two drinks each, and the bill was below 80 bucks for both of us (it was free, but we asked how much it would've been). That's pretty reasonable. We was expecting it to be much more.   The ambiance was pretty fancy-pants... a little too fru-fru for my tastes, but it was nice inside. Great wood-top bar with clean lines and modern touches inside. The evening started out very bright and well-lit and then during service the lights turned down to suit the mood. Outside, the building is unassuming and dull like any other shitty NoSco strip mall looking thing, but inside is a much different story. It's an open and airy space.   On to the food... holy shit. Fucking delicious. I would've ordered none of what I ate - ever. None of it pleases my pallet on paper, but I was brave and popped it all into my mouth and enjoyed every scrumptious bite. Our server happened to be fantastic, but our friends had a different experience. I think your mileage may vary here as far as service goes, but the food is very good.   By the way... I peeked into the bathroom, and I have no idea how a 5'9" woman could sit on a toilet here and her feet wouldn't touch the ground - that's absurd.   This probably won't ever be my first or second or third choice for a place to go for a good meal and a drink, but honestly I may consider going here sometime even if I have to pay. My biggest problem with the place would be that I wouldn't know what to order. I liked that we didn't really have a choice in this particular case.   I don't know who this place would appeal to... because it's really not meant for people like me. I'm more at home at British Open Pub (which is where we went afterwards), but judging by the non-yelper crowd there, I would say wealthy Scottsdale and Paradise Valley people in the area between 30 and 60 would really enjoy this joint. Maybe the crowd changes to younger folk on the weekends. But even though it's not my kind of place, I had a good time and would recommend it to someone who asked if it was good.

Good lord, what a joke. The first thing I see as I approach is a reserved section next to the handicapped parking labeled "Hybrid Only" parking... okay, fine. They're really pushing the idea of them being "Earth Friendly"... pfft, don't make me laugh. We wander in and start looking at the generic looking products lining the shelves. "Shipped in from France." What? How much gas did that take? "Shipped fresh from Costa Rica." Ha! I'm sure that's cheaper and more Earth Friendly and fresher than just using local or even just closer suppliers.   Another thing we noticed as we walked through the two sets of triple sliding glass electric doors (very earth conscious and frugal) was that it was below 60 degrees inside. There are seriously big thick jackets for the employees to wear at the check stands. How much resources does it waste to keep it this cold? Especially in Arizona. I'm sure with all the CFCs being released, this place has a bigger energy footprint than a suburban block full of homes. Environmentally friendly, my dirty asshole.   Perhaps the worst offense, aside from the fact that nothing is made here and instead is shipped in, is that it's all packaged in excess plastic. Everything is wrapped in plastic and in plastic trays. Even apples... I can't pick an individual apple, I have to get a little family of four and their little house too. I guess I could recycle it (if it didn't have a paper sticker on it - oops). Also, I get that part of the appeal here is the organic fad so there aren't any preservatives, but seriously - it seems like everything here expires like tomorrow. Not so Fresh, eh?  Let me just hop in my Hybrid and head across town past 6 other grocery stores to the Fresh and Easy market where I can wander around in a frozen tundra environment grabbing food that's minutes away from expiring after being flown or shipped in from other countries on massive gas guzzling planes or ships then across our country in gas guzzling big rigs. Then I can check myself out and bag my own shit in plastic bags because the luxury of having someone else do it makes me feel useless after a long day at work. Then I can go home and really feel good about myself and the positive effect I'm having on the environment.   In their defense, the bags are reportedly 50% recycled material and they urge you to drive all the way back to the store so they can recycle them (they won't re-use them, but they'll send them out to be recycled - as far as I know, plastic bags aren't recyclable).   We bought fixins to make a pizza... I should've just gone to DeFalco's and bought the shit. There was a lot of stuff they just didn't have - they JUST got Pepperonis apparently (and they were just Gallo that you could get at any store). In fact, half of what they sell is their own Easy branding which is pretty generic looking (something I'm perfectly fine with). The other half is just the same shit you can get at any grocery store.   Their prices are pretty decent - I'll give them that. If they had one right down the street from me, I would probably shop at it once in awhile... and fill out comment cards frequently about their flagrant hypocrisies. Overall though - don't be fooled - this place is bullshit.

I've worked in this mall. I've been kicked out of this mall. I've hung out at this mall. I've shopped at this mall. I have early childhood memories of this mall. Mall mall mall, mall mall... mall.   Yet another Westcor joint... this place has gone through many facelifts and is set to go through yet another soon. I don't really shop here much anymore, but I find it to be very easy to navigate and park at and find exactly what I want.   I get a very nostalgic feeling from this place whenever I go. Usually years go by between visits and I'm always surprised both at seeing the new stores and changes made as well as how much it has stayed the same. Most of my favorite stores have long split the scene. No matter how much things change here or what comes or goes, there's always something for everyone here.   I suppose when I'm 70 if I still live here in the valley, I'll probably start walking around the mall at 5am until it opens... do they still do that? I don't know.

Edit: Since I reviewed this place, it has become something else and I can no longer recommend it. I'll leave my original 4 star review in tact, but I'm taking away 2 of the stars to reflect the current state of the place - overpriced pretentiousness. I'm taking away one more star because they kept the name and ditched the no-brainer existing and working formula. My review of the new place is elsewhere here on Yelp.   Here's my original review of the original restaurant - sad to see it gone:  Fantastic breakfasts - a little on the greasy side, but it's a neat little greasy spoon in old town Scottsdale. It belongs in Seattle or Minnesota really. It's certainly a favorable alternative to a breakfast at The Breakfast Club. The staff isn't quite as pretty (but so what?) and the food is a little bit more greasy (but it's oh so good). You don't have to get dressed up to go to breakfast like you do in some of the downtown scottsdale places which is nice.   It beats going to Denny's and it's reliable for some good food... you can't go wrong here and the crowd is diverse and make for great people-watching. Sometimes it gets really busy, but the wait usually isn't too bad.

I must agree with Scott S, but I should point out that I'm probably even less qualified to write a review of this place as I didn't eat here... I merely wandered in and right back out.   Gone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.  Replacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.   I'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer.   It's true - I haven't eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go. The empty seats told me the story anyway. Before I left, I told the hostess to put it back the way it was.   I plan to actually have a meal there sometime and then post a proper review... until then, this will have to do.

A small group of us went here to eat several weeks ago... they weren't so busy that there was a wait, but the table we wanted outside was still dirty. We were tired and starving so we sat down anyway after they promised to have it cleaned straight away.  20 minutes later, nobody had offered to take our drink order, but we managed to get someone to take most of the disgusting plates off of our table. We had asked a few people to send someone out to take our order and the table next to us that had been seated after us had gotten menus and drinks.   They must've not understood that we were new customers even though the hostess knew, the waiter whos section it was new, and the bus boy and bartender both knew as well because we told them. I guess the filthy plates of half-eaten food and slime were tricking them.   The five of us sat there trying to talk over the sounds of our gurgling stomachs as we waited for about a half hour without menus, drinks or any indication we were going to get served... finally, an off-duty employee came out and asked us if we had been served. We said no and that we were leaving and he flipped out. He said he wasn't on the clock so he couldn't help us, but he would try to flag someone down immediately.  In the end, the place smelled very fishy (which you should know is a bad sign when eating at a fish restaurant - especially sushi) and we decided to just split and get food elsewhere. Between the fishy smell and the non service, there wasn't much keeping us there.  The place looked kinda nice and I'm sure we just had an isolated experience - but until I actually try again and get some food and service, this will have to be my review - one star. If the place had been ultra packed, I might have forgiven this a little more.

I struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4. Honestly, I'm not happy with my decision and I'm thinking it may deserve a 3. This place is new to me, but I'm no stranger to "Mongolian BBQ" as I've been a long-time fan of YC's. Obviously I'm going to compare the two.   I liked that they had fresh meat, but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen, it takes longer to cook your food. They seem to stack up orders on the hot disc. It definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at YC's, but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway. Plus, I know it's wrong, but I prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks. It's just different though - I wouldn't say frozen is better, just that I prefer it.   I would even go so far as to say I preferred a lot of their fixin's outside of the meat. They had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than YC's, and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more. They also had better vegetables. I should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops. Even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive. Come to think of it, they really beat the shit out of YC's hands down in the available food department.  And taste? Well, it was delicious I must say. Of course, I assembled the dish, so if it wasn't any good I have to accept at least part of the blame if not all. If I had to compare, I'd say YC's is very reliable and good consistantly because I tend to always create roughly the same dish. GG's I could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences.   The ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant. It was kinda kitschy, but charming enough and fairly comfy. They had attention to detail. I think YC's (depending on which one you go to) is a "no frills" sort of place compared to this. They were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well... for a minute, I thought someone had lifted my ipod.  Service was attentive, but odd since this is a "get your own food" kind of place... They also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail. I felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious, but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face, so maybe it's a good thing they do that. Regulars probably just get escorted over to the line.  I think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin's... but then again, you aren't putting noodles or rice in there like you do at YC's - they add that as they cook it for you. So I suppose the portions are comparable. Then there's the price. A little high perhaps - maybe higher than YC's (I know they used to be 5 bucks for a lunch bowl). But you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl.   So I guess I was right to give it a 4 instead of a 3... turns out I really liked it. I think this would be a real treat for someone who hasn't had Mongolian BBQ before. I consider this to be a great alternative to YC's... Impressive.

Great idea, but fail execution.  Well... I don't know about great, but it is certainly an interesting idea. Almost clever.   Going here was my friend's idea - it was either this or get that gastronomical abomination from KFC where they give you a bacon and cheese sandwich and then replace the bread with deep fat fried chicken. I don't like KFC, so I went with this. My choices might as well have been a kick in the face or a stomp on the nuts.  I didn't know what to expect. We walk past the ambulance into the restaurant. The air was thick inside. Oily. I quickly notice that everyone is wearing hospital gowns while devouring their meals. If peopleofwalmart.com was a movie - this would be the cast.   We found ourselves seats and were greeted by a sweet young girl who put a hospital wristband on us and then came around to put on our gowns. The place is staffed with cute girls in nurse costumes. I look down at the menu and the choices are called bypass - the severity varied by how many slabs of meat they put on. It was all kind of fun at first.  I ordered the lightest thing on the menu - a single 1/2 pound burger - also an order of fries (which are unlimited refills) and a water... outside of water, my choices are sugar drinks or beer. My friend ordered a Double Bypass which was a pound of meat, also fries and also beer.   The fries were cooked in lard - they didn't taste too bad, but were not crispy or special at all. They just weren't worth getting up for seconds. Soggy, floppy and flavorless... just something to deliver salt to my stomach.  The burger arrived in a paper tray looking like a sad heap of grease. The bun was glistening - soaked with grease. Butter? Lard? Motor oil? I couldn't be sure, but the first bite told me I didn't want a second. I peeled the top bun from the burger and plopped it in the tray. I attempted to take another bite or two, but couldn't take it. The meat was sub-par shitty, fatty grocery store beef. The cheese was cheap tasting as well.   Not that I expected wine and caviar, but for food this cheap and shit tasting, I wouldn't expect to pay so much.   I didn't eat more than a few bites of the burger and I didn't touch the fries much, but I still felt both full and hungry at the same time. I pretty much just ate a few pickle slices and drank a bottle of water. The waitress asked how I liked it - my friend loved it and said he would've had seconds. I said it was terrible and that I was dissatisfied. I didn't ask for any money off the bill and she didn't offer it either.   Even though I didn't eat it, she charged me 12 bucks or whatever it was. I wasn't entitled to not having to pay or anything - I mean, I ordered it. I should've known what I was getting into. Still, many restaurants would've bent over backwards to make me happy. I can't really bust them down a star for this, but even if I could there's no option for negative stars.   Heart Attack Grill served me one of the worst burgers I've ever had. The novelty of it wore off as soon as my food arrived. If you want to eat an unhealthy yet savory burger/fries meal - go to in'n'out burger.  I will never eat here again. I like greasy food sometimes, but I would rather eat a stick of butter and wash it down with bacon grease. Seriously - fuck this place.   Then again... my friend loved it, so you never know.

Crust is kinda hidden and I didn't really know what to expect when going in... I was surprised to see so many reviews on file here. It's tucked away behind a grocery store. I've eaten at the sushi place next door before, but I think that was before Crust moved in.   Anyway, I was in here today to speak with one of the owners and left with a giant pizza. It looked too delicious to not take one home. You can see the giant open mouth oven with a giant flame toasting up the goodness as you walk in. They were making some interesting odd-shaped pies and their toppings looked high quality. Of course, they hand-toss.  The decor was really nice and I definitely want to come back to have a sit-down dinner. They have a Gelato bar in the corner as well and it took every ounce of strength for me not to order up some of that too... gotta watch my weight, right? The staff was all really nice and the part-owner was really cool.  When I got home with my pizza, it was still really hot and gooey... gotta love how well pizza travels in Arizona. Giant flavorful pepperonis and huge chunks of fresh juicy pineapple covered the pie and the sauce was very unique - they apparently bottle it up for sale.   It's a little on the spendy side, but you definitely get what you pay for. I'm a fan now and this only goes to further solidify my belief that Arizona is one of the best places in the country to find awesome pizza.

This review will deal mainly with their bike section...  I recently bought a bicycle for someone from here. The bike section guy was knowledgeable and courteous and experienced. I found the bike online and called in to see if they had it - they did and they pulled it aside and held it in the back for me. When I got there, it was parked behind the employee only doors looking like it was on display just for me. It was a totally perfect experience.  I have had many arguments with bike enthusiasts and hipster snobs about buying bikes at Target - I always maintained that if it gets you from A to B, then a Target bike was just fine for some people. I said you didn't need to go to some fancy bike shop and pay through the nose to get a bike.   Well, now I have to retract my previous statements a bit I suppose. Watching this bike expert prop this bike up and secure it in the air at his workstation so he could fine tune the gears and double-check every nut and bolt, the tension of the brakes, the balance of the wheels and every spoke - it was eye-opening. This guy was thorough.   I started talking to him about Target bikes and he said that it turns his stomach every time he sees someone walking up to the checkout counter with a bike in their cart. Later that week, I went to Target and saw a couple with their kids - the mom was pushing a cart with a kid's bike in it and the other kid was pushing his new Christmas bike up to the counter right past the bath towels section.  It's not like I wasn't aware there was an art to putting together a bicycle... My sister used to be into fancy bikes and I would go with her to the bike shop all the time to watch them in action as a kid. I've known that there's a difference between a real bike and a toy, but it's a pretty big difference.   Now, I still think you can pick up a crappy Target bike and it'll basically work just fine - especially if you aren't really going to use it much. I mean if you're only going to ride your bike once or twice a year, who gives a shit? However, now that I see the work that goes into a bike over at Sports Chalet - when it costs only about 50 bucks more, it's well worth it. I won't ever buy a bike from Target.  So basically, I'm eating my stupid words. Target bikes suck. If you don't want to spend a lot of money on a bike, but you still want something nice that was put together by someone who knows what the hell they are doing - spend a few extra bucks and get something from Sports Chalet. I still say leave the fancy bike-shop bikes to the serious enthusiasts though.  As for the rest of this store... it has pretty much everything you could want sports-related. I can't really say they have the best prices ever, but it's a nice clean store with a decent selection and knowledgeable staff. Their checkout system is a little stupid, but it's no biggie.

Nice atmosphere, really nice staff, and good food...    I was with a friend of mine who is in-lawed to one of the chefs here, so we were able to sample quite a few dishes. Most of it was delicious... they really like pork and salt and sauce. That's kinda my impression of the food. Salty, porky, saucy.   The menu kinda turned me off - both in terms of prices and fancy-pants-ness. The food tasted a lot better than it sounded (to me) though, and that's all that counts. This really isn't my kind of place, but I can see the appeal. It's nice.   I had an absinthe and with all the fancy prep, it didn't really taste all that fancy. It tasted like it does any place else. Drinks are really pricey here. I guess if you're eating here, you don't really give a shit about money though.

The best Gelato in Phoenix?   Quite possibly...   I don't really eat much of the stuff. It's definitely a rare indulgence for me, but I do always love to try new Gelato places. This one is opening up right next door to Mamma Mia Pizza (which is also gaining a new much-needed professionally designed dining area).   Mamma Mia Gelato features original and unique hand-made gelato and other tasty creations. The owner has a passion for feeding people good food. He has poured his heart and soul into this place, and it shows.   It's not technically open yet, but I was able to go in and sample several flavors. Everything I had was dangerously delicious. If you're a fan of the pizza, you'll be a fan of the cold stuff too. I think the grand opening is November 1st. Do yourself a favor and sample a few flavors... I think they plan to always have something new.  There are a lot of pizza places around the valley that are either next to or that serve ice cream or gelato. Whoever came up with the idea of pairing frozen sugar-loaded sweets with carbs and cheese is a twisted evil genius.

I've been coming here forever, but I always forget it's there. The layout of this place is great, though it suffers during the week when the place is empty. In other words, you really notice when there aren't enough people here. When it's busy or packed, it's highly entertaining.   This is the kind of bar where you're likely to see a fight break out. It's also the kind of bar where you're likely to have some decent luck making out with a random if that's what you're looking for. Everyone here at least seems to be looking for fun (in whatever form that may come) - what more could you ask for?   People love to dance here. Clumsy drunk ladies seem to gravitate towards the "stripper pole" like flies to fly paper and make complete asstards of themselves by ending up on the floor half a dozen times while trying to look sexy. The dudes in here range from cheesy Scottsdale club dudes who didn't manage to get lucky at the nightclubs to what appear to be buff tattooed skinheads. The girls range from classy to skeezy, but everyone in here seems reasonably attractive and down to earth. It's at least a good girl to guy ratio.  We even saw a 70 year old man with white hair (who could probably put us both in headlocks) dancing the night away with ladies 1/3 his age. It's a perfect mix for whatever your needs are... if you want to people watch, it's amazing.   Watching people walk up to each other and just start playing grab-ass or making out, you would think they were dating - but you never know. The love seems to flow freely here. It's just a really unique vibe. People seem to leave their insecurities elsewhere when they come. The bartenders aren't the most attentive or nice when it's busy, but I'm sure they get a lot of assholes in there. I imagine if you're a slow night regular, you'll get preferential treatment when they see you.  The patio is practically indoors - in fact, it's tough to notice you're "outside" unless it's daytime or it's raining. This is about as close to smoking indoors at a bar as you can come, and when you combine that with beer pong, loud music, random dancing, random hookups, casual atmosphere and cheap bottle beers - what you get is very similar to a great American working class backyard summer house party. It can get pretty trashy, but it's tough not to have a good time. Plus, it's a nice change of pace from the rest of the bars and clubs in the area.  It's not the coolest place ever, but it's definitely underrated.

It's been awhile since I've eaten here, but I keep meaning to return. This is a nice little italian spot... the food is great and the atmosphere is nice. When we went, the owner's family was there - I felt like I had stepped into the middle of a mafia movie... and not one of the scenes where people get peppered with bullets and blood flies everywhere like spaghetti sauce.  It was a nice mafia family with young kids running around near the kitchen. Normally, that would annoy me - but this was more fun than annoying.  White tablecloths, great bread and wine, and lovely food. I'm glad I remembered this place so I can go back. Stay tuned for a review update if my next visit is any different...

I have a bias.... I have been living in the valley for a long time and this place now resides in the spot that was once The Famous Door. That place was the shit... for a long time. Coming here even reminded me of how the spot next door used to be The Downside Risk - a cool stock exchange themed restaurant/bar. Both of these places did good business and since they were changed to something else, neither have seen any sort of success.   I used to love Downside Risk - I would go there with my father who was ill (terminal cancer) and have beer battered chicken and drinks. It's one of those places that means something to me emotionally. So going to the former Famous Door strikes a chord. Seeing the joint (whatever it is now) empty on a Friday night is just sand kicked in the face since they might as well have kept it as the Downside Risk.   With Lyte though, they seemed to be doing something right... Basically, they opened it up from the Famous Door days, and the place is now fairly clean and swanky. It seemed a little too "Scottsdale" to me - i.e. "fancypants" - but it's a nice spot. They have some nice comfy booths that would be fantastic for groups of friends and a large enough dance floor/mingling area. My only complaint would be that the booths and curtains should be darker - similar to Chez Nous - to pull in a bit more of an eclectic crowd rather than trying to attract the d-bag/botard scene.  The food was a mixture of fantastic and kinda bad. I'd say we had enough amazing food that we can forgive the not-so-great parts of it. The drinks were fine - I was the only one in my group that had mixed drinks, and mine were kinda weak. Aside from that, I heard no complaints. The service was good too - the girls working here are all extremely attractive. I wouldn't suggest coming here to hit on the staff, but if you want something pretty to look at while you're having a drink, then this is definitely a good spot. I think the girl who served me called me "sweetheart..." it was sweet. I hope my girlfriend doesn't mind.  Since I was here for an event, I'm not sure my assessment of the place is completely reliable, but based on what I saw from a non-event perspective, I'd say this is a decent club. I think it could be a place for the cool kids to go who want to get away from the cunts who hang out across the lot at Axis and Myst. It's even nice enough for me to forgive the fact that their existence is only possible because of the death of The Famous Door.   Go check it out...

This theater remains one of the last remnants, a leftover reminder of what Fashion Square once was. It wasn't always so posh. No, Fashion Square used to be kinda low-rent rather than fancy pants. It used to be packed with kids ditching school, anchored by a fuckin' Sears and you even used to be able to smoke inside. Before that, it was originally a small somewhat open-air 3 story building anchored by a grocery store and a mid-level clothing department store.   Today Fashion Square is more of a destination for tourists looking for a swanky desert oasis shopping experience and a place for the wealthy and financial elite to escape the proletariat masses. It's The Mall of America of the Southwest.  Given the transformation Fashion Square has gone through, it's clear this Harkins theater needs to be redone or removed. It'll take more than a facelift. This theater sticks out like a whore in church not just as a contrast to the mall it lives in, but also among other Harkins Theaters that speckle the valley. It's one of the worst examples left...   To be honest, it was never a very good theater. Many of the screening rooms are tiny and they clean it about as well as an 8th grader cleans his room. Sticky floors, empty wrappers, and a layer of crud on everything that you could scrape off with your fingernail - the crud probably being a mixture of milk dud coating, fake butter flavoring, and dead skin.   The location is awful - it's stuck at the end of the food court. When there's a sneak preview, they have everyone line up on the upstairs walkway in the mall... not the best way to save a spot in line if you're handicapped and have to take the elevator. If there's a big movie out and somehow everyone wants to see it in this shit-hole, they have you spilling out into the food court dining area creating a traffic nightmare and a bit of a mess.   What they need to do is remove a few theaters and expand the lobby so people can wait inside... they could also expand the small theaters. 5 screens is enough... Actually, a better use of the space would be to fill the theaters up with garbage and then fill in the Lobby and hallway with cement and turn the front into a Cinnabon or something.

As far as I know, this place is still a scary but quiet local ghetto dive located next to a ghetto Circle K and a ghetto laundromat. I used to live in the area and had my car stolen twice from my apartment complex - on the nicest part of this block. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but spanish-speaking or bilingual locals. I still stop at the Circle K once in awhile, but apart from having a cool dive bar name I think this tiny strip is worthless.   I'm almost scared to give this place a 1 star review - like the bar is going to come after me or something. Actually though, the people I remember hanging out at this place seemed pretty nice and low-key... just hard working folks trying to get a beer. Really, I just wanted to add this business and not review it - but that wasn't an option.

This place is a bit hidden, but it's a great place to snag a quick drink if you're going to be in the area anyway since it's next to Axis/Radius and Suede. I haven't sampled the food here, but browsing the menu I'd say the prices are a bit high for my budget. They do have bargain snacks late nights though for those of you who like to party at the nearby dance clubs.   There's not much I can complain about here - I was treated nice, the seats were comfy, and the drink was tasty. I don't know that it would be my type of place to grab a drink, but I'm more of a British Open Pub sort of guy... this place is a bit fancy and more pricey than I'm into - I'm actually afraid that this place and others like it are going to have hard times ahead with the recession... we'll see. It's a nice area of downtown and it's a nice bar. Make it your starting/meeting point or your final destination... and sample the food and let me know if it's any good - the bartender told me it's excellent.

This is the latest Best Buy location in the valley. Most people are familiar with the store and this one sticks to the formula. This is a huge building, but it feels like a big empty warehouse rather than a store full of goodies. A lot of stuff is out of stock and this particular Best Buy simply doesn't carry everything that most of their stores carry.   I waited awhile to review this one because I thought I would give them some time to see if they would eventually fill out. Nope. It's still sparse on many things. Many of the items they have on display they don't even carry stock of and many of the items Best Buy sells aren't even sold at this location.   I gave this location one star, but all of the things wrong with this site only knock off one star from Best Buy in general... the average example of the store would earn only two stars. My problems with Best Buy as a concept exist at this particular location as well - smarty-pants employees who are either rude and condescending or "special" in a retarded sort of way.  Corporate gives the employees study materials on new products and the information is often flawed or wrong or incomplete leading to the employees having bad information or else having no clue at all. This means that when you ask a blue shirt to help you in your television selection, they will give you crap information with confident bravado and if you disagree, they act like you're a moron and dismiss you with righteous impunity. Either that or they act confused and helpless.  When the store has no customers besides you and you're wandering around the store, you are approached every 20 seconds by someone asking if you need help finding anything. Leave me alone! Ack!  One of the most annoying things about Best Buy in general for me is how they must police my purchase. It's like - "welcome to our store, please feel free to browse and touch and buy whatever you want... on your way out, we're gonna frisk you like the dirty thief you are." I just bought this shit 10 feet from here - right over there *points*... you WATCHED me buy it. Why should I have to submit to a search and receipt scrutiny?   I'd say the very best example of a Best Buy would earn 3 stars - I just don't like their business model... but this new spot is among the worst examples. This store annoys me - I shop online for pretty much everything and I pay less.

Three flights up from The Big Bang basement bar, The Library street level bar, and on the roof of Hooters is the icing on the college bar cake stack. Once you step inside and begin to catch your breath (assuming you're a sad old fuck like me and get at all winded from scaling three flights of stairs), you'll feel instantly at home (if home to you feels like a moderately nightclubby rooftop college bar on Mill Ave.).   The inside is all black, but they spared us from the excessive black lights that illuminate your fabric softener making you feel like everyone can see your body is covered in dandruff. There's a big open dance floor that spans the length of the room along the bar leading to an outside patio. The walls are lined with a college version of swanky white comfy seating with curtains to make you feel like a VIP.   We were allowed to sit in a velvet roped off VIP area, but told that we would only have to move if someone "bought it." We were soon to find out how unlikely that would be...  The Dj arrived and started blasting hip hop (a personal un-favorite), and I asked him to turn it down in just the speaker that was aimed at us so we could hear each other. It took us awhile to realize that nobody was inside even though we had a clear view of the patio, but we finally did and we headed out.   The patio was quieter and it overlooked Mill Ave in all its glory. We could see from the treetops to the pedestrians across the street. The patio quickly filled up while the inside remained more or less empty. They were gracious enough to include an outside bar so we didn't have to endure hip hop music on 11. There were also beds outside and some decent bar-height seating near the balcony which made it pretty casual and relaxing and social.   My biggest problem with the outside was that everyone was smoking (as young people all apparently do) and it felt just as smoky as the insides of smoky bars used to be before the smoking ban. I also kinda felt kinda cheated by having to pay 2 bucks for a diet soda refill (no refills, son). The staff was pretty nice and the waitresses seemed to be very attentive and efficient (and cute).   It's not really my kind of place because of the music and the crowd and the fact that those days are behind me, but I imagine that it has to be the best thing on that corner. If you're in your 20s, it seems like a great place to go.

OMG, I love this place. It's very close to my house, and it's been there all along - I am writing this as a reminder to myself to go here more often. The owners are the sweetest people ever. Best iced coffee within a mile of my house.   My girlfriend used to pick up breakfast for us from here on weekends, but then Pesto Prima opened up and we started doing that. Well, we are going to have to start alternating. The food here is fantastic.   I feel kinda guilty for not going here much over the last year, but I'm definitely glad I rediscovered this place. I mean, if you want to roll up to Breakfast Club in the clothes you slept in and wait in line for average eggs and bacon and sub-par coffee so you can be "seen" out to brunch - that's what you're going to do - if you want awesome food and coffee in a sweet little cafe, then come here.  The owner said they might start delivering soon - if that happens, holy cow. *crosses fingers*

I'm going to keep this short and sweet... I don't like Thai food that much. Not a huge fan anyway. I am giving it 4 stars because that's what it already has. The spring rolls are excellent - very fresh and crispy. A little more flavor would be my only complaint if you twisted my arm to come up with something to complain about.  The summer rolls are good as well. I had some pad thai, but the peanut smell prevented me from enjoying it. It's probably good if you like that sort if thing. I couldn't tell you. I will try it again - it's really close. Next time, I'll have a look at a menu and actually pick something out.

This is a fantastic location. I was scratching my head when the Food Bar closed wondering why. Now after eating at the Metro Brasserie, I'm wondering if the location is cursed. Perhaps it was built on top of an old graveyard. It would be interesting to go back in time 600 years or so to see if every trading post put up there failed as well.  So what's a failure here? Well, it's the food. The burgers were shit. Burned and dry. The bun was the same. The fries weren't so terrible, but everything else was. My friend asked for a replacement burger and I was discouraged enough to simply ask to try their mac and cheese. My friend's burger this time was burned on the outside and raw on the inside. Raw. I mean, it was still cold. The mac and cheese was bland, dry, and awful. Did not finish anything except the fries.   The service was good in the way that they were very nice and polite and they really wanted us to be happy. I can't say they got everything right, but they definitely tried. +1 for that... A for effort.   I thought the whole thing was overpriced, but they could've charged 10 bucks for that food we had and it would've been too much. In fact, I don't think they did charge us for the burgers... we just overtipped. I just mean the prices on the menu are a bit high. The location is beautiful though, so hopefully they'll get their shit together.

Spirit Halloween is a seasonal chain that has been growing every year. They occupy retail space around the country for only a few months out of the year, and leave an empty store for the rest of the year once Halloween is over. When it comes around, it's a real treat. It reminds me of Spencer's (back when they stocked more Halloween crap) but on a much much much larger scale.  They carry pretty much anything you could want for Halloween. Whether you're throwing a party or going to one - this is the place to go. You could decorate your entire house here and charge neighborhood kids admission... They have everything from detached eyeballs and styrofoam skulls to elaborate set pieces and animatronic corpses to light machines fog machines and noise makers. It's fun just walking in here to browse.  As for costumes - they have the largest variety I've seen at a wide variety of prices. If you're a girl, costume choices are usually all variations on the same theme... Witch Slut, Pirate Slut, Princess Slut, Angel Slut, Superhero Slut, Alice in Wonderland Slut, Schoolgirl Slut and Slutty Cop etc...   It's the same story here - you'll find pretty much every costume you can think of here that you'll find at a lingerie store or online... they also have a good assortment of funny costumes and couple's costumes. Ladies, it's also a fantastic place to buy slutty stripper shoes and boots. I love that about Halloween - girls dress in whatever costume makes them look like the biggest whore and guys dress in whatever makes them look like the biggest idiot - the next day, there are no repercussions. It's beautiful.  For guys, they have a good variety as well. They carry all the latest relevant stuff - recent movie characters, political figures, etc... They carry old standards as well. It's just the perfect place to shop.  Most places don't carry costumes for adults - this is where you want to go if you're looking to buy a costume - even if you're going to make one. They carry all the accessories you could want as well - makeup, blood, and gloop. It's a one-stop-shop. They also carry a very wide assortment of kid's costumes if you're tired of the crap they sell at Target and grocery store chains.   It's best to shop here early as it's not the kind of place that's going to keep replacing stock... they have what they have for the most part and when it's gone, I wouldn't count on waiting for it to come back in stock... just pick something else and move on. However, while they are open, they do keep the place pretty well stocked since it's only open for such a short time... they have to do it right.  After Halloween is over, this place goes into clearance mode. This is when I like to go. How can you dismiss huge discounts on skanky costumes for roleplay sex? You have to hurry though, because they don't stay open for long after Halloween is over, and once they decide to close you have to wait until next year or else order crap online. At the very least, you could get something good for next year.  Pricewise, Spirit is fair. I mean, it's pretty much retail pricing. You can't beat this place in terms of variety and convenience. My only complaints are that it's not open all year round and that the location they have has a window wall that gets a lot of sunlight in the afternoon and it makes it difficult to see sometimes.

I went again last night and it appears as though they have fixed the window problem and they've added an area to try on certain costumes. I also wanted to add that they even have costumes for your pets. This place pretty much has it all covered.   Since it's getting really close to Halloween, the place is packed and checkout may take awhile. I also noticed that a few costumes weren't in stock anymore - but they still have a huge selection. They already started discounting a few items as well.

I've never had any desire to be here. I actually had no idea it was a place to be. I didn't even know where it was to be honest... I had just heard about it... just that it existed by name. Nothing more. Had I seen the reviews here before going, I might not have even bothered.   A friend of mine was working the whole Fashion Week thing and somehow scored us these amazing $400 all-access VIP Super Passes to the whole thing including the after party held at the W.   The downtown area was a traffic congestion nightmare so it took awhile to get a place to park. They were holding a red velvet rope line show at the main entrance to the hotel where all the cars pull up. So elegant and fancy. We waited outside amidst the fumes and fancy rides for our turn to enter with our super passes for what seemed like forever.   Alas, it was not meant to be as the guy at the door (read: giant useless turd in a suit) finally told my lady friend that he can only let girls in that don't have guys with them... and apparently only if they pass a certain age, boob job, slutty dress set of standards that only exist in this guy's head. Some guys were getting in, but only models from the show pretty much.   I tried to convince my friend to just leave so we could go someplace I actually like, but she was wanting to prove a point on principal. She confronted him a few times about his being a soulless anus, but he didn't wouldn't change his position about us.   I should've stepped in and said "look - we've been standing here long enough - either let us the hell in or tell us we aren't welcome here even with our $400 all-access VIP super passes so we can fuck off to someplace better where we don't have to look at your shitty face, you hack."   In the end our time was wasted. Elitism won and we finally gave up since there was only an hour left of the night and the line had dwindled to only a few dozen people unfit to enter the exclusive party. My friend was too upset to salvage the energy to go to another place. She actually was over the whole Scottsdale thing and insisted that this was representative of the whole city - I was unable to assure her it wasn't (but I assure you it isn't). We hugged a sad goodnight right there in the W carport and went our separate ways.   It's easy to say I didn't really want to be in there in the first place - well, I really didn't. I was just interested in having a drink with a friend and catching up. The W just wasn't meant to be the venue to host such an event.   I never got to see the inside from the inside, but I'm pretty sure it smelled like shit covered in puke in there and was likely covered in some sort of sticky film that only drips off of the most hoity of toity. It's not that I'm jealous because I was already hanging out with all these same fake assholes at Fashion Week an hour earlier - I don't know that a change of scenery would really make them that much more compelling and interesting. In fact, I'm sure it wouldn't. It's just that I don't like places that judge you worthy or unworthy of coming in. It's demoralizing and insulting. Even if they had let us in, I would've felt the same way.   Pretentiousness is next to ugliness.   If I had actually paid $400 for that VIP Super Pass and not been let in to the party immediately, I'd be pretty livid. Since it was free, I can't be that mad - but the rope guy didn't know I got the passes for free. We were dressed nice and we're all fairly attractive people. Maybe I'm too old or too fat or didn't have on an Ed Hardly or Affraction shirt. Maybe this dude just didn't like the cut of my jib. No telling why for sure, but I certainly wouldn't have waited more than 5 minutes if it wasn't for my friend wanting to get in. It's just not something I do.   So I didn't get to see the inside of this place from the inside - just the car port with the parade of Escalades, sports cars and exhaust fumes. I'm sure it's pretty nice in there, but the only thing I'm willing to wait in line for that long is Space Mountain at Disneyland. I'm pretty sure there's nothing nearly as great inside this shallow pit of pseudo cool as fucking Space Mountain.   Blow me, W... you $#&@

Style over substance.  The Aria is nice... gorgeous building. Fantastic view. High tech amenities. Beautiful and classy rooms.  So why the 2 star review? Well... it's a 4 star building with 3 star treatment, a 2 star buffet and a 1 star nightclub.   The room was gorgeous - though I think that after the first night, they "cleaned" our room but hung our dirty towels on the towel bars and didn't give us replacements. So I'm sharing a room in Vegas with my buddy and we have to play "who's balls touched this" on the second night at an upscale hotel?! Can't tell you how rad it is to dry off after a shower with a damp dirty towel that may or may not have been used by your friend and his balls and butt.   The snack cabinet charges your room even if you so much as touch something or open the door.   The bed was retarded comfortable, but I think this place had bedbugs or something because I was eaten alive.  Being a guest of the hotel gets you a healthy "go fuck yourself" attitude from the bouncers at Haze.   Every time we tried to talk to someone who worked there to get some sort of service, we were met with anything but 4 or 5 star treatment. I'm easy to please, and I managed to have a good time here in spite of their best efforts to make me miserable. It was bizarre.  Their poker room was lively, but the chips were disgusting. They were so filthy and broken I didn't want to touch them. How much could a new set of chips cost? This is pretty common though.   The worst buffet I've been to in Vegas.   This is a beautiful hotel and I would consider staying here again if I didn't have to pay for it. Their casino is a drag and I'm not impressed by the food. Their nightclub is reason enough to avoid this entire hotel.

With the closure of one of my favorite nearby sub joints - Port of Subs on Scottsdale - I find myself pleasantly surprised to find another great sub joint pop up nearby. This one perhaps even better than my old favorite.  See, I don't like to eat at sub joints that get their meats shipped in boxes pre-sliced who knows when. Port of Subs was one of the few that cut the meat when you ordered. I'll miss that, but Silver Mine is close. They slice the meat fresh all day as part of the shifts. That means it's still very fresh. The quality of their meats and bread is great as well. Their bread is especially good.   The restaurant is clean - immaculate even. The employees are all really nice dudes. So friendly, I doubt they're even from here. They must be from the Midwest.   This place would probably deserve four stars like any other good sub joint should, but what sets this place apart is that they deliver until 3am. That's right - not only does this place deliver sandwiches, they're open until 3 mother-frenchin a-to the-m.   Their brownies are 430 calories and they worth - they worth hard. They carry a great selection of chips and bev, and since they are relatively new on the scene - they seem to be constantly tweaking the business here and there. Their menus get revised every time I order from them. They give away scratch cards that usually give you a free delivery or a free small side item or drink or something. I have yet to win a car or my own franchise, but they popped up all over town at some point recently.   If I did win my own sub shop, I'd change the tag line to "You can't beat our meat" because that's what the people would want.  Seriously, these guys are cool and the food is good.

Please eat here.   Just do it.   It's amazing.   It's delicious.   It's sex in your mouth... All the sex.   If you're a food nerd that likes food porn and taking sexy instagram pictures of your food - go here and order something. Then try not to shove it in your face hole before you remember to whip out your phone and snap a picture.   Then you can tweet your half-eaten burrito photo to your friends who won't understand why it's so good because they're looking at your teeth marks in a half-eaten burrito.   The owner's mom is the cook I think - sweetest lady ever. Whoever is cooking is a genius - an artist. I'm going to go back a hundred times. One of the best burritos I've ever had.   It's next to a Hungry Howie's in an invisible old tiny strip mall. It belongs somewhere posh and fancy going by the quality of the food. I'm glad it's not somewhere posh and fancy. I don't like getting burrito and guacamole and salsa all over my nice shirts...

Holy shit... this place has been right down the street from me for nearly a year and I am just now discovering it?!? El Coquito is a hidden little gem. One of the very few Puerto Rican joints in the Valley. It's a real authentic hole-in-the-wall too. You could drive past it 100 times and not know it was there or that it was good. Don't be scared - just go inside.   It's cozy inside - like you're stepping into someone's house (though unlike some tiny restaurants in Central Phoenix, this one isn't a converted house). Quaint and eclectic decor that's thoughtfully placed and somehow cohesive gives the feeling of being transported to another country. The contents certainly don't match the cover. I love that this place is so close to me, but it's a bit of an unfortunate location.  The owner is super nice and friendly - which is really refreshing in this town. I can't blame them for the most part given the state of the economy, but being a personable and accommodating restaurant owner goes a really long way toward earning and keeping business. People come to little independent restaurants to be fed - treat them like family or a welcome guest and cook for them with love and they'll come back - a lot. That's what I plan to do.  I'm not terribly familiar with Puerto Rican food, but El Coquito made me a lifetime fan. Some of the most flavorful dishes I've ever had. I don't know how authentic it is, but I'm going to go ahead and assume it is very much. I know that this place gets filled with famous Puerto Rican baseball players quite a bit when Spring training hits.   One thing I really like is that the dishes aren't copious amounts of food... Americans are overfed and we overeat. The portions here are just right. On a diet? I can't promise it's all the most healthy as some of it is deep fried and the most flavorful steaks are going to have plenty of marbling and fat on them - however, a reasonably sized meal is what you will get. You'll be full and you'll eat every bite, but you won't feel like a huge gluttonous fat.   They are equipped to deliver, but the hours vary a bit. Never hurts to ask if you call. Dine in or carry out if you must - just eat.  I highly recommend this place.

Their food is fantastic and their prices are low. It's a tiny place and the owners/staff are great. I work nearby and haven't taken full advantage - I just discovered it shortly after deciding to diet. Their breakfast burritos are amazing and cheap. Their delicious pastries make the place smell like a real bakery. It's been a really long time since I've been to a decent bakery in Phoenix. I may write more later, but that's all I've got right now... so tough beans. Go eat there.

Clever name, but that's where it ends. I live very close to this place, so I figured it would be worth checking out. I love good Korean food, but when it's not done well, it sucks. This place is merely serviceable. Our leftovers were very stinky and the food wasn't good. The decor inside was unimpressive, but felt authentic for a hole-in-the-wall. The food isn't horrible, but I can't recommend it.  Papago Plaza has a few gems, but sadly not everything there is awesome.

Ate a meatball sub here the other day, and enjoyed it a lot. It was enormous, so I had some to take home and my girlfriend gobbled up the innards (since she's doing some lo-carb no bread thing). She loved it. I mean, for the price, it's a ton of food... and the food is good.   This place has been here for years now, and it's family run. I am a little picky about where I eat - if a place isn't clean or smells funny or whatever, I'll turn around and leave. But this place is clean and you can see the kitchen when you walk in. I live just outside their delivery area I think or I would order from them regularly.   The food is better than some big mega chain, and the prices are better too. The decor is a little divey and it's not going to win any style awards for decoration (though I do think their logo is pretty cool), but for a low-cost delivery or takeout pizza or sandwich, it's a great alternative to a Domino Hut sort of thing.   I always eat local when I can. This place earns the seal of approval from me.

Please kill whoever staffed this place.   I've lived in Scottsdale, so I'm no stranger to the scrutinizing of kicks by chubby short dudes in cheap suits. However, that doesn't mean I'm not tired of it.   My shoes were fine to get into the club actually - I was wearing worn out Monkey Boots from 1990. I was handsome and dressed pretty sharp and stylish. My presence could only improve the ambiance of this joint. One of the guys I was with had some nice plain white leather tennis shoes on that probably cost 3x as much as mine did when I bought them. He was denied entry. This means we were all denied entry.  Also, the fact that they allow people in who wear bedazzled t-shirts and who have never heard of toothpaste or deodorant makes my head spin.   The main problem I had with this place was with the bouncers who wouldn't let us in to look around... We were guests of the hotel and we couldn't get in. The first time we tried, one of us had the wrong shoes on... we went on with our night and had a good time and spent our money elsewhere.   Later that evening, two of us wearing the right type of shoe tried to get in... it was the end of their night and there was no line and people were filing out, but things were still going on and they were still letting people in. We wandered up to the rope/fence that had no obvious entry point and got ignored. Nobody was manning the station either. It was just a few poorly dressed bouncers standing around a podium chatting and ignoring us.  My friend waved at them and then stepped over a spot where the rope was touching the ground to go talk to them and ask if we could get in to check the place out. We even identified ourselves as hotel guests and flashed our keys. At that point, one of the bouncers got all serious about his job/status and threatened to get physically violent with the both of us if we didn't leave the area.   Seriously? That's how you treat guests of the hotel? We left without an eyeful of nightclub - we left with only an interesting topic of conversation for our elevator ride up to the room.   In the morning, after checkout, we wandered up to the front of the nightclub and asked a nice woman if we could take a peek inside. She gave us a quickie 2 minute tour of the first floor - the club looked like a weathered old cargo ship. Shit was held together with duct tape. To be fair, they were reupholstering parts of it - and to their credit, the layout of the place seemed somewhat interesting.  On an off-night, I'm sure a good time could be had here - in spite of the staff trying their best to thwart such a thing. I won't be visiting this club on any of my future visits, and I will be sure to let everyone know to avoid it. For a good time, head to the Chandelier bar just down the street.

I'm going to keep this short and sweet...  Ate here a few weeks back. The food was fantastic. It was the best Mediterranean food I've had in the West Valley for sure. This is a nice family owned mom and pop, so if you're into supporting local places - come here. Or get delivery - they deliver now. The owner was really cool and accommodating - made me feel like I was eating at my own family's house (except better because no one tried to stab me with a fork).   I'm definitely going to go out of my way to eat here again.

Stopped in today for lunch. There's a reason this place is famous. Really fantastic sandwich. I had the same sandwich that won best sandwich on that Man vs Food show - absolutely delicious.   The owners are awesome family franchisees who were friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was gorgeous and immaculate as well. For a fast-casual restaurant, this place seemed pretty upscale and professional. The truth is, this is a very small chain based out of Chicago with only a few locations outside of IL... and only one in Arizona so far.   You can't go into this thinking "Cheesesteak" (not that you would)... it's a really flavorful italian beef. You also have to expect that the bread is going to get a little soggy from the meat juices. The bread they use is great and even though I let my sandwich sit for a bit, it didn't get too soggy at all. Just soaked up the flavors a bit - only the last bit of bread at the end was a little wet.   The fries were hand cut (the owner was proud of this - as he should be), and delicious. Know that you can order your fries however you like them - regular, crispy, no salt or extra salty.   I hope they open more locations - this one delivers around the area, so that's rad. Makes me wish I lived closer. I'm definitely going back to try a dog - haven't had one in awhile. I just got back from a trip to Chicago too, so it will be fun to compare. So far, it's spot-on. The closest thing to this I can think of is Luke's which is different. Both are good.  I really don't understand some of the negative reviews here... this place is immaculate, everyone is nice, and the food is awesome. Italian beef might not be for everyone, but there's something for everyone here.

I'm going to preface this by saying that I'm teetering on giving a 3 or a 4. I'm going with 4 because they worked so hard. 3 is "A-OK," so it wouldn't necessarily be a negative review, but I know how important their yelp feedback is and I don't want to do that to them over minor-ish issues when the rest of the day went well.   I bought a house coming from a rental, and my girlfriend and I were both working our butts off getting everything packed in boxes for the big day. I'm not going to lie - I have a lot of shit. We filled their truck floor to ceiling with stuff. It took all day with 3 guys to get all of it wrapped, in the truck, over to the new place, and sorted in rooms. Packing took days and days with procrastination days in between. We never quite finished as much as we should have - even pulling an all-nighter the night before, we were still packing boxes as they moved furniture into the truck.  The guys were professional and really nice and talkative and friendly. They came prepared with loads of stretch wrap (they'll call it shrink wrap) and the most blankets I've ever seen. We had the cats holed up in the bathrooms with their own litter, bed, water and food... didn't want to put them in together in case they got to fighting.   After the guys arrived, we walked through the rooms and set up our game plan. I showed them which items were more fragile and what to be careful of. I showed them everything that needed to be moved as well. They told us we were in good hands and that they would take care of everything.  One of em did seem annoyed that we couldn't let them use the bathroom because the cats would flee (even though there was a nice quiet and private area around the side of the house to pee) - we did feel a bit bad about that one. Though we were paying for their time and offered to drive them down the street if they wanted. We also provided them with electrolyte infused bevs, and I gave one of the guys an older big screen HD projection TV that I didn't have space for at the new house.   We kept boxing and cleaning as they went along... eventually, I got too exhausted and needed a nap, so when they were about 70% done, I went over to the other house to prep for their arrival and lay down for a few minutes. Molly stayed behind and wrapped up at the other place.  When they arrived at the new place, we did a walkthrough and gave them an idea of where everything needed to go... They go to it. It took a bit longer than we expected, but everything was off the truck and in the house in roughly the areas we wanted them. After settling up the bill, we went back to the other place and grabbed the cats and brought them home.  Now during the move, a few items were damaged. Most of it was toward the end of the day. I was only made aware of one of the items during the move - a big chunk of wood broke off a Copenhagen dresser I've had for decades. I said it was no big deal (it sort of was I guess, but I didn't want to act like it because it's just stuff), but he offered to knock 10% off the bill. In retrospect, that didn't really amount to as much as it sounded.  It's been a few weeks, and I've been noticing things here and there. A speaker grill dented and wood chipped off. Lots of scratches on things that weren't there before. The inside of the fridge was quite scratched up on the door because they had trouble fitting it through the doorway. They scratched the hell out of the wall as well in the kitchen and said "just needs a little touch up paint." I mean, it was late in the day, so I totally get it. If I had made a big deal out of it, they probably would have painted it for me or something, but I just said "don't worry about it."   Ikea furniture almost didn't make it because it's not built for durability, plus I left items in the drawers (which is usually okay with movers) - the problem was (with a lot of things) they didn't really seem to bother keeping things upright - they just wrapped everything in blankets and stretch wrap and flipped it around any old way. Contents inside many things were shifted more than expected. Again - a few minor damages... nothing major (that I've found yet). They also put tape on some original old collectable boxes that made them less collectable in order to keep them shut.   They really made no promises that my items would arrive completely unscathed. I'm sure we signed a waiver or something. And it's stuff - it's always risky to move a ton of stuff.   Another minor gripe was that some of the items I needed moved were left behind at the other house. These were items I had shown them during the initial walk-through, but Molly said that there wasn't much room left on the truck, and that she didn't know I wanted to take it. I mean, yeah - we had to take everything out of the rental. sooo.... Either way, we had to get a friend to loan us his truck.   Would I use them again? Eh... maybe, maybe not. Recommend? I guess. *shrug*

Matta's is BACK!  I'm pleased to announce that it's all very familiar. This tradition goes back to 1953. For me, it's been 20 years as a loyal patron. When the original building closed, I found out on my birthday (a personal tradition to eat here on my birthday) - I actually cried.   They were supposed to open the new location a year later, but it has been 3. Well, it was worth the wait.   The new building is gorgeous and huge. The food still tastes awesome. The margaritas are the same. The Salsa is the same. Even some of the staff is the same.  It was a long wait, but it was well worth it.   The new Matta's is located in the Mesa Riverview Mall that popped up out of nowhere and was overshadowed by Tempe Marketplace just a few blocks away.   They apparently had a soft opening last night and a large opening tonight. In spite of being a huge place, it was packed. Total chaos. We didn't quite get every item we ordered and a few items were different from what we ordered, but who would expect an opening night with a packed house to go perfectly smooth. And anyway, any mistakes were smoothed over and made up for.   Matta's is back and I'm going to be spending a lot of time here.   I still think this is the best Mexican food restaurant in the Valley. I love you, Matta's.   I will update this review after a few more visits. So far, so good.

Great concept and solid execution. I sampled the goods and it was all... good. Tasty treats with alcohol inside. The girl behind the counter was friendly and hospitable. The classic minimalist parlor decor was a nice touch.  Looking through the glass at the tubs of ice cream wasn't that much of a draw. It just didn't have much curb appeal or showcase very well. Thankfully, it tasted better than it looked. I didn't get drunk off my one scoop, but she didn't promise that I would. Also, I was already kinda buzzed when I went in there. I couldn't really taste the alcohol to be honest.  I really like that this place is here - I mean, everywhere you look there's some sort of gelato or yogurt shoppe around the corner. Having something different is a reason to make a special trip whereas stumbling upon yet another generic gelato shop may give you the urge to buy a scoop. That's going to have to be what saves this place. I can't imagine there being much of a profit margin in ice cream, and I'm sure the rent ain't cheap.   This is worth the trip. I wasn't blown away, but I enjoyed the experience and I also like to support local small businesses. Also, I'm a supporter of putting alcohol in anything I might put in my body.   Kudos.

I walked in here to buy a soda and came out with a variety of pretzel sticks dipped in various sweet confections and a trio of cupcakes.   The store is beautiful. It's in a pretty ritzy little PV/Scottsdale shopping center, so one would expect that.   I had fun talking to the sassy girl behind the counter - we quipped back and forth, and she questioned me about the photos I was taking with my cell phone suspicious about where they would end up. I sent one to my girlfriend (she has the word "CUPCAKE" tattooed on the inside of her bottom lip) to which she replied: "YOU"RE KILLING ME!" It may or may not have had a part in her decision to go to Bikram yoga tonight.   I asked why they weren't at the Cupcake Love-in, and she said it was because they were busy... now that I've tasted the cupcakes, I'd guess it was probably because they didn't want to embarrass all the other bakeries. I mean, wow. All three were beautifully crafted, and in the display case they all looked very uniform - like it didn't matter which Salted Caramel one you got, they would all be the same.  I had Banana Nutella - holy crap, so amazing. The flavors were distinct, but not overpowering. It wasn't overly sweet either. The cake was moist and fluffy (but substantial), and the frosting was creamy and soft. There was no sour or sugary aftertaste.  I also had their Double Chocolate... It was very moist and very chocolate forward. It was a bold flavor. Again, it wasn't overly sweet and the consistency of the cake and frosting was the same. If you're a chocolate lover, this is serious business.  Finally got my girlfriend's favorite - Red Velvet. I'm normally not a huge fan because the frosting on these often tastes "off" to me. This is hands-down the best Red Velvet I've ever tasted. The frosting was again not too sweet and the flavor only hinted just enough at cream-cheese. The cake was delicious as well. Again, no aftertaste - and after sampling all 3, I didn't feel sick to my stomach with sugar overload.   The pretzel sticks dipped in various sweets were amazing. This place being across the street from the Railroad park, I can see taking a date here and picking a couple of these up and going for a walk in the park. If I'm ever tasked with getting cupcakes for someone, I'm probably coming here.

100% of the money goes to charity for this thing. I've gone twice now, but I bought my gf a ticket for the first one since she's a cupcake fan.   I will keep going and supporting this event. If you like cupcakes, you should attend next year.   I had one little mishap this year when someone told me a cupcake was vanilla and I had to find out the hard way (after it was in my esophagus) that it had coconut in it. I'm allergic, see... I was fine after some benadryl the Valley Ho staff had on hand, but it kinda sucked. If you're allergic to things, be sure to ask if what you are about to eat contains those things.  Many vendors ran out of cupcakes this year, but part of that had to do with people taking more than they intended to eat early on. They'll sort it out for next year for sure. Mind Over Batter was my favorite this year. Newcomers Butter and Me and Bre's Petites were also standouts.   Raffles, cupcakes, eating contests, photo booth, free milk, custom t-shirts, panel of judges, yelp swag, VIP bags, face painting, and of course booze. How can you go wrong? What's a little diabetes when it's for a good cause?

It's no secret that I'm a fan of Cheesesteaks and Pizza. In spite of the fact this place seems like it is some big national chain, it's actually a small local thing with only a handful of locations and a few different owners. It's definitely worth a look.   I had lunch here today, and it's now 5pm and I'm still feeling good about it. I ate a cheeseteak this time - a full - it's a lot of food. The sandwich was stuffed with a copious amount of flavorful strip steak and traditional cheese whiz. The bread was a fresh and chewy roll that was almost like a bagel texture and flavor. It was sturdy enough that it didn't get soggy or fall apart as I took my time devouring the thing.   Most cheesesteaks in the Valley are at least pretty similar if the restaurants source their food from the same distributor (which most do) - and even though it's a fairly simple sandwhich, it's easy to mess up or get wrong. I'm happy to report that the cheesesteak here is reliably delicious, and apart from some of the local places that do cheesesteaks vastly different from the norm (for better or worse), this one is among the top choices.   Next time, I'm definitely going to have to try their pizzas.   The owner here is really nice, and we chatted for a bit about this and that... if I find myself in this part of town again, I'll definitely come back. They apparently have a pretty huge delivery area too if you live nearby. I mean, you can get burgers, hot dogs, subs, wings, pizza, salads, and cheesesteaks delivered? If you suck at cooking, you can have something different delivered every night of the week. What more could you ask for?

Filmbar is fantastic conceptually. I've been wanting to actually open one up since I was in high school. As far as I got was to host movie nights at my house or apartment and invite groups of people. I even ran one biweekly  for yelpers and friends a few years back and showed indie and foreign movies.   So the discovery of filmbar truly piqued my interest. Upon arrival, we were both impressed and confused. We didn't know what we were supposed to do at first and it was a little awkward. If it wasn't for the owner coming out to talk to us, we would've felt uncomfortable the entire time we were there - like uninvited guests at someone's private hipster house party.  This isn't just a bar... it's a bar that has a movie theater in it. It would've made a huge difference to have someone who works there to welcome people in and tell them "how it works" or something. Make that happen, filmbar.   The decor is classy and refined. The layout is intimate. If you're with a group of people, be prepared to split up into smaller clusters. The atmosphere is dark and cozy. The theater itself is a decent size - larger than home theater and smaller than a screening room. It appears as though they just have some speakers up and a screen and a projector hooked up to a DVD player.   The seats are somewhat comfy, but put together cheaply... In a few months, I predict they will start looking kinda beat up... in a year, they will need to be replaced. My biggest gripe is that the acoustics and layout of the theater make it too easy to hear drunk people talking to each other over your shoulder. Also - no cup holders for your wine glasses. Disaster is looming nightly.   We saw Spike and Mike's Twisted Animation... number 50? I saw the very first one that played here in Tempe ages ago. Didn't the internet and youtube render this pointless? The sound quality was awful for the film, so it's difficult to judge whether or not the sound in the theater would be good if they played a good film. The video was awful too - film/art school projects - tough to tell given the film shown.   We're definitely planning on showing up again for movies and booze. I'd like to see some more options for beverages and nibbles. I'd like to see a greeter or ticket booth or a little more organization. I'd like to see "I Saw the Devil."

I don't get out to the far West side very often. In fact, it had been so long that I didn't even know all that Westgate stuff was even there. Imagine my surprise! I have been to a few games at the stadium, but all of the shopping and restaurants were new to me. It's absolutely beautiful here.   It was also nearly deserted when I went today - no games going on. There's not much else out here. Just this giant oasis of awesome in the middle of a corn field.   I've glazed over the other reviews here and I almost didn't get it at first. I mean, such polarized opinions about a pizza place. Walking around Westgate and seeing Mama Gina's, I get it now. Mama Gina's is a nice medium sized restaurant/bar. It's really clean and decorated well. The seating is comfortable and everything is new. Also - it smells like pizza - as a pizza place should.  There's a lovely patio with a giant glass door that I imagine can be opened when weather permits to have an indoor/outdoor atmosphere. There are big flatscreens playing whatever sports is on. They appear to have a full bar as well.   I ate a slice and took a pie home. Their pizza is pretty unique. It's very flavorful and good. I could tell that their dough was made fresh daily - it was soft and airy. They clearly use quality ingredients. It's a huge cut above a cheapie chain. While waiting, I saw some other food pass by on the way to their respective tables... everything looked pretty amazing and delicious.   A group was leaving before me and an older man said "thanks" to the manager. Then he added that he hadn't had pizza like that since he was a kid and that it was the best pizza he had eaten in years. It was a sincere compliment.  A slice and a soda set me back less than 5 bucks, and the slice was huge enough to fill me up. The pie I took home was as good as the slice I had. This is the kind of pizza you re-heat in the oven rather than the microwave.   Now the problems - well, there's really only one and all other perceived problems stem from it... it's the location. Because it's next to the stadium and little else, it's either going to be super busy or relatively empty. Because of this, service isn't going to be as consistent - you're just going to have to develop a little patience. Also - most customers coming to this sort of place when busy are the "I'm drunk and happy my team won" or "I'm drunk and pissed my team lost" types - neither of which are a treat to serve when most of the time you're used to things being fairly calm.   I recommend eating here when there's not a game (or even when there is - just be patient - same with all the restaurants in Westgate) - the food is worth a bit of a drive, and Westgate is a beautiful commerce center.

Haven Burgers is very clean. Burgers are REALLY good. Service is friendly and fast. Prices are low. This place is family owned and you can tell they are passionate about and proud of their food.   I'm probably going to have to come back to try other things on the menu. They also have breakfast including breakfast burritos, French toast, and cook to order omelets. They also have Mexican style burritos and quesadillas, and a variety of salads. The burger was excellent though, so as I sit here in the booth digesting and writing this, I'm already thinking about the next one I'm gonna order when I return.

I'm giving this place a 5 because it's one of the best burgers I've had in Phoenix. The real score is somewhere between a 4 and a 5 though.   I truly dig the burger. They clearly use quality meats - in fact, they advertise this. The fries here are fantastic as well. We grabbed this to-go, and the fries were still crispy and perfect. They don't have beer quite yet I don't think, but they will in a few weeks. They do have a really cool assortment of soda bottles though.  I like the concept and the execution. I'm glad this is near my house. The owner and the staff are cool, and I hope this restaurant succeeds.

This location has been many different restaurants over the years - this is a tough spot. This is my favorite thing it's been though.   The food is great here and the owner is cool. The prices are really reasonable and the portions are large. The place is really clean and the decor is nice. Everything is cooked in plain sight, so there's no mystery.   My only complaint would be that he doesn't deliver yet. We definitely need a good gyro place that delivers in the area.  Seriously though - the food is really delicious. If you like flavors - it's all really flavorful. Great hummus too. Try the pizza puff.

Wandered in the other day after leaving Echo Coffee... They haven't officially had their grand opening, but they were indeed open. Still in the process of getting menus printed and figuring it all out, but that doesn't mean they don't have the pizza down.   First off - I can't tell you how glad I am that this corner is getting good tenants. I worked across the street a million years ago when it was Scottsdale Video, and I used to frequent TT Roadhouse. The corner always seemed to have so much potential other than a spot to bottom out your car crossing the intersection. I'm just happy to see some nice stuff pop up. Hopefully it'll turn the ill parts of the neighborhood around.  Anyway, I only had a slice, but it was flavorful and delicious. I'm looking forward to having another. Pepperoni was spicy and the cheese and sauce were as well. It's a little on the greasy side, but that's what napkins are for.   I like the decor and the owner is a nice guy. It's a little small, but it's nice and new and clean - and it's in a new building. The more pizza options in the Valley, the better.

I'm going to keep this brief... Taste of Greek is fantastic.   The french fries are some of the best I've ever had. I'm not even a fan of thicker fries normally, but these were crazy good. Hot and crispy.   I had a gyro as well - the meat was cut right in front of me and was cut into really thin strips - almost like a Philly Cheesesteak. I'm a fan of this style. Their tzatziki sauce is delicious and fresh. The pita was also fresh and soft... the entire thing was the size of my head and while I managed to scarf it all down, I was too full to finish every french fry (but not for a lack of trying).   This place is really clean, and everything is cooked and prepared out in the open. It's fast-casual style, but they weren't super busy when I went and they were bringing food out to the tables which was nice. Most of the tables could only seat two people which makes this perfect for a quick lunch with a co-worker or by yourself. They have a few tables that seat more, but it's not a huge restaurant.  The staff is friendly and helpful. This is a family owned Valley business - they are apparently related to a few other places around town (not all the same name, but the ones I've eaten at were also very good).   The only thing this place is missing is delivery. If these restaurants would deliver, they would be unstoppable. Oh, and there needs to be one really close to my house.  I'm definitely going to be back.

I had no idea what this place was about until I walked in the door in the middle of the day the week they opened. I was greeted by a duo of incredibly pretty and young (college aged) women.   Similar to Tilted Kilt, Blondie's, and Hooters - this is a place where you have your food served by beautiful young women dressed in... not much. It's an experience to be had for sure. The girls here are all pretty amazing looking - they clearly have high standards in that department.   The food was decent - it was basically bar food. The sliders weren't mind blowing and neither was the Philly Cheesesteak. I did really enjoy the chips and cheese sauce though. Their fries are thick cut and heavily seasoned, but they weren't very crispy. I definitely want to try other items on the menu.  The place is huge and the decor is modern representation of rustic snow lodge cabin. It's new, so everything is nice and clean. There are small flatscreen televisions on the tables in the booths and large flatscreens all around the restaurant, so I imagine this would be a fun place to go out with the guys to watch the game and get away from the wives. The service was quick and the girls were all very nice and friendly. It's just that sort of place.  Nobody is going to dance on your table or lap if you hand them money... it's NOT that sort of place. However, if you just like to have this sort of view while you eat, you can't really go wrong. At least you will go home covered in grease and smelling like 1000 island dressing rather than covered in glitter and smelling like 1000 different perfumes.   I'd rather have better food if it means more clothes on the waitresses, but that's me. I'm going to have to go back and try something else once they work the kinks out (if there are any to get worked out), but I wasn't displeased with Twin Peaks at all. My score is between a 3 and a 4... it's solid if this is your sort of thing.

A brand new pizza concept hits the Valley... sandwiched between Sammy's Place and a Subway, this is a new "fast casual" pizza restaurant. It's not yet "famous" here in Phoenix, but they definitely aspire to be. The owner - Frank - clearly spent a lot of time and money on this place, and he seems to be passionate about the business. That's always a good sign.   The restaurant is sharp and clean and has a shiny new coat of paint. Though there used to be a different pizza joint in this spot at one point, you wouldn't know it. You can tell they use quality fresh ingredients and a lot of thought went into it.   I had a slice of pepperoni and a cannoli, and both were absolutely delicious. The crust on the pizza was light and crisp and flavorful... it ranks pretty high on my list for pizza crust I'd say. It was a tasty slice. You can't go wrong here.   They've only been open for 2 days so far, but they seemed to hit the ground running. They currently offer slices and whole pizzas to-go, and they eventually plan to add delivery and online ordering and the whole 9 yards... delivery hopefully soon. The prices here are low in spite of the atmosphere suggesting otherwise. The owner seems like a nice genuine guy whose goal is happy customers. I hope this place does well and that he opens one up near my house. I think he plans to make more of these... he should.

Holy hell, The Spot is amazing!  My girlfriend has been bugging me to come check this place out for months, so I finally came in on a rainy day... It's a cute little narrow corridor of a restaurant sandwiched in a strip mall next to a Fresh & Easy, but there's a patio outside and a cute upstairs loft area with comfy couches and chairs. It's  tastefully decorated and it just feels like a nice inviting place conducive to socializing and eating.  I ordered the soon-to-be-famous sliders. Wow. Probably the best sliders I've had in my life - or at least up there. They came with a generous amount of onion strings (sort of like a cross between a seasoned curly fry and a regular onion ring), and a copious side of baked Mac and cheese. It was all really delicious, and a huge amount of food.   They are really punching above their actual price range here... My ticket total was pretty cheap. Everyone here seems super friendly... I would expect a place like this in Austin, Portland, or someplace else hip and cool. I suppose in some ways Gilbert is becoming that. Growing up in the valley, I'm having trouble seeing it...  Anyway, I love this place. Worth the drive.

This place should have a line out the door.  Just stopped in for some breakfast... I will be back for lunch.   I just ate a breakfast sandwich that was more delicious than one I could have made myself, and it only cost a couple bucks. The prices here are insanely low. Breakfast for two including coffee was less than 10 bucks. It came out quick too. We were pressed for time, and our order was ready fast.   Next to Chaser's, this cafe is certainly a welcome addition to the neighborhood. You wouldn't really know it was here if you were driving by, but you would be hard-pressed to find a more convenient location as a customer. I'm really glad to have something like this so close. I spoke with the owner for a bit, and he is a neighborhood local and super nice. I'm hoping he starts offering delivery.   So I had a simple english muffin sandwich - it came with Canadian bacon, egg, cheese, and a cilantro pesto aioli that was amazing. It was made fresh with fresh ingredients and it was literally the most delicious breakfast sandwich of this ilk I've ever had. If you go to McDonalds and get one of their processed frozen chemical flavorless factory mcmuffins - you're going to pay more. That's a fact.   Same goes for Starbucks - I have paid more for one coffee at Starbucks than I did for 2 breakfast sandwiches and 2 coffees here. Also, Starbucks makes breakfast sandwiches too - nowhere near as good and so much more expensive.  This place is new, and it has a cool name but the sign is hard to see. It's also located in a strip mall that people know exists, but they tend to ignore. People will say this is a "hidden gem" - and I hope it doesn't stay that way. It deserves to be packed all the time. I want this place to succeed because it's close and inexpensive and most importantly - delicious. Truth is though, if I moved I would pass up 5 closer places just to come here.  I'm headed back for lunch in a few hours, so I'll probably add more to this review.

I used to go to a Pho place on the West side of town all the time with my father when he was still alive. Pho Bang. That place was a family business and remained my favorite Pho joint for years. I took dates there and it was one of my go-to little hidden spots to recommend and take friends to for years. Over time, they started going a bit down hill I think. The food didn't seem to change much, but after awhile it was apparent that they were in need of a fresh coat of paint or new chairs and tables or something.   Anyway, long story short - I eventually sorta stopped going there and I didn't really realize how much I missed having a good Pho place to hit up once in awhile. That brings me to Pho Cao. This is the building that used to be Crazy Fish 202 Sushi. I think it was even something before that I can't remember. The parking lot is awkward to get to, and if you miss the turn you may be inclined to just give up and go somewhere else rather than turn around and go back. Well, don't. This place is worth it.   It has only been open less than a week, but they've already made massive changes to the building and if you've been here before, you're in for a pleasant surprise as they've clearly put in a lot of work. There are still a few little kinks to be worked out as they are so new, but that's pretty standard at any new place. The owner and staff are super nice and enthusiastic. I love supporting local businesses when it's clear they love what they are doing - and that shows here.  Now the food... is it as good as my favorite Pho? Well, I would definitely have to put their rolls up there with the best of them. I ordered a second plate of Egg Rolls (which are called Spring rolls at the other place) after finishing the first if that tells you anything. They mixed up my order a bit for my entree and brought out something that was similar to what I ordered, but a totally different item. It was a simple mistake, but they were good about offering to correct it.  I opted to eat it anyway rather than send it back. I plan on trying a bunch of things there, and I'm not a stickler for such things. The waitress was attentive and quick to bring drink refills. My entree was good, and I tried my gf's Pho and thought that was mighty tasty as well. The tea she ordered was amazing - the little beads of boba reminded me of that Orbitz drink that was discontinued years ago. If you're feeling nostalgic, there you go...   I had a good time, and I'm looking forward to going back. They have great food. They are close to my house too which is a plus. They have a full bar and plan to do live music and other fun stuff. They also plan to start delivering soon I believe which is awesome. We need more delivery places in town. It's close to ASU and Old Town Scottsdale - such a great location.  By the way - I found out it's pronounced FUH and not foe. After all these years doing it wrong. I may just keep saying it wrong.

We were starving and wandering around Scottsdale Quarter, so we decided to pop into True Food to eat. In spite of there being lots of open tables, they said there would be an epic wait - or we could sit with some strangers or on a sofa outside. I didn't feel like doing either of those things, so we split and headed south. I used yelp to find the best place that was still open and on the way.   Il Bosco showed up with the best overall score, and neither of us had eaten here so we decided to give it a shot. It's tucked away in a little nook next to Handlebar J's and looked cute and inviting. We wandered in and were seated right away. It's a cozy little place - clearly decorated with care and love.  We both ordered water (sparkling and still) and they came in these fancy artisan bottles that were left at our table along with a pair of small glasses filled with ice. I like when restaurants do this. They also brought out a tiny strange plate with olives on it. Neither of us eat olives, so we sorta poked at them, puzzled over them and dared each other to eat one.   The menu was elegant and beautiful - simple and hand written. We later got an explanation from the owner that he had a local artist make them by hand. Details details... this place is rich in details. The items on the menu were pretty much just salads and pizzas.   Everything about this place says "fancy fine-dining" and if I hadn't looked at the prices I would've thought it was going to be too rich for my blood. As it turns out, the prices were VERY reasonable. The only thing I thought was a little pricey was the water - on any other night I would've ordered wine though, and the wine prices were appropriate.   We ordered a pizza (half and half - something you can do as long as the sauces match) and a caesar salad. They brought some artisan bread with herb oil for us to snack on, and we made that disappear. The salad was split into two plates and we quickly ate that up as well - it wasn't drowning in dressing. It was an excellent presentation and a good salad.   The pizza then arrived... it was about a 10-12" woodfired pizza. My half was pepperoni and sausage. Her half was just cheese. Each half had a name on the menu - girls names if I remember correctly. We each took a piece over to our plates and started digging in. Right off the bat, I noticed how rich and creamy the cheese was. The pepperoni was light and had a perfect amount of spice behind it. The sauce was flavorful. The most notable part was the crust though - light, crisp, airy, and delicate.   We both cleaned our plates - the only things we left behind were the olives. We also ordered a dessert - creme brule - it was one of the best I've ever had. We were both full, but we didn't feel like we needed to be wheeled out to the car in a cart. It was the perfect amount of food. It was also pretty inexpensive for what you get. This is high quality fine dining with great atmosphere and attentive staff. This is a new date-night spot for me. It's also inexpensive enough to make it a regular spot.  Had a chat with the owner who was waiting on us most of the night, and he seems like a great guy. We could tell that he loved his business. I like supporting local businesses, and this 5 star review is one of the most deserved that I've ever given.

I'll go ahead and add my 5 stars and spare you the 2 cents - other than to say the food here is fantastic, the place is clean, the staff is nice, the decor is cool, the location is awesome, and they had jawbreakers in the candy basket on the way out.   Definitely go here and eat.

Legit.  The menu is very very simple, but the food is outstanding. The location - not so much... However, I would definitely come back here if I was in the downtown area.   Molly and I sampled everything they offered on the menu (there's like 3 things, and they are basically all different versions of the same thing), and we both ordered seconds. It's a small place - there's more seating on the patio outside than inside. The owner said he wanted to do a food truck - I think the menu is probably better suited for that.   This place kicks the collective asses of most of the fancy Arizona Mexican "Street Tacos" that you would find around the Valley. This is definitely more authentic... as others have stated, it's very much like something you would get in Mexico (though I've never had anything nearly this good in Mexico).

Short and sweet - This place rocks. I had sliders (which you can only get one day a week), and they were amazing. I love this sort of BBQ - it wasn't just a bunch of fiery red sauce all over your face and fingers. It was the other kind. Fantastic flavors here, and a great location and atmosphere. Met the owner as well, and he's really nice and passionate about his food. There's nothing wrong with that. They do basically one thing and they do it right.

Let me start by saying that this place is outstanding.   I'm relatively new to Thai, and this is a new restaurant. They opened where a previous restaurant closed. Looks like they totally remodeled. It looks fresh and clean inside. The staff and owners are way nice and friendly and attentive.   I'm becoming a big fan of Thai food. Even though I haven't had it loads of times, I can tell you that this is probably the best I've ever had. I've eaten out enough to be able to say what's good at least, and Thai Basil is wicked good for sure.   It's awesome that they deliver as Thai places normally don't, but a shame they don't deliver to my house because I live too far away. We're probably going to be getting takeout from here a bunch.  I had their signature dish with beef - it was amazing. I got medium spice which was perfect if not a little less spicy than I would've liked for most of the dish, but when I got to the end, it definitely started to kick in. I would start with medium unless you like things really hot. Mild for those who are less adventurous. We also got a coconut curry yellow chicken dish which was awesome as well. Their spring rolls and fresh rolls are both vegetarian and both in my top 10 of all time for any Asian restaurant... perhaps in my top 5.   The portions were huge. We got 2 entrees and 2 appetizers for the two of us, and luckily my girlfriend's sister came over to help us eat it because there's no way the two of us could've even dented it by ourselves. There's enough food here for 3-4 people. I don't know if it works that way when you dine in, but I ordered mine to-go and there was so much food.  We got Thai iced tea as well, and it's easily the best I've ever had.   Normally, I give it a couple of days or so before I write a review, but I'm sitting here having just finished eating - feeling content with a happy tummy and I just had to write it down. Anyway - I love this place. I will be back for sure.

Ordered a philly with chicken instead of steak and provolone cheese. One of the tastiest chicken phillys I've ever had. Chicken was tender and flavorful and cooked perfectly. The portion was generous as well.   Geno's looks like some huge national chain,, but it's a small local chain owned by a few different people. I've never once been disappointed by their food or service. This location is no exception and I'm a huge fan.

I don't often get over to this side of town, but I was referred to this place by a friend who owns another restaurant nearby. I went in and met with the owner who was really cool - it seems to be a family-run business - I think his parents are cooking the food. It was their grand opening (according to a hand drawn sign outside), but they could have been open for years the way the place was set up. It's clear they have run restaurants before or worked in the industry at least.  This place has a large dining area and it's a lot nicer inside than the outside would have you believe. The place is clean and smells good too. What's even better is that this place delivers... from 27th to 75th ave and from Buckeye to Bethany.   I ordered the General Tso's Chicken with rice, some egg rolls and some wontons. It's always good to gauge a new restaurant by standard staples of the cuisine (that's why my first orders at pizza places are pepperoni etc.). First off - don't let the low prices fool you - the food is DAMN GOOD. Both me and my girlfriend devoured the egg rolls and wontons immediately and wished we had more. We both decided the chicken was on our list for being among the best we've had.   I mean, for Chinese fast food that will deliver to your house, this is about as good as you can expect. It's clear they care about quality and speed and they seem really excited to be opening their own business. I really hope this place does well.   Check them out!

I want to start off by saying that the participating restaurants weren't to blame for what was wrong with this event - the tacos were all delicious. My problem with the event was that it was extremely disorganized.   It was damn near impossible to get a drink or to stand in the shade or to even get into the place. I tried not to hold a grudge on the line to get in, but holy hell. It was all enough to discourage me from coming back. If this was the first Taco Festival, I'd be more understanding. I'll bet the layout made total sense before they let people come inside. They need to check out a few Tempe Town Lake events to see how it's done.  There were several Valley events running concurrent with this one (like Tour de Fat)... Next year I may do something else. Overall though, I'm glad I went. I was able to sample some really tasty tacos. The offerings from Vitamin T, Cien Agaves, and Blanco's were excellent. We didn't have a single bad taco actually - can't recall every place we tried, but it was all good.   I probably will go again at some point because I love tacos and I love to support good local restaurants, but I'm not in a hurry.

Top notch cheesesteak. One of the best in the valley. This place has a large delivery area, and is located right by campus. The owners are really nice and friendly. I'm really glad something moved into this spot. It's so convenient.   Their desserts are great as well. I wish they had some chicken options, but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on. My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic. They sometimes carry Tasty Kake, so ask about that.   I've had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly, and this tastes every bit as good if not better. It's definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks.  Edit: Just ordered delivery - Lightning fast! This place is incredibly legit. I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of "wiz" this time - So incredibly good. They tossed in a new dessert they didn't have last time which was awesome.   Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious. I'm a huge fan. I'm not kidding with this 5 star rating - I love this place. Rave rave rave...

Food here is fantastic. Service is great. Location is convenient. It's likely to become my new neighborhood bar. I don't know why I waited so long to come eat here, but I'm glad I finally did.   I like the setup of the bar. It's all inviting and open inside. It'll take awhile before I feel like a regular, but I feel comfortable here right away. The menu has something on it for everyone. If you're so hungry that nothing sounds good, Spokes will have something that'll jump out at you. They also seem to pride themselves on their beer options as well.   Coming from Old Town area where British Open, Papago Brewery, and Frasher's (RIP) were my favorite little local places. Since I moved to Tempe, I haven't really found anything that could live up to that... until now.   I'm looking forward to coming here a lot.

Hummus Xpress is legit! One of the best fast-casual restaurants in the Valley. Metro Phoenix is lousy with Mediterranean restaurants, and that's a good thing. I had a conversation with the owner about this, and we both agreed that Pita Jungle played a big part in spreading the growing acceptance and consumer love for this delicious cuisine.   The Mediterranean restaurants in town are all pretty damn good for the most part. I would be hard-pressed to pick a favorite. This one is right up there at the top of the list. In fact, I may just go ahead and make a list.   The way you order here is similar to eating at Chipotle or Q-doba, but instead of tortillas you're getting a pita and different fixings... except cheese. Pretty much everything you could pile onto a plate here is healthy, and it's all fresh. This would definitely make this a great place to try as your first foray into this type of food if you're a virgin.  The kitchen is immaculate and you can see it all from the dining room. The service is friendly and quick. And of course, the food is fresh and absolutely delicious. Since you get to pick what you want to eat, if you don't like it - it's pretty much your fault. I had a pita with beef and fixings, while my girlfriend had a chicken plate (which also comes with a pita, but you get extra protein). We both ate ourselves stuffed.   This strip used to be kinda dead - this spot used to be an always-empty Chinese place where the owner didn't give a shit anymore, but the new owner cleared out all remnants of what it used to be and transformed it into something great. The neighbor at Detroit Coney Grill did the same thing, and now this strip is bustling.   Hummus Xpress delivers (like actually delivers food to your door), so there's really no excuse to not try it. It was easy to give 5 stars here... I love this place. I will most definitely be back.

This is a little hidden secret inside the Optima. The decor is classy and comfy. The staff is super nice and welcoming. The food is top. They have great happy hour specials, and could really fill the gap left by our usual place that closed.  The tacos were absolutely delicious and we had to fight over them. The hummus was great as well. Everything we had was a delight. All of the dishes here come camera ready and want to be instagram'd. The portions were perfect as well - we felt great after we left.   If you live within walking distance, they might even deliver to you - wouldn't hurt to call.

I believe this place is by the same owner of the two restaurants next door. It has a nice patio and a relaxed atmosphere.   The food ranged from good to excellent. The cocktails were not, but the bartender was so obnoxiously cute I would've probably choked down whatever she could wring out of the bar towel. I'm lucky my gf doesn't mind if I'm a creepy ogler once in awhile - she thought she was hot as well.   The drinks we tried had either too much alcohol or were too sweet. They were really accommodating and sweet to us, so we felt bad saying we didn't like them.   Anyway, regardless - the mac and cheese stood out, and we liked the salsas and guacamole. We will definitely go back.

This restaurant is Delivery Only, but they are fast and delicious. We had Lasagna and salads and garlic bread. It's a cool concept and pretty unique as well. If you're looking for good Italian food that isn't just the usual Pizza etc...   The prices are low and the food portions are huge. They have online ordering that is also mobile friendly. Great place.

I'm not a fan of Country music unless it's performed by punk rock icons from the 90s, Lou Reed, or Johnny Cash. That's okay though, because I'm old enough that I can tolerate things I don't like a lot better than when I was younger. What I'm saying is that I can get past the music playing on the speakers... especially since it isn't loud enough to split my ear drums. Besides, it didn't seem to be overwhelmingly Country - no one was wearing a cowboy hat and there wasn't hay all over the floor.   Having lived in the Valley my whole life, I'm pretty familiar with this place. It used to be a music venue and I've seen quite a few shows here. And that's all I ever did back then. It was never a place to go unless there was a band playing. It's a bit of a hidden location that you don't always think about when you're hanging around Mill. That's a shame too, because it's a great space. It's large and well laid out. It's decorated cool, and their signage is neat looking. There's also a great big patio with heaters and a nice social bar.   I went in during the day mid-week just after they technically opened, and it looked like they were doing a deep clean. I was able to meet the owner and even got to check out the kitchen. The kitchen, I can happily say, is super clean (thankfully, since I saw it after I ate). The staff seemed pretty nice, and the owner was cool and enthusiastic (which is a good sign).   I wasn't there for a drink, but I did get to try some quesadillas (not on the menu yet) - steak and chicken. Both were excellent to the point that I would go out of my way to come back and eat them again. The food here is pretty high-end for the prices, and the owner tells me they are going to start delivering it around the area. Gotta love when a bar and grill delivers food.   I mean, sometimes bar food is cheap and crap and it's just there to soak up alcohol, but other places the food is a loss-leader to get you in the door to order drinks - two of my favorite places to eat are bars. This is one of those places - the food is pretty great, and bonus to the neighborhood that they will deliver. I hope this place sticks around. It seems like a cool place to chill and drink with friends. I'm sure late-night weekends this place is packed.

Outstanding new restaurant in Old Town - looks like 3rd time's the charm in this location.   Previous owner(s) had tried a few different things that apparently didn't pan out. Well, the new owner of this spot apparently knows what's up.  The specialty cocktails (which I'm not normally into) are fantastic, and their wine on tap is awesome. The food is out of this world - it's all different. They are really into locally sourced fresh ingredients and being earth conscious (which I really appreciate) and you can taste the difference in the food.   I had a pepperoni pizza and shared some bruschetta that was crazy good, and my girlfriend had a chicken dish I sampled that was also amazing. The cheese on the pizza was creamy - it was really unusual, but I scarfed down every bit of it. The crust was delicious as well.   The best part is that I don't feel boated or whatever. I was full, but didn't have a gut bomb. We even split a dessert that was like their take on an adult s'more. It was ridiculous.   Evo should be a yelper's paradise. This is going to be a really hot spot for an after work happy hour when you don't feel like having a Corona and chips and salsa. It's also a fantastic spot for a date night. It's an awesome place for locals to come and unwind with a drink and some noshes.  There's a really comfy atmosphere and everyone that works there seems passionate and welcoming. I hope they keep it up after the "we're new" wears off. I wish this place all the success and I hope it's around for years to come. I'm definitely going to be back here lots. Had a wonderful time and a happy tummy.

Went here on an adult field trip with my girlfriend. It was a great date activity. It's a little hot to be going here in the Summer, and it's definitely humid inside with the butterflies, but it's worth going for sure.   We went ahead and bought annual passes because that's like our thing now - annual passes for shit we'll end up going to just once or twice. We were bummed to find out we had just missed the lifetime passes - they stopped selling them.   But there's a ton of cool stuff to see here besides just butterflies, and the 3d movie was entertaining. We got our money out of it. The photography opportunities here are fantastic. I brought my dslr and snapped off a bunch. If you're into photography at all, this is a great place to go as well. The atrium is well laid out and there's even a nice koi pond in the middle... we probably wandered around for a good hour and a half or so.   Watch your step - you may squish one. They are pretty good about cleaning up the casualties and they are also good about warning visitors not to be dicks - but people are dicks so you may see some trampled on butterflies. Just be aware.  If you're a parent and bringing your children here and they don't understand death yet and will cry when they see a dead butterfly and you aren't ready to have that talk... or they misbehave and pull wings off or kill insects because you are raising a serial murderer - then this probably isn't the place for you. Take your kid to the playground at McDonalds and feed them a happy meal. This is a more sophisticated outing for a more sophisticated child and parent. It's an educational thing and also might spark a love for butterflies.   Dudebros - this is a great place to take a chick on a date - but maybe not in the Summer - her makeup will sweat off her face and her hair will frizz out. If she's cool with that, then you've got yourself a good one. If you're not cool with that as a dudebro, then maybe you are shallow and should talk to someone about it... I don't know.   The giftshop is neat and filled with some good stuff, but it's all very expensive. Overall, it's a great experience that doesn't cost much more than going to the movies and provides a much more unique experience.

Grabbed some take-out on my way home today... got a foot-long French Dip (which at this place is kinda like a Philly, but without onions or peppers) and some chips... would've got some fries, but i didn't want to risk them losing their crisp on the way home.  First off, this location has been a few other restaurants over the last few years, and I liked all of them - which on one hand is great because it's so close, but on the other hand is a bummer because it's a bit of a hidden spot so I guess in the past these restaurants didn't get enough business to stay open. Hopefully that won't be the case here.   Had a chat with the guys working there, and it turns out the place is run by locals who grew up here like I did. We talked about the old days of Video Roundup and other stuff in the area that isn't around anymore. They seem like great guys, so I hope this place does well.  Anyway - I almost couldn't keep myself from attacking the bag on my way home as the smells coming from the container and filling up my car were intoxicating - also I was starving. When I got it home and tore it open, I was faced with two beautiful giant sandwiches... Holy shit. The bread was a 12" roll which ended up getting cut in half, but each half was stuffed with enough meat to probably fill the whole roll.  Challenge accepted.  I was pretty full after the first half, but I powered down the second half... but I didn't quite finish off the bag of chips... full-size bag by the way. Usually places give you tiny snack size bags, but they gave me a big grab size or whatever it is. Anyway - not only was it a ton of food, but it was awesome as well. Every bite was joy. I'm totally ordering from them again... and again... and again. They deliver, so I'm pretty excited about that. Even though they're like walking distance from me, I just like being able to summon food.

This place is kinda far from me, but I stopped in to check the place out since it changed from Two Guys Pizza or whatever it was. I went in after lunch, and it wasn't super busy - but they still had a steady stream of customers coming in. Neighborhood locals who were apparently already all hooked on their food.   The owners were an adorable young couple - both originating from other Countries before moving here. They were fun and charming. We had a nice chat before I got fed. I like them and hope they do well... going by the other reviews here, I have no doubt they will - even in the unassuming little corner location.  So I ordered a Cheesesteak because my diet lately has been pizza and cheesesteaks and I need to cool it and start eating more salads and going to the gym, but a cheesesteak sounded good and that's what I wanted, so shut up!   Anyway, the sandwich was unlike any cheesesteak I had seen... they make their own bread for the sandwich, and it seems to be based on the pizza crust dough. It was one of the most unique cheesesteak sandwiches I've had and easily in my top 5 in Phoenix. The meat was tender and flavorful - perfectly seasoned.   Now, I know that most cheesesteaks in the Valley are made of the same meat - most restaurants get their sliced ribeye meat from the same vendor. The reason some places taste better or worse is due to a number of factors - how they store the meat, how they season it (if they even season it at all), and how they prepare it. That being said - this is definitely a place not to be missed.  I asked another patron to see their pizza they were picking up as she was leaving and it looked and smelled amazing. If I wasn't so full and if it wouldn't have been ridiculous, I might have ordered one of those to go so I could eat it for dinner or breakfast or whatever. I'm glad I didn't because I was full until I went to bed. I didn't feel bloated or anything - just full as in not hungry.   I also saw a calzone being prepared - gigantic/epic.   This is a top quality restaurant. I'd drive out of my way to come back here... probably will.

Best thing to come out of Detroit since Robocop.  This new fast-casual burger and dog joint looks like it might as well be a seasoned chain, but it's a new concept in a formerly failing strip. This and the neighboring restaurant, Hummus Xpress, have resurrected this location from the dead.   The food here is fantastic. Everything seems fresh and high quality. Even though the prices are fast-food low, you're definitely getting a lot of bang for your buck. The owner is pretty nice and has a lot of experience running local restaurants. He's usually there and he is very proud (as he should be) of his place and happy to tell you all about what you're eating and how they grind their own meat for the burger patties. That's always a good sign for me - an owner and staff who give a shit about their restaurant.   I ate a double cheeseburger with bacon and avocado and paired it with some curly fries. It was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley. If you're a big fan of In and Out Burger or Five Guys, you should really give this place a try because it's not only better, it blows those places away. You can get your burger topped with just about whatever you want, and after you order you can watch them disassemble a whole potato and toss it in some hot oil for you.   Don't be intimidated or discouraged if you see a long line out the door at lunchtime because it moves really fast, and the register is up near the door so that's gonna happen. Rumor has it that they might start offering delivery soon after lunch. Makes me wish I lived a little closer. With the kind of detail and thought that went into this concept, they might have plans to open more locations eventually - looking forward to that.

This is a good solid little inexpensive hidden pizza joint. Everything is handmade right in front of you if you pop in, and they deliver as well. Celas's has been open for a long time, but hasn't ever appeared on Yelp. The owner is really nice and so I figured I would help him out and put him on the map.   It's not a fancy place by any stretch - there are still a few small remnants of the Pizza Hut this used to be, and it isn't candles and tablecloths. Don't expect to be wowed by the atmosphere, but the kitchen is clean and it smells good inside. For the price, you're going to be hard pressed to find much better.   The 5 stars are for the value you're getting here... the bang for the buck. I'm not ready to put this on my list of top pizza joints in the Valley, but it's certainly a good little hidden neighborhood option.

Yet another new solid pizza place in Tempe that delivers to me. The "personal" pizza we had was like nearly 12 inches (we were expecting more like 8"), and a lot of bang for the buck. The cheesesteak we split was delicious. We also ordered some cheese bread, and it was pretty unique compared to what I'm used to. Also very good. The pizza was really flavorful and good, and we could tell the ingredients were all fresh.   Everything we had was great, and it arrived fast. The customer service here was super nice as well. I don't like using the word "cheap" when describing something that was both inexpensive and good, but really - the prices here are low for what you get. Great bargain. This location used to be a different pizza place, but after sitting empty for months, I'm glad to see a new tenant int he space. I'm double glad that the food worths.    When I first moved to this neighborhood a few years ago, there was only a handful of pizza places that delivered to me besides the Hut and Dom. Now there's a dozen or so local places offering pizza delivery... and a few dozen more offering all types of different cuisine. I love choices. If you're like me, you like to support local restaurants like this one. Do it.

This is a brand new place that delivers to my house. Tried them tonight for the first time. I ordered a small (14" - pretty big actually) pizza with pepperoni and sausage, and some garlic cheese bread. The cheese bread was similar to Papa Johns in flavor, but somehow better. The pizza was pretty delicious - flavorful pepperoni, small italian sausage pieces (but plenty of them), the cheese was good and there was a generous amount of it... sauce and crust were good. I mean, it's pizza.   I've decided that I just like pizza a lot - this might explain why I give so many positive reviews of pizza places. I just like being able to summon food to my door and it's still hot and tasty. I also like to support local businesses. The food here is good, and the prices are low, they deliver fast, and they're nice on the phone. This is a solid choice - and I think they are open super late.  I'm told they are going to have online ordering soon, but it doesn't look like their website is up yet.

This is a brand new location for this healthy fast-casual smoothie chain. I've never eaten at one before this, and I wasn't even aware they had food aside from just smoothies... but oh man, they do, and it is good.   I had a Chipotle Chicken Flatread thing which was kind of like a soft taco eating experience, but it was on a soft fluffy pita type of bread. The chicken was super tender and flavorful - perfectly cooked and beautifully seasoned. Most places overcook chicken which makes it tough and chewy, but the chicken here is juicy morsels of deliciousness. My sandwich also had bacon and cheese and veggies inside - all of it tasted just as fresh and delicious.  The prices here are unbelievably low for the quality you get as well. My sandwich was only like 4 bucks, and it was better than similar meals I've had at twice the price. It's so much healthier eating here than at a fast food place, but the price point seems to be in the same league. I know there was bacon and cheese in what I ate, but I still feel like I did my body a favor eating here instead of somewhere like Sonic or Subway or BK etc... It's strange because the prices here suggest those as their competition, but the quality of the food and fast-casual setup suggests more upscale.   I suggest you eat here before they come to their senses and raise the prices appropriately. This is a family owned franchise... really nice folks. If you twisted my arm to come up with a gripe, I would say that the noise from them whipping up smoothies can get kinda loud if you're dining it, but this is the same issue at all smoothie places. Who cares. This place is great, and I'm going to put it on my list of places to hit up. Looks like there are less than a dozen locations in the Valley with more on the way.

Brand new sub place from the same owner of Fat Boy's Pizza.  Ordered a Turkey, Salami, and Cheese sandwich - it came on a fresh and fluffy toasted roll. The meat was fresh and high quality. I got it to go, but ended up wolfing it down in the car on my way home. It was really good. I usually just get a basic meat + cheese + bread sort of sandwich, but they do offer lots of goodies for free with your sub. I would have gotten avocado, but they had just recently opened and hadn't gotten any yet.   The prices are really low here, the menu is simple, and it's quick. Even better - they deliver in the area (pretty far too).  If I lived closer, I would definitely eat here all the time. My last office job had me commuting and I would pick up a sandwich from a place just like this every day on my way to work. Any time I can buy local over eating at a mega chain like Subway or Jimmy Johns, I'll do it. This place is probably cheaper, and you definitely get more (and higher quality) food for your buck.

I had a dog with a pretzel bun outside the Reggie and the Full Effect show. The truck's engine had the flu or something, but Adam still managed to post up a portable setup and be there as promised.   It was one of the best hot dogs I've ever had, and I'm not just saying that because we're friends. The dog was gigantic and cooked to perfection, and you can't go wrong with a pretzel bun. As I stood there with a gob full of meat and bread telling him how great it was, he shrugged it off and said "making a good hot dog isn't complicated." and he's right - it isn't. Still, it's easy to get it wrong. Plus, I didn't quite get the full experience one would get at his truck where he's able to get really creative with it.  I've known Adam for years - we started out as poker buddies, but I watched him develop and follow his passion for cooking. I've had his cooking several times over the years, and it has always been good. I'm happy to see him with his own truck and business, and I hope it's an immense success... he deserves it.   He uses only the finest ingredients, and he's one of the most creative chefs I've met. There's a reason he keeps appearing in newspaper articles and online interviews. He's about as close to a local celebrity chef as we've got, and he's just getting started. Go check out his website, or follow him on facebook to see where he's going to be next and do yourself a favor and go try one of his creations. You'll thank me later.

Popped in today to check this place out as I've always been curious. I chatted with the owner for a bit. He was extremely nice and seemed passionate about the place. He gave me a couple of samples which were both delicious - one had a hunk of real fruit in it. Really flavorful. I left with a mango flavored Ice, and it was pretty amazing.   I'm new to this sort of cold treat - it's not ice cream, and it's not sherbet or sorbet or yogurt or frostee or shave ice or gelato. It's something else. It's surprisingly rich and flavorful and creamy for being ice based. It stayed cold in my car for over an hour - even had to leave it in the parked car for like 25 minutes at one point. I was surprised it held up and didn't just turn into flavored water.   I meant to save some for my girlfriend, but I finished it off before I got home. I'll have to go back. Good thing it isn't that far away. If you've ever been curious, it's worth your time to stop by. It's May and currently heading into the 100s with Summer basically upon us. Knowing this is here and that they have refreshing and tasty low calorie alternatives to ice cream means I'll be returning.  Yum.  Oh, and as for the decor - the place is nice and clean and smells pleasant. It's decorated kinda kitschy - as though the owner is a collector of old cool Americana style artifacts. It's pretty neat.

Q: Who makes a really good Chicago style deep dish pizza here in the Valley besides (some) Rosati's?  A: This place does!  I ordered a deep dish to go - it smelled and looked so good, I ate a slice right there and took the rest home. It was absolutely delicious. He uses quality ingredients. It's not dissimilar to my good experiences with Rosati's, but it does have a fairly unique flavor profile. It somehow tastes a little more Chicago.   I can't eat deep dish pizzas all the time without becoming a giant ball of lard, so this will have to be the occasional treat for me. I'm definitely coming here again though. I'll probably have to try their thin crust as well.

This place is rad. It's a themed pizza joint based on nerd, geek, and video game culture. They just opened, and they're still a work in progress with the decorations, and I think they are still even perfecting their menu, but it's already shaping up to be cool as hell here. I can picture as time goes on, this place will just get more eclectic and interesting.  The focus of the theme is old Nintendo video games from the 80s and 90s, and geek culture from comic books and cartoons to action figures and quirky toys. There's definitely a Mario Bros inspired theme here. The menu has some cool item names that are clever call-backs to video game terminology.   It's the sort of place you might expect to find in Austin or Portland (you know - where cool people live)... or even in Tempe. I was surprised most of all to find it in West Phoenix in an older strip mall - not really near any other cool or hip things. It's almost out of place where it sits, but that's perfect since it stands out. We need more stuff like this all over the Valley. The West side some cool and unique restaurants, but they are few and far between. It's good to see stuff like this pop up.  I have a feeling that this place will keep evolving into something even more quirky and cool if the owners keep tinkering and turning all of their ideas into reality. Chatting with them, I can tell they are passionate about this stuff.  In spite of being relative newcomers to the pizza biz, they make an excellent pie. I had a Boss Battle, which is half pizza and half cheese garlic bread. It's perfect. Their dough is thick and fluffy and tastes good. Their sauce is very flavorful and different. It doesn't come out of a can, and they are still tweaking it, but it's delicious. They don't skimp on the cheese or the sauce or toppings either, and the pepperonis are spicy and tasty as well. I'm not gonna say it is the best pizza I've had in my life, but it was seriously good. I'll go out of my way (and believe me, it's out of my way) to eat here again. Plus, you get a ton of food for not much money.  It's really important to our local economy and community to have great little local gems like this pop up and thrive. If you live anywhere near here, you need to order up some delivery or stop by for some take out or hang out and eat with friends and tell the owners you're pickin up what they're puttin down and that you appreciate their existence.   I wish we had more places like this on the East side. Metro Phoenix is so full of stuffy old conservatives that art and culture have to force their way in to our lives like blades of grass poking out through cracks in the pavement. Most people in Phoenix just play it safe with traditional names and themes when they open a restaurant (or other business). It's boring. Places like Super Pizza Bros need to be celebrated. Seriously. Insert coin.

Having recently traveled to Puerto Rico, my fiancee and I have been craving empanadas something fierce ever since we got back. We've tried a few places around town - from the East Valley to the West as well as North. We've experienced a good array of quality and variation. I would place Sydney's (with regard to their empanadas) as "fancy" as opposed to "traditional" (based on my limited experience).   I had an empanada and a Chipotle Chicken Club Sandwich. The sandwich was bonkers. The chicken was super tender and flavorful, and I enjoyed their sauce. I also ordered a desert empanada... oreo nutella... it was also insane. Loved it. Molly had a couple of empanadas - veggie and chicken, and a mango coconut dessert one. She was in heaven.   The staff was exceptionally nice, and the place was clean and well designed. It is the first one of its kind, but you can just tell they plan to make many more of them. It's a great concept, and if they keep service outstanding food like this, with top level service, they will make more.  This spot used to be the home of a nice little tea and sandwich joint which also had nice employees and good food. While I liked that place, I'm truly excited for this one, and it's definitely going to be a place I visit often and which I would recommend to friends from out of town.

I've got a very happy belly right now...   Geno's is a small local chain that seems more like a big National chain. I've been growing rather fond of this franchise lately. There are about half a dozen or so locations around the Valley, and each is owned by different people. This location happens to be one of my favorites (this owner's other location is my other favorite), though I do like them all.   Having sampled the cheesesteak a few times, I can say with confidence that it's superb and authentic. I've also now tried their pizza, and that's also excellent. There's a lot of flavor packed into every bite of food I've had here, and you get a lot of bang for your buck.   This is the sort of place you'll get a craving for. I'm slightly outside of the delivery range of this spot, but it's easily worth the drive. The prices here are great, it's clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious and awesome. Can't really go wrong. Not sure what else you would need to make a place 5 stars.

I used to get my cars detailed every so often and whenever I bought or sold one. I had a guy. He was amazing. Unfortunately, we lost touch over the years, so I needed to find a new guy. I turned to Yelp (which didn't exist back in the 90s when I found the other guy). Race Day had great reviews, so I figured I'd give them a shot...  The guy who originally answered the phone was nice and gave me a breakdown of pricing and made me feel comfortable. He answered all my questions and didn't make me feel rushed. We set a date and time, and I got my cars ready by removing all of my crap from inside.  These guys detailed 3 cars for me over 2 days. They did a 2012 SUV, a 2003 SUV, and a 1963 Station wagon. They were very polite, professional, and friendly, and they got super OCD on our vehicles. They sort of ran out of daylight on day two and didn't quite do as thorough a job on the '63, but it looked great inside and out, and considering the time and elbow grease they put in, I would feel obligated to pay more if they spent more time on it. The 2003, they managed to make it look like it had never been driven before... same with the 2012.   These guys do real detailing. That thing you get at the dealership or the car wash they call "detail" is not a detail. Even if it's expensive. What they do is wash your car and vacuum up your boogers. Real detailers get meticulous and it will take several hours. Neighbors driving by will slow down or stop to stare at your "new" ride.   If you ever get tired of your car and want to get a new one - get yours detailed. You will want to keep it, and if you don't, you'll get way more money out of it when you go to sell it (and it will sell faster). When you buy a used car, have it detailed to get all the strangers' amoebas out of it. Always get your car detailed when you go to sell it, you'll get your money back and more. Want to get your significant other a present? Have their car detailed. Even if it's a 15 year old Camry or whatever...   Anyway, I'm glad I've got a new guy for whenever I need a detail again or when someone asks me if I know someone...

I only ate a chocolate filled croissant here, but it was REALLY good. It reminded me of a place that I used to go to as a kid in Phoenix called La Petite Boulangerie. I'll have to go back for a crepe or panini or something.   Decor was nice and light. The place was clean and smelled fantastic inside. The air was literally delicious. Service was great as well. There's lots of seating and a lovely patio that doesn't face Mill. It's across from AMC Centerpoint.   That's all I've got. I'll update later when I try more things. ;)

Yes! A new pizza place near my house! I must investigate...   This is where Jamie's Pizza and Pita used to be. It looks a lot different inside now. It's much more clean and simple (Jamie's wasn't so much dirty as it was cluttered). This is the second location for Maya to open up this year. I hadn't heard of it before driving by today on my way home.  I ordered a 12" pepperoni and sausage pizza to take home. It was hand-made and ready pretty quick. The crust is thin and crispy on the outside - almost like a cracker bread. Toward the middle, it's softer. There was a good balance of sauce, cheese, and toppings. The pepperonis were spicy and flavorful, the sausage was good, and the sauce was solid NY style. Other than that, it didn't really strike me as NY style pizza that much. I actually preferred it to a NY pizza. It's more of an Arizona style really. The way the crust came out - it almost seemed like a wood-fired pizza even though I know it wasn't.  Overall, it was mighty tasty and I enjoyed every bite. They have an extensive menu which I haven't had a chance to explore yet, but so far so good.  They deliver and are only a few miles from my house, so I'm obviously going to be ordering from here a lot (as long as it stays consistently good). I like that the guy who made my pizza was wearing a chef's jacket. A+++ would order from again.

I'm not from Chicago, but I've been to several of the key places that serve as true pure examples of "Chicago-style Deep Dish" pizza. I also grew up on Rosati's (which came here from Chicago decades ago).   Here in Arizona, there's not a ton of places to get a Chicago deep dish. And I've seen a few of them close as well. I've been to a lot of them, and some I like more than others. Rosati's is great, but quality can vary wildly from store to store. Oregano's sells a deep dish... it's good, but intense.   Deep dish pizza in general is intense... it's a ton of food. It's also kinda weird if you haven't had it before. Sauce on top? WTF is that? It's almost like an upside-down cake made with pizza ingredients. It also requires you to wait a long time as they take like an hour to cook. But it can definitely be worth the wait.  Sanfratello's is a new chain that comes to us straight from Chicago. Tonight, I picked up a deep dish pepperoni and sausage, a caesar salad, and something called "pizza fritz." Their pizza boxes are pretty unique - they don't require employees to spend hours of their day folding boxes... it's a clever design that I've never seen before. It also seems like less cardboard, and it's more sturdy. Who cares though, right?  The food was delicious. I honestly wasn't expecting too much from the pizza, but it was excellent. It was lighter than a typical deep dish. All the flavor was there though. It was a great example of a good Chicago deep dish, but when I was done eating it, I didn't feel like I had a giant brick in my gut. The salad was good as well - tender chicken, clean fresh lettuce, crisp croutons, and tasty dressing. Can't ask for much more.   The pizza fritz were like a puffed pastry made from pizza dough sprinkled with powdered sugar. Pretty simple, but a nice little treat. Didn't seem like it was super high in calories like other desserts. It came with some chocolate dip, but we opted to put chocolate swirl cookie butter on it instead - because fat. Shut up.  The setup here is more or less pick up and delivery... they do have some nice yet very small tables inside, and a few tables on the patio. This location is set up similar to how most Rosati's are, but a tad bigger. Don't expect to bring the whole family for a sit-down meal.    Anyway, I like this place. Put one closer to my house.   Oh, they deliver too. (sadly, not to me).

Great sandwiches. Generous portions. Clean. Great customer service.  I took a sandwich home from here tonight. I had a chicken sandwich with marinara and cheese. I was expecting slices of grilled chicken breast, but it turned out to be shredded chicken. I didn't get to eat it until about an hour and a half or so after they handed it to me, but it was still totally delicious. I pretty much expected the bread to be a soggy marinara mess, but it wasn't at all. The bread they use is awesome. I had the soft french bread. Overall, the sandwich was REALLY good - especially considering how long it sat in the bag before I devoured it.  The owner and staff were super nice and friendly. The place was very clean as well. It's set up sort of like a Quiznos, but it's clear the quality of ingredients used here is far superior. They will pretty much make you any sort of sandwich you can dream up. Their menu online has 150 sandwiches on it plus a build your own.   Looks like this restaurant is going to be a new local chain - I'm told they plan to open more locations. There are a few other choices for sandwiches at this intersection, but having tried the other places, I can safely declare this the best option.   While I was waiting for my food, a guy came in and said he's been to sandwich places all over the East coast (and listed some States known for solid sandwich shops) and that this was the best sandwich he's ever had. I mean, if I was a real professional culinary critic, I would have been suspicious that they paid him to come in and say all that stuff. But I'm not and it was legit. I don't know if it was the best I've ever had, but it was definitely good enough to make me want to go back.   Oh, and they deliver if you live or work nearby, so that's awesome.

The best Empanadas I've ever eaten in the Continental US.   I feel like I may have said something similar to that before, but this time I really mean it. This is better than Republica Empanada and Sydney's. Better than anything I've had in the Valley by far. This rivals the empanadas I had in Puerto Rico a few months ago (which spawned this new obsession of mine).   This spot has been 4 different places in 3 years. It's a little off the beaten path, but I used to live a block from here up until a few months ago, so I've checked out every time it was something new. This is the cleanest and nicest I've seen the place... the most effort put into this location that I've seen so far.  The new owner did a lovely remodel of the inside - new paint - clean and colorful... it looks like something you would find in Old San Juan. The owner is from Puerto Rico, so there you go... hence the authenticity. The chairs and tables are all new and fall somewhere between Herman Miller and High School... they are comfy though, and everything is really clean.   Staff is nice and attentive. It's only been open a week apparently, but since it's on Granite Reef and not a main road, they probably haven't gotten a lot of foot traffic yet. I will definitely have to come back here to sample more than just empanadas... the menu is extensive. Having eaten both the beef and the chicken empanadas, I can tell you that they are both incredible - I can only imagine how awesome everything else is.  This will end up being my biggest regret for moving out of this neighborhood... now I guess we'll just have a longer commute to eat here. They said they may eventually offer delivery, but sadly I'm afraid I am outside of their potential range.

This is THE BEST Cheesesteak I've EVER had.  If I've said this before, then that sandwich goes in the number 2 spot behind this.   I've known Adam for years. We used to play poker together. He's a successful culinary entrepreneur now - owner of three food trucks. I recall when he took a job as the cook at one of the local places where we played poker. The menu there was like 50 pages long with hundreds of items. He later went on to gain notoriety as a chef at other local restaurants... landing himself in the paper more than a few times. He's also been on TV a few times since he decided to start his own business.   He started with Frank Food Truck, selling gourmet hot dogs. Then he built Rounders - a truck selling ice cream sandwiches. Now, he is launching United Steaks of Cheese. He's got his own little empire going now. I really haven't hung out with Adam too much since our days playing poker - before all this chef stuff. It's always great to see him though. He always seems to be wearing a smile, so at least he's doing something he loves.   Tonight, I picked up a couple of cheesesteaks from his truck - one steak wit wiz, and one chicken cheesesteak with provolone for the fiancee (of course I sampled both, duh). It was a bit of a drive for me - tonight he was out in the East valley. I love the theme of his trucks - all unique and clever. This one is no different. It's an awesome wrap. I haven't tried Rounders, and I've only had Frank food out of a trailer he brings to smaller events. This is the first time I've actually pulled food out of the window of his truck. He gave me a couple of fist bumps and a smile before I took off. I'm not gonna lie though, I tore into the bag as soon as I got back to my car and crammed a few bites into my mouth. I also had to fumble around with it - shoving it in my face at stoplights while driving home.   There wasn't much left when I did finally get home, but enough so my fiancee could have a bite. She agreed with me that it was hands-down the best we had eaten... and we've eaten cheesesteaks IN Philly from one of the most famous places and from a local's recommendation and a few other spots. I mean, DeFalco's has a great and unique cheesesteak that is one of my favorites, but USOC's is the best of the traditional authentic Philly.   The steak was perfectly seasoned. Many cheesesteak places don't even season their meat, but this was easily the most flavorful and tender cheesesteak beef I've ever had. The "wiz" tasted like the stuff you get in the big fancy box of deluxe mac and cheese - somehow better than wiz I've had elsewhere. It's probably the same thing. I don't know. All I know is that when I was done, I licked the paper.   I. Licked. The. Paper.  The chicken was also seasoned great. Nothing remained of either sandwich. My fiancee sort of wished I had ordered the chicken wit wiz also instead of provolone. It was good either way. But to be honest, the steak stole the show. The bread used, I'm told, was imported from Philly. There's a couple places in town that import bread from Philly, but their bread is nowhere near as soft and chewy as this. I think some of the other places around Phoenix that import bread freeze them. I don't think that's the case here. Most places use the same frozen strip steak too - which is why most cheesesteaks in the Valley taste about the same (and why they can't even touch USOC's sandwich).   USOC definitely uses premium ingredients - it's clear in each bite. One of the benefits of running a food truck is that your food costs can be a little higher than they would be at a regular brick and mortar restaurant where rent forces you to keep your food costs low. You don't rent a food truck, you buy it. This means that food trucks often provide higher quality product to restaurants at comparable price points.   My fiancee said that Adam "hit this one out of the park." I have to agree.  Edit Feb 2015 - This review earned me some hate mail. He said I didn't know anything about anything, and that I was an idiot or something. He said cheesesteak meat doesn't need seasoning because it's smothered in cheeze wiz. I thanked him for his comments and we went back and forth until he private messaged me to meet somewhere to fight. I haven't had someone from the internet offer to fight me in person since the days of AOL. HAHA... oh, internet... you're so full of wondrous things.  Oh, and I ate here a second time (my gf picked us up a couple of sandwiches the day before my birthday), and it was as great as the first. I stand by my review.  Also - I do know Adam - the owner of this place - but I'm not a shill... He can go fuck himself right in the ear. See?

Gonna keep this short for once... Came in and grabbed a slice. It was fantastic. Dough is tossed, ingredients are fresh and flavorful, and the ambiance is super casual.   Met the owner too. Seriously one of the nicest guys. He was hugging customers, high fiving some local high school kids, and inviting people to a charity event to be held at this spot. It was to raise money for a little kid with cancer. The kid was just a customer - I don't even think he knew him beyond that.   But back to the food... It's excellent. Superb example of New York style pizza via the west coast. I like this place a lot. I'll be returning.

You could probably count the number of Puerto Rican restaurants in the Valley (worth going to) on one hand. And when we get a new one, it's a BIG deal.   FrinGo's Kitchen is a new place that opened up last week in Chandler. The restaurant that used to be here moved a few miles away. The new owners of this location gave the place a makeover. As you would expect, the inside is very colorful and inviting. There's plenty of seating and it's all comfy. It's clean inside as well. It's sort of fast casual I guess - you just walk up and order what you want and they will either call your name or bring it to your table depending on how busy they are, I'm sure.   I sampled a bit of everything while I was there. The owner was super nice and friendly (and bilingual), and he let me try a small amount of each of the chicken, the pulled pork, and the steak. I also bought some Pastillos - which are basically Empanadas - a few of each kind. The pulled porn was insane. I don't ever really get pork often, but this is some of the best I've tasted from any type of cuisine. The Pastillos were awesome. So much food inside each one, and they are large. I liked all of them, but my favorite was the ground beef (steak and chicken were excellent though - can't really go wrong). On food alone, they get a 5 from me.  It's obvious that this is a family-run place, and I'm told that they were originally from Puerto Rico. I've been crazy about Puerto Rican food since I visited there with my fiancee a few months ago. I can't tell you how happy I am that this is only a few miles from my house. I mean, I would prefer if it was walking distance of course, but we don't always get what we want. They said they might start delivering at some point... for now though, you'll have to go in to get it.

Gonna keep it brief...   This place is affiliated with Geno's - both are small-ish local chains, and both share similar menus and recipes. If you ate here when it was a Geno's and liked it, you won't be disappointed. Had a cheesesteak today here. It was pretty great - as I expected it to be. If you get one - order extra meat, and use their Z sauce.   I'll write more next time I order a pizza or something, but in general - I'm a big fan of Zella's and Geno's. This location is super clean, food is good, and staff is nice. Not much to complain about. I think the plan is probably to expand and build more of these - wouldn't mind having one by my house.

Is it 4AM? Are you HANGRY! Looking for authentic Street Tacos? Do you want them to be delicious? Don't feel like getting out of the car? Then this is the place!   I ate 3 steak tacos with red sauce. They were fantastic! As good as anything I've had in Mexico, and among the best I've had in Phoenix. The menu is simple. The prices are great. The staff is nice. It's open 24 hours. What's not to love?  They should be offering delivery soon, so that's amazing.   Go eat here!   Now!

New location for this burger franchise by the original owner. Place is really clean and freshly remodeled. Classy for a burger joint. Modern. Extensive menu covers way more than burgers. I'm told plans are to add pizza and wings next.   The food was fresh, quick, hot and delicious. My burger was cooked med to med rare. I can attest that they use quality ingredients. Fries were fresh and flavorful. Perfectly salted. Burger was pretty big. Much larger than fast food places.   Staff dressed in uniform. Not sure if they always do this, but it wasn't too busy when I was here at 3pm, and they were bringing food to the tables. Drive through opening soon, and delivery... This place will be unstoppable. Great addition to downtown.

This is a brand new hip neighborhood pizza place that opened up in the the little corner spot tucked behind Bosa Donuts that previously housed an Italian pizza place that had been around forever, but in decline for awhile. This space has been thoroughly scrubbed and jazzed up with new paint and furniture and a cool wall mural.   I don't think they've even had a soft opening yet, but they were serving food and nice as can be. This is a family owned place, and it's definitely designed to cater to the Arcadia area. The owner clearly has had previous restaurant experience.   The menu has the sort of standard fare you would expect from a pizza restaurant, but they have managed to stick in a lot of interesting twists for each category. So you can eat traditional or find something new. There's a lot of creativity behind the menu, and many of the clever dishes sound delicious.   I only had time for a slice, and since I'm boring, I had a traditional pepperoni and sausage. It came out quickly, but also piping hot and fresh - it certainly didn't taste like a slice that had been sitting around. The crust was airy and light. It was also flavorful and crispy. The sauce was very distinct and flavorful as well. Toppings were top quality - right down to the gooey stringy cheese.   I'll certainly be back. I'm told they will be offering delivery eventually.
