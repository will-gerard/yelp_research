The boneless wings were good but bad value. $5 for 5 wings. I can get some spicy nuggets at Wendy's for a $1 and they would be almost better than what I had at hungry howies. They should rethink their pricing.

Ordered from Amazon and paid for 2 day shipping. Package was supposed to arrive Wednesday by 8pm via OnTrac. I called at 8pm and they said that the package had arrived at their facility at 3pm and they failed to mark it as same day. She offered to have me come pick it up from their facility and I asked what is the earliest I could come by. She responded and said she didn't know and would get back to me. I said ok and realized I had not provided any contact info to her for her to "get back with me". What a bust.

We ate here today and were greeted at the door by a really friendly guy named Rhythm. He was awesome! Our order came out instantly and the staff was friendly. We got a 4 piece meal and the chicken was juicy, well cooked and just right. We got a free apple pie! I would for sure come back and would recommend this place over KFC any day.
