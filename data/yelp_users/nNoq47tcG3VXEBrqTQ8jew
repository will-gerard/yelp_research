Aaron, my new favorite Mephisto Shoe merchant, knows his shoes. My feet, legs and back were telling me to buy value in a pair of shoes and I found then with the help from Mephisto.  Instead of a pair of sub-par shoes per year I'm banking on a good pair of Mephistos every 4 years and that makes them entirely worth the investment!

Mmmm! Thank you Fiesta, lunch with you is always good.  I'd recommend the mixed burrito with shredded beef, beans, and cheese with no veggies.

You would think that Bed Bath & Beyond would sell bed frames and baths for that matter. One star for the laugh and one star for filling my small "as seen on TV" purchasing need, and dang it all I forgot my 20% coupon. Bed Bath & Beyond forced my hand to drive across the sea of parking to Walmart for a simple bed frame.

It is fun seeing good realtors doing good things! Great job John and company!! It kinda makes me want to buy or sell my house again...

Most flavorful burgers. If you like sweet potatoes, try the tots and ask to try all the sauces. I'm a Chipotle aioli kind of guy.

Jeremy delivered and spread 20 tons of rock in our back yard after spraying weed killer and pre-emergent, clearing the dead weeds and mowing the front yard.   He moved quick and delivered a good service with a smile. The yard looks great and clean. We'll definitely have them back!
