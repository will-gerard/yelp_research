I love this convention center! This was the third year I was here for Phoenix Comic Con. It is clean, the staff are friendly, and the location is very convenient right off the light rail stop 3rd Street/Washington or 3rd Street/Jefferson depending on the direction you're coming from. I know people complain that if they drive in they have to pay for parking but I also know that while one nearby garage charges $12 another close by charges $6- so if you really want to save some money just drive around the block. Both those garages are a very quick walk away.

Love the Postino Arcadia location. If you are in Phoenix and like wine, this is a hidden gem. Located right off of Campbell and  40th. There is a small parking lot and most nights it is Valet. Try the Bruschetta Board or the Proscuitto and Fig sandwich, on Chibatta of course, you will not be disappointed. It's $5 glasses of wine any day (including weekends) until 5pm... did I mention this deal was EVERYDAY?  I also love the ambiance at the Arcadia location, it's what the Central location is just missing a little of. The music is normally alternative and hip, on any given night you will see several patrons using their smartphones to run SoundHound or Shazaam apps to find out what music they are playing.  Since I moved away from Phoenix and down to Tucson I really miss this place, but whenever I am up I make a point to get to Postino. As the bumper sticker says "Drinking Wine at Lunch is Not a Crime." The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is due to parking.

Liberty Market is a great place in downtown "Historic Gilbert." As far as I'm concerned this place fits right in to the ambiance of downtown Gilbert. You wait in line to order, which is a bit different, and the line for brunch can get long. The other quirky thing is if you're in a group they would like you to order all at once so you get one number per table.   A little funny I think, but it's casual, delicious and well worth the wait. I had the Grilled Vegetable Scramble, and the veggies were cooked to perfection. Not soggy, over done, or underdone. Which is fabulous! The atmosphere is quite nice, with all the big windows that look over the beautiful downtown Gilbert area. Parking is also plentiful.  Funny note: bathrooms are amusing, you have to check them out.

The rooms and view were delightful as was the architecture of this facility. I also enjoyed their food and was impressed that they had egg-free desert options (a luxury for those of us with allergies). The bar's signature cocktails were also fresh and fun! That being said I had a bad experience with the front desk and check out service.  For this fabulous hotel I would've expected better customer service. I was here on business and with a large group who was taking care of my stay. When I checked out they said they had a glitch and they'd have to fix it to get that payment through the group and assured me they would work it out. A week later I checked my credit card statement online and sure enough they had charged the bill to my account not the business group I was with. After several phone calls I had it straightened out but I don't think it's acceptable for the front desk to assure me they would when clearly it wasn't within their power and something I needed to follow up on. I probably won't be back.

This little unassuming shop is tucked around the corner of a strip mall containing Big Lots. But once you step inside prepare to be amazed. Suzanne and her staff were absolutely a pleasure to work with! I saw Tuesday for my consultation and found my dream dress in just a few tries. They are upfront and cheerful and happy to help. There is also a 10% discount that they can offer you if you pay in full. The alterations costs were very reasonable and done impeccably well. Suzanne, the owner, is also one of the many seamstresses on staff and she is amazing.

In a world where printing and copying has become self-service this location still has A plus service. I went in because I was on my way to a presentation and realized I had left my materials at home. Luckily I had them on a usb drive so I high tailed it to a local "Kinkos." They have awesome little self-service machines for just that situation.  You place your credit card in, followed by your USB drive, and then select the file and if you'd like it in color or black and white and done it sends it to a printer. That's how it's supposed to work, but after looking at all the trays and not finding my print out I got the attention of a lady working there and she verified it had charged my card and that it didn't print she gave me a refund and then asked for my usb drive and printed it for me. It was a very small order but I must say the customer service had exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this location to anyone for printing.  As for shipping I didn't have the pleasure of trying that out on this visit. But I'm sure the customer service level is similar.

A+ Services is aptly named. I worked with them recently having a valve fixed on the kitchen sink in a rental condo and they were superb and pointed out a potential problem area (the faucet and disposal) both of which were cheap builder-grade when installed. Jeff, the plumber, not only told me it would be better to replace it now but gave me some names of good models. Unfortunately we weren't able to install that the same day but they were able to work it out with our renter and A+ Services was able to accept a card over the phone for the second half of the work.   Steve, the plumber, who came out on the weekend emailed us an invoice let us approve then began work and called for the payment over the phone. He also promptly sent us receipt first thing the next day.I would recommend these guys to anyone. They are incredibly professional and good at what they do.

I have had two root canals here, one a scheduled revision and one in an emergency. I must say the staff are incredibly understanding and helpful during this painful process. The doctors have great bedside manners and do amazing work. They helped save my tooth that was mangled by a dentist previously. I would recommend them to anyone and if I need another root canal I'll be back.

Let me first start by saying: I would STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! I was having problems breathing, what we thought was an allergic reaction to food. I had chest x-rays and sonograms to check for blood clots and about 2 hours into my admission I was finally given an albuterol treatment. This treatment did make me feel better, as it turned out it was a cat allergy (we figured out on our own later) waiting this long into my stay seemed pretty dangerous. At not one time did a staff member look into what I had suspected, an allergy. I spent 5 hours here with the doctors and staff scratching their heads... Finally I was allowed to leave after asking for about 2 hours.   This is a classic case of over-testing and over-billing at a rate of $1000 an hour, for a 5 hour stay and a total of over $5000. I immediately called after I received the bill to set up a payment plan and have already paid half of what I owe and yet still received a harassing call to pay. I explained I had paid half my balance and that I had a receipt to prove that. The woman apologized and said they didn't have access to that information.... update your system and stop harassing people who are paying! I would STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE, go to somewhere else where your concerns might well be heard at a lower rate per hour.

Oh Cornish Pasty Company... your acoustics aren't great and your tables do need a bit of cleaning but your food is so delicious I see and hear nothing else. The bangers and mash pasty coupled with a side of mushy pea is quite possibly the best thing I've ever had. Top it off with great service and a beautiful atmosphere and I'm in love. I have heard that they are opening a location in Vegas and implore anyone from management reading to open a Tucson location!

I visited Republic Ramen after getting a coupon at the Phoenix Comic Con. I was floored by the how many choices they offered in Ramen, most shops just have 3-4 options and absolutely nothing other than pork for the protein. I had the vegetarian Ramen with tofu and it was good- lots of delicious and fresh veggies- purple cabbage, chopped scallions, carrots, bean sprouts, and spinach. They have a tupperware of those wonderful red spices (I'm really not sure what they are but I love adding them to my Ramen) by the soda machine in the main dining area. Adding that to the Ramen you're able to control how much spice and how hot you want your noodles.  I am also very impressed by the beverage selection. They carry both Ashai and Ashai Black, a harder to find dark beer by Ashai, a Japanese brewery. Also they have OB a nice light Korean beer (technically a pale ale). I also sampled a boba tea for desert, their Taro is not the best I have had but it was still pretty darn good. All in all this was a solidly 4-star experience.

Zoolikins is amazing! I had taken a cloth diapering class down in Tucson, where I live, and the woman teaching it mentioned she initially went to this store. We were taking a trip up to Phoenix for another reason and decided to check it out. Boy am I glad that I did! We were able to talk to not only one but two staff members about the variety of cloth diapers. Despite having just taken a class covering all this I had NO idea how many brands/styles there were to this whole modern cloth diapering. But the sales associates were very down to earth explaining that it's like different jeans and it's really not as hard as it seems. Gone are the days of diaper pins and in are snappis (ask them about it - you will love it).   We ended up purchasing an infant starter pack that had water proof covers (3) and then pre-folds to use inside. Oh word to the wise their website also rocks and you can skype into classes on cloth diapering, baby wearing, and swaddling! Again so thankful to these people and their amazing store.

Oh the Asian Kitchen is amazing. The menu is divided into different Asian Countries but the best thing on the menu has got to be the Ancient House Special Fried Rice. It is just divine- not greasy or heavy at all. They wok fry the rice with egg, shrimp, and chicken. If it's your first time coming here I implore you to try this and you'll be coming back for more like the Drunken Shrimp and Chicken which has a great spicy peanut sauce.   The killer entrees come in huge portions, I normally have to take half of it home and enjoy later.  They also have a good sushi menu and a great sushi chef who is personable and pretty darn fast. My favorite sushi on the menu is the "It's Always Sunny in AZ" and the "Big Buddha Roll". The service is always great, the happy hour rocks, and they have live music on Friday nights. I can't believe this little gem is located in Mesa, but it's definitely worth the drive.

I came here for St. Patrick's Day and I must say I have experienced better even on a very crowded St. Patrick's Day. The bartenders were on point but the food didn't look that appetizing. I pondered getting the fish and chips but they just looked soggy on other patron's plates. Now this may be due to the hordes of people on St. Patrick's Day demanding fish and chips, so I'll have to give them another try on a less crowded day. For now, it was a 2 star experience.

Jimmy Johns has got to be my guilty pleasure. Love the Beach Club and the salt and vinegar chips. This location is fairly new and it does the JJ chain well. Although they do keep the music louder than I'd like. Great place, great sandwiches.

Postino never disappoints. I'm thrilled with their new downtown Gilbert location but more over their delicious bruschettas and excellent service. I went here for the opening party on St. Patrick's Day and had a fabulous time. The wine selection is, as always, superb.
