This was the worst food and the worst service I've ever experienced! The food came out exactly 4 minutes after ordering. Was hard as a rock as they had over cooked what was already made. When we asked about other options the waiter told us maybe next time we just shouldn't order the chicken and walked away. It was only after we returned the dishes uneaten that the manager came and asked what we wanted. Additionally, upon receiving the check, the waiter yelled at us to not touch it as we tried to point out how to split the check. Would never step foot in that place again.

Such a great place! The staff is so courteous. The rooms were kept very clean and smelt great. Loved the older hotel redone to be great again. The pool is salt water and very cool to hang out at. The roof top deck offers amazing views. The restaurant is some of the best salsa in all of Arizona!  Great that this is a gay friendly hotel as well!  Will be coming back here for sure!

This was my first time taking my dog here for grooming. I was amazed they got us in immediately with no appointment. It took them about an hour for all of it. Cost $40 for bath, condition, brush, and nail trim. Staff was super friendly! Would highly recommend!

Really cool place! Order each donut customized and fresh from the fryer! Best if eaten right away! Only $1 per donut!
