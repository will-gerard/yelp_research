THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE!! I took my car to get a simple oil change. 3 hours later it was ready. I picked it up and it had a HUGE crack in my windshield!! I called back and spoke to Chris who told me it was already there when I dropped it off. Told me a manager would call me tomorrow. Nobody called me. After calling back twice I finally spoke to George who said it was probably because I parked it in the parking lot (where they told me to park it) and someone must have walked by and hit it with a baseball bat. HOW ABSURD!! I told George to figure out what happened and he called me back a day later and told me that they have no notes of it being cracked and unless I could prove it they weren't doing anything about it. I called back and spoke to Chris and he said no he said they DID NOT note that. WHAT A LIAR!! We had a ten minute argument about how it WAS cracked when I dropped it off. THEN HE HUNG UP ON ME!! Terrible customer service and how can they crack a window during a simple oil change?!?! NEVER GO HERE!!

Great waterfall feature on the patio. Food was great and server was very knowledgeable. Potstickers are a must and so is the green chile Mac n cheese but definitely add carne adovado. Carne Asade fries were tasty but not for anyone who can't handle spice! Definitely recommend!

Good sandwiches and even better prices! Got 2 sandwiches for less than $9! I asked for a recommendation and got the pork Asian sandwich. It was delicious- the flavor was great and loved the bread. My boyfriend got the #11 Asian combination and liked it except for the head cheese on it. Heads up only cash is accepted!

Always great service and food. Recommend the chicken pesto sandwich, my friends and I get it every time we come in. Good selection of craft beers on tap. Back patio backs onto a lake with fire-pits. Inside you can bring your bike in and hang it up in the back. Also have a lounge area with games. Very kid friendly.

Best pad Thai I've had! Not dry and great flavor. Also had great pho here. On top of the food being delicious, this is the best service I've ever had! The ladies who work there are super nice every time I come in! Highly recommend :-)
