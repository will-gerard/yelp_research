I go to this dunkin or the one on warner around 3-5 times a week. Normally my experiences are really good for most part and my company really loves dunkin for our company meetings as the owner used to own a bunch of locations in new mexico some years ago. I purchased several of the pre-paid coffee books around the holidays where you pay $12 and get 10 hot coffees, just using the booklet of vouchers. At both locations they always allow me to get a iced coffee even though the voucher says hot coffee and almost all the reps at the drive thrus have been more than accommodating and some have even gotten to recognize me as a regular. WELL this morning that came to a halt as I went thru this drive thru on my way to work the MANAGER (WHO HIMSELF WAS WORKING THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW) COLDLY informed me that he would no longer honor that, and I replied that they had always done so at multiple locations, He reminded me that he was the manager and he would make sure it would never be honored again. I could not believe the rudeness of this manager, and I am in customer service management. From here on out I will take my business to the location on warner, not that this manager will probably care.

After a 4.5 drive in from az for a much needed little get away with my fiancee. We had booked our rooms for the flamingo week and half ago and purposely upgraded to their "Go" newly remodled king rooms.  I was quite disappointed to find out when i checked in 20 mins ago that all king bed rooms were gone and was given a choice of 2 Queens or a king studio. I thought well thats a no brainer, king studio? Wrong, at least the counter clerk was kind wnough to warn me that these were the "NON renovated rooms".. i asked if there was anything else available and only offered smoking rooms.   I know its not the end of the world, but being as we have a king at home, and had purposely upgraded to the "nicer" king room, i figured hey it happens, but the least they could do is give me a real upgrade?   Well the real disappointment happened when checking into our two queen bed yet "renovated" room.. Well renovated means new beds (nice enough) and flooring and wall stuff. But a tiny tv from 6 years ago and an ancient bathroom and tub..long story short, when giving me the room, they waived the $25 resort charge, which now i would have gladly paid just to have the room i booked. So with all that said, glad we are moving to a different hotel tomorrow night!  Icing on the cake! Woke up this am to go get some water and stuff from the vending machine. Our floor won't take dollar bills. OK.. go down a floor! Success! $3 for a bottle of water! A hot bottle of water! Have a good day flamingo!  Final pro tip. If you have a "white" valet ticket. That color can't be brought around when you call down to leave. Lol

We eat at this place regularly and honestly have never had a bad experience.  Their street style tacos are amazing and always fresh! By far my favorite is the burrito bandido!

Not sure which one of the 3 employees it was when we walked in, but someone needs to learn the use of deodorant. There was no customers present. The second i walked in the whole place reeked of b.o.! I couldnt stand it, made my eyes water. i am appalled that in a nice neighborhood like arcadia someone can not get basic hygiene!

Everytime I come here, my pup comes home exhausted from having such a blast here! The customer service is always on point and I love the puppy report card and video they send home afterwards!!!

Just had a great dinner. For my first time here it was overall pretty good.  We had a flight of beers and the chefs special with the prime rib sandwich and the pretzel sticks. I didn't find a beer i loved,  but most of them were decent.  Best part of the whole place is the ambiance.  Loved the wood everywhere and the misters in the patio
