This place is great!   I'm glad I found it through Yelp! I came in for an eye exam and possibly new glasses.  Note--the entrance is around the back, not in front like the other offices in the building.   Anyway, the gals at the front desk were friendly.  When I said I had an appointment, they looked and told me it was for the next week.  Oops!  My mistake (I guess).  Anyway, they gave me paperwork to fill out and went to see if they could squeeze me in.   They got the okay, and the technician, Laurie, put me through a number of painless tests.   She was friendlly and efficient.    Next I got examined by the doctor, Dr. Mastores.   She is probably the nicest doctor I ever met (probably good with kids).  She was also very efficient and knowledgeable.  She took the time to explain, with a picture they took of my eye and a plastic model, some issue with my eye.  It was something that I had for years but no other eye doctor had taken the time to really explain it.  I appreciated that.  She also gave me some samples for dry eyes.     While I was waiting for my eyes to dilate for another test, I worked with a helpful optician in the office to find some frames for sunglasses.  He offered some tips and I wound up ordering from them.  They said it would take a week.      All this examination plus the glasses cost only a little over $100 with insurance.  I thought that was pretty good!   I definitely would recommend this practice to anyone!

This is my first fancy restaurant in Arizona, and it certainly deserves to be one of the best; one I will return to for special occasions.   My wife picked it as a romantic spot for her birthday, and it didn't disappoint.   This place is awesome. You drive in, the palm-lined circular driveway instantly transports you elsewhere. The valet takes your car, and you pass through passageways of intricate lighting patterns. Warmly welcomed into the dining room, which is surrounded in brick, long drapes, and exposed beams to give a classy but comfortable feel. The chairs have nice comfortable cushions for a long stay.   Waitstaff were all friendly and as fast or laid back as you want them to be.   One thing that I really note is the bread course. Is the bread hot or cold? How is it served? Here, a small loaf of Italian bread with the signature dustings of flour, signifying an "artisan" bread, was served with a small bowl of fresh pesto sauce. The bread was hot, the crust crispy, the sauce deelish. It was a good omen.   The food was all first-rate. While I had a vegetarian string: yummy Quorn empenadas, pear salad, and the delicately fried stuffed squash blossoms, my wife had the escargots napoleon (she loved it), the lobster bisque (which I tried--great flavor), and the Meditteranean Lamb. I also had a side dish of potato puree--creamy garlicky heaven!   It is an expensive place, but I would say it is worthwhile, and definitely good for a special night. The food was delicious and servings reasonable: if you get all the courses, you can actually take some home! The dessert menu was quite extensive, too. I think enough to please everyone. I definitely would go back sometime--just make sure you have money in the bank, know what I mean?

Living in SW Phoenix, the closest I get to real Chinese food is the likes of Panda Palace, which doesn't use authentic Chinese veggies.  I've lived where there's really good Chinese food, and Desert Jade is worth the trip for the more authentic taste.  They use the Chinese vegetables like Bok Choy, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, and more.  The sauces are delicious too.  Making a special trip to come here 1/2 hour from where my wife and I live tells you it's worth it.  The lighting is kind of dim but intimate; the decor nothing fancy, but warm.  I ordered a small bowl of egg drop soup to start.  It was enough for two, and the waiter was nice enough to take the bowl and dish it out to two smaller cups to share.   The soup was very good, having some thin-sliced mushrooms and carrots in it as well, to give it extra flavor.  A pot of hot tea came with the meal and we got two glasses of ice water without asking.  I ordered as an entree shrimp and scallops with veggies, and my wife got the beef with ginger.  We got the brown rice.  After we finished the soup, it didn't take long for the entrees to come.  I thought the shrimp in my dish were exceptionally tasty compared to many places that have little tasteless shrimp.  The scallops were good, and there were plenty of vegetables in a light sauce.  My wife commented on her dish that the ginger was in larger pieces, packing more of a flavor punch.  The rice was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The servers were very attentive and cheerful, removing plates when done and refilling water as necessary.  I have been here a couple times before and have always been happy with the service and the food.  I would also recommend any moo shu dish: the pancakes practically melt in your mouth and the sauce is delicious.

Nuthin better after a few fun games of bowling down the street than a good Chinese meal at my favorite Chinese restaurant!   LOL  By the way, make sure to try their Chinese vegetables--they're authentic and delicious!

First off, know that this place is really more for take-out and delivery.  The couple tables seem more for waiting...it's really small and not particularly decorated.  But I ate here, as it was convenient.  I ordered 12 hot wings (can't get a smaller order) and 6 fried mozzarella sticks.  They give everyone their order like it's to-go, so mine came in boxes in a bag.  The wings were nice and hot...waited for them to cool down.   The fried mozzarella were good in that the cheese was nice and hot and gooey...something I could thoroughly enjoy as I ate them there.  However, the breading wasn't very tasty, and they seemed too perfectly similar to have been made there.  The marinara served with them was quite good, which would bode well for their pizzas.  The wings were flavored like Frank's Hot Sauce, with plenty of sauce.  Nice and hot in temperature, with enough meat on them, these were delish.  Most places fry their wings.  I couldn't tell for sure, as the skin had a slight crispiness, but didn't taste fried.  But I found out that they were.    So, basically, I was impressed and will return to try their (takeout) pizza!

Wanted to try a new place for lunch and this place is nearby so I figured it's about time I tried it.   Gotta love the ambience: As a Baby Boomer, I love all the classic rock album covers up on the walls, including some jazz, Sinatra--and classic rock music playing to go along with that.  Nice background without being annoying.  Tough decisions: both the burgers and pizza sounded good.  I decided on the burger.  Got a regular one with their fries.  My server told me the fries were "beer battered" and really good, even though they didn't make them in house, so I decided to try them.  I got my food in a reasonable amount of time, considering it was prime time during the week.  As others mentioned, the soft but tasty baguette holding my burger was different and tasty.  The meat was spread out a bit to conform to the long bun, which may have made it lose some of its juice--I didn't find it particularly moist, but then I did order it medium-well done.  The meat was tasty and had a light char-broil flavor.  My only complaint was getting a tiny chunk of bone (I guess) in it.  Maybe that means it wasn't highly processed?  The fries were nice and crisp but didn't have much flavor.  I got their vaunted apple and nut cinnamon bread pudding for dessert, which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  It was quite good.  While I won't rave about the burgers, I will definitely return to try their other dishes, including the pizza, which has several toppings which I don't see at other places, even nearby pizzerias.

Ever since I moved to the East Valley a few months ago, (heck, really, ever since I moved to The Valley 5 years ago), I've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant with fresh-tasting food and a more authentic feel (to me, authentic is as simple as using traditional Chinese vegetables like bok choy instead of zucchini)!  I believe I've found such a really good Chinese restaurant in Yao's.  And not only must the food be good...other restaurants got rave reviews on the food...but so too, the service.  Because good food can be soured by poor service.  Typical in some of these "authentic" Chinese restaurants: non-communative waitstaff or those who don't care.  Yao's was different...right from the friendly greeting when we entered to the cheerful waitress who stopped by every so often to check on us (granted, it was only late afternoon on a Sunday).  But the food was very good, too. Following the lead of other Yelpers, I ordered the egg roll.  It was indeed nice and crispy, not greasy on the outside, containing slightly crunchy, flavorful veggies and other ingredients inside.  It definitely tasted like they made it, not the common freezer-to-fryer ones found elsewhere.  The won ton soup in a cup was a small serving, mostly broth with a little shredded cabbage and stuffed wontons at the bottom.  Very light, not substantial, really just enough to warm you up a bit and move to the next course.  The moo shoo shrimp was good: all pancakes with contents were pre-wrapped by the kitchen, with hoison sauce on the side.  They stayed moist that way without crumbling or getting too soggy--just perfect.  Veggies were flavorful, as was the flavoring inside.  Shrimps were reasonable size, plump and tasty.  I definitely will be back again.

I was in the mood to go out for dinner after work instead of going home, and I was getting hungry, so took out my cell, fired up my Yelp app, and scouted for a good local restaurant.  I found one promising tasty Mediterranean fare among other things, less than a mile away, so I made my way over there.  Good thing I didn't "check in" before I got to the door--they were closed for "summer hours".  Note to newer people in Phoenix--make sure the restaurant you want to go to is open in the evening before beginning the trek!  So I went back to Yelp for another restaurant and now, in the mood for Greek, found another one nearby--practically around the corner.  Crazy Jim's.  Sorry, people.  Despite all the other rave reviews, I can not concur.    I went in and was seated pretty quickly.  The waitress was pleasant and set me up with some water.  I liked the tables with a design and "Crazy Jim" carved into them.  The other diners were real casually dressed with t-shirts and shorts--I felt dressed up with my dress shirt from work!    Since other Yelpers didn't rave about the hummus, I didn't order that as an appetizer, as it was also several dollars anyway.  There were two calamari salads, one with or without lettuce.  I went with the "Crazy Calamari Salad" with shredded cabbage instead of lettuce to try something different.  The good: the pita.  A nice hot basketful of the slightly charred pita came out, which was great, as many places seem to microwave it and then it gets hard. The not so good: The calamari salad.  I have had a lot of calamari, so I consider myself a pretty good judge of quality calamari.  This was not it.  The calamari was heavily breaded, which may be why it seemed on the greasy side.  The breading wasn't very flavorful, and the calamari could have been a wee bit more tender.  The cabbage was good, the onions plentiful and somewhat sweet.  There was some feta, olives, and pepperoncini, but it was buried under the cabbage and cucumber, so you really had to excavate to find it.  Disclaimer: I'm not a big cucumber fan, so I left a lot of that on my plate.  The oil and vinegar dressing that is on the salad isn't too flavorful--I added some balsamic vinegar that is on the table for extra zip.  Since I really hadn't eaten that much, I had room for dessert.  I inquired about them, and found they don't make their own, but decided to chance it anyway.  The main choices the waitress suggested were a "capuccino and chocolate mousse cake" (the menu said tiramisu--was this it?) and baklava.  I decided to try the cake.  A nice moderate-sized piece came out with a blob of white next to it.  The waitress explained that they were trying to serve it with whipped cream, but "it wouldn't keep its shape, so that kind of ruined the presentation."  Uh-huh.  Well, the cake was actually pretty good, but after I finished it, I realized I hadn't noticed much of a coffee taste.  But when I got to the parking lot, I burped, and I tasted it.  And that happened again.  And again.  What?!?!  Did they use coffee flavor or something?    Okay, so the verdict?  I've been to some other Greek places within a 2 mile radius of this place, as well as elsewhere in Greater Phoenix.  Do yourself a favor and try them--better atmosphere and food.  Unless their specialty is chicken, as some other reviewers seem to be saying.

My wife and I were in the 'hood after coming from a local business and were looking for a place to eat dinner.  I had previously did a bit o' searching on Yelp and this place looked like a winner.  So we checked it out.     As soon as we got out of the car, the beautiful smell of garlic wafted to our noses.  Mmmmmm, heaven (if you love garlic!)  It was a Wednesday night and when we got inside, we found it would be up to a 40 minute wait for a table.  We put our names on the list anyway and checked out the other option: no wait, if you can find seating at the bar area.  After maybe 15 minutes, a table opened up there, so we wound up sitting near the bar.  No big deal--there was a TV on, which wasn't loud, and the bar crowd wasn't noisy.  A waitress came shortly and took our drink order.   Shortly, a waiter delivered a plate of their signature warm soft garlic bread sticks to our table.  A delicious start to the meal!   We looked at the appetizers--several creative options.  We ordered the Calamari Steaks fra Diavlo, which turned out to be about the size of steak fries, covered with breading with a spicy tomato sauce.  The sauce wasn't too spicy, but we also asked for marinara.  Both sauces were tasty.  The calamari came out nice and hot to the touch, which kept them very warm, at least, throughout the eating.  They were nice and tender.  The only thing was I thought the breading could have been a bit lighter.  For an entree, I ordered baked cod with orzo tossed with spinach and sundried tomatoes.  It was a large enough serving for 3 meals (yes, I took the rest home).  The orzo, spinach and sundried tomato combo was colorful and tasty, and the cod was moist and flaky.  My wife ordered the strip steak with optional gorgonzola cheese melted on top.  It came with a triple serving of mashed potatoes--the real thing with pieces of skin in it, plus a bit of blue cheese on top, and some broccoli.  It was supposed to come with fried onion rings, but they weren't initially brought out.  When we noticed them missing, we notified the waitress and she brought them as soon as they cooked up some more.  I tasted them--the onions were nice and sweet.  And my wife's steak was cooked just the way she liked it.  We made room for dessert, getting the flourless chocolate cake, which was like eating a wedge of not-too-sweet fudge.  It was served with strawberry sauce and whipped cream.  A chocolate-lovers dream!  Throughout, our waitress was very cheerful and, while the place was busy, she was available when we needed her.  Nice, fun, casual place, with some creative and different ways of cooking some of American favorites in food.

I had reviewed another Grimaldi's in Peoria and happened to find myself in Old Scottsdale, looking for a good place to eat.  Lucky for me, Grimaldi's was there.    The wait was said to be up to 25 minutes, but for an outside table, they took my wife and me right away.  Firing up the propane heaters kept the bite out of the air.  To get to the point, this Grimaldi's did not disappoint either.  I think one of the standout qualities of their pies is the quality of the crust.  Of all the pizza spots in the Valley so far, none have really stood up to the "can you eat it without drooping" test.  Which is to say, with a couple of toppings, do you have to fold it to get it to your mouth without flopping over, or do you absolutely need a knife and fork to cut it up?  Grimaldi's pizza needs neither.  The crust, very tasty from the coal-fired oven, is crispy enough to pick up without need to hold it with two hands, and it holds the toppings well.  It's not greasy or drippy or any of that.  And when you take home any leftovers, the crust is still firm.  To me, that is the mark of great crust.    The toppings are flavorful, too.  This time, succulent sun-dried tomatoes, fresh garlic, and tasty artichokes shared the top of the pie with fresh white mozzarella.  The sauce is subtle but there.  I also ordered their Mediterranean salad, pretty much a standard Greek salad with lots of Romaine lettuce.  Cool and crisp, when they say a small size can be split by two, they are correct: the bowl looks small but it is deep.  I did split a large as I was hungry, but we did take home some of the salad and pizza.  Again we got the tiramisu, not made by them, but nevertheless melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Service was great: despite being very busy, our waitress checked on us several times and was very friendly.

In these days of turmoil in the world and a rough economy, a place where you can go to feel the warm fuzzies, be cozy, and get good value for your money would be what you're looking for, right?   Well then, you have found it at Bobby Q.  And even non-carnivores can enjoy themselves.  The moment I got out of my car the seductive scents of smokey bbq wafted into my nose.  Winding through the patio with a bit of a ramschackle look with plants and tin and who knows else (but it's all for show), I enter the inner sanctum:  spacious and with dark walls, high ceilings, big paddle fans, and a bustling atmosphere.  A cheerful hostess greets my wife and I and takes us to our table.  The seating is comfortable, and the lighting is bright enough to read the menus but low enough to enjoy.  Our waitress, Tiffany, is a real joy.  She is very cheerful, checks on us just enough, and gets the orders correct.  She came out in short order and answers all our questions knowledgeably, and soon brings out the first golden nuggets of our meal: complimentary corn bread (they look like muffins without the tops).  They are delicious: very warm, melting in your mouth, moist, and with little pieces of corn in them.  The accompanying butter is hardly needed.  The menu, of course, focuses on meat, but for those inclined towards other proteins, there are other options: grilled salmon and shrimp  for example.  My wife order the baby back ribs with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.  I got the grilled salmon, grilled veggies and pecan cole slaw.  I also had the "homemade" lemonade which came with free refills.  It was refreshing, but a bit on the sweet side.  I first got a side salad.  It was a decent size but basically iceberg lettuce with a few cherry tomatoes, croutons, shredded cheese and a little green pepper topped with red onions.  Warning: if you don't eat pork, they sprinkle bacon bits on top, which wasn't mentioned on the menu.  I got the blue cheese dressing, which didn't have lots of flavor but had real little pieces of blue cheese.  Soon the entrees came out, and they were good-sized.  My salmon was nicely seared and with a slight crispiness outside and very moist inside, served with a light sweet sauce on top.  The grilled veggies were green pepper, onion chunks, zucchini, and summer squash, served with a light vinaigrette.  Very tasty.  The serving size was about 1/2 cup.  The pecan cole slaw was good sized, with the right amount of mayo, and topped with the nuts (so if you are allergic to nuts, they simply can leave it off).  I wound up taking home 1/2 the fish and slaw and some veggies to make a lunch!  My wife finished off the 1/2 rack of ribs that she said just fell off the bone.  She took home some of the generous portion of mashed potatoes.  I tasted them: they were red skin potatoes with some of the skin in there and plenty of flavoring and very good.  While we had a generous meal, we felt for the benefit of our readers to press on and have dessert.  While "Death by Chocolate" cake sounded tempting, they were out of it, so we got Peach Cobbler instead. It came in a bowl: sliced peaches topped with a light pastry that was seasoned with the warming spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves (it seemed) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Along with that we received the complimentary mini-doughnuts dusted with sugar and cinnamon.  Those melted in your mouth.  Tiffany gave us both two, but they never made it home!   Oh, and the Peach Cobbler was delicious, too!  Verdict: this is a great place for families and couples and anyone else as it is very welcoming and has great food to suit most tastes.  Except probably not if you're vegan.  I left it with a nice warm feeling all over and the thought that I would return.  Yelpers: there is currently a discount of 10% off the bill if you mention it.

I am a fan of the "Vegetarian Sampler", a staple at many Greek or Middle Eastern restaurants.  This is usually dolmades, hummus, babba ghanoush, falafel, tahini sauce, and tabouli.  With plenty of warm pita to scoop it up.  Well, that's what it is here.  And I keep coming back for more.  On a recent visit, it was chilly outside and a bit inside, as well, so when I picked up a piece of pita and ripped it, the warmth of it in my hands made me feel good all over.  So did the other food.  The hummus is very smooth and with a pleasant garlic flavor, not too potent.  The babba ghanoush has that great smokey flavor and more chunky.  The dolmades were small and cold, so hard to really taste the flavor.  The falafel was warm and tasty, not too tender inside but not too hard.  Nice to dip in the tahini sauce.  The tabouli was lots of chopped parsley, with a bit more of green and red onion than I like, but refreshing.  The pita stayed nice and moist and warm through most of the meal, which is a mark of good pita.    There isn't much to the decor, but service is always quick and cheerful.  I've never been here when it is very crowded, which is good for me, but not for the business.  Hopefully they get more busy another time.  This place isn't too far from me, so I hope to try more of their offerings.  I've had Middle Eastern food that's better, but Phoenicia offers an excellent blend of convenience, value, and quality.  I'll be back!

I've been here twice for the pet show indoors in December.  It certainly is spacious...there is more than enough room for the event.  If the weather is bad, the place isn't weatherproof, so it can get chilly.  I don't know how it is during the hot season.  It's easy to maneuver inside; outside, there is plenty of parking and easy entry and exit.  The restrooms are only outside, but seemed to have plenty capacity and relatively clean.  The food vendors were also only outside, and had not that many items, but enough things for both omnivores and vegetarians alike.

I've been to Pan Asian, one of the few Chinese/Japanese/Thai(?) places nearby.  I was looking to see how this place compared.  So, a couple quick pluses noted right away: it was smaller and more intimate, and while there were a few TVs mounted on the walls, I didn't hear them.  I could hear Asian music.  That was good--I was in a mood for quiet.  But as I waited this Sunday night to be seated, several minutes went by and no one greeted me.  And they weren't that crowded.  Finally a young man came over to seat me.  He didn't smile, barely made eye contact, and seemed more interested in watching the TV than in seating me.  And it wasn't like it was the World Series on!  So I'm seated at a quiet booth and get dinner and drink menus.  The waitress comes shortly to take my drink order.  Very nice.  No beer on tap though--only bottles.  I head to the restroom and get assailed by a smell that smells like it was backed up to a sewer pipe. And all they have is a little air freshener device.  I don't think it's going to do it, folks.  I go back and select everything off the Japanese menu.  I order miso soup.  There a wide variety of traditional sushi rolls and some "nouveau" stuff, like the cream cheese in rolls and so forth.  I ordered a few different rolls.  The miso soup was good, with plenty of big pieces of nori.  The various rolls were well-wrapped.  Tasty, nothing particularly artistic about them.  The most interesting was one with mango on top with some sauce, that was very colorful and flavorful.  The server came around a couple times to see how things were.  So--Pan Asian may be a bit more noisy and big, but it's classier and seems cleaner and the waitstaff are more pleasant.  Seeing as they're both near each other, I'd go back there, not here

There aren't many places to eat where I live in Laveen, though there are two Mexican eateries, and now three close to each other (not counting Taco Bell).    I was in the mood for a quick Mexican meal, so I went here, where I had gone months before, and remembered getting a cheese quesadilla with beans and rice on the side which I remembered being good.   So today I returned, just requesting a cheese quesadilla.  And a side of fries, since I noticed they had them.  The quesadilla was soon ready, and they waited till the fries were done to summon me to pick up my order from the counter.   The quesadilla was sliced in several non-triangular pieces, with apparently jack cheese oozing uncontrollably from inside its soft shell.  As I ate it, it seemed to just become a congealed mess, with the soft shell not even crisped much.   The fries were plenty hot and tasty, and I wound up eating all of those and leaving more of the quesadilla behind.  So--how can you screw up a quesadilla?!?!  I mean, it's pretty basic.  I suggest trying out the other Mexican restaurants if you are local--even if it means waiting a little longer.  Life is too short to eat bad food!

Really--don't bother.  With all the other Mexican restaurants nearby, don't waste your time here.  Unless you just are in a rush for cheap eats with a half a dozen kids in tow.  But still, there are so many other options nearby.  I went here as I had a gift card.  I asked for veggie quesadilla.  The sign said it came with "extra beans and rice".  The girl at the serving line asked if I wanted the rice and beans in the quesa.  I said "on the side."  She said that the next people on the line would take care of it.  I had a choice of other things to go with it.  I said lettuce and guac.  They didn't mention rice and beans.  I waited 5 minutes for the cashier to show up and cash me out.  F-cking food was growing cold as I waited.  Finally I got my drink cup from her and cashed out.  Gift card paid for most of my meal.  I got a mint limeade for a drink. Turned out to be the best part of the meal.  I ate the quesadilla...fairly flavorless except for the hot sauce I added.  The lettuce on the side looked tired.  Guac was just ok...not much flavor there either.  Then I remembered I never got any rice or beans.  By then, I just didn't care.  I finished my quesa and bolted.  I swear, you can get a better meal at Chipotle's.

Just got a couple of things here that were not pizza, but impressed so far.  This is one of those pizza joints which is comfortable enough to actually sit and eat, as opposed to some others which are really set up as to-go or delivery places.  Plenty of tables and booths for families or groups.   I got fried mozzarella and eggplant parm sandwich.  The fried mozzarella seemed "homemade", as they weren't all uniform logs, the breading was flavorful and a bit flaky, and the mozzarella nice and hot and gooey, all served with a flavorful marinara sauce.  The eggplant parm sandwich was on a perfectly heated and slightly crisped Italian bread with flavorful breaded eggplant, plenty of gooey mozzarella cheese, and marinara sauce, served with a little extra sauce on the side.  The sandwich was delish, definately filling enough on its own.    They have a nice selection of soda soft drinks plus iced teas.  The waitstaff was very pleasant.  I can't wait to come back and try their pizza!

I said I would go back for the pizza and I did...and I'm glad.  I ordered 2 pizzas to go, both medium, a side salad, and an order of mini cannolis.  I was told it would be ready in 45 minutes and the pizzas were ready when I got there, although it looked like they had to put together the rest of the order after that.  They threw in a complimentary order of garlic knots with marinara sauce with the salad, which I really appreciated.  The "medium" pizzas were quite big, as was each slice.  The red pizza had big pieces of fresh broccoli, black olives, and fresh mushrooms.  Very tasty, lots of gooey mozzarella cheese, but it wasn't pure white, so probably not the real "high end" stuff.  The crust was good, and I appreciated it wasn't soggy, nor was it when reheated the next day.  The garlic knots were very flavorful and the dipping sauce had a strong tomatoey flavor.    The white pizza came with mozzarella and ricotta cheese, and was ordered with bacon, spinach, and garlic.  All were delicious, and the garlic was in slices, big enough to see, not like little minced up pieces from most places.  The side salad had plenty of fresh greens, shredded carrots, some red onion pieces and a few black olive slices and cucumbers.  It was flavorful.  Finally, the cannolis were crisp and drizzled with chocolate sauce, with the filling having a slight coconut flavor.  I would definitely rank this pizzeria as one of the best in the area....now if only they delivered!

Only been here once for lunch but very impressed.  Walking into the courtyard there is lots of comfy seating and pillows.  Inside, there are more loveseats and pillows, navy decor and dark tables, adding an instant air of intimacy, warmth, and relaxation to the place.  I was having a business lunch on a Friday afternoon.  It wasn't super-busy, and we were seated at a nice table near the street indoors.    I was impressed with the good variety in the menu, from salads to burgers, pasta, seafood and more.  I came across a different kind of listing: crepes, and decided to try their seafood one.   Two crepes came with lobster, scallops, some chopped tomatoes, white sauce, and I believe chives, along with green beans on the side.  It was very tasty, the crepes were great, and the fish tasted good.  Coming from the Northeast, I know good fish!  Service was fast, friendly, and efficient.  I definitely will go back here!

In the search for great breakfast places, especially ones that serve it all day, this place just went to number ONE on the charts!   The service here is great, friendly, efficient, and fun with the bear-oriented t-shirts and paw-prints on their suspenders.  A lot of paw-themed stuff....from the dishes to napkins and stuff on the walls.  OK, now to the food.  As others have said, portions were quite generous.  Sometimes bigger is not better--but here everything was great.   I ordered fresh squeezed orange juice.  The large size was really LARGE.  Was it really fresh-squeezed?   I saw a Minute Maid machine near the kitchen, so I don't know, but it tasted fresh squeezed!  ordered the California Omelete with home fries and biscuit.  When it came out, I was amazed--the biscuit was the size of my fist!   But it was delicious, and moist enough to even eat plain.  The omelet came with jack cheese and fresh sliced mushrooms inside, with a couple of slices of avocado on top.  It looked and tasted great!    The home fries were outstanding.  Many places serve up potatoes fairly plain.  These were red potatoes well-seasoned with salt and pepper plus pieces of green and red pepper.  Very flavorful and great looking.  My wife got their blueberry pancakes. I had a taste--they were flavorful, fluffy, and had a nice vanilla taste to them.  The ham stake accompanying it was a nice big slab and plenty thick.  This place is great for brunch, as you will surely be well-satisfied for several hours!  The rest of the menu looks good for dinner and lunch--plenty of comfort food with creativity and flavor!

Love Black Bear Diner!  I haven't found a location I haven't enjoyed!  The food is plentiful and delicious, and the waitstaff are friendly and fairly quick, even when crowded.  Breakfast is delish all the time, with their tasty pancakes, large, fluffy biscuits, and a nice selection of omelettes.   So tonight I went with my wife for dinner for a change: she wanted breakfast, while I was going for the dinner menu.  It's  a good time to go, as they are far less busy than for breakfast or brunch.  Looking for something lighter, I ordered the Pecan-encrusted trout, which comes with veggies and fruit.  I also got a side salad.  Of everything, the trout was the star.  Nice and moist, with a light coating of pecan and other flavors, it was perfectly cooked.  Not surprisingly, we found out at checkout that it is brought in from another supplier--they don't make it in house.  Regardless, it is definitely worth getting, and the manager (?) said it is one of their most popular dishes.  I'm assuming he means for dinner.  If there is one downside to Black Bear, it is that it is so popular that there can be a big wait to get a table in the morning, especially on weekends.  So be prepared...

I think I've found my new go-to sushi place.  It's little more than 5 minutes from my house, which helps.  The prices are good: my wife and I were planning to do the all you can eat but it turned out with their discounted sushi/sushi roll prices, we didn't have to do the AYCE.  But it was close, when you tallied it all up.  Selection is very good for their special rolls and regular sushi.  The service was very efficient and friendly.  Sushi was quite tasty, and the rice tender.  Green tea moshi ice cream ball is good for dessert.  We will return!

Did come back as I promised!  This time earlier in the day, and after doing the math, the wifey and I figured it was worth doing the AYCE.  They do have some rules: no taking home leftovers from AYCE, and you aren't supposed to share with other member you are with if they aren't also doing AYCE.  Well, it was a good thing we both did it, because my wife ordered too much and I had to help her eat some!    I started off with the shumai (shrimp dumplings)...very good with the dipping sauce.  I also had veggie spring rolls.  The filling was good, but outside was a bit oily.    All the other rolls were good. I found something interesting in the sushi pieces: the rice actually had a touch of wasabi on it, the way it's supposed to be done, but few places actually do it.  Listen to the waitresses' advice: order just a few pieces at a time (or rolls), otherwise, it is easy to order too much and then not be able to finish it all.  Note that, when you aren't that hungry, the regular "half price" menu is usually the better deal.

Coming out of a later movie in Glendale the other night, we decided to look for a place to eat nearby.  Whipped out the smartphone, set the setting to YELP, and the tractor beam locked onto Grimaldi's nearby.  Off we went at warp speed.  At the time of arrival, which was later dinnertime, there was no wait.  We got a table and had to hop up on the chairs to sit there.  Looking around, I enjoyed the whimsy of the decor, with what appeared as wine bottles with their bottoms cut off as hanging lights, different NYC Subway signs, some b&w classic NYC scenes, and the cooks nearby, twirling the pizza dough.  The menu is clearly focused on the pies, with basically just a few appetizers and salads for other items.  We ordered a Caesar salad to start.  The plate and salad were nice and chilled, with the dressing having a slight lemon taste; it was light, not a hearty Caesar dressing, but enjoyable.  The presentation of the pizza is as they should be: a stand to give it the respect it deserves, and served on a platter with a serving utensil (unlike many places that just expect you to use your own fork or knife--barbarians!)  Ours was a large, thin crust cheese pizza with fresh tomatoes and kalamata olives.  The tomatoes were perfectly cut and distributed--it looked like a pepperoni pizza.  The olives stood out, very nice flavor with a salty kick--these were the good ones and not overcooked!  Although I did order a pie with sauce, I didn't really notice it...maybe they didn't use much.  I hope to return and try that again.  Though there was plenty to fill us up and take a few pieces home, we decided to save room for dessert and ordered the tiramisu, which is always interesting to see how each place interprets it.  We found they don't make their own (though they do make their own cheesecakes), but it was excellent: very moist and flavorful.  Our service was great: the waitress came over several times to see how we were doing and someone else came by towards the end to see if we had a good experience.  Of course, it also wasn't the rush hour, so that helped.  I hope to make it back to this or another of their locations, as it has great thin crust pizza WITHOUT a huge wait.  Beam me back, Scotty!

This area isn't my neck of the woods....was coming out of a play nearby and was STARVING for something to eat.  Checked Yelp and found a few places, but the wife and I love Italian, so here we come.  Plus just a few minutes from the play.  Place looks nice from the outside, several vehicles parked outside on a Sunday afternoon, so it was a good sign.  Friendly greeting at the door and promptly seated.  The decor wasn't very complex, but it looked fresh, inviting...so we took our seats.  We reviewed the menus.  Nice solid classic Italian food, nothing fancy.  We ordered the salad with the arugula, cherry tomatoes, and gorgonzola to split.  Plenty to split.  The salad was nice and fresh.  A nice "breadbasket" was comprised of something like cut up pizza crusts from their wood-burning oven brushed with olive oil, herbs, and maybe a touch of garlic.  Yum.  A few minutes later, dropped in that bowl are some garlic knots, hot and fresh out of the oven.  YUMM!  We gobble up all and ask for more.  C'mon, it's too good!  After we finish the salad, the entrees arrive right on time.  The wifey gets veal piccata, which she says is very good.  I got mussels in marinara sauce.  We both substituted mixed veggies for pasta.  The veggies were carrots, broccoli, and summer squash lightly boiled so as to leave them al dente.  Perfect!  Everything tasted delicious in the tasty marinara sauce, which I'm sure would be excellent on pizza.  I only thought the mussels could have been cooked possibly so as to leave them a little more tender.  But they definitely tasted fresh.  For dessert, we split a house-made tiramisu.  This was the real deal, with good flavors of rum, coffee, cocoa dusted on top, and constructed with lady fingers.    Our waitress was friendly, checked on us just the right amount, and came with the check in good time.  Unfortunately, we don't live near here, so it's not too likely we'll return soon, but I highly recommend it to anyone in the area.  This is excellent classic Italian food served right.

Luv dis place!  The sunny smiles greet you by the friendly staff as soon as you come in.  Recon the restaurant, and it looks like a retro soda shop (which is definitely part of the vibe).  Their steakburgers are cooked fresh, a bit of crispness on the edge, nice and moist.  Dogs are good.  Fries are thin and not full of flavor...but that's what their "fry sauce" is for the dipping.  Their fried pickles are just ok....Short Leash Hot Dogs makes a bigger and more flavorful one...these are small and not as flavorful.  Good with the ranch dipping sauce.  Luv their Turtle Sundae: custard with (usually) hot caramel and fudge sauce drizzled down it with nuts and whipped cream and cherry on top.  Heavenly!  Service is usually pretty quick, even when busy.  This is one of those places where you order at the counter and then pick up when they call you.  Place is kept clean, tables wiped down.  Come on down!

This place rocks and will be a new top Fave!  The delish food, the cheerful, knowledgeable waitstaff, drinks, and even the music (any place playing The Doors, Led Zeppelin, and the song "Relax" has my vote) was great.  Had the Blood Orange martini, Ahi Bowl, and the Sweet Potato fries.  We shared the ceviche, poke, and the calamari.  My wife also had the Mai Tai, which I tasted.  It was refreshing and not too boozy tasting, yet had plenty alcohol.   And for dessert, a great Key Lime Pie.   On a Saturday night, the age range was very eclectic--some families even seemed to be there, yet it is a good place to take a date.   Will go back again!

While I've only been here once with some coworkers for Happy Hour, I think this place has a lot of good attributes to make it a place to come back to.  I liked the fact that it wasn't too loud to have a nice conversation during happy hour.  We ordered drinks and got the Hummus Trio, Babbaganoush, and some pita.  The first batch of pita was cold but nice and soft.  We quickly ate it up dipping it in the hummus and Babba.  The different types of hummus were very flavorful.  The happy hour prices on the appetizers were great but our server told us the servings were only enough for one person (so not really for sharing).  We asked for more pita and then got a few whole pitas which were warm.  When they cooled, however, they got hard...not very appetizing.    Servers were friendly and checked in with us often enough.   It wasn't too crowded when we were there (between 4 and 6 on Friday) but busy enough.  We didn't have too many other things to eat but the menu looked interesting--I definitely would like to come back.    One tip: there is a parking garage with free parking across the alley from this place.  It doesn't have a lot of spaces but probably is best for late afternoon to early evening.

This store is great!  First time here, and not far from my house.  Nice to see this chain has locations around the Valley.  I needed a few watch batteries replaced and installed, plus a reliable replacement battery for my cell (I didn't want to buy online because I've read too many scam stories).  I was pleasantly surprised when I went to their website and found that they also carried flourescent lighting tubes, which I just needed to get.  I was anticipating a haul over to Home Depot for those, but now I figured I could get everything here.  And, yes I did.  The person behind the counter was helpful and got me what I needed.  He said he wasn't able to replace the watch batteries (he did try to, on one), but gave me a business card of some other place that he said that could and was reasonable.  I got the new tubes, a battery for my cell with a lifetime warranty, and another battery.    The shop also has lots of lighting gadgets and charging devices for home, car, etc.  I will definitely be back!

Not a huge fan of pizza chain restaurant....usuallly they're a last resort.  But for Laveen, this is mostly just chain especially for delivery.  So I like Papa John's the best: you can build it just the way you want on their website and even order ahead  of  time and specifiy a time if early enough.. 2 of 3 drivers have been right on time and very nice, and the order was accurate.  The ingreadients tasted fresh and not dried out.  the crust was tasty. Would use again!

My wife told me about this place and said she loved the food, so after a recent appointment we were free on a weekday and went there for lunch--not during the lunch rush.  Not many people there so we had our choice of tables.  For appetizers, we had the Roquefort Flammenkuchen, which is like a tiny pizza with melted blue cheese, small pieces of pear, crushed walnuts, mozzarella and sour cream on top.  It easily could feed one person, but we split it.  While small, it was rich, and very tasty with the various flavors.  We also got their garlic bread, which was a piece of French bread sliced vertically (in other words, it's not like you get part of a loaf) toasted with garlic butter and cheese.  It was very good, but expected more of a serving.  For entrees, we both got crepes.  I got the Mediterranee, which has 4-5 big sea scallops, delicately cooked and served with a sauce with saffron and cheese.  It was very good.  While not big, the richness of the sauce helped make it more filling.  There is also a little salad served on the side of the plate.  My wife got the Nordique, which is a similar plate except it has smoked salmon with a cream and cheese sauce.  I tasted that--yum!  What is very interesting about these crepes is that they are square with the edges folded over and made of buckwheat, which makes them a bit heartier.    The dessert menu is very tempting with a variety of dessert crepes, but I felt we should do a fondue, so we got the chocolate fondue for 2.  The chocolate sauce is made from melted bittersweet chocolate mixed with whipping cream and kept gently heated.  There are little brownies, sliced strawberries, apples, and cream puffs to dip.  It was literally finger-licking good!  Nice touch: as the designated driver, I got a root beer, and was given a free refill without me asking.  My wife got a glass of wine from an extensive wine and beer list.  The waitress was very friendly, helpful, and gave us great service.  This place also has a comedy night and musical entertainment certain nights, too.  This is quite a gem...I will definitely be back.  One small nit: as some others have written, it can be quite expensive, especially with drinks and desserts.

3 stars for the place, 2 stars for the food. Been to a few different fro-yo places in the Valley, and this one seemed kind of similar in look: very clean and bright inside with light green color and tasting cups.  Main downside: the selection of flavors was unexciting.  Most places have at least a few that I really like.  Here, none really stood out.  I got the Red Velvet Cake at last (and not very much of it, at that).  The spoons have a little character with a animal figure on top, they have free water in a dispenser with cups, and they actually have restrooms, which other places don't have.  This place isn't near me, but I wouldn't go back even if it were.  Not recommended.

Living in the West Valley, I've been missing my Indian Food fix.  Finally moving to Gilbert, I now am near a few good Indian restaurants with buffets.  Of those I've tried, Indian Oven is one that I really like the most.  I have only gone to the lunch buffet.  The price is great for all you can eat of this delicious food.  I like the unlimited Mango Lassi and the hot garlicky Naan brought around as much as you like.    There is a good selection of the vegetarian and non-veg dishes.  I find the veg ones most tasty and interesting. One I really liked for texture and taste is Kadhi Pakora, which are fried veg pakoras (kinda crunchy) in a yellow curry.  Yummm!  They also have different saag dishes, chopped spicy salad.  The condiments taste homemade, unlike some other places.  They have fresh fried potato slices covered in a batter...very flavorful.  That apparently was popular because it wasn't there the whole time.  Also a nice choice of 4 different types of warm and cold desserts.    The staff is very pleasant and took my plates and refilled my water as needed.    I found everything quite flavorful....one reviewer complained it was not spicy, but I like Indian food for the flavors, not needing hot spice.    Only one issue for me...the lunch buffet is only open till about 2, which isn't always convenient for me.  Some other places are open later.  There are a couple of TVs, but they were on mute while I was there so didn't bother me, and also weren't in my line of vision.  Great place to eat, I'll be back again!

Others have reviewed La-Z-Boy showrooms and given product reviews.  This isn't about the product, but the showroom and service I got there.  I entered the showroom and was impressed by a variety of furniture pieces near the entryway.  There was a sign that said "no pressure zone."  I had come for a specific thing, a new recliner to replace my old one, so I knew what I wanted.  As I made my way a little deeper into the store to see where the recliners were (as some were scattered amongst the other furniture), a saleswoman, Linda, greeted me very pleasantly.  I told her what I wanted and she proceeded to take me to the recliner area.  She suggested different chairs based on what I said I liked and how she saw I fit into different chairs.  I found her very helpful and knowledgeable about the product and fabrics and options available.  A few times she let me just sit back for awhile in certain chairs and went to check on other customers.  She also offered me a bottle of water.  Eventually, after I had decided on which chair I liked the most, I went to find her and she came and checked on availability of the chair and fabric.  It wound up needing to be custom ordered, which she took care of.  Overall, I was very pleased with my experience with the salesperson (the other ones seemed pleasant, too), the bright and spacious layout of the showroom, and nice selection of not only recliners but other furniture and accessories for your home.  I would definitely recommend it.  I also think the value is good.

We were invited by friends who have come here frequently to try the place.  No need to rehash the concept: other reviewers have done that well.  Our experiences: We ordered soup, salad and appetizer.  The soup came out before the appetizer.  The server made like this was intentional but I think he or the kitchen messed up.  Not that it was a big deal, just disconcerting.  I had the Oxtail Consomme.  It was pretty watery with traces of beef flavor and some vegetables floating in it and some trace of fat from the beef. I didn't finish it...not that exciting.  My wife and I love calamari, so we ordered the Crispy Calamari and Octopus Carpaccio.  Imagine our surprise when the plate arrived with 4 little calamari, paper thin octopus, and a shot glass of ceviche.  While all were very tasty, it was not very filling, to say the least.  No wonder we kept asking for more bread!  I will say, as another reviewer did, that everything was presented nicely with decoration, definitely done with care.    Desserts were presented ahead of time, and all were good.  Crepes Suzette were finished tableside.  Then a small dessert sampler was also presented to the table after the check was delivered.  So, the verdict: * Service - Good.   Strong effort, friendly, and mostly good execution * Ambience - Very good.  Relatively quiet, cozy * Food presentation - Excellent * Food taste - Overall very good * Value - While you get what you pay for, you will leave hungry unless a) you have a tiny tummy, or b) you drink lots of water with your meal (I did that and still wasn't full), or c) have lots of bread  I'd go back with friends, but not too often, as I need my dining out dollar to go far.

If you need body work, this is the place to go! Unfortunately, I have had to take my car for body work several times in life, both in other states and here in the Valley.  I have never had an experience as impressive as this: 1) The owner, Luis Gonzalez (LG), personally drove to my place of work and checked out what needed to be done.   2) LG helped coordinate my rental car (which insurance covered) so there was no time without a car. 3) LG took my car and drove it to his shop, so I did not have to take time out from work to go there. 4) When the car was ready, my car was returned, looking good as new, to where I work.  The interior was clean and vacuumed, with paper floormats having protected the floor from dirt, and the exterior was totally clean; the windows were all cleaned inside and out.  5) LG then drove my rental back to the agency, saving me from having to return it and lose more time. 6) Best of all, he saved me money, so my out of pocket expense was lower than my deductible!  Where else can you get this kind of service?   I recommend any of his locations.  He is also rated A+ by the Better Business Bureau.

Had an "emergency" during one of the worst times of the year for it: 4th of July weekend.  My shower wouldn't turn off and I had to shut off the water to the house.  Not very good in hot Phoenix.  So I called a few plumbers who advertised 24/7 emergency service.  No one could come out same day.  Finally got Plumbing Medic.  I was told I could probably have a plumber come out within an hour.  I said, "Let's do it" and all my info was taken.  I was told there would be a $99 emergency service fee.    Kevin came out in about 40 minutes.  He thought I'd need a whole new cartridge, which would have been over $400.  But when he opened things up, he found it was just a busted plastic faucet cover, which is a $13 part.  He didn't have any on hand, but told me I could pick one up at Home Depot.  And he closed the shower faucet so I could turn on the house water.   Total cost was $99.  I appreciated the quick response and honesty.  Definitely would recommend.

When I called Barefoot to ask questions and schedule an appointment, no one answered so I left a message.  Later in the day, after business hours, a very apologetic Shantell called to say she hadn't been able to return my call till then due to a family emergency.  That's one of the downsides of being a small operation.  But I won't ding them for that.  I appreciate the professionalism and responsibility shown.  Shantell took from me all the information on what I wanted done, and patiently answered all my questions.  She then broke down the costs per item and gave me the grand total, giving me a small coupon discount.  I thought it was very reasonable, and I appreciated that unlike some services which advertise a low price but upsell all kinds of add ons till it's a lot more expensive, the price she quoted me was the price I paid.  Justin called ahead to say he was coming and arrived a little early.  I had cleared stuff off the furniture and carpets so he didn't have to do much prep.  He was pretty quiet and quick and was done in under 2 hours.  Everything looked good and with the a/c and ceiling fans going, things were drying.  I had carpets in 3 rooms plus 2 area rugs, a sofa and loveseat done.  The fact that everything was organic was a nice touch.  There was no smell.  I would definitely use this company again.

I have to thank Church's Chicken for finding this restaurant.  I went to the plaza on 35th Ave., next to WalMart, in the mood for some fish and chips, which Church's just introduced.  As I got out of my car, I saw the banner for DJ's Fish and Chips, and thought, "why not try one of the local restaurants?"  I was pleased with my decision.  As I walked in, I found myself in a sparse, spacious room with small tables with cushioned chairs around the place.  I was greeted by a woman with a big smile at the ordering counter.  The range of food is small, and might be considered BBQ: fried or grilled fish (reading the online reviews, I gather it's catfish), different kinds of BBQ, and a few sides, such as coleslaw, collard greens, fries, and mac n' cheese.  I went for the fried fish, fries, and coleslaw, paid, and waited for my order at my table to eat there.  There is not much to look at on the walls--just one large TV kinda loud and a smaller TV with no sound on to keep you occupied, plus a stand for New Times--always a good standby.  There was a chess table in the corner with pieces on it which had a sign saying "Do not touch", and a few rough-hewn wooden boards with hand drawn or painted sports team logos on them.  When my order finally came it was quite generous.  Several large pieces of fish, lightly breaded, were piled on top of each other, with the fries on the sides and bottom, and a slice of Texas bread cut in half at the bottom.  The fish really melted in my mouth: the breading was flavorful but not overdone, just a bit salty (but I've been cutting down on salt, so it may have seemed moreso to me).  The fish and the fries were not greasy at all.  The fries were nice and crispy.  The cole slaw was well-balanced, without too much mayo or sweetness--just right. The woman from the front checked with me a few times to see how everything was.  Service with a smile.  She told me they'd only been open since June of last year.  Check them out at www.djsfishandchips.com and support your local business!   I know I will again!

To celebrate Valentine's Day, I got a Groupon for a couples massage and pedicure for 2 here.  To make a long story short, we wound up actually using this deal in March.  When we got to Plush, we were greeted right away by the friendly receptionist, and after a brief wait, introduced to our massage therapists.  We went to the massage room, where two massage tables were placed close together.  There wasn't a lot of extra space for the masseuses to work, but as we would find out, they had enough room.  Before the massage, one of the therapists asked if we had any medical issues or places to concentrate on, and offered upgrades to the standard Swedish massage that came with the deal.  My wife got an upgrade to a therapeutic massage, which was supposed to be deeper.  After the therapist left, we prepared for the massage and got under the sheets on each table.  Everything was very comfortable, and the two gals came back, turned on relaxing music, turned down the lights, and went to work.  Although my massage was not supposed to be deep, I could feel her really kneading the muscles--no need for anything deeper for me!  When I turned over on my back, she placed a cloth over my eye to keep the light out, which I thought was a nice touch.  Throughout, I was always well covered by the sheet, only the parts being worked on being exposed.  After we were done, we were met by the gals who gave us cups of water and told to drink a lot.  I enjoyed the massage...it wasn't so gentle that you could fall asleep, but a good way to loosen up all the muscles.  Next we got our pedicures.  For my wife, she got to pick out a nail polish color.  Men just get their nails buffed....unless they want polish.  You sit in the cushy chair that reclines and has the massaging motion built in that you can control, while getting your feet bathed in a little hot jacuzzi of sorts.  After you sit for a bit, the nail gal files and shapes the nails, clipping if necessary, cleaning up the cuticles, and applying lotion and filing down any calluses on the skin.  After all is done, I was left with smooth feet and nails.    I thought everyone did a great job, and was friendly.  The overall place was spacious and clean.    I would recommend this place.  Also, if you go, don't forget to tip, just like a restaurant.  They appreciate customers who show they appreciate a job well done.

I took my wife here for Valentine's Day as it was listed somewhere as being one of the most romantic restaurants in Scottsdale (I think all the Phoenix romantic restaurants were already booked).  So my impressions of its looks: indoors, the flocked wallpaper, crystal chandliers, many ornate mirrors, all lend a quaint, old time charm.  (Our waitress was sure to tell us that it is the second oldest house in Scottsdale, although it has been renovated).  But the ceilings are exposed with metal struts, and the music goes along with it to lend an urban vibe.  To me, it was inconsistent, trying to please everyone but a bit bizarre.  So, okay, I didn't stare at the ceiling.  Our waitress was great.  She was dressed in classy black, not the usual waitress garb, and definitely seemed to know about the different wines and the dishes that were available.  That spoke to some good experience at this place, which seems rare to find these days.    The menu had plenty of choices, and let me say this right now, you really need to pick multiple courses in order to not leave hungry, as the portions are small.  This is one of those special occassion places where you get looks over portion sizes.  Where the price of the course is inversely related to the amount you get.    We started with a complimentary amuse bouche, with some cheese baked into a pastry coating I think.  I considered getting the caviar special, but when I later found out the price ($80 for an ounce), I decided on something else.  I got a "smoked burrata", which was supposed to be a mozzarrella cheese on the outside, riccotta on the inside, and some other stuff served with toast points.  What I got was a mound of white cheesy stuff which had no discernable flavor at all.  It came with pomegranate seeds, caramelized pearl onions, and non-descript white french bread smeared with some kind of fruity thing.  Not toasted.  This dish was a flop, in my opinion.  My wife got the foie gras.  She had to ask twice to get the advertised toast to put it on.  Finally she got some hearty, raisin-filled toast with which to put the foie on.  I tasted the toast and it was good.  If they had used that toast on my dish, it would have been passable.  I'm not a fan of foie based on the animal cruelty issues brought up, but the wifey wanted it.  We shared the lobster bisque.  Again, a small bowl, where it comes with lobster pieces and some chopped veggies in the bowl, and they pour in the soup.  And unlike many bisques, this was fairly liquidy, not rich and creamy, so no waistline worries there. It was quite tasty.  A nice feature is that all of their wines are available by the glass, so no need to pony up for a whole bottle because you want to try something only available that way.  For the main course I got the snapper.  A nice piece, very well cooked.  It came with a mild red sauce, a couple of tiny potatoes cut in half and chopped haricot verts.  I ordered a side of roasted cauliflower for the table which was very good, coming with browned butter, parmesan, and other flavors.  The wifey order the special, a strip steak which came with a dollop of mashed potatoes.  But there was enough steak left over to take home.  For dessert, we ordered a variation of their special, which was a chocolate cake with Kahlua, peppermint cotton candy on top, with a chocolate espresso sauce surrounding it.  We got some honey lavendar ice cream on the side, which was delicious.  Our waitress check on us just the right amount; our water was frequently refilled, and food was brought out and plates removed with excellent timing.   With the exception of the appetizer mentioned, I'd say all the food was delicious and well-prepared and presented, with excellent service.  I do think it is a bit pricey for what you get, so even factoring everything in, I'd say the value isn't the best.  If you're in the mood to splurge and you're looking to eat in Old Town Scottsdale, then consider this place to go.

I've been here a few times and really like this place.  In a sea of downtown bars full of TV sets and burgers, this is a nice island of relative tranquility.  Now at wintertime, you can look outside the window and see the skaters in CitySkate.  While there may be a TV at the bar, I don't see or hear it at any other table, and see nothing but their funky murals or other patrons enjoying a skillfully made meal.  I've generally just ordered sushi, which is presented without adornment on shiny white porcelain of different shapes.  Everything tastes nice and fresh, the nori is nice and crispy, and they are inventive with different combinations of house rolls.  Just don't expect to be in and out of here fast.  You generally can expect an hour's stay, even on a not-too-busy day.  But that's ok, good sushi should be savored, with the eyes and the mouth.    I once got green tea ice cream for dessert, and the serving was very generous...enough for 3 people.  The service is always friendly and professional.  Expect to pay a bit of money.  This is fresh fish in the desert, not a McDonald's hamburger.  Set your expectations accordingly and you won't be disappointed.

Ok, I admit I was skeptical when someone from the office suggested going here for lunch.  Just hot dogs, I asked?  But I'm a foodie, so I figured I'd try it.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I never saw so many exotic combos of dogs...not only toppings for them, but what was INSIDE them!  I wound up going for the more healthy turkey dog, with simply kraut and ketchup.  Wow, even that was great.  It was served on warm pita --genius---that was less bun to impede the flavor of the dog!  The dog was crispy on the outside and delish on the inside.  I got it with a little side salad, which is the option if you don't get their chips.  I also tasted their chips...quite good also.  The waitstaff were very helpful and explained all the different choices.  And if you have a sweet tooth, they offer their own doughnuts.  There is also a good selection of bottled drinks to accompany your dog.  If you like dogs or brats, you owe it to yourself to check this placed out!

A friend wanted to try this place, being that it's local and they have a doo-wap group performing...at least this Saturday.  We had brushetta and garlic knots for the table.  The brushetta had plenty of fresh tomatoes and basil, among other things.  The garlic knots had minced garlic butter...more flavorful than garlic butter with powder.  The margherita pizza was very flavorful...it had chopped tomatoes and a crust crispy and NY-style...thinner, but not too thin.  And the musical group was really fun, but does not allow for good conversation if you're sitting nearby.  The waitstaff was good natured and stopped by enough to check up on us, refill drinks, despite being a busy night.  Recommended.

Went with a meetup group to this place.  It's so small, only a local would notice it.  I'm really glad I went.  While it seems to take forever to get meals, it seems because they really put a lot of care into the cooking and presentation of the meal.  For a little place, they don't just throw the food on a plate, but present it with rice molded in pyramids or hemispheres; appetizers can be multilayered in cylinders...all colorful and super flavorful.  But a number of the dishes do rely heavily on rice.  The one I had, which was basically rice with brown sauce and mushrooms and beans with a few other veggies, had the unique taste that the rice seemed crispy on top, like it had been run through the broiler.  I think it is these touches that may help take time to get the food.  But the waitstaff is friendly and was more than willing to make suggestions to those at our table that knew nothing of the cuisine.    Try the non-alc Peruvian drink...it is delicious, with a nice taste of cloves.  I like the unique flavors and generous portions and very reasonable prices.  Just don't expect to be in and out.  Good place to come with others to pass the time and chat.  I'm putting down "NOT good for kids"...because I don't think they'd have the patience.

This review is not just about the food, service, and decor, but the package deal with free music most nights.  I've been here several times and am very impressed with the fresh, updated look from the previous Greek restaurant.  The food is very good, the servers very friendly and efficient.  When I have gone on a night when a band was playing, they seemed to have enough staff to handle taking and delivering orders very well, and the kitchen wasn't overwhelmed.  Also, their pita stays nice and soft, unlike that well-known pita place whose pita dries out hard within 30 minutes.  They have some super bands: jazz, blues, and a mix of others.  It is amazing considering some of them command decent admission costs at other venues and sell out to hundreds.  So the way I look at it, if any of the food seems a little pricey, (and I don't, since you get a lot for your money), then consider it partially for the price of the entertainment, if they are playing while you are there.

Great food, fun and quick service. It's got a bit of a hip and sometimes hippie vibe. Like a NYC coffeehouse. A bit pricey, but that's Downtown. Plus food is all fresh and to order.

This is officially the best doughnut place ever.  The crispy outside, cakey inside, and warm doughnut is absolutely incredible.  The toppings are plentiful....I had one with cherry and chocolate, and my hands were covered with the delicious gooey chocolate....finger-licking good.  If you are in the vicinity, don't deny yourself this piece of gastro-heaven!

We went yesterday, not their "grand opening" yet but things were operating smoothly.  Too bad some other reviewers felt the need to diss this place...when we went, all ice cream flavors were listed on a menu and on little placards near the ice cream itself, garbage can was available, and seating was as much as feasible inside and out without creating a mob scene.  And no one was "touching themselves."  Geez, sounds tittilating.  So, on to the ice cream. The friendly gal helping us happily let us taste all the different flavors we wanted to.  Then made a waffle bowl for my wife.  I got a waffle cone with two flavors.  The pecan praline was quite good.  I also had a standard...mint chocolate chip.  Yeah, I wouldn't say any of their flavors were real exotic, but maybe that's not what people want.  OK, people? Maybe the basics sell best.  And maybe they'll experiment and rotate in some different ones.  My waffle cone dripped though the bottom.  So what?  Am I gonna fault them for it?  Fuhgeddaboutit!  Ice cream drips, capisce?    All in all, all staff were fun and friendly, service was quick (there was no big line when we went on a Saturday night), and the place was clean and bright.  It's a perfect place to get hard ice cream in downtown Gilbert....especially if your tastebuds are singing from some of the spicy food from some of the neighboring eateries.   BTW, they said they'll have more offerings at their grand opening.    I'll be back.  I suggest you do, too.
