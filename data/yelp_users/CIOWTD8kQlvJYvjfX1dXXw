Was recommended this place for work on my '75 bus and was extremely satisfied.  They are very experienced, knowledgeable, and reasonable.  They answered a ton of questions I had and were genuinely honest.  I felt very comfortable immediately.  Super friendly and flexible as well.  They arranged for me to drop off on a Saturday outside of business hours and let me keep my bus there for a week while I was out of town.  I'd highly recommend to anyone and everyone.

Voicemail message and online hours show open on Sunday from 12-4p.  Drove down and definitely are closed on Sundays.  Won't be back.

Really like the atmosphere and food here.  High quality food and drinks at reasonable prices.  Love sitting in the bar area and enjoying the setting.  The bartenders are very friendly and management seems to be highly interested in ensuring our visit was perfect all around.  And best loaded baked potato around!  Definitely a fan!

Had my 1975 VW bus seats redone and was really impressed.  They were super helpful and confident in their work.  Very high quality and thorough job.  Seats look brand new!!  I'd recommend anyone to this shop.

DO NOT even try this garbage business.  Dropped my car off for the works wash and they didn't touch the inside at all.  When I let them know, they took no accountability and just said "oh" in response.  Left the car there and got back the 2nd time with the mats all over the seats and still no interior cleaning.  Unbelievable!

We go to Line Thai often and love the food.  They have the best soups and curries.  This is one of our favorite thai food spots in Phoenix.  It's cheap and high quality.  Judging from the outside, wouldn't really necessarily grab my attention but is worth checking out for some good spicy comfort food.  I have been referred here by a few people separately and decided to try - definitely worth it.  And the wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  Feels a little like family when you're there.   Highly recommend!

Love the modern spin on the indian food.  High quality food and always good service.  Really good naan and dishes that will satisfy everyone.  Lunch is the best value because dinner is ala carte style so dishes don't come with naan, rice, etc.  This is actually our favorite indian food spot in Phoenix.  Go here!

Excellent pho at a tremendous value.  Some of the best Vietnamese food in the Phoenix valley.  The service is great as well, the place is typically pretty busy and they work really hard to sit and serve everyone.  Highly recommend.

Fun atmosphere.  The food is simply not that great.  And expensive even for Vegas.  Would come back for the beer specials and live music but not for the food.

Really, really good food.  Went here for brunch, sat on the outdoor covered patio, and drank cheap mimosas!  I love the New Mexico style of food and great selection of seafood as well.  Good service.  Amazing place overall.

We love this pizza and wine bar.  Very, very good pizza with fresh quality toppings and homemade mozzarella.  Good wings and other appetizers.  Great selection of wine and beer.  All at a very inexpensive price unlike a lot of other wine bars.  The wait staff is always friendly and has good wine suggestions.  We like the patio seating and inside bar area.  Highly recommend this one!!!

We absolutely love everything about Crescent.  We've been about 5 times now and always looking to go back.  Intimate setting with patio and front restaurant/bar and full service bar in the venue portion.  Food is really good and inexpensive.  Shows are always really inexpensive with a close up experience and quality sound.  Love the quaintness and service.  Well run place and highly recommended!

This is good sushi and especially good for the west side of town.  Very fresh.  They have blue fin once a month at a great price which is hard to find at other sushi restaurants.  Sushi chefs are friendly and helpful.   Also great atmosphere for watching sports etc.  Definitely recommend as the alternatives in the area absolutely don't compare in food quality.

Had to try this place based on hype and really wanted to love it as it's close by and we love quality.  Unfortunately, the service killed the experience for us.  The place just didn't make us feel overly welcome and the pizza came out without the toppings we asked for.  The server offered it up on the side which took about 5 extra minutes which is fine but they then charged us separately for the addition.  When we asked to split the bill 3 ways at the end, the server took the tab back seemingly hastily.  Not a super friendly feel here.  The pizza was good but can get better for the high price.  No desire to return to this place.

This place is great.  Very friendly staff, super clean, modern, and comfortable.  They even offered free wine tasting for guests in the afternoon which was a great surprise.  And great location being right in the heart of Cityscape where there are good restaurants, bars, and nightlife.  Nice pool on the outside deck of the 3rd floor with full bar, lounge chairs, and outside games like ping pong and cornhole.  Also open to the public and can be accessed from the street as well.  Awesome hotel!!!

Wow, this place really impressed me.  Super delicious homemade enchiladas, tacos, and soup.  The tortillas are amazing, love the half corn half flour.  And the cornbread is the best ever!  Will be going here often.

Never have had anything like it.  Unique and  best ever.  The shaved ice is very light very similar to fresh snow powder so don't feel overly guilty when indulging for dessert.  The milk teas are awesome as well!  I love it and am addicted.

Okay, after going here a few times recently, we're obsessed.  Really, really good pho soups and spring rolls to die for.  Large size shareable portions.  Great atmosphere, friendly helpful people, outdoor patio seating, and good music.  If you like good comfort vietnamese food, try this one out.  If anyone knows the west valley, there isn't much and this is a hidden little gem.

Wow, really impressed! Decided to go after reading all of the positive reviews. The chicken shawarma was amazing topped off with the babaganoosh dip. YUM! Convenient, fast, friendly, and high quality.

Had a less than desirable experience so am not recommending this place, plenty of great restaurants around.  Ordered a simple omelet and came out missing most of the ingredients.  Not a big deal.  Took it back into the kitchen and sprinkled the missing cold cheese, cold mushrooms, and everything else that was missing.  Waitress said she personally looked inside the omelet after the cook said it was not missing anything and the same omelet came back out, YIKES!  When confronting the manager, he didn't seem to really care and just said "okay."  That is where the issue is, poor management.  Don't recommend.

Tried this place for the 1st time and loved it!  The neapolitan pizza is excellent and service is great.  We sat on the beautiful patio outside as the weather was nice, really enjoyable.  Some really good Italian wines and decent craft beer selection.  Oh, and loved the free homemade limoncello as a tasty after dinner treat, to die for!  Will be coming back!

Amazing little nook.  A huge variety of craft beers and wine with knowledgeable staff.  Play some classic board games, meet fun people, and drink good wine.  Definitely highly recommend this place.

This place is amazing.  Super high quality handcrafted drinks and top notch food combined with a great atmosphere.  Service is excellent and just love the overall feel.  We had the pot roast dumplings as an appetizer and they are to-die for.  Also have tried the wood grilled short rib dish, pork ramen, cauliflower ramen, and the wood fired grill plate.  Soooo good!  Can't go wrong here.  Will be back many times over.
