Yum! and more Yum!  We went for dinner and got really lucky that we didn't have to wait. The bruschetta is wonderful and they have a great wine selection.  Just thinking about how good everything was makes my mouth water and I want to go back.

I contacted them to replace the springs on my  leather couch. At first they seemed really helpful and interested in the work. I talked to the owner who was supposed to call me back to schedule when to come look at the couch and take it to their shop. That phone call never happened. I even called and left a message with the receptionist and he never called back. So the next day I called again and talked to him. He didn't care at all that he didn't call me back. He flatly told me that he was busy and that I was 1 of 20 people he needed to call or that had called him. Great that he is that busy but if he continues to disregard potential customers like he did me he won't be busy for much longer.

I was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews. Not a good first experience. First we had to wait 30 minutes for our food and got 5 different rolls to share.  There was so much mayo in the crab it left a coating in my mouth (YUK!)  The Phili roll was warm including the cream cheese.  The only good thing was the bartender.  I might go back to try the tepen grill but won't be getting sushi from here again.

Have dropped by here on the way to work a couple of times now.  Staff is super friendly and quick.  Bagels are soft and chewy. I am a super fan of the Nosh Veggie on sesame.  Hoping to have the time to get to sit and have breakfast their soon and try some of the yummy food I have seen.

Stay far far away from here unless you like food that comes out of a can into the microwave and onto your plate. I couldn't eat my meal at all, I had a chicken chimichanga that came out soggy there was so much water left in the chicken. I tried to eat the chicken but it was nasty and fatty. The rice and beans where hot on the outside and cold in the middle. Even the booth we where set at was dirty and had holes in the vinyl.  I will never go back.

The food has gone down hill. The pitas are soggy and so are the fries. I really liked this place and am disappointed in the changes.

They left dirt, hair and lint under the tint.  They gave me an appointment to take it back.  I took it back and they had it for 4 hours and still hadn't touched it. When my husband questioned the time the "manager" got mad threw a fit had the guys in the back remove the tint and gave a refund.    Bad experience all around.

For Casa Grande this place is fantastic!  The food isn't overly oily and the salsa is fresh and not so hot you can't eat it.  This is the only Mexican place in town I like to eat.

Great price and great service.  I has a bad experience with another florist in Casa Grande and ended up at Greens & Things.  They charged me $75 less than the other florist  was going to charge and made the exact arrangement I wanted.  I couldn't be happier and I will use this florist whenever I need flowers in Casa Grande.

Still 5 stars and still the best florist in CG. They make it so easy to order flowers and don't charge a fortune either.

I would have given it less but they did comp our bad meal. Ordered filet with crab stuffed prawns and the stuffing tasted like it had been left out. The manager (who never gave her name) tried to tell me that they where fine to eat. They really undercooked my husbands steak and desert was served in a very dirty bowl.  We went in because we had gift cards. I guess we will be giving it another try.

They made my wedding cake and it was amazing.  The decorators there are artists. The wedding cake was my first experience with them, sense then I have ordered a number of cakes for different occasions and never been let downs.  They are now making my sisters wedding cake. Also if you like pastry and bite sized sweets they are the place to go. Their cinnamon buns are the best I have ever had.

Things weren't great from the beginning. I was in a tight spot with a deadline and they had what I needed in stock but the price was really high.  It didn't take long for them to become dismissive, out right lie about order shipments and blow me off after the lie was found out. I placed an order on Monday told them it was time sensitive it was shipped ground  and not until Tuesday. I was also told that my whole order had shipped. One box came from Phoenix, one from California and half of the order was back ordered and that wasn't told me until 4 days after I placed my order. I would rather a company be honest and upfront about availability then lie to me. I will not use them again. I actually tried several times to find out what was going on and was only ever transferred to voice mails and never got a call back.

They saved my puppies!  I adopted two puppies from the pound and 4 days after getting them home they came down with parvo.  The vets and staff where fabulous!  They where super caring and honest with the possible outcome. They didn't get upset with my calling all the time and where very patient with me and wonderful with my puppies.  Thanks to their caring attention to detail my puppies and happy, healthy and parvo free.

Everyone at the Salt Cellar is AMAZING!!  The food is killer the service of the staff is impeccable and the owners really do care about their customers.  We had my Moms 50th birthday party there.  It wasn't a small group either, there where 22 of us, for any small restaurant like the Salt Cellar that is a really large party.  The staff was super attentive to all of us making sure my Mom was given extra special care.  Glasses never went dry and food came out quick, hot  and all  together!   I can't express how pleased I am with the wonderful service we received.

I would give it less if I could.  I have been here once before about 6 or 7 years ago.  At that time I thought I wouldn't be back, it was dirty and smelt weird and the food wasn't good.  Well a long time has passed and we went for a friends birthday.  We ordered apps and waited for a while for those. They where decent not great but decent.  Next comes the food.  The waiter sets the food in front of me and on my plate of chicken parm there is a plastic bag with pasta and sauce in it.  The bag is marked Sunday and it was Wednesday.  I looked at it, laughed a little to myself then pointed it out to the rest of the table.   We flagged down the waiter and showed him the plate. He took it back grumbled something and walked away with it.  Came back out 2 minutes later with the pasta dumped out of the bag onto my plate.  Being it was my friends birthday I didn't want to complain too much so I ate some of my chicken and didn't touch the pasta (in hind sight I shouldn't have eaten anything).  My husband wasn't happy with what happened and flagged down the waiter on my behalf to ask him how old the pasta was. We wanted to know if it was good until Sunday or was it made on Sunday and are now serving it on Wednesday. The waiter started talking about him being and pharmacy tech or something like that and didn't answer the question.  So my husband asked to talk to the manager.  The Manager comes back to the table about 15 minutes after we asked to talk to him and after everyone else is done eating.  He came up defensive and making excuses about company policy. They make pasta 2 times a week and portion it in little bags add sauce and microwave.  It isn't like I expect to have great fresh food at a place like Rainforest Cafe but pasta 4 days old? It isn't like it is hard to cook or takes a long time.  Needless to say I will never ever go to the restaurant again. I am glad what I did eat didn't make me sick.  After my experience I checked the board of health sight and it is scary!!  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=51696&business=RAINFOREST%20CAFE&address=5000%20%20%20ARIZONA%20MILLS%20CIR&permitid=SG31025    Think  twice before going to this place.

This was my first visit and from the experience I will be back many more times. I had the special seared scallops in a leak cream sauce, melt in your mouth goodness. My husband had a more classic dish and it was just as good as mine. We got the bruschetta to start and it was flavorful and the bread was nice and crunch. The patio was a very nice surprise, you don't feel like you are in a strip mall. They have a decent wine selection and next time I am hoping to save room for desert.

I love this place. I have been more times than I can count. The weekend brunch is amazing!  Fez Benedict is fantastic and the G-spot cocktail is wonderful!! The dinner and lunch menu is also spectacular . My fav is the Go Green Pasta, the pesto sauce is so flavorful and the veggies are always perfectly cooked. The one the that I haven't had there yet is desert, I am always too full after my meal.

Went there for my birthday brunch because I had read some good reviews so I thought it would be good.  Man was I wrong. The food to forever to get there the wait staff ignored us the whole time.  The food was cold the pancakes where stale and hard. The coffee was even bad. The worst part is when we complained they didn't even ask if we wanted the food remade or seemed to even care about the quality of the food.  Don't waist your time with this place.

Way over rated!  We had high expectations because of so many good reviews. Our breakfast was $40 for two of us to have breakfast and mimosas. Food was cold when it came out and it took 30 minutes to get a scramble and an omelette. The mimosas where $6 for a bad oj and flat champagne. Service was even worse than the food. Our waitress was kinda rude and seemed to have forgot we where there even though she had to walk by our table every time she went into the kitchen. My  husband ordered a muffin and for $1.99 he got a mini muffin that was just a mix with a crumble on top. I won't ever go back.

I have had my kitty Miller for 8 years. She has never been to any other vet.  I like this place so much we drive across the city just to take her for her shot and exams because it is such a great place. I just adopted a second kitten and she is going there too.  Greatest cat vet in the Phoenix area.

First off let me say that the vet and staff where wonderful!!  The vet even kept my puppy in her office with her instead of in the back between procedures and she called me on her day off.      I had to take my puppy here the weekend we moved into a new house.   She had started vomiting and wasn't acting right.  My husband and I where very concerned because we had already done through parvo with her and her sister a couple of months before.  It was a Saturday afternoon and being new to the area didn't know where to go so I jumped on Google maps and found that University Animal hospital was open.  I called and explained what was going on and they told me to come on over and they would try to squeeze me in as soon as they could.    Long story short Lucy was fine nothing majorly wrong,  found out that she got into a plant at the new house that was toxic.     I don't like when my animals get sick but it is nice to know that I have a vet close that I feel comfortable taking them to.

They have been harassing me for month about paying for tests on my cat that I didn't authorize. I changed vets a while ago because the first experience I had was a good one but every other after as been horrible.  I won't ever go back.

At first they where ok. Gave me a good price for bi-monthly maintenance  of just the front yard. They where good about letting me know when they where going to be there.  Until I asked for an extra service. I called to tell them that I wanted the back done instead of the front yard and I had a deadline that it needed to be done before.  I was called back the next day told they would look at the schedule and call me back. Almost 3 weeks went by before I got a text that they could get the back yard done a week after I needed it to be. Then they tried to make it seem like it was my fault that I was already on the schedule for an earlier date.  I don't know what they where trying to accomplish by blaming me for their lack of response but what they did accomplish was loosing any of my business.

I have been going to Spa Nordstrom for years.  I have never had a bad experience.  I always get treated wonderful and never get made to feel like they don't have enough time to complete my service even when I have been a little late.   For the type of spa experience they offer I would say the pricing is amazing.  I have gone to resort spas that are supposed to be the tops but Nordstroms out performs them by far.  I recommend them for sure.

Man was I disappointed!  I ordered for delivery and was told it would take 20-30 minutes, it actually took an hour and 20 to arrive.  So first impression not the best but it got here and was hot and smelled really good. I got the food opened and started serving and when I scooped into the curry chicken I was disgusted.  The chicken was raw, very raw. It was so bad I was afraid to try any of the food. I called to tell them what happened and it didn't seem to matter much but they did give me my money back. I was really hoping it would be good because my husband and I have been looking for Chinese delivery place in the area. After that experience my search continues.

I have had great service from this store.  They have gone above and beyond to help me with the issues I was having.  They even called me a week after I went in to make sure everything worked out.  Things didn't work out but it had to do with a store in California not this one.   I had a salesman in the computer department help me and spent hours on the phone looking for the computer that I needed.  Then when that didn't work out because of the fault of the other store I had a customer service rep spend even more time on the phone trying to figure out what was going on.  In the time that I was in the store I got to see how poorly the people that work there are treated by customers.  I have been treated better in this store than any other Best Buy I have ever been too.

I LOVE this place. Every service I have had as been stellar. Lee has been cutting my hair for almost 2 years now and I love everything she does. I go with a picture and come out with the cut that's almost identical. She also colors my hair and I have never been unhappy. I go to Nikki or Abby for my nails. They are both fantastic and give great manicures and pedicures. I wouldn't go any where else. I haven't had a chance to try any of their spa service but I am sure they are going to be fantastic.

I will not be back at all! The last time I went was the final straw. It took an hour for the two of us to get food and there where only about 5 tables with people at them. There was a table of 4 sat after we where that got their food, eaten and left before our food even arrived at the table. The server never came back for drink refills and when I asked to talk to the manager she claimed that they where really busy and that she was sorry it had taken so long. If the food had been good then it wouldn't have been as big of a problem but it looked like someone threw up on my plate. SO NASTY!

YUM!  My husband and I went on a Sunday morning for a late breakfast. I got Huevos Rancheros Verde and it was fantastic, very flavorful and not overly spicy. I ordered my eggs scrambled and they came fried but that isn't a huge issue for me because they where done properly and not overly oily.  The service was friendly and attentive and my tea got filled without me having to ask. I am looking forward to trying dinner here. The menu looked good and they have a great selection of local beers and you can even take a 6 pack home.  I will get go back here for sure.

Our fridge went out, so I called American Home Shield (AHS) and they sent these people out.  They came, said that a few things where wrong and ordered parts.  I was called back shortly just couple of days to schedule to get it fixed. They came out and replaced the parts.  I thought great! Now we have a working fridge again.  Nope not at all.  Nothing they did made any difference. Even the ice maker they replaced didn't work. (the old one kinda worked at least it made ice).  I called to get them back out.  They flat refused to come back and fix anything.  I was told that everything had to be done through AHS.  So I will be with out a fridge for another week while these clowns make excuses why what they did doesn't work.

Had a mini emergency and they got me right it.  The vet was great with my cat and the staff was amazing.  They have a great price and wellness package that I got that covered everything my cat need plus her shots when she needs them.  I will miss my old vet but this is so much closer and they where great.  If you live in the South Phoenix or Laveen area this is a great place to take your pets.

The reason for the 2 stars instead of one is I gave Zin a second try after receiving a hamburger that wasn't even warm in the middle on my first visit.     If you wan't a good hamburger don't go here. There are many many places that have better burgers and fries.  But if you want a good shake and zucchini fries it is an ok place for a snack.  The burgers are boring with little flavor and over priced.

Stay as far away from this place as you can.  I ordered 12 dining rooms chairs for my Mom, it has been a month and still not all the chairs are in and I was promised them in 3 days. You can't get anyone to help you with anything. Every time I went into the store or called I was told a different lie.  There is nothing like bad customer service when you have spend $$$.  After this experience I wouldn't shop at any Ashley Furniture store as the district manager cares even less about the customers than the management in the stores do.  I understand that things might take longer than expected, that is not the issue.  The issue is getting lied to time and time again and the lack of concern for problems.

Good food and decent beer selection. First time I went I had the grown up grilled cheese, it was wonderful! The mix of cheeses, bacon and a thin slice of green apple made it a well blended delight. The 2nd time I had the Carney asada tacos,  they where good also just a little too hot for my taste. They have a few local beers available but for me I would prefer a little larger selection.  Over all good place to hang out. Also their patio is fantastic and the service was spectacular!

Mmmmmmm..... Yummy!!!!! Went on a whim with my husband for an early dinner in a Saturday night. We got seated right away.  We now get pizza to go every couple of weeks. I love the crispy crust and cheese that they use.  I am a happy girl with just a simple cheese pizza if it is quality and this is very quality. Favorite pizza in the valley.

Last Saturday we left our house at 5:30pm with the house nice and cool.  When we got home later that night it was hot inside.  We have animals so we couldn't just do nothing.  So in a panic I got online to see what  we could do. That is when I cam across Empire.  When I called I was really afraid of what the price was going to be given, a service call at midnight on a Saturday.  I asked the very polite girl that answered the phone what there emergency service fee was.  Her reply made me giggle, only $69 for them to come out and diagnose my a/c.  I asked her to send someone out, they where at the house within 5 minutes of the time she gave me and had my a/c blowing cold in less than an hour.     I couldn't be happier with the level of treatment that I received. The operator and the tech where both super professional and courteous. I highly recommend this company.

They do a great job at a great price. I have been nothing but satisfied with their work. They even make sure to get all the little bits cleaned up from trimming the bushes in my backyard so my dogs feet don't get thorns.  I am getting ready to move and I will for sure be using them at my new home as well.

I must confess I have no children and I am a super fan of Zoo Lights. My husband and I try to make it every year. I love the dancing light show on the lake with all the trees adding to the performance. I also love the monkeys in the trees at the entrance.  For those without kids I recommend going on a week night after 8.

Horrible food and service.  I got a couple of cold sandwiches and onion rings.  It took over an hour.  The chicken salad was room temp by the time I got it and the lettuce wilted.  I am not going to eat it in fear of food poisoning.  I won't be getting food from here ever again. I tried calling to let them known what happened and the guy on the phone arrgued with me about when I placed my order.  I did it online through the yelp app so I have confirmation.  If you want good service there are tons of restaurants around Chandler. Got to any one of them but here.
