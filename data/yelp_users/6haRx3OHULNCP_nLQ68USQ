This airport was not bad at all.  The layout is a little annoying but the tsa was actuality pretty fast here.  The car rental center was a little confusing to get to. The service here was fast and friendly.  It's US airways main hub, so they end up with a lot of over booked flights. And giving up your seat is definitely worth it.

This was a very interesting place to visit abs there's wildlife ago over the park,  came here for the chili and chocolate event and it did not disappoint. They had both an indoor and outdoor section.  There was also a stage for cultural shows as well.  I'd come back here again.

This is probably one of the most efficient airports I have been too. From the time I check-in to the time i get to my flight is literally a 30min ordeal. Not bad at all, no long line or waits. and TSA guys aren't jerks to you either. Infact i love that they don' talk to me to try to make small talk, they hustle me through and send me on my way. Only bad experince was with Delta when the lady told me I wouldn't make my flight when I had 30mins till they closed the gate. She didnt even give me a chance to try and make my flight. Otherwise i love that it's in a valley and you get to see cool thunderstorms as you land.

This is right near where I live, infact just across the street. It's never busy or crowded and theres also plenty of working machines. The best part is that it's cheaper to do my launder here than it is at my apartment, and all I have to do is cross the street. The lady that works there is really nice, and so are the people who do their laundry there. They are willing help you find open machines and ones that still have additional time on them.

The food here was amazingly good,  and prices were very fair for the portion of food offered. The gyro sandwich was very large and flavorful.  The meat was extremely tender and well spiced.  This was probably the best gyro I'v eaten in a long time. Also ordered the combo kabob platter.  The grilled meat tasted very authentic and the hummus was very good as well.

So the wife wants to get her nails done and drags me in with her,  instead of being bored i decided to join in, oh lawd sweet baby Jesus there was some jacka$$ery going on in here. I'm a guy so I just got my toes clipped, filed and got foot rub.  The foot was so bad,  she was digging her claws into my man skin.  Yes literal claws, her fake nails were very sharp and looked worse than her botox job.  Then she did my wife's hand nails for almost 2 hours. She put like 9 coats of paint on her nails and said that it was normal.  I'm a dude and even I know that f*ckery ain't real nail paint.  Then the paint on her nails started to peel off the next day,  her toes were so jagged that they started putting holes in her socks. She messed up my to nails so bad that they started getting caught in the sheets.  Thanks sweet baby Jesus I didn't tip her.  I knew not to trust someone with a bad makeup and botox job,  she looked 2 types of sleazy and all kinds of lost.  When will yelp let me give 0 stars or make a thumbs down button?

This place legitimately sucked.  The wife dragged me in to get a pedicure with her and went along for the foot rub.  They lady made me pay $26 for pretty much nothing.  She hurried my wife and I out of there and did more talking than working. Since I don't get my nails painted they are supposed to give me a longer foot massage. Instead the lady just treated my feet like a animal in a petting zoo for 5 minutes and hurried to the next customer.  Then the other lady kept asking my wife if she wanted designs on her toes.  My wife answered "no" about 5 times and the lady still kept trying to up charge on the designs. My wife wanted the paint that changed colors with the temperature. At first the lady said they had it but then said it was too old and didn't want to use it. So the lady was pretty much lying so she could do some designs on my wife's toes and up charge her.  Instead we just walked out and didn't tip them.  I wish there was a dislike button,  this place really sucks.  If you're not a regular customer they do not treat you well at all.

This place was pretty cool,  there's a lot of history in the building.  Even though it was the old capitol building,  it is no longer in use so now is just a museum. Didn't have time to check out the house of representative our the Senate, but I'll get around to it next time.

There is a petrified stump in front of the building and there are several statues around the area. There is a volunteer guide in the building that will give you a free verbal tour and explain a little about the history of Arizona.

This was some of the best ice cream iv had,  probably because it didn't taste like processed chemicals. In fact you can tell when something doesn't have farmer Johns high fructose corn syrup in it.  The strawberry shortcake ice cream was my favorite. I asked for it in a chocolate dipped cone. I think the cones are pre purchased but that's just a minor detail

Aside from my personal mechanic in Atlanta, GA these guys are second to none. They were honest with, didn't bs me around and best of all they were willing to work with my extended warranty. What i liked the most is that they were down to earth and didn't make a big deal about anything. They worked quickly, and they keep in touch the entire time they have your car. I have been here twice with my car and have been satisified with the results each time. I only stick to hondas and toyotas, and now that i found these guys, my honda will always come here.

Sold 4 star experience,  or wasn't bad but it wasn't all that great either.  Sometimes you just want to eat greasy bad food and this was the fix.  I wouldn't completely so going,  but just long enough till I want greasy food again.  Cheese steak isn't supposed to be healthy,  that's why I like it.  The staff was nice and service was quick.  But a little over priced.

If possible,  would give this place zero stars. Phuong is a major douche bag and he's the type of person that probably tortured small animals as a child. Went in with the wife because she makes me do such things and watched Phuong file her nails with an electric buffer to remove the gel polish. She kept asking for the foils soak in and he kept saying that's not how it's done and no one does that. Then he asked her to dip her hand in a cup of dirty acetone. Then filed with electric file, then acetone and repeat. When this process was done, he sucked back the acetone in the bottle. Yuck.  Even went as far as to say the owner could be brought in,  when the owner came she said that they do the foil removal if you ask. But at this point it was already done. Note, there was no apology from anyone. If you care about the health of your nails, go elsewhere.

This place was a lot of fun.  Ended up coming here on a long lay over looking for ways to stay occupied. The bad part is you can't just do whitewater rafting.  If you choose that option then you have to pay for all the activities.  The single use lockers were the most annoying part.  Whitewater rafting was a lot of fun,  especially when you fall out.

This place was a little overrated and defiantly not worth the price.  The chicken had the poultry flavor that I hate so much,  and if you want spices in your rice it's going to cost an extra $5. Who the hell charges $5 extra for flavored rice, it's not even organic rice nor is it made of gold.  The food is ok at best.  The only thing I really like were the appetizers, aside that,  save your money and the trip.

The unlimited sushi was very worth it. Infact the wife and I ate about $80 dollars worth of food and only walked with a $50 bill. Not bad for unlimited food. Next time I go back i'll get the sashimi deal. I like straight raw fish better than having all the sauces, avocado, rice, and cream cheese get in the way of tasting the real sea food flavors.

Definitely the best hookah place I have been to. The staff is very attentive and looks after the customers.  The atmosphere is very chill and they have a variety of tobacco options.  Not much on food but you can bring your own.  This is a kind of place I can come to and hang out after work.

This was a fantastic indian restaurant. The place was clean and the people were very friendly. One indication that a ethic restaurant is truly worth the money is seeing their own countrymen eating there. For example seeing Chinese people eating in a Chinese restaurant and just the locals. This tells you that the food is actually authentically and prepared according to traditional standards. The tandoori chicken was moist and tender, and spiced proper. The lamb was a bit salty but it wasn't bad for a buffet line. The chicken biryani was also a great choice they offered.

One of the best taco places I've been to.  The lines were long but they move quickly.  There's a selection of different tacos and you get as many as you want. The lingua and the carne asada were my two favorites.  The drinks are cheap but you get unlimited refills.  The condiments bar is fully stocked with sauces and radishes.

I'm alumni of the University of Florida and the Desert Gators alumni associating hosts the gator football games here.  For a sports bar is not bad at all,  never a line for drinks either.  I never ousted food here abs I stopped doing that at bars.  They usually aren't any good and I don't want to give them a bad review for trying things I normally don't buy. Defiantly enjoy this place a lot.

The customer service at this location is pitiful. This is the third time in a row I have asked for sauces and dressings and they NEVER give it to you.  Might I add I have only neb to this location 3x. One would think they get it right at least once,  AT LEAST ONCE!!!!!!!! No they never will,  never going back to this place. They care more about drive through wait times than they do about getting it right.  I can check my bag one would argue,  but it's it too much to ask for proper service?  You try eating a dry food and see how much you like it.

The place wasn't bad and the service was pretty good.  The hookahs weren't bad either.  I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that the tobacco was hitting hard in the beginning but it became harsh toward the end which took the fun out of it.  They also serve full plates of food as well.

Iv become a fan of the California burrito.  I know the California burrito is not real mexican food but it's good.  The price was right for the quantity of food.  I knew the place was authentic based on the customers I saw eating there.  The salad bar had very good green and red sauce and the pickled carrots were very good. Would defiantly come back

This place is a good truck posted outside a LGBTQ club. That just made it more interesting.  Aside from that the steak burrito was very good,  very juicy meat,  and they got all the spices just right.  No complaints at all about this place and I would definitely return. Price is very fair as well.

This was really good food at a very descent price. Infact it was a lot of food for a price I was totally willing to pay. I had the lamb biryani and it was very well spiced and had the right meat to rice ratio.The service was incredibly fast and very friendly. I would come back here again ad try their other menu options.

Yo this place is seriously as close as I got to the food i got on the other side of the line in the sand. The menu is simple and too the point. They don't have all the fancy bs that some of these other taco shops do. The people are really cool and they get the orders out quickly even though they are serving people during the lunch hour rush. The best part is the prices are fair and serving size is very generous. Three tacos is literally enough to fill you up.

The food here was amazingly good.  The Korean bbq ribs were my favorite.  You get a lot of food for your money.  Wife and I got the family meal and it's enough food for 4 people.  All orders come with cabbage,  but it's more of a garnish,  but they still pile it on.

This place is a heath food dream come true.  The homemade muffins were so good.  The cranberry and chocolate chip muffins were my favorite.  They have a large selection of dried snack foods.  The vegetable chips were probably the best snacks the had.  The buffalo beef jerkey was way too hipstery and I'll never buy that again.  But I'm more than happy to go back.

I literary can't believe the highway robbery I just went through,  I got a full synthetic oil change and had the air filter changed on my wife's Toyota Corolla. It cost me $95 dollars,  WTF is this $hit. I have had this same work done on the car before and only paid $60 for full synthetic and an air filter.  $20 for an air filter is ridiculous,  absolutely god awful ridiculous.  Oil change was $65 alone,  I never paid more than $45 for full synthetic with valvoline or quaker state oil. This guy used shell oil,  their oil isn't even all that great. Never coming back here again and I definitely don't recommend it.  What I was charged was definitely not what I saw on the pricing options board in the shop.

No idea where to begin,  but these guys are more than just an awesome group of people.  Diving is my dream sport and I refuse to let just anyone cerify me or take me on open sea excursions.  I did my advanced open water with John Garza as my instructor and her did a fantastic job,  very patient,  and enjoys what he does.  This made being his student even more enjoyable.  Recently went to San Carlos with Mike and Gary and they were an entertaining pair. Made my first time in Mexico unforgettable. It also helped that they knew all the dive spots. They were knowledgeable about the local marine life and made the trip very engaging. On the way back we got stuck at the border for three hours,  so Gary helped kill the time with putting on Gabriel Iglesias on his ipad. I always say when you go diving, your life expectancy is only as long as your tank has air. Go with people who enjoy what they do. It's how know they will have your back.  The staff at the shop is very friendly and always made sure I was taken care of.  I wound recommend them to anyone.

I wasn't raised in the Eastern Hemisphere so i don't know what true indo-chinese food is supposed to taste like since I have no comparison. However, the stars is mainly for service. The food itself was ok at best. It was more like my mom making the brown people version of ramen noodles. The lamb the noodles came was pretty good, but it doesn't belong in noodles. The place has a hipstery feel to it which isn't big. I mainly went to eat and i wasn't impressed. Usualy give food places 5 star reviews unless the service was bad or if the food just wasn't as good as i thought it would be.

Probably the best thai food I had. When I ordered the server asked how hot I wanted my food,  so I said "thai hot" , he said that was about a 4 on a scale to 5. So I asked to get it as hot as possible.  He looked at me like I was crazy,  so I looked at him like he was crazy for thinking I couldn't the heat,  so I asked for a 10 on a scale of 1 to 5. The food was so hot I might as well have been eating the peppers,  but it was so good I couldn't stop eating.

Solid three star experience but 4 stars for service.  The service is fast and friendly.  The Gelato isn't much to rave over but the raw ingredients made the trip worth it. The chocolate chip flavor was very good,  and the bitter after taste went well with the sweet flavor  Is come back here again.  Just not any time soon.

Usually nail places are a big rip off fest,  I thought this place was going to disappoint as well.  My usually drags me to these places.  To my surprise the people here were nice and they don't make walk-ins stand around for an hour.  They actually speak to you and they don't ask personal questions.  The thing I liked the most is they spoke English there.  I don't mean this on a racist manner,  what I mean is they don't carry on their own conversation in front of you in their own language and they don't talk about you in front of you either.  Be real,  you know when people are talking about you even if you don't speak the language.  The lady that did my feet was actually very nice.  Since I don't get nail polish, she gave me a longer foot rub.  Real talk,  she really knew how to rub mens feet.  By the time she was done my feet stopped hurting and they felt very relaxed.  I would definitely be dragged here again.

My first taste of Ike's was at a different location, but doesnt matter which one it is, it's all good. Literally, its all good, can't go wrong with a single choice thats on the menu. Every option is very unique and the portions are large enough for 2 meals. if you go during happy hour you get free chips and drink if you eat in. Other wise dont both buying the chips or drink. The seemed generic and the drinks were RC cola options. Don't let sub-par chips ruin the Ike's experience.

I have been skeptical about this place,  but it was nice to see a business owner take steps keep customers happy.  Instead of getting mad about my yelp review, he reached out to make things right.  Giving it 5 stars for trying hard to keep my business and will definitely return for the donuts.

The food here was awesome but only 4 stars because it's so greasy,  I mean stomach,  headache greasy.  I still couldn't stop eating because the food was that good.  There's no place to sit here since it's just a kitchen and a take out place.  The quesitos were very good,  and those I would absolutely return for.

this is a two star place at best. the service isnt bad at all but the food is very...meh. it was a forgettable experience. the fried chicken was nothing special and the waffles werent very original eithe,r. i can here after i got done getting out of a scuba refresher class, and i always eat out as a way to unwind after diving. this place is a nice bar but not very good for food.

The first time I heard of this place was when I wrote my review about lo-lo's chicken and waffles. Someone sent me a message telling me to check out Rhema's. For a while I forgot about the message, and one Sunday after hiking my wife was in the mood for soul food and we found this place. Naturally we drove over to try the place out. When we went looking for it, the place was tucked away in the corner of this plaza. When you first walk in there is a southern theme to the place. The menu is simplistic and to the point,no high end nonsense and no frills. The lady the register was very inviting and she explained the menu to us. I got the half chicken and my wife got the chicken and waffles. I think the lady was the owner along with her husband. Going to guess and say her name is Rhema, I'm probably wrong and I never asked. She told us about the red velvet waffle and the cake corn bread that has a sweet icing. I was too hungry to listen to the whole pitch. Long story short the food came out and the portions were very healthy and filling. We didn't know the chicken with the waffles would be like small tenders. My wife doesn't each much do it didn't bother her. My half a chicken was enough for two meals, but my fat a$$ ate it all. In fact the food was so good i felt like I had to smack somebody. The prices were fair and my wife and I had a brief convo with the who we think are the owners. They were nice people, direct, and the lady made some really good iced tea. I would come back again but it's so far that I would drive back once a month as a treat.

I consider this the chariot of the people. I absolutely love public transportation and the light rail is a great way to get around Phoenix and the metro area. I wish they would expand the service throughout the valley instead of just cutting down the middle. The fair is very cheap, $2 for a one way ticket anywhere is great deal anywhere. I especially like that its on time, clean and accommodates bikes.  Next time I need to go down town I will just take the train. It's cheaper and a lot faster.

Had a craving for sushi,  first and last time I go to anything less than 4 stars and a chain restaurant.  The California roll was very fishy,  and the tuna roll tasted frozen.  Afterwards the food did not sit well with me at all.  Bad sushi going down is on thing,  but making you sick another. Not going back,  but 2 stars for service.

Went to this place on halloween, and they were packed. In fact they serve great drunk food. Don't walk in expecting burgers because you won't find it. It's a fries joint, they have fries served with whatever you want right on top. The standard is just fries smothered in cheese curds and brown gravy. Next time i go back I'll get some meat on my fries in addition to the cheese curds.

A lot of fun,  the room is full of surprises and it keeps you on your toes the whole time. They told us the room had clues that really make you think,  but some of the clues seemed a little random.  I would come back again after she changes up the theme just to see what other surprises she comes up with. The place is in a medical park so it's a little hard to find.

I'm sold on this place just based on the cookie, yea it's that good.  The sandwiches are equally as amazingly good,  and it's all home made.  One of my favorite things is that they serve filtered water,  I think thats what makes the food so good. Everything was rich in flavor and very moist. I'm definitely taking home a pie.  Turns out NASA had taken their bread into space, so i guess their food is out of this world.  Literally.  No doubt I'll be back,  excellent for lunch.
