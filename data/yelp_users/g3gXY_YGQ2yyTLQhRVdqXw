So about last night...i had fun hanging with my Cali girls in Scottsdale haven't danced like that in a loooong ass time but I still got it. But I will never set foot into MINT ever again they are on some fuck ass fuck boy shit. So they tell you no hats but once you walk in every mother fucker in there is wearing a hat esp at 1:40am I set my hat to the side and try and hide it as best as I can because its a fly ass hat and my fav hat that I wear. The night ends and I go to get my hat and what do you know out of all the hats that were still there mine was the only one missing and it was a employee that took that shit too wish I knew your name fuck boy you looked real stupid when I called you out on it too. The club said that only people with bottles can wear hats and i know daaaamn well all them dudes in there did not have a table or bottle smh. It cost me $3 to get in and lost a $45 investment I got robbed at MINT fuck that club and everyone in y'all can kiss my ass. At least at Intl I always get my hats back and they make sure of it.
