Do not go here!   This place simply nasty. I have been to any hot yoga classes and this studio is by far the worst.   They have mold and such a stench that lingers through the entire place. Honestly, made me sick. It is so unkempt and dirty!  I would never suggest this place to anyone.

These type of chain places are noy my jam- It was OK- they do have some pretty awesome Happy Hour Specials on drinks and food- that being said, i would come back, but only for those deals and only with girlfriends for dinner and drinks during HH- otherwise, you are getting crap.

This is by far the best Mexican food I have had in the Phoenix area. The meat was tender, shredded and flavorful and they had a lot of great options to try all your favorites. Definitely a gem in the area and I would recommend!

This is seriously a hidden gem! Right off the corner of 16th street and Camelback. The burgers are cooked with red wine and you can really taste the wine once the burger is cooked- added with the cheese and awesome fries, this place is killer. they also have a sweet lunch menu deal that includes fries for like $6!

I am a fan of this place, however, I do think they are a tad on the expensive side, seeing as though they are in a strip mall next to a water store... food is good but pricy.

This was the first time I came here and it was OK.   The chicken was flavorful but the salsa were definitely lacking.   Also, kind of on the expensive side considering it's a " fast causal" type place.

I have been to this salon many, many times and even drive from Indian School and the 51 area to get there- I used to work around the corner and always had great service. Until now- I went into the salon with my mother who was visiting from out of town to get a mani and pedi done on both of us.   The experience in the salon was bad- we waited for nearly 25 minutes to get started, but the weird thing was that there were not many others waiting in line before us or seated in the chairs- they were just socializing and taking time between appointments.. odd.   Once seated, they did a fair job on my toes and moved on to my gel manicure- all seemed to be good until now, not a week has gone by and 3 of my gels have popped off! this is not a normal thing for gels to do so quickly. My cuticles are also all jagged and are tearing up wear she buffed too close to my skin, now resulting in crappy looking fingers- I am pissed that my gels are already peeling off- she must have missed a step or something bc this has never happen to me before and I get gels regularly. VERY DISAPOINTED   Also, very odd, but there are NO prices listed anywhere in the salon, they only have them printed on a flyer they hand out on request- after having our nails done both my mother and I, no one came up to us to tell us what we owed. We sat there waiting until finally getting up and walking to the register, no one met us there and we waited until someone came up and randomly assigned a price to our services, without knowing for sure what we had done. I asked for clarification on price and a man that worked there who was close by yelled in a rather loud voice" Do you have a problem with the price?!"... No, I don't have a problem with the price- I do however have a problem with poor quality service, rude staff, shady customer service and bad nails.   I would not drive 25 minutes to come back to this salon, unless it was to have my gels fixed! $100 plus tip down the drain.

YUMMMMY. Nothing on earth beats a good, char cooked hot dog and Ted's does this perfectly. I love getting a dog, corn dog and fries and pigging out- add some melted cheese sauce and you are really in business!   Love this place and highly recommend!

I have to start this review by saying that i LOVE cheeseburgers- They are my most favorite thing. This being the case, i have tried many a burger place in my day.   Johnny Rockets is usally pretty good. They are known for having thin, smashed, juicy meat and tasty fries. This is not the case at this particular location in the Scottsdale Fashion Square. This location is always rushed and does not have the same taste as many other locations i have been.   My most recent vistit was to have a Classic Cheeseburger with well done bacon, side of fries and root beer. Burger was GREASY!, bacon was barely cooked and was mostly fat and fries came out WAY before the food.   I was not as happy as i usually am after eating a burger- this place needs work- they are not living up to the name!

I have to say, Phoenix has too many pizza places, but LGO- is one of the best!   They have the best types of pizza that you can't find anywhere else and they are perfect for sharing- they also have pimento cheese dip that is to die for! Love it.   They also have a great gift shop side that has lots of cute gifts and little things   Go here and enjoy with your friends!

I really, really enjoy this place. I think they have such a cool atmosphere going on and their food is just to die for.   We always make a reservation when we come and the service is always wonderful.   I usually get the Filet that comes in a horseradish sauce that is amazing! Not what you would think, and not spicy. Just flavorful and savory. My mouth waters just thinking about it!  The wine list and desert list are also great. Great place for date night or just to grab dinner with friends.   They also sell gift cards at Costco that are $100 in food for only $70! Great deals and great food. One of the best!

This was my first time coming into this salon. I was getting my hair cut in the same plaza and thought I would give it a try.   the first thing I will say is that they advertise in the salon that they will put fresh fruit juices on your feet... I don't really get why, but I was open to the experience. When it was time for this juice explosion to occur, the lady doing my toes took a half cut open and clearly already used orange and rubbed it on my feet. very very odd. not to mention the fruit looked like it was already rubbed on someone else's feet prior to mine.   Overall, the price was way too high, over $47 for a mani and pedi and the experience was nothing short of odd.   pass.

This is such a fun, little place. Its technically a hot dog stand with tables and chairs but something about this place made me feel like such a local Phoenician! lol.   They serve Sonoran dogs that are wrapped in bacon with all the fixin's! So delicious. The bread and cheese they use are just fantastic. The owner was such a sweet lady and they were also quick.   I will definitely be back to this place sometime soon. 2 hotdogs and 2 sodas for $9.00? SCORE!

They have the best cocktails! They are all made with great, fun and creative ingredients- not to mention they are a blast to watch being made, if you are sitting at the bar.   The pizzas are also top notch and amazing.   The only compliant I would make is that the valet company they use is RUDE.

I had never been in before but had heard a lot about it from friends in the area. Finally made it in and was happy to see many of my favorites from the Fox Concepts there. They also have a pretty sweet Happy Hour- with serious deals on drinks and apps.   The ambiance was also great and had a great view of downtown Phx.   I enjoyed my pretzel bites, gin drink and delicious cheddar cheese appetizer!

I came here for the shear fact that it is very close to home. I do not think i would ever come back! They did a descent pedi, but totaly ruined my finger nails. I told the gal that i wanted a overlay put on them to add some length and make the nails look more polished for a special occasion. She cut my nails very short, put the over lay on top and did not bother to buff or make them look even. they were all different thinknesses, sizes and shapes! AWFUL. It looked a hot mess. I didnt have time to have her fix them bc i was running late to catch my flight. The nails all chipped and broke off within 1-2 days and now my nails are in a even worse state after they feel off. She had no clue what she was doing.

Yum.  I will say, there are "better" places to go for Mexican food, but nothing beats the easy and fast aspect like Garcias. this time I tried the happy hour sampler platter and it was SO MUCH food and for only like $6 dollars- deal of the day.   I will definitely be coming back and enjoying my meal again soon!

PASS THIS PLACE- The food and service here were awful.   We came into this place with a reservation when we arrived in Vegas in September and right off the bat were not greeted at all. We should have known from there the experience would be bad.   We sat down and were immediately rushed into ordering our food and drinks- after our drinks came, which were blah, our food  finally came. We ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and a side of their so-called-famous meatballs.  The pizza was SO GREASY that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. When we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.  The meatball was just ok. Nothing to write home about.   When our server came back to check on us we mentioned to her that the pizza was on the greasy side. She then said in a very rude tone that "That is how it is and that is normal for ALL pizza". I was offended with that remark. She has no idea what kind of pizza is normal if she thinks THAT was normal.   Any who, the manger came over and had a very similar attitude.   We paid our expensive tab and left- never to return, as I urge you to do the same.

I didn't think this place was anything special. I think they think they are too cool for school- but I was left wanting more and felt very unsatisfied with my food. It's really unfortunate because they are in such prime location.   Skip them and go to LGO or Postinos instead.

This is my second time coming to the salon. It is very clean and they have a beautiful ambience. They do a great job and I would highly recommend this place.  They are a tad on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for. They do a long massage, use hot stones, hot towels, and have more polishes than most salons.   No exaggeration - they have about 200 gel polish colors, I do think this is a tad excessive, it makes it incredibly difficult to pick a color when you have that many options. They all start to blend together.

EKK- Pass this place.   I came into this place for the first time the other day and i was having high hopes for a new, awesome BBQ place close to home- this was not it.   At first glance, i was surprised to see the menue only has brisket on select days, no mac-n-cheese anywhere in sight and the prices are on the high side.   I ordered a split meat platter- pulled chicken and pulled pork, corn bread and chips. My meat was such a small portion i was shocked- not to mention, my pulled chicken was not pulled, it was roughly chopped and tasted like cheap chinese food quality chicken. the cornbread was filled with jalojenos (which it did not say on the menue!) and the chips were a small bag of lunch sytle lays... The pork was good. I have to give credit when credit is due.   Other than that, the server was slow and could care less that she took forever to refill drinks or that she took a long time to bring the food to our table, bringing the food in shifts with 5-10 minutes inbetween each persons food.   The cherry on the cake was when we were getting up to leave we say her offering samples to other patrons so they could try the different types of meat before they picked their meals- We would have LOVEDDD this option, bc had we tried a few things before we picked we probably would have been much happier.
