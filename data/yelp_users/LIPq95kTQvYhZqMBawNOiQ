I've given Plato's more chances than I probably should have. I went to sell some items that were mostly in-season, department store carried brands, and a couple really nice items. I tried to go the other day around 6, but I was told that I could only do a trade or receive store credit if I wanted to sell. No big deal, I figured I'd just go the day after. When I went in the next day, there was maybe one person ahead of me on the sign in sheet. It took them an entire hour to go through my items and present me an offer. I only had three bags, one of which was only shoes. They had no problem helping other customers and sellers before me though. I think I saw about four or five different sellers' names get added to the list before mine. The wait wouldn't have been so bad had there been a place to sit or had I been in the mood to shop. It also could have been improved by alerting the sellers in a more efficient way than writing their name up on a white board and waiting for the sellers to present themselves.   There seemed to be a lot of staff behind the counter not doing anything other than talking. It could have just been a weird time in between shifts, but after more employees showed up for their evening shift, I still waited about 40 minutes. They took 6 items and I received $16. I almost asked for my clothes back because it didn't seem worth it, but I was afraid that would take another half hour.   I was able to peruse their items and like many other reviewers have said, the items all seemed over-worn, of a low quality and from brands I would never buy second hand. Many of the shoes actually looked dirty. While I understand that the store is more so aimed towards younger people like myself, I'd rather buy new clothes at Forever21 or H&M which aren't expensive to begin with, and in some cases, fall apart easily. The items at Plato's aren't impressive. This is apart from the jeans, which seemed to be in good condition. That's about all they have to offer. The few nice items they had on display are not for sale.  If they didn't choose more of my items because of the following reasons I'd understand: out of season, not sellable, obvious defects, not a known brand. Unfortunately, they could probably use the excuses that my items were too worn or dirty looking (read as: slightly wrinkled) or because the style number on the tag is "not new enough." It's consignment. That's kind of the point of buying resale clothing...  I highly recommend selling and shopping at the following places: Buffalo Exchange, Smarty Pants, Rag-o-Rama, and for high end items, My Sister's Closets. The service is friendlier and more attentive, the payout is more rewarding and the inventory is better.

Forno Fabbri is a slice of Italian life. Their delectable pastries and cappuccinos remind me of the true Italian style breakfasts I used to have in Florence. Their lunch menu (available until 5pm) is affordable and extensive, featuring items such as soups, salads, pizza by the slice and sandwiches. Their paninis are to die for. My two favorites are the crudo baguette panino and the caprese foccacia panino. The kale romana salad is incredible. Their very authentic "pizza romana" is something not often seen stateside, but definitely worth checking out. If you're curious about the mozzarella bar, meat balls and cheese boards, be sure to go after 5pm to see that menu! The team of Italian servers know their stuff and make excellent wine pairing suggestions. It is also worth mentioning that they are unfortunately closed every Sunday, which is something unmistakably Italian as well.

Vertical Fix is the best place to train, play, and learn to fly hands down. The studio is absolutely beautiful and well air conditioned. Personally, the standout reason I train here is for the incredible instructors. They are all highly trained and experienced aerialists (and yogis) as well as passionate and dedicated teachers.   Several other reasons I love vertical fix include: the high ceilings, a well organized floor layout that maximizes the use of every inch of the room, a robust class and training schedule, and their commitment to perfection.   I could go on about how much I love this place, but it would be better to check it out for yourself. Everyone is welcome and the community of teachers and students is so welcoming and positive, you'll feel right at home.
