This used to be a go-to for us, as I am a native of NJ, but it has been so hit or miss in the last couple years that we don't even bother anymore. The quality of their food has gone down significantly and the service is just flat-out bad. Joe means well and is a terrific guy, but it seems as though he's taken his foot off the pedal and doesn't care as much anymore. The food used to be some of the best Italian in the Valley, but now it's truly mediocre at best. As alluded to above, the service is just bad and ill-suited for their roles. Not rude necessarily, just clueless and clearly not putting forth effort to exude confidence in the customer. My rating would have been 4 or 5 stars a few years ago, but now it was all I could do to not give Joe & co. a 1-star rating. I wish Joe would get back in the kitchen again and hire competent help.

Had been wanting to try this spot for awhile and it did not disappoint. The service was efficient and friendly (but not overly, which would have annoyed me), and the food... What can I say? I had the corned beef hash special and it was some if he best I've had throughout the country. My wife's omelette was overflowing with delicious chorizo and was just awesome too. We will return for sure.

The menu is creative but the flavors just don't blend all that well. The guac was terrific but everything else we ordered, which was a bunch because every order is so small, was mediocre at best. In addition to the small portion sizes, the prices for those small sizes are rather high. Finally, the atmosphere was not appealing... too loud with music pumping throughout the evening. For a place that seems to consider itself to be "fine dining," having constant and loud music was disconcerting. Was looking forward to trying this place for a long time, but now I'm in absolutely no hurry to return.
