I came here on the recommendation of all of the reviews here on Yelp. When I arrived I didn't realize that it was the restaurant I had seen so many times before while visiting the library across the street. The service was great and everybody was polite and sweet. The food was really good and reasonably priced. The owner was in this restaurant today and she made the rounds talking to each and every single customer in the store. I definitely will be back. The owner is like everybody's grandmother that just wants to make them fat and feed them.

This place has good food for reasonable prices. The service is good and the restaurant is clean. I've been there a few times and will return in the future.

I get Star Wok when I am at work as I can't leave for lunch. If I forget my lunch (which is all the time) I can count on Star Wok to get me good food fast.

I was on lunch break, looking for an actual restaurant versus gut destroying fast food. Found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. I was greeted and shown where sauces and utensils were since it was my first time here. The joint is clean and inviting, nice and lit. Open spaces. I got the shrimp in garlic sauce and hot and sour soup. YUMMY! All of it. Totally coming back here again!!!

When I first discovered this Cafe, I thought it was a typical Diner Cafe. You know, breakfast and brunch type foods. When me and my son arrived we discovered it was far from that. But it was a pleasant surprise. Their food is downright delicious! I had their catfish the first time I was there and I was in heaven besides that I got were greens, cabbage, and sweet potatoes , yes I got three sides. The second time I was there I wanted to order catfish but they were out. That is the reason for the four stars. I feel like a restaurant should be eat fully stocked at least till a couple hours before closing time. But I got the fried chicken instead. And it was just as delicious. If you're in the mood for soul food and good soul food you will have to check out this Caf√©.

I was out on a date and she took me to Bliss REBAR. It was a Friday night and I wasn't really in the mood for a crowded bar scene. The ambience of the place is really nice. Not a party spot but people were definitely having a great time. I had their pomegranate martini and it was DELICIOUS. Not to strong but strong enough to taste it. It was smooth going down. The veggie mac and cheese was ok. I was told they have the best mac and cheese. I would have to disagree. They good mac and cheese... certainly not the best. I've had better. But it was good. The staff was friendly and the place was clean.

They got us in immediately and Kris did a great job with my child's hair. He even used a straight razor on the edges! It is the best hair cut my kiddo has received.

I came here for dinner based on the reviews posted here. I regret that decision. The customer service was great. But the food was absolutely sub-par. I got the crazy burrito and the meat was hella fatty. The tortilla was way thin. Almost all my bites had fat in it and with each bite I lost my appetite more and more. Totally sucks. I was way hungry after dealing with the devil's armpit that is this heat. Boo.

The first time I discovered this restaurant I was impressed. I have been a long time Sushi eater. And coming from the northwest the sushi I eat is pretty high standard. When we ordered the sushi we noticed that the rice was purple. That's because they use black rice. Which I was pretty impressed about. I have had almost every sushi roll that they have. And I am impressed by every single one. I love their edamame and seaweed salad as appetizers. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.

All about this place. Seriously. I crave this place. Like now. I am totally going back tonight because I have been craving Angry Crab for DAYS. And I have been fighting the urge. No more! I am giving into it.
