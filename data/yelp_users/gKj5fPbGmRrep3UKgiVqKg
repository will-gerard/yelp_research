This is one of my favorite zoos because they truly help try to make a difference in the animal's daily lives. I like to see that the animals they have are rescued rebility David and they are constantly raising money to improve the animals living conditions and the entire zoo. I love to see when the animals are getting a check up and all the things they need to stay cool and healthy. I don't have a favorite thing in this do because I love it so much when I go with my family I always have to see every animal twice or we can't go home. It's a lot of fun because we are members for three years in a row and we get to take advantage of a lot of their amenities without paying a lot of money. with the zoo membership we are able to go as much as we want without having to pay admission. the memberships pay for them self in to visit and the best thing about it is 2 and under are free so while my daughter will be turning 3 she is still free until the membership expires next year.

Very eventful and fun!  The rattlesnake plate was really good... they could of added another pile in because  it was so tasty! Rolls ehhhhh  roadhouse  is better lol BUT you don't go for the rolls.  Kids had a BLAST and we had a nice view off the patio of the lighting  that night.  Woud Def go again but more for an event they have or holiday  or with out if town visitors.  The dancing  was cute but blocked a small bathroom (3 stalls)  which their was only 2 of and the place is HUGE ! That kinda was crappy  especially  because my 2 year old and j were waiting for a stall in a cramped bathroom with a bunch of drunk ladies..... NOT COOL!  Go for the rattlesnake stay for Horney  the Bull!

Who is at the grocery store 3 to 4 days a week I am pretty impressed with all the deals I get!  I'll often find meet on manager special and get it all but unfortunately the organic chicken will bad the next day and still be full price...... Like I said I'm there so often I know they hired new people in the area and moved up some cashiers to management I noticed those things I'm there a lot.   The avocados there are absolutely horrendous I can never ever get good avocados.  Every other fruit or vegetable has a second organic option except avocados lol   The pharmacy  has always  done well and I appreciate  all the discounted  about to go bad foods and the growing  organic selection.    This parking  lot is insain and I hate it so avoid 3pm-7pm lol I just can't deal with all the people going  the wrong way and not using  blinkers and then all the damn kids after school let's out! And I have kids! Lol  shop in the am avoid the hassle  and ya get to chat with the nice cashiers! Oh ya fuel  points and the frys coupon app a huge plus!

always excellent and receiving wine samples are always fantastic.  My favorite dish is the cheese ravioli but it seems a few months ago the filling in the ravioli has changed and I don't like it so I order tortlini.  Chicken is always phenomenal it's my favorite part when I order chicken parmesan or I'll pick the chicken from my husband's alfredo!  The Moscato d'Asti is my and hubs favorite wine and my husband loves the sangria FYI he hates wine!  With all of the new choices there's always something to try and who needs breadsticks when you have awesome salad and yummy appetizers!

Cool park, we had a great time on mini hike with my 2 and 6 year old.  The website  shows people fishing  and in canos......Thay have little boat races I guess........I didn't see any water.  But their IS a fishing  hole under the bridge on Vinyard  (I think it is)  LOTS of mosquitos in the evening  but I'm looking  to check it out after a rain!  Nice quiet time minus the 1000 question  game from my kids lol

Terrific pizza!  The wings will be the true test lol unfortunately they have suckers  at the door when we walked in and that created a monster aka my 2 year went NUTZ and flipped out because I wouldn't  allow it before the meal then I couldn't  get one after cuz that behavior  was insain!  Needless to say we cleared the place out with that tantrum.  NOT anyone's fault but maybe that urged them to move em lol.  My daughter  LITERLALLY cleared the place out.

Wings are amazing especially  coming from a buffalo girl! The pizza seemed it was made with day old crust......it was stale and really hard especially  for a deep dish.  We are pizza people so I was disappointed  about that.  I must say I will be back for the wings tho!!!

Everytime in go my order is wrong.  I ordered  Fiesta chicken salad and it came without the side salsa. The 2 crunchy nacho dorieto tacos we're Cool Ranch and for some reason and empty restaurant has no empanadas at 9pm. Call the number listed on the receipt to complain and its a non working number.  I have lived in the area for 4 years now and my orders are always messed up and I hate going to Taco Bell but when the family wants Taco Bell we go and the orders are always messed up! Always!  The end of the tomatoes are in my salad because nobody bothers to take them off ever. This is the worst most inconsistent Taco Bell I had ever been to and I don't even go during the busy hours.  I don't know if they need to change owners or what but I'm going to stop going. I've wasted so much money at this establishment on crappy food the employees must not care about their jobs.

Waited an hour and 15 min for an exam and cleaning.  They booked a waiting room full of people for the same time slot.  As a customer service employee in the health care field you do NOT let your patients wait an hour without saying something to them.  this was the WORST customer service experience ever!  We haven't been there in a year and the GIRL in front didn't even bother to confirm any demo or recent health history information with ANYONE.  for all they know my son could have health concerns.  Usually my husband takes him to the dentist so this was my first time in this particular office.  they didn't even bother to find out who I was.  I MOSTLY upset that they didn't even acknowledge us and the blatant disrespect for my time.  3 exam chairs in 1 room was also disturbing.  That cant be sanitary when all drills are going and spit flying.    I would NOT say they are trusted dental practice when they couldn't even greet us or confirm my son was actually a patient.  3 ladies sat at the desks and did nothing to ensure the patients felt welcomed.  oh ya and 1 guy was chatting with the girl in the front about faxing something personal.  NEVER EVER going back and ill NEVER recommend this place.    RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, HORRIBLE WAIT TIMES, DOUBLE BOOK PATIENTS well patients don't actually have an appointment time (its whenever the staff gets around to it) .  Corporate number couldn't be found but they need to know whats going on in this office.  Even if they offered free dental work I would never never go back!  this is probably one of those places who cheat the insurance company!

I used to come here all the time not only did I work at this location for over a year and loved it I've been a guest for three years I think. I have been waxing myself lately because they have increased prices last year. although they gave you every opportunity to refer customers and receive a $5 credit toward your wax service. being a young mother to 2 kids and owning our own home paying for waxing is kind of absurd.........lol  the best part about this place is if you have never been your first wax is free. Stephanie and Dakota are the only 2i let's do my eyebrows but unfortunately I cannot get my face waxed cuz my bc I haven't  seen them in a while. I tell everybody I know to get your legs and armpits waxed because after 3 or 4 times you're going to have hair like a 10 year old lol.  They have the best wax I have ever used and it feels amazing and doesn't stick to your skin and your not burned from it unfortunately you can't find it anywhere else.  They also have packages where you can dine and get 3 waxes for free that's great for those moms who invest in their beauty around tax time lol   Anyways I love this place I would recommend them and it helps I had the inside on the waxes lol who are highly trained and definitely know what they're doing otherwise there you're not allowed to have a job there lol

we are never disappointed at pita kitchen everything is always on.. From the kabob to the gyros and the appetizers.  I always rotate what I order because I can never choose a favorite.  Even my super picky husband loves it here and it's always his first choice. The cook in the back is always friendly and the lady in front always asks us how our meal as. all of their staff has been friendly and we have never had bad service or bad food. I just wish they could get a nother location or a larger location because lunch time is grinding time!! Always busy and yummy I wonder how they don't run out of food!!! Perfection!

great family folk over there great product, everyone is super nice and you feel at home...... Being surrounded by marijuana isn't like home though.  2 rooms and a relax waiting area.    The best part is it is home of the Arizona super sour which is indescribable.

When for the grand opening yesterday and it was fantastic. But I was very impressed that they had hot donuts waiting for me and I was in and out in 5 minutes terrific especially because I had my 3 & 6 year old with me. finally finished off the last donut and it was still delicious as ever can't wait to go back next week and try some more varieties chocolate and lemon and raspberry are on my list. check out was very quick and this seems knowledgeable, up beat, great attitudes, and the energy in the place was poppin!   My daughter thinks the donuts are pretty and she had 4 that day!! It was her first Krispy Kreme experience I mean I couldn't stop her lol    Welcome to Avondale and I'm excited to visit again real soon like in a few days lol it's going to be my daughter and i little date spot lol   And I can't wait to get some coupons for drinks and try some new stuff ;) ;)
