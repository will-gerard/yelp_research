Furniture is great and have used Pruitt's for over 10 years. We have purchased carpet twice from them and the first time we had shipping and production issues and had to be on cement floors for a month and finally I had to suggest us changing to a different color as it took that long for them to let me know what the issue was. We purchased carpet almost two years ago from them again on another home and I have had them out 3 times to re-stretch it, the manufacturer came out and said he was going to replace some of it as it seems it was a bad roll but that has never happened and no one ever follows-up I have to call every month to get an update. Now we are waiting on an independent inspector who was suppose to call us three weeks ago and still no word from them or Pruitts. Buy the furniture but not the carpet...

Lavie Nails and Spa is always a welcoming place to go. They offer a variety of services including the new gel nails and I love all the shoes available for purchase. You must go and have a day of pampering!
