A group of friends met there the other evening for a happy hour. They were very accommodating. First and foremost, they allowed our group of 20 or so to have separate tabs, not all places are so nice. The server was attentive over the 5 hours we spent there. The atmosphere was great and all the ambience you would expect from an Irish pub.

This review can not comment on the food at Alexi's because frankly we left.  We patiently waited for over 10 minutes for a waiter to ask us about drinks or bring a menu, no dice. They seemed understaffed and had a large group, but that is no excuse for completely ignoring a table.  I was also shocked at the causal attire of some of the guests. I realize its summer and all, but the table next to us one gentleman was in a white tank top. Not my expectation for this type of restaurant.  So while we didn't dine at Alexi's, we did patron the owner's other restaurant and had a wonderful experience (as we always do).

Excellent bacon cheeseburger. Sweet potato fries equally good. Food took an extremely long time to be served after ordering.

Meet with old friends on the patio last night. Even with the rain it was delightful. Our server was attentive and the happy hour bites were quite tasty.  I enjoyed on tap the longboard ale from the Maui Brewing Company, something I've only been able to do in Maui or in a bottle locally. I would definitely go again.
