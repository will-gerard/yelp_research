I wish I could give them "0 Stars".This is USAA's preferred vendor. I chose Safelite, because USAA needles any other vendor you choose, and it delays the repair work being completed. I ordered on a Saturday afternoon and we set up for Sunday, but poor weather delayed until Monday afternoon. The Tech showed up with the wrong piece of glass, and had to wait over an hour to get a replacement. By the time he completed the work, it was well after 7 and he was using a flashlight because it was dark.  The next morning, I went to drive the vehicle and noticed that he didn't clean up aftwerwards - tape, pieces of plastic and dirt were all over the dash and interior. As I backed up, I then noticed the rear-view mirror was detached. It was shaking and the rain sensor was unplugged. I parked and went to correct the problem through the passenger side. When I opened the door, the passenger-side molding, along the windshield, popped out. I pushed it back in, and proceeded to my appointment. Driving on the highway, the rear-view mirror shook viloently. I also noticed a buzzing noise, which I was unable to determine where it originated from, since I was driving.  After my appointment, I contacted Safelite to send someone out to reinstall. They complied, and I headed home to wait for the installer. Back on the highway, the noise restarted, and as I looked towards the dash for a source, a piece of the car flew off. The loose molding flew off, and struck a nearby car. At this point, I drove to my local Ford dealership. The repair rep onsite said this looked like one of the worst installations he had seen. Due to their workload, I had to schedule an appointment for later in the week, so one of their mechanics can inspect the exterior and interior for further damage. I cancelled my Safelite appointment - there is no way I would let any of their techs touch any of my vehicles.  I will update this review once my car has been inspected. I wish I could post pictures to give everyone an idea of what can happen to their car. My Explorer was a great car , just 3 months old - and they ruined it.

Ordered takeout for the first time last night: Spaghetti Marinara for the kiddo, and a meat lover's pizza for the adults. It's probably the best pizza crust that I have tasted in the Valley. Lightly sauced, great cheese, what a wonderful tasting pizza. The marinara sauce was amazing...they definitely have some talent in the kitchen.

Oh my God, the service is horrible. As I write this, I have been here 20 minutes in a half-filled theatre, and no waiter. I was refused service at the bar, not because I was underaged, but because I was buying a drink for my wife and me, I was supposed to bring her ID along.  Do yourself a favor: drive the extra miles to iPic Theaters. Better facilities, better service.

I don't know why there are negative reviews. The crust is almost as good as Pino's, ingredients are fresh and the service is fine. And they make a 20" pie, forget about it.
