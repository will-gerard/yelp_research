I was really irritated with this place.  I called up prior to heading over for a problem with my wife to check on ER wait times.  The woman on the phone was extermely rude.  She told me she could not give me that kind of information.  When I followed up with 'Is there alot of people waiting?' I received the same answer, just with more attitude.    I followed up with an additional question about insurance.  After being transfered to admissions or billing (?), someone who should know, asking the question again, a non-answer was for some reason rudely given. "We bill all insurances".  OK, thats great, are you an in-network provider for my insurance?  "I can't answer that question!" ...CLICK!  She hung up on me!  I would give it less stars, but I really don't know how the medical staff actually is.  Support staff needs wrk!

When it comes to any repair shop, we have all heard or had horror stories.  This place was great.  I had 3 tires replaced and asked them to check my brakes as they were squeeling a bit.  I had previously called several other places for tire quotes, and they came in at the best price.  What really impressed me was that they said I did not need new brakes yet!  I complained about the squeeling, and was sure I needed replacement.  I was told the pads still had 40% on them and could hold off for a while.  The squeeling was just from brake dust most likely from cheaper pads.  My wait time was estimated at about 30 min, and it was more like 50, but anyone that honest is hard to find, and must be recommended.

I stopped in here with a buddy of mine after golf for lunch, and we both really liked it.  I had a gyro and greek salad, and both were very enjoyable.  I loved the taziki sauce. (I think thats right).  As noted is some of the other reviews, it is casual dining.  Plastic plates and all.  I just didn't mind.    Service could be a bit faster, but the food was great.  I'll be going back.

Love the cilantro jalapeno hummus!  So amazingly good.  Great with the Ahi or chicken, but was best with the steak was bummed when they stopped serving it.   We had the falafel salad earlier this week, and it was horrible. Very dry to the point of burnt.  They brought a new one out, and almost as bad.  The ended up comping the entire check after a billing error wasn't caught right away.  Honest mistake.  In closing, hummus good, falafel bad, customer service, above and beyond.

The specialty at this place is a Italian Beef.  I must say, it was not bad, but I have really had better.    What really helped give the extra star are the french frys.  Perfect!  Really, perfect!  Great flavor, crispy but not crunchy, and not greasy.    The Chicago dogs also help.  I think they are only like $2 each, and pretty damn good.    Definitely worth stoping in if you find yourself in the area.  Just not worth extended travel.

This place is staffed like crazy.  I've never seen a restaurant have so many people working drive-thru, and somehow keep things very well managed.  The Italian Beef here is top-notch.  Absolutely excellent.  I have eaten here a few times now, and do have one bit of advise.  I personally like my Italian Beef sandwich dipped.  If you do as well, make sure you are eating there.  I made the mistake of not getting the ah jus on the side, instead of dipped, and had a rather soupy mess when i got home.  The meat and peppers was still amazing, but the bread had lost all molecular integrity.  Make the trip to try this place.  Well worth it!
