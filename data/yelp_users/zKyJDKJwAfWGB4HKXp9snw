Honey Bear's is the some of the best BBQ you can find in the Valley. I enjoy getting a half chicken half pork sandwich, but you can't go wrong with any selection. Limited menu but thats because they stick to wait there good at, BBQ sandwiches.

I'm surprised that this place only has a handful of reviews, but I guess that happens when your regulars are a bunch of Yelp sales people who can't write reviews.  I frequent this establishment bi-weekly and always get a legit sando. Not too many Deli's in Phx that are that classic Deli/Convenient store combo like you find on every few corners in Cali, and this spot nails it. I usually stick with the Ham & Turkey Club because their bacon kills it, nice and crispy, crunch.

I was just saying the other day that I want a legit Sonoran Dog, and glad I found a spot that serves them up.   Now I'm no math major but 2.50 for a delicious loaded Sonoran Dog=great deal

Sunridge is great to place to play if your looking for a challenging desert course. Make sure to bring an extra sleeve of balls because the desert will eat them up, as well as your game. The staff is super friendly, but beware of Jeff who works the outside services. He'll chew your ear off for an hour about Iowa and a load of shit about how he's so good at golf. The final 3 holes are the most challenging on the course and will remind you that you suck at golf. The wind is always blowing there which can only add to the challenge. The views are great because you can see an whole other set of mountain that are not seen from most of the valley. Overall its a must try course if you enjoy a challenge.

If your car is worth less than $3-4k, there is no reason to put $600-700 worth of new tires on it. With that said, find a good used tire shop that is trustworthy, which is what Bob's is. For $80 I got two tires for my SUV and the owner Genaro took me back into the tire corral and let me choose the two I wanted. After driving it for 2 days I noticed it was pulling a little, and went back and this time let Genaro do his magic and he put on a different set = problem solved. This is where the trustworthy-ness really showed, didn't expect that type of service but Genaro knew what it would take to make a customer for life, and will be going back when I need to replace my rear tires. One note, a little bit of a language barrier, but if you have a problem with that you should probably should go pay $600 for tires and vote for Sheriff Joe.

Venezia's is by far the best place to get a slice in Tempe. 2 slices and a drink for $5.50, and the slice are huge and can be hard for me to finish. The pizza is always fresh and hasn't been sitting out all day like at Slices. The wings and salads are average, but will get the job done when needed. The sandwiches are legit, but stick to the pizza, you won't be disappointed. It used to be an awkward table set up but they just re-did the seating. Bottom line it's the best NY style slice around!

For me nothing beats a great hot dog and that what Ted's is all about. The charbroiled dogs there are the best in town and keep me coming back over and over. The onion rings also will knock your socks off if you're into fried tasty goodness. The burgers are legit too, but get a dog and you'll never forget it.

The best salsa in town, for their style (blended restaurant). Bobette the owner, and salsa genius is usually there and I believe that the rest of her family helps her run the place. So beyond the salsa, it's one of those convenience stores that has everything, from booze to snacks to slush puppies, a real throwback to the mid-90s and it seems like they haven't raised their prices since then. The salsa runs $2 for 8oz and $5 for 32oz, and they had a special the other day, 12-32oz Budweiser bottles for $12, but that sold out quick and now I have a fridge full of Buds. One more thing, it's a little set back from the McDowell and honestly never noticed it until my friend told me about, even though I live down the street. And if there's a line of cars, park and go inside.

This is by far the best club in Old Town Scottsdale, babes everywhere who are totally willing to rub up on your junk while the DJs spin the dopest shiz around! I love how I can get crunk with some Hip-Hop on one side of the club then find Molly and House out on the other.

If you like dark crowded hallways that play music way too loud, than this is the place for you. This place is way too small for the amount of people they let in and there is no dance area but plenty of music to dance to. During the day it's not to bad but avoid when there is line out front because it will be way too crowded and impossible to get a drink.

This place sucks! They always set there line up in the middle of the sidewalk and I kick down there little barricade things every time I'm drunk leaving Rula-Bula. The music sucks and so do the people, it's like a old town club that is misplaced. Don't go there unless you like having a bad time.

This place is the fucking worst. You'll wait in a long line to get in, just to find that once you get inside it's full of trashy girls, douche bag bros, and ridiculously bad music. Drinks are impossible to get and way over priced.....oh wait it's $7 Bud Light night....chill

Honest is an understatement for these guys, because they're the Abraham Lincoln of pool care!   I bought a house with a pool last year and had no idea what I was doing. My pool system had some age to it and had a Frankenstein return going on and Mark came out and did his best to get everything working properly. After spending all day out in the sun trying to get the return properly plumped back in without success he found a work around and only charged me for 2hrs of his time when he easily spent 8+, because as he said that was the "honest" thing to do.  They took care of my pool for almost a year until my financial situation changed and had to cut down on bills. They showed me everything that needed to be done for proper maintenance before ending their weekly service. I would recommend Honest Pool Care to anyone who is looking for a pool maintenance service and will be using them in the future when I have less time on my hands.

A hipster Barista at Cartel overheard my conversation with a co-worker about donuts and she said that we have to try Welcome Chicken + Donuts....a few hours later I realized that was the greatest piece of advise I had been given in a long time.  Went with the 3 piece combo with Korean Chili sauce. Perfectly spiced juicy chicken that had the perfect amount of heat where you could taste the spice without setting fire to your mouth. The traditional doughnut complimented the chicken perfectly and used it to mop up the extra sauce and washed everything down with a Blue Sky Cola.  This place is now in my top 5 places to eat in Phoenix and will be part of my lunch crew's rotation.
