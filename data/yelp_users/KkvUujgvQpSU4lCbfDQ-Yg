Euro cafe was pricey and the food was fair. I had the lamb gyro. It was just ok. The cucumber sauce was fair. My wife had the ravioli witch had more cheese then ravioli. Fries were over cooked. Won't eat it again. So far it's the only restaurant I won't return to in downtown Gilbert.  Thumbs down.

My bug guy has always been quick and efficient to work with and always takes time to go over his findings with me. I have 3 children and he has always been sensitive to their needs as well!!
