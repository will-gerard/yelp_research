In the valley of the sun finding a traditional barber who takes pride in their work is hard to find.  Today it seems that it's trial and error when trying to find a barber who has that attention to detail that's also up on the latest styles.  This place is amazing!!!  It's so great that I drive forty five minutes out of the way because I know I will always get what I ask for here.  I tried a couple other barbers in the valley but this place has the best staff.  It has the old school feel where a man can go shoot the **** and leave with a great cut.  Make sure to take the pomade or other hair product out of your hair before you come in.  It will make a difference and they will appreciate it.   Ask for Michael he is the second chair after you walk through the door.  The only drawback is that there is a charge to use your credit/debit card.  So plan ahead and bring cash.

I would give this place -5 stars if I could.  The only decent thing about this place is the food.  The pulled pork and chicken is out of this world.  This place is a complete dive, though.  The owner/manager seems to not care about service or customer complaints at all.    I took my parents out to dinner for Father's Day.  We had a party of six when we came to The Pitts Again and it took us 30 minutes to get seated because there isn't a manager on the floor making sure that tables are being bused or that the customers are being taken care of in a timely manner.  The service is by far the worst that I have ever had dining out.  The servers are inattentive, uncaring, and speed isn't even in the vocabulary of this place.  It took us two hours from the time that we arrived until the time we left.  Plus to add insult to injury they stuck me with an 18% gratuity for service that was pitiful.  I went ahead and paid for it not to make a scene and ruin Father's Day for my Dad.  Later that evening I called asking for a manager and was told that he was currently busy at the moment so I left a message for him to call me back.  I never received a call back so I decided to email them to express my disappointment of having to pay 18% gratuity to a server who in my eyes didn't deserve it at all.  This is coming from a guy who was a server all through college so I know what it's like.  Let's just say that it is now the end of July and I still haven't received a call nor a response to my email which leads me to believe that the owner doesn't care a bit about the customers.  It makes me sad because I refuse to ever go back due to the way I was treated even though I have to say their BBQ is the best in Arizona.

I really enjoy this place.  The food is very good, the service isn't bad.  Plus the $10.00 off coupon for joining their eclub isn't bad either. This place will always have a special place in my heart, because this is where I took my wife on our first date.

For twenty one dollars for a hair cut I thought I would get more than just a cut with the clippers.  To be honest it was kind of like going to Great Clips.  Nothing fancy just a quick hair cut so they can get the people out of the doors.

My family and I arrived at 7:10P.M. on Thursday August 16, 2012.  We were seated outside which is always trouble at this location.  The table that we were seated at had some type of dressing covering the table.  It wasn't some tiny inconspicuous dressing, I could have dipped my wing in the dressing with enough to go back for seconds.  Finally our server came over to take our order and I pointed out the condiments on the table and he apologized and took care of it in a timely manner. He took our order at 7:15P.M. and it was a very easy order, 18 boneless wings, another order of boneless wings, and French fries.  An acceptable ticket time on thirty wings and a side of fries shouldn't be any longer than fifteen minutes, if that.  It took until 8:00P.M. until after the team captain overheard us starting to complain about the length of time we have been waiting for our food.  She went to check on our order and at that time I realized that the server forgot to place our order.  I use to be a server all through college so I can read what's really going on.  After the Captain walked away to check on our food the server came by to check on our drinks which is a sign from management to go see if he could do anything for us while they expedite our forgotten order.  After waiting over fifty minutes for wings my wife lost her appetite, her daughter had homework to do for school, and I had other business to attend to as well.  We finally had enough and just walked out frustrated, hungry, and unsatisfied.  This isn't the first time that this happened at this location.  About six months ago I had the exact same experience, maybe not as bad as this visit but it was terrible.  I said I would never return again to this location but the general manager called me and tried to make it right.  It worked for my other times I visited but this visit was the icing on the cake.  I'm done with this Buffalo Wild Wings I will never give my business to you again.

I am a typical guy and from time to time I mess up my beard when I shave. I stopped in to see if they could clean-up my mess and they sure did. Russell exceeded my expectations. He did such an amazing job that I'm thinking about getting my hair cut by him next time. I have been going to the same barber shop for 5 years and the service that I received made me consider stopping in for a haircut. I will update this post when I do.
