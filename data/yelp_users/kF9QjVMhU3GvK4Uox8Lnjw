would be nice if they were a bit more upfront with their word...after many many phone calls and just over a week later, they finally told me they couldn't meet my demand. would of been nice if they just told me that from the beginning.

been a loyal Verizon Wireless customer since 1999, so before Verizon Wireless came about. Anyhow, I was in the store for about 10 minutes looking at the Samsung Note II, no one came over to help me. Others that came in after me, they received help but not once did someone come over to see if I needed some assistance of had questions. The sales staff would just walk by me without even making eye contact. Was it because I looked young, as in i'm 27 so they assumed i was just browsing? Regardless, shame on the employees as well as the manager of the store! tsk tsk tsk!

Amazing....a true expert in their field, they knew exactly what was needed over a phone call. They showed up asap and fixed the problem asap. If you ever need electrical company to service any needs, definitely give them a call. I HIGHLY recommend them!
