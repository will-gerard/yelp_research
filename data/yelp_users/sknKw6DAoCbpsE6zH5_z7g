I've been here a few times and it gets better and better every time. The service is much better and more attentive this time than any other time.  I love being able to go to a restaurant and not worry about what's hidden in my food. I had the vegan, gluten free "cheese" broccoli soup and it was amazing! Better than the real thing! They are really perfecting the season and flavors of their dishes!

First visit here and really like the atmosphere and the set up. The menu options are good.  My only thing is that I really wish they were organic. I asked why they aren't and they said to keep prices down. It doesn't make sense to me at the prices they are charging. They should be able to use local and organic and still make a profit. I would even pay a little more for organic options. I was prepared to do the week cleanse too! Unfortunately I will not be returning here, not until the have non GMO, organic fruits and veggies. If they used local that would be a bonus! The entire reason of eating while fruits and veggies is to eliminate all the toxins!

Love this one out of all the 3 locations the best. Although, each one is unique and has special qualities. I do love what they've done with this place. It's a perfect combination of everything a brewery should be.
