Poor service today.   I went in to buy 2 hoses for my car... I checked online for the main air hose... It was listed... When I get in here the staff member acted like I was an idiot for not bringing the hose... He claimed that they only sell hose by the foot... When I said I saw it on line he was short with me and looked it up... Found the part and told me where I can find it in stock with a bad attitude... I'm so mad that I'm going to just find a checker.

My wife and I had a rather unpleasant start to our evening on Saturday the 2nd of August.  We arrived early for a movie and witnessed a couple security guards harass a couple kids.  They were standing with a sign that said "Free Coke for a Hug".  People were going up to them and taking pics etc... not big numbers... one or two here and there..., pretty random.    Nonetheless, you'd expect there was a greater chance of drawing attention of the security...  looks like they really got their moneys worth!  You would have thought these guys started a fight... there were patrons coming to their defense and this one older whited haired guard was clearly escalating the situation by yelling at everyone and being offensive.  He was far from professional and I'm sure he didn't like his "authority" questioned.  But threatening to rip the kids sign etc.. it was going too far.    I walked up and simply asked, excuse me, what's your name?  He said, Why? and I told him I'd like to know it so I could include it in my letter to his company.  He said "Jim".  Ok... Jim... then asked why?  I said, "I don't like you".  Because, I frankly don't !!  He said "I hope you never have any kids"... which i thought was funny... (I have lots of kids...they don't get into trouble...but I understood his sentiment)   I would say, in his defense, there was a lady that he was yelling back and forth with that he clearly offended... she overstepped her bounds however and threw soda on him.  Uncalled for and it shouldn't have happened... again, the escalation on the part of the guards shouldn't have happened either.

These guys have absolutely written the book on Customer Service. Not only did they help me reduce my price and provide me with very quick service, But I overheard another rep helping a man who could only afford one tire, yet he needed two to safely drive off... These guys put a temporary "used" tire on the other side at no charge... If only other businesses would operate and inspire loyalty this way.

I have had the pleasure of being served by Johnny(san) three different occasions and under varied conditions... 1. Busy, 2. quiet and 3. over the top busy where I felt like I should jump the counter and help!!!    This is one cool calm collected Sushi Chef.  He is fantastic and full of class.  Much respect to Johnny and his staff.  I only know him through being a customer...he excels at making you feel like family.  The Sushi is very very good and great care goes into the preparation.  I love Sushi and this place has moved up the list of my closely held favorites.  I'll qualify this by saying that I travel quite a bit and I ALWAYS try the local Sushi... LA, NY, TOKYO etc...

My "go-too" for "Dive Bar" food and drink.  I should say, Comfort food!  The pricing is fantastic!  It's been here forever and the staff is pretty great.  Dive yes... nice selection of stuff to drink...

I suppose it's time to update here.  Really a solid place for cold drinks and "great" greasy food.  How many places do you go and see the same people working?  That must say something about the Pub'n Grub.  These guys are consistent...  I have been a regular for quite some time and I really enjoy the employees.  So... if you guys see this ... hats off to you!

Are you kidding?  They don't have a 6'th star?  Well, let's just say this is an experience all the way through!  If you are grilling out for football season... start with picking up some bacon..(so many types to choose from)... I mean BACON... it's thick and man... sooooo good.  Also, pick up your favorite cut of pork...and just be amazed when your guests look at you like you know what you are doing!!!!  it's going to be delicious.   It's worth the drive and be warned... I have never been there when it wasn't hopping busy... still worth it.    Pork... it's what's for dinner... again!

No Mystery.. it's Thai! We have added this to our "lunch place rotation" at work! Rolls up every week ... I've been here 4 or 5 times and it's always very very good. We have a small group--which means I've seen most of the menu. So far SOOOO good! Calm, clean atmosphere with fast service even at lunch rush. The water glasses are always full... that helps when you order "Thai Hot". Enjoy!

I have to say that I'm underwhelmed with the level of Customer Service I received from Progressive.  So much so, that I'm going to USAA now that my claim is over.  I filed a claim and my car was not looked at for almost an entire week.  (Concierge Claims Service?) Then, the shop that was repairing my vehicle had to call for a "supplemental" issue.  You guessed it... 4 more days before I even got a call.    Incidentally, the DID cover my issue and they did pay promptly.  If I'm paying a premium fee, I expect to be treated much much better.  The USAA insurance rate was SIGNIFICANTLY less.

If you are broke and you need used tires this is THE place.  Look, it's 400+ for two tires for my vehicle... I'm selling it in the next couple months...so I got out of here for $70.  Very cool guys...I'm more than satisfied!

I love it when family comes in from out of town... one reason is I get to go out for breakfast!  Alas, I'm the only one in my house that likes breakfast food.... :(  So when my brother was here this week, we ran right up to The Good Egg.  It's always solid but this was a reminder... when they are on... they are ON.  I must say, the service was 6 stars.  I had the Eggs Florentine... very well executed and really hit the spot.  My only criticism would be the side of rye toast came barely toasted.  I know I could have asked for them to toast it up.. I'm sure this would have been done quickly, but there is simply a timing issue with eggs and toast!  Must be the same time man! ... lol minor issue... I like coming her. :D

This place isn't called "Pho Mesa" anymore... but it's hands down my FAVORITE place to get Pho... The beef stew is addicting and I have to say, I go there twice a week.  I have forced myself to try other dishes...which are very good...but man... The beef stew is magic.  Very nice people... very humble.

We have added this place to the normal rounds for lunch.  That's a big thing... If we are in the mood for 'soup"... easy choice... I've ordered a variety of dishes here and they don't disappoint.  Beef Stew with the red broth...very good.  My fave.  The fresh spring rolls are minty and flavorful.  All in all... I like.

Take out today.  Ordered one Chicken and one Beef Pho, along with spring rolls.  My soup was not what I'm used too.  The broth was not so good.  The take out container curiously didn't include any hoisin etc...  Only a watered down peanut sauce.  Just kind of disapointed as I was truly looking forward to some food.

My wife and I went for dinner on Saturday night. It was her birthday and she was eager to use a $25 Dollar Gift Certificate. We love Sushi and we hadn't tried "Hon Machi Sushi". The server was very nice and was very helpful which made it easy for us to overlook the "extremely" sticky table that had to be wiped down twice. We are not that type of people and I was very reluctant to ask, however, it was so bad that i looked around to see if there was a camera crew ready to jump out and laugh at us. My hand literally made a noise as I "pealed' it from the table.   With that said, I again, was pleased with the servers attempts to help. On with the evening... They displayed several types of Cold Saki and the one I DID want, which is a personal favorite, was really a Sample bottle for Display only. Ok, I can dig that... time to order... Sushimi and Rolls all came out at the same time... we never were served the appetizers we ordered so I very nicely cancelled them... along with the plate of shrimp tempura and rice plate that my wife ordered and never received...   Ok, now, skip to the bill. We rendered the $25 gift certificate at the time of the order... basically, we had to order $45 worth to get the $25 off. We were then informed that the alcohol does not apply... ok... I can understand that , but in looking at the bill to order the "5" dollars in food to put us up... we discovered that they were charging us for the things they didn't serve us ??? The appetizers and the main dish that never arrived... Ok, now my "keystone cops" radar is alerting me... we reluctantly order about 15$ worth of food and wait for it to go... we get the bill and it's not correct and we lost the will to fight it... we were double charged for the main dish..!!!! we paid twice ...for something we never received.   By the way, food quality was "ok". Service aside, I would not return for the Sushi... there are some fantastic Sushi Restraints within a stones throw that are much much better. Voting with my Checkbook, no thanks in the future...   Don't fall for a 25$ certificate btw...

Go here.  Service is tops, the sushi is great and the place is ALWAYS hopping.  Friday and Saturday nights they serve penny beers.  Super fun and they make an effort to remember you.  This is the place you bring friends and eat good sushi!

Siri took me here... "Take me to the closest Cigar Shop".  I discovered there was so much more to this awesome inquiry!  Walked into a Cigar "experience".  Pretty pretty nice... Very helpful staff and the atmosphere is perfect.  Beer or Wine and a Cigar?  I'm in.  Now if they could ad Scotch!  I'm going back either way...

Service- Excellent  Price- Very reasonable Food- I had the Murg Makhani  -  Spicy with Garlic Naan and rice.    The rice was just right, the naan was a perfect compliment to the tasty, zesty sauce.  The hot scale is mild, medium and spicy.  This was my first time here... other places I typcally ask for "hot as you can make it".  I thought this time, hey, I'm breaking in some new people... I'll just order it--spicy.  Well... they are not kidding... it is SPICY when you ask for it.  No complaint here... I did order it.  I loved it...but wasn't what i expected... my newbies?? they gave it a there best and I must say... they are fans...but next time...they get it medium.  Me?  Well, I'm certainly ok with Spicy... not planning to "challenge" them to hotter!    Will I go back?  um... YES.  I like!

If you are looking for a fantastic vibe, wine list and great pacific rim cuisine this is the place.  Even the Sushi is creative... Sushi-mi served on top of See Weed Salad is a nice touch... I would guess I sampled everything over the last year and this place does not disappoint.  The service is excellent and personal.  I can't rave enough...

I drive out of my way to get eat here on the weekend...I like to start here with some beer... (they have a fantastic selection of IPA's etc...).  The Patty Melt is top notch and so is the menu... which is a notch and a half above what you would expect.  This is really good food.  Service is very professional.  Prices are what you would expect, this isn't a dive bar by any means.  (not that there is anything wrong with that!)

Had my first experience here today.  I very much enjoyed it.  Stopped in for lunch and had a Juice and shot of wheat grass.  I was one of three.  The "juicer guy" brought over only two of the three we ordered.  They forgot mine.  No worries, he whipped one up pretty quickly and remedied the situation... quite nicely.  Taste?  Well, I have a juicer and I have been using it quite a bit... and it taste just as good as home!  Cold Pressed is the way to go... and I was very very happy.  I feel great.

This is a great place to get a burger.  I've been here twice.  I'll be back when it's not a work lunch.  Beers and burgers are essential.  This is one of those places where you get what you pay for... it's a little expensive... but so worth it.

I experienced very poor customer service here before my flight.  I waited at the "to go" window for just over 5 min.  Made eye contact with several servers.  Was not acknowledged.  An annoyed man came over and "gruffly" says... "If you want to be served you'll have to come over to the bar."    Sorry, I was standing at what should allow me to bypass sitting down and ordering and waiting for a check...  No thanks.  How about you put a closed sign on the window?????  I would also suggest that you keep in mind that I am a customer.   Rude, loud and in-helpful will get you this review.    My advice to the restaurant?   Hire and train better.   There was many better was to handle this as an employee.... For instance ,  how about a friendly greeting?

What I love about Pita Jungle is it's consistency.  I have dined at three different locations with the same results.  The food is very good... I've had many things on the menu, but the new one for me is the Chicken Tikka Marsala.  I order without the rice and sub in Mushrooms and Veggies.  Amazing dish.   Service is always tops!

This is the place you go with those who can appreciate the "craftsmanship" of beer & food.  Food you ask?  Well, it's from scratch.  Even the BBQ sauce is made fresh.  All this for the most reasonable prices.  Do I point out the best of the beers?  Impossible.  I'd say the Belgian Tickler is my favorite at the moment, but this changes from week to week.  There is one thing that you must try... the Black & Blue Berry Cider.  Your Welcome.

Lunched it here today.  Burgers are are good... eh... better than good.  The meat is certainly a couple notches up from say, In & Out.  Which I like.  The bun is high quality as well.  I ordered the Green Chile Burger.  I was very happy with it.  My family both go Cheese burgers and they loved them.  I was surprised by the Fries... they are not up to the standards of the other food.  Bland.    The service was good and the staff was friendly.  Not sure how long it's been here, but Yelp brought me today.  Constructive criticism?  Slightly up the scheme, change the colors and bring in some more images etc... for the walls.  Up the menu look and feel and brand it!    Parting shot?  You already have the hard part down... good food!
