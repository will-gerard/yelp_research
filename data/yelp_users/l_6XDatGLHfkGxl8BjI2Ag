I travel to Scottsdale four times a year on business and always stay at the Double Tree. My last trip was below average. The room wasn't clean, the breezeways were dirty, the resort was just a mess. I felt like I needed to get the broom out and help them clean. Even the landscaping was lame. Very disappointed. Next trip out I'll stay at Fire Sky Resort.

From the minute I checked in the staff made me feel special.  It's an awesome resort. Almost feel guilty about the stay but the price was too good to pass up.   I spent some time by the adult pool and the service was nice.  The palm trees, mountain view, and golf course view is simply beautiful.   When you check in they give complimentary prickly pear margaritas.  And it was good!    So many choices at the resort....oh and the best.....when I walked into my room and saw my name on the t v screen.....

We held our company awards event at The Venue this week.  The space is perfect for a celebration.  The food was good, the staff went above and beyond and the AV went smooth.  We had music, light show on stage and a screen for a video.  I planned the event from Dallas, TX and Marissa and Awelle made it happen!  These ladies are professionals!    The only thing from getting 5 stars was the a/c and cooling of room which is important when everyone is dressed up.  Construction is going on so I understand it was hard to cool down.    Easy location for everyone to find.  Signage for parking is ample.  Great day!

I enjoyed a late lunch at the The Greene House last week.  The waitress suggested a salmon kale salad and it did not disappoint.  This is not just your regular old salad spot.  It's super fresh and delicious.  I can not say enough about the service!  It deserves 5 stars!

Enjoyed a great evening with a large group so other than the fact we were very loud we had great fun!  Lettuce wraps are a must!  Turkey burger and sweet potato fries were very tasty.

So, we wanted a yummy salad and a glass of wine after a long day of work.  And we definitely scored!    We shared two different salads: kale & quinoa w/ salmon & Brussel sprouts with rotisserie chicken. Best salads ever! Seriously!  I ordered a glass of wine and they ask if you prefer 6 or 10 ounces and as I mentioned earlier it had been a long day and ordered the 10.  WOW!  Be prepared to pay up!  Service was nice and it's a great dinner spot.  I will definitely be back!

I love Pita Jungle!  It's fresh and  ever so yummy!  Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and ordered the chicken pita and added avocado and it was HUGE!   I ate every bite.    I can't wait to go back next time in PHX.

We sat out on the patio celebrating with a few and it was just amazing!  The atmosphere on the lake front is beautiful on a gorg day!  We only had enough time for a champagne toast but I will definitely come back for dinner.  I love just hanging out casually in a stunning restaurant.

I visited the hotel a month or so ago and it was a bad experience.  Long story short, they gave me a key to a dirty room.  Then tried finding me a clean room which was at the back of the property facing the dumpster.  The bed had black hair on the sheets and hair in the shower.  Also, the t.v. didn't work in the master suite.  I ended up staying the night because it was late and after a long travel day you just pray it gets better.  Well, it didn't and they ended up letting me out of my reservation.  So I had to pack up and find another hotel which isn't easy.  It took over two weeks for the charges to be removed from my credit card.  Such a mess but the GM ended up calling me with an apology. UGH  --------- It's an older Hyatt Place than I've stayed in before but it is clean, spacious, and has an accommodating staff.  Nice complimentary breakfast bar with good coffee every morning starting at 6:30 am.  It even has a small bar for an emergency drink which is very important to me.  Good comfy beds with nice pillows too!  My only weird thing for me is the tile in the shower freaked me out.  Maybe it's time to replace.

The ahi tuna salad is amazing!  If you swing in before the lunch hour rush you can be seated right away.  The staff is so nice.  I can't wait to go back next week!  YUM!

The resort is beautiful. My favorite part about the room is the gold fish! An extra special touch for sure. The closet is larger than the bathroom! Loved the balcony with the doors so I could enjoy the desert weather! We held a company event this evening and the entire staff was very accommodating. Anything we needed (and we needed ALOT) was never frown upon. The food is AMAZING.

Very upscale steakhouse!  The service 5 stars.  The scalloped potatoes with fresh jalapenos 5 stars.  The rib eye with bone in 5 stars. I'm taking heaven people! Oh, THE best warm butter cake.  You might die a little but definitely surface back.    Perfection.

We held a group event for 80 employees at The Venue last week and invited a crew of 7 comedians to perform the entertainment.  Krissy (National Comedy Theatre)  was very flexible and easy-going during the planning process.  Especially because I was planning the event out of state.  On the day of, the group showed up on time, planned a sound check and kicked off the day with great laughs.  It was two teams of three (RED and BLUE) and an official referee to keep things on track.  They two groups were very funny and and kept our attention for an hour.  It was a great time!  After the event I polled the employees and they got great reviews.  It was nice to do something different, relax, have a cocktail and great laughs for an afternoon.  Thanks Krissy!

I love this place! All the doors were open and the breeze flowing through the restaurant was perfect! I sat at the bar and the bartender recommended the perfect dinner for me. It started with artichokes & portabella mushroom bruschetta  . It was deli-sh and only $5. Dinner was seared sea scallops with mushroom risotto and arugula topped it off. Outstanding!

I absolutely love this place!  The views are gorgegous!  Food is awesome!  Service is 5 stars. The rooms are comfy, spacious, and bathrooms are outstanding.  How can you go wrong?  I guess by not booking a reservation!  The pools are peaceful with music and a cabana boy.

I stayed at the Westin Villas last week while working the Barrett Jackson Auto Show.  I was on the second floor facing the golf course with an amazing view of mountains, sun rise, and beautiful trees.  I didn't realize it was a small suite so I took advantage of it  and enjoyed the coffee and wine opener.    The beds are super comfy.  I slept so well which is weird for me being away from home.  The suite is clean, service is good and I would stay there again.  My only wish is they offered bottle water in the rooms.

I love it anytime I can grab a yummy salad.  And I did right here!  The grilled chicken, with bacon, avacado, gouda cheese with house dressing was to die for!    It's definitely a cool place with cool people.

We made reservations for a holiday company dinner here a few weeks ago. It was truly an amazing dining experience!    FANTASTIC service!  The appetizers were served fresh and ever so yummy.  I had the scallops and ohmygawd goodness!    It was just a very on point experience.  Everyone made sure you had everything you needed.    It's a must try/bucket list thing to do!

Seriously the best dinner I've had in a very long time.  Three of us dined this past Monday night and it was a bit slow so we rec'd extra special attention from the waiter.  We had the fried burrata and crisp pancetta wrapped prawns.  So yummy and succulent.  Let me talk about the baby beet salad. OHMYGAWD!  I will dream of this special salad forever.  I've never seen orange beets but simply de-lish.  Also, we had the scallops, salmon, and claim pasta.  Just gorg food and ever so good.  I absolutely love this place.  Go.  There.  Now.

It's fancy.  From the valet parking to the service and food.    Two cute ladies greet us at the door and some how they knew my name.  Off to a great start.  We had reservations so we were seated right away.   We ordered fancy wine, cocktails and huge appetizers. The size the shrimp made a statement and everybody fought for them.  We had east and west coast oysters which I think is fancy! For dinner most of us selected the bone in rib eye or filet.  The bone in rib eye won.  Delish!  Warm bread butter for dessert.  Shut your mouth good.  Service was spot on.  All I can  say is fancy and worth it!

Be sure to ask for Shane!  He was very acccomadating, friendly and offered yummy recommendations.  I met w group of friends for dinner and everybody enjoyed it.  For starters, the grilled shrimp cocktail.... my goodness....it was the best I've ever had in my life.  It's definitely something you can't live without.  Grilled, smokey, and perfection.  Didn't need cocktail sauce.  I'm not a lengthy yelper but please try this place.  It's awesome in so many ways.

I'm not a fan of this place.  We stopped in for dinner around 8 pm and wanted to sit inside and just chill after left the ESPN Fan Fest.  The service was sooo slow that we had to sit and stare waiting for assistance.  We had the tableside guac, carne asde & mauhi grilled tacos.  The chips were so greasy that we didn't enjoy the guac.  The carne asde didn't have any taste.    Not a fan.  Too many other options in Scottsdale so I won't be back.

We made reservations for 11 this week for dinner.  Everyone was so accommodating and patient.  The drinks never emptied and the service was awesome.  We had the all the appetizers but the yummy bread was the best!  Calamari was ever so salty and fresh!  I had the skirt steak and it was cooked to perfection.  Juicy and tasty.  The lemon creme brulee was out of this world  The group loved the banana creme pie.    No negatives to report.  All the things!
