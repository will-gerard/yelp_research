Seriously unimpressed. Ordered delivery from here last night. Lots of food, but not much flavor. I had orange chicken.. One slice of orange in the whole order and not much orange flavor (or any other either). Hubby had Szechuan Chicken. It had a very strong onion flavor - but not much other flavor. We also ordered Pot Stickers. They were big, but again - not very flavorful.  All in all, not worth the wait or the money. I guess it would do in a pinch, but not if I had any other options.

Hubby and I have lived here over 18 months. Love the place. Spacious without being too expensive. Good people running the place. Good maintenance personnel. Willing to work with you on problems. Attentive to problems.  Today, we reported that our air conditioning was leaking water (not an unusual problem in PHX in mid-August). Reported it mid-afternoon, then left to run errands. Came back 2 hours later and system was fixed, new filters were installed and air conditioner was working fine.
