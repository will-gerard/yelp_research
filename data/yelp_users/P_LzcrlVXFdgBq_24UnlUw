This place is GREAT!  It is as authentic Texas as you can get.  Great food, great people, great atmosphere.  To non-Texans this is probably just another restaurant with good food and in generous portions.  But to a native Texan, a son of the republic, this is like I've been teleported home for a meal.  We go all the time.

This is an EXCELLENT Special Occasion Restaurant!  The atmosphere is fantastic and the food is divine.  I'll readily admit that I was shocked.  The average looking building in the middle of an unassuming neighborhood with a smaller than adequate sign almost blends in.  We drove past this place twice (with a GPS) before we finally realized where it was.  Patrons are greeted with a choice upon stepping up to the entry.  A single solid massive wooden door that leads to the main dining room or a stair case encased in stone that leads below to a very intimate wine cellar and bar.  Full menu is available at both so you can't go wrong.  Inside the main dining room the theme is black and dark, even at a 10:00 AM brunch I feel as though I was just transported to a late night speak easy in 1923.  Large plush U-Shaped booths line the outer wall with a center bar and kitchen area in the middle.  The dim mood lighting and dark walls took some time for my eyes to get use to.  I thought this was a perfect restaurant for vampires, dark and cool, without a single shred of sunlight.  Then our appetizer came - one huge fire roasted clove of elephant garlic with breads and peppers and cheese.  No vampires with in a quarter mile of this place for sure!  It was divine and a meal for 3 by itself.  Our early morning drinks were bloody-mary's and by far the best bloody-mary I've ever had.  They even come with a little 4oz mini beer of Stella Artrois and they drink like a meal.  The main course was every bit as good and seasoned for excellent flavor.  This isn't plain Sonoran Mexican Food.  It is billed as New Mexico Mexican Food but it seems to be a fusion of Cajun, Tex-Mex, Sonoran, and Mexi-Cali.  The food is fresh and smoky in a sultry and hot kind of way.  Portions are HUGE and the service is great.  Be prepared to split a meal and still take some home.  We gorged ourselves to the point that there was no room for dessert, but who cares.  This place is fantastic!  Definitely a "must-do" when you have company in from out of town, when you are celebrating, going on a date, popping the question, or looking to close a business deal.  Suggesting The Rokerij (pronounced RO-ker-ee) will impress your guests and show that you have both class and impeccable taste.

Conveniently located in the center of the East Valley and worth the trek from the West Valley, Baby Kay's does Cajun Cooking like it is done in restaurants and back yards from Houma to Bossier City!  This is true low country cooking, right here in The Valley of the Sun!   If you are a Cajun you will know and appreciate all of the traditional cooking here.  I need not tell you what it tastes like, you grew up on this stuff.  If you are new to Cajun Fare, this is the BEST representation of Cajun food you will find anywhere west of the Sabine River.  Do not miss an opportunity to eat and drink here.  They have all of the standard beers and some Louisiana Specialties!   Service is Great! Food is OUTSTANDING! Atmosphere is classic French Quarter!  Bring a friend, bring a date, bring your family but most of all BRING YO SELF and have a hot bowl of Cajun Cookin!

I know QuickTrip is a convenience store, but I would swear they are hiring Harvard Grads as the counter help.  Always very very professional and courteous.  This store is immaculate and the product selection is very nice.  Their gas prices are usually the lowest in the neighborhood and are only occasionally edged out by Costco.

Excellent docs and groomers.  We have been taking our pets here for a long time.  Even when we had to put one down, the level of heartfelt compassion was overwhelming.

These guys are sharp and very informative.  Not your typical "Iffy-Lube" lackies and degenerates.  These are first class automotive technicians.  The shop is clean and well maintained too.  It faces west so if you are going to wait the mornings are cooler.

This is a review of the community ed program responsible for before, after, and summer care of students.  Staff is poorly equipped to communicate with humans and discuss child care with parents.  Often times we were quoted different pricing on programs (with a variance of 125%) each time with it getting more expensive for no other reason than, "the last person must have mis-informed you" when often times it was the same person I was talking to.  Paperwork was a nightmare.  Registering my child took three separate trips to complete new paperwork.  Each time they told me that the packet of information I had completed (ad nauseum) was not the right one.  Instead of form BR-549, I needed DLDG-20.  The only discernible difference being that one was blue and one was yellow and the form # was different.  Needless and endless unnecessary complexities abound in this organization.  It seems that they have invented extra protocol for the sake of protocol as no one can explain why the extra layers of BS are needed.  Topping that all off - TODAY THEY LOST MY KID.  Don't worry, we got her back all safe and sound, but no one at PVUSD Community Ed lifted a finger to get it done.  I had to go find her.  She was on site and where she should be, but they insisted that she had not been dropped off in the morning.  Even after I confirmed with Mom that she did indeed drop our daughter off and sign her in they continued to insist most emphatically that there was no child there that belonged to me.  When I asked what I should do next (I've never had to call the authorities to report my kid missing so this is all new territory), they seemed to care less and suggested that maybe I should go check at home.  Unfortunately they have us locked into a 1 year fully paid contract and we can not move to another form of day care with out losing THOUSANDS of dollars.  I would gladly part with the money to insure my daughters safety, but we could not afford to find another place for her.  My only hope is that they learn from this and improve.  Oh and by the way...  ARS 15-507 makes it illegal to raise your voice to a school employee even if they lose your kid.  So if PVUSD loses your child be sure to say "pretty please with sugar on top" and "mother may I."  Apparently there is no provision for the employee being a complete and total Cluster F.

I love Dr. Levine and her staff.  They always do a great job and you can tell she cares about her patients.  They also just stick to dental work and aren't always trying to sell you some tooth cleaning system while you are a captive audience in the chair.

Holy PooPoo Platter Batman!  This place really sucks!  After waiting 2.5 hours for my food (and several calls to the establishment asking where it is) it finally arrived.  It was crushed, leaking out of the containers and was so mixed up I wasn't even sure if it was what I really ordered.  Half of the order was already cold.  Trying to make the best of the situation I sampled something that looked like the closest thing to what I ordered.  YECH!  It was either F.U.B.A.R. when it left the kitchen or became contaminated by something else in the bag en route.  That food was Naz-TEE!  My family is now starving and we have been told by the restaurant that in order to receive credit for the food, the driver has to come back out and pick it up. Peachy by me...  My trashcan is too good for this crap.  We looked at the food and would rather go hungry anyway.  I just hope they don't "re-gift" that little gem into someone else's order.  Hell, for all I know that's what they did to us.  Poor food quality. Poor service. Poor delivery. And a little pricey for all of that.  Yunan needs to take a long walk off a short pier. NEVER GOING BACK!

It wasn't until recently, when Sky Harbor was listed as one of the busiest airports in the nation, that I developed the appropriate appreciation for this Air Hub.  Sky Harbor maintains that small town feeling that you get from other airports like John Wayne, Des Moines, or Sioux City while moving the volume like Chicago O'Hare, George Bush, and Minneapolis St. Paul do.  Understand that NO-ONE can rival the efficiency of Atlanta's Jackson Hartsfield Airport.  If it wasn't in Atlanta, that would be my FAVORITE Airport.  But it is and that leaves the Number 1 spot open for Phoenix Sky Harbor.  Friendly Staff, Helpful People, Good Food, Nice Shops - This Airport has it all!  And at the core is a well laid out, well planned airport that can get you from your car (personal or rental) to your flight in a minimal amount of effort and with all of the charm and relaxed pace of a small town airport.  I truly hope you enjoy your flight out of PHX and BACK!

Mediocre food (they have "airportized" their normal menu - so price is up and quality is down) but my main beef here is the customer service, or lack there of.   If you want organic quinoa, an egg white Mediterranean salad sandwich and a side order of incompetence and bitchy attitude, then this is the spot for you. It's like everyone here is sour on their job.   The only employee that wasn't rude or crabby was a guy pounding out muffins and scowling at customers though his little glass window.

Fascinating Place!  The love story that this castle centers around is pure Shakespearian Tragedy.  It will make you cry.  On the flip side this is a pretty ingenious use of waste materials cast aside and re-purposed.  Environmentally friendly all the way back to 1930's.  The price of admission $5 can't be beat.  Definitely worth the trip!

I really like to give locally owned businesses the thumbs up, but I cant here.  This family had their kids working here - none older than 9 or 10.  I'm glad they are letting them help and teaching them work ethic, but my burger looked and tasted like a kid put it together.  The place was dirty and poorly kept.  BUT!!!  There is potential here - All it needs is a little adult supervision.

I never like to rate a Doc on the first visit.  So I've been here a few times and I have to say that I really like this Dr. Office.  Paul Strauss is the one I see and he's a great doc.  More importantly - they have a very competent staff of nurses and assistants.

We ate here a year ago and haven't been back since because the service and food was so bad. Today we thought that they might have improved so we thought we'd give it a shot - NOPE.  Still the same as it was last year.  Initially I was going to give this 2 stars for the bad service, but then our food arrived.  Service was slow. Extremely slow.  We were there at 2:00 PM and the place was a ghost town.  We had to wait 10 minutes before any of the employees would acknowledge we were even in the establishment.  Took another 5 minutes to seat our party of 3 at a booth.  They seated us right next to the restroom when the rest of the restaurant was open and available.  Our table was set for two, but they said they would bring another place setting.  Eventually our waiter showed up to take our drinks - I got a feeling of resentment from him, kind of like he'd rather be anywhere but here (that feeling was mutual).  When we didn't want any wine he got a little miffed.  The food came out cold and nasty.  The water bottles that they use to pour water from were filthy - INSIDE THE BOTTLE!!!  Seriously...  This place is right in the heart of Scottsdale.  There are probably 100 to 200 restaurants with in a 1 mile radius.  Any one of them is a better choice than here.  Scottsdale has some PHENOMENAL eateries, don't waste your time at Romano's Macaroni Grill.

This place has it all!  Excellent food!  Fantastic Service!  And GREAT ATMOSPHERE!  We just noshed on appetizers at lunch today and it was great.  I'd love to come back and have a real meal, maybe try out some offerings from the bar.  I think sitting out on the patio on a cool night would be great!  Watch out at lunch!  I hear from the regulars that it gets packed out fast!

NOT A PILOTS REVIEW!!! But as a lay person who just likes airplanes, this is a great place. My daughter and I like to go get Subway and sit in the sun on the Observation Deck. You can listen to the Tower on the speaker and see the planes come and go. Mornings are great because it is still cool outside but sunset is beautiful too. Parking is super easy  Bring the kids and burn an hour or two of free entertainment!

As upper crust, trendy food venues go, I'm not usually a fan.  But the Fork is a great place.  One of the few to pull this genera off and do it right!  I'll be adding them to my "Best Burger" list.  As you would also expect, in addition to great food, the place is very clean, service is fantastic, and they do an outstanding job with beverages.  The bartender knows her stuff here!

Great for a college meat market skin bar. Not where I'd take the fam.  =============== Updated 09-27-11  After three or four more trips I've decided to stop going here.  Every time I eat here I spend the rest of the day in the restroom.  Not pleasant.  I suspect they have cleanliness and sanitation issues in the kitchen there.  EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK - I'm not going back.

!!! ~ CASH ONLY ~ !!!  This place is an absolute HOLE IN THE WALL - but in the good kind of way.  There is no diet menu here.  The Chuck Box is for Carnivores!  Very casual, very open, great outside seating and perfect atmosphere.  they sell beer to help wash down your tasty burger.  I'm hooked!  Parking is limited and the lunch crowd borders on almost our of control.  Get there early!

GREAT VENUE!  Very accommodating staff but be ware of the upper tier seating - it is a steep vertigo inducing angle that had us sick to our stomachs.  Lower levels are worth the price upgrade.  Parking is very convenient and West Gate makes a great place to start or end the night with drinks and food.

Unique and well priced artifacts, pottery and sculptures from Mexico.  This is the stuff I go south of the border to get and it is right here.  No longer do I have to deal with all of the pleasantries associated with border crossings - no more abductions, security checks, drug runners, driving all day to Mexico...  None of that.  I cruise up the street to the WONDERFUL little town of Cave Creek and peruse their massive lot of stuff!  LOVE IT!

Bull Riding Friday Night is AWESOME!  No cover fee or charge to get in.  Atmosphere and attire are casual laid back country.  Boots to sneakers and fedoras to cowboy hats.  It all works.  Prices are fair and the food is pretty good for typical trash bar food.  Early evening this is a family establishment and it gets rowdier as the night progresses.  Parking is a P.I.T.A. so come early and get a good spot NEAR THE STREET so you don't get pinned in.  ENJOY THE BULL RIDING UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL!

I've driven past this amazing restaurant dozens of times and never paid it any attention.  From the outside it looks like every run of the mill taco shop with nothing special to offer.  But that is part of the charm - It's in COGNITO!  As a Texas Transplant I yearn for home.  Stepping into El Encanto is like stepping back in time in San Antonio, Texas.  It is reminiscent of the River Walk and has all of the charm of the restaurants and cantinas along that stretch of water.  This is a family run establishment that cares about its customers.  Atmosphere is a sophisticated casual built around a central bio-pond with birds and ducks and turtles and fish.  The outside is so gorgeous that even in the heat you have to wait for a seat here (cooled by misters and fans).  Inside is just as quaint decorated with an eclectic nature that can best be described as recycling out of necessity.  Lets not forget the FOOD!  Food here is great and in ample portions.  It isn't Tex-Mex like I'm use to, but it was a spicy and flavorful version of Sonoran that my pallet found welcoming.  The price is right too.  You won't have to finance a meal, and I guarantee you will walk out stuffed and with leftovers.  We only had the frozen house margarita so I can't comment on the whole bar (one day I will ;-p  ) but I can say that as far as House-Ritas go, theirs is one of the better ones in the valley.  It is a good balance of all of the flavors that make a quality Margarita.  This is a place to be savored with friends.  GO AND ENJOY!

Lets start with the positive - The people are nice.  Great attitude and spirit.  Now the rest.....   Unfortunately my meal was sub-par, even for my low expectations.  Normally I would call the establishment and work out this kind of issue but this burger was so cosmically bad, I don't want to even drive past the establishment on the way to somewhere else.  My burger smelled, as described by my coworkers, like low tide, dead fish, scraped off the bottom of a crab boat, and "like menses in the sun."  Against my better judgement I put this thing in my mouth.  Surprisingly it didn't taste like it smelled at all.  It was more of a charred death taste.  I didn't get any beef notes, no cheese notes, no tomato flavor.  Really the best part of this whole burger was that I couldn't really tell what it tasted like, other than like no burger I've ever eaten or will ever eat again.  A lot of the reviews of this place are highly complimentary of their food and I hope that is true and I got the random stinker that is not the norm.  But I'm so put off by the utter foulness of this burger, I can't bring myself to go back and try something else.  It has made me nauseous.  Edited to add: I just lost my burger.  Ugh.  Not sure if I'll make the rest of the day at work.  Can't get the slimy feeling off my tongue.

OH MY GOSH!  I had no hope or expectation that this would be any better than average at best.  Holy Moley!  The Spotted Donkey Delivers!  This place is in a nice area, yet still out there enough to feel like a destination.  It is very well decorated and service is phenomenal.  The food is out of this world too!  Here is a prime example of a place that charges a little more than normal for Mexican food but does a stellar job of making sure you get the value that they are charging you for.

This is a phenomenal little bistro, cafe, coffee house, wine bar and live entertainment venue.  Usually when I see that many things together I know that they do a lot - but none of it really well.  That's what makes C4 different - THEY DO IT ALL WELL!!!  The C4 business model seems to take the time of day and mold their business to fit what the customer needs.  Early morning coffee?  They have it.  Breakfast?  Got that too.  Lunch?  Yep.  Afternoon latte?  There they are again with the right answer.  Light evening meal with wine? Bingo.  In addition to the fantastic food and beverage selections, they have awesome entertainment, local art, books, magazines and things to read.  It really is like the super cool family room you always wanted and a damn impressive place to bring friends or a date.  Yes...  It is a bit of a drive for most of the valley.  BUT!  If you plan a day out this way and you want to see Cave Creek / Carefree, I can guarantee that at least you will have a good place to eat and drink between shopping for kitchy knick knacks and heading out to the lake.

We did date night with wine and cheeses and snacks and all kinds of goodies here the other night.  It was FANTASTIC!.  You can get cheap wine and you can get the expensive stuff but it is all GOOD stuff.  Live music was good too.  The audience was very eclectic.  Some look like they just rode in from 1874 and some looked like they were metro sophisticates.  I guarantee you will fit in if you go.  This is a great little place to go and spend a romantic evening.  You'll get mucho brownie points with out losing any macho status.

White Chocolate Grill = Heaven's Waiting Room  There are more old people crammed in here than the dining hall in a Geezer Ghetto on Bingo night.  Food is PRICEY and bland.  Think of a Piccidilly or Wyatt's or Luby's cafeteria with nice decor and table side service.  I will say this - they do a fantastic job at what they do.  It just isn't my cup of tea.  If you like OLD and BORING, you might give this place a solid 4 stars.  Just not my scene.

For starters the utensils and cups were dirty and the food didn't taste fresh. Our wasabi had a skin to it that was more like a callous. To top it off, we told them we had a groupon when we sat down. Then we double confirmed that our food choices were groupon appropriate. Then when we went to pay - magically the groupon policy had changed. Our food was no longer covered. This would be a single star review if not for the great service from our server who really worked hard to overcome our disappointment.

High Prices. No Service.  All the same merchandise you can get elsewhere.  Oh and these vegan pinko commie tree huggers don't carry hunting, shooting, archery supplies.  The outdoors goods are weak too.  If you like racquet sports and carrying a fanny pack this might be your shop - cause it ain't mine!  This is the next Borders Books.

This FedEx Office is what I like to call an "Outpost Store"  they are away from any central business district and as a result they think they can scale back and half-ass everything they do.  Example: They don't open until 10 on Saturday.  When I have to work from home, especially on a Saturday, I like to get up get it going and get it over with.  Speaking of getting it going - I need to get going to find a REAL business center to do my copying, collating, stapling and faxing.

I know a lot of people that go way out in the desert to shoot. With BASF so close, so cheap, so safe, & so nice, why would you go out to a remote location?  A mere $7.00 a day (children free) gets you access to the single largest publicly funded and publicly accessable shooting range in the WORLD! Most other ranges of this size and this diverse are military only.   Take advantage of this national treasure and go! The people are super nice and the firing line is well regulated. Supplies are cheep and there are some great classes.  ============================ Updated Review ============================  I went there last Saturday.  It was the first cool Saturday after a long hot summer and deer season approaches.  As you might imagine - it was PACKED and we had to wait about 45 minutes to get a table to shoot from.  there were other unused areas (small bore, silhouette, etc) that could have handled the overflow with ease, but for reasons unknown they kept them closed.  I still maintain that the old men working here are very thorough in their job.  They are safety conscious and don't mind helping novice shooters - and they do it all with a very friendly, warm, and congenial demeanor.  The lady in the booth where you pay is extremely nice too.  However the young lady at that runs the range from the officers box is an absolute beeee-yotch!  She was gruff, kurt, short, hot headed, rude and makes me reconsider the whole Ben Avery Experience.  If there is anything I hate it's when you are trying to walk the tight rope and be on your best behavior and some one jumps your @$$ for minor minor infractions and treats you like a life long hardened criminal.  Seriously I think she needs to find a way of dealing with the stress of her job and not venting it out on every one at the range.  The last time I went, the rifles didn't have to be in a case, if yours wasn't they had a loaner for you to use and it was no problem.  I arrived this time sans case and they lady that took my $7.00 said the same thing she said last time "No problem.  Take your gun to the Range Officer and she'll give you one."  When I showed up the Female R.O. jumped me six ways to Sunday about the case.  If they are having internal communication issues, that's their problem and I should never be the wiser.  I still like the range and it is still one of my favorite things in all of the valley, but the next time I go, I hope she treats me better.  I'll turn the other cheek once - next time it involves paperwork and a letter to her superior.

The doctors and nurses here and friendly and competent, but I find they have a very conservative approach to medicine and treatment.  It almost borders on holistic healing and if given enough time, rest and chicken soup, your kid will get well.  It has been our experience that it requires multiple appointments/visits before their level of concern is elevated to the point where you receive a prescription or real treatment.  That may be fine for other families but it has caused our daughter to remain ill for longer than necessary, miss more school than necessary, and us to miss more work than necessary.  They are conservative to the point that I get more treatment out of WebMD on the first visit.  Try them - they deserve a fair shot at getting your business.  Everyone's medical needs and expectations are different, but for us, they fail to meet our needs and expectations.  Maybe they can meet yours.

Nestled in the heart of the North Valley you will find the Deer Valley Air Port.  It is a quaint little airport for non-commercial traffic.  There is a variety of aircraft on display and little propeller driven planes are constantly coming and going.  This what the romance of flight is all about!  Now imagine, if you will, a charming little restaurant with an aviation theme amidst this backdrop of mountains and planes.  Complete with outdoor dining and an observation deck to watch the planes taxi and land.  Sounds like a nice place, right?  Sounds like you'd have to work pretty hard to #&ck up a place with that much natural atmosphere and beauty.  Right?  Well they did!  The food is crappy and the service is non-existent.  The price is right in line with Chili's, Friday's, Applebee's, etc.  But the service is way off the mark and when I saw the all you can eat fish buffet I almost barfed.  In order to get the attention of our wait staff I had to stand by my table and wave my arms violently as if to take flight, and scream "MISS MISS MA'AM MISS HEY LADY YO MISS MA'AM!"  She saw me and tried to duck away.  Finally when I left the table to track her down, other patrons prevented her escape - all I wanted was silverware, napkins, a straw, and some condiments for our table as they make eating the food she just dropped off much easier.  No one ever came by for refills on our drinks.  THE BOTTOM LINE:  The intrinsic charm of the airport can not be beat but skip the restaurant.  Go to the Subway across the street and take your sandwiches to the Observation Deck at the Deer Valley Airport.  You'll pay less than half as much, get better service, better food, and you still get all of the romance of flight.

They have earned my trust through honest interactions and knowledgeable conversations.  I hold my mechanic to higher standards than I do my doctors because doctors are a dime a dozen, but good mechanics are rare.  They always give a fair estimate and land on or below that dollar amount in my interactions.  Prices are in line with the rest of the auto repair industry.

Trader Joe's is a hip, funk-tastic little grocery store.  No where near as gargantuan as the typical stores have grown to.  Not Joe's!  I like Joe's for several reasons: 1. Prices!  Their prices are good.  Not always the best in town but pretty close. 2. Quality! Joe's only sells the good stuff - even if it is generic, private label or what ever.  If Joe's has it, its good. 3. Speed! I can get it in and get it out with out messing about.  Joe's is a quick shop!  Perfect for the professional on the go speed shopper. 4. Variety! Joe carries a lot of different stuff.  I usually buy one or two new things just to broaden my horizons and add a little culture to my life. 5. PEOPLE! The employees really seem to have a genuine good time working there.  It is refreshing.  Go shop at Joe's once and you will be hooked!

As Sweet Tomato's go, this one is like all of the rest with one exception.  The food is great like all of the other Sweet Tomato's.  The food is fresh like all of the other Sweet Tomato's.  The food is healthy like all of the other Sweet Tomato's.  But this Sweet Tomato's is SPECIAL because they have GREAT SERVICE!  I've been there several times when it was packed to the gills and the staff never lost a step.  They kept the food coming and they looked genuinely happy that you were there.  They always treat us like we are the only people in the whole place.

Over the past 12 to 18 months our favorite Sweet Tomatoes has slipped. The food is now bland and industrial tasting, like food at an assisted living center. And the service is just as nonexistent as the flavor.  I'm done. Time to find somewhere else to eat because I'm not paying $12 a head for slimy salad, bland soup, and DILLIGAF service...

I was skittish at first.  Good Mexican food in North Scottsdale?  But YES it does exist!  Jalapeno Inferno is DA-BOMB!  Great food, great drinks, nice and clean, and service that makes you feel like you are family.  They have phenomenal outdoor seating that is great at night.  This place is always busy and there is a very good reason - they have found the formula for success and the customers appreciate that.  Go get your grub on!

Ok...  I'm a Die Hard Jimmy Buffett Fan - a Parrot Head through and through!  But...  This place sucked.  I've been to half a dozen different Margaritaville Restaurants and I knew what to expect, but this one by far failed to meet my minimal expectations.  The service is slooooow, food is canned and poor quality, drinks are weak and expensive.  The only upshot was all of the Jimmy Buffett paraphernalia and music, and I've already got a lot of that stuff.  The next time I'm itching to get my island groove on, I'll do it right.  We'll grill chicken and burgers in the back yard, put the booze in the blender, light the Tiki torches, invite 20 or 30 people over and jam to Jimmy.  More fun to set sail to St. Somewhere in your own back yard than it is to have to endure the Glendale Margaritaville.  FINS UP!

Excellent Park!  As metropolitan areas go, Phoenix maintains a higher sense of civic duty than most towns, and that is reflected in its parks systems.  White Tanks ranks in my TOP TEN list easily above #5.  It is HUGE.  It is DIVERSE.  It has EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES.  Bathrooms are CLEAN.  And they have LOTS of EVENTS!  Check out the calendar of events at their web page! http://www.maricopa.gov/parks/white_tank/

I'm soooooo done with Hooters.  I use to be able to defend them by standing by their food.  But not lately.  The wait staff is always nice, but ordering food seems to be a laborious process and then the quality of the food just outright sucks.  There is one redeeming point about this particular Hooters location.  It is right on Mill Avenue and the outdoor seating is a great place.  Good fresh air and excellent vantage point to see the party below as well as the Tempe Skyline.  It reminds me of a western version of Bourbon Street.  Any restaurant on Mill Avenue with a 2nd floor balcony will have this perk - and hopefully better food.

Long waits to meet with the nurse (no doctors here).  Then she walks in and looks like a Colombian Hooker in a hooker outfit that some one threw a white coat on - stilleto heels, mini skirt, coke finger-nail and all.  Not Professional!  She kept telling us about the "conservative" in the injections.  I finally asked if she meant "PREservative" and she said "oh yeah, that stuff."  Seriously...  RN license from a box of Cap'N Crunch?  I think so!

Staff was super sweet and nice. Lots of good customer service here. They tried and tried to make me something I'd like, but ultimately nothing was right. Some times you just want a Coca-Freakin-Cola and nothing else will do.  Having said that, I would have put them at a solid three stars, maybe four based solely off of the cleanliness of the store and super accomodating staff. But... No sooner did I give up on them then the rest of the people in my party admitted they had tried to like their drink and just couldn't finish them.  I think this place has lost its way trying to compete with Starbucks.

I'm done!  I've been here 3 times (twice for my truck and once for my wife's Mustang).  The vehicle is always dirty and they have to rewash it and end up throwing in discounted goodies to help make up for poor workmanship.  Today after they had to wash my wifes car twice and waxed mine to make it right, I got in the truck to find 11 empty water bottles, 2 aluminum coke cans, two Styrofoam cups and an assortment of napkins and trash on the floor (we had just finished a road trip of sorts).  I even have one of those in-truck waste bins.  It was still over flowing with trash.  I thought, "maybe they just forgot the inside," but NOPE!  They did the inside of the windows.  They vacuumed the seats and put the fragrance in.  They even ArmorAll'd the dash!  How did they miss all of the trash in the truck?  Danny's prices are dirt cheap.  I wouldn't mind paying $5.00 to $10.00 more if they could just do the job right the first time.  I don't have all day to be their Quality Control Auditor and they certainly aren't paying me to do it either!  TAKE A HIKE DANNY!  WE ARE DONE WITH YOU!  Does anybody know of a good car wash place in North Phoenix / Scottsdale?

OH MY GOD!  This place is absolutely off the charts good.  The price is a bit high for a "hamburger" but don't use that word.  This is a masterpiece!  Service is outstanding and very family/casual.  It feels like the staff has been my friend for years even though we just met.  Atmosphere is GREAT Service is GREAT Appetizers and Sides are GREAT But most of all the burgers are so good you can't really call them a "hamburger. It's heaven between a bun!  Outside patio is a wonderful place to watch the sun go down with your favorite beverage and then nosh on some heavenly food.

Always an excellent experience here.  Classy bar.  Great people.  Good wine and food.  The ONLY thing I'd change is that the Cigar Shop next door built some Red-Neck / White Trash barn like enclosed patio on the front.  Really brings the neighborhood down.  We'll go back, but our favorite part - the patio - is ruined.  Only sitting inside now.

This place does two things very well - Steak and Service!  Everything else is pomp and circumstance for the sake of pomp and circumstance.  The appetizers, sides, desserts are very pretty but very short on actual substance.  They tasted bad and we sent them back.  The restaurant made it right by offering other items and when we passed on the opportunity they comped our ticket for the items we ordered and didn't care for so they are more than fair. But I don't go out to eat so I can send it all back - that's why I give them poor marks.

I'm a Texas Transplant.  For the last year I've been looking for BBQ that would be as good as back home.  That's a tall order considering that Texas is the Cradle of Civilization where BBQ is concerned.  I'm religious about my smoke and have eaten at some of the finest BBQ places around.  But Phoenix disappointed me.  It seemed as though nothing here was worth the brown paper it was wrapped in - UNTIL I WENT TO BRYAN'S!  The food here is fresh, tender, tasty, and prepared with care.  The sauce is very nice and well balanced.  The chopped beef was gristle free. the brisket had a nice smoke ring in it. The sides were unique and different.  The food can't be beat.  It easily competes with the Top 10 joints back in Texas.  Service and hospitality?  YEP! They have that covered too! Just like back home they were very nice and happy to have you.  We felt like family.  I'll mention decor and atmosphere even though it isn't high on my list.  It is a nice little hidden place right on the main drag in Cave Creek.  I love sitting out on the patio and drinking beer.  It is a fun place to slow down and watch the world go by.  I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!

Service was poor and so was the food.  Hot dogs are pretty simple - it's just animal byproduct in a tube shape.  Yet these people over charge and under deliver.  It is a family run business and it seems as if they are cutting every corner to make ends meet.  In the end they are being penny wise and pound foolish.  Oh!  And when we voiced our unhappiness to the owner she informed us that she has never heard a bad thing about her restaurant and it must just be us.  Really?  Does she not look at Yelp?  I've seen more than one poor comment on here.

First let me start of by saying how much I hate to give local family owned restaurants a bad review.  I know how these can drive customers to them and away from them.  This review is pretty much like my last one - two ownership changes and a name change ago.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Let me start of with Waiter #15 - Lauren R.  Great service, great timing and arrival of meals.  Attentive with out being intrusive or overbearing.  She's a keeper of an employee and a good portion of why this place gets two stars.  Our family of three had Jumbo Nachos and the Silver Spur Platter plus beverages.  That was a $60 meal but it all tasted like it was right out of a plastic Sysco Foods Tub.  No home cooking, no restaurant quality food.  Trust me - Carl's Junior slings a better plate of grub.  Our ribs were "gooey", the brisket was dry and the pulled pork and beef were over processed.  None of the meat was very well seasoned and there was no smoke flavor that should accompany BBQ.  The sauce was very sweet and plain as well.  This place has a lot of potential.  They need to clean it up and remodel it - especially the bathrooms.  I feel like I need a tetanus shot for having washed my hands in there.  Take out all of the old kitschy '70's cowboy decor and pressure wash that whole place.  The menu needs an overhaul and they need to move towards quality BBQ at a reasonable price.  Keep Lauren.  She's the best thing going there.  So in summary - I've seen owners change three times here, but I think the biggest thing that needs to change is the kitchen and the cleaning staff.  Oh and for Pete's sake - Please correct the name of your restaurant on Yelp - It is spelled Restaurant not "Restaurent."

The food here is REALLY GOOD!  I highly recommend the Spicy Ramen!  Sushi is very clean and served in ample portions, probably a little more than elsewhere.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars and not more is because of the heinously S-L-O-W Service.  Time to be seated, time to get drinks, time to place food order, time to get food, and time to get check - all waaaay too long.  A quick bite to eat takes all night.  Great if you want to kick back and suck down some sake while you chill, but not if you wanted to get home and get to bed on time.  I'm not sure what the time delay is - they seem adequately staffed.  You'd think they could make more money by getting customers in and out faster.

You couldn't screw up my order any more if you tried.  This place is so bad I just pull up to the drive through and I tell them, "I have $15.00 to feed 4 people. Make it happen."  That is the only way I can be sure that they won't give me the wrong thing.

This place is the best example of the American Dream that I've ever seen. The owner is probably the hardest working man in the Hot Dog business and takes SUPER GOOD care of his customers. Hard work and pride are alive and well in a little gourmet hotdog shop in North Scottsdale! Check'em Out!

This is a locally owned establishment by a hard working family.  Kudos to them for "sticking it to the man" in the uber-competitive pizza market.  To do that you have to do a few things really well and they have.  Quality - the food tastes fresh!  This isn't some mass produced pizza or sandwich slung together by a parolee at one of the Sandwich-Mart's.  Their food tastes like your Italian Grandma made it special just for you!  Price - The economy is tight.  Everybody has an eye on their wampum and most won't part with it easily.  Rochelli's offers fair prices that are in line with (or maybe a little better than) the competition.  Quite a feat considering their quality!  Service - The owners are in the restaurant.  They are there putting their soul into that place and you can tell that they care.  I went in to pick up some pizza for take out the other day and all of the wait staff (owners included) made it a point to come by and talk to me like I was family.  THEY CARE!  Give them a shot!

Ok...  The name contains "Urgent Care" which leads you to believe two things.  1. Your care will be "urgent"  2. This is a medical facility that treats minor emergencies and advanced illness.  I would expect them to bridge the gap between your regular doc and the ER.  Neither 1 nor 2 are correct.  Even with the call ahead WAHOO service you still have to wait.  Even when the place is empty.  And...  They only have Nurse Practitioners.  That's fine because they are in many cases better than doctors, but they are limited on what they can prescribe.  If you need something stronger (antibiotics in our case) rather than tell you that you need something they can't give you, they still give you a prescription for a weaker antibiotic and send you packing.  So I get less treatment than I get from my doc and I have to wait an eternity to get it.  Now remind me again why this is a good thing?

Stickin' it to the man one cup at a time! If you think Starbucks is the only place for coffee then try this out. You'll soon learn how corporate America has been abusing your taste-buds.  Come find out what happens when you set aside the Profit and Loss sheets, the same store growth over last year charts, and the general ledger and see what happens when you start to care about the beans, the people and the community.  They have lunch food and alcohol (wines and beer) too.

This is not a review - It is a WARNING.  Do not let your children suffer like ours has.  Despite my daughter writhing in pain for three days, Dr. Naranjo refused to change the treatment plan or explain why she wanted us to continue down a path that did not work. I hold her and her staff personally responsible for two trips to the ER that could have been avoided with the right medication.  The only reason the get 1 star is because Yelp won't allow a review with any less.  DO YOUR HOMEWORK!  INVESTIGATE YOUR HEALTH CARE CHOICES!

As a restaurant - they weren't bad.  All of their Non-Cajun food is actually pretty tasty and the service is great.  However, this establishment holds themselves out as a "Cajun / Creole Restaurant" and they will be judged as such - and they fail miserably.  All cajun food was horrid.  Gumbo tasted like some sort of lentil soup with tons of cumin dumped in.  The remoulade sauce was salad dressing (catalina I think) with pickle relish in it.  Crab cakes seemed to be some sort of frozen Marie Calendars hockey puck.  The Po-Boys (for starters should be clam but they had no clam on the menu) had some prebreaded popcorn shrimp on it and lettuce - that's it. Oh and the remoulade sauce.  There were only a handful of cajun dishes on the menu and the one thing they probably could have done a good job at, a muffelata, was missing.  Rumor is that this place will close as Lafitte's soon, remodel, and reopen as a sports bar.  That is probably a good thing because they do a good job of Gastro-Pub food.  If I had to give them props for something it would be their french fries.  That was the best thing I had while I was there.

The service here is HORRIBLE.  I know the menu better than most of the employees, they rarely come by the table to check on you, often times I feel ignored, and their food is moderately so-so.  All of the issues I have with this location stem from management.  they are not being accountable and overseeing their operation.  My guess is that they use their position to supplement their dating life.  I have no evidence to support that, but I've seen it a time or two before and this is exactly what it looks like.

The staff is young and tries hard but they seem unempowered to take care of the customer with out getting clearance from their manager.  The appetizers are actually pretty good here but when you get to the Chicken Wings it all falls apart. The wings were covered in a lose jiggly skin that was beyond gross.  I like mine with a little bit of crispness.  The traditional sauce was not so traditional and after the first few wings it became evident that there was more gristle than meat.  These were less like Buffalo Wings and more like Chicken Knuckles covered in BBQ sauce.  Drinks were typical of a generic mass production bar - heavy on the mixings and light on the booze.  Two adults and a kid and we got out for right at $50.00.  Kinda pricey for the quality of food and service.  Now that I have the hankering for REAL wings I need to go hit a Hooters or BW3.

Roots has changed owners like the Kardasians change men.  Now they are some sort of Hawiian fruit smoothey and coffee place.  Hope they make it but it looks like this might be their last desperate hurrah to make a profit.  Rent is probably the killer in that shopping center.  They need to find a cheaper place if they are going to make it.  GO NOW because they might not be there in three months.

Ugh.  I really hate to write this review...  I love to support local businesses and especially BBQ.  But this one is worth driving past.  On the upside, the staff works really hard and I hope they can turn this place around, but it seems as though their business model is based on copious amounts of really bad food served by chesty 19 year-olds wearing tight, thin black tank tops and low rise jeans.  Not that I have anything against chesty young ladies bringing me food, but you have to have more than that to stay in business.  Imagine if Hooters opened a 3rd rate BBQ shack.  Skip this place and check out the Buffalo Chip - You'll be glad you did.

They are the perfect guilty pleasure.  The food is low cal (compared to Ice Cream), the prices are very reasonable, and the options, choices, selection is amazing!  Whats the catch you ask?  It is SELF SERVE!  You pick the yogurt, you add the toppings, they weigh it and you pay.  We did a family of three (and my wife heaped it on) for less than $9.00.  They do have a TV, but it is always tuned to Disney or Nicelodeon - That's my only complaint.

I was impressed with SomeBurros.  Technically this would be a Casual Dining Establishment but with the speed, efficiency, and price of a Fast Food Restaurant.  Our food was tasty and filling. Plus they have misters for outside dining too.

Excellent Local Roaster and Brewer of Coffee!  Screw Starbucks.  This is what coffee was supposed to taste like before megalithic corporations took over.

I'm not a big "organic" kind of guy.  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that.  For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I can.  Having said that, I'm HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst!  Service is family oriented too.  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for.  As a die-hard burger man, this is my default stop.  It is close to the house, in a pleasant shopping center, and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix.  I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me.  This place is that good!

Pretty good cup of java in the AM!  Loved the "crawl out from under your rock and greet the sun" atmosphere.  It is casual desert living at its finest.  Good service and people.

What a FANTASTIC little hole in the wall joint!  I love the food here - VERY authentic and the Luchador paintings ad a touch of whimsy.  You must be serious about eating great Mexican food to eat here!

This is what I'd classify as a "great little neighborhood restaurant."  Good value, good food, good service and nice enough that you can bring guests and friends here for a meal together but not the kind of place you make the haul across Phoenix to go eat at.  They do a great job with a variety of different Asian cuisines so you aren't limited to Thai.  I HIGHLY recommend the Thai Iced Tea!  If you live local, give it a shot!

OK...  Lets be honest.  This is a typical Walgreen's.  they advertise them selves as a health partner and then they put the medicine in the back and the booze and cigs up front.  Does that sound like the kind of health partner you want?  But aside from that pet peeve of mine they really are good.  I always get EXCELLENT service from the pharmacy.  They check and double check everything and the wait time is better than most places.  The rest of the store is clean and well maintained and the Non-Pharma employees are also very helpful.

This Culvers is just like every other Culvers.  You come for the awesome custard but the food is soo bad, by the time you are done you don't even want to look at the custard.  If you LOVE Culvers then you will love this place, but if you are like me then you know there is much better food in the immediate area.  Face it, Culvers is the place you settle on and never set out to eat at.

I just wanted a smoothie so I went to Red Mango.  Great smoothies but the choices and options were limitless.  Quite honestly I felt very confused and overwhelmed by all the options. There is a self serve place and a full serve place and all kinds of crazyness.  I needed a Smoothie Concierge to steer me through all the options. Sadly all they had was some half stoned ASU student who could have cared less about being at work.

Totally not a bad place but my experience was a bit tainted by one of the staff. He had his jeans LOW and his underwear hanging out (trendy I know) but he always seemed to be on the verge of losing his britches. He handled his underwear as much as he handled menus and food. Thats an issue.  I would have told the manager but there didn't seem to be one.  This place will get better as it matures and a lot of the initial new hire crew is separated out and we find out who is wheat and who is chaff.

I like Dr. Natcher's common sense and "people first" approach to wellness.  She is a very caring person who understands the difference between a healthy foot and me being able to resume my lifestyle (hiking and outdoors).  My only regret is that when my foot heals, I'll have no reason to go back and visit (unless I injure it again).  I wish Dr. N was my PCP or another doctor that I frequent.  I think she would be great there too.  Every one deserves a good doc like Dr. N.

Pita never disappoints. This is the tastiest health food on the planet and the house Rita  easily makes Top10 status. Service is always great. The freshness of their food is naturally enhanced by dining outside if you can.

Concept is GREAT! Building is GREAT! Food was just, well, meh... Atmosphere is COLD and service SUCKS ASS!  Soooooooo much wasted potential here.  I hope the owners pull it together.  Cave Creek NEEDS a nice place like this but they need it done right not half-assed.

The US Post Office has so overly complicated mail and shipping that they are driving themselves out of business with virtually no competitor in the market that can do what they do by hitting every single doorstep 6 days a week.  This particular location is as ingrained in the "Post Office Mentality" that they actually seem to contrive new ways to inconvenience you.  If I could boycott the post office - The Whole Damn United States Post Office - I would.  Ben Franklin must be ROLLING in his grave to see what his beautifully simple creation has morphed into.

How is it that I've never reviewed this place before? As many times as I go, I would have thought I'd done Oink.   Oink is not to be missed. It is a great and funky little breakfast joint that specializes in one thing... Can you guess? BACON!   Ok, let's make this clear - everything they make us good. They would be a success even with out the bacon. And the service is great. Some of the employees have been there for years. When you meet them you will understand. They love this place too. I like to see that level of investment.   But the BACON - that stuff is crazy good. They do "Bacon Flights" where you get to see and taste all different kinds of bacon. And I still can't pick a favorite.

This is a fantastic park of mixed use (non motorized) trails that start at the National Cemetery and extend along the canal to North Scottsdale Road and Princess.  Beautiful Desert Wilderness is only a stones throw from our home.  Come out and enjoy!  Remember to tread lightly and pack out what you pack in.

My wife brought her 2005 Mustang to 911 Collision (or Caliber Collision as they also call themselves - why two names?).  Our primary concern was her rear bumper that was damaged while parked in a parking lot.  The other driver was not courteous enough to leave a note.  Our secondary concern was damage to the hood (also while unattended in a parking lot but some time earlier).  911 Collision did a reasonable job on the bumper - covered under insurance after our $500 deductible was met.  The color doesn't exactly match but then it doesn't scream out either.  One of the people that works there told me that you can never get the color to match because the bumper is plastic and the body is sheet metal.  I'll go on record now by calling that out as complete hogwash - Detroit, Germany, and Japan do it all day long.  The color might be hard to match for a host of other plausible and legitimate reasons but not because one is metal and the other is plastic.  So we have established that, at best, the work is mediocre and they like to lie about it.  Now on to the hood.  The hood was originally quoted as a $1000 correction because they would have to paint the WHOLE FRONT COWL - hood, fenders, grill, bumper, etc.  All for two ding's no larger than a plug nickel.  And $1000 is the REDUCED price because we already had the car in their shop.  Normally it would have been more.  We decided that was too much and went with Option-B: they pop the dents, wet sand the area and then blend in a little touch up paint, wet sand again to smooth it out, clear the area and wet sand again.  All for $300.  Not bad - right?  Wrong.  It looks like all they did was pop the dents.  Is still isn't smooth, The scratches are very obvious, and I cant tell that it was wet sanded at all.  I think they just let the shop lackey have a crack at it with the touch up paint you get at Auto Zone.  Had I known that this is what $300 gets me, I would have passed.  It looks Rookie all the way.  See pics I've uploaded to this vendor - they are of a red hood with the still visible scratches in them AFTER the work was completed.  I waited around to discuss it with the shop manager but he was busy and couldn't get around to me.  Eventually I left.  He did call me and offer to "make it right" but that didn't involve a discount on the work done and he wanted it back with more money to do more work.  After what had been done already I didn't trust them with any more time or money.    Score is as follows... Quality of the bumper = Three stars Quality of the hood = Subtract one star - Now two. Lies told by employee = Subtract one star - Now only one star. We could keep subtracting but whats the point?  Here is the moral of this story - If your car is worth anything to you, SHOP AROUND FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

The Summit is SOLID!  They have a variety of different menu items and serve breakfast all day.  True diner fare with a modern touch and family service from people that really care.  It is our default "Go-To" for good food in the neighborhood.  Love it here!

Kind of an upscale college dive bar.  I like lunches during the business week here.  We bring the office and have fun.  The bar tenders and waitresses don't let the fact that it's 11:00 AM on a Tuesday stop the party either - they are having fun and helping the party along while keeping us on time to get back to the office.  Food is well prepared and fresh.

I had a very complicated and intricate root canal performed here - they did a great job.  Very patient centric and they managed the anesthesia very well.  Impressive!

Officially - meh.  There was nothing bad.  Service was acceptable.  Food was OK.  We did have to explain our drink orders to the wait staff when she took our order.  Nothing complicated, but when you order a Bourbon & Coke or a Vodka Soda, the name of the beverage is also the recipe - shouldn't be too hard.  I shouldn't be training hem on how to make a Vodka Soda - Its vodka, and club soda.  I know a lot of the allure of a place like this is the skimpy dressed ladies.  They do have an attractive wait staff if that is what you are going for, but I'm past all that.  It adds little to my experience and the conversations feel a little like forced flirtation.  Really, I just want a burger and a drink with out having to conduct a class on how drinks are poured and burgers are made.

I swung by the other day after seeing in a gun forum that they had relocated.  I don't know what the old location was like, but the new location was bright and clean and new (just like you would expect from a NEW location).  Best thing about it was the people.  I wasn't there to buy anything - they were sorta on the way home and I thought I'd swing in.  The guy behind the counter was nice and spent plenty of time with me even though I told him I was just looking to kill off 20 minutes of my day.  He gave me great customer service (didn't blow me off - hey, I might be back with Benjamins next time...) and took fantastic care of two other customers that walked in while I was there.    You can get firearms anywhere but good people are hard to find these days.

I had low expectations going in but this place turned out to be a really great start to our night of Hockey watching the Coyotes play.  We had so much fun we wanted to come back after the game but they were PACKED!  Good for them.  They sell a good product for a fair price (considering the location) and have staff that still care about you even though they are busy.  If you are itching for a rocking good time, then this is a great place to kick off the evening!

One of the best independent coffee shops around.  They obviously understand the needs of the niche industry they are in very well and offer a much better food selection than the average shop does.  Very good selection, OUTSTANDING SERVICE, and tasty food brings it all together.  I only wish they could operate late evenings.  I'd like to go here for a late coffee but I understand this area of town rolls up the sidewalks pretty early - no nightlife.

Absurdly delicious!  One of the few places out west that actually does Texas style brisket and doesn't F-it up.  Great BBQ and you can tell they are committed to their craft. Only problem is that this place is so good and so small, it takes about an hour and a half to get your food - that whole time you are standing in a large common feeder line being herded into the pen like cattle.  It is a great time to chat with strangers and make new friends, but I do wished it moved a little faster.  I got a sunburn waiting for my chance to order.  Oh - and get there early to get in line, because when the food is gone, they close up shop.  Usually by about 1:00PM

Baby Kay's old location back in the Town and Country area never disappointed.  I was afraid after the move, they wouldn't be worth the huge drive to get out there.  THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE!  Same great atmosphere.  Great service and the food is as good as it ever was.  I gotta get my Cajun on about once every other month.  We will definitely be back.  Great food to try: Etouffe Gumbo Po-Boys Boiled Craw-fish (in season)

Oregano's sticks the landing every single time!  Great food.  I love the fusion of Mexican and Italian foods centered around the common ingredients of oregano and garlic!  They always have such young and energetic staff here that takes really good care of their patrons and the theme / ambiance is pure Italian 50's cheesy but very tastefully done.  Food is great and prices are more than fair.

Been wanting to try this out for some time. Maybe I expected too much. It was good but not great. Not as good as some of the other area burger joints in Tempe.   Worst part was the owner kept staring at us. I couldn't tell if he thought we were a threat (business people in business suits) or if he was looking at me with bedroom eyes. Either way it was super creepy. I also got the feeling that the employees weren't too fond of him either.

Great hotel.  You can tell due to location and original structure and shape that this is an older (mid 70's) hotel, but the McCormick (now Millennium) has done an outstanding job of a complete head to tail make over.  Very classy, clean and contemporary.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  The restaurant serves top-tier hotel food as one would expect, and the pool area is well kept.  Even though I live in Phoenix, I know I can go here and melt my stress away on a great little stay-cation.

FRESHNESS ALERT!!! All of QT's marketing is geared to have you believe that their new QT-Kitchen Concept has a chef at work bringing you freshly prepared morsels. The Have No Such Thing.   I went to order some food the other day and the lady in the kitchen brought me the pre-packaged sandwich to see if I was interested in that particular kind of bread. I was concerned and asked, "Do you have anything not pre packaged?"  Her response "No. It's all pre packaged and delivered every few days. If we don't sell it all before next weeks shipment, we toss it or donate it."  The food is very tasty. The service is very good. QT is still the king of convenience stores. But the 2-Star rating is because the "freshest" food in the store is the hotdog that has been spinning on the rotisserie rack all day. When they come clean and change their ads to represent the truth, I'll update my review.

Excellent family run Brazilian Restaurant.  They love their culture and heritage and want to share it with the community.  Service is consistently on par and the food is great.  Atmosphere is a step above nice and it feels like a very expensive restaurant but it is actually right at the edge of reasonable.  That makes it a great value and a neat place off the beaten path to bring clients and family from out of town.

Let's be honest. Who doesn't like coffee?  Well if you do, Boss Coffee has raised the bar! By far the nicest coffee shop I've ever been to.   Service is top notch. They are polite, courteous, and genuinely care about your experience.  The coffee is refreshingly not Star-Chucks. It has a smooth and easy flavor and creamy goodness to it.  Very well balanced acidity with a warm nutty finish.  Atmosphere is well above par for the area and the area is very nice. Patio is dog friendly and the views are amazing. It is a great place to hang out, get some sun, read a book and indulge in decadent coffee.   Enjoy!
