Comfortable, cool, kinda swank but not pretentious; modern place with a retro attitude. I like it! Great dark brew right off the tap. Great place to be when its freaking 118 degrees outside. Sat next to the owner, Ted. Had no idea. A regular Joe. Fun guy, great sense of humor. Just started coming here and only had the Deviled Eggs, but I'll definitely be back for the atmosphere, the cool and the vibe. Nice job, Ted.

I am the owner of ProActive Therapeutic Massage. As a business owner I pay attention to my customer's needs. Always. I have used Lotions and Potions in the past to order massage lotion for my practice. I don't have a problem overlooking the odd behavior of the service that I've received from this store in the past, mainly because it seemed to be more convenient to order from a local store than online (even though there is more of a savings by ordering online).   Today however, was extreme. I spoke to someone at 11:30 who seemed to be inept at taking a simple order for a gallon of lotion, but made it clear that I would receive a call in a couple hours from someone else to take that order. Two hours came and went so I called again. I said who I was and that I hadn't received a call back, and that I needed this order to be filled. Then I got an annoyed heavy sigh at the other end. Admittedly, I was irritated so I said that I could also order online -- and before I could finish my sentence, I heard the words, "ok, thank you, have a nice day..." and was hung up on. SHE HUNG UP ON A PAYING CUSTOMER! WTF?! I was shocked. How unbelievably rude!  I will never, EVER use this outlet again and will tell anyone and everyone to avoid this store for good.   Here's my bottom line: you never EVER treat a customer like they're in the way, especially another business who depends on your business to help their's. Bad move Lotions and Potions. Bad move.

New client here, prospective anyway. Found this place through a deal coupon. My initial appointment was for 7PM, but I wanted to change it to 7:30. Later on that night I got a message that says, "we'll just change your 7pm to 8:30...". (So wrong! You don't contact the client and tell them when they can come in, you ASK if the new time works for them. Where's the courtesy?)  Anyway, I called back within about a minute and left a message to keep it at 7pm.  I then went to some lengths to rearrange my schedule to make it a half hour ahead of time as requested so I don't get charged $25. (Who does that for people that are late? No-show, sure. I do that at my practice, but just for being late? wtf?) Today just before I was about to leave for this location, I received a message that my appointment was cancelled due to a "broken heater". The message was left only ONE HOUR before my appointment time. That sounds suspicious.  Here's the thing. The kind of work that I do is labor-intensive and I was really looking forward to a little escape. I was planning on making this a habit if it was as good as I had imagined. Yeah, sure I was really disappointed. And yeah, sure, it was nobody's fault -- if there actually was a malfunction that is, which I now seriously question. So after remaking the appointment I called them back and cancelled it. Got my money back from the deal coupon I was holding. Just a bad vibe.  I guess what really irks me is the laissez-faire, "don't-give-a-shlt" voice at the other end.  I really don't think the person I spoke to cared about the upset he'd caused, certainly not enough to offer anything out-of-the-box to make sure this prospective client becomes a client. Just a certain tone I picked up on. (Clearly this wasn't the voice of experience talking. More like the voice of adolescence.) And yeah, sure, shlt happens. The heater broke down. Fine. Whatever. But to be scooted around like a schedule item rather than asking my permission as a person beforehand (1), and then to be cancelled an hour before my appointment without any other solution better than "we'll have to reschedule you" (2), was just void of creativity to say the least. In my business, if I needed to cancel someone unexpectedly, I would have added an extra half-hour to the next session, or at least offered some sort of a credit - something other than, "we'll just have to reschedule you." Where's the incentive to come back? Do you want return clients or not? All I can say is business must be REALLY good. But wait a minute - you're running giveaways through a deal coupon vendor! Way to go...  So True REST Float Spa, please get this: THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. Give a (potential) customer the feeling that they're not really that important, even once, and you've lost them. You just lost me. Care much about that?. By the sound of the 20-something BS West clone's voice on the other end of the phone, I kinda doubt it.

I've known Stacy for years. He's one of my clients at ProActive Therapeutic Massage. As a fellow business owner I know what it takes to stay afloat, and Stacy knows what he's doing. He's is a rags-to-riches story in the making!   Having said all that, Stacy's @ Melrose is a tribute to just how much Stacy cares. This place is awesome! Kind of dark, kind of sexy without being tacky or garish or lude like so many of the other creepy bars in this town. This place is a cut above the rest and competes with another big name, Charlies (or as the gays here call it, "Charlenes" lol). And it just keeps on getting better and better.   First there was only the front porch to have a cocktail and a smoke. Then the back patio opened up, then there was a bar on that patio... and now there's food from a portable food van out back? How freaking cool is that?! The sunken dance floor speaks for itself, and the bartenders are very sweet, very amiable. For me the best time to be there is on a Sunday night, not just because of the $1 well drinks, but because of the retro 80's mixer music. Love that stuff. Love Stacy. Love the crowd. Love the staff. Good people all around.  Here's to you Stac' - cheers!

First impression as you walk into the place - HO-LEE SH*T!   Not just a typical Phoenix "rainbow" desperate-for-money, income-only, slippery-sleezy hole-in-the-wall kind of place. This place is what I would call "upstanding". I can't believe the transformation of what used to be "the above described" kind of place, to the elegant and sophisticated, bring-your-out-of-towners-in kind of place that it is now. I love it! The owner, Matt, appears to have a vision and I like it a lot! Seriously, got friends coming in? This is a place you can be proud to bring them to. Honestly, I would say this is more of an L.A. or Palm Springs bar planted in the middle of the desert.   Having said all that, here's what you get: actual stemmed wine and martini glasses with all the appropriate elixirs to go in them. Where most rainbow bars offer wine by the color (red, pink or white), Diablos practically gives you wine choices by the year. I drink martinis and I know what I like and how I like them. Most places don't get it when I order a Belvedere martini straight up with three blue cheese stuffed olives. Here it comes: freezer-cold stemmed glass with a napkin under the glass - A NAPKIN UNDER THE GLASS! (From Chicago here. A napkin *always* goes under the glass, but not in Phoenix. Why not?! Pet pieve of mine.)  The olives: not just blue cheese smashed into the olive by monkey hands, but the best BC olives I've ever had, purchased from Queen Creek Olive Mill (about an hour outside of Phoenix). The kind that melt in your mouth. Yea!  Ok so its not about the olives, the cold stemmed glass, the broad selection of wine,  booze and beer - its really about attention to detail. Detail! That's what I really appreciate. Like this is the way a customer is supposed to be treated and that's what comes across. Sure the prices are a little higher - you're paying to be treated well. What would you expect?  Did I mention that the servers - yes there are servers! - actually walking around to take your order? You won't see this at Charlies or Stacy's or any other rainbow establishment in this town. Love that too.  From the for-sale art on the wall, to the orange-scented restrooms, to the verde green paint on the patio walls to match the outlying landscape, this place just rocks. Honestly, I'm so glad and so grateful that finally somebody has stepped up to the plate to offer a different perspective on the already weather-beaten and shadowy gay community that somehow manages to live in the furnace that is Phoenix. This is truly a step in the right direction. I only hope that other like establishments pop up to compete with Diablos, if for no other reason than to be better than Diablos. That way we all win. At the moment however, there is nothing else that even comes close to Los Diablos. The place stands like an oasis. Thank you Matt, for doing this. Love the intention.
