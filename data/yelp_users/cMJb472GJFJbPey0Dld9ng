Service was awful. Food came out cold and/or extremely greasy. Remakes were so late they came after everyone else was finished. The manager even continually screwed up the tickets. NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION. Wish I could leave a negative start rating because this location doesn't deserve even a "no star" rating.

Janice, the "Greeter" that has worked every one of the four times I have been in this store, is the absolute worst!! She has specifically targeted one of my roommates when we leave simply based upon the color of his skin! My female roommate and I have mobility issues and she has been snippy and crass when we have asked about the availability of electric carts. Janice is racist and rude and is the main reason we refuse to shop at this location. We went in there this evening and left individually to "test" what we already knew; Janice watched my male roommate at the register and RAN to stop him AFTER telling both my female roommate and I to have a good night!!  Upon returning home, I called the store and the phone rang for FIVE MINUTES before I got the automated, "Your call is important to us. Please be patient and your call will be routed to the next available associate." After a total of 18:30 minutes, the system hung up on me!!

Absolutely wonderful! The food was amazing and our party of four split a veggie combo and a meat combo and couldn't finish it all. We brought home a huge carry out box full of food. We will definitely be going back.
