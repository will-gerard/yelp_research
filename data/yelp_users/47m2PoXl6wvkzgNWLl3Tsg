While conveniently a mile from my home and the guy handling the check in and out process is pleasant - my car has taken twice the time of a dealership as one of the mechanics has spent the majority of his time arguing and cussing at a woman on the phone (girlfriend or wife).  As a result, my car sits while his personal life is more important than the customer.

Let's start by encouraging anyone that has not been back since they dramatically increased the size and look of the store should make the trip.  The shop now has a very open feel with great lighting and more fabrics, suits and other accessories on the rack than before.  Same stellar service but whole new shopping experience.  I've been going to Gus and the family now since 2010 after continued disappointment in the choices, lack of right sizing and poor tailoring of Men's Warehouse and Jos A Bank.  Both of those chains would try and sell me what was not the best fit and then poorly tailor it.  One always has these buy 1 get 2 free type of sales, but they are marked up so that you ultimately pay the same for less.  At Brothers they don't play the markup game and make sure that you're 100% happy with your purchase.  I'm unable to buy off the rack for anything.  I'm 5' 8" and fit with a thicker neck and broad chest and shoulders.  Everything must be tailored.  At Brothers they order my closest fitting size in both slim and standard suits so that the alterations are minimal.  It's arrived in a week and tailored by Vickie for pickup the following week.  They really take care of their clients and the quality of work and product is the best value in town.  It's not just for the boys though - I see as many women in the store for tailoring and business attire as the men.  You must go check them out and tell them Brett sent you!  You love it!!!

I wear custom tailored suits and shirts daily; consequently, I see the staff at Malibu more than some family and friends.    5 Star Hours:  they're open from 7am to 7pm during the week.  Can't tell you how many times I've been there at open for a suit or shirt that was the perfect style/color for the day.  I procrastinate and Malibu has saved my toosh dozens of times with their early hours.  5 Star Service/Price:  the staff is friendly and the young gentleman working at the front is very pleasant. The prices are great considering the added value of their hours etc.  They have replaced buttons missing without being asked and more.  4 Star Cleaning:  they can do same day, launder and dry clean my shirts well, but they lose a star for their pressing of lapels on my suits.  They can do a better job on that.    If your office or home is within a couple miles of Malibu - there should be no other place to trust your garments.

Lived just 3/4 of mile from Whiskey River for 3 years and visited for the first time on Wednesday.    I was pleasantly surprised and will be back.  Wednesday is ladies night and 50 cent domestic bottle beers.  Yes, 50 cents.  There's a 7 dollar cover, but you'll make that up and then some on the beer.    Very cool bar and wait staff makes it all the better.  The two Stacey's and Katie were behind the bar and Heather covered the floor.  They're down to earth and fun.    The turnout and music was the biggest surprise.  I expected just country but the DJ mixed in hip hop and dance as well.  The ratio was roughly 60% percent women and a very attractive selection.    I definitely recommend Wednesdays at the River!

Friday nights are always good at Brennan's. Jackie (bartender & waitress) has an intoxicating smile - anyone would feel welcome.  The whole staff rocks!  Burgers are huge and juicy and Mexican pizza is good too.  Pool tables need a lot of work but a good neighborhood bar.

It's so easy to overlook the options on the second floor of Sears.  The optometrist there was very cool and the first of any health professional to provide me answers and solutions to my chronic dry eye here in the valley.    The staff was super sweet and helpful...one was finding me the perfect frames while I was in with the doc.  Fast service since they are hiding in a sears.  Great new frames/lenses for $30 copay in just 10 days.

Checking in to say the suite is very large with a bar, living room, free internet, a convenient sink and vanity in master bedroom.  Decor is very antiquated though for the price point.  Everything appears to be from the 80's and is wood.  A corner fake plant that might be a nice accessory if it were actually in a decorative pot rather than it's cheesy factory box thing.  The vanity in the bedroom is a nice feature but the lighting is so bad that I can't even use it to shave.  That means a woman would never be able to use it other than to pile her crap on it.  I give it 2.5 stars.

Over 45 minutes sitting on plane with no a/c along with a dozen or more planes in tarmac.  Piss poor customer service, and not even allowed to get up and move around.

I give the AZ State Fair just two stars for the following reasons...  1. I've been to state fairs in 4 different states and this one pales in comparison.  2. In a state known for heat - they provide little shade  3. There's nowhere to sit down to eat  4. There seems to be little thought put in how the rides are placed on the grounds  5. The vendors and exhibitors are scarce compared to other states  6. The agriculture or live stock is mostly rabbits and goats that are for sale  7. From a branding perspective they do nothing to promote or inform you about the state  8. Location, location, location - if you want anyone of more than low middle class to attend the fair, then hold it in Westworld or somewhere not smack dab in the middle of the ghetto  The state government really needs to put some time and effort in to turning this fair in to something Arizonians can be proud of.

For my first time staying at the W I was impressed.  Keep in mind that I am a huge fan of contemporary modern design and my own home is decorated accordingly.  The decor in the common areas are well done and I love the rooms decor from the closets and desk to the glass vanity counter tops and glass floor and tiles in the shower.  CUSTOMER SERVICE ***** I read many reviews of the W prior to my stay and in contrast to some poor customer service reviews I've seen - I received outstanding service from the valet to hospitality staff throughout.  ROOM **** The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars was the television and its in-room system.  It was glitchy, channel selection was basic cable almost, and quality of picture old school.  They provide a nice JBL apple doc station and stereo, but it's only good if you still own the older 30 pin iPods, iPhones, and iPads.  POOL Wet Deck ***** Like many old town Scottsdale spots it's filled with beautiful people.  There are two bars on the pool deck as well.  THE LIVING ROOM ***** This is a combination of hotel entry lounge in the day and very cool lounge at night with live music.  Overall, if you are a single 20's or 30's something, or trendy couple, you will enjoy the W.  What they lack in bars (outside of pool and living room) is easily overcome with a 3-5 minute walk to dozens of options.

I've always found Lustre to be a hidden gem downtown.  Came through on a Sunday afternoon for the first time and it was still a great atmosphere. Our server, Sivan, was a refreshing ginger experience.  Incredibly sweet, helpful, and friendly. She's a keeper!

Whether you want to 'play' or are serious about working on your swing and ball control - TopGolf is your solution.  The evening experience is a melting pot of the cosmic bowling atmosphere, games similar to darts, but with golf clubs.  Erin and Shawn have touched on this side of TopGolf entertainment in their reviews.  The daylight hours are a great experience as well.  Remember the old saying about mullets - "business on the top and party in the back"?  Some are there to have fun, but If you're there to seriously work on your game you will have service better than you'd receive from TCP, Troon or others  The staff are outstanding ( I've had six different bay hosts/hostesses and recommend Valerie or Victoria).   I'm there to work on my game, so the games have little value to me; however, they come in handy for when you are working on placement.    Now, here's the rub - the pricing is really reasonable for the group of 4 to 6 looking for a couple hours of entertainment.  It's not for the individual.  But wait!!!  They have memberships that you can sign up for that the monthly fee is roughly equal to playing for four hours on a pay as you go basis.  They're broken down into three types:  1. EARLY DRIVE - $80/month and you enjoy unlimited range time from 9am to noon, Monday through Friday. 2. LATE NIGHT DRIVE - $100/month and from 10pm to close, Sunday through Thursday, you can play unlimited.  Spend 2.5 hours during this timeframe without a membership would cost you $100 bucks; so, its great for good entertainment on evenings other than Friday and Saturday. 3. DAILY DRIVE - $150/month gets you the unlimited play during the middle of the day to early evening, plus a bonus of $200 in credits towards other time slots.  You won't realize just how reasonable these memberships are until you go and experience TopGolf for yourself.  Whether you are young or old you'll have a great experience!
