My advice is DO NOT live by the basketball courts or in the "A" buildings (even though it's the cheapest area and there is a reason why it's cheap). I have lived here for almost ten months and all I can say is "HOLLY CRAP" there is a lot of freakin kids. My neighbors love to smoke pot and it sucks for people who don't smoke. Kids are always crying in the middle of the night and running up and down the stairs. Teenagers are walking around in the middle of the night being loud. There was a car with a busted window so, don't leave anything valuable in the car. My neighbors down stairs are always fighting and I can hear the wife crying. If you need to sleep in the day time, FORGET about sleeping if you live in those apartments...  When we 1st saw the place they took us to the north part of the apartment which is nice and peaceful. They then told us we were in the "A" building which turned out to be a freakin zoo! Kids are everywhere with no adult supervision and the children love to play chicken with the cars! We almost hit some kids playing that game and we get paranoid when we come home. So... cheap apartment = ghetto and headaches. Pay extra money for a better place so you don't have to worry about your car nor your sanity.

I've been going to Carsten for four years and I love the students and instructors. I bring my family and friends there all the time. Sadly, I have to rate them a one star because the service at the front desk hasn't improved. Two weeks ago my girlfriends and I planned a girls day out at carsten. My student was amazing and I just love his personality. So I promised him I would bring some clients for him because I have a huge family and lots of friends. One of my friend was trying to make an appointment and she wanted to book with the same student I had. The receptionist,Isabel, was very short with her because she was annoyed that my friend was asking to be with a particular student and trying to book her mother in for a haircut and color for that same day. My friend and her mother was both scheduled at 9am. They both got there and Isabel messed up thier appointment and my friend's mother had to wait three hours to get her hair done. I was embarrassed when she called me to tell me her day was rough.  Last week, I was trying to schedule another friends appointment for a hair cut and relaxer but that all went to hell. I explained to the receptionist that I was making an appointment for a friend and could I have a particular student but she needs to start at an earlier time . I accidentally said she wanted her hair " permantily straighten"  and she snap back and said " there no such thing as permantily straighten hair! We only have a something called relaxer"... Okay I wasn't sure what it was called. So I didn't make that appointment on that day after getting snapped at. Therefore, I came in today to make my friends's appointment for the same student and the same service but this time I said " relaxer". I wanted to make it on Tuesday but the student I perfered to work on my friend's hair was booked. I told her that I really wanted this student to work on my friend because she took the day off from work to try this school out but she didn't seem to care nor wanted to work something out to make me happy. I gave up and I told her to book my friend with who ever and the earliest possible. My husband and friend are scheduled next week with Carsten but after that none of my friends nor my family will go back to Carsten. Sorry guys... I loved Carsten but since the prices are expensive for a school and the service at the front desk sucked. Therefore, I'm  never coming back.
