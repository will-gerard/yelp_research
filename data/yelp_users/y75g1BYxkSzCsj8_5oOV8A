We eat there once a week. Chips and salsa is the best.

The best sushi I have ever eaten. Staff is ok, not the best service. They seem to have a staffing issue. I never see the same staff in there other than the sushi chef.

The lady at station 4 was quick and diligent. Best manicure I've had in a while.

On my 2nd visit to the salon it was sub-par... They woman was very pushy and rude. I ended up walking out without get a service done. I won't be returning anytime soon.

White pizza is the best. Service can be slow when they are busy.

I go there because I like the tuna and Pacific Rim Riesling. Staff is ok and the music is good but really loud.
