Took my girlfriends glock slide here to have it chromed. They were extremely helpful and knowledgable about how to properly chrome/engrave her glock as to not compromise it's functionality. Very competitive pricing and finished the job twice before they had promised. Yes the front office is dirty but I did not go here for lunch. I would recommend them!

Nice course, but I recommend they go private since their Ranger makes it well known he doesn't like the public playing here. We had a group of 8 guys in town for the holiday looking to enjoy a nice round. Nothing worse than having a ranger yell at you the second you hit the turn and decide to grab a hot dog and a few beers that you need to get on the tee box. No beverage cart on the course and an uptight ranger (properly named Dick) managed to ruin a perfectly good round. If you decide to play here with the mall cop attitude Rangers. I suggest you save your money and bring your own beverages and lunch. They treat the members like royalty and the public as second class citizens. We finished our round 15 minutes before the course average pace of play.  But nothing is worse than having an uptight ranger berating your group at every hole to pick up the pace. On a side note the ranger for the front 9 was friendly and accommodating. Spend your money elsewhere.

Went to Tia rosa's with my girlfriend for a meal.... Use to be my parents fav Mexican restaurant. Decided to check it out again. 30 min wait to sit in the restaurant so we sat at the bar which was wide open. Which was understandable because it was uncomfortable, small, no tv and 3 bartenders with a lack of personality and seemed as though they didn't like each other. I have bartended for years and certainly don't expect my bartender to entertain me, but it seemed as though we were being an inconveience to them by requesting to eat our meal at the bar. After asking for a bar towel to wipe off the filthy empty bar cause my arms were sticking to it, we ordered drinks and were immediatly served with a request to pay. We informed him that we had planned on eating as well and would like to run a tab. After retrieving menus and giving us silverware he walked away only to return 10 mins later questioning if we cared for chips and salsa? I was hesitant to say no because I felt as if he really didn't want to deliver them to us. Reminding myself that since I was paying him to serve us and we did go there because we were starving I accepted his offer, as well as ordering a cheese crisp as an appetizer. The cheese crisp came out on a large pizza tin with a small taco size cheese crisp for $5. I presumed they put it on a large pizza tin so the bartender didn't have to go out of his way and offer us appetizer plates. Not interested in using the pizza tin as a plate my gf snagged 2 dirty coffee saucers from the end of the bar so we could enjoy them. The salsa was delicous and our food was really good too. I ordered the fajitas and wasn't pleased with the 2 huge tortillas I had to stuff with only meat since they were lacking on the lettuce, pico de gallo, and cheese which i had to request and pay for on the side. The drinks were very week and people were bringing their drinks back to the bar to get more booze. I myself requested another shot of tequila for my margarita. I asked for a cheap shot of silver tequila and the bartender wasn't sure what to pour so he gave me an $8 shot in my $8 margarita. So basically I paid $16 for a weak margarita.   The salsa was the best part of our meal, you would think with a restaurant full of cheap snow birds you would have thought a middle aged couple wanting to spend money at the bar running up a $60 tab you would think they would have shown a little bit of effort to accomodate us.   Next time I will wait 30 minutes and hopefully get a server who would show a little appreciation for your business. If there is a next time.

Decided to make the rare drive out to downtown Phoenix to check out a highly recommended restaurant from my friends called Cibo. I am a self proclaimed pizza connesiuer/snob and this place hit my fancy right on the pallet. Started off with the 3 pairs of bruchetta, the bread was toasted perfectly and the toppings were plentiful. Followed that up with the Diavola; spicy salami pizza! Fantastic! Fresh mozzarella, simple red sauce topped with great tasting spicy salami and cooked perfectly in a wood fired brick oven. Unfortunatly I didn't have any room for the great selection of crepes which judging by the looks at the table next to mine looked out of this world. I only gave Cibo four stars cause unfortunatly our server was a space cadet. The server assistants were on the ball filling our waters cleaning up the dirty plates and delivering the food, but our waitress failed to notice our empty cocktails, make any return trips, and offer up any desserts. But all in all I would return. Keep up the good work CIBO!

Fullers tax service is my yearly go to guys and gals for my taxes. I have been using them for over 15 years for personal taxes and my complicated business taxes. They know all the right answers and always get back to you with your questions.  Their office is conveniently located right off the us 60 and stapley, I just think they need a better parking lot or a drive thru perhaps!!! Support your local family run business and get the job done right.

Service was ok, except from the inexperienced management. Numerous complaints about the NFL games on the TV. Even though the majority of the customers were there to watch a demographic specific team the manager refused to accomodate  the cries of the consumers to satisfy his own pallet.  I know first hand how difficult it can be to set up a restaurants numerous game day programming but after a few months of walking the floor, talking to people, looking around at what type of crowd is showing up to spend money at your establishment you can get a pretty damn good idea of how to go about it. It is a week by week decision that needs to be taken into account and not something that is pre-set 2 weeks in advance!!!   Shame on the inexperienced managers for not having a clue about the demographics interested in spending money here. We should have walked out and gone elsewhere like a large handful of other customers.

What a gem!!! Not located in the best of areas but you would think they were getting ready for the President to arrive and dine! This place was spotless! The cashier was extremely friendly, not pushy, offered a sample of their homemade chicken soup while I was deciding (since it was a chilly 40 degrees outside it really hit the spot!).     I was undecided between two menu items and she graciously helped me decide based on customers feedback. I ordered the torta cubana.... It was fantastic. It would have been nice if it was cut into two pieces but I devoured it anyway.   Fresh homemade torta roll, the avocado,lettuce, and tomato were fresh! The meat was delicious! Great job guys! Great selection of baked goods, homemade ice cream, palletas, and horchata.  I will definitely be back!

We don't come here often enough. Every time we come here we need to remind ourselves how legit it is. The Acapulco philly is the bomb. Their other sandwiches are great as well. Keep up the good work.

I checked this place out after it has been open for a couple of weeks, apparently not long enough to work out any kinks considering we were the only people in there.  We went in to check out happy hour. They had a decent happy hour list. Small list of drinks and a list of appetizers for $5 a piece. I wanted a margarita (when in Rome) I figured since their drink menu had a frozen house margarita on happy hour it wouldn't be a problem to make the switch to a margarita rocks. Guess what?!! Margarita rocks is not on happy hour!!! What?!! Really? Besides children who drinks a frozen margarita? (sorry if I offended anyone) The bartender did make a pretty good margarita though.  After reviewing the happy hour list of food, I asked to see a full menu. Needless to say, I was unimpressed with their menu! Awful, 90% of their menu was appetizers and salads, with a small amount of a la carte items in the bottom corner. Really? That's it? Food was bland, the salsa was ok, service was mediocre to bad. Can't imagine I will return for a retry unless it is still open next year. Feel bad for whomever dumped a lot of money into it's decor and location. Good luck papi chulo!!

We were excited to check out this new restaurant! We were left extremely underwhelmed. We sat in the bar to watch MNF. It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a "sports bar". It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretary's day the place was empty.  The bar area managed to fill up, because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well.   Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience can't fix. The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.  We ordered the pumpkin margarita. I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food.   I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.    Queso dip: cold Habanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not bad Guacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites. I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered. Fail  Chicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks. Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken. Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry. My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF.   Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar. Needles to say our drinks were empty, our plates, monkey dishes, empty bowl of chips, 2 cups of bland tortilla soup, saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them.   Onto the Entrees:  I ordered the carne Asada steak.  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter. They were delivered by TQLA manager "Joe". Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food. He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly. Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust. Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair. Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees.   We dig in:    Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor.   Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?  Where is the heat...? Bland  I hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way. Never saw Joe touch any tables, never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool. Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.  This is about the time that our appetizers, chips, soups, and entrees were all removed from the bartop. FYI Joe, the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own. You don't have to stand there and hold it up. Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot.

We just had our small wedding reception in one of their private rooms! With the help of Denise everything was top notch! The food and service was phenomenal! The chopped salad was a big hit as well as the churro bar for dessert! Such great flavors and everything came out quick and fresh! The small private bar was convenient to have within reach! We would highly recommend the staff, the food and the ambiance for any social gathering! Thanks again Denise and staff for a job well done!

Garbage. Pre cooked meat in a non working steam table. Confusing choices. Grocery store tortillas. My tacos were ice cold. So if you are in the mood for some tasteless cold tacos this is the place for you. And to top it off their fancy Coca Cola dispensing robot only dispenses water and tea. So if you would like to wash down your cold tacos with a nice refreshing draft soda..... Forget it.
