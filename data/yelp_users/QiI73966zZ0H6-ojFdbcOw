Pastrami sandwich is awesome. I will have to return. The place is tucked away and out of sight. Service is good and fast.

Super friendly service. They went above and beyond to get the ties we wanted to gift for the groomsmen within a few days and out of state.   They have really good friendly stylists and recommendations. It was a one stop shop for him. They gave us 40% off coupon for shoes in February. They had awesome buy one get one deals for slacks. Then they gave us a credit of $500 after the wedding to buy a suit. Done. Done and done.

I just had a horrible experience there.  I've been to this place a few times before.  Never really impressed but gets the job done.  I just happen to have a hankering for pho since it had just rained.  Rare event and rain causes me to think of comfort food, which pho definitely is up there on my list.    I come in, sat down, water served and barely glanced at the menu when I sh!t you not, the guy (I think he's also the owner) comes to my table and said something maybe like "Ready?" but it sounded more of a grunt.    I had just happened to look to see that the #7 was what I wanted.  I ordered rare beef pho with meatballs.  He then takes me menu right off my hands.  Um...I was going to take a look at the spring rolls, but ok, I guess I didn't really care for that.  I'll just sit here and sip my water, without a straw, which I would like if someone would come by.  I knew I wasn't coming here for service.  Why is it so rare to have good service in Vietnamese restaurants? It must be a tall order but at least smile dude.  I guess that's what I pay for.  And then a cockroach walked across my table!  Eeew!  I shoo'd it away with my napkin, looked around to see that no one paid attention.  Ok, I won't make a big deal.  I just want to eat and go back to work.  I noticed when I looked around that there was a couple in the corner looking across the room for service waiting for their bill.  They don't know you're supposed to pay at the register, without getting the bill first.  Then 2 guys seat at a table besides me.  They were handed their water and menu almost immediately after sitting down.  hmm prompt service....seconds later dude comes over to grunt.  He just sat them down.  One of the guys looked at the other and chuckles, he wasn't ready to order yet, they just were settling in.  OK it  was not my skewed perception, he really wants us in ready to order.  Then the roach came back around.  I'm done with this place.  yuck. The guy must've eyed them because once the guys put their heads up, boom there he was again, "ready?"  My pho came and I ate it quickly, hungry, don't want to think about it.  Pho was so bland and disappointing.  The bowl was small for $7.50.  Upset with the roach more than the horrible service and food.  Went up to register to pay and darted out of there, never to return.  In and out in about 10-15 minutes.

I love this hidden diamond in the rough.  It's been around for over 20 yrs. There's the Tempe Firehouse across the street and a new apartment complex in construction off Apache and Elm.  I love the chicken schwerma plate and sandwich like everyone else who commented.  So much so, I bought the spice they sell in their grocery side of the building.  They do it so much better.    It's always packed during lunch time.  I work close by  and find that it is just as fast to go there and order my chicken schwerma sandwich to go, without a call in,  as it does for Jimmy John's sandwich to arrive, which is only half a mile away.  Haji-Baba wins, hands down the better sandwich and better price of $3.89.  This is usually true if there are not people waititng in line to pay for their shopping cart full of groceries.  How does that happen?  The aisles barely fit 2 people in it.   Anyways, if you've never tried it, you're in for real treat.  It is also a great place to buy spices, olive oil, lemon juice and try new things.

Tough to find but worth the effort. It's in the shopping center just south of Tempe Marketplace. The pizza is very tasty and the service is good.

I would give this place 5 stars if their service is consistent, but it's not.    Many places try to be what this place does well, asian fusion. Authentic flavors and good prices.  This is my go to lunch spot.

I've been here many times more than I've checked in on yelp.  I miss the wait staff I've grown to love.  Turn overs here seems a bit high, but the food and service still remains wonderful.  The best item on the menu is the grilled wings.  Best wings you'll ever try.  Since they're grilled, no messy fingers, just yum!

Sooo good!  Try the macaroons and the big weekend breakfast! You will not be disappointed.  I haven't been there for months but when I'm in the area, it's either Scratch or the Breakfast Club for me.

They must have done something different bc we were blown away by great attention to service. For that I give it 4 stars. The food, it's bar food, predictable. Service is the best.  I wish I had remembered our server's name it's not a common name but we did ask for the manager on duty to give her recognition. It's refreshing to feel so welcomed right from the start  followed through with positive attention and follow up for the delays we had with our food and drinks. It cannot be perfect every time but the attention to our time here made it a good experience.

This is my bf's favorite barber shop.  He went through a few places before finding this gem.  It's quick and friendly service.  Phil closed his shop in Queens, NY and opened this one.  If you want the NY barbershop experience, you have to try this place. I just sit on the very comfy couch, read some magazines and admire all the bobbleheads decore. It's such a manly place.

The best happy hours with plenty of yummy options to choose from. I'm definitely coming here more often. The service is very good and attentive. We were approached by an opening of the door and greetings. She went to clear out a table and while waiting, we were approached soon after again. Great service. Food came out warm and delicious. Ribs, grilled shrimp, sauteed mushrooms, geogia Sun tea and moonshine margarita were all good. Will be back

Crappy service. Switched masseuse from an experienced one to an inexperienced one in middle of massage without notice and then continued to charge the same even though dissatisfaction was shown.

Always great food especially the beef and bbq chicken.  Clean.  I really like their steamed vegetables and rice. Not a fan of macaroni salad and theirs doesn't change my mind. I'm a regular lunch diner. So far the service has been good.

Friendly staff, clean decent atmosphere but I'm from Texas and the food did not meet my standards for good BBQ. Not to say it's bad. The meat was tender but I'd prefer Dickey's over this place. The favors were off. The sauces were too sweet for me, the Mac and cheese had pasty cheese, and the rice was a bit too dry and bland.

Delicious tacos, good queso, 2 types of salsas: roasted and cold and the best part is their amazing beeritas! Such a good deal. Love this place but too crowded on Taco Tuesdays.   Ps. I hate the patio chairs. They take too much room and are tough to move around as needed in the cramp space

Love the moist turkey burger and arizona burger. The ghost chilli paste is no joke! Its sweet at first but it sneaks up on you. The Sneaky Diablo is spicy without the ghost chili paste, so get it on the side.

Our dog, Dom  black cattle dog/lab had a blast there. He played the entire time  and was knocked out when we took him home. We were given a written report when we picked him up and a photo of his smiling face when we were away. It meant a lot to us, we will definitely come back, he seemed to really enjoy it. We boarded 1 night to try it out  and glad we did. My only concern was the powerful pee smell, but dogs are dogs he must have rolled around on it bc he brought it back home, so an immediate bath was given. I still give it 5 stars bc he had a great time.

This place is a hidden gem!  You cannot get live honky tonk music like this anywhere close.  Did I say LIVE music? yes, I did. We went there on a Saturday night, I guess the weekend it opened. It is next to the Scottsdale Comedy Club, which by the way if you have not tried, must go!.   The place is small but they had a full bar, nice d√©cor and great service.  So it won me over.  Must try the Texas Frito Nachos.  so good.  the hush puppies lack flavor, but I'm not a fan of hush puppies in general. My companions liked them, then again if you're drunk, anything fried is good.    They have a small dance floor in front of the stage, so bring your cowboy boots and start two-steppin!    The only criticism I can make is the place is small and it would have been nice if there was a patio to get away for some air.  I'd go back to enjoy the live music, drinks and try out their menu which is quite good in price.

I forgot the repairman's name but he did a great job. I called around: Bob's TV Repair, Sear's, and M&M. I was looking into either replacing the power supply or replacing the mainframe in our tv. He diagnosed it and found a way to solder new connections and fixed the existing mainframe for a quick and cheaper route which I appreciate. Now our tv is as good as new. I was bracing myself for a $300 replacement fix but repairing fix was $175. $45 to come diagnose the issue that would go towards the payment. He was in and out in about an hour. I'm a happy customer.

Get the breakfast croissant sandwich with bacon and cheese. It comes with a salad and hash browns. Very good. Best hash browns in town bc it has french spices mixed in it. No ketchup needed. Yum!

My favorite Zipps location. Great location right off Mill Ave.  Lots of television screens.  Great patio for people watching the crazies off Mill Ave. And since I live within walking distance, well biking distance, it's my favorite location.

Awesome bar. Awesome games. Good drinks from awesome mixologists.  We got to roll a dice for a chance to win a fee appetizer.    Games, yes the video games..my bf really liked the selections.  Many ppl were enjoying the games and drinking high end cocktails.  I gave it a 4 bc I didn't really try the food.  Just fried mushrooms appetizer, it was decent.   We decided to check it out when we spotted a new spot where the Bamboo Club used to be, 2nd floor overlooking Mill Ave in front of the Handle bar.   Will be back.

The place lacks the atmosphere and warm service I was hoping to get. The food was decent. We had the beef fajita. First set of chips and salsa were complimentary. It was a decent amount but not that amazing to order a refill.

After going through some other local bridal shops did I realize what a sub par service I got. Granted that at the time they were going through construction they could've done a much better job. I'm surprise to see a high rating considering expensive price and my experience. So here goes.  First off they did not offer us water in the middle of May. Very limited selections, lace I found is very popular and they only had a handful. They may have been short staff or somethingI don't remember but I had an appointment and we had to wait to get service.  I had a 8month pregnant friend with me and there was no restroom available. So she was told to go next door bc they understand that they were under construction.  Well they didn't understand why she would be told that, so she went to a nearby restaurant, again, no public restroom available but she finally found one down stairs portion of the building.   I found better service and selections at a nearby boutique called Lillian Couture, although I ended buying somewhere else.

Amazing!!  My husband and I decided to try this place out after we stumbled upon it from a walk we took while eaiting for a table at the Breakfast Club. I'm glad we did.   It's healthy, delicious and in good portions. This is my new favorite breakfast joint. I definitely will be a regular.

Thank you Yelp for steering us towards this place! I wanted authentic Lao food on the last day of April to commemorate Lao new year. I was leery of trying a place that claims to have Lao food because I've seen many that have tried and failed due to the complex dishes and foreign ingredients. But this place did it right! Good job!  The service was very friendly and attentive. I believe the owner is also the cook. She genuinely cared about how we enjoyed our food, presentation and experience.   We ordered the papaya salad, spicy pho, and my favorite dish, nam pork! Yum!! It was the right amount of spicy kick and the flavor was strong and memorable. So good!
