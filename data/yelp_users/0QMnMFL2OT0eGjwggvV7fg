I don't think that we will be back. The chips and salsa were good but that's about it. My chicken enchiladas had the chicken on top of the rolled tortilla with cheese. That just seems plain lazy to me. I was really hoping that it would be better.

I LOVE this resort!  I have stayed there many times and never been disappointed. Truly a paradise in Paradise Valley...beautiful rooms, friendly staff, fun bar (and funny bartenders) yummy cocktails and food, not to mention the amazing views.  Can't wait to stay there again.     Oh...and the Spa Suites have outdoor soaking tubs, perfect way to end the day.
