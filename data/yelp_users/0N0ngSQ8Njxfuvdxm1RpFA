We visited Majerle's to kill some traffic time leaving downtown. I came with no expectations and only wanted a drink and some downtime to cap off the evening. Well, this was accomplished! And well might I add.   We sat at the bar, were greeted prompty and served politely. Both bartenders were personable and efficient. The crowd around seemed upbeat, business casual and relaxed. Decent, though not overly crowded scene for a Saturday night.   The menu looked diverse and varied drinks available. Decor was clean, modern, and comforting. Prices were on par for the area and venue.   Really not a ton I can comment on as it was one drink (It really was, too!). No, not "two", TOO!   Seems like a nice place to relax when downtown. Would I drive here just for Majerle's? Nope. Would I pop in if downtown wanting a drink or some food? For sure.

I shall write this review mainly for the manager of this station. Now I feel like a complete asshole because I can't for the life of me remember his name. Shorter, middle aged, ultra friendly gentleman with glasses and pulled back long hair. He knew everything I usually purchased, always asked how my day was and was extremely helpful! He even would carry heavy items out to my car for me without my asking (Ice, giant boxes of beer...ya know...)   This station is on a busy corner. Has some homeless people around generally (never had a problem, though- they seemed to keep to themselves). Gas on par price-wise with other stations. Large selection indoors.   The Mexican food restaurant in here is awesome, too. It's so random. Their burritos and nachos are really tasty! It shocked the hell out of me, as I wasn't expecting much. I wish they stayed open later. Closes after lunch, so don't get too excited when you come in craving this and they are closed by the time you get off work. Boo.   Kudos galore for service, Chevron! Thanks for always being so friendly.

Holy panic inducing layout! Shelves up to the ceiling, cramped isles, no organization, and few price tags. I almost walked right back out the door, but pulled up my big girl panties in went into the trenches.  I came to find a specific set of sheets a client of mine had that were soft silky and comfy. Well they didn't have them. In fact finding a king sheet set anywhere was rough. I grabbed some shams and a set of sheets  and checked out very fast. The checkout lady was really sweet. However there really wasn't anyone else around to help me find anything.  The sheets I bought suck and I would be more comfortable laying on a bare mattress. Open up a little! Offer some organization and breathing room. I would have returned the sheets, but would have had to pop a Xanax first to walk back in there!

What a surprising little nugget this was! We did take out (menu online), so I can't comment on the inside of the restaurant. Yeah, I waited in the car... Didn't see a point in both of us going in.   We got home and WOW! First off the portions are huge! I was starving and barely dented my meal. They had 6 veggie options. I opted for the orange tofu. It was so fresh and cooked to perfection. Also had red chili peppers and broccoli. Perfect amount of sauce, tons of tofu, awesome flavor, tender rice, and even great presentation in a to go box! Topped with an orange slice and all. The chicken lo mien looked great as well and the husband enjoyed it so much he's now hating himself for eating more than he should have and curled up in a big stuffed ball.   Great prices, diverse menu, friendly staff (some language barriers present, so speak slowly), and just yummy.   Added a star for having varied Veggie options as well.  *They deliver

I like this Big Lots! I mean, it's a Big Lots, so I really don't expect it to be immaculate, all that organized and not be crowded. They do have more organization here than most and the employees look like they work really hard and are always pleasant. This location in particular has a HUGE section of kids toys that blow other places out of the water price wise. They are current and brand name toys, too. The grocery section sometimes has some gems (name brand juices and juice packets, candy, you name it). I mainly come for the cleaning supplies. They are half the price of competitors and usually just some scent or packaging that got nixed for whatever reason from larger stores. They also have a massive card section. I have seen there is a furniture and home section to the left when you walk in that looks really nice and big. I haven't gone to that side, but probably should. The parking lot is big and spacious.  Give it a try! You may be surprised and your wallet will sure thank you!

I'm not sure how the hell I have lived in this area so long and never been here! Maybe because Cave Creek Road can be be such a cluster F of so many businesses I never noticed it.  Sure is a fun place! There is a large bar where most people sit and then tables around as well. It's bigger than it looks. Varied crowd with mainly your "biker crew". People from all walks of life seem to come here, though. Friendly crowd and great people watching.  It's older. Nothing fancy. They have pool, darts and a bartop video console. Some of the bar stools are rickety and make me feel like if I have one too many cocktails I might end up of the floor from it tipping over!  Happy Hour is from 3 to 6, not 3 to 7 like some sites claim. Good deals at that time. Beers 2 bucks, wine 3 bucks, and well drink specials as well.  The menu is big and varied. Decent prices for sure. Large portions. My only turnoff was ordering the bean tostadas and when they came out the beans were ICE cold. I mean they actually has small ice bits. (The rethinking of this is making me want to barf a little). I explained this to the bartender who didn't seem to think it was too odd, but she sent them back and they came back out perfectly. My friends had the tacos that looked REALLY good. Only a buck fifty a pop on Tuesday's, too!  They have nightly karaoke here and comedy routines on Tuesday's, which is really fun. This bar has a nice feel of people just enjoying drinks and a good time.  Another downside can be the "burning out/racing" of the bikes in the parking lot arriving and leaving. The tire smoke gets in the bar and makes me feel like I need an Oxygen tank and an inhaler.  I recommend stopping in here for some drinks and food. The service isn't outstanding, but they do keep your drinks full and will check on you frequently.  I plan to keep coming back often.

One would typically think that going through a drivethrough may somewhat insinuate someone might be eating in the car! Hub ordered a chicken sandwich (plain, only cheese), myself, 3 small sides (corn, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese). We are told this will be 17 dollars!? Wow! So this starts a car fight of how this can possibly be so? So, when we get the window, it's actually 13. Okay, that's better. As we pull off to head to our event for the evening, we open the bag to find there is no fork, no napkins, and  his sandwich is the absolute farthest thing from "Plain". Sauce ran off the wrapper into his hand. Crap, if only we'd had a napkin!? If you come here check your order well, and if planning non inside dining, bring your own silverware and napkins! Or swear and run across to the Fry's deli across the street for the items.

My first "6 star" review goes to Flowerama.   Let's start by saying I was hesitant to choose Flowerama for our wedding flowers based on their signage. Yeah, I know. But lure me in...! However, let me tell you fellow readers, ignore the building and GO IN. It's well beyond worth it.   I met with (unfortunately  "former" manager Shannon) who had worked there forever and really knew her stuff. She was so amazingly knowledgeable! I'm no flower expert, but I know quality. I set up an appointment for the next week for my husband and I to sit down with her to place our order. (Lucky girl, huh? Most future spouses steer clear of assisting with flower duty).   We arrive and she is ready to roll. Has the books set at a cozy side table. Now, I have odd requests. I'm not what one would call a "traditional" person. We wanted to place an order for table flowers (3 tall per vase per table) for 30 or so tables, and bouquets of wildflowers as a gift for all female patrons at our reception with our vows (from a song) tied around them. She knew everything in season- what would work, what wouldn't and how we could arrange them.   *HERE comes my 6th star: I wanted 7 flowers per bouquet. Well, my flower knowledge was lacking more than I thought, because this would have cost more than my dress! So what does Shannon and the Flowerama staff do? Talk me down to 3 gorgeous flowers that tied up in absolute beauty with the EXACT look I wanted. That's customer service, folks. I would have paid the initial amount without hesitation, as I wanted them to be full and pretty. Flowerama saw my vision and made it happen saving us almost 1,700 dollars...without me even asking how to decrease the overall cost ! That's a "personal" level of service I have never seen.   Thank you SO MUCH for going the extra mile. Every single flower was in mint condition and gave me tears. A wedding day is a big deal and I had ZERO stress over the breathtaking flowers they provided.   Talk about a company who really does care.   I just called to verify information and spoke to the owner David Jones to verify name information for this review. What a stand up guy who does truly have down home values and a passion for customer service. They have proven it isn't all about the money.   Thanks for being honest and not trying to "make a giant profit" off someone trying to make a day so special. For listening to what we said and making it happen.  (I will post pics when able from a different computer)   "Little girl I have found love, the kind that old folks all speak of. And no poet can dress it up with fancy words. It is patient, it is kind, it forgives and it is blind. And it cannot break no matter what you've heard"  -Levi Lowrey   (Tied with raffia around our perfect bouquets)

I used to drink a lot. I mean, I still do, but I'm not in my 20's anymore liver! I shall wrap up about 70 trips here into one review. I used to live in quite a short stumble distance from here, so I frequented knowing I could avoid a DUI and always have a good and safe time.  There are so many positives. Let me add that this and the (other former Brennan's East of here) are quite different. Yeah, this is in a strip mall, as a ton of bars in AZ are. There is no outside seating. There is a lot of indoor seating- booths and tables galore as well as a large bar with extended seating. For some reason the booths to the left side of the door seem to be made for either children or anorexics. The rest seem just fine!  It's a little aged, clean enough, older place. They have darts, pool, shuffleboard,and bartop games. I have never had bad service here. Honestly. The servers and bartenders are attentive and motivated.  The menu at this Brennan's is huge! If you can't find something you like here I would be shocked. Let me tell you they sure don't skimp on cheese. Order anything with cheese and you shall see. The mozzarella sticks are the size of cucumbers! A word of advice: Share a meal. The portions could feed 6 people (unless an ala cart choice).  Trivia on Wednesday's for cash and Sex Trivia Saturday's for sex toys! Who can resist that?! (Hey, put your cell phones down- no one likes a cheater! Yeah, you!)  Prices are great as well. Happy hour gives you a good bang for your buck.  It's a fun, local type bar that always felt safe and welcoming. Used to feel like "Cheers" to me. Too bad I can't stumble here anymore, but I still visit often.  Never had a bad time and if I were a fly on the wall, I'm sure I could write a lot more here. :)

We hit Greenway Village on a Sunday afternoon after running some errands. Awesome dive in the strip mall plaza. There is a really big rectangular bar with a sweet young and cute bartender. Pool tables around, jukebox, darts and even Wii.  It's bigger than it looks from the outside. Fun crowd. Seemed like mostly locals. Lots of beers on tap, multiple types of hard alcohol. They didn't have wine, so I had a Bud Light and it was tasty. Draft beers were 2 bucks, which is nice.  This was about what I expected! Fun place for sure. Nothing that really makes it stand out per sey, but we will be back at some point to enjoy a nice cool beer.

This SNY seems smaller than most to me, and maybe that's what seems to make it better. The service here is always top notch. I honestly don't know how they do it, because it consistently only looks like 2 people are working! The guys at the front serve, answer the phone, do takeout and cashiering! They are super high energy and always seem to be in a positive mood. The cook(s) do seem to take pride in the food they put out. It can be a little slow at times, but I find it well worth it! It's not some lukewarm, been sitting around slice of pizza. The food here is really good. They have huge side salads, awesome pizza (giant slices), and free breadsticks when you dine in. It can be a bit costly if you don't order from the list of specials. Keep an eye out for those and they often have coupons as well. If you call for delivery, be forewarned it's usually at least an hour until arrival, but again, worth the wait!

RJ's surprised me when we walked in! I was expecting it to be far more of a dive! It's actually quite nice with tables, a bar, and a back area with games and sometimes live music. It's pretty loud at times, and nothing really fancy about the big open room. They only had wine one of four times we were here, but I guess that's to be expected. I figure they could at least keep some of those tiny screw cap bottles for when people request. I settle for beer, which is averagely priced. The service is friendly enough and pretty fast considering the bartender always seems to be the server for the entire place. The food here is surprisingly really good! I get grilled cheese, which honestly is one of the best in the Valley. All of the food looks good. It's cheap in price and comes in a basket.  RJ's is a fine little stop in. I upped the rating due to the food. No patio here... Just a back door with 2 broken plastic chairs and a dumpster.

Yum! We had a mail coupon for buy one entree get one free, so figured what the hell and gave this place a try.  It's located in a strip mall, but certainly doesn't feel like it when you are inside. It has quite authentic decorating, is clean, and VERY welcoming. It feels like being in a family restaurant with a cozy feel in Mexico. We were seated instantly. We had the best service here I have EVER had. Not exaggerating. Jovan was our server and was amazingly fast, efficient, friendly, and motivated. Our drinks were always full, food was out in a flash and just how we had ordered it. He was amazing. Always smiling- all of the customers appeared content and relaxed. Onto the food here- spectacular! It seemed quite authentic. It was hot, great flavoring, and the menu is large and diverse. They give chips with 3 types of salsa that were all very different, but wonderful. I saw quite a few people order the "fajitas for 2", which were huge and presented well.  I really highly recommend coming here for lunch or dinner. Comforting feel and absolutely perfect service.  I have still been raving about it.

I may be one of very few who actually LOVES PPP's pizza. I don't know what it is, but it is really good. I think it's the sauce, and partially the cardboard-like crust. This location is really big. We usually get take out, but the last time I came with a friend on a day off and we had a blast! We were the only people there (well it was a Tuesday at like 2pm) and we had beer and wine an probably spent 60 bucks on game tokens and went to town like we were 5 again. The staff was very friendly considering we probably seemed a bit ridiculous! We had an awesome pizza (I always get cheese, but the toppings others get usually look pretty good). We won a ton of tickets and got all kinds of crap we will never use and gave most of it away!  I have to say, I never knew getting a good buzz and blowing a ton of money on random (some half working) games could be such a blast! Clean restaurant and bathrooms and they were even washing germs off the games with spray.

I'm much more a fan of the Olive Garden than I used to be! We had a very nice experience here. We came for the "all you eat pasta, salad and breadsticks for $8.95". Service was quite fast and very friendly. I had a glass of wine and hubs a draft beer. All of the plates, glasses and silver seemed newer and more sparkly than prior.  The portions are pretty big, so the all you can eat aspect ended up being one helping of each there and a helping to go. They actually put our second pasta right into to go containers with fresh new breadsticks and bagged it right up.  I felt kind of like a cheapo getting the second to go, but they offered to just do it that way without us even asking! We accepted and had a great lunch the next day as well!

Well I most certainly was not expecting to fire up a 5 star Denny's review on a Sunday night, but that's the beauty of an open mind, right?  We headed out to QT to grab some wine and gas and were contemplating a dinner to go from here. We haven't showered today and layed low by the pool in attempt to do "nothing" before the busy week ahead. Our options were limited due to our appearance, so we figured Denny's would take us!  They sure did. We rolled right up and saw a Redbox right outside the front door, which had us pretty happy. Grabbed a couple flicks and walked in.  We were promptly greeted with smiles. The place smelled great! Like those little air fresheners you plug into the wall that mimic Grandma's house. It was clean as a whistle, restrooms and all.  Our server, Dallas was amazing! My soup was out before I could even check into Yelp on my phone. The husband had a 6 dollar giant breakfast and myself a 4 buck grilled cheese. Dallas wrote nothing down (amazing considering my odd sides and requests), our food came out hot, perfect and fresh. Refills were prompt on our icy sodas.  There really was nothing else we could have asked for.  Who knew?!  *Saw they are doing a charity benefit for the troops June 12th, 2011. 10 percent of your bill is donated. They have up some nice American decorations and some stories about local service members.  *A new menu is also expected to launch on the 7th, so keep an eye out.

We have been here quite a few times and have always had an absolute blast! The Bad News Blues Band is our favorite, but I hear all the bands are really good. They even have hip hop nights, which I would assume would be pretty interesting. This isn't you "typical" hired band place. These groups fit this place perfectly and have some awesome original material.  Char's is SMALL. Arrive early if you want a table. The charm of Char's is that they haven't really updated anything. The tables are old, the bands stand on the floor, and the decor is aged. Normally, this would bother me, but in this case it just works. It keeps the "feel". There is a patio out front and usually you can have some nice conversations with the band members on their breaks.  There is lots of dancing to the music and upbeat feel all around. You can hear laughing and just look about and see how much fun everyone is having.  There is a cheap cover at the door (expected considering the live band). The drinks aren't cheap, but won't break your wallet too badly.  It's a place I think everyone should experience. Let your hair down, go and have fun. It is VERY loud, so don't arrive expecting to have a lot of conversation, because it ain't gonna happen. (Maybe good if you go with someone you don't so much enjoy talking with :)).  A true staple of midtown Phoenix.

Calling this an "Irish Pub" or "Sports Bar"  might be a stretch... But I will let it slide due to the awesome diviness of this joint. They do have a HUGE selection of cheap tap beers, all kinds of various liquor, and basic wine. It's a "park in the back" run down looking bar that gives you a slight feel of uncertainty when getting ready to open the door. I'm sure glad we did, though! A dive for sure and mainly male patrons. Lots of seating, dim lights, and some good country music playing on the jukebox. They have a massive "outdoor" patio, but it felt like we were still inside. Reminded me of an Arizona room. Spoke to a couple nice, layed back fellows and felt safe and comfortable. The drinks were cheap and cold. The bartender's here kick ass! They are funny, sassy, fast and efficient chicks. Impressive for sure. They seemed to know everyone by name, their drink of choice, and what happenings were going on in their lives. Onto the food...Yum!!! I had a stellar double decker grilled cheese that was hot and cooked to perfection. The hub had wings and loved them.  Our tab was cheap, we heard some hilarious stories, and will definitely be back! I honestly didn't want to leave due to having such an unexpected blast. Don't let the neighborhood or outside exterior intimidate you. Well worth taking that deep breath and walking in the back door for a fun night.

This is just overall a great place! It's tough to do this review, as I can probably only remember 1/2 of my times being here, and that is being generous.  There's something about the atmosphere here that just makes you want to tie one on and knock back giant beers and spend money playing songs, darts, and Golden Tee. They also have pool and other games.  It's a BIG bar. There is a more "game side" and a more "table/eating side". They have a ton of TV's that are large and high quality. I have never seen it "slow" here. It seems no matter what the day or time it's pretty happening!  The food is really good. I love the diverse menu, happy hour specials, and quality ingredients. I also have never once had bad service. The staff is fast, friendly, and has never seemed irritated or overwhelmed.  There is a large patio out front that you can drink on that has misters and heat lamps (depends on the season).  This is the absolute perfect place to go have a blast with friends, or even come alone when you feel the need for a night out. Always friendly, attentive, and..... oops I forgot the rest because I always end up giggly and drunk. Sigh.

Chase Field really is my favorite stadium in AZ. I shall always refer to it as "The Bob", though this shows my age quite a bit. The stadium is clean, modern, has a diverse selection of food/drinks, and (yep) air conditioned at times. I feel this is one of the few things Arizona has really done well in terms of sports. They updated the team uniforms, entire stadium, logo, etc a while back and then updated the stadium to match. The bricks, flawless lawn, retractable roof, large size and friendly staff make it tough to say anything bad about it.  Now....WHERE ARE THE PATRONS/FANS? There were about 18,000 on a Friday night, which a staff member told me was "a great turnout". Wow, because the place felt a bit like a ghost town. There were so many empty seats that I felt as if we were 6 hours early for the game or something. I understand a huge percentage of people that live in AZ have come from other states and tend to follow those particular teams. However, this was just sad. Perhaps management/owners ought to consider some more family specials, charity tickets, or groupons to fill this great stadium up and build a stronger fan base... after all, the Diamondbacks are fighting for 1st place in the division at this time!

I love you FEZ! If I wasn't married I might just move in with you. This place has "it" down. They have the wow factor and keep it going. The menu is diverse and has some really different items that are fantastic! They are vegetarian friendly, too. I love going out and having options. Happy hour is stellar (both food and drink specials- 2 for one or major discounts). We fill up on appetizers usually. We've always had great service and the waitstaff are FUNNY!  This is a very "gay friendly" restaurant, but you always will find a diverse crowd here. Priced as it should be, great ambiance and clean.  The dining room can feel a bit cramped at times, so I recommend the loungy area to the back, the bar, or patio.  Thanks Fez, you have never let me down.

Z Pizza has my favorite salad of all times! The Pear and Gorgonzola. It's SO good, I highly recommend! The pizza here is good, too. They don't skimp on toppings, and the crust has an almost sweet flavor to it. I would give them 10 stars for food (when they get it right). We have had some incorrect pick-up orders a few times and sometimes the food is different. Like they forgot some of the stuff the dish or pizza is supposed to include. This location is super small for dining in, so I recommend doing take out or delivery (although they have a very small delivery radius). The other Z Pizza's are good for dining in and even have beer and wine. Cost is average- ask for specials. They also have an online "Z-tribe club" that gives you a free small pizza for signing up and other deals via email. If you just want to try it out, sign up for the club first and you have nothing to lose! The kids that work there are nice enough, but can be a little slow and always seem stoned to me...

I hate you Ikea. Yep, I said it. I have given it a few tries and every single time is makes me even more angry.  First of all, navigating this beast makes me want to take a pen to my eye and sneak shots in my purse. Secondly, they can't get anything correct! We came THREE times for one light fixture that was broken or didn't work when hooked up each time. We bought 2,000 bucks worth of cabinets and the "handwritten ticket by the staff, pick up downstairs method", got us 4 different colors and models for the same kitchen. After the second trip for THIS screw up, we requested a manager who simply said "remodeling sure can be tough". Yeah, especially when Ikea can't match a model number. BOO 5 million times over. Between the commute, traffic, and complete crap of customer service, you can mark my words we will never return.

This PF Changs has such a classy feel to it. I felt relaxed and really enjoyed the ambiance. The new munu is much easier to read and has a nice flow. We just missed Happy Hour, but it looks like there are some really good drinks and specials! We sat at the bar, which was really clean and we had spectacular service from Brian and Ryan. I like how they write the batender's names on a card so you know who they are. Seemed to provide a more personal touch. I had wine, hubby had beer. Nice, clean glasses. I'm glad they have Veggie options here! Had coconut tofu, which was perfection. The oolong seabass he ate even looked good to me! It was on a bed of this really good looking spinach, cooked just right. We were too full for dessert, so didn't have any of that. It really was an awesome dining experience. The noise level, lighting, and decorations were just perfect.

Who's a sap? Not this girl... But I will dedicate my 50th review here. Why you ask? I got engaged here! The pool and rooftop patio are the highlights of this establishment. The deck uptop has an amazing city view. There really isn't a "bar" persay. More like a tub of drinks. (Have cash). The tables are sub par, but they have fun plants with colorful  orb lights and the ambiance seems to create itself. Better hope you can hike a few stairs, as the elevator caps off a floor too early. The pool used to be free to locals and is now 10 bucks per person, per day. Bring your own towel. You can drink at the pool and it's gorgeous. Fun and bright tiles with starlike lights under the water, a light water cascade, and music. Comfy seating with couchlike beds or these odd sling chairs that are surprisingly cozy. There's also a huge hotub (that was engagement place). Also had my bachelorette party here (I shall not post pics of that). Gallo Blanco (the hotel restaurant) has some cheap tacos if you get hungry, too. Item costs vary and it's quite an eclectic menu. The drinks are for sure overpriced with light pours.  We have stayed in the rooms and they are okay. The hotel basically reminds me of a halfway done house remodel. Don't stay here if you want something ultra fancy. The doors are labeled with license plates. It all just seems like a start to something that keeps that downtown feel, but is trying too hard to be fancy. A bit hipster, really.  Clarendon is an odd gelling of superb and work still to be done. Its small and mimics more of an apartment complex than hotel. Come with an open mind and don't miss the sunset. This place will for sure always hold a special place in my heart.

Typical AMC.   I'm not really a great person to review theaters because I don't get the appeal. I prefer my Netflix and Redbox. Cheaper, I can drink, watch on my own time, eat whatever I want and lay on my couch! So I don't "theater" it often, but sometimes you just gotta do what ya gotta do!  I guess in teen days it was fun. Maybe I should make out next time we go and see if that spices up the theater expeience ? Oh wait, that's more fun on the couch, too!   Anyhow.   Onto this AMC: It was a Monday night, so pretty quiet. They had a lot of staff just standing around. They were nice enough. Sounds like the bathroom situation may have improved, because they were clean. The seats are indeed awkward. Especially when you are super short. It's like every curve in the chair was the opposite it should be against my spine. Yep, the entrance is hard to find as there is a sneaky little hallway from the parking lot. There are lots of places at Desert Ridge to eat or drink before or after. The sound was good.  The concession stand is of course overpriced... I get so mad paying 5 bucks for a soda! Come on now! I did, though, so I guess they win there!   I wonder if a concession boycott would work???   So, as far as movie theaters go, it was fine. Nothing spectacular, nothing horrible.

Valle Luna is no doubt one of my top 3 Mexican restaurants in AZ. I find myself craving it at times and nothing else will do! It's an older restaurant with few updates. The parking lot is an absolute nightmare, and we usually end up parking on the street to the North. The service is okay- seems to vary depending on day and time. The food, however is so delicious that I just have to give this 4 stars. I could probably just come and eat chips and salsa and be completely satisfied. They are delish! The menu is big and varied. I'm a bit limited being a Veg, but the beans never disappoint. The rest of the food all looks wonderful and fresh. It seems a bit costly to me at times when compared to other similar establishments, but I seem to forget that when I'm in the place eating!

If I could buy everything I ever needed at Walgreen's I would. It's fast, in and out, short lines, and I always buy way too much stuff I don't need when I come. Maybe that's a downfall, but they seem to place items that appeal to me in obvious zones. Way to go Marketing Department!  Most people are pretty darn familiar with Walgreen's, so I will post the particulars of this location. They have amazing wine clearance sales. 10 dollar bottles for 2, 20 plus dollar bottles for 6 or 8. They must be clearing out inventory, but seriously these deals are great! They seem to clearance out other liquor as well. Check the front displays of the liquor section and each are labeled with a yellow discount price tag. Haven't had a bad bottle yet! Check out at the cosmetics counter if you buy any makeup or personal hygiene items because they archive manufactuor coupons and just scan them for you. Review your receipt as well because they add a savings on that for your next visit (around 3 to 5 bucks off).  Friendly staff and everything you need (and don't need!)

Guess what? Sterling wines on sale: 3 bottles for $10. This is a spectacular deal. Just don't go buy them ALL or I won't share such tidbits anymore. ;)

I know. It's Del Taco. But it was so good. I'm tired, hungover and not in the mood to sit in a restaurant and be around people today. Our drive-through order was perfect and error free. They gave us lots of napkins and a mountain of Del Scorcho sauce. Food was hot, fresh and just what we expected. Now I can nap with a full and happy tummy.

I only came here to get air in my tires since the warning light was on. It was fast, free, and the customer service was excellent!  The tires on display looked quality and competitively priced.  Discount does always seem to excel at service and cost.

Well Carolina's is just freaking yummy. It's so good. It's also so cheaply priced! The menu is varied, the take out is fast, and the staff is friendly. They have a salsa bar and varied soda machine. I have to knock a star off for the inside "dining". It reminds me of a school cafeteria. A big room with old tables that remind me of card tables. They also play strange Christian songs when on hold for takeout. Be advised they are closed on Sundays. Give a call and do some takeout. The food really is great and they certainly don't skimp on cheese and other ingredients.

Bangz is the only place I go for my hair! The salon itself has a very hip, cool, chic feel! They have lots of craft items and salon products available for sale. Some really interesting ones. They aren't pushy to make you buy them either. The prices are about average for a salon of this caliber. Well worth every dollar! The dyes are so shiny and natural looking, the haircuts phenomenal, and the staff attends courses/workshops to stay modern. They suggest something if you ask, and give very honest opinions. The quality is so great I can actually go a few months between dyes and trims. The people who work here are all so friendly and personable. They will take walk in's if they have time. I recommend making an appointment, though. They see both males and females. I see Sally, whom I cannot praise enough. What a doll! They all seem good, though. I VERY highly recommend checking this place out.

We had a lovely evening here. Yes, it's the symphony, so expect some mellow music, older crowd, and drinks at intermissions only. Show up on time and behave :).   Our experience was the "Paul McCartney" tribute. The first half was all Orchestra and the second, Orchestra with a Paul coverband. Odd? Well, yeah, but it was a great show. I felt like the poor Phoenix Symphony got left in silence for the second half. There was a glass barrier placed and the cover band plugged themselves more times than there were outlets in the entire building. I wanted more Orchestra. Oh well. It was still good, but I could have seen this portion at Casino AZ on a Monday or something.   Onto the building... It's really one of the nicer ones downtown. I have big love for the glass chandeliers and open layout. They kept the "old', but also upgraded the furniture and carpeting. It does feel classy and a bit majestic. Clean and classy.   I did feel as though the Orchestra was a bit too "crammed". The stage was packed. I wouldn't be able to breathe, let alone sit next to someone playing an instrument next to me. They did it well, though. They all remained poised and professional.   The building, ambiance, and musical talent made this a great evening. It was comforting and inviting. Allowed for relaxation and a romantic date. I would highly suggest making a trip here to experience what Phoenix has to offer. Our arts are so important after all.

I can only comment on the food and delivery here, since I haven't been inside this particular location.  The delivery was fast (under 30 min) and everything was just as I ordered. The pizza was hot and really quite delicious. Soft crust and the perfect ratio of cheese and sauce. I also had a salad that was fresh, crisp, and had lots of toppings (crunchy croutons, chopped onions, finely sliced mushrooms, fresh green peppers and cold dressing on the side).  It all really hit the spot and I was impressed by every aspect! I recommend giving it a try for the quality and freshness.

I like Switch a lot more than my husband, but oh well he can write his own review. :). We have been here a few times (would be more if he enjoyed it more).  I really like the decor inside and little back patio. Maybe it's the wine lover in me that has this place on my list of likes (damn, is it 5'oclock yet?!).  They have a GREAT happy hour. Happy hour wine specials make me feel so warm and fuzzy inside. The wine list is extensive and they have appetizers that nicely pair with the wines.  I have always enjoyed the food here as well. The menu is diverse and there is pretty much something for everyone. I like curling up on the front couches and talking, relaxing, and enjoying the lighting, candles and people watching.  I would LOVE Switch (and so would my spouse) if the service was better.  The last time we came they said "It just got really busy, so we can seat you, but no one will be with you for about 20 minutes". Well...okay. I appreciate the honesty I guess. So we ask if we can grab a drink then, and are told "No, it's too backed up at the bar, too". Well now you have made us pretty upset, because I love my wine and don't appreciate being denied that drink I have been waiting all day for!  So since then we have not been back, which is too bad. I think if you catch it on  a slower day  you will really enjoy yourself. Stick to happy hour, too. Slightly overpriced for what you get otherwise.

The Rose and Crown and I used to have something special. I would arrive, have a nice glass of wine and relax on the patio. Maybe my perspective back in the day was jaded by some lovely evenings with a cool breeze and great conversations- therefore not noticing what was actually going on around me.  Well- this was all shattered last night. So listen up management as I would hate for this bar with so much potential to come to a close due to a multitude of fixable issues. Especially in downtown, as I am a huge fan of the area and root for the businesses here... If they give a small ditch effort for me to do so.  Whew, onto the nitty gritty. We walk into quite the scene of disorganization. We had a large group so didn't mind waiting for a table. Hubs and I wait on the lower deck as my brother and his gf sit upper deck so we can grab a table (no list to be sat, etc). We hover by a tree and talk to another nice couple having a drink waiting for a table at Bianco. A waitress (I'm feeling nice so she shall remain nameless) walks by and says "it's busy and you are in my way...haha... But really I'm not kidding". Um WTF!? Where would you like us to go? The planter? (and yes we did stand in the planter and now my shiny white shoes for the summer are covered in dirt and scuffed up).  So while standing in the planter we notice some tables to the side of the patio. Long bench tables and ask about them. We are told they are "broken". Well freaking fix them or move them then! What a ton of lost business by not throwing a few more seats out there.  About an hour later we finally get a seat. Now mind you, I still have not had a drink as neither server who knew we were waiting for a table offered one. That's again, money lost management, as in this hour I would have at least had two.  So Ms. Friendly "get out of my way" ends up being our server. She obviously hated her job. She was slow, rolled her eyes at bringing us water (sorry it's a freaking 100 degrees outside), and obviously just wanted to go home.  To add to this not so awesome experience we sit on the bench of the table and it breaks. Now mind you, we are not overly large people by any means. So we figure out some seating plan where no one gets stabbed in the ass with a wood sliver by balancing our weight. What does our server say? "Oh yeah, that table is broken". (Thanks for the heads up) I get a glass of 13 dollar wine in (yep, and I think it was Glen Ellen) and think to myself I will just make the best of this. I go in and ask if they have dessert. I'm told no, they are out.. I ask if they have anything that might be sweet or somewhat resemble a dessert. No. It's my brother's birthday and I think everyone should have a birthday dessert or something to make it special. Rose and Crown apparently doesn't think so.  If I could give them 0 stars I would. I guess they can have the mandatory one star for the cute kitty that was playing around in the back that they feed and care for. Hope that little kitty doesn't like dessert! :)  Steer clear until these issues are fixed unless you like piss poor service, falling on the ground, dirty feet, and overpriced drinks.

This makes me sad. I'm such a Parrot-head and saying anything negative towards Buffett just makes me want to shed a small tear. Unfortunately I'm rating Margaritaville and not Jimmy, though so here we go.  The atmosphere is fun- the decorations cute and it's a very large restaurant. It also has a very overpriced gift shop out front. They also have people in stilts walking around making balloon figurines, which made me feel a little awkward. Also the servers just aren't ever very friendly. This last trip, we had empty drinks, stacked plates, waited forever for our check all while 5 employees, manager included were standing right behind us chatting and watching football. Customer service is not a priority here folks.  I've been here about 5 times and never have I really enjoyed it. This last trip will however, be my last. I'm done trying to wait for it to get better. We didn't have to wait as long as usual, which is rare. There usually is a long wait time, but we generally come before some event so Westgate is packed anyhow. We were sat in some weird corner booth upstairs and were facing a corner wall and it was hot as all hell. We asked to move and one would have thought we asked for a million dollars, but our waitress finally agreed. Once we could breathe at our new table, she finally got our drink order and it took forever to get them. My glass of wine was the smallest glass of wine in the world. It was about the size of a shot. I also ordered a soda and it sat empty the entire dinner experience.  Our salads and food came out together- after about 50 minutes. The table was really crammed since it all arrived together. I didn't particularly want my salad after that long and didn't eat it because the entree seemed more appealing by this point.  The food was OKAY. That's the only reason for the second star. I had mac and cheese and the husband the "Cheeseburger in Paradise". He had wanted the "cold draft beer" to go with it- but they have NO draft beer. They did have Heinz 57, which was at least fun.  The prices here are extremely high. WAY too overpriced. Almost 60 bucks for mediocre food, small drinks, rude service and an overall lackluster experience.  Sorry Jimmy! We won't be back, but will look forward to seeing you in concert if you ever come back to AZ again. It's been a while!

Due to being a Vegetarian, the pure thought of In-N-Out used to make me feel a little unsettled and queasy. I mean that's a LOT of meat being pumped out of one chain. I digress. Anyhow, I got dragged there and boy oh boy am I glad I gave it a chance! I had a grilled cheese that has now become my Valley favorite. It's delicious! Has lettuce, tomato, house dressing and perfectly melted cheese. They even cook it in on a "meat free" surface... (I watched). The fries are also tasty as can be. I used to think they were too floppy and soggy, but they have crispied them up a bit.  There is always a massive line of cars at this location, so be prepared to wait a little while. The people work incredibly fast, though, so it always amazes me how fast the line moves. They have a smile and are friendly. Keep an eye out for tips or search their website for non-listed menu items and styles.

Bombay has done an absolutely fabulous job in menu revisions lately. Being a Vegetarian, it is a fabulous place! There is a tofu or potato option available for all entree choices. There food is also extremely low calorie and healthy. It's so darn good, though that this seems to be untrue! (but it's not). I never feel overly full or stuffed. They have awesome wine specials (20 bucks a bottle for a large variety of tastes-some high end) and some couple's nights deals comparable to most restaurants (20 buckish). Happy hour specials look awesome, though end before I'm off work and head out.  I minus one small star for service. Seems mildly slackish at times and not customer centered. It's a small establishment, so I unfortunately cannot blame a busy server/bartender. At times the service does seem aloof. However, if you love modern music, fabulous Indian food, and a wide variety of wine, come hither. It's a great place I feel is trying to improve and I applaud the option of Vegetarian dishes and all low calorie, body happy foods. Kudos Bombay!

The place has a really cool ambiance and feel to it. The decor is modern and chic. They have live music on weekend evenings (usually jazz-like) and it is HUGE. I have never seen this place even 20 percent full, which is kind of sad.  The food presentation is very nice and it tastes good, too! They have some happy hour and late night appetizer specials, too, which are varied and yummy. The sweet potato fries and chips and dip are 2 of my faves. The service is a little slow, which always throws me for a loop considering it's never crowded when we are there? I usually have to ask for water about 3 times before they actually bring it... So I knock a star off for this. Also for the fact this place can get really expensive if you have a full meal! Better hope you are somewhat rich, or it's payday!  Onto the the main highlights! The wine flights! And beer flights! They are ginormous and have a great selection. The wine "flight" pretty much gets me drunk. Everything here is "American", so if you like some type of non- American brand booze, you are SOL. Besides the wine and beer flights, the drinks seem grossly over-priced, though. Stick to the flights!  I always recommend this place due to the location (bottom floor of the newly renovated Sheraton), decor, varied menu, swanky ambiance, and flights. Perfect place for a first date, any date, or a nightcap.

I'm pretty sad I don't live as close to here as I used to. I'm sure my waistline is happy, though!  America's has delicious bean burritos! The beans are creamy, cheese perfect and wrapped up in a very fresh tortilla. I hear the Carne is really good (But I obviously haven't tried it). Salsa is okay. I like a little more spice, but I guess at the temp it is I am able to load more on a chip without breaking out into a giant sweat.  We usually did takeout, but the inside is cute. It's incredibly tiny as well, so I recommend the patio if you eat here unless you like people waiting for to-go orders standing like sardines pressed against you while you are trying to eat.  The menu is small and limited. They serve beer. The prices are good.  Give it a try! It's not the kind of place you go on a date to or plan an evening for, but for lunch or a quick dinner on a busy day it's perfect!

Hanny's is great. I love seeing these local restaurant's do it up right.  This is a converted old department store named "Hanny's". Hey, what a good idea for the name!   It's clean, hip, spacious and fun. I'm a sucker for a fresh flower and candle on my table, too. I once said if I lived in a giant warehouse-like house, this would be exactly how I would decorate. The seats are chic and even recline. It shocked me at first and I thought the booth was broken. There are two floors and a staircase up to a DJ stand on the upper wall. Cool. If you want the pants scared off of you go check out the old elevator shaft to the back with a glass bottom. It's a good time! The bathrooms might be the coolest part. Trust me here and hit them up. They are like little clean airplane lavatories! There are some tall mirrors and seating upstairs that remind me of a fun-house. I've never seen anyone actually up here, though. Maybe we just don't hit it at "happening times". The action seems to be more downstairs. Huge bar in the middle. Tons of room, and quite professional and friendly service.   The food is really good. They have a variety and Veg options available. I like the pizzas (2 people can share one if you have a moderate appetite) Drinks are good, too. It's all a slight bit overpriced, but I'm okay with that as they do serve up quality.   Prime location, diverse crowd and really like nothing else in the valley. If you are downtown looking for food or a drink, this is always my first suggestion. Now run along and play!

Hey Senora! Thanks for saving my dog's' life. I can't not give you 5 stars for this.   I have been here twice. Once, the poor little guy (a puppy at this time) ate a dead bird and developed Pancreatitis (a really bad and almost fatal case), secondly in a pain crisis due to a hip fracture.   Are they expensive here? Hell yeah. Unfortunately most emergency vets are. They compare price-wise to other competitors.   Are they skilled? YES. These doctor's are smart. They listen. They don't do unnecessary testing. I feel very confident in their knowledge base.   Are they caring? Absolutely. They hold the pets, talk to them, let me bring "blankies" and toys, and truly listen and support the owners and what we are saying.   I have trust in them. When it comes to my dogs I'm pretty damn picky.   *Remember to adopt, not buy. :) Lots of little loving animals out there looking for a happy and loving home. I recommend Petfinder for seeking the perfect "match". That's where my big, sweet boy came from.

This place pretty much sucks. Been forced to come here twice due to the lines at the other restaurants and bars at Westgate having over an hour wait. We didn't have to wait here and I can see why! People know better than to come. Calling this place an "Irish Pub" is like calling my Chrysler a Porche. There isn't one Irish thing about it, except they serve Guinness. Big whoop! Almost all bars do. The service is terrible and everyone seems to have a major 'tude. Gee sorry for interrupting your social time of you chatting away with your buddies on the staff. The food is average in taste I guess. There were ZERO veg options so I had 3 sides, which was interesting. Everyone else's food seemed okay, except for my husband who ordered honey medium wings and they were making ME sweat just sitting next to him. He suffered through them, but was for sure not what were ordered. When we mentioned it to our server she basically gave us a blank look and did nothing. We had quite a few drinks here before a concert thinking it would save a little money from buying 11 dollar beers in the arena. How wrong were we!? Plus, they ran out of pint glasses and had to use plastic. The place was maybe half full? We split our check in half for the 2 couples and my mouth hit the floor! 75 bucks was HALF!?! For 3 sides, an entree, 3 wines and 3 beers. Just...wow. Lastly we were in this awkward table that lined square up to the server station, and made me feel really claustrophobic sitting inches from this giant awkward wall.  I read in some reviews this place turns into a club later at night! This made me LOL literally. I can't even imagine. Save your money and pride and stay the hell away from here. Seriously.  I have to say, the management must not care. 99 percent of these reviews are horrible and nothing has been done. Oh well, guess they will learn when they shut down, because I can't imagine that's far away!

Well if you like gay bars and live in North Phoenix, here's your place! Rainbow Cactus has been Marly's (sp) and Taylor's Tavern prior. It's a bit divey. It REALLY needs some new carpet, bathrooms, and patio furniture, but hey we are in a recession, so I get it! They have a huge drink selection that is averagely priced. Darts, pool, skillcrane, an ATM, and a jukebox. The staff is always nice! They used to be cash only but now take debit and possibly credit cards I do believe. It's in a creepy complex with a Taxadermy shop and doesn't open until 3pm. Mainly regulars are here and it's typically kind of slow unless they have a drag show or karaoke. It's a eclectic little place for sure. There is only one toilet per sex (which isn't enforced) and the bathrooms are in big need of some updating. They do keep them clean, though. The back "patio" is rickety, has an odd jumble of old furniture and you can't drink out there. I think the new ownership by Karen has helped the bring some life back into this place! Now if it could just make enough dough for some updates!  They serve some snacks like bags of chips, but you can bring in your own food and there is a pizza place next door that will bring food over as well. This is a fun, neighborhood gay and "gay friendly" bar that just seems to vary each time I come. You never know what might be going on! Props to keeping events and shows going and being the only gay bar in the area!

Well after being a frequent flyer in the younger days to the N Scottsdale Teakwoods, I had to check this one out. I think I heard my liver scream when we walked in due to prior Teakwoods days!  This location is strip mall located, though doesn't feel like it when you are inside. It's roomy, has a positive vibe, and I still enjoy tossing peanut shells around!  We went during happy hour and the the hubby enjoyed some 2.50 pints. I had wine, per usual, but it was only 5.50 a glass not on special, so hey, that's okay. The food is a little pricey, which is why I knocked a star off. 7.50 for pretzel strips and very watered down cheese seems a few bucks too much, and 8.50 for basic meat free nachos seems steep too. It was all good, but I was starving, so who knows.  Mainly post work business crowd. Some games scattered about, a medium sized screened in patio out front, large TV's, and clean restrooms.  Our bartender, Sarah was awesome. She was attentive, obviously great at her job, cute, and never seemed behind or flustered. Our food came out accurate and fast. Thanks Teakwoods for being close and giving me some much needed Friday booze! Happy hour appetizer specials would have upped my rating. Advice: the portions are large, so share one. We had a ton left over from 2 apps, so save some cash. Nachos are basically a soggy mess if you are hoping for hungover leftovers!

It's like the shopping equivalent of the joy Disneyland brings me! Hobby Lobby is FAR more then just "craft supplies". They have tons of home and holiday decorations, unique selections, yes crafts, but a lot more as well. (cushions, candles, a large card and party supply section, etc).  It's far bigger than one would think. It's also very well organized and clean. If you want to find something fast, the store is well marked and the staff has always been very friendly in assisting. If you feel like browsing, you can do so without feeling rushed or cramped.   *My absolute biggest piece of advice and the reason for writing this review is to let you know about the 50% off sales they have daily (usually one week per section). This varies from department to department. If you ask, they will even tell you what "section" is coming up next. It's amazing, as their prices are already better than Michael's, Target, etc. They even do this with holiday decorations before the holiday arrives! If it's not 50% off yet it will be soon.   Keep an open mind and take a look. You will find things here you never expected!

I was so sad when I thought this old gem had closed down! Then so happy it had just moved.. and closer!  I don't find this building as charming as the old location, but they did bring everything along that was there and set it up in a fun way.  Service is ultra friendly. The place is clean and has nice high ceilings. There is a patio out front, parking in the back.   It's a little difficult for me to rate the food, since there really are no Vegetarian options. They made me a grilled cheese upon request that was good. The entrees and smells here do seem really great. The food always looks quality. Yes, it is expensive, but I think the higher end cuts and reputation justify that in my opinion.   They have happy hour with good specials and a cute sit up bar.  Overall a couple of great experiences. Not my highest recommendation for Vegetarians at ALL, but I wouldn't really expect this to be a real veggie-like place. My husband absolutely loved both of his meals (steak and burger).

What a posh, fun, hip place The Lounge is! Chris is awesome. He knows his shit, is nice to talk with, and can make any type of drink you could want. He's confident and it is quite obvious he enjoys what he does and takes making the place as great as possible quite seriously.  We didn't eat, but looked over the menu and it looked really good. A nice variety of foods and drinks. Slightly overpriced, but not too bad. Happy hour seems the best time to come.  The decorations and decor are a fun mix of class and hip. We felt really comfortable and enjoyed the relaxed feel. The pics Yelper's have posted are very accurate and depict the ambiance very well.  *Perfect place for a date.  Can't wait to head back and try some of the other drinks and have some food.

I hear Primebar is closing, and I sure hope this is a big horrible rumor.  Now, don't get me wrong. There are things I can't stand about this place, but we will get to those.   *Come for happy hour!!! They have amazing drink specials. I love the 5 dollar glasses of wine. It's a long list of GOOD wines. All of the other drinks are really cheap at this time, too and they keep a diverse list of specials. They also have extremely cheap (around 5 bucks) and delicious appetizers. There are some little tables by the back bar that are cozy and romantic. The back bar usually has the post work crowd sitting around it. Overall a good feel. Not too loud or bright. We get great food, drinks and service for a real deal. It's conducive to conversation and relaxation.   Well, unfortunately this is where the magic ends. Evening comes and with the strike of the clock welcome to your "typical Scottsdale club-like scene". At least it's a bit of an "older" crowd. Not the 21ish clubbing dancing crew. They have live bands that are good, dancing, and it gets pretty darn crowded.  Problem is the prices all of a sudden triple, the service disappears, and the entire scene changes! You become surrounded by lots of plastic surgery, skimpy outfits, and men flashing their wallets. (Time to pull out those bills for the now present bathroom attendant!) If this is your deal and scene, you would probably love it! Reminds me of Barcelona back in the day. :)   If it's not, come for happy hour. It's fabulous for that! Then, as soon at it ends, pack on up and get the hell out!

This review will be slightly skewed, as I only had dessert here. We might have had more had we been greeted at the door and offered a menu or a smile. My husband and I walked in to check drink prices and considered bringing our group over to their very charming patio. This restaurant is very clean, appealing and has a lovely atmosphere and decor.  So we waited for a bit for someone to talk to us and when no one did, we grabbed a menu ourselves and checked out the selection. Quite a nice wine list and variety. Somewhat pricey for a birthday drink-fest, though so we headed back next-door. As we were walking out, a server said "oh you're leaving?". Well, yes we are and no one even noticed we were here.  Part two: after being denied dessert next door I came here to request any type of dessert to go and would pay whatever it cost. If it was up to Greg at the front, this would be a 5 star review. He sounded confused and unsure, but did check and was friendly. He said the chef didn't like to make it to go, as the presentation would be off. I understand this and know they take such pride in product, so I explained this would be okay, I would certainly take into account this isn't a typical presentation and appreciated them doing it. I then ask if they have a candle. I'm told no. I ask what those small flickering tea lights are and am told "a candle". Yes, unconventional, but what can one do in a pinch? So Greg gets one for me. Thanks Greg. So now I'm pretty happy and waiting and a server, possibly even manger by her demeanor walks into the kitchen and loudly says a disgusted "REALLY?!". I hear them talking about what apparently is my awful request for a to go dessert with a tea light for the birthday boy. After ranting and rolling her eyes she walked out and pretend smiles at me. Puh-lease.  Greg hands me the dessert (no fork, but that's okay) and I gladly pay my 7 bucks while also tipping him 7 for being hospitable. The dessert was vegan and incredibly tasty. It actually had French fries that tasted like gummy worms!  Sorry Nobuo. If I hadn't gotten mocked we would have for sure been back for a romantic dinner and some drinks soon.

I will rate and review this as a non-cigar smoker, so please take this into account.  This is a hidden gem at the new "Talking Stick Resort". Don't know it's here and you probably won't find it. Tucked over to the right, middle of the Casino is Shadows.  *We would have never found this place if we didn't get a comp coupon for drinks. We tend to get these often, so just ask if you throw some money down on a table game. The managers and Pit Bosses have them. This entitles you to any complimentary drink of your choice. If you get some- GO HERE. The booze selection is far better than any other bar in this Casino.  I always order a very rare, fine Chardonnay, and husband orders a prime Scotch. We have been here on mainly "slow nights", and have had some great talks curled up on the couch listening to a Jazz band, or chatting with some out of towners about the best golfing in AZ.  I can see how this can be hit or miss. The outside patio is OK. It's a little awkward with oddly placed walls and TV's.  I think if it were to be crowded here, it would not at all be the positive experiences we have had.  The Cigars and drinks are amazingly overpriced, so bring your own cigars and buy liquor from the other bars and walk in with it if you don't have comp coupons. Unless you win a big jackpot, in which by all means come whoop it up.  If you land here on the right day at the right time, I do think you will enjoy the chill, layed back feel, where you can have good talks and relax. (Or sit and wonder where the hell all of your money went so fast and drown your sorrows with some smoking and alcohol).

I can't stand this place, but seem to end up dragged here for birthday parties. Maybe it's the Saturday night crowd that makes it so awful. I'm not sure, but every time I come I leave pissed off and broke.  We usually rent one of the "cabana's", which really isn't worth it because it gets so crowded you end up with a bunch of random people all in your space anyhow. They also grat your check at 50 percent. YEP! Our bill for the 3 of us (yes they did split checks after throwing a fit about it) was $120.00. We had strictly beer and wine. After looking closely, the added on tip was $59.00. We never saw the server again, so we signed and left. I hate it so much here anyhow, I would have payed every last cent in my checking to get the hell out of here.  The staff is slow (though they are way overworked) and rude. The bussers and bouncers like to say "get out of my way". (Real nice).  I guess it would be fun here if you like getting "totally wasted" with a bunch of less-than 21 year old's trying to hook up and pull some sub par dance moves on the tiny inside dance floor (which you step up to get onto and people are always bailing on the stairs). So I guess if you like watching drunk people falling you should stand here!  It's just crowded, messy, rude, and reminds me of Spring Break in college seeing how drunk and obnoxious I could get in Rocky Pointe.  No thanks. Next time there is an event here I will try to plan a dinner first and skip out on "all the fun to (NOT) be had" here.  Maybe it's better on a slower weeknight, but I honestly don't care to find out.

Big Guys has done a fine job making a "strip mall bar" a potential favorite. Service was fast and friendly. I did not eat, but friends did and the food looked and smelled high quality. Drinks reasonably priced and good pours. Eclectic crowd... Though gentle mannered and quite a bit of fun! Bathrooms were clean and uncrowded. Flat screen TV's had a variety of events. The open atmosphere and overall cleanliness had a welcoming feel. The tables, however were mildly sticky with paint.  If you like a non-"clublike" bar with a chill feel this place is for you. Good crowd for a Thursday and seems to fit "all walks of life". Have a pint of a great beer selection and cheers to ya!

Dodey's has a crowd of just about everything one can imagine! We were lured in by the "girls in naughty costumes" sign when this first switched owners. We are next door having dinner and figured we couldn't pass up seeing what the heck was going on. There is a long bar and basically 2 sections to the bar. Nothing fancy. Pretty much your typical diver, but a bit cleaner! Service is friendly and Dodey and her son seem SO very dedicated to keeping the customers, happy, safe, and entertained. The jukebox is new and usually playing a good variety. There is pool, darts, and sometimes they have wii going on the flatscreen. No food is served here, but SNY is next door and they will deliver for free and you can eat right at the bar. The drinks here are DIRT CHEAP. Our bill has never been more than 20 bucks and I typically leave slightly faded.  Dodey's is a fun, safe, almost odd little pop in place for a drink or four.

Hooray! We finally made it here for lunch. It felt as though we were in Downtown Phoenix again due to the hip and locally owned feel. I wish there could be SO many more places like this in the neighborhood. The building is small and charming. You can certainly tell a lot of love and effort were put into making this establishment a success.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Have soda's, Italian soda's, coffee, tea, beer, wine and hard liquor. It's small inside with about 6 tables and a bar with seats around it as well. Cute dog friendly patio with umbrellas outside. Multiple Veggie options available! I had the Veggie-Tarian sandwich and it was great. Seems like they have varied menu options and special dishes that change from day to day. The ingredients were fresh and quality.  32 has done amazingly with a concept that is very difficult for restaurants... To excel at ALL 3 meals, keep up variety, have a spectacular coffee bar, innovative menu, and now have a full bar as well.  There is even a drive through window!  I felt right at home and cannot wait to come back for some wine. The wine list looked extensive and varied.  Keep supporting local and get here! It's amazing. I kind of want to live in a little loft above it.

Pet Club has many selections that other more "common stores" do not. They have more varied brands of natural foods and supplements that my dogs absolutely love.   I first came in because I do like to support smaller and more local businesses. The staff is very friendly (not entirely as knowledgeable as I would like, but they will look things up and find out information for you). The store is clean, though a bit warehouse-like (I guess like any pet store).  The prices are slightly higher than I feel they should be, but they do have a "buy ten get one" on almost all products. So this eventually pays off pretty well.  I specifically like their natural medicine section here. It's quite varied and my dogs have gotten relief from the products. Mainly the "Natu-joint" liquid to be placed over food (high quality glucosamine) that got my dog walking again. If you have an older animal, or one with sore joints, come check out their medical section. First isle to the left ;).   Sign up for a pet card (They just write your name and file it and check off when you come in), and have a look around at the different products available here.

Dr. John Williams and Cathy Guinan, NP are the practitioners I see in this office. Being in the health field, I know educated, and spectacular doctors. Dr. Williams might be one of the nicest men in the world. He has a caring approach, remembers names and faces and would seriously do anything for his patients. He has his private practice here, works for Hospice of the Valley, and also is the main doctor for a large local Assisted Living Facility. He is not only a very intelligent man, his heart is gold. He provides that more caring feel that seems to be lost in some Physicians nowadays. Cathy is just as wonderful! She listens, takes her time, asks questions, and doesn't "lecture". These two do not make you feel "badly" for lifestyle choices and make you feel so comfortable. It's very important for me to be able to be honest with my doctor's, so I can get proper care and treatment. You can do that here! They take the time to really listen. The front desk staff is pleasant. The office is old, can get crowded. No updated furniture or fancy ambiance... To me this doesn't matter. The quality of care does, and what you get here I just cannot compare to anyplace else.
