Wow! Great little hole in the wall place. Great prices and the food is damn good. Had the country burger and fries with a lemonade sweet tea. Just great. I will be back!

The Lamb Gyro is good, great flavor. The batter on the zucchini is nice and light. If you work in Tempe this is a good place for lunch. You can order on their website and they will have it ready when you get here.  The only downside is they have Fox News on the TV. Lol

I have always enjoyed this place. The atmosphere is great, the staff are great and the food is great. If you come see if you can get Hiro as your chef, amazing...

We started going back in 2011 after my wife had a traumatic brain injury. They helped her a lot. Dr. Amin is amazing. Combined with the staff and Kathy out front helping with getting the right frames for you the experience is just phenomenal.   I can not give this place enough stars to show how much I love going here.

I live this place. Has great food and very friendly staff. We not only get the delivery but we go there as well. Usually pretty empty with customers but they have great food.

Save yourself some money do not go to this "steakhouse", they have no clue how to grill a steak. I ordered the Logan steak medium, it came out medium rare. Fine, I can deal with it, i didn't finish it because it just got to chewy. My wife ordered the 6 ounce Filet, medium. It came out rare. They took it back, re-fired, now, not only is it now medium rare but tastes like charcoal because it flared. One piece of Filet ruined.   Manager took it and said she would get a new filet, butterfly it and make it medium. She came back 30 seconds later and said it should be out in 5 minutes. Well that's a huge red flag since medium takes around 10 minutes. So it came back out, there was blood pooled on top. Wife cut into the edge and it was medium rare. I cut into the center and it was raw.   The people running the grill have no clue. I asked if they had thermometers and the manager said yes and I looked in her eyes and told her than they aren't fucking using them.   Never going back, EVER!!!  We are now at Chilies across the street to get my wife her favorite half rack of Dr. Pepper ribs.

If you're looking for sub standard food, steak not cooked right the first time and when you send it back it comes the exact same way, service that doesn't write down what you want as sides or takes forever for drink refills than this is the place to be.   I understand that this is a chain resteraunt and the level of giving a crap about your customers is low but I'm still spending money...
