I eat lunch here a few times a week. You can't beat $5.40 for a bowl of soup and bread. The food is always promptly delivered. The one time it wasn't, management offered me a giftcard for the extra long wait. Top notch service.

Worst management I have ever encountered. Zipps is one of my favorite restaurant and my boyfriend and I frequent the one on Camelback and the one on Mill. We decided to try this one since it's close to where he just moved. Awful service. Terrible. We took a seat in the dining room, nobody approached our table for over five minutes. The manager ran food to the table next to us, looked at us and walked away. We decided to go to the bar. Management decided to schedule one bartender while the U.S. was playing the World Cup. The bartender was doing her best to keep up, but she was  slammed. We got our drinks fairly quickly and then took 30 minutes to flag her down to order our food. 30 minutes later we got our food and it was cold. We alerted the bar tender, told her it wasn't her fault, and asked to speak to a manager.  The manager was a complete asshole and all but laughed in our faces. Encouraged us to write a bad yelp review. It was so disrespectful we were shocked. Corporate, please get this guy out of your restaurant.
