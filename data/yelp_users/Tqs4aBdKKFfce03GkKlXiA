Overall, the best Mexican food chain restaurant in The Valley.  As far as torta places go, I would rank it in the top 4.  Most likely at #3 right now, right behind Los Reyes de la Torta.  The 2 tortas I have tried so far (the Mexicana and the Cubana) have both tasted great, and the Cubana really was distinct from the other chain 'Beto places in that every meat could be tasted distinctly and not as some meat mash. However what truly sets tortas paquime apart is its aquas frescas and pan dulces.  Try the melon aqua.  It was almost reminicent of a creamsicle.  And the donas are drop dead.   Overall, the ambiance,  cleanliness and friendliness of the staff help push tortas paquime into the upper echelon of pheonix mexican places .

I'm sorry, the sickness I feel in my stomach is compelling me to post. And I never post ever. This place is objectively the worst Mexican takeout in the Gilbert-Chandler area. I'm sorry, but at least you know what your getting at Taco Bell and Del Taco. I got the Burrito Supremo (with very bad chicken and much for beans) and the Steak something. The steak was tasteless and luck warm. And a weird tinge of grey. Like it had been kept warm for a week in water grey. Don't go here.
