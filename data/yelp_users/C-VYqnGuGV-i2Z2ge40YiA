We go here once a week because we just can't get enough! The menu is extremely Japanese--so even the Italian dishes are going to seem a little off kilter. The food and drinks are both fantastic. I haven't tried an entree I haven't liked!  However, it is not a sushi restaurant, despite having a wide-variety on the menu. There's no open sushi bar, and the quality can be hit or miss on the rolls. I recommend going for the main entrees.

Fantastic little place! This restaurant is delicious and has a variety of different kinds of Vietnamese foods to try and some new twists on old favorites. I've been here twice now and had fantastic experiences both times.  Positives: -Fun "off the menu" items that changes with the season -Long menu with lots to choose from  -Tasty food and (non-alcoholic) drinks  -Good prices for a large portion.  Negatives: -Service isn't the best  Overall, great place! Definitely worth a try.

This is definitely one of my favorite sushi places! The rolls are good quality, and if you go during happy hour, pretty reasonably priced, too. However, they are not stellar, and you can definitely find better quality elsewhere.   Staring with the positives:  -Great happy hour and reverse happy hour specials. Their drinks are pretty good, and the Black Raspberry Lemon Drop is awesome.  -Unique sushi rolls with fun names. Don't expect traditional here--it's definitely Americanized with a college focus. -The atmosphere is wonderful, and the low lighting and interesting seating kind of makes it look like a club  The negatives: -Your server will be hit or miss. There's a couple there I really like, but there are many who can be neglectful.  -It can get pricey. I don't mind pricey sushi, but when they're non-traditional, I don't like paying too much. Going during happy hour really helps! -If you're waiting to be seated, they take you to a waiting area with water, menus, and appetizers. I just don't understand why they can't convert these into more seating space.  It's definitely a college hangout, and it's a great place to go for a few drinks and rolls if you're not too hungry, or heading out late. They're open until the wee hours of the morning! Also, a good tip is they have a pretty cool lunch program with punch card. Definitely check it out.  Overall, great place, and great atmosphere. They do have a lengthy process for checking IDs, but I'm indifferent since it's so close to ASU.

By far the best nail salon I've ever been to! I found them via Yelp last year, and I've been going ever since. The prices are on point, and the guys there are always willing to try new nail art and make accommodations. My nails are extremely professional looking, and I've never had problems with chipping or breaking.   Word of advice: Make an appointment! It's right next to ASU so they book quickly and there's only four guys there.

I was supposed to go to a different sports bar, but ended up here instead after some communication mishaps. I wasn't looking for anything too special, but this place was definitely lower than my expectations.   Upon entering, I was immediately turned-off by our waitress who was overly friendly, invasive, and needed her fingers to count if I was 21 or not. However, she was attentive, and came by several times to see how we were doing, which I appreciated. Sounds like some other Yelpers didn't get the same treatment!  The food was mediocre at best, but the prices are relatively low and they bring a ton of food so it's easy to split and save a little. The menu is long, but there's absolutely nothing interesting on it. No interesting twist on American favorites, no chef creations, nothing. Just the same standard food you can get at any American restaurant.   For an appetizer we split the supreme nachos with pulled pork and they were decent. Definitely better than I thought it would be, with a small kick. For my meal, I ordered the fish and chips, which was okay. The fish was a little too greasy, and it was wide, flat pieces, instead of the traditional thicker long slices. The crust was also strangely spicy, which I did not appreciate. The fries were mediocre--definitely had better.  The atmosphere was really nice, however. Large tables, lots of television sets, and they usually do raffles to win a sports jersey, which is cool if you're into that sort of thing.

Went here for the first time today and it was definitely a pleasant surprise! It's the traditional drive through car wash, but with a great twist. The employees are stationed at various points along the conveyer belt to hand wash windows, the body, and hand dry. They even do the tires by hand!  Definitely worth it and better than automatic car washes. It costs 8 dollars for the deluxe and with an ASU ID you get a dollar off.   Only negative is that the windows were a little streaky. Otherwise, great deal.

Great place! We had some old jewelry that we weren't wearing anymore and decided to get rid of it. Unfortunately, we were nervous about going a regular pawn shop. I had read some great reviews about this place on Yelp, and decided to check it out.  Positives: -In a great neighborhood -Friendly staff -They just write you a personal check there--no unnecessary forms.  Negatives: -I thought it was worth a little more, but I didn't mind and knew that was the nature of the industry.  Overall, definitely a good place to go.

This place is excellent! Every Saturday after Cherryblossom, we go to Snoh and have delicious milk tea or what they refer to as "snoh" which is basically the consistency of snow. Very light, and powdery.  Positives: -Fun atmosphere  -Great products--definitely try everything once  Negatives: -Little too expensive. You get a lot, but not a lot of snoh. -Staff is a little abrasive  Overall, I will definitely be back.

We live really close by and had been meaning to come for awhile. We finally had a chance to stop by and really enjoyed it! The atmosphere was very relaxing and the employees were very helpful and polite. For us, the setting means a lot and we were more than pleased with everything. Also, the prices were definitely reasonable--way more reasonable than anything by ASU.   Definitely shaping up to be a really nice place!
