Wine bar with a little attitude. Sit at the bar and meet the staff. You will be happy you did. Consistent kitchen and fun crowd.

Lots of potential. A good location and a comfortable patio. The bar has very limited seating so the patio is the place to mingle. On the positive side, the menu is original and edgy. There is an amazing variety on both the food and drink menus to choose from. Portion sizes are small (think 3 bites per taco) so be adventurous & try several things you wouldn't normally order.  Service is the weak link here. Believe what you see in all the reviews - the wait staff & kitchen aren't ready for customers yet. I was there on a Monday afternoon at 3pm. Plenty of open seating on the taceria side and plenty of staff. Everyone was friendly and made me feel welcome .....but too many mistakes to overlook. Knowledge of the menu needs to go beyond pronunciation. I look for the servers to have tasted the menu & be able to give helpful insight. Not happening yet. No offer for water, simple margarita took several reminders & still came out after my second taco order. The marg still came out before silverware & a napkin which I requested 3 times.  On a positive note, the staff brought me an extra taco & later an extra margarita - explaining that both were over-runs that would go to waste. I think they just felt bad for dropping a few balls. I will definitely be back but i am going to give them some time to work the issues out. In the mean time, Canteen off Mill Ave in Tempe is a good alternative for a taco & tequila fix with good people watching.

Just give it a try. Anything I say will not do it justice. A perfect special occasion go to. This place will be on top for a very long time.
