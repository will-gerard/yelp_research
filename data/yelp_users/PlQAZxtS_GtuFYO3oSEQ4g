While headed to work every morning I come in and order the day breaker, a salad for lunch from the grab and go, a coffee and refill my go green cup.. The girls are wonderful if I am not in a rush I will have my yummy egg whites there..   BEST OJ in town!!   I have been fighting a cold and been getting one every morning.. Grapefruit juice is also wonderful..   Try the havana with almond milk!   All the people here are great. Parking can get a little crazy.   They are opening up the jndigo too soon!

Hmm.. Don't know how they have the reviews they do..  Food was gross!   I got a gyro plain and simple... I assumed it would be awesome since its a greek place..  I don't eat the pita itself I eat the insides, there was a few pieces of gyro meat not big pieces with a ton of lettuce.. The sauce was really thick not impressed at all.  They get two stars cause the drive thru was fast.

When the owner send you a message saying he wants to make it better for you next time that is wonderful that he stays that connected with his customers. Service is huge and for that he is brought his last review back up!  Thank you for that!

The grind is a smaller venue compared to the surrounding area. Been to the grind 5 times or so.. The burgers are good but the wings oh boy the wings are better then LGO's all the way to hooters.. I was in heaven! I go back for those and sweet potato fries..   I have a favorite bartender and she do a wonderful job taking care of everything.

Today I just dropped in and wanted a gel manicure. While I was getting my manicure (Nicki) did a fantastic job she took her time asked if there was anything I would like to change was extremely friendly and did a great job!   Bonus: she gave me the most amazing hand and arm massage not a fast slap on lotion and go she spent a good 10 minutes on my massage (no up charge) and it was deep and spectacular!!  While I am sitting there it was so amazing I had to stay for a pedicure and it was just as fantastic!!

Thank you for being the best location for customer service..   I live on camelback road around 24th street which would mean that the Biltmore and Scottsdale fashion are closer to my house.. So why do I make my way to the extra drive to see this location?   Because this location is by the best in the valley of the sun (even better then Chandler) the service is fabulous! Not to much can we help you or you should get this and this.. But genuine wanting to assist you in finding what ever you could need for a work out.  There has been times when they don't have a size or color and they will call other locations or even log on and check the web to help you!   When you have. Issue with a item they always try to make it right.. Its work out clothes things happen but they do a great job at helping you.

Carmel's I love you!   The OJ is fresh and yummy!! The service is spectacular..  Atmosphere: adorable! It can get very crowded but boy oh boy is this place super cute!!  Outside sitting is cute.  The CHAI is fantastic..   Get the tartine., yes you'll have asparagus pee but it really a great treat.   They only have one bathroom..   HA wait till you see the awesome recyclable cups. Reminds me of kids cups.

Monday morning wake up to go get a cup of joe and enjoy the sunrise.. Swallowing is hard... Sick as a dog.. Think I can power through it!   Go to breakfast..  40 mins later.. cant take it..

The food is fantastic, the service its top notch and the atmosphere is wonderful..  I live on my own and luckily live very close to north.. I go there a lot! Most of the time alone and enjoy dinner, wine, & espresso @ the bar.. I know all the bartenders and they are wonderful we all laugh and enjoy the evenings..  All the regulars as myself all know each other and if its not a football game that night we will all move around and sit by one another and laugh and enjoy the great nights.   Enjoy the outside views at night the bar is open cause the great weather.   I cant think of one thing I don't like about this place. They give me this family feel when I come in.

Just do it get the membership!   I have been a member for two years and love this place..  I do get frustrated when they do specials cause they get extremely booked and I cant get all the special body rubbing, face picking, tanning and lots more.  Big Sarah (she isn't big she is just taller then little Sarah) well she can give you a deep energy massage! Heaven!  Little Sarah is good bug very soft no deep tissue there. The new guy was fantastic! He has been here a few months now he is fantastic for massages he gets in there very strong hands. Dominic is gone :(   Facials are... Fantastic you get special love when your waiting for masks and everything to soak up. The massage you and put this moisturizing things on your hands.  Spray tan wonderful! Wax great!

I found my home away from home! Not only is this studio magnificent. Everyone at HYU is there for questions never judging if you have a bad day just standing behind you telling you that you can do it! Being in today's world time is a valuable thing 60 minutes is great because it not as long as your average 90 minute bikram class but just as rewarding. Life is stressful and can have bumps along the way but this studio walks the walk and cares about everyone and reminding them with words of inspiration to just be kind and loving to everyone and dedicate the time in the studio to give back to yourself. Thank you so much HYU!

Come here with a open mind to try fun twists on food..   & make sure who you choose to come with will share food cause that is how you have a great experience of the menu.   Have had sweet potatoes was pureed with bacon froth. Total spin. That and the corn chowder are not on the menu cause all the changing.   The summer and winter squash was a very pleasant surprise! The new soup cant remember the name was wonderful and had a similar to a Mexican homemade delight!   The arugula salad was amazing! I love arugula when done right candied pecans, figs, chicken, light and not to creamy dressing cant wait to go back and get it soon..  The menu changes a lot and fast. Always something new and yummy!   By far a favorite. Deserts are unique AND adorable   Service great too.

Ortho-AZ.. I have been with Dr.  Martin for a year and a half now working on my right shoulder. He has operated on it twice and can say he is absolutely wonderful!    Dr. Martin = 5 stars  So you may ask why the 4 stars? My biggest issue is the the wait time.. Its a touch and go issue some times I get in and out really fast and other times it take a hour till I can even get in the back. (Try to get in as early as possible). One other issue I have is one of the front office staff was extremely rude a few times when I was asking a few question about apt and surgery times. She acted as if I was stupid and was bothering her. Try to always work with Ashley she is the best up there!  The x-ray tech was fantastic too. Always goes slow and watches out for your injured wing in my case..   Dr. Martin takes his time on you while you are there to answer Q's and assist you in anyway.   My surgery was scheduled for three hours but cause there had been more to work on he didn't just say oh guess that will have to wait he took the time and energy and kept working to total 7 hours. Really did a great job!

Been here a few times now and made it official one of my favorite places to eat..   Tonights dinner was great:  British Columbia Oysters Shrimp  Hush puppies  Big blue crab jar and butter (forgot the official name)    "Eggs and ham"  NY steak  Malbec and death in the afternoon for drinks...  There was two people for all of this food!   Crazy! But yummy!   Was my friends first time here so I felt the need to get a selection of different things but then share it all..   Been going here regularly there are some thing you just have to get and so we did.  All in all you cant go wrong with anything.

Best wine bar in Arizona!   What a GEM! They have fun games, fantastic music!  The owner doesn't have a staff he is a lawyer who didn't want to do that anymore and opened up a wine bar is dad work her and wife on occasion.   The wine selection is fantastic.. Cool fun beers also.. They don't have hard liquor but that isn't a problem they have a white wine similar to a vodka..   Cant wait to be back!   Amazing happy hours!

If it was possible to give negative stars I would!!   DO NOT GO HERE!!!!  I went to the hospital and found out I had the flu and bronchitis (obviously I didn't feel good) I got my prescriptions and went to CVS (been going to CVS for years) dropped them off and said I would wait and told them because I was contagious I didn't want to go inside and get other people sick and I would wait in the car, she informed me it would be 30 minutes, instead of going home I waited, 30 painful minutes go by and I pull up to pick it up she informed me it would be another 15 minutes okay, time goes by and then I pull back around sorry we just got the one medication in and will be longer.. It's been a hour! I was better off going home and having someone else pick it up.   They could have called and let me know it would be a hour, nothing not even an apology!   Don't go here!!
