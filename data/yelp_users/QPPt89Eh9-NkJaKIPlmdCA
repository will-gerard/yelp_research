Katie and all her staff are simply amazing! I came here years ago... Moved away and now I'm back and had to come to this nail shop! They're amazing with designs for your toes and gel manicures! I personally love to change it up often and I love knowing that they'll match my hands and toes perfectly! I also get waxed here as well!! If you're looking to get pampered, come here and you won't be disappointed!!

Mark was simply amazing from the start! I was referred to him by a good friend of mine as I needed help!! I have 2 chihuahuas and one loves to pee in our room!! (My female) well I just had a newborn on 8/30 and knew the carpets needed to be treated ASAP! So I called, he answered and we scheduled our appointment. He was punctual which I appreciate! He is very friendly and super quick and efficient!! He finished our 2 rooms and offered me and my father in law to see what he pulled from the room. I was shocked and disgusted but I'm happy he showed us! The rooms do not smell at all!! He uses all organics and no chemicals so it is safe for the whole family, yes even our newborn and our pets!! He even gave us some tips for after care once my baby is a bit older!! Overall I'm very satisfied with his service!! I'll be using him once a year as he recommended or we will pull the carpet!!   If you need the job done right... Call Mark! You will be satisfied!  Thank you Mark!!!

I've been in this salon a few times but today was my last! I take in my daughter who is 4 months old and usually everything is great! Today I was questioned if I bottle feed, I was told that I'm parenting all wrong because I cosleep, and I was even asked when I was going to return back to work? All in all I kept my cool, paid and will never return here again.

First time here... Lady who did my pedicure didn't know how to so a french pedi... So another lady finished my toes. Then I waited 30 minutes to get a fill!??? They aren't super busy but unorganized as they took a walk in before me? I guess this is what I get for trying a new place!! I would not recommend this nail salon!!! The only reason I came in here is because my salon is closed for the holiday and I couldn't wait until Friday to get this done... I paid for my pedicure and left. They told me they would give me a 20% discount on my fill when I come back? I won't be going back.

The reason I give them one star is because we use to love kneaders! This location is WAY to slow!! Plus they always mess up our order. They've lost a customer for sure. We will never go back. Waiting 30-40 minutes for a salad or sandwich is insane!!
