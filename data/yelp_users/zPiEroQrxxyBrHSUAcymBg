I never would have walked into the Herberger without my brother, the dancer. Since his joining of the resident modern dance company at the Herberger, I've seen him perform twice now at this theater.   I love that they have multiple theaters in one building. Because of this, the Herberger is always buzzing with people. There are people of all ages here, except for maybe the ushers. I'm not sure who's responsible for the lighting, and sound here, but I think they do a really tremendous job. I'm not at all the type who is into details, but I mentioned this to my brother, and he said he was also really impressed, even from stage.   I'd really like to find another excuse to see a show here, and it seems like they bring a great selection. The theater center is newly remodeled, and there's a cute little lounge upstairs called Bob's Spot. Also upstairs is a small art gallery. I've seen a few great sculptures of there, and even a Leslie Nielson plaque....random.   We usually find pretty decent street parking given that it is downtown. There are also surrounding parking garages nearby as well.

Friendly folks  My friend and I stopped into this place to get our last drink for the night before having a late night meal at Denny's across the street. The place was pretty much cleared out and it looked like they were about to close, but the bartender, Gary, was still very happy to serve us.   I didn't wander around the bar, but it looked like a pretty average dive bar. There were pool tables, and dart boards.   We had a nice chat with Gary, and met the fairly new owner as well. I wish I had more time to spend in here in order to get the full experience. There will be a next time, I hope!

My family has been buying and eating cakes from here for the past 20 years or so. We have always ordered the fruit chiffon cake that has remained consistently good for the past couple of decades.   My parents bought a cake for my college graduation and brought it down to Tucson for my sorority sisters and I. These girls are from all over California, where they've tasted great Asian desserts, and they all loved this cake.   You don't have to go anywhere else for candles either. They've got great customer service, and will offer some candles to you too. I have no idea how many calories I'm consuming when I eat the cake from here, but it feels so light, I'd like to think I'm being good.

After having moved back to Phoenix 2 months ago, I stumbled into this happy hour spot because I read somewhere that it has free wi-fi. Lucky for me, I think this may soon become my favorite happy hour place in Phoenix. The cellar was really intimate and cozy. I actually have no idea what the upstairs restaurant looks like. There was a confusing fireplace downstairs which is perplexing when you come in from the 100+ degree heat. It definitely made the ambiance more intimate and I don't even remember feeling the heat inside.  The menu was really awesome, and I had a lot of trouble deciding which happy hour appetizer to choose. I decided on two which ended up being more than too much food. The ceviche was all white fish, and sweeter than I typically like, but it was definitely fresh. The steak tartare was also very fresh. I only wish the bread was sliced a bit thinner. The beer selection was not too bad at all. They have Chimay on tap, and Hoeegarden in the bottle which is all I need. For the amount of food I ate, and the beers I drank, the price was really affordable as well.  I also really enjoyed the prompt, and friendly service. I will be visiting this place pretty often, and hopefully with one or two friends. The cellar is not really friendly for large groups.

My initial impression of the service here was: awwwkward... Then the server made me feel like that Pretty Woman chick on Rodeo Drive. When I asked for a drink menu, the reply was "oh, we don't do frozen drinks here." WHAT?! THIS ISN'T APPLEBEE'S?! No wonder there was valet out front! Hello, sir, I don't allow frozen drinks here either. I actually walked in knowing I'd be ordering the steak off the restaurant week menu, so I really wanted a glass of red, but I was completely turned off after that.  The pastries here oozed with butter which can be considered decadent, but I kind of thought it was a little disgusting, especially after time passes and those pastries get a little cooler than room temperature. I guess that's what I get for not eating them quick enough?   The vichysoisse was pretty good, and the steak was decent, but not memorable. I can't even remember if we got dessert, but I'll just say aside from the initial impression, the rest of the night just wasn't memorable.

Third time is definitely a charm.   First time: I had a gift certificate, tried the panini and an awesome selection of red wine I can't remember. After hearing so many great things about Postino, I was quite disappointed that night. My panini was just.   Yup. just.   Second time: I came here with a friend and it was his first time. Since it was our 3rd stop for happy hour that night, it was a bit hazy.   Third time: I decided to try this place again with my brother and my sorority sister who needed a ride to the airport. We did the bruschetta, and bottle of wine for $20, and it more than made up for my first experience here. The Grayson was such a good cabernet selection. My brother even bought another bottle to take home for our dad's birthday. It's also $9 off any bottle you buy to take home. We ordered our board of 4 bruschetta, and although they made a mistake on two, they made it up to us by bringing out the original two we ordered, so we tried 6 different bruschettas. They were all different, ranging from sweet to savory, but none of them were bad.   The service here is really awesome, and it's consistently good. I can't wait to come back to try the other bruschetta flavors!

Keep in mind - ***** - "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" - IN ARIZONA  Being that my Thai grandmother's blood runs through my veins, and it's all I had growing up at home, I'd like to say that I'm a pretty credible Thai food yelper.  For the past MANY years, this is the only Thai restaurant that my parents will dine in.   Their menu is pretty eclectic since they offer everything from stir-fried noodles, noodle soups, stir-fried meat/veggie dishes, and fried rice. I had the pad Thai the last time I went to pick up take-out about 3 weeks ago. It was WAY spicy, but I asked for it. Despite the streams of sweat that were rolling down my temples, the noodles were delicious! My other favorite dish here is the pad kee mao which translates into stir fried drunkard. This dish is best spicy as well. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and love authentic Thai food.

Charlie's + 3-4-1 Sundays = F-M-L Mondays  In my entire life, this is the only place I've been to that entertains the idea of a 3-4-1 special. Is that even legal under Arizona laws? No wonder there are so many cabs that pull in and out of this place. You could definitely drink comfortably for a great price knowing you're only a step away from a taxi.   I also enjoy the drag show they have after the special... at whatever time I usually start putting down my drinks. If my blurry memory serves me right, the deal ends at 7, so the show might start around 8. The people here are pretty friendly, except for the one who stole my 3 day old Jimmy Choo sunglasses. I probably wouldn't have lost them if I was allowed to bring in my purse, though. Thanks Charlie's!    There is also always a volleyball game going on outside in their sand court if you're the sporty type.   I've also been here on a Saturday night, but I think that's typically when men are on the prowl, so I didn't really sense a casual, patio-drinking type of atmosphere. I'll stick with the bane of my F-M-L Mondays.

Although some of you may have the idea that I was born with the ability to use chopsticks, I'd like to announce that I am pretty sure I wouldn't know how to use them at all if it wasn't for Da Vang.   Being westsider-riders, my family and I have been eating at this restaurant for as long as I can remember. My mom's old hair salon was only a mile away, so we often stopped by in the morning for banh mi or spring rolls take-out. If you're not familiar with banh mi, make sure you try to catch one of the episodes of No Reservations when Bourdain goes to Vietnam. A bite of the banh mi (sandwich) is like having a flavor explosion in my mouth. Sometimes I'm not a fan of the lightly pickled cucumber, but the jalapeno slices always gives me a nice jolt of spiciness, and the flavors of the meat are awesome! You can always ask them to remove any of those items from the sandwich.  The pho here is always good, and my brother and I also love the bun bo hue, which comes with vermicelli noodles and a dang good, spicy broth. The meats they toss in here aren't typically what you'd find on mom's dinner table, so make sure you read the menu and are cool with those.   The reviews regarding the decor are definitely accurate. Had I not been growing up on the stuff made here, I would probably think again about going back. They have actually even remodeled, and expanded it since I was a child! If you're that concerned about it, I suggest ordering take-out. I've never gotten sick from the food here, so I assume the kitchen is clean!   Another great plus is that the food is very affordable. I had dinner here on Sunday, and the total for two people in food comas was $11.25.

Bad, bad, bad....  I think I may have arrived during a bad weekend because I received the worst guest service at any hotel I have ever stayed.   The guest service agents were not friendly nor welcoming. Although the staff was helpful, I sometimes felt like I was disrupting them. It didn't seem like a very busy weekend at the hotel, but it felt like 2 of the 3 who helped me that weekend were in terrible moods.   I ended up having to transfer rooms before I spent a night in their bed, and although getting a new room was pretty smooth, the result of it was a pain. In the process of moving, I did not completely transfer all of my belongings into the new room. I remembered the next morning, and was able to obtain my makeup bag by asking the front desk for help. It wasn't until I was doing the 3 hour drive back home on a Sunday afternoon that I realized I had also forgotten 2 dresses in my room. I immediately called the hotel, and was told that I would be transferred to Housekeeping/Lost & Found because the housekeepers were still in the building. I left a message for the lady to call me back regarding the dresses, but never heard back. I understand it is my fault that I forgot the dresses; however, I wonder if it is a Hilton policy to only return what was claimed, and not everything that was left behind?  Also, every morning, I woke up to loud banging, talking and shouting. I have stayed near the laundry rooms in other hotels before, but this was bad. It sounded like they were under some sort of construction/remodeling. I did speak to the manager regarding the noise, and he said I wasn't even near the housekeeping room. He was also able to get my dresses for me and offered to have them shipped to me.   The price, management, free wi-fi and parking were definitely plusses, but for what I went through at this place, I won't  be returning. I'm glad others have been able to have a great stay though!

This place used to be my favorite sushi place when I first started going about 9 years ago. As the years go by, the quality, freshness, and taste of the food has failed to please. I used to recommend this place to friends and visitors, but now I can't even get myself to go in there for a meal.

I wish i could live here forever!  The service here from the spa to the bar is exceptional. We really enjoyed our stay, and the views from every corner of the resort were the beautiful. Day or night, the colors of our setting really stood out. At night, the pool lit up pink, purple, and blue. Jade bar, of course, had green decor. This is also a great place to check-out the sunset which Arizona is known for.   We didn't get the chance to take advantage of it, but I loved that they provided bath salts. We stayed in a mountain casita, and the room was very open and inviting. There was even a window that opens from the bathroom, over the bathtub that looks into the sleep area.

Major Disappointment!   Second-rate customer service began right at arrival while we were checking-in. We waited patiently to be helped, and when we were finally able to check-in, we were faced with an unfriendly welcome. Our condescending guest service agent rudely interrupted other agents and guests while she was still assisting us.   On our way to the room, we noticed the white exterior walls badly needed a new paint job. Not only was the exterior an atrocity, but the inside of the room had tears in the wall paper, and unfinished/missing trimmings on the wall. The size of the room and bathroom was decent considering the large balcony over-looking the Scottsdale Mall/garden. The bed; however, was impressively comfortable. If you're looking for a loud pool party, this is the place to be all weekend. Good luck getting in though, the line is outrageous!   The only saving graces I found in this place was the Skybar, and Red Room. We wandered in for a drink at the Red Room on Saturday night and were thoroughly impressed by the acoustic cover band playing that night. On Sunday night, the Skybar transformed itself into a french themed night titled Pere Lachaise. The DJs were two of the best I've heard in a long time mashing up 90's to current hip-hop, classic 80's, and some house. Since I can still visit these two bars without checking-in, I will remember to keep it that way for the next time I need to stay in Old Town Scottsdale.

I've been to this establishment about 3 times in about the same amount of years, and boy is it GHETTO. I ordered a Ketel and soda the last time I was there and I'm pretty sure it was just rubbing alcohol with soda water. A couple of the girls I was with came back with some free shots, and they also tasted like disgustingness. I ended up spitting mine out and throwing it away. It was seriously the worst shot I had ever taken, hands down. It didn't even taste like liquor, more like some sort of cleaner.   I give props to those solo dancers who are giving it all they've got on the dance floor. They're so brave. I feel like some of them are related to those awful American Idol singers who are tone deaf. They don't realize they're bad, and they are just embarrassing themselves and getting in others' ways. At least it's never packed, so it gives them plenty of room to do ninja-looking kicks and arm fans. There are also go-go dancers here, but they weren't too entertaining with the exception of one...out of the 4 or 5 who were there. She'll probably be going somewhere else soon.  I always tell myself I won't return, but I've had to take it back a couple of times now. Maybe it'll be your lucky day if you ever show up, and we can spit our drinks out together!

My family and I come here once every few months. It's pretty difficult to find a restaurant my parents like, and they actually ask my brother and I if we want to go there for dinner.   Being former chefs, my parents like to cook the meat at the table. We have always gotten great-tasting, fresh meat everytime we come here. We typically order a plate of shrimp, and a plate of pork. We also start with a large plate of fresh sashimi too.   The service is pretty good, but we did have an issue with the manager one time. My brother left behind a memory card for his camera on the table in the restaurant. When we went back in to ask for it, he said he hadn't seen it - with a smirk on his face.  We still continue to eat here because there aren't too many choices around our house for good Korean food.

My checking account is grateful for Binkley's location, but my taste buds are not.  I ate here for one of my best friend's 25th birthday, and we consumed nearly 30 courses. I would highly recommend ordering the tasting menu, primarily because the bonus courses blew the main courses out of the water. Although smaller, the bonus courses packed  punches in terms of flavor, and creativity. Binkley's sure knows how to tease your palette with the surprise courses.   Here are some highlights of the night: White truffled deviled quail egg Bite of sloppy Joe Pommes with dip Mangalitsa pork Charcuterie Plate with perfect foie gras, and egg yolk mousse.   I won't spoil the rest for you, but I would say everyone has to go here once. Thanks to Francisco Salter, we had an amazing experience!

Why is it so grainy?   Are cookies that are mostly organic supposed to feel grainy? After skimming through the other reviews on here, maybe I just went on an off-day. It was Halloween 2009 when I stopped in with a friend for a couple of cookies, and decided to take home a dozen other cookies, and another dozen cupcakes. I guess I should've tasted them before I decided to drop $40 on 2 dozen treats.   The service was nice, but it felt a little awkward. There wasn't a huge selection of cupcakes/cookies, so I told them I just wanted to do 3 types of each to make it 2 dozens for my boxes. I was with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, so while we were in conversation, the counter-servers interrupted us a few times to ask which cookies/cupcakes I wanted.   I thought the taste of the cookies and cupcakes was pretty good, but I just didn't understand the texture of the cookies. The cupcakes here were actually "cup"cakes. I didn't like the little cups they cooked the treats in. They made it difficult to pry open the dessert to eat. I would have much rather prefer paper liners. I had so many, and was able to eat them through the week for breakfast, but I probably won't return.

I feel like a dork for reviewing a Subway. I hate chain restaurants, and I hate fast food, so why am I doing this??   I feel like a super star whenever I walk into this store. It's always "HI, welcome to Subway!" The young men who work here always use "ma'am, " and "sir" which I think is so old school, but they really are always so respectful. I've started to keep my stunna shades on in the store since I get the rock star treatment anyway.

I ate here with my family and friends for my birthday dinner, and we all had a pretty decent experience. Although it was summertime in Arizona, their outside patio did not feel hot or warm at all. It was surprisingly comfortable. The steak I tried was impressively delicious, and everyone else said their food was really good. Myself, and another friend ordered the whitefish which was seasoned with way too much salt. I wish I had ordered the steak.   I really love the atmosphere of this place, and can't wait to try out their happy hour.

Different...  I stayed here for the night of my birthday celebration a year ago, and I thought the place wasn't too bad.   The pretty good-sized rooms had wooden floor laminates that I wasn't used to in a hotel. it worked out for us since we brought a puppy! I thought the room and decor was very clean and it made me feel very comfortable.   If you're looking for a pool; however, this is not the place to stay. The deck could fit about 4 people to lay out comfortably in their loungers. And the size of the pool was awful. I could barely bathe the puppy in it, and he was a 3 pound pomeranian at the time.   My experience at the bar was wonderful. I was roaming the place by myself until my guest arrived, and the bartender was really sweet. The weird thing about it though is that the "business center" (two desktops) was set against the wall about 20 feet away from the bar, and another 10 feet away from lounging sofas. After leaving the bar, the bartender had a drink sent up to my roommate for my birthday drink. That's great guest service!   I've stayed at 4 other hotels (Hilton Garden Inn, W, Hyatt Summerfield, and Hyatt Place) in the area since and this one is by far my favorite in terms of service and cleanliness.

I love forgetting about and visiting Jade Bar every chance I get! It's truly an unforgettable place, but I feel like it's such a special place, it should stay in my back pocket until I have a special reason to visit. This time, they were actually under construction and we were able to see the great mountain views from a new window. I also love how I couldn't t tell they were under construction until I asked why Jade Bar was moved. I'm really looking forward to seeing the expanded space once it's completed!   There was live music on Saturday night and the drinks were as wonderful as I remembered them to be. I would go so far as to say their drinks are the best in the valley. The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars was due to the Lobster Pork Dumplings. The appetizer came out surprisingly fast, so that was a positive; however, the kitchen left much of the flavor on the plate to the sauce instead of combining them into the meats in the pockets of dough. I also had a couple of chewy pieces of lobster as well, and that's definitely not what I expect when paying $15 for 4 dumplings.   As always, the service was exceptional, and I can't wait to see the expansion.

Amazing customer service and sushi. Mediocre robata items.   I had the best birthday dinner here about 3 weeks ago. The couple who brought me here had been here 2 other times, so I knew I was in for a treat. We sat at the sushi/robata bar, and since the menu was just so vast, we decided to do the omakase and let our chef bring out what he thought we would like. We told him we wanted to do mostly sushi.   The amount of food we got was INSANE. I had never eaten so much in my entire life. The quality of their fish was outstanding. I was really impressed. Here's just a list of the things that we were served: butterfish tataki with white asparagus, beef tataki with a chili ponzu sauce, fried tofu with avocado and wasabi mayo, burnt tomato salad, fried oysters with ponzu and shisho, 2 large toro tuna rolls, 2 kinds of Spanish mackarel sashimi, tuna sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, sea bream sashimi, butternut squash tempura, yuzo marinated black cod, grilled wild Madagascan tiger praws, grilled pork belly, cold soba noodles in broth with quail egg and green onions, baby pork ribs with sweet corn in butter and soy, and grilled Shishito peppers with ponzu and bonito flakes.  Are you still reading this?!? We were so incredibly full, and they said they had some lamb cutlets for us too. Unfortunately, we had to turn them down and ask for dessert.   Side note: The manager, William, knew we were there to celebrate my birthday, and he actually gave us a traditional shot of japanese sake. The drink was dry, and really smooth and was served in a tall shot glass placed inside a wooden box. It is customary to pour the sake so it overflows into the box for prosperity. When done sipping on the shot, you pour the remaining sake from the box into the glass and finish it.   Back to the incredible dessert. We waited a good amount of time for our dessert and we were wondering why since they typically offer a sorbet. When they finally brought the dessert out, we were all amazed. Not only we were served ALL the flavors of sorbet, but also an assortment of fresh fruit. Here's another list: mangosteen, cherries, strawberries, kiwi, green tea custard w/banana foam, peanut butter sorbet, and yuzu sorbet. My hands down favorite was the yuzu sorbet.   Overall, this place offers the best customer service, and they have a great selction of fresh fish. The items that were grilled were inconsistent. Sometimes it was overflavored, and other times the food was bland. I can't wait to go back here and just eat some sashimi.  I would also highly recommend the blood orange margarita and honeycomb shochu!

Not a place for food.   I am very particular about my sushi, so I was pretty skeptical about trying out the sushi here. The options for sashimi weren't too tempting, so I thought I'd be brave and try out a roll since there were so many of them. A lot of them sounded pretty creative too.   I decided on the mori soba for half of my meal, and also ordered a AAA Box Sushi Roll. The mori soba was actually the perfect thing to get for a warm summer night. The soba noodles were perfectly cooked and the nori, ginger, and scallions that accompanied the tsuyu were plenty. The AAA box sushi, on the other hand, was the greatest disappointment of the night. It is called AAA because it includes layers of Avocado, Asparagus, Albacore, and of course, rice and nori. First of all, it took forever for this roll to come out. Everyone in the party had finished eating by the time this roll arrived. The server said that it takes a long time to make this roll, but there is the possibility that he may have forgotten to order it. The albacore and asparagus were barely noticeable. All you can taste was the rice, avocado, nori, and the sweet sauce they smothered the roll in.   This place definitely has a good atmosphere if you're just looking for a place to hang out and have some drinks. The customer service was a bit slow, but the server bought our birthday girl her drink, so that was cool.

Small, dirty rooms...   I stayed here the Sunday night of All-Star weekend and was pretty excited considering the location and possible celebrity-spotting.   When I walked into the hotel room, I was a bit shocked at the layout and size of the room. The bed was smack-dabbed in the middle of the room and the bathroom was basically out in the open, just a few feet away from the bed.   While I was getting ready in the narrow and tiny restroom, I realized it looked like there were tiny splatters of blood on the wall over the toilet. SO GROSS! We just left it at that since it wasn't like we were going to touch it or anything.   After lounging on the bed and looking things over in the room, it looked like it had been a while since they had rented out that room. Everything was pretty dusty, and it looked like someone had burnt parts of the wooden bed frame.   We ventured to the pool that night for the All-Star after party and it was truly beautiful. The lighting was great, and the stage was set up at the far end of the pool. There was also plenty of seating around the deck to enjoy your drink and watch the show. The prices of the drinks on the deck were a bit inconsistent depending on where you got your drink, but after I left my tab somewhere, I ended up paying less than $100 for about 7 or 8 drinks.   After filling all this information out on their online survey, the price of the room was refunded back to the credit card, so that definitely shows they are willing to accomodate and offer great guest service. I would recommend staying here if you get a good deal and are really comfortable staying in close quarters with someone.

This place is so sexy.  I actually spent my most recent birthday celebration here with some great friends because the days of parading around half-naked in nightclubs are a tad behind me now.   They have an amazing drink menu here. The Moscow Mule comes in an adorable copper cup that makes you want to commit a small crime. I would also definitely recommend the St. Germain. It's a sweet martini, but one of the best I've ever had. This place also makes me want to buy a meat slicer and a slab of prosciutto for my own home.    Hanny's is definitely one of Phoenix's finest gems. It has a great deal of personality. Drinks, food, and tunes are always fantastic. See you there!

Worst "Japanese" food experience I've ever had in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!  I've always wanted to try this place out since I've been to nearby establishments (AZ 88, Pepin's, Mondrian). It looks really trendy from the inside and out. The banner outside looks like they offer a promising happy hour as well.  When we walked in, we received great service from the hosts. The restaurant was fairly empty since we were there for dinner on the 4th of July. When they showed us to our table, I had to wash my hands, and by the time I came back to the table, there was already a small glass of ice water waiting for me.   I really wanted to try their sashimi despite their high prices, but when I asked the server if they had a smaller sashimi plate to have as an appetizer, her response was to look ovey my shoulder at the menu, and say "uhhhhh....." I was with someone who didn't eat sashimi, so the big sashimi plate would be too large for me. It would have been nice if 1) she knew what was offered in the restaurant and 2) she could have offered a suggestion.   We decided to order edamame, the potato spicy tuna roll, and an avocado roll to start. Edamame and avocado rolls are ubiquitous to most sushi places, so I am going to skip the review on those items. We were both really excited for the spicy tuna roll because it sounded really creative and different. Presentation was awesome but it did not help offset the taste of the roll. I was so disappointed when I tried a piece of the roll. The sweet chili sauce they drizzled over the roll was definitely sweet chili sauce straight out of a bottle. For example, (http://www.mondofood.com/images/Thai%20Sweet%20Chili%20Sauce.JPG). I know this because I used to work at a restaurant that used to send the stuff out with their spring rolls. They seriously pulled sauce right out of the bottle!? In my opinion, the only bottled sauce any sushi restaurant should use is Sriracha.   I was starting to get nervous for our entrees. I ordered the baked Chilean sea bass, and my friend got the flash grilled Chinese chicken salad. Again, the presentation of both items was beautiful and showed creativity, and again, the taste of the items was beyond bad. I ended up sending my food back, and was so disappointed that I couldn't order anything else. I believe there were two sauces on my plate. One I believe was a lemongrass soy and that was okay, but there was something that tasted and looked like an aioli. It actually tasted like spoiled ranch. My friend was also unimpressed by his salad, but continued to eat it anyway - bad idea - we had to stop halfway home for him to run into a restroom.   The waitress took my meal off the tab, and we were pretty impressed by the customer service. The taste and quality of the food, however, were so bad that I will not be able to return to this place.

Oh my Posh!  The service here was really great, so that's always a good start. I enjoyed our food although both of our seafood dishes were slightly overcooked, and my fish was overseasoned. The sweetbreads and kangaroo were both very well cooked and flavored. The presentation was clean.   I'd say the name is a little bit misleading as it's not really "improvisiational." To me, improv is just executing without prior thought. Based on what we ate, and what we observed being delivered to other guests, you can tell they had set dishes.   I really enjoyed my dessert which was a piped pistachio cheesecake with puff pastry.   I'd probably go back again for Restaurant Week since it's cheaper, but not sure if I'd go any other time.  It was real, it was fun, but it wasn't real fun.

Is it worth it?? I'll let you decide.  I probably had the best pedicure ever at this salon on Saturday. When I read the reviews for this place, I knew I had to go. I was sold when I heard something about wi-fi. I actually wasn't able to get online, but I was enjoying my pedicure so much, I probably wouldn't have been able to get any work done anyway.   It is true that the massage was pretty amazing. On top of that, my nail technician had really amazing attention to detail. The place is also really clean. They scrub their tubs immediately following the pedicure which is very settling.   The things holding me back from giving it a full 5 stars are the fact that I wasn't able to get online, and the price. After tipping my nail tech, I paid almost $40 for a french pedicure. Although I really had a great experience here, I won't be able to come here as often due to the price.

One * for location. Another * for the calamari taste, but not a really decent portion.  The seats hurt my ass. The drinks aren't that delicious. The food is too fusion, and it's not a very good fusion. The first time I ate here, a friend of mine and I stopped by before I dropped her off at the airport. She ended up spending  majority of her plane ride back home sitting in the bathroom.

I think this Mexican restaurant/sports bar is a great concept, but boy was this a big miss.   When I walked in, I noticed there was a private party in the immediate bar/room to the right of the entrance. If I remember accurately, there were about 3 TVs at the bar in there. The crowd here is a little bit older, but everyone looked like they were there to have a great time - MILFs, DILFs, and cougars included.   I went up to the host stand where I waited for almost 5 minutes. Many servers walked by, but no one bothered to help, or tell me someone was on their way to seat me. Once I did sit down, I waited for about 15 minutes for my friend without being greeted by a server. Once she arrived, we waited another 20 minutes before my friend went to grab a waitress. The waitress apologized and told us she didn't realize she had our table as well. I've worked in a few restaurants through college - long enough to know that things sometimes get mixed up, but when you have a table waiting without food our drinks for 30+ minutes, you should probably go ask them if they need any help!   The food isn't worth talking about, so I won't.

Hillside definitely hits the Spot!   There aren't too many great options for breakfast/lunch near my office at South Mountain, so I was thrilled to find that I really enjoy this place. I've gotten sandwiches to-go every time I've been here. I wish I've had the opportunity to sit down and eat here. Hillside is pretty sparse in terms of decor, but the restaurant has a very clean feel, and I love the open kitchen. There's always whole rotisserie chicken spinning over their grill. I've also seen whole tomatoes on the grill which gives the place a nice inviting smell throughout the restaurant.   They offer counter-service, and everyone who's ever helped me has been friendly. I've been offered coffee while I wait as well. My favorite sandwich is "el gallo" torta. In between the soft bread is avocado, chorizo mixed into the scrambled egg, tomato, and a bit of mayo. It is seriously what gets me out of bed some mornings. I also love that they use local ingredients and partner with local vendors. Their menu is also reasonably priced.   If it wasn't for the long drive back home, I'd like to give this happy hour a shot. They've got a pretty interesting wine selection I'd like to try, but I'm not sure how well that would go with my breakfast sandwich, or boss.

Art, Film, Beer, & Wine.   This is a great place to catch up with old friends, or to bring a date. It's pretty casual, but has enough personality to hold its own. I like to order a beverage while I make my way around the venue to check out the art pieces. This place is even better if they have a DJ spinning that night. The music is just as diverse as the movies they show here. I saw a crazy weird vampire movie that I ended up walking out of, but it was a fun experience, nevertheless. The selection of beers and wines is also really great, and appropriately priced.   I'd like to check out the comedy nights here, but I'm not sure if I'll get the opportunity any time soon. Maybe next time!

I really like this concept for a quick breakfast/brunch spot, but the execution wasn't too delicious. If you know me well enough, you'll know my first thought when we walked in was "is there booze???" The answer is yes. I recall seeing your typical breakfast bevies such as mimosas, bellinis, bloody mary's, etc.  So you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food.   I thought the location was great, and the Sunday brunch crowd was nice. I'm not sure what it will be like when the students come back, but I don't think I would be back to find out.

A tad bit disappointing...   My newest pet peeve is waiting for a table when I have reservations. A recent occurrence happened this weekend when I showed up five minutes early for my 830pm reservations and was finally seated at a table at 850pm. The accommodating hostess did present us with two glasses of rose, but when we sat down, we realized we weren't that special because everyone else around us were also served complimentary rose...   The meal was off to a decent start with the lamb riblettes and paprika cured pork belly. The glaze on the riblettes was slightly sweeter than my palette likes, but the flavor on the lamb was really wonderful. I was surprisingly pleased with the pork belly. I have gotten to the point where I swore off pork belly for so long because no one knew how to 'wow' with it. A fatty piece of pork can do well on its own, but I like to think the kitchen tried, and the staff here did an awesome job. I had also never had sarga turo, and really enjoyed it with the pork belly and golden beets. We were again slightly disappointed when a new couple sat next to us and was advised of a drink and entree special for the night that our server neglected to tell us.  The most disappointing part of the meal was the main course. We both ordered fish for our main since we had red meat for our appetizers. The yellowtail looked very dry as it was sat on the table, and its texture was the same. The chilled tuna was slightly better, but unimpressive.  My date later pointed out that the yellowtail served to our neighboring table was both cooked and plated much better.   I feel like this place has a lot of potential, but definitely has more room for improvement. I may give it another go, but I'd have to be convinced it can be done better next time.
