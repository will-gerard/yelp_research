Absolute lowest prices. We didn't feel "sold to." Helpful staff. We were in and out quick.

Beware! I was robbed at this place (now a Jackson's Car Wash.) Items were taken out of my car. I usually don't leave anything in my car, but I was on foot back to work and the items weren't valuable to anyone but me, so I did not think they would be taken. Their corporate level district manager said that he knew the employees well and that they wouldn't have taken anything. Things were taken and whomever did it still works there. Find another pace to wash your car/change your oil.

It is a shame that such a beautiful and usually very quiet apartment complex is ruined by the people who manage it. I lived there for over two years. Any time we had to go to the office for any reason, whether it was to pick up a package or renew a lease, something would go terribly wrong. The entire staff was different every 6 months and no one ever worked there long enough to become competent at their job. "Managers" were always rude, unhelpful, and gone after a very short time. The worst part was that when I moved out, I was denied a request to be present for the final walk through inspection. I was later billed to replace the carpet. They claimed it couldn't be cleaned and had to be replaced at my expense. I requested to see photos taken and in viewing them was absolutely stunned that they were bold enough to claim that the carpet couldn't be cleaned. Do not rent here unless you want to be continually frustrated and taken advantage of when you end your stay with them.
