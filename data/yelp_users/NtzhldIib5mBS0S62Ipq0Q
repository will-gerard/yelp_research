I attended a wedding in May, 2014, that a DJ named Gregory hosted. He was rude, unprofessional and ill-prepared.  His equipment was not working properly but surprisingly he didn't have any back up to complete his job.  He even ended the reception early without consulting the family.  I wouldn't hire this DJ if he was the last one available. Hopefully he won't ruin anyone else's special day.

I have been a loyal customer of Scruff's for several years but I will be finding another place to purchase my pet supplies from now on. Scruff's used to be a great and friendly place to come and chat with the employees, support local business and gain some knowledge about food or pet care. Now, for whatever reason (management change?), the energy has changed to the point of feeling stalked by the employees, specifically by Nicole. I even witnessed her, basically, pushing another employee out of the way to complete my sale. I don't know the other employee's name. I had not seen her there before but she has shoulder length blonde hair. Are you REALLY making sales commission based in a pet food store???? I'm truly disappointed and I hope they can find their way back. In the meantime, I'll take my business elsewhere.

Jamie has been doing my nails for awhile now and I am always happy with them. I can't wait until she starts doing facials!

Having attended several of the shows that are performed by students of this studio, I decided that because, THESE ARE MY PEOPLE, I needed to take some of Miss Lucy's classes. I signed up for a weekend intensive with two amazing performers, Paco Fish and Lily Von Schtupp, and learned more about performing (and not just burlesque) in four classes than I learned in a semester of acting class. I plan on taking more classes as my time allows. It is WELL worth the 45 min drive from Goodyear!  Thank you for the inspiration!

I have been taking burlesque classes for a few months now and I can't tell you how much of a difference it has made in my self esteem and confidence! I LOVE STUDIO VAVAVOOM!
