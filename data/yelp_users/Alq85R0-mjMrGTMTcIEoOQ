We had lunch at Capital Grille on Camelback, Phoenix. It was not very busy, but we were taken to the table immediately & the waiter approached us right away. I ordered the Grapefruit soda, & my companion ordered a Lemonade. Turned out the Grapefruit Soda was very bland, & almost tasteless; however the Lemonade is really good. I changed it to the lemonade. I ordered the Seared Salmon salad. My friend ordered the ribeye sandwich. Both were very good. Mine was very tasty!!!!

The best happy hour menu & happy hour drinks. The coconut lemon sour tastes great & the crispy green beans are to die for. Very reasonably priced happy hour food menu ! The spare ribs are very good too. Highly recommended!!!

Love this restaurant. It never disappoints. Service always good & food delish! I ordered a salmon ceasar salad ($18). Lettuce tastes very fresh & a generous portion of salmon. I also ordered a side Brussels sprouts with almond. Very very good. I will recommend every one of my friends to dine here.

Sunday breakfast at the Overeasy. They have a new decor, which looks clean & uncluttered. Much better than before. However, the food is a little downhill. I ordered the eggs with sirloin steak. Perhaps I did not read the menu in details; I thought I was getting a piece of sirloin steak with 3 eggs. In reality, it's diced sirloin steak. It's over cooked, chewy & tasteless. It's not good value for your money ($11). Won't go back there anytime soon !!

This is my 2nd time. The first time was lunch..it was very so so. This time I was thinking I will give it another try. I did the dinner buffet. It was ok for the price; but somehow all seafood & meat don't taste very fresh. I did like the stir fried green beans & the rice noodles. Actually most of the veggie is good, fresh & tasty. Other than that, not so much. I wish they would charge more so that they can give us more quality stuff. Won't go back there anytime soon !!

I have eaten at the Henry before. I love their decor, spacious with comfortable table seating. The service is always outstanding at the Henry. However the menu is a little bit limited. I noticed the menu hasn't changed much since the last time I ate there. I ordered the guacamole with chips ($10) as an appetizer. My main lunch was the club sandwich ($13); plus an order of side salad ($5). My friend ordered the scallops. She told me it's very good. My Club sandwich was ok; good portion. The turkey was just turkey ham. I expected it to be real roast turkey (as in Breakfast Club). The side salad was disappointing, just a few leaves next to the sandwich on the same plate. The guacamole was really small portion with a few chips on a narrow dish. All in all, I am not much impressed with the food or the menu. I was hoping for a better selection of food. With these prices, you will get a better quality & quantity somewhere else (I.e. The capital grille).
