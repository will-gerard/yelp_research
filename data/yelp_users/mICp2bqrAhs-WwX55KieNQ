Have a great time dancing to the 80's music on Thursday nights.  Great crowd, friendly.  Oh and good food too.  Awesome!

Love the ReUnion Thursdays.  It's the best 80's music in the Phoenix Area.  It's great to dance and watch movies on the big screen from back in the day.  Reasonable drink prices and really good food.  I highly approve and I'm glad it's every Thursday too.

I was really disappointed.  We were in on a Tuesday night.  Service was friendly but very SLOW.  They "forgot" lots of things.  We received our side item when we were almost finished with our entree.  Food was OK but WAY OVERPRICED for quality of the meal.  I won't likely go again.

Really great!  Cortland arrived on time and was really professional and curtious.  Asked details about what the issues were and then talked about the services.  Put on booties to come into my home so not to get the floor dirty.  I used a Yelp coupon.  Could be more pleased.  I would use this service again.
