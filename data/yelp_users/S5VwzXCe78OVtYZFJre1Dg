Best pizza in North Scottsdale, hand down.   The sauce is what makes these pies delicious, never had anything like it before. The cheese and thin crust add to the flavor, makes it very easy to dip the pieces into a plate of olive oil.   I've always picked up the food, never have experienced the dinning room atmosphere, but if your in the neighbor hood, I would try it out. Don't waste another dollar on the big pizza chains, Spinato's is well worth the extra money.    When friends come  into town, here is my to-do list:  1. Introduce Spinato's into their life. 2. Everything else.   Maybe I just like pizza too much...

Since I work right down the road from Luke's, I tend to see it a lot when I am roaming around looking for something good to eat for lunch. I have to say up front, I've never had a classic "Chicago" style dog, but I figured I would go in and see whats good. This was about a year ago, and since my first visit, I have been back multiple times.   The service is what you would expect for a lunch time crowd. It can get busy, but the staff seems to manage it well. Of the menu, I have tried their chicken fingers, Italian sausages, hamburgers (cooked to order, so you have to wait a little bit) and their Italian beef sandwiches.  All of these items were good.... but nothing compares to the Double Dog, and heres why: They make it exactly how I want it, plain with two slices of provolone cheese melted on top. Amazing! You get fries and a beverage along with it, all for about $8.00. Not to say this is healthy at all, but come on, what Chicago style dish is? The Double Dog keeps me coming back.   An Al's Beef is just down the road, but in my experience, Luke's is a better bang for the buck. I also really like that staff is very friendly and likes to strike up conversation.   Again, I am no expert when it comes to Chicago beef or whatever...but If your in the area, and want a great meal for a decent price, Luke's gives you just that. No bells and whistles, just good food and a good lunch crowd with sports on to keep you company. I have yet to go in there and have a bad dish, or a bad experience.

Love this place. After visiting Greece and searching for something to replicate how the Greek make gyros... I must say, this place does a great job.   The staff is very friendly...I'm going to guess and say family owned. Plenty of Franks Red hot to go around, never knew how good a gyro was until I sprinkled some Franks on it.   At first, I thought the price was a little high, but then, after I had finished my meal, I couldn't have been happier. Well worth the $7.00. The best part of the meal was the amount of taziki sauce was just perfect! This restaurant has become a staple in my local lunch spots, especially when I want to sit outside and enjoy a peaceful lunch on a busy day.  A must try if you love gyros.

Buyer Beware!!  What an awful experience at Airpark Dodge in Scottsdale.  I purchased a Jeep Wrangler about a year ago from Airpark and also purchased the MPP "wrap" insurance plan. The staff at Airpark made me feel great and said I was now "part of the family." The wrap insurance? "A great deal. I'll cover pretty much everything!"   Everything was great... until after my most recent oil change. I started noticing the check engine light kept coming on sporadically. Now, I'm not a mechanic, far from it. So I take my Jeep into Airpark for a diagnosis. It's my daily driver, I don't do any heavy off-roading, and I'm thinking it has to be something "wear and tear" related.   Nope! I get a call and the rep tells me its "rodent damage." Rodent damage??? Not only that, but they aren't going to file a claim with the MPP insurance because "they know it won't be covered." So I call the MPP insurance and they say they won't cover it unless a claim is filed. Interesting... I'm now battling my dealership and the insurance company to file a claim so I'm not $400 out of pocket. I take my Jeep from the dealership ($130 out of pocket for them to tell me they aren't going to fix anything) and go home, defeated.   I call a friend over who works on engines and we pop the hood to look at what Airpark is telling me is "rodent damage." We find that one of the cords to the camshaft sensor has been cut. Not bitten off, or scratched off by some little rodent, but cut, like with scissors. So we solder it back together and the OBD meter now says the problem has been fixed.    Like my title says, BUYER BEWARE. Not only do I feel like Airpark cannot be trusted, I was told that the MPP insurance I was sold "isn't any good. I should've bought insurance somewhere else." This was told to me by their service rep. What a great feeling!!!!!   You always hear about mechanics doing dishonest things, but you never think it's going to happen to you. Check and mate. It happens. Oh, and when I left the dealership with my Jeep, I was told I would get a call to see if there were other options for me. That call never came. So much for being "part of the family."
