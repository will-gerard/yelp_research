5 years ago I went to some other pre-school. after i dropped my daughter off at the start of the second day I got in my car and I cried in the parking lot. I went back in and got my daughter and kept her home w/ me untill we found the right place. Primrose was that place and has been for the last 5 years and 3 kids.  All of them went through the Primrose school from pre-k to kindergartten.  there are less expensive schools to put your kids in but the care at Primrose Fltchr Hghts is unsurpassed. The ownership, staff , and curriculum is top notch. I hear people say that they don't want anyone else bringing up their kids but, quite honestly, even if either my wife or I was home full time, we wouldn't be as creative and do as much as Primrose has done with our girls. They stimulate them intellectually, creatively and socially.  We will be done this May with Primrose and we will genuinely Miss Heather & Greg Legeeza who passionately care about the product and service they provide their families. I could write alot more about the staff, field trips and open door policy but - you get the point.  In any business or industry service makes the difference and for that; I give Primrose 10  on a scale of 0-10  ( To date They are the 1st and only review to gain that rating on Yelp from me).

I have been to jojo's many times and it is my choice for great pizza on the northwest side.   The pizza is fresh and consistently good. Reminds me of my pizzeria that I owned back in NJ.  I have had the salads, chicken parm, eggplant parm and it's all good. The food comes out quick considering they are usually busy and the staff is knowledgable and attentive. Even though I pass two other pizza places on my way to JOJO's ....it's worth it. I give JOJO"s    8 pizza dough's outta 10 .....

I strongly recommend Hacker accounting for all your personal and business accounting needs. They are service oriented and always are responsive to my questions. Frankly I don't know how they keep up with all the laws and changes every year. They are family owned and operated and as a business owner having a great accountant can save or sink your business. Saving me time, money, and stress counts for a lot in business. Cathy and Chris have always done a great job and I wouldn't go anywhere else.

My wife and I bought two pair of glasses at the optical Gallery and I stopped in to get my lenses replaced as per a warranty that I bought when I originally purchased them. My glasses were $400 so I figured another $80 for the warranty was a good investment to protect them. Well after 10 months they were scratched from cleaning etc. so I brought them in. They sent them out for a week or two and they came back perfect. I bought the 2 year warranty so after another 10 months I had more scratches. then one day my glasses fell out of my bag onto the pavement in a parking lot and i had a big scratch on one lens. When I brought them in the manager (Jen) said well, they might not honor this because the scratch was too big. She then proceeded to tell me that the warranty only covers 'Normal' wear and tear. I was confused. I considered what had happened normal wear. Then I asked for a copy of the warranty I bought so I could read it and understand. Jen  told me that they don't have one. So I asked for the companies' website I was sure they would have it posted there, the manager said there was no website. That sounded a little hoaky so, I asked for their phone number and I would just call. she said they don't talk to consumers. Ok, well now I don't know whether to laugh or get annoyed because the warranty seems random and ambiguous.  Then I asked if I didn't have the big scratch would they have replaced the lenses because of the little scratches. She said yes. Now I'm just frustrated. well then it doesn't matter that it had a big scratch because they would replace the lenses anyway, right? C'mon, I wasn't trying to get over on them I just wanted what i paid for and what was fair. Understand these were expensive frames and progressive lenses. They didn't get run over by a car or get dropped off a building. I dropped them. I asked that manager if she could understand my frustration. the manager said she would ask the insurance company to make an exception. I Thanked her. She called me the next day and let me know they would repair them as per the warranty. I was relieved and I said Thank you. A week or so later I got the call that the glasses were ready. Great I was set to pick them up and I was going to bring something to say thank you the next day but, my wife stopped by instead. Well the owner personally gave her my glasses and told her that he appreciates 'her' business (she just spent another $400 on a second pair for herself) but, I was not welcome back in the store because I 'Terrorized' the staff (I only spoke to Jen the manager) and I cost them money because 'They' had to pay to have my glasses repaired. So all tolled we have spent over $1,000 in the last two years and I cost them too much money. So I get it. I'm High maintenance and you take zero responsibility for your customer's experience. Thank you Optical Gallery for fixing my glasses and honoring the warranty. I appreciate that. we will not be back. You are now free to be right.

I like cabin coffee. Its a nice hidden place where I can go and have a quiet cup of coffee and talk with a friend. It's not a hang out for HS kids. It has a nice Cabin feel to it and the staff is friendly. Oh, PS the drinks are tasty and interesting. the Coffee is always good. I drink it black so if it's been sitting there past it's peak, it's easy to tell but, I have never had that experience there. It's just a nice relaxing place to read the paper, catch up on email or chat w/ friends. I have not had any food there but they look very tempting.  I give Cabin Coffee an 8 out of 10.

I love North. I loved it even more when it was on the west side of Phx. We went there for anniversary's, birthdays, New Year's Eve and anytime anyone comes in from the east coast we go there.  The food is consistently cooked perfectly. The fresh fish is excellent and never overcooked. The Osso-Bucco is awesome and never dissapoints. the restaurant has a new york feel to it and very comfortable. Staff is always professional and knowledgeable. It's compettitlvely priced but we've gone back there more than any other restaurant in the last 5 years in Phoenix.

the fish is always fresh, the beef short ribs are always tender and love the seasonal veggies.... It can get a little loud on the weekends but it's always a great experience. The staff is knowledgable and friendly. and Their bread is so good. For a corp Fox rest. concept, North is the best !

I love Dillion's. I go there once a week at least.  My kids love the Mac n Cheese... really is the best around.  The bbq is awesome and always fresh, the smoked salmon is killer the salads are great and the staff is very friendly and knowledgable. Fresh Cole Slaw here, no bucket slaw. Everything is Fresh. Alex is the best waitress. She always gets the food right and is a pleasure to have her take care of me. You can find "cheaper" but you won't find fresher and better tasting food in a very nice casual atmosphere.  I have also been to the Lk pleasant rest. and on T-Bird but the Glendale location is my fav. !    I give Dillion's of Arrowhead 9 slabs of baby back ribs out of 10.

Smoked salmon sandwich at Dillion's is killer...  Dillon's features 3 home made bbq sauces.... but the 'Sweet Heat' is my favorite !

This was one of those restaurants that you knew was bound to fail in 18 mos. great location but completely over priced.  their signature cheese steak sandwich was 'steakums' minced to nothing w/ some pieces of onion and a couple of green pepper pieces throughout.  All this for $8  I brought my daughter there and her chicken fingers and drink and my sandwich and drink and fries was over $20....    not in this town ... there are just too many other options where you get a better value for your buck .  Just keepin ' it real.

I took my BMW to Lake Pleasant Collision Center because someone referred them to me. I got into a fender bender but of course I wanted it done right. I have to say that Lake Pleasant Collision Center exceeded my expectations. They kept their word, and dealt with my insurance company 100% on my behalf. The car looked great  and they even fixed a couple of extra things at no additional charge. It's just nice to not feel like you're getting 'nickel-dimed' when gettting your car repaired. Very professional, honest and trustworthy. I would not hesitate going back. Thank you Aly for keeping me updated every step of the way. It's no 'accident' that you have so many postive reviews.   Thank You

I went To Big Eye Sushi because my friend had a coupon from restaurant.com.  we sat at the sushi bar and there was only one other table in the place. I ordered my usual,  Yellow tail, mackerel, and salmon roe.   The mackerel was grey and tasted like tuna fish out of the can, like it was cooked. I told the chef behind the counter and he told me it was cured. I was like;  Are you Serious? we had the calamari appetizer and it was like rubber bands. not fresh.  I'm not a fan of Big eye sushi and wouldn't return. And by the looks of the sparce cuts of fish in the fridge in front of us and the few patrons that came in I don't think they will be there long. Sushi is a tough business in Phx for obvious reasons and food cost is enormous.  I give this place 2 sushi knives out of 5.  We had a $50 coupon had two big beers each and two sake's and tried about 7 dishes. The total after coupon was $130.      There are just too many better value and better quality sushi places to go back to one that is marginal.   Service was ok ... nothing notable.

I went to Ninfa's a few weeks ago with two other couples. The staff was fun and friendly and our waitress was great. The Margaritas were very tasty. Not too strong and they won't give you heart burn w/ cheap sour mix.  The food was very good. It's compettitively priced but overall a nice experience.

I went to this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It's new and clean and of course it's got 'firemen' parafanalia all over. The staff was friendly and attentive. It had some interesting combinations and my food came out pretty quick. I enjoyed it and 1/2 a sandwich was just right for me. It was pretty much the same price as JerseyMike's but with more creative menu choices.  Let's just say this;  "It ain't Vita Mia's on Harrison Avenue in Garfield"..... but you're not going to get better on the westside.  I give the Firehouse subs  a good solid 7 out of 10  Pepperoncini's.

We stopped in to Sushi Catcher because a friend told us it was good. It's small but clean and inviting. We were greeted by 'Sue' who is the owner along with 'KC' the Sushi Chef.  We let Sue know it was our first time visiting. We heard good things and wanted to see for ourselves. I'm a big fan of Sushi and my wife loves the specialty rolls. We had a very nice time and the environment was friendly. The food was great. I especially enjoyed my yellowtail sushi. I've seen this before this little place has been open for six months and is guaranteed that in another 6mos.- 12 mos. it's going to be hard to walk in and sit down.  They feature fresh wasabi (just ask for some) and Sue even gave us a little bottle of Cold sake' to go...  Can't wait to go back and see our new friends...

I used Type 4 you Graphics to help me with a special project for a 20th wedding anniversary present. We found an obscure picture from our wedding that was taken by a guest  but it was a beautiful picture of our friends. With one exception there were two old ladie's white heads in the way. Michele did an outstanding job of removing the obstructions to reveal a georgeous portrait of our dear friends. She then was able to enlarge it so we could have it put onto canvas and framed. The look on our friends faces was priceless when they saw it and the tears flowed. Thank you so much for creating such a wonderful memory Michele that we will cherish forever. I recommend using Michele for any of your personal or commercial needs. She is prompt and very reasonable.
