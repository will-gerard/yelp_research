Horrible customer service! If I could give this establishment a -5 I would, I had a free regular sub coupon, with no expiration date and they would not honor it. In fact they would rather throw the sub away than honor the coupon. Horrible customer service.

Probably the best brisket in the world, the ribs, the corn bread, sausages .... service was exceptional. The owner personal came out and thanked us for our partridge.
