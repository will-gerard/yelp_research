I rarely go out for breakfast.  But, when I do, I go to Crackers.

It's closed now.   Los Favoritos took it's place.  A significant improvement.

This is one of my favorite spots in all of Phoenix. But, I have a BIG problem.  The "Andy's Favorite TLT" sandwich is so damn good, I can't get to trying more things on the menu.   Great food, great atmosphere.  Best in class!

My wife and have been to pretty much every Indian Restaurant in Phoenix.  We go almost every week.  Since we went here, we have NEVER went anywhere else (except when traveling).    The food here is fantastic.  The staff has always been great.  But the food, oh the food.  Did I say it was fantastic?   My personal favorite is the Baigan Bharta.  My wife's is the Paneer Tika Masala.  But, all is great!

i was a bit nervous to my first visit. We were the only people in the restaurant.  Usually that is a very very bad sign.  However, the food was FANTASTIC.  I had the Jerk Tofu, which came with Beans & Rice, a cabbage concoction, and fried Plantains.  Everything was great!  I am not sure why the place was empty during lunch time, but I will definitely be going back!!!

Love this place.  I go once a week. It is the best of the "fast" Mexican food restaurants.  You will never go to X-bertos again. And to comment on the other reviewer, I have been here well over 20 times.  Never once had cold beans.
