I've eaten here several times and quite frankly I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews. Tonight was definitely not their night. It took forever to get service and once our food came out I knew it would be cold. I just told the kids, they are having a bad night lets go.  Bathrooms are a mess.  Service was terrible and slow.  This place needs some serious help. It's a direct reflection of the management or lack there of.  The stereo was way too loud for a family type atmosphere.

I had a friend take me there for lunch today. This is the way it should be when you go to a small restaurant. Very personable owner. I'm not a big Italian food eater but this food was delicious.  Relax and enjoy. No seriously enjoy because the owner makes you want to just enjoy your meal and experience.  Other restaurants should go here to learn how to run a family restaurant

So Disappointed in these guys. We used to eat here all the time but for the last 2 years the service is HORRIBLE. We went there recently for my daughters birthday because she loves to get up and dance with the rest of the staff. We told them this and they never got around to it.  Now it was a Monday so they only had 2 servers working there.  My other daughter didn't get her food until everyone was done eating.  The food is OK but this is supposed to be a fun place to go to.  I blame the management because they clearly aren't doing any training and they aren't backing it up with any kind of reenforcement or weekly meetings.  We may go back once a year to see if they go any better because it used to be a good fun place to get a burger. USED TO We shall see

I go here quite a bit and I don't think I've ever been disappointed. Good Service, not perfect but they will try and make up for it if they screw up. I love the subs. I take the kids there every now and again and have them split a sub since they don't eat that much so I get a real good value and a great meal.  I love their theme and what they stand for.  I also like it when you walk in and they yell WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE

Food's always pretty good here. Service is always pretty good here. Prices are very reasonable. I like taking the family out here for a decent Mexican meal.

I like this little family owned restaurant. The subs are good and the service is very good.  They aren't fast but everything is fresh and delicious.  The best thing is the delivery. We work about 1 1/2 miles away so I like to get everyone lunch at the showroom, especially on a Saturday.  They have a good easy to read menu that makes it easy to place my order online.   The first Tuesday of every month kids eat free. So it's pretty cheap to take my kids there.

The food was good. The service was pretty good.  It's not a sit down get served restaurant like you might expect. You go up to the counter, place your order and they bring it to your table. You get your own drinks and chips. This isn't a criticism just letting you know.  It was a little more expensive then I thought but that may just be because what we ordered.  The Best part was there was this young girl working there who started to sing with my daughter. It was quite entertaining. There was an older lady there as well who was very friendly.  It seem to me there's a lot of good people working there so I'm routing for them to succeed and you should give them a shot.

This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant. They use an orange citrus flavor on many things which is delicious. I love their chips and salsa.  The location is fantastic but they do get busy so expect a wait during busy hours.  I usually get the Carne Asada Quesidila

I went here once with a friend just to try them out. OH MY GOD! They served a sirachi sauce with my Onion Rings. I used it on my hamburger and now I'm addicted. I've been there 4 more times since within a month.  Service is a little slow so you need a little more time for lunch but the food taste fantastic.  I hear there beer is really good too. I don't really drink so I don't know.  They custom make their sauces and ketchup.

I hate to spend a lot of money on ice cream. Especially when I know I can buy a 1/2 gallon for the same price. But I was out n about with my daughter and we went to Petersen's for an Ice Cream. My 3 favorite flavors are Chocolate Chip Mint, Chocolate Chip Mint and Chocolate Chip Mint, so guess what I ordered.  Oh My God that was delicious. Not sure how or why but it was soooo good.  The hot fudge didn't hurt either. They probably deserve 5 stars it was just a little expensive but that's ok.
