Nice local hang out... Being here for only 6-9 months while we build a Cheesecake Factory we love to find a local spot... This one fits the bill of these two Phoenix transplants.. this dive bar has food to make this personal chef happy... Try the shrimp cocktail.. and a French Dip that makes Phil happy.. also try the chicken tenders.. homemade chips..

Born and raised in VT I am partial to all food made in VT...I make huge efforts to get it here in AZ...When I saw the VT Sanwich Co here in AZ!!!! and went in and inquired about of course you use Cabot VT cheese I was beyond heart broken to be told NO...and the reasoning was beyond what I could hear...has a connection...is this is that...I did not want to hear any of it...so for a place I was so ...at first....over joyed to find...I am so saddened it is not like home ....:( and I am also sad to say I will not be trying the food even if it did smell wonderful ....it just is not truly VT without Cabot VT cheese....

I found this place by "yelping" after reading reviews I made an appointment with the owner Michelle... she has been very patience with my need to have natural looking nails but using a product to keep them strong ... we started with gel...seeing I am a personal chef and wash my hands a TON that was just not going to work.. Michelle has found a way to use acrylic so it thin to look like gel and the polish that is one coat so I have natural looking but strong nails.. prefect for me! That and she is quite fun to chat with... bonus... Now only if she was in the Biltmore / Arcadia part  of town life would be a dream... having said that ... she is a worth the drive... :-)

You have a special of "fish and chips" and NO Malt Vinegar... What??? However the homemade chips are very good.. service is a bit lacks..  overall good dive bar but needs a good cook!!! And a staff that knows what malt vinegar is???
