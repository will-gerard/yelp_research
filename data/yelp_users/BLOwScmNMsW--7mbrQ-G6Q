This place rocks. I love my NY style pizza and these guys get it done right over here. There's a reason why this place has outlasted all the other shops that were once on this corner and it's because of good pizza and prices. They also have a good lunch special so check them out sometime.

I'm gonna keep this short and simple, you'll find good food here. This is my favorite Mexican restaurant around. The chips and salsa here are great and I've always had good service. I will be back for sure for my tacos and margarita.

This is one of my favorite spot to grab some clothes for the gym or work. I like the sales they have and it's usually pretty quiet so shopping is a breeze. Sometimes you can find good deals on the kitchen appliances as well, like the blenders for my protein shakes. The only thing I don't like about kohl's is getting hassled for a credit card every time I go here.

Bagels are average at best, very stingy here. No ketchup packets anywhere just one nasty bottle that everyone has to touch. The worst part about it is the people working here seem to have the biggest attitude, won't be going back here. Dude who runs the register needs to find a different job that doesn't involve ANY customer interaction.

This is a great place to get a protein packed chicken sandwich fast. The people that work here are friendly and the drive thru moves pretty fast. I only wish they were open on Sundays for my afternoon workout post meal. Other than that I like this place and that says a lot coming from me. Only downside is that it does get pricey but you get what you pay for and it's better than McDonalds (Which I never eat)!!!

This paper is so bad I can't even explain. Now that they are charging to read online I can't wait until they go out of business. Why pay for this garbage when you can read news from other valley sites for free. If I was gonna pay for news it sure wouldn't be this junk, it would be NY times etc.

This place is good if you need something fast. I like to order off amazon but I come here to scope out something I might want. I like to shop the video games and workout video section. My biggest gripe is that they try to hustle you for some garbage warranties and protection plans. That's why I order online and will continue to do so.

Good stuff here, I can get a protein packed lunch at a good price. Also enjoy getting to pick my salsas out and trying new ones. The workers here were really nice and looks like they had a decent lunch crowd which is good to see. I will be back.

Good foods here! Lots of healthy and organically which are perfect for my diet. I have to eat healthy to stay in shape and sprouts makes it very easy to keep conditioned. The cashiers here are usually friendly and if you go late at night the store is pretty quiet and you can shop without hassle. Lots of ready to eat foods as well so you can grab a meal pretty quick. Always clean in here too and that's a big plus for me.

This is a good gym for anyone looking for a good workout. Their cardio here consists mainly of treadmill's but still has elliptical's and step machines. The weight area might not have as many machines as LA does but they are good quality and tons of dumbbells and benches. They have a juice bar area, and a women's area which is good for the ladies. Price is right here, sometimes the locker areas aren't the cleanest but what can you expect it's a gym. Secure your stuff good though I have seen broken glass in the parking lot and police patrols so stay alert and don't leave nothing for crooks to steal. By the way the weights here are great and the place is nice and cool with lots of fans and the air blowing cold.

Do not go here! Place is way overcrowded, bathrooms were nasty. Tons of break ins in the parking lot. This place has outgrown it's size. Also if you cancel they will try to send you to collections. Again I can only stress, DO NOT GO HERE!!!

Good service and nice people working here. Place is super clean as well which is a biggie to me. Prices are fair when you add in shipping costs to buy online supplements.

This is a great place to relax and have some good BBQ food. The servers here are very friendly and do a good job. They give you big glasses for your drinks so you don't have to worry about refills that much. The food is good portion sized and they give you tasty biscuits. One of my favorite places to go after a good lift.

This place is great! I really liked the bread they give you here. Pasta here is fresh and not fake tasting like some other well known Italian places. Good run restaurant with an attentive staff. I rarely cheat on my strict diet but if I do I make sure to have some pasta from here.

This is a good restaurant that I try to go to often. This place has some good healthy foods which are perfect for my diet after my workouts. I also like the prices here, since I eat a lot of food from working out all the time I need to be able to buy a lot and my dollar goes pretty far here. Some favorites of mine are the chicken philly and gyro. Give this place a try if you haven't yet.

Came in here before and wasn't greeted by anyone. Felt like a morgue. I've been to the native in Tempe and enjoyed it, this one not so much. After no hostess or server came around for a few minutes we ended up walking out the door. Oh well guess I'll stick to the Tempe location.

This place is great, went for the first time this past week and had a good time. The staff was very friendly and our guide did a good job explaining everything to us and showing us the ropes, I believe his name was Nathaniel. The environment was was clean and lively with tons of climbers having a good time. Can't wait to go back for some more climbing.

I really like this place, it's got a good crowd and atmosphere. It's a good spot to go with a group of people to hang out during happy hour. Tons and tons of beers which is good but I gotta keep my strict diet in line so I won't drink too much. Service can be mediocre though sometimes so be sure to not be in a hurry when you come here.

This is one of my favorite local eats and I love the all you can eat pasta when they have that promotion. I try not to eat too many breadsticks because they really fill me up. The salad is always tasty too. Service here has always been really good and I plan on coming back.

Not a fan of this place. The front desk staff is usually pretty nice but that's about it. They charge a lot for nothing. They also try to nickel and dime by making you pay for some of the classes. The free weights here are cheap and don't have the rubber coating to keep them from making loud ding noises when I'm lifting heavy. In addition there's not enough good equipment in the workout area to keep my workouts fresh. The treadmills shake when I'm running fast and are always breaking. There's not enough parking either and the spots are narrow and crammed, which means you're likely to get dinged and dented. Can't wait til my contract is up so I can go back to a real Gym!

This place is hit or miss for sure, not a big fan though. I like to get my dance on and this place isn't that great for it. Drinks are the same as everywhere else but good luck getting one.

This place has some good food and is a nice place to hang with friends after a good workout. I usually get a burger here and they come out pretty good. They have a bunch of beers on tap and the interior of the place is set up nicely. Live music some nights and a game room with darts and pool tables as well. The patio outside is great if you're a smoker (not me though). Prices are average to higher but at least it's going towards a real restaurant and not a chain.

Prepare for the ultimate hustle if you come to this wash. The prices here are insane. They will try to sell you on any additional services that you don't need and make you seem like a fool if you say no. I don't like dealing with that kind of service and I'm sure my fellow yelpers don't either. Save your money and use the car washes at the gas stations and do the interior yourself. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the cashiers inside are friendly and I can get myself an iced tea from the dunkin donuts in here.

Good bagels here for sure. Protein packed sandwiches make for a good meal between my workouts. Good prices as well. I haven't tried the pizza here yet but I will be back to see how it is.

This is the best starbucks I've been to, and trust me I have been to a few. The drive thru here gets pretty busy so you gotta hope that you get lucky and catch it when its quiet. The workers here have always been friendly and they crank the orders out pretty fast. I like to get my breakfast sandwhich and a drink in the mornings. I wish this place was 24 hours so I could come by after my late night workouts.

This is the best place to grab a sandwich after a tough workout. This place is fast too so you don't have to wait around like you would at a subway. Much better quality ingredients too. Try the Vito and the Beach club. I've never had any complaints about the workers and they always seemed friendly to me and greet me on my way in and out. I will be back for more subs.

Love the fact that I can go to einsteins in surprise now. I used to go to the other bagel shop but got tired of dealing with the grump at the register. This place is brand new and has a drive up which is neat. Lots of different things on the menu to enjoy and most are pretty good. I don't do the lunch items though so I can't comment on those.

I really like this place. They have a wide variety of food here and the staff has always been friendly. Prices are very good, I'm not sure how some people spend so much they must be ordering special drinks or something. Anyways Good food and specials here. I like to get the omelette but everything I've seen looks pretty good, especially those cinnamon rolls sitting in front of you at the counter. I like how you order at the counter, saves time and money. I'm glad they moved in here after baja fresh bit the dust. I also like to eat on the patio but it is getting a little too hot out now.
