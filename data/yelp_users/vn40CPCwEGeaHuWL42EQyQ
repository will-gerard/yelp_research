I've never dealt with such unprofessionalism. Not only did employees point and laugh at me to the customers as I walked up to the building, I was denied service on an account that I am an authorized user on. I also had to prove I was over 18. As a heavily tattooed person with an engagement ring on my finger, it's very obvious that I am over the age of 18. It's extremely disappointing because I usually have average to phenomenal service at this location. I think it's time that Verizon upgraded their customer service

The younger blonde at the receptions desk is awful. She is the rudest, most miserable person I have ever encountered in my entire life. Not only did we catch her in a lie, she also made the process very difficult and kept changing what we wanted even though we booked our appointment ahead of time without making any changes of our own. While we were trying to enjoy ourselves, she kept rolling her eyes and pacing around the salon in anger. Every other employee was amazing, we are all satisfied with the outcome. However the receptionist should get a new job if she hates hers that much. The stars are just for everyone else.

Here I am sitting inside Cheba Hut, irritated enough to right a negative review about one of my favorite places. Today I ordered the sticky icky (Cheba's rendition of a pb&j). Not only did it take longer than my boyfriends pizza sandwich, it was on the wrong bread, barely any jelly, and the peanut butter was extremely watery. As a frequent customer, who normally receives a top notch sandwich, I'm pretty pissed. I didn't spend $5 on a pb&j to get the wrong bread and a watered down sandwich. Needless to say, I will come back (I love this place) I just hope the employees will be a little more aware of the orders they receive

The owner, Dorian, got in touch with me an apologized for the subpar experience. He also told me to come back in and get a sandwich on the house. If that's not great customer service, I don't know what is. I tried their new sandwich (I forgot the name; it was an asian fusion with pulled pork and jalepenos) and it was S U P E R L A T I V E! The service was awesome too. Happy Abbey indeed.

Fantastic service and food! Hands down the raddest Denny's I have ever been to! The restaurant was clean, the food looked and tastes fantastic, and our server Don was super personable! We will definitely be making this our hang out spot! A++

Excellent coffee and food! A great place to hang out with friends or by yourself. Very intimate with a Spanish twist

I have never experienced better customer service than I have at Clean Freak. I pulled up right as they were closing because my dog had just puked in my car. Not only did they keep the car wash open, one employee in particular went out of his was to help me. Eliah gave me a care kit to pick up all of the vomit and helped me with the car wash. And for a $3 car wash it was pretty damn great! I will definitely be coming back to this location for all of my car washes

The worst Chipolte ever!  I would give negative stars if I could. I walked in to three girls trying to close the store (keep in mind it's only 9:10 at this time, they still have 50 minutes for customers to come in). I was completely ignored, even after making eye contact with all three employees. I had to wait for the manager to come out in order to be helped. The girl who made my burrito did a terrible job. It's a burrito, not rocket science. Not only did she skimp me on my ingredients, she broke the burrito while trying to roll it. Even after breaking the burrito, she continued to wrap it in the foil. How am I supposed to eat a broken burrito? She then proceeded to ask me, with an attitude of course, if I would like to wrap it again. I am just dumbfounded by the disrespect from the employees.

Tonight I went into this location with my father and we are absolutely appalled. As frequent customers, we were under the impression that we would walk in and get the exceptional service we usually do; this was not the case. Not only were we ignored by the two ill-tempered, eye rolling employees, we walked into a filthy unattended lobby. After repeating our order multiple times to the absent-minded cashier, she still managed to enter it incorrectly. Once our pizza was in the process of being made, my father had to stop the other employee to verify his order. After multiple scoffs and dirty looks, my father had to pay a separate time to fix their mistake. Instead of apologizing for the miscommunication, the cashier rolled her eyes once more and walked off annoyed. Now that our CORRECT pizza was finally being made, I noticed that the employee in charge of creating these "masterpieces" didn't change her gloves she used for condensing Cambros full of raw meats. Violating a direct Food Safety and Environmental Services law especially in front of customers is not only repulsive, but a rational reason for me, a former manager in the food industry, not to return.

I've driven past this place a few times and finally decided to stop in. The food was fantastic and the service was even greater! I can't believe that I've been missing out on this hole in the wall. You MUST try the crab puffs, i am already craving them! This place has become my new favorite spot

Stopped in for a quick dinner with my boyfriend and the service was PHENOMENAL! Our food came out quickly, except for our fried pickles. However our waitress was very apologetic and even gave us a coupon for a free meal since they took not even five minutes longer than the rest of our food. The staff at this location is beyond friendly! We will definitely be coming back
