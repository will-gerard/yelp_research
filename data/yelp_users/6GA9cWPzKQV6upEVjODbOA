Alan at Framin' Works does excellent work!  I don't get things framed very often, but a friend gave me a limited edition photograph recently, and I did not want to take it to a chain shop.    The Yelpers that led me to Framin' Works are absolutely right, Alan is a pro and helped me find exactly the right materials and presentation format for my unusual photo.  I'm very picky about mats and sizing, but Framin' Works has the latest in technology - Alan set up my materials and we checked out different proportions right there on the computer screen.  It was great to know how my art would look before it was finalized, that gave me peace of mind knowing that it would be perfect when I picked it up, which it was!   As Arnold says, "I'll be back".

So Ms. GoGettr's car was stuck between a Ryder truck and an unscheduled Palo Verde limb in the road... Taking the lesser of two evils, I ran over the tree branch.  Scrapes everywhere all along the side of my poor car!  Lindstrom gave me a good deal on full buff/wax to get it out, and had me sparkly and shiny again in about an hour.  They took great care of my car and I recommend them if you're ever in need of an Oh Nuts scrape fix.  Thanks guys.

I've been searching a long time for a shop that I trusted enough to work on my vintage Porsche.  From our first meeting I knew Don understood exactly what I wanted done.  Based on the swanky rides coming through his shop, my car was small potatoes, but Don treats every customer like gold.    So, I had several original speakers rebuilt, and an iPod adapter put in, and my system sounds fantastic now!  I am so pleased.  If you're considering stereo work - go to Soundwerks on Scottsdale, they really care about you being a happy client!

So, my primary car is parked outside, and since I have to get it washed every time it even sprinkles, I'm a cheap carwash regular.   I've been to many of the $5 carwashes, and Snappy on 48th St and Broadway is The Best Cheapo Carwash.  Here's why -   They always have a clean, picked up, facility.  I never get the ew yuck I don't want to touch the buy wash kiosk factor.  For those that have problems with the machine, there's usually someone there to help get them through the (very easy) touchscreens.  The attendants are great at pre-spraying my car and putting on some de-bugger before it goes into the wash tunnel.  There are SO many facilities that don't do this!  And it makes a big difference in the results.  In the tunnel, the spray things that get your wheel wells and tires are turned on, even for the cheapy $5 wash.  Other joints often turn those off for the cheap wash, which bugs the heck out of me.    Vaccums are always working, and there is a $1 mat clean if you need it.  Lots of bays to vaccum your own car, it's easy to get one that is shaded right for whatever time of day you are there.  Little things like, they plant flowers at the entrance to the wash!  Who does that?  It's cool, though.  So, there you have it, a great place for a quick wash.

Still dig the Snappy car wash - not quite as on the ball as they used to be though - no more flowers, and the full service wash guys are often over-booked.  It's nice that they have the option of full service, but check to see if they are busy before paying for it up front, you may end up waiting quite some time to get your car back!

Great vibe and location for we S. Phx folk, but ye gods, beware ordering a "house Cabernet" during Happy Hour - $12 a GLASS!  For happy hour house wine?  Are you kidding?    The hhr food is a great deal, we'll be ordering beer next time.. phew.    Caveat emptor.  Bring a high limit credit card.

AZ weed guard has an agreed upon price for my HOA-gave it a try and so far so good! The weeds are dead and now the yard (xeriscape and rocks) just needs to be cleaned up - too bad the dead weeds are not cleaning themselves up the little buggers.  Have to go with four stars instead of five because of a delay in scheduling (about a week and a half) -because our neighborhood is so far away, they have to schedule homes in groups that need to be done in our area of town.  This is totally understandable from a business perspective but it did put us pretty close to the wire with weed violation notices that we had been getting.  All in all a solid business-I would recommend them to fellow homeowners.

Dropped in on Christmas Eve Day - I got there at 9am and they really do have their act together for the holiday rush.  Three people at the counter, two helping in the lobby, stacks and stacks of pies waiting for happy homes.    I was glad to get exactly what I wanted (no, I didn't think ahead enough to pre-order...) - can't wait to try the AZ Orange pie and various savory pies (today's special was Green Chile Beef, yum!).  I have to give Piefection five stars for what I expect will be a killer pie and terrific service on a holiday!

So I was lucky enough to be wandering around Mill towards the lake on this gorgeous spring evening with hubby.  We saw that the patio bar outside of Monti's Casa Vieja is finally open!   It's called Tempe's Front Porch (TFP for short, according to the wait staff's shirt logos).    The space is inviting, with stone half-walls, comfy outdoor sofas, a big bar, shade sails, and fire pits that came on at dusk.  We ordered all sorts of happy hour food/small plates - my fave was the short rib street tacos, we also tried the chorizo eggs, chicken lollipops (spicy).  The drinks were the highlight - a spicy Fiery Mandarin orange/cran/jalepeno concoction, and a light and refreshing cucumber Collins - I could see drinking that in July for certain.  Well, Yelp's formatting is not letting me go back and edit anything easily in this review, so I'll stop here.  I did take photos since the real thing that pushes this Front Porch over to five stars is the location (right across from Tempe Beach Park/the Waterfront) and the ambiance... you can see part of the Flour Mill and once the trees get a little bigger, this place is just going to be smoking.    Yay!  The holy grail, I hope I'm the first reviewer!  :)  Cheers!
