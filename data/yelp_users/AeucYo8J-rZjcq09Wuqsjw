I work right by this Theater and have always wanted to check out a show and see what the atmopshere was like inside. Well i finally did and im glad because i had a nice time. Snacks and drinks available. All different kinds of shows constantly going on and you wont have to break the bank to do so. Great for kids!  Upstairs and downstairs...check it out. well worth a visit.

I love this place! Good for all ages and relatively cheap, a win-win!! If you park in the heritage parking lot they win discount your parking ticket to only $3 bucks and its usually $12! another win!  We went and checked out bodyworlds and the brain, and if you have never been here, YOU have to go and check it out. Even if you have gone and you know someone who might enjoy it, i think it is the type of place you can go again and see/learn things that you missed your first time through.   We ended up on level two playing in the kids area( don't be fooled they have pretty cool stuff in there). plus, its o.k to let your inner kid out sometimes. :)  A definite must see, and i won't be surprised if i end up back here again. Very cool!

This turned out to be such a delightful surprise/experience was not starving but had my heart set on small plates and a drink or two and this place delivered just that. We got a cozy spot right next to the fireplace and some dirttyyy martinis to start things out. The vibe here is very chill and laid back. I likey. We tried some shrimp, calamari, bruschetta, lettuce wraps and my boo went for the open faced burger. I LOVED the lettuce wraps. my style for sure. Everything was tasty and flavorful and hit the spot.   Not crazy expensive either. that's always a +

my fav  thing about this place  compared to other airports i have visited is when picking someone up they never kick you out and ask you to keep moving... literally can wait as long as necessary by the pickup curb....  im a chick who is all about convenience!

Had a blast at this spot ( and not just because i whooped my b/f's ass either on the track..bhahaha)  anywho, we signed up and became members cheaper to do it that way if you think you will get the urge to race often. Member is $14 and some change and non member is $20. You sign up, pick a racing name that will permanently been yours forever and eva.. ( Sexyspeeder, right here :) ) you get a head sock you will have to wear under the Helmet, free t-shirt if you sign up also.  LADIES wear closed toe shoes... i had to borrow some of there's and lets just say i never want to wear rental shoes again.  You can race as much as you want, take breaks in between or do back to back if you choose. On Sundays they combine the tracks together so its an even longer track. it was really fun, those little karts go pretty fast ( and they do take bumping very seriously..they will pull your grown ass over and scold you like a little kid if they catch you..i know cause they gave my b/f a talkin too) they keep track of your best lap and which place you came in and you get a paper that records all this... my #1 is plastered on the refrigerator! whoop whoop.  If your looking for some competitive fun, try this place out. They also have food, drinks, rock wall, and arcade also.   Also might be a cool spot to throw a kids b-day party also!  vroom-vroom!

i first checked out the website before going here, and the website gave me the impression this place was something waayy different from what it actually is. Total let down, i was expecting to ride some good rides, when actually this place is for kids.. i mean little kids. Only two rides you can consider adult friendly, and still were not all that impressive. the one big roller coaster is alright, but really short and the "Flyer' is probably their best attraction. Would i go back?? prob not unless i took kids..if you have kids they would love it though.

i had not been inside a Chuck E Cheese for evvverrr until just a few days ago and geez it sure has changed since i was a kid!  Kids go bonkers in this place and they do a really good job of making the kids feel special and all that jazz. They have the table sections for each party and do a group birthday celebration when chuck e comes out. The birthday kids also get to go into a wind blower and try to catch a bunch of tickets.. my friends son got the $1000 ticket (only one in there) and he freaked out haha! Good place for the young kids for sure and a decently priced place to throw a bday bash so you don't break the bank.

Hands down 5 stars, did not even need to think twice about it. (this does not happen often).  Ginormous menu and low prices. We had spare ribs, orange chicken, rice and our meals also came with egg drop soup AND salad and we also got two orders of crab puffs  all for $20 freakin bucks.    everything was deeeelicious. i mean everything. nothing but silence as we ate.   The man working while we were there was just a delight, he was helpful, nice( some kid(who was clearly under the influence of something) told this poor guy his whole life story, let him use the restaurant phone and changed out $11 in change to give him dollar bills) and funny(he just had this grin on his face the whole time the kid was telling him his problems) hahahah... it was def entertainment while eating.  Also i love that it is like a fast food kind of joint, but the decor inside does not represent that.  i highly recommend!!

Meh. I've experienced better. menu not big enough for me. pretty blah.  Soju (like Korean vodka) was the best part.. that shit will have you walking around in the streets with yo' pants off.                                            *you....have.been.warned.*

took the b/f on a date here and we had a really good time. theme was nice and relaxing inside, played nice authentic Italian music. Had a bottle of wine and we shared the fish and the spinach chicken-both were delicious. We didn't have anything for leftovers, we cleaned our plates. Both entrees come with a side of pasta as well, the garlic one was really good. Service was good as well. Good place to go with someone special for a nice quiet dinner, everyone that was there were pretty much in couples. There is a bar inside as well. This is not cheap food, but it is worth it. The complimentary flaming shot of Sambuco was the perfect touch to end the dinner.. It comes with three coffee beans it in. They say you drink two which are the present and future and you leave the past behind which the third bean dignifies. I don't know about you, but i absolutely loved that saying! We will def be back again.

Went T.V shopping here and had a great experience. Lady that helped us was very helpful. Answered all questions we had to help us make the best decision and did not feel pressured at all by her. Ended up with a 60 in flat screen and are very happy with it. Applied for a line of credit with them. Nice options as well to pay your bill with them, online over the phone(is a fee) or directly in any store which is awesome! I'm all about convenience.  They do also do deliveries for you or you can take home the same day as well. Rule of thumb: if you can make it fit in your car/truck you can take it the same day or else you will have to do delivery.  Will def be back for more home supplies. Sears to me is more of a home place cannot tell you much about the clothes and all that, but for appliances and such i highly recommend.

had my first trip to a dermatologist office.  not sure if it was stress or what but my face was freaking out and it was really starting to affect my everyday mood so i finally sought out some help. I was not sure what to expect all i know is i really wanted some help and some help was needed asap. it is not your normal physician so you do not get the whole get to know you factor(at least i didnt).  i did like it though that as soon as he walked in he got right down to business. He was very nice and could tell right away how upset my face was making me. He answered every question i could think of and prescribed me things to get started that same day.   proud to say 2 weeks later i am feeling back to my conceited self again and my face is on its way to being magazine cover ready :)  Very happy i sucked it up and went to see a dermatologist.

What a find!!!  I drive by this place all the time and always mentally say "humm Jess, you should try that place" next time i am going to listen to my gut, because i was missing out!   Inside is a very cute, cozy set up. everyone is super nice here. You get complimentary won ton chips and delicious Chinese tea when you get seated( this is pretty rare). The menu is large which lead us into gluttony...and people i am NOT ashamed because everything was derrrlicious :)  edamame, ribs, angel puffs(crab puff), garlic steak, lemon chicken, honey walmut shrimp (catching my breath)..sake..more hot tea..and then cookies and chocolate for dessert....yummmm  honestly i eat Chinese/Asian/Thai A LOT, and this was one of the best places i have came across in my quest for  great Asian food.   why not five stars then you say?? well i am a fan of windows(none here), and i just can't hand out five stars like candy. But def a high four!

I was on a savage hunt for some yogurt and was determined to find the perfect spot to satisfy my craving... you know when you're craving something in particular and even though you really want it you become super picky?? yeah that was me.. we must have drove by 5 yogurt spots and i was being a brat and could not make up my mind which place i wanted to go into. When we drove past this place i was intrigued by the design  and decorations. It has a old 50 classic diner feel to it which i thought was cute. Even all  the employees were in their dorky little outfits/hats.  what is frozen custard you ask??? It is better than ice cream... it is freakin delicious! toppings are endless.. Everything from sprinkles to cap'n crunch! I got the lemon flavored custard mixed with coconut, graham crackers and butter toffee nuts.. shit was the BOMB! so effin'' good.. better than i could have though..   You can get large pint sizes to take home... they also serve hamburgers, sandwiches, strawberry shortcakes, root bear floats, French fries ..you get the idea.  Just did dessert this time.. but i will be back Nielsen's..oh yes i will be back.

Had a really good time here! Staff is very helpful. the majority of waiting time is to use the rifles... on the pistol side we got in right away(i will be back to bust out the big guns soon). Prices are not that bad, decently priced i thought. If you do end up having to wait awhile there is a lot of stuff to check out while waiting and even a little couch and snack area

So, I had to get some brake work done and found out my rotors needed to be replaced as well. I was tight on money at the time so he gave me a breakdown of what % I had left on both my front and back brakes. Went with the immediate needed brakes in the back and the rotors and agreed I would be back in 2 wks for the front ones which still had some time on them. i appreciate when I don't get the run around.... go figure right? People actually appreciate honesty and not getting hustled for their money ! Anyway, they were super helpful and had me in and out in no time. I will be back for those front brakes.... damn cars.

deserving of 5 stars for the following reasons...   1)Custom make your own burger  2) They make their own bread daily 3) Fresh ingredients you can choose and put on yourself  5)The variety in their " sauce bar" 6)The onion rings  7) The order and seat yourself thing- i likey  Fuddruckers fudding rocks!

took my maid of honor dress in to get a slit on side on the dress. Stopped in, tried it on..Measured out the slit I wanted..left my dress and came back in a few days and it was perfect. Not overpriced at all, I was actually surprised how cheap it was to get it done honestly.  I recommend and will be back if i need any alterations in the future.

Awesome Aweome Awesome !!!!  We do not do pizza night often but every now and then we do and I suggested Nellos since I have driven past it several times as in the neighborhood and I'm always into finding new spots by the house. We check out the menu online and I am in LOVE with all of their ingredient choices! I'm a woman of variety and Nellos has it. We ordered 3 small pizzas and created two of our own and also tried the Bianca pesto Pizza as well. Everything was absolutely heavenly!!! The thin crust what eggplant/artichoke one we created was my fav.... you will never get eggplant at Pizza Hut people but Nellos is def worth the splurge! I picked up our pizzas about 25 minutes later and when I arrived pizza was ready and I was in and out in no time to get back to our Sunday evening of Guitar Hero. Cute spot inside and we well def be back to check out the bar and try out happy hour!

went back and hung out at the bar and enjoyed some craft beer while waiting for pizzas we ordered to take home. I absolutely love Nellos even more than my first encounter. The people here are super friendly and there are a lot of regulars. They just make you feel so welcome. Tried the eggplant brochette while we waited for our custom ordered pizzas and the brushetta is ummm how can i explain it..great? Marvelous, splendid? Superfreakingdelish? yup superfreakingdelish works..

Have not eaten here for a few years and just went recently and always leave pretty satisfied. Carb central? Yes. sometimes do we just need to give in to our carb fix and regret it later? yes and yes.   this is a cool little spot to if your having just a chill evening, nothing special or fancy what-so-ever. Pizza, pasta, sandwiches, steak, seafood..there is a little bit of everything. ( Italian nachos are oh-so-delicious, just an FYI). i have no complaints about anything i have eaten here.   Now on to the drinks and real reason for my review... LOVE their beer selection, i love variety and they got it, from tap to bottle. I fell absolutely in love with their Orange Blossom Wheat Beer.( When i state i fell in LOVE with a beer you need to take me serious cause i am not a beer girl). Seriously, best damn beer that has EVER wet my whistle.  I will be back for the beer..fa sho! maybe as soon as on my way home from work, it's a major possibility right now.

Stop in on a whim to pick up some pizzas. Got a specialty pizza and some honey hot wings. We even ended up getting a large cheese pizza for $2 since it was a mistake by the cook..so we walked away with a lot of food but were not that impressed. The wings were a huge disappointment for my lova' ( he is a wing man) and they did nothing for him. The pizza was good and settled our rumbling stomach pains but didn't eat leftovers and leftover pizza is one of my favs..for me to pass on it was a sad morning when i usually would have went for that cold pizza which of course, is breakfast of champions.  Wompwomp   p.s it is big inside..good for kids to be loud and run around..tvs and all that..but the food was just meh...

effin delicious grub is what you will get here! Ridic amount of food ,without breaking the bank. Seriously. Got two large entree orders and three side apps to snack on all for $25, cannot beat that. You will have leftovers for sure! B/f had the Bulgogi and he loved it. I had the sweet and sour chicken, it was just as good. yummy.. no complaints at all, salad was good and their macaroni-potato salad was killer as well. The menu has Hawaiian, Korean, Chinese..all the food i cannot get enough of. We stopped in and ordered it to go, people working there and very friendly and we only had a short wait for the food. We will for sure be back, so glad i found this place...really is a hidden little treasure.

When compared to Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop the only up those places have on this joint is the atmosphere. This place is perfect for to-go orders and they even have a drive thru. You get 12 wings for around $5.50. They offer a special too of about 75 wings for $27 if you need to fill a boatload of peeps.  they also have hamburgers, hotdogs, fries, fried zucchini and salads. They have about 5 ,levels of hot, a honey hot(which is finger licking good) and a honey bbq.  i thought it was odd that their wings only came with carrots no celery...never have I gotten wings without celery. Besides that wings were very good and the sauce makes them addicting.

My go to Japanese spot when I need a fix of yakisoba STAT! It's just so good. My bf loves the fried rice as well. They have never messed up my call in orders and its always ready when I arrive. Easy, quick and delicious dinner.  The older gentleman can't help but make me smile every time I call or go in to pick up food. The first time I called I thought someone was playing a prank on me. He has a total game show host voice..lmao I absolutely love it.

Samples!!!! I ADORE samples of food while shopping ! The produce available is awesome even experimented with some new things we had never tried before. I love everything about this place. The produce, the deli and pre made foods in the meat department are all mouth watering and I end up buying way more than what i intended. Also a very decent craft beer selection too. I felt like a gourmet cook when i got home with all my specialty food and drinks :)

I went to the minute clinic at this location yesterday and i was very impressed. this was my first visit to a minute clinic and i have to admit it was probably almost better then going to my normal doctor. Given it was a weekday, so probably on weekends it would be way more packed. you go in and fill out your information on a computer and it tells you what # you are in line to be seen. i was seen in about 25 min, even this is pretty good considering even with an appt you make to see your reg doctor weeks/days in advance you still wait this amt of time or even longer.  My insurance was covered here as well, which was awesome so only had to pay my copay. the doctor was probably one of the nicest people i have ever met(seriously, so nice that it prob would have annoyed you if you weren't sick, since we all like to be babied when we are sick it didn't get to me) anyway, she really was great and got me out of their quickly and had my prescriptions sent over to the pharmacy by my house so i could leave and just go pick then up. i highly recommend going here if you need to be seen on short notice, can't believe it took me so long to discover the minute clinic.

I love Chandler Fashion Mall and the fact they have this huge B&N here makes me love it even more. I always have found what I was looking for at this location. Everything is kept pretty orderly which I can appreciate given the fact at some book stores you can have a hell of a time finding a book you're looking for just due to things being unorganized.   They always have a huge selection of "bargain priced" books. I always end up wanting/buying something from this section every time i go.

REVERSE HAPPY HOUR STARTS 9PM PEOPLE!!!! Very, very good happy hr prices.  awesome place to go this time of night when you are looking to chill and have a few drinks...from mixed drinks, beer, sake..whatever your poison is I'm sure they have it.  I just really like the atmosphere at night...the music, the indoor/outdoor bar/patio vibe they got going on here, t.v's..and the huge fish tank that serves as wall ,separating the dining area from the drunks-it all just works-plain and simple.  oh yea and the menu is pretty decent too- sorry i get a little over excited about good drink prices..  check it out peeps!

had a wonderful experience here from first drink to last bite. Atmosphere has a nice chic upscale feel to it and the lighting is nice and cozy. We waited in the nice bar while we waited for our table. The orange martini they have is just heaven. After a few of those down the hatch i tried a "keg" size glass of wine and was great as well.   This is def a steak joint, so about 90% is all about steaks but there are some salads, fish and crab options. (they are also having a lobster special right now). Lover had the prime rib and crab combo and loved it( they are apparently really known for their prime rib) i went with the crab off course and did not disappoint.   The staff was very nice and very patient and i noticed that just about everyone that works here is good looking also. just a pretty place filled with pretty people and good food!

i love throwing shit on the floor that I dont have to pick up!!! i could do without the peanuts, but i eat them just so i can throw the shell on the floor( don't judge me!) anyway.. alright beer selection on tap although there is more of a selection that comes bottled.   The BLT i had was one of the best i have ever had, they let me add and substitute whatever i wanted. It was just delicious -seriously. Lover enjoyed his burger as well and we both loved the Greek fries!  nice cool dimly lit place to escape the wonderful 112 degree heat. somehow i always "forget" drinking makes me hotter..but meh, who cares

I was in the middle of a dilemma and needed proof of something faxed to me right away and stopped in here and got what i needed within just five minutes and was outta there and back to what i needed to take care of.  The price for two piece of paper for the fax was almost $3, which while is not the cheapest considering you can get it for free at home, but beggars cannot be choosers and was happy to pay it.

absolutely wonderfully delicioouuss!!! Dilly's Deli has a very large variety in the ingredients they offer which of course led me to taking forever to put together my order( but I was creating a masterpiece here) but after I finally got it together it was freaking delicious and hit every craving I was having. I got a turkey wrap with feta, cranberries, spinach, candid walnut, avocado and even raspberry vinaigrette on the side. I know it might not sound as delicious to you as it does to me but you get the idea of the creations you can put together here.  Lover got a meat lovers sandwich and all of their soups come in a bread bowl. He tried the potato soup and had nothing negative to say about his order. Along with soup they have chips and other pasta salads you can get on this side as well.   Food smelled so dang good, I couldn't help devour the only thing i could get my hands on while I was driving which was the huge delicious pickle that came with the meal :)

Not my type of place i admit. Went here for a coworkers bday party. huge place. There are three different rooms.. hip hop, country(which is the main theme here and the biggest area) and a 80's room.   The drink prices are what made the night. We were getting drinks for a buck a piece. Gin and tonics for a buck, yes a buck.   Due to these lovely economy friendly prices i got tipsy fast and it made the night and this place a whole lot better than i think it would have been if i was sober.

i went awhile without nails since i moved and was having some trouble finding a place that i really liked( yes us women get attached to our nail tech so its hard moving on to someone new). No complaints. Quick service, decent prices. lots of pedicure chairs also. 100's of nail art designs to choose from if your into spunking up your nails(which i am) ...  glad i gave this place a shot since i had mixed emotions based on other reviews... goes to show ya only really can judge for yourself!

I L.O.V.E going grocery shopping and I love going to different stores because you can always find something different. Bashas is pretty awesome. Nice selection in both the bakery and meat departments. The babes got some really pretty slabs of prime rib and i walked away with some new cheeses and good produce. I'm somewhat of a produce snob but the selection is overall good at this location.   So to recap: Covered parking :) Good beer selection :)) Good produce, meat, and pastries :)))... umm yes I'm a definite fan.

well well well... wasn't this such a lovely surprise ! Way better than my experience at the PHX Zoo. This place is great. Kids under 3 are free.. SCORE!. Took the 2 yr niece out for a day with Auntie and Uncle and we had such a good time. You really can get super close to all the animals and there are so many different types of animals here. it was my first time seeing a white crocodile !   Side note- Thanks to whoever put the carousal right in the middle of the tour as we could not walk past it until my niece rode it- due to her screaming I RIDE HORSEY!! over and over again until she got to ride it.  Anyway, the aquarium was probably my favorite part. Such a cool setup and experience. i got to feed the sting rays and i was only able to do it once because it tripped me the F out..so i gave the rest of the shrimp to my bf so he could do it. Cool experience though! Also have a few restaurants and snack stands as you walk around as well but you can bring in your own things also and save some scrilla.  a lot of walking and a lot of dust so ladies let's remember this is not a fashion show, you are in a  big dusty/rocky circle to look at a bunch of animals, not front row at an Usher concert. Mmkay, thanks.

Non pretentious place and not overly crowded for this location which I love since I knock out my work out for the day during my lunch. prices are reasonable and lockers are only $7 a month if you need one. Lots of equipment, machines and classes to choose from. Oh, and towels are complimentary also.  I like the foam bath wash in the showers also :)

What is there not to love about this place??? Super friendly people working here and really know there stuff. I was trying to explain something I was looking for and even though I did not know the "correct" term for it she was able to figure it out with my horrible description and body movements(she would be a good Pictionary partner).  Prices are really fair and they have everrrryythhingg you could think of.  My number one spot to check out for when I'm getting costumed out.

Loved this place!! Def something worth checking out. Great architecture, and the layout is very creative as well. There are 5 studios of art to check out and all of them were nice and very interesting.. and only $3.50 to get in and walk around! nice cheap way to beat the heat for an hr or two!

Sweet potato ravioli !!!!! absolutely wonderful. Also tried the spaghetti carbonara and they did not mind adding eggplant to it for me, and it was just delicious as well.   Cute little place with an overall good food selection. They have an extensive wine list as well.  only thing that bugged the shit out of me was they had that white construction paper covering the cloth table cover and it was just annoying. i mean really? you really cant afford to change the table cloths and wash them so you don't have to use that annoying tacky paper???yucky!  okay I'm done bitchin'  overall nice spot glad i finally checked it out.

Lover went with a pinot flight and i went with the "Best in Bubbles" flight...mmmmm i love champagne. Service was very good. Our server was on the ball and  knew his stuff when it came to the menu. We shared the filet mignon and the fish and everything was very good.   It is a very popular place so make reservations so you're not waiting around! just a friendly tip from yours truly.

i wooove you Roaring Fork !!!!  atmosphere is nice, dark, romantic and cozy :) food is f*%$ing fantastic! me and the lover ordered three entrees between the two of us because we couldn't make up our minds and everything just sounded so dang good.  starter: green chili carnitas- comes with tortillas and it was just awesome. dinner: beef short rib, rainbow trout and 1/2 rack of the Dr pepper baby back ribs. also accompanied with green chili mac n cheese, cilantro rice, green beans and mashed potatoes! Everything was just superb( and i never use this word) the trout comes topped with brown butter and almonds and it was just a party in my mouth. hands down probably the best fish i have ever had! the ribs were good as well and the short rib was very tender and melted in your mouth.   unfortunately no room for desert because our gluttony got the best of us but we saw the desserts other people had and they looked fattening and tasty.  all of this accompanied by shots of tequila and martinis and taken care of by the sweetest attentive server!  Roaring Fork you are my new love, I'm so glad we met last night, you totally rock my world!  p.s thurs-sun they have a great deal . pick and entree and three sides all for $18. you are welcome :)

From the outside it is totally understandable to have a different idea about what this place has ti offer. Walked in and it was totally different from what i pictured looking from the outside.   Very nice, low lighted and nicely decorated place. Service was awesome and the menu/drink selection is nice as well.  Everything was delicious no complaints and all just that i did not have any room left for dessert(which i picked out even before i picked my entree).. fried plantain with coconut ice-cream, people.  I will be back for that damn dessert. believe that.

Cheap drinks..make that cheap strong drinks, Christmas lights coming out the wazoo, live music, quick and speedy bartenders, indoor/outdoor kick it area and a nice blended crowd. This time of year you cannot tell what a true dive bar this is since the xmas lights make it ohh soooo purrrddyyyy BUT it is a dive bar, a wonderful decorated dive bar that can't help but put you in a cheery mood :)

Probably one of the greatest Italian spots i have been too. Food is awesome, staff is friendly and attentive. Good atmosphere. Menu is pretty extensive and wine list is good as well. Nice place for a romantic dinner with someone special, low lights and good music!

. This place is simply fantastic. Its beautiful inside and out. The food is just as beautiful as the scenery. service was excellent from the start and they even had a car ready to take us home when we were done since we showed up in a cab.   The menu changes which means i will be back to experience some more 5-star cuisine. Go here, you will love it.   Very romantic

FINALLY made it byt to peep out Ruth's Chris!!  It was game night (and it was super packed)  but we were able to catch a bar table right away which didn't bother us since we wanted to be able to see the game as well. Nice bar area, great service , awesome menu and delicious food or and strong tasty drinks ...  I don't normally eat red meat but i made exception and had a bite of bf's (didn't help it had toasted blue cheese crumbs on it) and it was a orgasm in my mouth. You love steak? You will love Ruth's Chris. i tried a stuffed chicken that was cooked perfectly. the sides you choose are def large enough to share so we tried a few and enjoyed them all.

legit beer selection both on tap and in bottles to purchase and create your own six pack as well... and on my trip here i did both of these things... and loved everything.     The food selection is nothing like the beer selection.. But I needed something and my eye caught the hummus which turned out to be absolutely delicious... I could have sat there and drank beer and ate hummus all afternoon... yummmmmm

People seem to have a lot of bad things to say about this place but Im just not one of them. i do not eat Sushi so this review is based off other menu items. Rockin shrimp, pineapple wontons, garlic edamame, spicy green beans etc..oweeiii i am in heaven. Sake bombs and all this food around me i will leave one happy girl which i do every time. I give the servers major credit for keeping a smile on their faces. You get  mix crowd at this location...drunks, loud people, quiet people, couples etc...so you have to understand the servers here deal with  lot and i have no complaints about my service the times i have been.  I love sake and i love the apps here. Delicious.

Finally made my way over to four peaks, and left nice and tipsy, off all the different beers i had to try..so all in all i can say i left very happy :)  Service was great, and i love the inside of this place.   I looked over the menu it is "typical" bar food in my opinion, HOWEVER not so typical was hummus so of course i had to try it, and it was flippin fantastic!!! ( yes im a hummus whore,  I have to try a new one every chance i get)  Great happy hour prices, i'll be back fa sho!

after several fatburgers i feel it is still to come clean and admit i have become a really big fan. i have never had a bad burger. This is my favorite and only place that i do eat a burger at.   i was a hater at first yes. But Fatburger worked its way into my heart and i admit they know how to make a delicious f-ing burger here!!   Consistency in their food is solid here, and nothing better than being able to count on a place where you will always get a good meal...over and over again.  Kudos Fatburger

We had a great experience here. The menu had waayy more than i expected when i thought "brewery". 9pm-close is reverse happy hour and that was all we ordered off of and everything was fantastic. crab and artichoke dip *(req to have it with the bread instead of the cracker, TRUST me),  and yes i will admit we actually had two orders of the dip..it was that scrumptious! shrimp with chili sauce, pork sliders..all yummy! The have combo meals as well on the HH menu. The happy hour choices are great. We will be back to try the real menu as well, i looked it over and it is pretty intriguing.  We had the beer sampler. No this place dies not have the widest selection of beers but the ones they have are pretty good. Check out the seasonal when you go...they also have a huge list of mixed drinks and wines as well.  Atmosphere is nice, low lights, music, t.v's upstairs, outside seating also. Service was just o.k. he left us alone(ignored), but its o.k. we were just fine being left alone in our little love bubble.

Took my lova' on a date here and we had such a good time ! I was impressed and the whole experience was way different from what i anticipated.   I Bought our tickets online. We got there early and were able to wait in a lounge they have open before the main show. There is a drink minimum, so if you are looking for a cheap date night then i suggest you look elsewhere. We loved the atmosphere, had good seats, service was great also for the place being packed. You can order food as well, (fruit and cheese platter was awesome!)  So glad we came here and I will from now on be checking frequently to see who is performing. Awesome place if you're looking for a little change  from the normal night out.   and yes, seats are close together, but if you don't like people then why are you going to watch one make jokes??

Tasty Kabob well surpassed my expectations!!  i walked in and it was exactly like the previous reviews had said about it...desolate and quiet and yes the almighty Pita Jungle (which is right next door) was much more busy. Not sure which one of these establishments was here first but these two places RIGHT next door to each other are for sure rivals. Tasty kabob is a family owned restaurant though, and the quality and taste of the food completely represents that. Everything was freaking delicious. Let me break it down for ya right quick folks::  ATMOSPHERE: place is decorated really nice inside, perfect place for an intimate dinner. They had Persian music playing as well which i loved. The decorations, music and food all flowed together wonderfully. SERVICE: top notch. The owners are their walking around (i assume it's them..you know they give off that owner-y- vibe) and our waitress was just a little basket of knowledge and sunshine! FOOD: hummus was one of the best i have had. Menu is fairly large and honestly everything looked good. We had the chicken kabob and steak kabob and the meat was REALLY tender and flavorful. Order came with a MASSIVE amt of yummy rice. (also have the option doing 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad if you desire). They also did a special order for me which was not on the menu. wanted a special vegetable Kabob and they whipped it up just to my liking.. gotta love that! didn't have room for the ice-cream but hear its delish! DRINK: wine and beer- nice selection PRICE: reasonable. Two people, $52. pretty good for apps, two drinks and two entrees.   give this underrated place some of your time one day if you happen to be in the area, i highly doubt that you will be disappointed.

Well yesterday i was a total chicken junkie. I wanted more after I devoured 4 pieces. Seriously the best grilled chicken I think I have ever had. Yes, i had major munchies but this is beside the point. It was seriously beyond satisfying and I need more in my system this week. Beautiful red skin and delicious juicy interior. I'm freaking hooked.  You get two choices people, just TWO. If you can only have two options on your menu, you know it has to be freaking fantastic and it is. They have perfected the grilled bird and I am so grateful I stopped in.  Beans, tortilla, salsa, chicken...this girl couldn't have asked for more.    Sometimes less is truly more.  Seriously BOMB!

Unfortunately i was not cheering OPA! After my visit here. I heard great things, and i just did not experience these great things.  1) I have had better hummus 2) I hate when the sides that come with the entree are better than the entree itself- this happened here 3) I enjoyed the wine more than the food, and when my tummy is not happy, well.. i am just not a happy girl. We are team my stomach and I and we both agreed that we have experienced better together.

This place is just adorable and fantastic. Surprised the wonderful bf here for his bday dinner and they had us seated in a nice little romantic corner in the garden :) Everything we had was soo good and we really enjoyed the fruit and cheese platter they have as an appetizer and went awesome with our champagne :)  The menu is creative and from what I hear does change often which is very cool. Can't wait to go back!

Was highly disappointed with this place after hearing good things... the good things were lies I tell ya, all lies. This fish was just awful and some of the saltiest stuff I have ever put to my lips. I didn't eat what I bought and I won't be going back. Long John Silver's looks like gold compared to this place.

three words: Pre Paid Electric.  I love SRP and could not complain even if i tried to. They have a pre paid electric option and of course i jumped right on that. No surprise bill at the end of the month, you pay what you want as the month goes on $10 here $50 here, whatever you want/need to put on. You keep a nifty little box in your house that manages your monthly usage. Even breaks  down the usage by hour and day. I love knowing EXACTLY how much i am spending. You get a card to go with the box and you can load the card at any local SRP express location( in grocery stores) and insert the card into your box at home and BAM just like that bill is paid.   i don't know about you but I'm all about convenience :)

So glad Tempe has an area like this... a few miles down Mill and you feel like you're in another town. Nothing but green everywhere and water..love it!!  Went to the batting cages... for $1.25 you get 14 pitches...   you got pools...lake..basketball/tennis courts you can even pay to join games i believe..  just an all around cool place for some physical activities. And cheap at that!

The truth???  I've been here twice this week :)  Delicious! I'm in love with the pulled pork entree with their hot bbq sauce. It's just fantastic. A plus also is their coleslaw is made w/o mayo which made me very happy and is great with the pork. They have a huge menu with lots of options you are sure to find something you will like. The sides for me in general are just ok to be honest but when I come here I come for the meat anyway.  My boyfriend loves their ribs and also their fried zucchini are huge and cooked just right.    Im a regular now and plan on keeping it that way for my pulled pork munchies

oh Big Lots... one of those places that is rough looking from the outside but you can find some decent cheap shit inside.  This is def a place that is judged by its cover but everyone likes to save money and they really do have cheap stuff here. Seriously ..food, snacks, kitchen cleaners, toilet paper .. all the necessary little things you need at the house.. FOR CHEAP. ( im a bargain deal slut, i admit it).  Also bought a futon from here and was very well priced and its of very good quality too (for a futon). They have a lot of furniture for low prices. Wander in here if you happen to pass by and have some time to kill. Bet ya 5 bucks you won't come out empty handed!

Great pizza! Light but filling, super fresh homemade ingredients that you can taste and just delicious! It does get busy but we were able to snag a table around 1pm so some of the lunch crowd was starting to die down. they are very fast here and servers take good care of you. The caprese and Margherita pizza are fabulous!

You don't need me to write a story since as you can see from the other two hundred and something reviews that this place clearly rocks. Classy, sexy, tasty, delightful, scrumptious, romantic, plush...it's the type of place that makes you want to walk around with an expensive glass of cognac..Which we did...  Lover said the crab cakes here where the best he had ever had, calamari was on point. They have a goat cheese spinach salad that makes my mouth water and the steak was juicy, tender and cooked exactly how we ordered it.  Love!

Overall a pretty nice stadium. The TGIF overlooking the field is a pretty cool concept and of course the pool. Got to love as well that they can close/open the roof. So even if it is torturing hot outside, you can still be cool and watch the game.  Other than that, all your ordinary ballpark favorites can be found of course. These days for two beers and a snack its more expensive to go to a game then to the strip club...so consider maybe tossing a few beers back at one of the spots close to the stadium before the game..

Stopped in here on my bday for some drinks which happened to be Memorial Day, so we had the entire place to ourselves which was perfect. This place is just sexi, sexi, sexi !!  Cuddling in a private intimate booth, Rose Martini and champagne bubbles led to kisses and photos and an insanely delicious butterscotch dessert with a candle for wish making all while taking in tasteful cool music and surroundings.  We will be back when I'm not on a liquid diet to really give the food a tasting.   Ladies: We all love "bathroom pics" and this place has a pink bathroom with mirrors galore. I had a field day in here by myself- totally random photo shoot paradise

From here on out this will be my go to spot when i get my Mexican cravings! Lovely atmosphere both indoors and out on the patio. The prices are for sure unbeatable and the quality of food is excellent. I'm talking plates (big plates) starting at 9 bucks. Service was good and they are very accommodating to make your order just the way you want it. Whole list of exotic margaritas also...and i love free shit (especially if its food)so you know the chips and salsa that came out when we sat down put a big smile on this girls face.  Good for family, date night, gossip time with the girls etc..  muy delicioso !

First buffet i have been to that had hummus!! The variety in food at this buffet was awesome.... you can have a six course meal and not have the same thing twice.  About $30 a person, A little pricey, yes but it is Vegas, it is a huge buffet. Just go super dooper hungry to get your money's worth!

Stopped in here for some drinks after some shopping and was SUPER impressed with the beer selection at this place! They have a HUGE selection; you are bound to find something to fall in love with here. I love going to places and being able to try a new beer that i have never had before and even better they had one of my favs that is really hard to come across...double score!!  inside and outside seating, bar seating as well. Did not eat during this visit but i did look over the menu and they had a lot to choose from and some things did catch my attention.  i will be back !

I love books. Absolutely love them. I don't care how advanced we get with technology i hope books never go extinct. Seriously.   I loved this store and will definitely be back here...a lot. I ended up spending over an hour just walking around and checking out all the different sections and fell in love.Ended up with a handful of books that i needed to choose from but i did walk away with 3 new books that i just had to have. I love the environment here as well as the vast selection of books. If you are a book lover you will love Changing Hands, it's wonderful.

I usually do not eat at chain restaurants since i love trying out new places and seeing what other places have to offer..but sometimes i just get the craving for this place and it never lets down.  From crab puffs, calamari, lettuce wraps all their starters hit the spot! Never have any complaints with anything i have ordered..and if you're a picky eater you are bound to find something since the menu is large. Shrimp with candid walnuts is prob my fave!   Service is pretty good at this location..it is right by  ASU so it can be hit or miss on being really busy or not..   p.s Reverse happy hour is ONLY at the bar, they have some things that are not on the regular menu that you can only order if you sit at the bar

Huge portions (i asked for a side of artichokes and they brought me a whole damn plate :) ) and i love the creativity in the food display and the huge variety in the menu/drinks as well. Everything was great ..chicken and bacon waffles, vanilla waffles, crispy potatoes etc....yummmmm  A def must stop when you are in Vegas baby!

Anyway, we arrived and without reservation we were seated immediately. Everything about our dining experience was excellent. Our waitress was awesome. It was my lovahs 30th bday dinner and she went above and beyond and even offered to take pics for us when she saw me struggling to do a photo shoot myself. We picked a trio of bruschetta and they were alllll delish! My honey got the sweet potato ravioli and omigod i couldn't stop opening my mouth so he would feed me another bite. I had the risotto which was good but his ravioli was just downright fantastic! We had champagne and they come in cute flutes and also a bday dessert with a candle on the house!!!   The ambiance here is great... good music and lighting. We will be back. I def def def recommend! (no stuttering prob, just expressing you should DEF try it out ) :)

Stopped in here to get some grub to go. They have a large menu. We got some spring rolls, Pad Thai, Thai BBQ chicken and chicken satay. I love me some Pad Thai but it could have been a little hotter for me and i got it at medium. It's hard to judge since each Thai place is different with spice but Hot would be a safe choice here if you like a little kick. Food was ready pretty quick and order was hot, correct and delicious.   Nice decor and pretty big restaurant altogether.

This place is pretty cool. We went by on a Saturday and was pretty busy. Had live music outside in the bar/patio area. we sat inside in the bar/lounge area and there was also a full dining room as well on the other side. Fun atmosphere, music, TV's. Service was really good as well. what i really liked was the extensive menu.. im a girl who is all about options and this menu gave me more than enough. Apps, salads, burgers, sandwiches, steak, chicken, seafood..pretty much every category was on this menu. i highly recommend the wings..they were absolutely delicious. The sweet sauce they come with was effin' addicting you wanted to find something else to did it in after the wings were devoured just to eat some more of the yummy sauce. We got to fish entree's..came with warm bread and oil as well and salads before the meal. Everything was really good. im really picky about my fish( its something you either get right or horribly wrong) and it was good which if they can get fish right everything else should be just as good. def will be going back here to try out other things on the menu..and those damn addictive wings swear they put crack in the sauce..

Sooo.. me and the boyfriend decided to take up skateboarding and we checked this park out over the weekend. We pulled up and i let out a sigh of relief when i saw all the younger kids( didn't want to eat dirt in front of a bunch of pro's). This place is nice .open till 10:30pm. lots of space and is good for a variety of ages. Older kids came as well and its nice because everyone just kinda hangs out together. Lots of bowls and rails. This will def have to be our weekend spot to get our practice on.

this is the place to go when you are low on change in your pockets and just looking to get full on mediocre food. buffet style food, nothing super spectacular. food is what you would expect, beans, rice, tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, taquitos, tamales etc. salad bar was far from a salad bar, and decided to stay away from that area, did not look to appealing so dont think i missed out on anything there.they do have servers walking around to get you things you need once you are seated which is nice. the dessert was better than the actual food. So yes i got full here but dont think i will be craving this place anytime soon and begging to go back.

No complaints! i came for juice and juice is what i got! They have a nice variety from juices to smoothies and also shots like ginger/lemon shots. If you're looking for something healthy and quick this is a good spot to grab a nice drink from. prices are pretty comparable to other similar juice bars.   Next time I'm in this area I will be stopping by!

thhheee best Boba place i have yet to find here in the valley! Enormous amount of flavors and possibilities are endless if you get creative and mix some flavors... you can get it in milk tea form, slush or snow. Also i like that besides Boba they offer the little jelly things as well. they do have a couple snacks to grub on but the drinks are what dominate.  love it here just love it. I stumbled upon it by accident and i fell in love. You know what they say ...love happens when you are least expecting it and not looking for it. :)

Def a fan of jackrabbits due to the music they play. All hip-hop.The first night i went it was packed, not sure if it is always that busy or just becasue J-Cole happened to show up that night. People dancing everywhere instead of just standing around like at some clubs, the drinks were pretty expensive, think i spent around 40 bucks just on two drinks, which is pretty damn high in my book. ( for sure pregame before you head here, so at least you have a good buzz going so you dont need to buy so many drinks). Overall its a fun place, good music and good mix of people.

My guy loves him some meat and this place is a go-to spot for some nice cuts of meat. They have a lot to choose from here. Specialty items as well in their fresh and frozen section. You can also shop in their seasoning and sauce section and add some new flavors you don't already have in your pantry. We got to slabs on ribs for around $50. He loved them. Im not a huge meat person but i did try a few and they were delish.   I will be back to pick up some of their special chicken they have !  Decent beer selection too- not excellent in regards to other places you can get good craft beer but still decent.

It's hard to find places during the weekdays that are open past 9 or 10pm and this place is open till 2am !! There menu is not your average Greek food menu. They have a very big variety and you are bound to find something you like. they even have some American and Italian dishes as well. it was just the two of us but we ordered for about 5 people because we wanted to try so many different things. Hummus, eggplant, souvlaki, steak kabobs, even the manicotti. Everything was very good, and they have a large selection in wine and specialty drink also.

I'm a Juicy Bitch so of course i had to check out the store while i was in Vegas. The girls in the store were very helpful and nice. The store was laid out nicely and had a nice selection in everything from clothes, jewelry ( LOTS AND LOTS of charms)and even kids and baby stuff. Not as many purses as i would expect but regardless i was still in heaven.  Go Juicy!

YAY for another good find!!!   Saketini has great service, wonderful chill atmosphere and a large food/drink menu. They have seating at the sushi bar, seating at the regular bar and then also table seating. They have daily deals..yesterday (Monday) was 1/2 off sake bombers..can i get a WHOOP WHOOP?!?  They have an extensive sushi menu with both cooked and raw sushi.  We tried the Firecracker and they even let us add avocado into it. It was baked to perfection and we absolutely loved them. If you're not a huge raw sushi fan there are multiple options that consist of cooked sushi and whoever is serving you will be more than happy to suggest what you might like best. They also have a full non-sushi menu as well.  Shrimp tempura and edamame were delicious as well.  Four rounds of sake and three plates all for $37 duckets!  Check Saketini out !. Good food, service and atmosphere. You will find a deal that will work with you.. happy hour or reverse happy hour ,you 're bound to find something that will fill your belly with deliciousness and a drink that will warm ya up!

Its just a big bar- plain and simple. I love the chill atmosphere. You can watch a game, play ping pong(for free), play beer pong, darts or pool. It's like going and drinking and playing all the games you would at home, but just in a big bar.   Nice variety in beers especially the selection they have on draft. Games and alcohol are the best duo ever so how can i complain? Everything we ate was very tasty as well.   good place to get out of the house for awhile to chill and just fuck around- i like.

the menu here is just ridiculous... took me forever to decide what the hell i wanted. Endless options(which i love) it's just when you're hungry everything looks so effin' good . Service was great.. there was a little wait..but it was def worth it. I had a really tasty buffalo chicken wrap..Which i ended up taking half home it was a good amount of food. the breakfast also all looked great and b/f really enjoyed his. they really do have pretty much anything you could want also have fun drinks..Bloody marys, mimosas, root beer floats etc. We checked out the bakery and everything looked delicious.  Everything is affordable not overpriced by any means and large portions. Very cool place, love the menu we will def be going back again. make sure to check out the hall of fame/shame to see good ol' Adam Richmond's mug up there from Man Vs Food.

I recently put the ciggs down and went vapor and HQ helped me make the transition super easy. They were beyond helpful and answered all of my 50,000 questions and showed me how to work everything. I have had zero problems with my equipment and i couldn't be happier. After 3 weeks my lover decided to quit smoking as well and i took him right to HQ and got him started as well on a starter pack.   We both used the Yelp offer HQ offers. $40 for only $25.  Great deal, great shop, great people

I had a positive attitude when i came here for dinner, i really wanted to like the food but it was just a total let down. go figure eh' ? You can't have an establishment that has fun games and good food under one roof. The menu and food can (in my opinion) be looked at like an upgraded Applebee's menu. B/f steak was not cooked the way he ordered it, the Nachos we had to start were the best part of the meal. ( But nachos are good at any sports function so you don't need to be on Iron Chef to whip up a good batch of em').. i got the BLTA sandwich and honestly how can you mess up such a classic sandwich???? i was just overall not impressed at all and even kind of mad that i had to pay for it...

Great place to leave your car parked while traveling! They take you to the airport and are very prompt and fast. Also if you call when you get off the plane they will make sure they send someone right over to pick you up to take you back after you get your bags! WAYYY cheaper than parking at the airport and you can always find a coupon!

$2 sake during happy hour + me = pure bliss. We had a really good time here. had Drinks and apps and everything was very good. Spring rolls are bomb! okay due to the fact that sake was only $2  a round lead me to learn the hard way that it is possible to drink to much sake...let's just say the next morning was one of those where recollections of the night before trickle in slowly throughout the day..but all in all i was very pleased with my experience. Did not do dinner but dinner looks very appealing and we will def be back to try. Cool, mellow atmosphere. Pretty big place and good size crowd as well. Service was good as well, they do ask you before they seat you if you will be drinking and they give you a wristband to wear. def recommend trying this place during happy hour!

I love Tempe marketplace!! cute shops, good eats, cool drinks.   Good for just wandering around or sitting and people watching. they also have live music on Fridays and sometimes Saturdays as well.  Just a cool set up and cool place to hang out on a nice day or evening.

besides o.k alcohol prices during happy hour... the food has disappointed me more than once now... I'm sorry Applebees but we are officially breaking up. we had our moments but they have come and gone...disappoint me once and I will forgive you but twice then i just become a bitter girl that I even spent my money here...  goodbye Applebees and hello Chili's !!( i know its mean, but breakups are hardly ever nice )

THAIREFFIC !!!!! I slapped myself on the wrist for not trying this place out sooner, considering I have drove past like a gazillion times. Dropped in and ordered a bunch of grub to take back to the crib and we were totally satisfied and happy. Not that pricey plus the food and portions well exceed the price and service is really quick as well. You can dine in also but they don't serve alcohol so my couch and a beer that night sounded much better..anyway I'm a sweet and sour pork freakazoid and I had the best I think I've ever had from here. You get to choose from 0-5 how spicy you want anything and everything you order and the way they cook there food is just delicious. Pad Thai is freaking awesome  too!   If you happen to drive by and want some Thai, don't be shy go and give it a try..trust me it's really good I wouldn't lie...

if you are currently counting your daily calories then this warning is issued for you:: DO NOT GO HERE... i warned you! what you do with this information is now in your hands.  Call ahead if you get impatient waiting because you will have to wait here. You can sign in there and they will text you when your table is ready which is pretty cool. They have live music so it is really loud (makes sense a text msg if prob the only way to find you). We had a drink while we waited for our table, they even have a cute little area with couches where you can wait. Loved the loud and informal nature of this place.   Menu is ginormous as well as the portions. We got a 1/2 order of fried pickles and onion strings to start ( the 1/2 portions look to me like what i would consider a full portion,, just ridiculous amounts of food).  both got the baby back ribs. All your normal bbq fixins' to choose from to go with your entree. order came with this biscuits that i swear tasted like they had sugar on them with an apple butter of some sort that was just sinful.   Everything was great, had no room for dessert and i didn't even finish 1/2 my baby back order.   this place will be an every now and then splurge as i think i am still burning off the calories .

Cilantro lime hummus?? bomb!! fish and chips?? F*%#ing fantastic!!Beer?? two thumbs up! Atmosphere?? very chill..love the setup!! Service?? good considering the poor thing was basically running the whole area by herself, but still had a smile each time we waved her down for some help.  Great find..i will be checking in here soon.

what is there to say that has not already been said about Whole Foods? This place freaking rocks. Pricey? yes. Could i spend my whole paycheck here in one trip? Yes. But you cant put a price on love people. Just go here and you will see for yourself. awesome meat, seafood, beer, wine selection.  SUPER creative and cute little desserts. They even have a bar inside with rotating beers on tap. Just go. just look at everything. Just go.

When I feel like switching up my usual shopping routine this is a good place for me to go. i can find things here that i cannot get at frys or Safeway. Pre packaged things are nice when I know I'm going to be lazy in the kitchen or if i have a picky eater to deal with.  Make sure when you are buying things you check the expiration date. Things will not last as long because they are freshly packaged. Gotta make sure you will eat them and not throw your money away letting them sit in your fridge to long.   Good prices for good unique items. One of the only places I can get mango salsa, kale chips, Rose Champagne and avocados all in one stop :)   only open till 8 or so!

Nice lunch spot right in downtown. They do serve breakfast now as well, and i hear it is really good too.   A lot of seating, few tv's and large windows to downtown people watch as well. Quick service and a nice variety in their menu too. You got pizza, calzones, salads, pasta and of course focaccia sandwiches. You can also do 1/2 orders with your sandwich and get a side of a pasta the normal order comes with your choice of chips and drink.I tried the Caprese sandwich and it was pretty good, i loved the fresh ingredients ( reason for the 4th star). My sandwich was just over $10, but the fresh ingredients again were worth it. My peeps that accompanied me enjoyed their pasta as well with no complaints.   Chill, relax environment which on your lunch hour is just what you need sometimes.

Probably my new fav Greek spot(just wish it was closer to my side of town, but SO worth the drive).  Where to even start.... i guess by saying that everything was f*%$ing delicious! i mean everything.. the hummus, Greek fries, gyro club sandwich, the chicken, rice, potatoes...just fantastic!  i will be back again very, very soon.   A lot o food so be prepared to take home boxes. Also they guys that work here are very nice...so if you have questions about any the food they will be more than happy to explain them to you and not get annoyed while doing it :)  why are you still reading this.. just go eat here already! you won't regret it. Cross my heart and hope to die.

I work downtown Phoenix and this place has helped me multiple times with whatever I need to get done. I will drop my car off before work and they will take care of the oil change, tires or whatever I need done while I am working and call me when its ready to be picked up. Easy peasy.   Get off of work with all my car maintenance needs taken care of...yes, I love this location.

i know people love this place, but I'm sorry i just feel like it is an overrated chain. Even our waitress was like," no I would not recommended that" i mean what does that tell you? she literally had something negative to say about 4 different dishes we asked her about.  we appreciated the honesty and left after we finished our drinks and I never just walk out of restaurants. I just love my mom and pop places for Asian, Japanese and Chinese food...Benihanas just cannot seem to impress me.  At least i tried right?

So glad we gave this place a shot. Atmosphere was just what we were looking for.... nice atmosphere, busy and filled with  a variety of people and age groups and played good music as well. Place is pretty nice inside as well (and the fire pit /waterfall doohickey, they have outside is perfect to sit in front of if you have to wait for a table).  Everything we had was really good, no complaints at all about the food( did not do much sushi so i cannot disagree or agree with other people comments about it) but...  calamari and edamame were delic.  side note: one thing that bugged this shit out of me, is out waitress was reeeallly slllooww. we ordered drinks and our apps at the same time and apps came out before our drinks even did( she meant well, she just seemed somewhat as if she kept forgetting she was at work or something)   got the Sake sampler which was good and a few other rounds of sake followed, all were mucho tasty.  We ordered the "dreamboat" and apparently when they make this they can only do it is you place two orders of it. The thing is fricken huge...seriously i felt guilty with all that food in front of me..but it was delic and had two big boxes of crap to take home as well.   i recommend trying this place out(if you get the slow chick, just boss her around.. she seems to respond to it really well.)

I always had good experiences with the location in Tucson but I was just not feeling the grub we picked up from here. Maybe it was the fact they messed up our order? Yes, this could be a big reason but also they lacked in heat (temp) and just didn't really do all that much for my taste buds.  maybe it was a dud pack I ordered??  The positive: the celery and carrot sticks were on point

sayyyy waatttt?!?! five stars??? yessum boys and girls, this little joint is this shit and i am in love!  Loved everything about my experience with Genghis. Atmosphere, service, the food, prices, drinks...  you get the picture  $1 sake..And $5 sake bombers..Thank you Genghis.  To be able to create my own bowl with all the veggies, meat, seasoning and sauce i wanted it just put me on cloud nine. It's great because you go can go back time and time again and never make the same bowl twice. ( i want to go right now, who's down???)  Perfection is the formula when me and Genghis Grill combine. scrumdiddilyumptious.

If you're in the Tempe market place this is a good little spot to stop and enjoy a nice caffeinated beverage. Nice menu and lots of variety with flavors. Tried the iced peach latte and it was fricken delicious. boyfriend even had one and loved it and he is not a coffee fan at all. Its location is perfect as well. Right by the waterfall, so at night it's nice to sit here and enjoy the pretty color changing waterfall and but of course people watch..duh!  check it out..good stuff.

you like to drink? you like variety in you alcoholic beverages? You like to save money? then Bevmo should be your next destination for all your drinking needs. Nice clean location. I personally prefer Bevmo over Total Wine. Bevmo ended up having the Coconut Ciroc that i was on the hunt for, and for that reason alone they won my love. I love this place because you can always find something you have never seen/heard of before, and they have all kinds of yummy goodies as well that go perfect with whatever your drink of choice is.

i would like to just take a moment and say how much Bevmo has grown on me...(deep sigh).... Bevmo, you just have everything i need to get my buzz and munchies on and you don't know how much that means to me. (tear)  The lover and I decided to tap into our beer side and see what really turns us on and i must admit.. we had SO much fun just wondering around and looking at all the different kinds of brews that are out there. It was like Halloween but with beer. Got home with our sack full of goodies and of course had to try all of them that night and now we are officially drinkers of non-domestic beers.  I am very open to other cultures.. i mean how could i not beer their alcohol content is so much higher than ours.. makes us Americans look like a bunch of lightweights.  Thanks Bevmo, your such a good pal.

we were drawn in by the appearance and the music coming from this place as we were walking by so we decided to give it a shot. Overall it was alright, nothing i think i will be craving anytime soon. Drinks were okay..food the same. food seemed really heavy and not on the very healthy side..which i prefer. one really good thing here was our waitress she was awesome, but other than that this place did not really knock my socks off.

A disappointment. Chicken finger dinner consisted of two pathetic chicken strips and soggy fries. Bf had the catfish and was not blown away by it. Nothing was that great. we tried this place before and we were no impressed either times. Only decent thing was the okra.  Sorry Cajun Seafood Corner but this just isn't going to work between us.

so the first step is admitting you have a problem right? I admit I drive by places that are right by my house and then I try them eventually and find out i have been missing out on spectacular food all along. (shaking finger at self)  PHO HOW I LOVE THEE !!!! go here. get pho. love it. go back and  repeat several times a week. I do.

Nice upscale restaurant. It is on the small side so you should probably make reservations on typical busy night..fri, sat etc. They are very attentive here though and service is very good.   Its not your normal restaurant or portion size when it comes to the food. The plates are small and they recommend 5 dishes to share between two people. (yes it is also expensive). The menu is also not that large either and they do not have the typical ingredients you might not be used too so it is def an experience you should try just once.  Everything was very good, ambiance was nice and romantic and the wine selection is phenomenal.  p.s try the dessert  wine sampler!

Absolutely in love with Pita Jungle now! Nice relaxing low key place to get a bite to eat. Walked it and picked out wherever we wanted to sit. Nice selection of gyros, salads, pizza's etc. Service was great. My sister whp is picky as hell ordered a salad that did ended up not being what she thought it was and they exchanged it for something else she wanted without any problems. I was willing to pay for both, but they were awesome about it and exchanged it with no charge! Sometimes you might get a waiter/waitress who would act bitchy about this and given the fact they were so cool about it, def earned them extra brownie points. Everyone enjoyed their food and the pesto pizza is fan.tas.tic. Non greasy food that you actually feel good about eating.   Glad i checked this place out..great prices, good food and service.

How have a not written this review yet?! SHAME on me!  I love Suite 301.  I have a good time every time i end up here. There is just something about this place that is different from the other typical clubs in the area and Scottsdale as well. The vibe here is just laid back. You have a little bit of everyone on the crowd. People dressed up and people dressed down and the ones who fall somewhere in the middle. There really is no judgment at this place and that's hard to find. its nice to be able to dance and drink around a bunch of people and not feel out of place, judged etc. Of course the people make the atmosphere, so i guess just cool people end up here :)  my fav part of 301 you ask? Why the rooftop of course!  Drink, dance, sit, smoke, look around. I love that roof.  Thursdays are two for one. And Fridays are always good here as well! drink prices are pretty good also. they usually have a special up until 11 or something also.

check mic, one-two..I am one mo fo' that loves her pho and this place is da bomb jus' so ya kno and the prices are super low! ( ya like that ish huh?!)  but for real there is nothing like a wonderful bowl of pho and this place has it. Wonderful soup with all the extra normal trimmings and its always more than i can eat in one sitting(leftovers are my lunch today ..hurry up 1pm!!)  Staff is friendly and service is quick. Also have tried the egg rolls which are very good and the b/f who is a short rib enthusiast says this place has the best ones he has yet to come across. so from pho to even mo'  Pho Van is spot on!

WHOOP WHOOP !! My new go to spot for extensions!  Lots of variety...in both types of extensions and wigs as well. Decent price for the quality of the product.   Looking for a new spot to add new styles to your collection or just looking to maybe switch up your look a lil bit and have fun with the different colors ..check this place out!  p.s it was my first time buying extensions and the girl was very helpful in making sure i got the perfect match for me.

I love how informal this place is. Peanuts are not one of my favorite things, but i love eating them here just because i can throw the damn shell on the floor.. for some reason it brings such joy to me.   I have heard the argument Logan's was before Texas Road house and vice-versa... both are good in my book, but each have a little something different to offer so you gotta try each one out and see the differences for yourself. Service was really good, food all came out exactly how we ordered it and fairly quick.   Had the potato skins to start(you feel like your gaining weight just looking at them, but damn they are good)... someone had the tilapia, another had these like chicken sandwiches, another had the steak(yum) and i had the baby back ribs which were perfection! The meat fell right off the bone. You can choose from about 15 sides and you get two with your entree.. mac n cheese, potatoes, sweet potatoes, coleslaw, veggies etc.. we all really enjoyed everything. Can't tell ya about the dessert to full to get any. Also try one of the Hard iced teas... it was a  party in my mouth ..refreshing and tasty  p.s oh and bathrooms were very clean.. always a thumbs up for that!

LOVE this place!! I love going to new grocery stores and just wandering and checking out the things they have, and this place has really good stuff. Not your normal grocery store and thats what makes it so unique. really good deals as well. lots of cool prepackaged meals, snacks, sides, apps.etc.  All kinds of interesting desserts as well. Their prepackaged meals including pastas, salads could be packed as good lunches as well for work! make sure you check out the clearance section on each aisle..you're bound to score some good deals. i have enjoyed everything i have bought already and will def be going back to try new things. I highly recommend checking out this place and see whatcha think. think of it like a trader joe's.. not exactly the same but the same in the way they are not your typical grocery store.

This place is fabulous. I love everything about it. Atmosphere, service, quality and portions of food, drinks.. everything! I loved everything! Me and the bf got two apps and 3 entrees and they brought everything to us split already which earned xtra brownie points for sure!! Everything looked so good we had a hard time narrowing down so we just went all out and had no regrets.  Can't wait to go back!

Just fantastic... you need to go here.  Go for the ambiance (romantic, classy, upscale) Go for the food (variety, tasty big portions so you can share or be greedy and indulge) Go for the drinks (tequila, tequila, tequila)   Splurge, enjoy, love and repeat..

I adore Tempe Beach Park ! Stopped by for Oktoberfest over the weekend ( which was great by the way). I love being able to go and sit on the ledge overlooking the water. You kind of forget you're in the middle of the desert for a brief moment and then you stand up and see all the dirt all over you and reality kicks back in.  You can walk and hang out, paddle boat, bike trails etc.   Great place to visit!

The ability to build my own burger made me one happy girl as I tend to be very picky.  i was on a mission over the weekend to satisfy my unusual craving for a burger and decided to peep out Indulge. atmosphere is nice and laid back bar/restaurant environment. You get a menu that you mark up yourself and choose everything you want and they take your order off of that. They have appetizers and other signature menu items and the whole back side of the menu is left to create your own supreme yummy goodness. Everything from Kobe beef to feta cheese to avocados and fried eggs and about 20 million (ok not that many) sauces you can choose from to dip your deliciousness into. I could only eat about half so yes, portions are very generous. There beer selection is alright not as many craft selections like i would like to choose from but all right considering the restaurant. All in all i conquered my craving so Indulge is A-ok in my book

me and the bf were totally stoked to finally try out Posh. We did have reservations and we only waited a few minutes after we arrived for our table. Atmosphere is very nice. Windows all the way around the restaurant and a very sleek and clean feel to the whole place. We didn't sit at the bar but we had a nice little cozy table to ourselves but still you can still see the kitchen from pretty much every area of the restaurant considering it's in the middle.   The menu had everything from shrimp to NY strip to kangaroo. Nnooww I'm not totally into kangaroo but for those with adventurous taste buds will love the hell outta the menu checklist. So i removed everything i was not willing to try and any my meat temp preferences and then the kitchen will take it from there.  Everything we had was absolutely delicious!!! We had 8 plates in between the two of us and shared everything. We had everything from goat cheese salads to a fruit salad,,, shrimp and halibut appetizers. NY strip and a pork dish with delicious potatoes that resembled a pancake. Desserts were wonderful as well...    I KNOW I'm horrible I cannot remember every dish and what is actually consisted of, but believe me when i say everything was terrific. So adventurous or not so adventurous I'm pretty sure it's safe to say you will still have a dinner that is made just for you that you will love.   can't wait to go back!

I hate to give such a low rating but I can't lie when i say i really have experienced better. This place almost reminds me off knock off fast food type Greek food. They messed up our to go order(first strike), the staff did not even eat their own food( i asked the opinion of one of the employees and he stated i never have/will eat this food) whaaaa??? coulda at least lied, would have sounded better geezz..  the food was just mediocre in my opinion... just a good place for convenience late at night and yes the alcohol is probably a good idea since it probably does in fact help the food taste better.   meh :/

i was having a Fiesta theme get together at my house so i decided to stay away from Frys or Safeway and hit up pro Ranch- such a good decision! it was my first time here and this place is awesome. Huge store with just about everything you can imagine. A lot of specialty things you cannot get at Safeway and places like it but there are also a lot of items you can purchase here that you can get anywhere else as well. Great meat dept. I got 6lbs of carne asada- it was delicious.   This place is awesome. I got a lot of food for just over $100.00. You can have fun just walking around and checking out everything. You are bound to find something you probably have not tried before and feel intrigued to buy it and give it try. :)

I ordered about a week in advance for a special dozen cupcakes. They are super helpful and patient while trying to decide exactly what you want.  I ordered 6 of the coconut and 6 of the Reeces( you can only get peanut butter ones certain days) and they were both a hit! They decorated them with footballs and skateboards and everyone absolutely raved about the cupcakes! Def worth checking this place out and they are reasonably priced. This will be my go to spot for future special occasions!

SCORE!! A new fav to add into my rotation. I saw this place a fee times and the name always threw me off and didn't really know what to expect. Did some lovely yelp research, and decided to check it out. Love this place!! Tv's everywhere. Bar and both seating area. Its not a normal loud bar..there were families eating here with younger kids also to even older couples getting their grub on. Okay so the bbbeeeerrrrrrr!!!! Huge list of drafts that change constantly also . I had never had do many choices of IPA's!! You can create your own beer sampler. I made an,ipa sampler of four beers( ok I lie we made two samplers each ) we tried everything that sounded good. The menu is nice as well...everything from fried pickles to hummus to fish n chips... I actually had all three of these items and finger licking good.  Check this place out...you will dig it if you dig variety in your beer!

Love this place!! I'm a Chinese food whore i swear i could eat it every day! Anyway i am absolutely obsessed with their won ton soup.. This shit is SOO good.. Seriously. Best soup i have ever had. i want some right now just thinking about it. Everything we got was right on point as well.. Some chicken wings, lo mien, Mongolian beef  and my b/f is in love with their fried rice( have to admit it is pretty scrumptious)everything was delicious. Decent prices.. You can order for takeout, they deliver as well or you can eat in. inside is nothing special, but they are quick and the food is excellent.. Highly recommend!

So I have been to the location in Tucson and now experienced this one and I have to say that I did not have a WOW or YUMMM drooling moment at either. Don't get me wrong it's not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and I will pass next time.  There is just better Mexican cuisine out there,,,   Service was promt though!

Simply fantastic !!  We stopped in and ordered some food to go and the menu was somewhat overwhelming at first with all the choices.  Sat night is oxtail special night so my dear lova went crazy for that and got two orders and i tried the pulled pork. We ordered all three of the rice's as well since we couldn't make up our minds and we loveeee rice and beans :)  Everything was great..from the meat quality, to the different rice's to the different plantains.  We will Definitely be back

food is very good here along with a very friendly staff and clean environment. chicken is good and the waffles are awesome and dont even get me started about how delicious the mac and cheese is.. you have to try it when you go. You get koolaid in a mason jar and the food is a really good portion as well. we tired the banana pudding which is also very good, they had other homemade desserts like velvet cake. I def recommend trying this place, the menu is put together well and is very clever. Cool names for all the entrees, you wont regret giving lolos a try...and good thing about food like this its good for breakfast, lunch or dinner!

Why Total Wine is better than Bevmo :  1) Bevmo does not like you to get joy from being able to pick from rows and rows of single beers so you can build your own special pack 2) organization  3) About every beer you can buy in a 6 pack you can find on the "single" shelves as well. Wait did i already state this?  I love me a good beer tasting and Total Wine lets me go bananas with my choices.  Love you TW&M !

this is review is on the liquor store half- five stars just due to the fact that you can create your own six pack or twelve back or whatever pack it takes you to get the buzz you are after.  I love browsing and trying new beers...you can come back multiple times and never repeat the same thing if you want... I love Tops.  bar connected as well with rotating draft selections- find something you love and you can buy it in the liquor store- pure f*cking genius.

Finally was able to check out the actual bar area of this wonderful establishment! We had three beer samplers between the two of us because we could not make up our minds what we wanted to drink. They are super helpful here and they know their shit when it comes to beer, Chill low key vibe inside. Strictly beer, no food but people were bringing in their own stuff to eat so you can always bring your own grub if you wish. Tap rotates frequently; even changed a few while we were there so you will always be able to try out something new!

I was impressed with their menu and drink selection. 3 different sized cups, all kinds of flavors. They also have these "bowls" which look so enticing! Consists of fruit, granola, acai, honey etc. they have a few different  kinds but they look so good for being healthy for ypu :). Honestly, i think they have maybe more to offer than Jamba does. I had the Pina-cool-ada, and i feel in love with it. They break down the calories of each drink depending which size cup you get also. I'm all about information at my fingertips and they had everything I needed/wanted to know laid out nicely.  You get a free boost as well.. fat burner, energy etc. They also serve different kinds of pretzels as well.   It was my first visit here so forgive me because i know i am leaving some things off...but this goes to show you the menu is extensive cause I damn sure cannot remember all of it.  Next time you're in the mood to get your juice on.. Check out Juice it up... see if it titillates your senses as it did mine. :0

nothing like your normal brewery/bar and that is why i like it so much!  Inside it has a very comfortable homey vibe to it. I really dig the atmosphere here, its almost like hanging out in a friends big living room. You can watch one of the t.v's, play cards or a board game, even bring your own food in  if you want and just chill out and enjoy some good beers. The people who work here and really laid back, this is just an all around nice place to relax after a long day. They do not serve food but they do have a food truck parked right outside each day they are open (wed-sat). each day it is a different company providing the food and they work in collaboration with the sleepy dog. Also have deals if you buy food get a beer for a buck or something like that. They have menus inside for what is served outside.   Yes everything is dog themed and they are creative in the way they implement it. The beer sampler( GET IT, its awesome) comes served in a dish that is bone shaped..and the names of the beers are dog related etc.   its just a no pressure come as you are place and who doesn't like a place like that??  oh yeah and the bathrooms are super cool...all metal. have a couple beers and go in one. its like you walked into a walk in refrigerator that's not cold(if that makes any sense) anyway i like em'

I have been eyeing Modern Steak for a few years and finally made time to actually check it out. It is very sleek and nice inside and service was really good. They are also having a summer special pre-fix menu right now for $30- which I did glance over but i went for the traditional menu to check everything out since it was my first time. They have a lot of choices and a lot of unique dishes. We tried the artichoke app and popcorn shrimp to start and both were delicious. The artichoke was def my favorite of the two. It took me forever and a day to decide but ended up going with the salmon which was very good but now i have to go back for the spinach fettuccini which is what originally got my attention. Lova' got a humungo steak and said it was one of the best one's he has had in the Scottsdale area.  So, overall we both left full and happy and me slightly tipsy from their delicious "Jalisco" specialty drink they have..su-p-e-r-b drink combo !  Good date night spot :)

Produce is very fresh! large selection of fruits as well. Good sake selection :)  check it out..very cool place..love that we have a place like this. I plan on being here so much i am going to learn how to speak Chinese or Vietnamese just by walking around. :)

Dang, I hate writing low star ratings but I need to get my issues out in the open.  Also, let me just say the food was good and I was really looking forward to finally checking out Lobbys, my low rating is based really on the service we got.   First off, we were the only two people in the whole joint when we ordered so it's not like they were busy and being rushed to finish our orders and that's why they got messed up. Everything about our entire order was jacked up and when I'm starving and I get home to find out, yes I become a little agitated. (I know I SHOULD have checked my burger but really, unwrap everything and check it? I like to give the benefit of the doubt; I mean it is their job)  Everything I didn't want on my burger came on my burger and the things i asked for on the side came all on the burger as well. Same EXACT thing with my boyfriend's burger. The chef was standing right next to the register as well and could hear our order and still everything was wrong and they also forgot to give an order of fries as well.   Super disappointed that I get something I paid for exactly opposite from how I ordered it. Not just one order but both. C'mon.  Would take my $21 back if I could

So I gave Lobbys another shot (everyone deserves a 2nd chance, well almost everyone) and I'm glad I did because everything was MUCH better this time around. Our food was made correctly and everything was very tasty. My boyfriend was much more pleased as well and said he can definitely throw Lobbys now into his list of places to go when he is craving a good burger. Everything is really fresh here and you can taste it. Staff is super nice too, which is always a plus.  Thanks Lobbys for making my second dining experience so much better and totally make me forget about our first encounter :)

Just as wonderful as its other location... not sure why its called #2, it is pretty much identical to the other Totties... but either way i can get over the name dilemma because i love me some Totties! anything you get is good, you really cannot go wrong. the tangerine chicken is out of this world btw !

Thai Basil is just delicious! I love Thai food but i try not t drag the bf along too much since he has not yet found a Thai place that has a dish he really loves but that changes since bringing him here ! WHOOP WHOOP!   Really good and quick service for either eating in or taking to go ( we have done both). He is in love right now with their chow mein and i as always am a big fan of Pad Thai.  their pad Thai is not as spicy as other places i have been which is ok considering i can spice it up myself if necessary. only downfall for me is i am not a fan t all of their sweet and sour pork which is a big deal for me, since next to Pad Thai that is definitely a second.    Their chicken sa tay and spring rolls are really good as well!  Cheap!

Love the simplicity of the food and how its transformed into something so delicious!  Sometimes bean/cheese on some fry bread is all a girl needs to get through the day! Oh, and their hot sauce is bomb!  Great prices and way better than any any drive thru fast good joint.   P.s They are closing this location soon and moving out to Phoenix! Get it close to home while you can! You know you love some powered sugar fry bread...dont lie to yourself!

This place is great! Huge menu and they are very accommodating so you can switch things up without a problem! We tried the sampler and everything was delic! I created my own vegetable and rice plate and added some eggplant. They have such a wide variety in ingredients here you are bound to find something you will love. Lover boy enjoyed his curry. When we pulled up I was not expecting this place to have a bar BUT they did AND I was like duh, totally thankful (yes I just pulled out my white valley girl).  I will like totally be back to eat here again, like totally!

YAY! I love when I get to write a good positive update on a place! My second trip to Mabels on Main was perfect! We arrived early enough to grab a booth and stayed until the late night crowd showed up so we got to feel the complete vibe of this place and I have to say I loved it ! Service was great and we enjoyed everything we ordered as well. We shared the cheese platter, chicken lollipops and also the mac n cheese which was heaven!  So glad I did not write Mabels off my list and gave it another go around cause this is a very cool upscale lounge and can't wait to take some out of town visitors here during a night out!  p.s their VIP room is pretty legit and affordable.. nice secluded room behind a secret wall :)

i love me some pita jungle!! love that there is also a location downtown by my place of lovely employment :)  you will find everything you would at all the other locations, the jalapeno hummus is awesome !  just a tip *** if you are ordering and you only have an hr for lunch i HIGHLY suggest calling in and ordering for pick up. this location being downtown is always hectic!  p.s met the Mayor of Phoenix here on a lunch time run.. good to know he enjoys a good plate of hummus ;)

I had  a rental car here for about two wks. I started with only four days and each time I needed to extend they made the process very easy. You do not have to pay until you actually return the car so they just have a sorta open tab for you until you are done needing the car. Good choices in cars and yes even though renting a car is extremely expensive(especially over a long period of time) the overall amount was not too extreme. I would definitely use Thrifty again. Oh and you can rent if you are under 25, there is just an extra $10 charge for being under 25.

This is the perfect spot for someone looking just to be able to get your daily workout in without being in a crowded standard gym. they have all the basics you need.. in my book has everything i need, nothing more nothing less. Small, not crowded, 24/7 access even on holidays. only downside is there  are no showers, so just make sure you give yourself time to get home and shower if you need to be somewhere after your workout. ( would have gave 5 stars if had showers)Also which is nice is you can watch what you want on one of the t.v's, compared to other gyms where your forced to watch what they put on.  Also you have the option to pay month to month which is AWESOME since a contract with a gym is like  a marriage, so you def do not feel trapped with this place.  Cant beat low prices. glad i found this place and glad its a low key kind of place since workout time for me is exactly that and not social hour.YAY for snap fitness!

YAY for not getting ripped off.  so my car just decided not to start one morning... after i got a jump i drove it straight to auto zone to get a new battery. The man working check my battery first and let me know i should probably hold off on buying sd my battery was reading good, volts good etc( don't really understand all the car gibberish, but it sounded good)  so i saved myself money and the guys said sometimes things happen..light left on to drain the battery etc...  i always appreciate honesty! he could have not checked at all and made me fork out money for something i really didn't need...thanks AutoZone man!

i was impressed with the White House! this place in my opinion is different from other Scottsdale's clubs...different in a good way. The group of people is a nice mixed variety and the inside atmosphere is just more on the chill side, then all hype and crazy. The decor is nice and they even have nice big couches out back if you are a smoker. The vip/couch areas are nice and there are TV's all over playing music videos. Bartenders are pretty quick and attentive does not take too long to get a drink either. Music selection is pretty good..good mix of hip hop/pop.   This will be my new spot for when i do want a night out but not with all the young just turned 21 out to get wild/drunk/annoying crowd...  i digg the White House.

First year living in phoenix and we heard about this Festival ( i guess it is a yearly thing) and we went to go check it out. We had so much fun. we went during the night hours so i cannot tell you about how the daytime is. Food, beer, rides, games, music, crap to buy, people to watch, they also had a seal show and some flaming fire show as well even rode a mechanical bull for my first time ( and yes i rode it like a champ for my 1st time :0 ). All kinds of food to choose from and depending if you know how to let your inner kid out this place can def be fun for people of all age groups! We had a blast ,glad we went.

This place is awesome..we happened to spot it driving around and decided to stop in..we were def like two kids in a candy store. Easily got over two pounds of just crap and spent about 20 bucks. this place has anything you could think of, things you forgot about over the years and things you didnt even know existed. If you take your young ones in here, be prepared for them to go absolutely nutso! this place is better than Halloween..you can fill your bag with all your favorite sugar and pay for your own cavities! def a must stop if you ever pass by this place. So fun!

Nice outdoor patio but it was cold when we went so we opted for a nice cozy seat inside. Nice menu and healthy selections ..+ and + ! Hummus, ;lettuce wraps, shrimp, veggies, cheese... we ordered so much food between two ppl even the waiter asked when the last time we ate was...lol we had the munchies what can i say :)  Quick service and the bill didn't hurt too much either.... check it out for apps and drinks!!

This whole area where The Nest is located is just awesome. Its themed as a creative old cowboy ghost kinda town... ( that's Jessica lingo so if you don't get it basically im just saying its very cool). muawhahaha i HEART haunted houses and just anything scary in general. I believe it was $25 a person. you could pay VIP as well to get thru the line quicker if you wish. there was a stop on the long walk to the actual Nest. On this walk i encountered a few wonderful/interesting things. 1) margarita shack... muy bueno! 2) this attraction called The Thing. We paid a dolla to see it...i still am pondering to this day if it was real or not, but i hope my dolla gets put to good use.3) piglets! i know totally not part of the whole being scared thing i was going for but hey, im a girl who is a sucker for anything small and cute.   The Nest is a great haunted house. VERY ORGANIZED and put together very well. You can tell this attraction is something they take seriously and i can appreciate it. Totally absolutely positively recommend!

I dodged this place a few times due to the lack of reviews and low stars...but i somehow ended up here one night and left with a very happy and full tummy. The atmosphere here is very nice and i guess can be considered on the romantic side. From the get go I loved my server, he was attentive and was funny as well which is a plus in my book!  They have steaks, salads, seafood etc. We had some breaded eggplant to start and it was very good. You also get bread and oil/vinegar to start with as well. Now the entrees... the lover had the special fish that night and i had the king crab. THE CRAB!! came with the top of the shell all sliced off for you so no cracking, messiness!! i absolutely loved this concept. I was still able to be lady like and eat it with my fork. this is my new go to spot when I'm in the mood for crab. actually get to enjoy it instead of it feeling like a job by getting the dang meat out. also they keep the butter warm over a candle( it's the simple things in life that make me a happy girl).  I'm not a steak girl so I can't say the steak here is good but I will vouch and say that every plate that passed us looked amazing!

I'm aware we all pretty much know what jamba jucie is all about so my review is more about their new( to me at least) and delicious fresh squeezed juice options. IM OBSESSED. yes, on the pricy side compared to other juice bars but very good drinks overall. I have tried several and they are all great.  From carrot cayenne to ginger apple aid.. etc they are super refreshing, filling and most of all tasty!

Shame on me for taking so long to write this review, do you forgive me??  I am at this dang place at least twice a week ( a little OCD) but I am always in and out. I love this place. FREE VACUUMS ! I cannot stand when my car is dirty and it's so nice to be able to pull in and get Gina vacuumed out and then back to my day in no time flat. The selection in washes are all reasonable and I think at $6+ you get a free towel and air freshener. They also have vending machines with all kinds of goodies for $1 and I always keep back up air fresheners in my car. I love the smell. I'm a free vacuum and cheap air freshener addict.  Convenient + cheap + clean car = cheerful me  Summertime is around the corner so you need your car to be pretty- go here!

Stopped into Tanzy on a last minute decision and turned out to be a GREAT choice ! Food was excellent. The brussel sprouts app was friggin fantastic- seriously they were wonderful. I had the risotto which is was so good it inspired me to master my own risotto recipe at home (which i did, if you are wondering). Lova' had the pork and he didn't have any complaints. The beer selection was not the best but i did try a cucumber-limon martini and supa dupa refreshing!

Bought a new whip a month ago and the windows were just not dark enough for me. I cant stand people peeking at me to see what I'm doing at stop lights or in traffic. Booked a Sat appt and they had me out of there in just over an hour. I hung out while they did the tint and they let me use their WIFI so i could get some hw done. Very nice guys and the tint job is perfect. i waited until today to write my review since i gave the tint two days to sit and was able to roll my windows down for the first time today and everything is perfect. I got limo black on all the windows and a shade lighter on my driver and passenger. I love it.  they do a really good job here..i highly recommend !. CHECK IN on Yelp for $20 off !!

I am not one to just give 5 stars to anyone but this place absolutely, positively deserves it! it was my first time visiting a Thai massage establishment and I am totally hooked after just one visit. Once you go into the back you really feel like you are on a mini vacation somewhere. So peaceful, quiet and relaxing. The whole experience was much more than i was expecting. The boyfriend and myself stopped in for some Thai foot massages and we left completely relaxed, happy and wanting to turn right back around for another session. Like I said, the experience was SO much more than what I was expecting..it was fantastic. I will be back Soon , for their Thai stretching/massage they offer.   Totally affordable and totally awesome.  Your feet do a lot for you EVERDAY... show them how much you appreciate all their hard work :)

SO GLAD I CAN GET PHO ON MY LUNCH NOW!!! YAY Rice Paper! They do get busy around lunch time but I have never had a problem with my pick-up orders not being ready when they said they would. I have had the Pho without meat though so I can't comment on that but the Pho in general is fantastic and they add in extra noodles and veggies if you skip the meat. your common pho prices that you see around this area so I can't really bitch about the price. Cute but small inside and yes like others have said.. parking sucks baallzzzzz.  Other than that definitely  a great place for to grab so Pho.

well done Asia, you won me over! Recently i have been on a Chinese, Korean, Japanese etc kick and this place has a menu that is pretty well rounded( hence why it is called Asia, has a little bit of everything) i really liked the diversity of the menu.  your bound to find something that will feed your hunger. if your not feelin Chinese you can go Japanese..etc. Appetizers were really good, and we both really liked our main dishes as well...even had the leftovers for lunch today.   Only one waitress last night..prob on fri and sats have more service..but she was a champ, did really well for handling everyone solo.   Food came out quickly as well too.  two apps, two entrees and 4 rounds of Sake for $50 can't beat that!  side note: the bar area is pretty cool it looks over the kitchen which is in the middle of the restaurant..also had a little patio area as well.   i will be back.

I had a good time for my first experience at Stand Up Live. Like most comedy clubs in the area you have to be okay with the possibility of rubbing elbows with someone else.. space is always limited and packed full but other than that I have no complaints. They put 6 of us at a high top.. it was small but we made due..we paid for bottle service and the waiter took great care of us at our table throughout the show. Snacks..drinks etc.   You really cannot have a good spot here... every seat is a pretty decent seat. Ill be back!

We have been here a few times now and really have a good time every time. Me and the bf took up skate boarding and we have tried a few skate parks out but this is by far our favorite! Everyone is really nice here and its nice because you have all age groups skating and everyone is always offering tips to try to help you out. This is a good place if you are just starting out or even if you are advanced. It's an actual skateboard school so you can take classes or skate during their free skate hours for 10-15 for about three hours. Huge indoor skate park which is great all year around :)  Very cool place !

Great lunch experience! I went around 1 so I might have missed the noon lunch rush but our service was super prompt and quick. I was even able to drag someone along and got to pop their Thai cherry (i love getting people out of their normal food box and try something new) and they loved their meal as well. I tried the pad thai and got it pretty spicy and it was delicious. Their spring rolls are mighty tasty as well. For lunch portions they give you a lot of food but I'm not one to complain about leftovers :)  **check in on Yelp to get the 10% discount**

So i am sort of a snob when it comes to pizza. I'm guilty of judging places because I am not a fan of pizza Hut and other like places but I recently got some coupons in the mail for Papa Murphy's and decided what the heck, I will give it a shot. I called in before I left work and they were ready for pick up when I got over there. i got a specialty stuffed one for my boo and got myself a veggie thin crust and even got some free cookie dough!! The gentleman that helped me on the phone and when i went it was very helpful and make my first experience just delightful. It was a nice change just to get home and throw something in the oven and have dinner be done. The pizzas came out better than I expected and my boyfriend even said the next morning that his pizza was really good and would def order from Papa M's again. That comment coming from him says a lot, since he is a bigger pizza snob then I am!  Super convenient, super tasty, super affordable.  SCORE X3 !

it is normally not like me to give a good rating on anything that is associated with the DMV but this is definitely an exception. They have a new tool that you can few current wait times at any emission location which makes going and scheduling time to do so, SO much easier.  I was able to run on my lunch break and i was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes. The current wait time when i left my job was 2 minutes and that was how long i waited to get my testing done.  YAY for something done correctly and in a organized manner with the DMV.

Was this menu invented for me? No, but i like to think YES! All organic! Super extensive menu for the picky non meat eating person. I ordered the vegetarian tamales. Artichoke and spinach and a jalapeno hummus. They were delicious. They also had a black bean/corn one which they were out of but did sound delicious! I also got veggie rice dish with kung pao sauce, beat salad and my cutie got the beef burger..which is was super pleased with.   I will absolutely be a regular here and I'm looking forward to trying some other dishes that caught my eye. My only complaint was we made our order to go and didn't realize until we got home they forgot to pack our side hummus/chips..but I called and they were more than happy to let me come by again when I can and get that order picked up .    Ill be back!

This place turned out to be a lovely surprise. After 10pm i believe it turns a 21 and over only restaurant which is kind of nice. We stopped in during a weekday and there was good music and the lights were dimmed and people were just hanging out eating and drinking and having a good time. The menu is different during the later hours but still a lot of very good choices. They have a white cheddar burger and it was probably one of the best I have ever had. It was just delicious ( I had one again a few days later..shhhhhh, our secret) and also tried their chipotle mac and cheese and it was fattening and yummy as could be. they have a pretty decent beer selection although not as crafty as some other places like Hungry Monk or Topps but still a good craft selection. Its huge inside and outside and more than enough room and space to get a good table or seat at the bar. Highly suggest checking it out, very good addition to Tempe.  side note: they let me add a fried egg to my burger- which immediately chalked up their awesomeness- yes awesomeness.

I feel in love last night. Yes, the wine could have had some impact on my emotions but nonetheless this place is nothing short of awesome. Surprised my lover boy and took him on a date to this very romantic and sophisticated establishment and from the big comfy couches and chairs, to the bruschetta and cheese tasting washed down by delicious wine undoubtedly served up a very good time. After eating, we enjoyed our drinks outside sitting on the fire pit listening to music and canoodling like we were teenagers... sigh.... I could go on but you're not here to read about my mushy moments now are you? No, you're not but you now have read about a place that you MUST go check out... just go.. shhhhh you don't need to say anything just get up and go....and have a wineederfuulll time.

Had my first airbrush experience with Laura and it was a great one. I decided to get some extra color before I headed out to Cali for my bestfriends wedding and i was super happy with my color. Not orange at all. I went a very deep tan and it was just what i wanted. It is an all day inconvenience though so be prepared to do this on an a day that you don't have any other major plans.. like cleaning, showering etc. Even be careful when it comes to eating and drinking. I was eating grapes and a drop of juice dripped down on my chest before I dried..and well yeah, I was left with a circle drop of light skin lol surrounded by all the tan. Oh well.. ya live ya learn!  i will be back and highly recommend the Bronze Bar. Laura made me feel totally comfortable being butt nekkid...nothing weird at all. Totally professional!

Can't believe I have slacked on this review for so long...shame on me!  This place is great. I've been here several times. Sometimes for just a fresh squeezed juice or for a wrap & sometimes for both. I always leave super happy with whatever I purchase. I work downtown so I call or order my items on line first and go walk and pick it up. It's always ready when they say it will be.   Veggies, hummus, salads, wraps, pizzas.. get creative..everything is delicious! The energizer fresh squeezed juice is my fav as well.

Finally somewhere in my neighborhood that has good craft beer and atmosphere!! Inside looks completely different from the outside. Its large but still welcoming inside. Pool tables, tv's all over the place, booth seating and of course bar seating.  Happy hour every day until 7pm !! I tried the hummus and devoured the whole thing along with my Guinness.  Good prices and good service.  You will see me here again, it's a given.  They have beer flights.

I really, really love Distrito. I love food and this place pushes out excellent food. Me and my boo thang have been here twice and he would probably go back almost daily if he could for the fried crab claws. You need to get them, I'm drawing a blank on the name that is on the menu..but track them down and order them. We get an order each even though they are for sharing..delicious. The guac is really good as well ( free with yelp check in). Service is really on point at Distrito. you get the whole Iron Chef feel thanks to this being Chef Jose Garces spot. The cook had brought out complimentary little muffins before dinner, and each dish was brought out and explained ( i love that, makes me feel important for some reason) i like my food being explained to me. It's like verbal food porn.   Ambiance, design, mood & food is all just incredibly sexy here. Good job.  See you Soon Distrito.

This place is totally cute inside and i guess i expected the food to be just as good as the place looked but ended up being super disappointed.   Bf just the grilled cheese that came with bacon and he was not that impressed. It was more like an overload on cheese and tasting like a goopy quesadilla on soggy bread and my sandwich was all wrong when i got it. I was on a lunch hour and got frustrated and didn't have time to wait so ended up getting my money back for my sandwich.   wompwompwomp was hoping this would be a new little go to sandwich spot.

Rude as hell!!!!!!! Im sorry but no matter what time of day im calling for a pizza i deserve the same customer service that everyone else gets. So rude.. i decided not to place an order in fear that they would probably do something foul to my pizza.  You all messed up treating me like crap...lost a lot of  business. Straight disappointment.  Had to physically call to even find out about their menu since their website didnt even provide "menu" information.  Horrible...just horrible experience. .i could go on..but im done with this establishment #byefelicia

i was a little disappointed considering the good reviews. They do deliver and they are very prompt and they did get our order completely right. The food was just not as good as i was expecting. We got some spring rolls, sesame chicken, pork fried rice and vegetable lo mien. Everything was just o.k. The fried rice was definitely my least favorite. I eat a lot of Chinese, Asian and Thai and this just did not do a thing for my taste buds.   They are fairly priced and for home delivery i cannot be that upset i just expected more.  Meh, it was edible.

ATL is easily on its way towards a Best of Phoenix issue....seriously good wings.  I have tried lots of different wings from around the city thanks to my bf who is always on the hunt for the best wings. Atl easily just jumped to the top of our go to list. We went with Seasoned, Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan. A-H-H-Mazzzing. Fried hard and crisp and seasoned perfectly. No sauce even required. The quality of the chicken is great and you can taste it also there is nothing puny about these wings either.  Kool-Aid on tap and lots of other menu options like fish, chicken fingers, okra, mac n cheese, honey biscuits with honey and powdered sugar etc..  GO here and fall in love, you wont regret it.

I'm pretty much here every morning...even jumped a few curbs and did a few illegal things to get in the drive thru line. Yes, i have a green tea addiction..GUILTY.  Always really quick here both in the drive thru and if you get out and walk up to the window you get fast service as well.  TIP: if you need ur caffeine in the morning and you are usually in a rush you might want to give yourself 10 extra minutes and get here no later than 7:05am- after that traffic and feigns get crazy!   trust me i know.

Ok...so if you are like me i take my nails seriously (why get them done if they look crappy, right?) They are super nice here and they really go the xtra mile to make you happy and do their best tp give you what you ask for. They do not overprice either. i am totally happy i gave this place a shot and is my new go to for my nail art :)   My only complaint is they dont have a lot of nail polish options that i am used to at other places but with that being my only issue i can totally deal with it and always bring my own if i want something specific.

just a little update...  i said before they do not have a super dooper extensive wall of colors like some places have BUT they do have pretty much any color you could want and when it goes to doing any nail art they really have every color in a crayon box that you could think of to deck out your nails.   *Everyone needs a little color in their life*

This place is awesome. We drove by and saw this place and the fact that it is called World of beer was enough for us to go and check it out and i am sooo glad we did. First off, i absolutely love how big and open the windows are here. Great to sit and be able to take in the nightlife going on outside as well as what's going on inside. Lots of TV's, so its a good spot to catch a game too.   The beer menu is pretty large and im sure you will come across an old favorite and will find something new to love if you are in the mood to try some new brews. We had a few black and tans, few beer shots ( delicious). Our waitress was awesome, she was rlly attentive given how busy she was she was just so happy and i love getting service like that. Nothing worse then someone with a tear in their eye and an evil sad look on their face while serving you a beer that is supposed to make you smile.   This place would be off the chain if they served small plates to go with the beer but they do have a list of nearby places that you can order from and will deliver to you on the spot...which is a nice touch.   Ill be back for suresies.

Sexy, cool, trendy, artsy but upscale vibe as you walk thru the doors. Delicious, creative, mouth watering decisions as you scan the menu. Beer, wine, bubbles and mixed drinks while you wait for your first plate in anticipation. Relaxing cool music , design and architecture to check out while you chill out. Attentive servers, hot scrumptious food and full satisfied stomachs. Happy full and slightly tipsy couple.  Returning is a for sure.  LoVe

I LOVE TACOS! Safe to say i could probably have tacos just about every day and be a very happy woman! It was hot as hell for being mid October but still was able to enjoy myself. Two bucks a taco and we all had a decent amount. Good karma happened to follow us that day, a guy was leaving and handed us about 20 xtra tickets that he was not going to use. SCORE! So we were able to grub and drink even more than we intended. Overall I think that event was a success. I didn't have any trouble getting drinks as other people mentioned, maybe it was the time of day I showed up and it was less busy.

Good as it gets for my first Bikram experience. I'm an total gym rat but was in the mood to try a little something different so i gave this shot. it was everything i expected it to be and i left feeling awesome. The Instructor was great and a nice facility with a nice area for changing and lockers etc. they do provide mats if you do not have one first time around.   I really enjoy more intense paid workouts but this is something i will look into doing whenever i feel like i need to slow things down for awhile and get my muscles relaxed and stretched out. I walked away with some good tips and can see myself back sometime in the near future.

I used to hit this spot for my pho cravings since its super convienent to mi casa. It has now been taken over and things have changed but not for the better. i went for the Pad Thai since it is usually a good test for me to determine if i will be back again. It was ok...nothing that knocked me off my feet which of course saddened my Thai loving heart.  Pho Ao Sen, I'm not sure what happened but i Miss you and wish you didn't leave.

This place turned out to be a VERY nice surprise. It is definitely similar to Chipotle but the quality of food here is much better in my opinion. Im only comparing it to Chipotle due to the similarites as making your order and choosing what you would like. Fresh cooked veggies, variety in meat and hummus. You also get rice and toppings as well.   Easy quick dinner to pick up and take home and its very filling...and given that you pretty much cannot get anything that's unhealthy here you dont feel as guilty after you stuff your face and devour the whole bowl :)

BOMB, BOMB, BOMB!! Loved Barrelhouse!  If you time it right and you can stop by for happy hour...do it! They have a lot of small dishes and you can pretty much get a whole dang menu sample and not make your debit card cry. Little artichoke bites from Heaven, savory short rib etc etc Nice craft beer list, and the food was creative, fun and just downright delicious.  Nice dark, sexy lil' vibe goin' inside those deceiving exterior walls... yum!

I came across Joyride about a month ago and had it bookmarked with intentions to try very,very soon. Then i saw it in the New Time, "Best of 2013" and made it mandatory to get out here pronto! I was sucked in light a moth to a light as soon as we sat down. The atmosphere is so inviting and comfortable..like hanging out in a friends cool backyard.  Started off with a cup or tortilla soup and Cheese y mas ( warm melted cheesy goodness), both of which were spot on.  Me and my lover boy shared the fried fish taco & braised beef taco and he went all in for The Beast burrito and i went for the cochinita pibil torta. Let me tell you something, Im not usually a totra kinda girl but I switched it up yesterday & Im glad i did because the damn torta rocked my taste buds. We both had leftovers but devoured the rest as a late night snack.   Oh yeah, please do try the daily freshly made aguas frescas.  Recommendation: Cucumber Mint spiked with tequila. ( Hey, i felt somewhat healthy while drinking it)

So, I had The Vig bookmarked for almost 2 years and I was very upset with myself after my 1st time here that it took me so long to get my booty in this establishment!! I loved it. I went total gluttony overboard and I have ZERO regrets. Edamame was fantastic. Their cheesy tator tots that tasted like God hand rolled them himself were a flavor party in my mouth with every delicious savory both (slight drooling happening), we had the whitefish special and killed that in about 3.5 minutes. My boo had the short rib tacos as well...he murdered those as well...no remaining meat was found anywhere. We also had shrimp pad Thai and the mac& cheese. Yes , this was ALL consumed among two ppl. We finished  everything besides the two pastas which we took home and thoroughly enjoyed the next day. Craft beers, and cocktail drinks were happily consumed as well.  The food is of really good quality here. I left feeling full but not the run down I need a nap bcus I cant move full. I was rlly happy with this restaurant and I will be back in the near future...the menu does change as well!!  p.s great service!

Great new establishment in downtown Phoenix area. Asian cuisine with a modern twist,  Trendy decor inside and nice patio as well. We grab two seats up at the kitchen bar eating area and were able to watch them cooking etc. The beat salad was ahhh-mazz-inngg ! I wanted to order a second one but I contained myself. I also had some shrimp with my salad and I thoroughly enjoyed both of them. We ordered a bottle of sake as well and finished the whole damn thing before we even finished eating :)  Service was on point, food was exactly what i expected when i ordered it. Decent affordable prices as well.  Try it out!

Well damn! I feel guilty that i have not written a review yet! I have been here MULTIPLE times and each time i leave full and satisfied. This place is first come first serve and does get crazy packed, so be prepared to wait. I love the chill laid back atmosphere. I always get a nice cold beer while I'm waiting for a table. Inside and outdoor eating. Everything is good here from what i hear but i can only vouch for the crab, shrimp and hushpuppies! Its what we get every time. My absolute fav is getting 1lb of the king crab spicy level of 3 and trifecta sauce! DELICIOUS!! and hot! But delicious! it can be a bit of an expensive dinner even just for two people...but it is really worth the splurge if you want to get your cracking crab on!  I love it here so don't be surprised if ya see me!

Great place. As with most of the juice bars around the valley drinks are kinda on the pricey side but what you are getting is definitely a healthy FRESH drink. Cannot vouch for food but menu is totally vegan and vegetarian friendly. Very cute place!!

loved my experience here. You can tell right away that he just wants his customers to leave happy..and i love that shit!    make and create your own from the extensive list of flavors or try one of the house made juice concoctions!  We left with four bottles of delicious creations.. i will def be back!  keep up the great flavors and great customer experience!
