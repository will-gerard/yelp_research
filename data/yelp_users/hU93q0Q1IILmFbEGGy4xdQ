I found Advanced while surfing checkin offers. They have a coupon for a discounted oil change, so I gave them a shot. The customer service is great, I walked in the door and was greeted by a very pleasant service writer. I showed the yelp offer, and they took the keys. Everything was going smooth so far...   They came back with a repair order for nearly 800; shocks, battery, 60k service, etc. I expected a few maintenance issues, but this caught me off guard. The friendly writer turned consultative and told me my battery must be replaced ASAP, I declined and went on my way. I decided to pit stop autozone and grab an airfilter when I noticed a "free battery test" sign in the window. I got it checked out, and their test said my battery was 100% & manufactured 5/10.   Trust your instincts during the up-sell.  +2 stars for customer service & a checkin offer. -3 for the latter.

Real.Street.Tacos: cilantro, onions, lime & hot sauce. Reminds me of taco joints in Chicago. Save the sour cream & cheese for taco-smell.  The downside is the place is usually packed for the lunch rush so go a little early/later. I'd love to see Los make a food truck!

I love the coffee shop! It's a great place to relax on the patio & have brunch. The san diegan & TJ omelettes are soo good!

After moving here from Chicago it was hard to find a good cleaner in the valley. Fresh cleaners is nothing short of what I expect from a cleaner; a great press, collar stands, no more than 2 garments to a bag, and prompt service. The owner LuCia is fantastic and can work with tough deadlines... oh yeah it's green too!

Wow, the other reviews slammed this place pretty hard! I don't have any complaints... It's a carwash. They cleaned my car just as advertised on the building :)  I haven't had the solicitations for glass chips, they do offer "upgrades" for details and such. No harm in turning them down if you don't want the extras.   Maybe they've gone through turnover and its worth another shot?

I have never walked out of a restaurant prior to ordering, but there's a first time for everything.    It must been a busy night, because the service was painfully slow. We initially walked in & made our way to a table. It was difficult to navigate around with the oddly placed couch area. We sat down at a table towards the back of the room, and couldn't help but notice a foul smell... low and behold we were near the bathrooms! So, we saw another table leave and we quickly swarmed in on a new location by the bar.   After being ignored for nearly 10 minutes, menus were finally dropped and the server raved about how some Arizona winery just changed the world. I wasn't impressed, I really wanted to order... something! To my disarray she left the table and went back to the bar, without taking our drink order?!?  Oh well, on to other bookmarks.

BOBA TEA! That's all I visit this place for. I can't get enough of the milk teas & smoothies with boba!

I freaking love frozen yogurt! I'm pretty sure I have a problem with this place... I never know which one to pick. It's stressful. Luckily they have large bowls so I can mix flavors together!
