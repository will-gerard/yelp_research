Good. Came very fast even for a bike delivery. We used grub hub to order the food and when they didnt have soup they got my number from the site and called to ask what we wanted instead. Delivery girl was sweet and adorable! Made sure the order was correct!

We came in at 4:15 right when they opened. Got immediately seated our server Abigail? Or Audrey? Tossed the napkin roll ups on our plate.  Asked if we wanted bread we said yes then took our drink order. Cause you know free bread. Yum. Asked if we wanted any starters we ordered the Fried Pickles. Waited around 10 minutes for the pickles. When they came out she said. Do you still want bread. We already said yes. So we said Yes please. Got our bread and took our order. My mother got there Burger, my grandma got the 9.99 special with the 8oz steak, and i Got the 9.99 texas combo with the 8oz and the shrimp. For the sides i got the salad and the steak fries. My grandma got the baked potato and the side of chili I got my salad before the food came out. It was pretty dry and the croutons were burnt. The rest of the food came out and the server forgot the side of chili. So we asked for her to get it. By the time she brought it out we were already half way done. As we are STILL USING OUR FORK and knifes. She said "Do you guys want boxes" we said no thanks, as we are still eating. We take a break as were talking. She comes up and grabs my grandmas plate. She looks at us and says Are you done? We said yes since she basically grabbed everything set up to be taken away. This is 30minutes into our meal. She came back with the check and didnt even offer if we wanted anything else. Didn't ask for refills once. We still tipped 20% and left without causing issues. As were leaving my Grandma tells us that her food was cold. If we would have known that inside we would have complained.  Hopefully Abigail or whatever is having a better day now.

Great food, great atmosphere, great people, amazing location. Simple and sweet . Walked in and was greated by hostess , was very friendly and told us it would be 20 minutes got our number and would send the text when the table is ready. Luckily its right next to some  shops so we shopped around a bit and next thing we know its been 20 minute's. Waitress was lovely and promptly got our drinks and food put in. I ordered the Benny Duo, half of the Bella Bella Benny and the chile Benny! Friend got The Snooze Classic. The food was great! Fresh yummy and simple and classic flavors mixed with new and exotic hints and tastes as well!. Reasonable price as well, will definitely go again.
