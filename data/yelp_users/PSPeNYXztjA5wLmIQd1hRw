Strange Business Practices... I took in some of my things to be sold to kid to kid and left surprised.    I had 7 items including many big ticket items.  I purchased these things for well over $400 new and they were in great shape.  They offered me only about 1/4 of the worth.  Now this was not really a problem because I said no to some of the bigger items and took them home with me to either give to friends,sell on craigslist, or sell at a garage sale.  However, I did sell some of the smaller items.  I received a small credit ($35) in store which I was thinking would be good to pick up some clothing at later time.    Before I left I asked for a receipt for the items that I was selling and I was refused a receipt stating that they put the credit towards my phone number and they are NOT allowed to give receipts.  This is highly unusual in this day and age and it left me bewildered by their business practices.   Because of the low amount of money that you will get for your items and the strange practice of NOT giving any documentation of the sale to the customer I would not recommend selling items to this company.  It is good to note that the representatives treated me nicely.    The amounts you will get for items are as follows:   Toys: 30% of what they sell it for. Equipment: 40% of what they sell it for.   For example if you bring in a high chair that you paid $125 for new, they can only sell it used so it estimate 60% of original value; therefore, they will sell it for $75.  Now take 40% of the $75, which is $30 and that is the high end of what you may get for your $125 high chair at Kid to Kid.    With the number it is easy to see that it is not worth the gas and time it takes to go to kid to kid.  Have a garage sale be happy.

What a terrible experience.  I went here to legitimately buy a new car.  I was greeted by a salesman named Paul.   The Prius and most of the other cars in the lot didn't have a sticker on them yet.  I asked for a price and he told me he could get it.  We started talking about my trade in and I asked for numbers for the trade in and the price of the car that we were looking at again.  He came back and told me he would get back to me tomorrow because one of there management just shot and killed themselves at their home and the staff had just found out.  I told him OK and asked if that was a Nissan dealership next door as we were also looking for an SUV.  Paul then came back with more paperwork to fill out and asked to run my credit so that we could do numbers on the trade in.  I told him I was at this point uncomfortable and did not even known the price of the car we drove and he was  asking me to run my credit.  He argued with me about the fact that he needed to run my credit.  I again told him no.  After that he came back and told me he was getting a manager to deal with me directly.  I waited 15 minutes no one came so I left.    Then I called them thinking that maybe we just had some major misunderstanding and explained the story.  The person on the phone said he understood and would get a manager to call me back and we could get this all figured out.    Today two days later no call back and no communication on there part at all.  If Riverview Toyota would have taken time to deal with me directly and professionally we may have been in a better situation, however it has been 3 days with 0 communication on their part, too bad for them.   Riverview Toyota has lost a customer and I tell everyone I know what a bad company they are with no regard for following up with their customers.    I took some time to read some reviews and saw all the terrible stories.    ALSO look at the BBB they have an F rating.     http://www.bbb.org/phoenix/business-reviews/auto-dealers-new-cars/riverview-toyota-in-mesa-az-97031981/

The reason this restaurant gets 5 stars is because of the good food to price ratio.  You pay about $8-10 per plate and it is very delicious.   Everything looks and tastes homemade and they tell me they don't use any lard.  I could not expect any better at this price point.  The tacos and the beans are delicious along with the tomato onion, and pepper salsa that they bring out with the chips and salsa.  I have had better taco's but for much more money.  I have never had better beans.    Congratulations on a good food for a good price.

Wonderful just Wonderful... I have been to Centurion Twice and have had a wonderful experience both times.  You get to say hello and talk to the chef owner and he is extremely helpful in picking out wines.  Next up the food is excellent quality and at a decent price.  Expect $15 to $25 per person.  Every time my family and I have gone we have left with all of our plates completely clean and no doggy bags.  That is saying a lot.    I will go back again.  This is exactly what we need in phoenix in order to make downtown thrive.
