JT's receives a lot of praise for their buffalo wings and it is well deserved. We trekked over from old town on our bikes. JT's is easy to get to from the canal. After sitting down at a table we were greeted by the friendly staff. Beers arrived quickly and an order of 12 medium wings were out shortly after. Fried, sauced, and grilled - these wings were awesome - juicy, crispy, and mmm cayenne spicy (adjectives abound!). JT's is a dive bar of the highest quality. We will make this trek again soon!

Great place!  I love that they feature wines from "the little guys."  You won't find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo.  Small business supporting small business... totally awesome in my eyes!  The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah - your food pairings with the wine in the wine 101 course were AMAZING!  Katie, the sommelier, is fun and she knows her stuff, plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone.  I'll be back for sure!

Keegan's is a "go-to" place for me.  Consistently good food that isn't your run of the mill bar food.  Comfort food and pub grub, all with a bit of a twist.  My favorites are the stroganoff, rosemary chicken, and the something something (I can't remember the name - sorry!) garlicky turkey burger.  Happy hour specials are nothing to turn your nose up at either - their grilled chicken wings are phenomenal as are many of the other apps I've tried.

The chicken cheese steak w/ mushrooms and hot peppers occasionally appears in my dreams.  Always great food and service.

I am nothing short of extremely satisfied with Audi N Scottsdale, my salesperson - Brad Burnham, and the finance team. My search for a new car took over 6 months and I think I wound up at Audi 3 or 4 times before finally deciding to buy an A4. Every time I stopped in Brad was happy to let me test drive (again and again) and he graciously answered all of my questions. The finance team was efficient, knowledgable and pleasant - everything you want when making a large purchase. Overall the experience was fantastic and I wouldn't hesitate to refer anyone to Brad and Audi North Scottsdale.

Yay! A quality facility that took excellent care of my dogs.  All of the right questions were asked when we dropped them off, leaving us feeling very good about leaving our pups in their care.  Both dogs seemed happy and stress free when we arrived to pick them up.  My bichon was groomed beautifully - not an easy task, I know!  I am so happy to have found such a great groomer so close to home.

We've now been taking our dogs to Canine Preferred for over two years.  The dogs have started to associate that building with baths and haircuts, so they're not overly enthusiastic to go in, but they're never scared and they're always ok with being handed over to the staff.  The staff at Canine Preferred take great care of our dogs and our foster dogs.  They do a wonderful job grooming my bichon (and I'll admit, I'm picky about the way he looks after a groom) and they also always do fantastic work on the poodles, shih-tzus, bichons, poochons, shi-poo's, lhasas, etc fosters that we've brought in.  I cannot say enough good things about Canine Preferred!

Its a sports bar. Food and drinks of sports bar caliber. Sometimes what you really want is wings and some beer.  Zipps can take care of that for you.

This location messes up orders with ridiculous consistency. Order garlic parm breadsticks and get dry breadsticks. Order a thin crust square cut pizza and get a regular crust half square half triangle cut pizza. Order chicken and get no chicken. I'm done. Supporting local pizza places (who care about having repeat customers) from now on.

I'm in love! We ordered The "Centurion" pizza and lasagna - brought it all home, cracked open a bottle of Italian wine and oh.my.goodness.  The pizza was FANTASTIC and the lasagna wasn't too shabby either!  The store itself carries some unique items - imports - that I haven't seen at other specialty stores in the area.  Defalco's is absolutely worth a stop - check it out!

Ok. Let's start here:  Los Dos Molinos' specialties are New Mexican dishes.  New Mexican, as in "from the state of New Mexico."  Heavy on the chiles, fairly spicy, and very flavorful.  Really good stuff!  But, if you go expecting Mexican food (whatever "Mexican food" means to you), you'll probably leave disappointed.  The carne adovada is what we (I) always go back for.  It is always fork tender, moist, and SPICY.  I typically order the adovada ribs entree and always take 1/2 home.  It's a lot of food and we never pass up the opportunity to order a sopapilla for dessert.  We also really like the green chile stew.  We've always received friendly and efficient service at this Los Dos location.  When they're busy, the kitchen bogs down a bit, but the ticket times never seem to get too long.  They keep the chip bowls full and the drinks coming while we wait.  That's enough to keep us happy!

Chelsea's is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  The service is consistently top notch - free valet, efficient and friendly hostesses, always greeted by a server soon after being seated, and attentive throughout food service.   Some of my favorite menu items are... the brussels sprout salad (with chicken added, it makes a great meal), short rib tacos, chicken nachitos, rotisserie chicken  and green chile mac and cheese.   Non menu item - margaritas, on the rocks, with salt - one of the best I've found in Phoenix!  Their brunch is excellent as well - try their chilaquiles or the short rib hash.  Mmmm... oh and their mimosa specials on Saturday mornings are well worth it too.  A trip to Chelsea's is never a bad idea!

We went to an early afternoon show and it was a terribly disappointing experience. This was our first and last visit to AMC Esplanade. Yes, the drinks are weak and sugary and the food isn't great - but we expected that.  We didn't expect a broken escalator with no direction on how else to find your way up to the theatre, a seat that didn't recline and loudly creaked and groaned every time I moved (I'm only 135 lbs!!!), no soap in the bathroom, only half of the sinks in the bathroom functioning, and a dirty toilet stall. The experience was certainly NOT worth the price we paid. One star added for decent service from the staff in the theatre.

Hidden a bit, but worth the search.  Breakfast was very good, fast, and fresh.  We had the California Club and Breakfast Burrito (w/ chicken sausage) - 2 thumbs up for both.  We'll be back.

Fun place, nice patio, and great staff! I went with a co-worker for happy hour. We enjoyed the Wednesday night fruit and cheese plate for $6 (normally $14, it was a steal!) and a couple different mixed drinks. I also couldn't help ordering a glass of wine - they have a great wine list with a few lesser known wine makers who (imho) make some great wines! I'll be back to try the food someday soon.

I think the definition of two stars sums it up perfectly - "Meh. I've experienced better."  Everything we ordered was decent and edible but nothing was fantastic, nothing stood out, nothing will bring me back here when I know there are better options around.

Brunch was fantastic! Our last minute decision to try The Mission was not a bad one at all. The chicken and waffles was satisfying, surprising, and flavorful. Margaritas are fresh and light - made me miss the ocean breeze of the Riviera Maya! Service was attentive and prompt.

Very nice selection of good quality dishes. As always, "healthy" can easily be undone by cheeses, mayo, and other yummy additions so be careful if your idea of "healthy" is low cal or low fat. The sammiches were fantastic, the dill potato salad - yummy!, and the tots were pretty good. The market itself has a nice selection of items that you don't usually find often in regular grocery stores (five+ types of quinoa! ;)). I'll definitely be back, whether for a specialty grocery item or for a great meal.

Gallo Blanco is a fun, hip place.  We had a great time and cannot wait to return.  We ordered the guacamole (yum, different, but still yum) and the grilled corn as appetizers.  Although the corn is served with a knife so you can politely enjoy it without corn and cheese all over your face... we chose to just go for it and we greatly enjoyed it (even with corn and cheese on our faces).  For dinner we had the Noca Torta and a variety of tacos - fish (grilled tilapia), carne asada, and cochinita pibil.  The torta was stellar - seriously, don't change it one bit and YES get the eggs over easy.  The tacos were delicious, the fish and carne asada were better than the cochinita pibil (surprisingly, because chochinita pibil is (no joke) one of my favorite foods).  For dessert we had crepes with bananas and caramel - it was ok, but I wished I'd selected something else.  The service team was great although, it seemed, they were under staffed.  This was mostly noticeable when we would order another round of drinks.  20-30 minutes later they'd finally make it to our table.  Our waiter continually apologized saying the bar was slammed (yes, I could see how the bar could be slammed with a full restaurant and what appeared to be only one bartender). Hopefully this was just an off night, maybe they had a call in... or maybe its standard.  I guess I'll find out next time we go!

The Parlor used to be my go to place for lunch with co-workers.  Then I changed jobs.  :(  Now, it's a treat and yes, I make the drive for this "treat" fairly frequently because I crave the mushroom and goat cheese pizza.  I've been disappointed by the pasta dishes I've tried so now, I stick to the pizzas and charcuterie board (and occasionally salads).  Their wine list is pretty good and surprisingly, most of the servers are well educated on the wine list!  Two thumbs up for that.  Sometimes the service can be a tad relaxed (read: slow pace) so, if you're there on lunch, do let your server know!  They're attentive and will move things along a bit faster for you if they know you have a time limit.

We've ordered take out from Thai House twice and they are now our go to for Thai.  The panang curry, spice level 4, is awesome.  Great flavors and full of a good amount of meat and veggies.  It's a big container too, at $9.95 its a great value.  Our other favorite is the spicy noodles, spice level 3.  Again, lots of meat and veggies and fantastic flavors.  We think we've dialed in the level of spice we like, for us these levels give us nice heat without an overpowering "my lips are on fire!" burn.  Service is always prompt, ready in 15 mins or less from when we call, and the order is always packaged very well.  Two thumbs up for that alone!  To recap - great food, great prices, great service.

As a Hillside regular I feel 4/5 stars is not quite the perfect rating - I wish I could give them 4.5 stars as 90% of my experiences with the food and service have been excellent.    Those experiences that comprise the 90% include breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.  Amazing pancakes, best bacon in the valley (seriously, big props for the bacon), huevos rancheros yum, chilaquiles to die for, awesome burgers, great beer selection, and I am in love the Cocina 10 items!  The servers are friendly, knowledgeable about the menu (both food and beverage), and make the overall experience at Hillside enjoyable.  The other 10% - the bad - have occurred in the mornings on the weekends when they're in the middle of a rush.  New rule - if I have to wait more than 5 mins for a table at Hillside I have to walk away.  They just don't seem to properly staff those peak times and both service and food quality suffer.  Final words... outside of 8:30am-10:30am on Saturday and Sunday I will continue to visit Hillside for any meal of the day.  Great food!  If you haven't been... go!

One of the few times Yelp steered me in the wrong direction.  Not sure how my experience differed so much from everyone else's but... it did.  I dropped my bichon off this morning for a groom and temperament evaluation.  Picked him up a little bit ago and after getting home I see that three of his nails were trimmed so short that he had clearly been bleeding.  Ouch.  Poor little guy!  That is NOT what I expect from a professional groomer - that's what I expect when I do it myself - that's why I take him to the pros!  They claim to have done an evaluation of his temperament but clearly had not - the dog they described was not how my dog acts around other dogs - unless, I guess, they did it after they hurt him while trimming his nails.  We won't be back.

This location has the WORST delivery record.  Our office is a block a way.  Occasionally they can get sandwiches here in under 30 minutes.  Frequently it takes an hour.  Freaky frustrating!!

Excellent dinner service!  We started with some fun, unique cocktails and the pretzels with fondue.  Then moved on to the market salad.  Dinner was sweet potato tortelli and the turkey sloppy joe.  A glass of chardonnay and a glass of syrah paired nicely with the respective dishes.  Then we finished it all with blueberry cheesecake.  Overall dinner was FANTASTIC.  And the service?  TOP NOTCH!  I think dinner could have been a flop and we still would have left with a good impression of the restaurant due solely to the level of service we received.

Get there early and be obnoxiously picky about where you allow them to seat you.  Do your best to NOT have to be turned away from your table in order to see the stage.  Unfortunately this is where we wound up.  Wait staff constantly crossing between us and the stage, requiring us to pull our legs in to let them pass, pausing to provide necessary service (I understand they're doing their jobs!) right in our line of sight.  Perhaps if the owners hadn't crammed in so much seating?  A little more space would afford everyone a more enjoyable experience.  It would take a heckuva headliner to get me to want to go back to this venue and even then I'll probably think twice about it.

OHSO always makes me OSHO happy.  We enjoy biking the 5ish miles from home to OHSO and hanging out on the patio.  We're actually thinking of getting bike trailer to put the dogs in, because we know they'd love to go to OHSO too!  Overall the drinks are great, service is fantastic, and the food is pretty good (we've found a couple landmines on the menu).  Brunch is an awesome deal - $10 for a brunch entree and it includes an AZ beer or a mimosa (a big mimosa!).

As far as gyms go, Mountainside Pavilions has been my favorite in the valley thus far.  The front desk staff are friendly, smiling as they check you in.  The locker rooms are clean and well laid out.  The cardio equipment is plentiful, although loud, squeaky treadmills do seem to plague them.  Free weights are generally easy to access, not always easy to find space to use them but, at least they're not being mobbed and hogged by mirror loving meatheads (thankfully, this location has very few of those).  There are weight machines for every little muscle in your body and usually these aren't terribly busy either.  The masseuse on site is great too, great techniques and listens to her clients very well.  The one lost star is for my bad experience with the training staff (a few months back).  My complimentary consultation was a bust - being lectured about nutrition, not "only doing cardio like ladies do", etc.  I tried to let him know that I knew that stuff - I wanted to talk about making my workout more efficient, possibly learning new techniques, how to make the most of my time.  Not on his agenda so nope - we're not talking about that.  Then, a half hour into my meeting, he waves to a client and says something to the effect of "sorry to have to cut this short but I have an appointment, not sure how I got double booked."  Huh, ok.  Guess I won't spend my money there.  But, as I said in the beginning, overall, as far as gyms go, Mountainside has been the best I've found in the valley.

Awesome street tacos. Fresh guac. Fresh margs.  Can it get any better? Is this really fast food? Never in my life would I have ever thought I would choose carne asada over al pastor but - well - I guess things change. Honestly, I'm still a bit more than amazed by my experiences here. Nicely done America!

New owners. Service is SLOW. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and carne asada torta. The quesadilla came out eventually, and was cold. The torta followed a few minutes later, and was fresh and good but lacking the "Americas style" addition of jalapeños that we paid for. They no longer serve margaritas (server said they're working on it). This America's location is nothing like it was a year or so ago. I won't return. Too many better options out there.

I've been to Therapeutic Retreat 3 or 4 times for massages and every time I am impressed.  Everything is top notch.  Marie listens well and is very knowledgeable.  I have persistent (read: EVIL) knots in my upper back that most masseuses are unable to work out (or only able to work out by inflicting a lot of pain).  Marie is capable of working out the knots, stretching the tight areas, and doing so without being overly aggressive.  I appreciate all of that very much!  If I splurge for a 90 minute massage, I know that not only will the knots be gone but I'll also walk out of there in a relaxed zen-like state.  Ahhhhhhhh...

The "Morning Squeeze" and no fresh squeezed juice?  Huh.  We were promptly sat at a table when we arrived.  We then waited 5+ minutes before we met our waitress.  Our order came out in a decent amount of time but my biscuits and gravy as well as the accompanying scrambled eggs came out cold.  No check in from the waitress to see how the food was until I had picked my way through 1/3 of the cold dish.  I pointed out what had happened and received no apology, just a whole lot of "and I care why?" attitude.  She retreated into the back room and returned with a zero bill for my breakfast.  That's nice, but still, no apology.  I could continue to ramble on about the remainder of the bad service we received but I'll spare you from having to read it all.  This place is on our "do not return" list.

Great brews and really good pub food!  North Mountain Brewing is in an area of the valley we rarely get to.  Luckily, an alumni volunteer event got us to drive to this side of town.  After the event we were looking to try a new spot, in a place we were unfamiliar with, and Yelp pointed us here!  Thank you Yelpers!  We ordered wings and poutine.  The wings were good (house hot sauce wasn't very hot), but the poutine... well... the poutine was sinfully delicious.  Salty, savory, and cheesy.  Oh man, it feels so good to be so bad.  For beer, we ordered the ALTerior Motive, IPAcious, and the Baby Belgian.  Great quality brews with well rounded flavors and some unique flavor profiles.    Service was friendly and timed very well.  They gave great advice about the food and beer.  Check this place out!

With so many great pizza options in Ahwatukee, and throughout the rest of the valley, it surprises me that Mellow Mushroom thrives and survives.  We did not enjoy our pizzas - they were under cooked, soggy, and the toppings were low quality.  Totally not worth the money!  Two stars for good service and a nice beer selection.

Best burgers in the valley - hands down (JMHO). Fun and attentive servers. You can't go wrong here. My BF and I have tried most of the burgers on the menu and have had no complaints about any of them.  Well, maybe I've complained about one or two being super messy but, in the end - who doesn't love licking sassy sauce off their fingers (and maybe their arm)?  Personally my favorite burger is the Magic Shroom.  Runner up is the Buffalo Bill, or maybe the Terlingua?  The fries are crispy, not greasy and awesome with a side of green chile queso (*drool*).  Also, the salads - yes this is a burger, fries, and shake place BUT - they make great salads!  Spinach and arugula plus a turkey burger patty is yummy and, to my surprise, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything (burger, fries, shake) when I order it.  The ordering process seems to bother some people but remember these key points...  1) The line moves FAST and the host/hostess will happily explain the process to you if you are confused 2) The servers come around with samples of fries and shakes on a frequent basis 3) The bartender will let you sample beer as you progress in line past the bar but... 4) You don't have to order your first round of drinks as you pass the bar while in line.  The bartender is only asking in case you're thirsty while in line (which you probably are, see #2).   5) Once you're at your table you'll have a server who will take care of everything for you.  Drinks?  Refills?  Sauces?  Shakes?  Yes, the server will handle all of that.  Seriously, if you haven't been - TRY IT!

We moved to the neighborhood nearly three years ago and Little Chicago Pizza was one of our first finds. They quickly became a go to take out option for us.  The pizzas and pastas are fantastic! Their pizza crust is thin, just a touch chewy with a crisp bottom. No, the pizza is not Chicago deep dish, its not trendy wood fired, and its not NY style.  It's awesome thin crust topped with real cheese and quality toppings that have great flavor.  Our favorite pastas include the lasagna and the baked ziti with meatball.  The people working there are friendly, though sometimes they seem to be running a bit short staffed.  Delivery wait times in the evenings are always ridiculously long (usually over an hour).  We don't even bother to ask about delivery anymore.  But, that doesn't deter us, we just order to pick up or we dine in.

Finally headed back to this restaurant after a long hiatus (they closed for a bit and I may have forgotten about them once they reopened, my bad for sure).  We were happy to see that the menu was a bit updated but it really was the same great place it was before.    We have only been here for breakfast and it is always good.  The egg dishes are what I typically go for and I am rarely disappointed.  If you enjoy sweet breakfasts do try Merci's french toast.  It is different but different in a very good way.  Their coffee is great quality and honestly, sometimes I enjoy heading over to Merci just to enjoy a great cup of coffee along side a freshly baked croissant (or chocolate croissant...).

I absolutely LOVE that there are now Zoes locations close to my office AND my home.  Having Zoes nearby makes it really easy to eat healthy on the days I fail to pack a lunch or have no interest in cooking dinner.  On the other hand, Zoes always has those cookies and chocolate cake on display and that makes it really hard to ignore my sugar cravings.  Argh!  But that cake is SO GOOD!  Its ok to indulge once in a while ... right?  My favorite Zoes menu items are the greek chicken pita, gruben sandwich, and chicken kabobs.  The chicken orzo soup is great too.  I also enjoy the selections of iced tea they have available.  The line at this location can be long and sometimes it's hard to find a table after ordering.  Most of the time I use the online ordering option and take it to go.
