Been here many times. Good food and service. Never disappointed. I like the ambience in the room. Light music, dim lights and quiet. Just wish the place is bigger. Not much room to move at the table.

It's nice to have kids build a bear. Unique and kids seem to love it . Expensive! We are going to do it one more time for our kid , that's it!

We took our Chihuahua for Anal gland Abscess. Veterinarian suggested for a surgery worth $400. Our visit with a shot cost us $55. Not sure what the shot is for, if the only option is surgery.  Next I come home to find online that surgery is the most barbaric thing to do with the dogs and is not suggested. I'm going to take that $55 loss and go see some other doctor.  Not to mention, this place is in ghetto, looks and smells like it. Veterinarian couldn't speak good English. I didn't feel like I could get answers from him, so no point in discussing further.   I'm not coming back and will stay miles away from this area!

It's worth it if you haven't visited before.   $20 ticket if purchased at Fry's. $3 soda, $5 beer, $7.50 Turkey Legs, $5 Brownie with Ice-cream.   Remember to bring sun screen and Hat. Be prepared to walk a lot. Things are very expensive to buy. Very busy too.  Lot of shows, little bit of everything for everyone.

Frequent visitor. Quick and convenient. Carne Asada Burrito is decent size and delicious enough. I prefer having burrito here over Chipotle, considering price and freshness

Waiting for over an hour at the Emergency.  TV in the room doesn't work. No doctor yet.   Fuck you Dignity Health.

Mannys alcohol beverage tasted like flu medicine. I would stick with regular domestic beer next time. Didn't like the crunchy Quesadilla, soft one might be better. Carne Asada dinner was really good. Lot of good meat. Service was good, but check up on you every minute literally.   I might come back if I'm in this area of town

Enough variety for me. Only reason I go to buffet - Shrimp, Oysters, Sushi and Salmon. They had all of these, so I'm happy. If you are looking for a quality buffet, skip this one . It didn't look clean and I had my waitress sit on our side table facing us while we eat. Annoyed, but I don't care much. Total bill without drinks, with tax - $22.64.   I will come back here again over Lin's. I won't bring guests here though!

Got some orange chicken and fried rice to go. Fried rice needs some salt. Added pinch of salt, it tasted really good and fresh. Orange chicken was really good too!

Got Sesame chicken large. Taste was alright, but there was whole lot of bread and very little chicken. It should be named Sesame Breaded instead. I feel like all my week of healthy eating was ruined by this meal. It tasted ok though. MCD Asian alternative, made fresh, but very unhealthy!

No complaints. Quiet place, lot of chairs and good service. Just a little unclean, typical of Walmart.

I liked the coconut flavor one. Yogurt here is more thick and delicious than what I have had at other frozen yogurt places on Phx.   I thought seating arrangement could be little different inside. One suggestion or improvement that could be done is to have 1 three seat and  2 two seat couches, total 3 couches, instead of 2 three seat couches.

No wonder this has 5 star. Just the first bite, you can tell its really good. Really creamy, thick and tasty. Easily one of the best icecream I ever had. I'm so glad this is right here in Laveen. Inexpensive and nice service as well.

We went for breakfast, ended up having lunch. That slow and late we got our food. Exaggerating little bit, but be prepared to wait for ever. Food was good, but not worth the wait.

Been here quite a few times. Among the Best BBQ in phoenix! I always get there poboy sandwich $12.99. It can get busy in afternoon's on weekdays. Try to get in early for easy parking.   There is a living social deal , but that's not valid for daily specials or poboy sandwich. IMO deal is not worth it.

Got philly steak sandwich, it tasted good. Bread was alright . Nothing great about the sandwich. But, wow the portion size is really small. I left the place really hungry. It's less than subway 6". Not coming back! If sandwich was bigger and filling, I would give it 4/5 star. Not to mention Tea ran out and had to use lemonade for refill, that I hated all night!

I have been quite a few times. I like the ambience and it is spacious. They have several varieties for buffet and desserts. During my last visit, Ban bread was cold and not great tasting. They brought in fresh Nan without asking, but it was little too late. Chicken in the curry is not much. They have drumsticks, but I like chicken with the curry for Nan. Besides that, no complaints. Service is great. I will come back for sure, little early for buffet for good food.

Bad experience during my last visit. Found few strands of hair in chicken curry, posted picture. Naan bread was really flat and dry. Not much chicken in curry . Lot of variety and some other food was good. Expensive compared to other buffets. Not sure if I will come back

Unique experience. Self service. Wish they had more variety though. Butter Pecan my favorite if all is missing. They have toppings bar for fruits and candy. I like the settings, feels like you are sitting at your living room. It's also quick and easy! I would rate this place 4.5/5, because of lack of icecream variety. I enjoyed fruit toppings. I will come back for sure, even if I had to drive quite far

Terrible service! Had a repair guy come to our house last year. He charged $300 to have freon and replace run capacitors. Few months later, a/c stopped working again. Service guy came in told us there is no Freon and to inspect leak and install a/c, would cost $565!! Looks like the last guy didn't fix the freon leak. However, $565 to fix and add Freon, really?! I'm looking at $900 bill in less than a year.   I'm never calling them and never recommending to anyone.  Not to mention the first repair guy, replaced with old run capacitors. When asked about it, he said new one would cost $200. So, I ok'd to use old ones. Come to find out run capacitors are less than $25!!!  I would never let these cheaters come near by my house again!!!  First guy was - Alex Chavez, second guy - Sal

Cashier at this place, "I don't really like yelp coupons anyways. Well, I don't mind if locals use it, but I don't really like when non-locals use it. Are you local here?"

Wow! Best restaurant food we had all year! Got myself Carne Asada Tacos - $8.95, wife had Fried steak burrito - $8.95. Both loved it. If you are on low calorie, I suggest Carne Asada Tacos. Otherwise Burrito. Burrito is huge ! Got dessert, Churro with Icecream, which was delicious. Margarita, spicy and hot- $7.95. I'm coming back!!

Been a fan of copper kettle on Phoenix for long time, over 8 years. Was very disappointed when they closed down couple years back. Looks like they reopened here in Tempe. Food was really tasty and good. However, they didn't have beef pays and Nihari at the lunch buffet. Very disappointed about that, which are my fav dishes at copper kettle. Other than that, food, service and prices are good. Next time, I'll call first to see if they have beef on buffet, before visit.

Lunch buffet for $6.95!!! Usually Indian Lunch Buffet are no less than $9 . They don't have a whole lot of variety, but enough to keep coming back. Place is really nice, spacious and clean. Service is good, by both elderly men that are really nice and fill your glasses promptly. Watch your step on way to buffet, I almost trip there every time, because of elevation in the floor.   Bookmarked this as our new fav Indian lunch buffet. Coming back for sure!  If you need lot of variety or very picky about the food, you might not like it. Food is tasty IMO. Naan was really good too!  Update: Been there again for dinner. Same great service and tasty food. Naan bread was the best. My suggestion is to increase curry quantity. Thought its just a little than expected. I will come back for sure !!  Update: 02/21/2014 They increased the lunch buffet price. Not really happy about it. Not much meat either. I might not come back very often.

Best Indian restaurant I have been! I have been to easily over 300 Indian restaurants in last 10 years. Place was spacious, nice decor and our waiter was very welcoming. We ordered Goat Korma and Chicken Tikka which was very delicious. I have ordered medium, it seemed little spicy for medium, but loved the spice as I took more bites.   Naan was good and service was really good too. I will be coming back for sure!  My wife'r rating was 4.5/5 conservatively, as she said.
