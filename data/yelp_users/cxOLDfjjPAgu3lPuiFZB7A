We have been coming to this place for years and it never disappoints. I just wish we could come more often! I've had some of the sushi and the miso with salmon ramen, which I definitely recommend! My daughter says this is her favorite restaurant. She loves the cha-shu ramen and a pork dish that I can't remember the name of, guess we will have to go back to find out!!!

Our insurance changed... So that meant we had to look for new doctors. I was happy at the place we were at and felt a bit anxious looking for a new place. I found Central Phoenix Eye Care thru our vision insurance website and then the reviews on Yelp. I have no regrets! This place is awesome! Everyone is so helpful and friendly! Dr. Mastores is amazing and is very patient. I have never had such a thorough examination. I guess I never knew what I was missing. If you are like me and unsure about a new place for your eyes... Look no further! This place is it.

This was my first sushi experience..Yeah, I know, thats pretty lame. Anyways, back to Zen 32.  I did like the place, the waitress was nice and service was fast, once we got seated ( that took a while, and we sat outside, cause it would have been midnight if we would of wanted seating inside). I enjoyed the sushi we all ordered.  Most of it , I hear, was the basic, not exotic type of sushi.   We all shared, california rolls, shrimp tempura, philly rolls, spicy tuna, and some weird sweet like tootsie roll. I thought all of it was good, and so did the rest of the people that I was there with.    I did not try the dessert, but, someone at our table did order a chocolate type of dessert, it looked pretty, but definitely NOT worth it.  It was more like a giant brownie, I don't know about you but, I'm not paying $10 for a brownie. Just walk on over to the Gelato Spot afterwards instead. Oh, yeah, PARKING SUCKS!!! Try Safeway, down the way from it, it might be your best bet.

Came in for the first time due to a great groupon deal... And I got to say, I would most certainly come back here. Everyone I encountered was very friendly and respectful. I knew of a couple issues with my vehicle coming in, and they did bring them up with a price quote and explanation of what the problem and how they fix it. There was absolutely no pressure to get it fixed right that second... So needless to say, they have earned my future business.

Still waiting after an hour wait... No update as to when we will be boarding, no nothing!! Customer service is not anything  Greyhound cares for. This has been a horrid experience. I wonder how much longer we will be here . . . Update: we have now been here over 2 hours... Seriously... What the!?!?

Excellent dental experience. Dr. Shim and entire staff have been amazing! Dr. Shim explained each step as he went making it a more comfortable experience since sometimes you wonder what all is going on in your mouth as you hear the drilling and such. His staff was very helpful, kind, and understanding

What a great experience it was with Dr. Battersby!! An incredibly nice and genuine doc! I thought they were extinct... Like the last one was spotted perhaps 50yrs ago. I would def recommend him! He is super professional, takes his time, LISTENS, and very knowledgable!

I love this place enough to spend 75% of my lunchtime driving to get to it on occasion. Everything I have tried is absolutely delicious! I've had the gyro salad, and the grilled chicken salad.  Mmm mmm good! The sauce they use is very flavorful, and the pita bread is great.

I love this place! So, yeah, its not the most awesome looking place, but the food and service is THE BEST! I am definitely not a Chinese food professional, but I DO know that lady there (Tam) is SOOO nice, and she really cares that you, the customer, enjoys the food.  I just can write on and on about the service, so I hope you check it out and see for yourself.  Oh, and to top it off, the prices are great.

This is a great gelato place.  They have  a pretty good selection of gelato, and the staff is very nice. The flavor and smoothness of the gelato was awesome. I've had gelato that has been more icy then creamy, this is SO not the case.  I will DEFINITELY be back to try other flavors. It is in the same area as Zen 32 and they share the parking problem. (I went on a weekend night, so that just might be a bad time) You can also check out their "Flavors of the Month Calender" @ gelatospot.com.  Also in case this matters to anyone, they have wifi.

I CANNOT believe that I have not rated this place yet... what the?!?!? I LOVE it here. Every time I have tried something different and every time I  am glad I did. This place is not only great but everyone is nice.  Ive even waited outside in the summer...that alone should say something!!

I'm not to sure about a lot of things, but one thing that I can positively say is that Ice Tango is the most kick ass yogurt place ever in AZ.  I first got addicted to Pinkberry and ever since then, I've been dying for that indescribable taste. Ice tango has that awesome unique flavor in its twangy yogurt and fruit.  I love it!  It is VERY recommended, and if you are sitting there thinking of going, STOP, don't even think, grab your keys and head on over there!!!!  For some of us, it is a little far, but believe me, it is SO worth it! And the hours make it so much easier, open till 10pm, come on! I LOVE YOU ICE TANGO!

I have been a MAC customer for years. I know what I use and every once in while I try something new. I have been to this store in particular the most. EVERY SINGLE TIME that I am helped by anyone BUT Jessica (which I havent seen in a lonnnngggggg time so she may not be there any more...sad day)  they are rude and stuck up. For example, the last time I went,  I went in asked for what I needed to purchase and the person helping me (all I got was an employye id off my reciept) did not even look at me when she asked if that was all I needed. She kept looking around and was ubber rude. As she's ringing me up a couple girls that seem like that might have more money than I do walk in, well, the girl wanted to jump over the counter to help them, clearly MAC must work off commission and my poor $60 purchase was not enough for her to appreciate me as a customer.  Her friendlyness was amplified with them. In the end...I hung out looking a few other things and those girls just walked out with our purchasing anything. HA!!! suckaaaaaaaa!!!! You got nada. Sadly I LOVE the product but I am going to quickly look for replacements. I use a whole lot of MAC products, so I end up spending usually a lot more there and I would rather spend my money where they value me as a customer as much as a beach blonde super tan girl holding keys to a Mercedes. So if you have to purchse MAC.. try a different store or shop online... they frequently send out free shipping emails once you subscribe. For now... online will be the way to go for me.

This place earned a few more stars because I gave them another shot and  it was actually a good experience. The gentleman that helped me was awesome! It was a busy Wednesday morning and there were only 2 employees. They kept their cool and he kept track of the order that people came in. He didn't rush thru anyone's needs and had excelled  customer service skills. I wish I would have taken his name because , you sir.. You alone have made this snobby, crappy customer service MAC store a better place. Well done.

I've been a customer of AT&T for over 10 years, and have been to a few different stores whether it was to get a new phone or to add a line. I have been to this location a few times and each time I regret it. Each time, it takes them a long time to even acknowledge a customer. Today we were in the area and decided to try to go in and get a phone for our daughter.. Well after waiting about 15 minutes and several employees making eye contact with us, not ONE acknowledged that we were there or asked if we needed help or even just to let us know that they will be with us in a little bit. I don't mind waiting and I do recognize that everyone is important, but just saying "we'll be with you soon", would be nice (basic customer service, I'd say)

Honestly an amazing place and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. I would definitely recommend Anthony. You can really tell he has a passion for what he does! I went in unsure of what I wanted and he threw out a few suggestions which I went for and I do not regret it one bit!! My hair is a nightmare to deal with, even for me, and Ive dealt with it for 30 years or so.. :) Anthony did a wonderful job with it which I am so excited about. But wait.. there's more.... he also educated me on the best way to care for my hair! say what??!! Don't hesitate...schedule! You wont regret it... AND OMG the most relaxing hair experience you will EVER have. No doubt.

Cajun fries with vinegar (dont judge me!!): GOOD! Burger with everything (including grilled mushrooms and onions) plus A-1 sauce: GOOD! Very nice staff: GREAT High tech soda machines: AWESOME! People that compare to in & out: boo! Of course it's a bit more here...but I think it's worth it.. Or maybe I'm just not an In & Out fan, sorry.  I guess I only review places I really really like. FYI the "little" burgers are a single patty while the regular burgers are double... I didn't know that but the guy at the counter offered this info.

I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo glad we found this place...... because the experience has been wonderful! They have been very welcoming and helpful throughout our wedding planning. Every one there has not only helped us out with the venue but have also offered ideas that have been great!! The place itself is amazing!!!! I am so excited to be getting married in such a gorgeous rustic venue!!!! Im not sure why the first reviewer would automatically go towards personal attacks on people that she doesn't know...but I guess everyone is different in the way they express their frustrations.  Our wedding is coming up so I will follow up with a post wedding review... up to now, it has been nothing less than amazing!  *****UPDATE******* We had our wedding there a couple weeks ago and just as promised here is an update.... NO CHANGE.. Jenny and her staff continued to be their helpful, amazing, friendly, fun selves. Our wedding turned out to be everything we had imagined and hoped for thanks to these fine people and their exceptional establishment (of course we also give credit to our family, friends and other wonderful vendors, but it would have not be the same without WTR). Everything was perfect! The Whispering Tree Ranch staff is the best you can find. I think Im already having WTR withdrawls, I might have to go visit just to take in a little more of the absolute wonderfulness that is Whispering Tree Ranch and the staff. :)

Amazing customer service. We were unable to use their services due to our very distant location but Trey answered all my questions. He was courteous and informative.. Which is not the usual when you are not going to be an actual customer. Thank you so much!!

We are so thankful that we got referred to Collin at Environmental Pest Control. Excellent communication and customer service!!! He throughly explained what things were, took his time and that was all before he even knew that he had our business!! There was no pressure after he gave us the quote but there was no doubt we would use this company for any pest control needs. (In this case it was termites) They really care about the customer. They are prompt and accommodating. Gabriel was the technician on the job and we really appreciate his flexibility and work ethic! Thank you!!!

Deliciousness! We tried the fresh shrimp rolls, shrimp wonton soup, shrimp pad Thai and red curry with chicken. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! It was freshly made and the veggies that were nice, crisp, fresh ones! The flavor of the the pad Thai was flavorful and not salty.  Also , the customer service was great! Super nice and friendly waiter!!!
