Dr.Bell is the best pcp I've ever seen. He takes his time with you and explains why it is or is not a particular diagnosis. The only reason I don't want to sing praises for him is because I don't want to make it harder to get in to see him! He's wonderful and I very much appreciate his bedside manners.

I don't even know where to begin. Long story short, the best part of a $50+ meal (for two of us) was the bread. The free bread. Chicken, steak, mashed potatoes, shrimp, even the salad - waste of money. And then, to top that off, when we strapped a pair on to complain they took our names and phone numbers to "put on the books" for a discount next time. Nice job Outback. You must know there won't be a next time.

We love this clinic! We frequently stop by for prescription dog food and they are quick and helpful. We've made appointments and seen Dr. Greenwood who is so sweet and helpful in soothing my over protective mom worries. And we've even had to come once for a semi-emegency of our dog eating something he shouldn't have;  they were kind on the phone and didn't push anything unnecessary once we were there. We'll definitely keep entrusting our fur babies to them.

The service here is atrocious; specifically at the bar,  where service is better in literally every other restaurant ever... on more than one visit, not only did they forget to place our order, but they also placed it incorrectly and brought the wrong item. AND THEN there isn't even an apology. Dude, you're not busy... there is no excuse. Only perk is the late night hours but that's hardly a perk when it's breakfast by the time you bring the water I asked for 2 hours ago. It's cool, Ra. I tip appropriately.

I love the beer selection, food is mediocre, the service is always slow; tonight takes the cake for experiences though - while sitting at the bar, we noticed a COCKROACH crawling on the taps. Disgusting. Where there's one there is more. Kid bartender didn't know what to do when he finally emerged for me to point it out. I'm not sure I can return after that discovery. #dirtydining

Sophia was great! Based off of yelp reviews we called to see if an artist would be available for my girlfriend and I to walk in the same day for one small watercolor piece; we were given to Sophia and she did a fantastic job! She is very nice and relaxed and helpful with nervousness (this was my girlfriend's very first). I last minute decided I wanted to get something small as well and she was not only accomodating to fitting me in, but she seemed genuinely excited about the design we visualized together. I will totally come back to work with her again and recommend the shop as a whole to anyone looking for a great experience.

Here's a novel idea, don't sell me something you don't have, come after me at the soda station to semi apologize, and then ONLY refund me that burger. Sales 101, that's not good business. In case anyone is wondering why this place is always empty, there's one idea.

The service from the staff is always very nice here, however, I'm pretty sure I just pulled half a worm out of the middle of my chicken breast. It has ridges like a worm, is the right diameter of a worm and the chicken itself wasn't really stuck to it. In fact, that's how I found it because it didn't pull apart like the meat. If this is a tendon it is the oddest tendon I've seen. I blame the source of the chicken, not the store,  of course. But Oh. My. God. I think I'm going to throw up.

This is a great new place near downtown! They have an awesome and HUGE draft beer selection that is ever changing, making each visit a new adventure of beer (be daring and step outside your comfort zone!) The food is also awesome and not your typical bar cuisine, and the interior is super hip and well done. Only bummer is I am not to the point where I'm drinking alone, with no one to talk to and the music is a little too loud for socializing. So there's that. But if you're a bar fly only sitting at the bar top alone, you shouldn't have any complaints. :)

This is one of my current favorite sports bars! Love their beer on tap and I'm obsessed with their mac and cheese! The female bartenders are friendly and seem to remember us; one male bartender in particular needs to take a better cue from his coworkers... you cost your location a star, pal.
