Today me and my boyfriend ate at this location I had the jamaican chicken pizza with glaze it was very sweet I thot it could of used more marinara so our waiter ceil was very outgoing and polite she accommodated us both with free extra marinara sauce it made the pizza much better. My boyfriend on other hand originally ordered the toastada pizza with black bean chips lettice and much more. It didn't have alot of flavor or cheese. So we let Ceil know about the taste of the pizza. Ceil was very polite she let her manager know and they offered my boyfriend a new order for a new pizza that he would like. They didn't charge him for the old pizza he didn't like because they wanted him to be satisfied.  I also ordered the tortilla soup it was spicy and thick very delicious.  At the end of our meal the manager offered me the soup for free. I would highly recommend this location to others the workers and manager is very professional and polite they also serve the food quick.

My dog chewed up my laptop charger so I had to buy a new one it lasted a while maybe 5 months. If you own a asus laptop asus does not make replacement chargers my original manufacture charger stopped working 1 year after my boyfriend bought my laptop as a anniversary gift. So you gotta buy the universal chargers its a bit pricey prices range from $60-$80 dollars. I got the insignia brand hopefully it will last longer than the original asus charger.

I gotta say SPROUTS is my Favorite store to shop at I enjoy shopping at this spouts location twice a week. They always have great prices and the best food! They always have food sales today I stocked up on the Annie's box Mac & Cheese the sale price is $1.50 per box the original price is $2.50 I come here to buy milk because the milk at other super market s taste old I hate the taste. Some other great items to buy here is gluten free pancake mix, coconut flour and almond flour mix it together to make some great tasting pancakes I cook this all the time add bananas and blue berries ontop with Agave.

I was grossed out because I found a short piece of hair in my bagel. The owner should conder the workers to start wearing  hair nets since they are dropping hair in people's food. Always check your food before you eat otherwise you might end up eating someone else's hair.

Pizza is very delicious they have a lot to choose from. The pizza is a little oily the slices are very thin. I think pisa pizza and rosattis are the two best pizza spots in fountain hills. But I gotta say it does not taste like New York pizza.

This is definitely a great bodega to stop into when buying a snack or drink. They got a drive through which is very convenient, the owners have always ben very friendly and cool people. The price for some of the liquor is more expensive than what you pay at the grocery.

Me and my boyfriend come here all the time. I absolutely love this place. Never have I left unsatisfied. I like the way they make their chicken. It has the perfect indian taste. You have to try the naan bread and samosas. They have this thing called popadum or something like that its like a cracker with pepper on it, you have to ask for it, ITS SO GOOD!! You dip it in a green  sauce that you find by the rice. Best indian food in town! Great buffet! And best of all the price is unbeatable. Nice quiet atmosphere. I love the vibe I get from the workers. They always treat us well and make me laugh and don't forget to try the Jamaican beer or indian taj mahal beer

Great place to watch movies because they play the most movies throughout the day. Other harkin  theaters limit to how many movies they show a day they don't always show every movie that has been released Arizona Mills does show most movies

THIS PLACE IS A SCAM! DO NOT GO THERE!  Before my visit got started I made it clear to all the medical people at the front desk that I only wanted to get services that my insurance covers. I do not want to pay anything out of pocket other than a co pay. The doctor does a eye exam without me knowing they do a contact exam. At the end of the visit they tell me if I do not buy contacts from them then I have to pay for my own exam. They never told me this option before the exam after I told them I do not want any services that requires paying out of pocket. now they are refusing to give me my prescription! My insurance plan pays 100% of both exams. Now they want me to pay out of pocket and they are forcing me to buy their contacts that I never wanted because they are overpriced! The doctor recommended I wear glasses. They are trying to scam people out of their benefits forcing people to buy their overpriced contacts and pay out of pocket. That is a service I never wanted if I have to pay im trying to get the best price for my glasses. The dr. recommended Glasses anyway. They need to make people aware of this charge or choice before doing the exams.

I recently moved back to Az from NYC I haven't ben to this location maybe 10 years. I gota say this motor vehicle location is packed! Expect to wait atleast 1 hr. Only if your going during the afternoon. I dont know much about the morning traffic. But if your in a hurry I always go to the 3rd party mvd location near raintree and the 101. They changed my new york plates and registration less than 15 minutes. Dont think iam coming back to this location because I like my service to be done quick I don't got free time to be waiting around for these slow ass workers. Plus they need to clean them nasty ASS Restrooms with all our tax dollars!

I bought a Michael Kors coat for my 11 yr old son at the Macys Fashion Square. They sent me to this store to exchange the medium coat for a small. The guy was a complete asshole doing the exchange!!! After paying  $180 he Tells us we can't wear the jacket out of the store or security will tackle us. That is the rudest thing to say! Macys needs to teach their employees to keep their rude comments to themselves or just fire them people. What a HATER!

Great place to go for a late night date! My boyfriend took me here tonight I got a delicious smoothy with cherries, pineapple,  low fat yogurt and superfoods. I also tried the homemade Hawaiian roll which was very good. The place reminded me of a coffee  caf√© in nyc.  They sell a little bit of everything. You can sit and chat with your partner or friends any time of night because it's 24 hrs. Its a great place to go. It definitely BEATS Starbucks!  Starbucks is boring compared to this place. They offer a whole lot more.

Last weekend on February 7th 2015 my boyfriend and family celebrated my birthday at lucky strike. My boyfriend is from NYC and I use to live there too, I'am always looking for the hottest places in the valley and this is 1 great spot. I like this place because it reminded me of the bowling alley on times square. We all had a great time thanks to our hostess/server named Lauren she was always there to serve us. I believe the server can give you a great or shitty experience. But Lauren she gave us a awesome experience! She served our meals and drinks quickly through out the whole night, she kept our table clean and clear always brought new dishware. We had a group of 10 people so we had a overload of food all of us was pleased with her professionalism and quickness. We must have asked her to serve us at least 10 times she worked quickly stayed kind, cheerful and funny, brought laughs to all of us. I've had rude servers in the past but Lauren treated us great I'am glad she didn't get annoyed. She always stopped by to see if we needed anything she arranged for my cake to be stored in the fridge I was a bit worried because my boyfriend spent $350.00 on the cake she reassured us everything will be fine and so on. I'd have to say lucky strike has a great worker  I think she should be recognized as employee of the month and for being such a hard worker possibly give her a pay increase for such outstanding work ethics. Thank you Lauren for making my birthday a great night! Next time you go to Luck Strike ask for Lauren she's a great server and don't forget to give her a BIG TIP!

I enjoy eating here they have a lot of great food but lately everytime I order hot wings they would serve me old carrots that is not fresh. It does look gross. If your going to give carrots atleast serve them fresh! Otherwise don't give them with the meal. it would only be a waste I throw them away every time.

Sharp pains in my head and my teeth is aching after getting fillings Today 2/9/15 my head is throbbing will not go away. I dont know how long the pain is supposed to last I went to Dr Hyung for the 1st time for a teeth cleaning they took Xrays and said I need 6 fillings 3 on right 3 on left. As they added the filling I could see the reflection of them working off the light above me. I already had fillings from my previous dentist. It looked like they took out the old filling and put in a new filling. after the 3 fillings the dr drilled 3 more holes in my teeth and added filling.  The other 3 cavities was supposed to be on the left side of my mouth. No work was done to the left side of my mouth. I asked them to show me where is these other 3 cavities on the xray? But they said you cannot see them you can only see them by looking at the teeth.  Its ben 8 hrs and Iam in alot of pain I think I hope to feel better in the morning.

Iam very skeptical about this place dont let the beautiful atmosphere deceive you. I went in 10 days ago for a scheduled teeth cleaning. As a new patient they took xrays of my teeth I was told I had 6 cavities I need filled. I go to the dentist all the time and I take verry good care of my teeth this was a surprise to me I thought it was weird. I trusted the professionals to fix 3 of the cavaties it turns out 3 of the cavities barely showed on the xray almost like they wasnt there. They convinced me they were cavities that was below my previous 3 fillings so they took out my old cavity filling and refilled them. I was told they was only going to fix 3. The doctor continued to drill into my teeth to fix 3 more cavities that did not show on the xray at that time I trusted what he was doing. After the visit I was in extreme pain for 2 days its ben 10 days and the sharp pain in my teeth has not went away it hurts when I eat or bite my teeth together Ive never had this kind of pain ever before from my previous fillings. I still have 3 cavities in my mouth that need to be fixed but now Iam scared I do not trust any doctors to touch my teeth. I would not recommend this dr office to anyone. What was weird they kept mentioning you have really good health insurance now I wonder did they do that just to make money? For now on its best to go to phoenix mesa or Chandler this is the last time I will ever see a dr in Scottsdale.

Its my first time eating a cupcake here. The have a whole lot of sugar its extremely sweet but very good the cupcakes are large.  I could  barely  eat 3 bites because its too sweet. I tried the doondah cupcake  it is vanilla  cake with a thick layer of frosting covered with sprinkles.  If you like to sit they have massage chairs right in front of the cupcakes store so you can enjoy  your cupcakes and massage.

Today I bought a new bed for my son this place definately has great prices Jose and paul was very nice and they offer no credit check financing delivery within 5 days. They dropped the price to help me stay in my budget. Verry nice people family owned they don't have a lot of furniture on display because the store is small.  The price is affordable Iam definitely coming back I recommend this place to anyone.  They gave me free delivery along with a free memory foam pillow for checking in on yelp. I am excited to sleep on it tonight definitely go to this store. I will be posting again in a few weeks about the quality of my sons new bed.

I bought a twin bed for my son about 2 months ago the price was $400 it took about 3 weeks before it was delivered so don't expect your furniture to get delivered right away. The only thing I dont like is the bed frame is very high from the ground I was expecting it to be a lot lower like every other bed. I thought the box spring was going to be thin but instead its thicker than the mattress so the bed is very high my son is 10 yrs old and he has to jump to get on the bed every time he it annoying. Idk if theres any way tower it but after looking it seems like there isn't. Jose said the bed had a drawer under it but i didn't want the drawer but he didn't tell me there would be this huge space under the bed otherwise I would of never bought the bed it kinda looks crazy! Well its very sturdy and good quality it seems like it will last a while  its better than the wal mart bed lol

Very nice dr office service is very quick and the dr is straight to the point and knows what medicine to treat the concerned area of my skin.  DO NOT GO TO SPECTRUM DER DERMATOLOGY on camelback rd in phoenix.  They were rude as hell they said it was untreatable and wanted me to pay money. I recommend this doctor office

we go to this location every few month we even buy bottles of Don Perignon there.  I do not like the way that Liz the cashier treats me it has become a huge problem! The last visit she tried to steal my personal information off my drivers license for NO reason at all when we was paying for our drinks after carding me she started writing my information down on a blank piece of paper! I was outraged that a Caucasian lady would steal my identity in front of my face! I had to stop her! There was a long line of people paying before I got to her she did not ask for their ID. Most the customers were Caucasian and I am Native American. Today I visited the store and Liz did not ask the 5 people standing in line before us for any ID because they was Caucasian and they looked pretty young. Im in my 30's apon paying she answered a phone call she responded yes they are right here as if the employees were stocking us as we walked around the store!  she then carded me and my partner. I confronted her saying she didn't ask the other people for ID. She replied its policy. Liz shouldn't be racially profiling people! This is illegal for her to sell alcohol and not  ask for ID. She needs to be fired. I m Native American the employees should not be treating customers disrespectful like this it is not acceptable.

The food made me sick we ate there for lunch. It was delicious but I was throwing up all day! I had a migraine that would not go away until 10pm. I fell asleep for hours. I wonder what did they put in the food. If you want to enjoy Indian Food  dont go to any buffet go to a restaurant that makes it fresh! Eventhough its a very nice restaurant I do not recommend going to this place because of how I felt.
