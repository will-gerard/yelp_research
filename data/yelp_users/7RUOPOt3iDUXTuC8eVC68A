I am really surprised that Salon Surreal has received such positive reviews. I mean, *really* surprised. I went (on these Yelp recommendations) and immediately wanted to call Tabitha for a salon takeover.   I went in for a manicure/pedicure and was able to get in the same day. Parking was a bit of a struggle on a weekday afternoon but not too bad. When I walked in I was greeted by a full wall of products. That's all you see. Just this huge wall of products.   I think Huey Lewis and the News was on the sound system, too.   I went to check in and there were lots of young girls--none of them with fabulous haircuts--standing around the front desk. They checked me in and I waited for my nail tech, who showed up and gave me the weakest handshake ever. I almost laughed and could barely hear her. She was perfectly nice and polite, but it was just awkward.   She took me back and gave me a class of water, which was nice, and then started on my hands. I didn't have much to say to her (and couldn't hear her over the N'Sync song on the stereo) so I just looked around as she clipped my cuticles. The place is a cluttered mess. I couldn't believe it. There's just stuff everywhere. Photos, pieces of paper, knick-knacks, stacks of towels, old chairs and nail accessories. Clutter clutter clutter. And on top of the clutter was lots of dust. It was gross.   The decor is this weird early 90s red/black/contemporary thing going on. Oh and did I mention the music? Yeah. I admit that bad music stresses me out--I'm just that kind of person--but this was so bad that if I heard it at a bar or a coffee shop I'd turn around and walk out. And it wasn't even "dentist's office" bad. It was worse than what you'd hear at Applebee's.   My pedicure was better because I could just sit there and let her do her thing and bury my head in a magazine. There were a lot of staff standing around still, too. One had a laptop open.  I suppose the most non-relaxing thing I experienced was the smells. This salon uses Creative nails and the lotions and accessories all reek of fake fruits and flowers. It was nauseating.   When I left I went back to use the restroom and passed by the huge washing room and several dozen lockers where I suppose the staff keeps their stuff? It all just screamed "factory" to me. The bathroom, too, was this weird mish-mosh of contemporary (not modern) and Tuscan.   There is nothing soothing about this salon. And as a new client I was shocked they didn't offer me a discount. Instead, I paid $90 after tip for my mani/pedi. And sure enough, my cuticles were ragged and unfinished and after a week my toenail polish is chipping.   On Newbury Street in Boston I paid $45 for a pedicure that lasted me 3 weeks. If you like the kind of salon that's calm, relaxing, serene, and upscale, this is not your place. If you like fun and action and don't care so much if you have to go back every week because everyone there is so much fun, then this is your place. Personally, I like calm and quiet and quality.

Wow. Get ready for the hard sell at this place.   Since I moved to Phoenix a little over a month ago, I've been quite surprised by the number of car wash businesses around here. "It never rains," I thought. "Why so much need for car washing?"  I have since realized that the dust makes me want to keep my car clean. Plus I'm just *in* my car a lot more now than I used to be when I was living in Boston. Getting it washed every two weeks or so feels normal out here.   I stopped by Prestige on a Saturday afternoon just to get a quick full-service wash on my way home. It was shocking how many times I had to say "no" to the attendants, all who offered to buff out a dent, shampoo my upholstery, and replace my entire windshield. I had to keep saying "not this time, guys. Just the car wash."   The wash itself took a pretty long time (a good 15 minutes) and I was waiting in their dirty lobby area for a while with many others who were also waiting. They finally finished the car and while they did an OK job, it was nothing to write home about. Certainly not worth all the hassle.

I can't believe I waited this long to try Lux. I'm new to Phoenix and had just about given up on trying to find a place to go and sit and work around creative people AND get good coffee while I'm there. As an academic, I've kind of built my life around working in good coffee shops. So when I moved here I figured I'd have to rethink all of that. Not so! Lux is my new fave.   The coffee is real: espresso drinks are made by hand, not machine. I agree with others here that the beans aren't that great though. Even though it's not the absolute best coffee I've ever had (I'm a lifelong Peet's fan), it's certainly not reason to skip going here.   On the other hand, the service is AMAZING. They remembered my name, made sure I got stamps on my frequent buyer card, and offered to heat my croissant in a REAL TOASTER and not some lameass microwave. I got a nice little pot of jam and a smear of real butter, too. They seemed to know I was new there, which indicates to me that they have a ton of regulars and make a sincere effort to get to know them.  There are plugs and free wifi and I don't feel pressured to leave before I'm ready. Lots of great people-watching, too. (Last time I was there, a woman in her mid-30s wearing a Slint t-shirt came in with her kid-- very cool.) There's nothing dirty about this place and I don't feel like I'm sitting in someone's basement, drinking coffee off of thrift store furniture. It's very much an adult coffee shop that encourages you to hang out for a while, either indoors or out. (FYI, there are nice benches and grassy spots around the building in addition to the tables under the awning out front.)  I only wish it were bigger, a little quieter, and much closer to where I live. I also wish it opened before 7 but that's just because I need something to make me want to get up earlier and get working.   To be honest, since I moved to Phoenix 6 weeks ago I thought I was doomed to a life of grading my students' papers from any number of commercial or mediocre coffee shops. I have also had a hard time finding places to go where my people are at. You can imagine what a sigh of relief I expressed when I settled in with my cappuccino at Lux. So nice to be there.

I've come to like Solo quite a bit. I'm a professor at ASU and like to do a lot of writing off campus (continuing a habit I picked up in grad school). Solo is great for that. Meets my criteria: *decent number of outlets for laptops *seats that aren't too tiny and uncomfortable *free wifi (ask barrista for password) *espresso ground by hand, not by a machine *skim milk available *plenty of parking *air conditioning not too strong *not too crowded *music not too loud  See? I'm picky about my coffee shops. The only downsides I've found are: *there's really no food at all except for the limited number of bakery items they receive each morning *like most coffee shops, pretty bad art and a lot of dust everywhere *too small  As far as the coffee goes, it's fine. Not too nutty, not too burnt, not too acidic. I'm just glad to find a shop where there are no automated espresso drinks.   Oh! And the biggest plus: friendly staff of adults who know what you're doing and why you're there and won't bug you so you can get your shit done. A++ WOULD BUY AGAIN.

I just moved to Phoenix and found these therapists online. I went in to see Trina this weekend and was so impressed I had to make sure to add them to Yelp as soon as possible.   I chose Rustic Sage because I have always had good luck with massage therapists who work at places that only do massage. When I lived in Chicago, I went to Urban Oasis, when I lived in Boston, I went to Inman Oasis (not affiliated) and here in Phoenix, my choice is Rustic Sage. These women are exclusively there to work on your body in a serious way. This is not a salon or even a beauty spa kind of place. Instead, it's about healing yourself physically and mindfully. Trina, my therapist, genuinely wanted to help me feel good so I can maintain peace of mind.   If you're the kind of person who is looking for someone to help you figure out why your back hurts or what the source of that knot in your shoulder is, this is a great place to go. I have been seeing massage therapists for a long time and never received the kind of treatment before that I got from Trina. She helped me work out the pain in my hips and my IT band and afterwards even showed me some exercises to do in-between appointments.   I also like this place because it's not *too* Zen. I like the nature theme and the peaceful lighting but it's not cluttered or too homey. It's clean, modern, and when I visited I immediately felt calm and quiet.   Trina and Wendy told me that they're moving to a new space (the Fifth Avenue Downtown Scottsdale address) on September 11. They're having a grand opening and will soon have more therapists; they'll add yoga classes as well. As I left my appointment I met the yoga instructor, who was coming in to see Trina for a massage. She told me about the classes and seems like a truly smart, kind, down-to-earth person to take a class from. I'm definitely signing up.   Having just moved here I can't believe how lucky I am to have found this place! Very highly recommended.
