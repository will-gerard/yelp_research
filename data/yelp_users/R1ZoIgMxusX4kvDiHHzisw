Let me start of by saying I LOVE food, great service, I like to share the enormous portions served in restaurants, drink water with lemon and I do not drink alcoholic beverages.  I know, I scream cheapskate, but I think I deserve a decent 2.5 star experience, at least for the food.  Most places meet or exceed my expectations.  Guiseppes did not.   And there comes a time when my youthful, ethnic appearance, water with lemon, request to share, and sober living is met with that "I am not going to make money off of you" vibe from the owner.  It hasn't happened in a very long time, but Guiseppes proved their still is bad service reserved for their unwanted patrons.  I was very excited to eat here seeing it on Diners Driveins and Dives on Food Network, my favorite food network show, and seeing all of the New Times best of awards.  Got there at 8:30pm Friday night, there were people waiting outside, thought it was a good sign.  Now I thought being in a strip mall, next to the water N ice store, the service would be warm and welcoming and the place would be chock full of non-dbags.  I am always cool waiting a bit for good food but being stared down by rich, overweight women with their husbands in flip flops, cargo shorts and Affliction tees and teenage platinum blondes with their smug smiling boyfriends in their flip flops, plaid shorts, and Affliction tees is never my cup of tea.  Fast forward 30 minutes of this ish we get seated, another 10 minutes menus, another 10 minutes a water and a watered down gross iced tea which they CHARGED us for even though she took it back and gave him water, and by 9:30pm we get our 15dollar saltysaltysalty bolognese ragu with overcooked spaghetti (we didn't get the homemade pasta) to share, 4dollar baby 1/2 inch thin toastettes, and 2dollar marinara bowl for dipping.   (FYI this is an Italian Restaurant that not only makes you pay for an ounce of bread, they also CHARGE for extra virgin olive oil)  So go to Guiseppes if you like:  _"EH" Italian Food _Cold and dry humor from the owner _Slow waitresses _Being stared at by stuffy people in such an unlikely, un-stuffy atmosphere _Your hopes let down =) Enjoy!

Seriously I'm not just talking out of my ass when I announce:  BEST Grilled Chicken and Carne Asada EVER!!!  They only serve grilled (beyond marinated) chicken on the bone and carne asada.  Both of which you may order 1/4, 1/2 or the combo with BOTH (all come with corn or flour tortillas)!  Which explains why such greatness that is 5 stars is involved in the concentration on 2 main items.  Now on to the main points:  -Meal will set you back only $4 to $6 bones per person, cash only  -Chicken may be ordered white or dark and is the most flavorful and crispy grilled, ignore the red-dyed skin, it will be the best grilled chicken you have ever had  -Carne Asada is always cooked to perfection, not overcooked or stringy or chewy, always is Carne Asada greatness  -Not only do meals come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, they come with perfectly salted pinto beans (not refried), fresh salsa, and red onions that seems to have been soaked (not pickled) reducing their flavor to a delicious subtle onion instead of a crunchy onion.  -Salsa is a tomatoey, pureed (not over pureed), juicy salsa that screams freshness with every bite.  -Lastly, the BLISS OF THE FOODGASM experienced when the tortilla/chicken or beef or both chicken and beef mmm/onions/salsa/and sourcream for those that enjoy a lil sin, explode in your mouth with flavors you only dreamed of...is the reason you must GO HERE ASAP

WARNING:  Do not go here after 8pm!!!  I usually eat dinner around 8pm and have usually come to Chino Bandido around 830 or so.  Last week I got there around 815pm, saw a man sampling items and I wanted to try a couple.  I waited behind him at the sampling line and was repeatedly asked by the cashier if I was ready to order, I said no.  Minutes later manager Mona at the sample line told cash register "I dont know what she is waiting for?"  DUH Im behind the guy getting samples so I told her Id like a sample, she gave me a sample of the Jerk Chicken (spicy dry gross).    I wanted to also try the machaca and carnitas but seconds after she hands me my first sample, (the man before me was offered almost everything) she asked me if I was ready to order!  She then told me "you know, we close at 9pm" while my watch said 820pm.    It wouldnt bother me as much if this was the first time I had been there, but there are other factors:  .AGAIN it was 820pm and there was absolutely no sign anywhere saying the kitchen closed at 830pm.  .this was the 3rd time I had been there, after 8pm, and have been rushed and treated like crap.  Sorry I take a whole 5 minutes to decide what Id like to order.  FOOD (I have only tried 3 of their dishes because again I arrive 40 minutes before they close so samples are not an option)  Chinese BBQ Pork  .Tasty some pieces are dry but the moist fatty pieces you  find are delicious.  Jade Red Chicken .Slightly spicy version tastes like mix of orange and sweet sour chicken from Panda Express.  Quesadilla .very cheesy and deliciously crispy.  OH and ordering is the most uncomplicated-made-complicated thing here.  2 stars since ordering and customer service is SOO ridiculously poor.  For me, while their food is good it is SO not worth going here during my dinner time because of their lack of customer service for their repeat customers. =(

After being ripped off at the dealership one too many times...that "loaner" car is so not free at the end of the day... took my 2001 Volkswagen Jetta to Volkwerks.  The owner is a former Volkswagen dealership mechanic.  Fast forward about 4 years and 80,000 miles later ....a couple repairs, some major some minor, this place is the BEST.  Honesty, affordability, flexibility.  Call them for your Volkswagen and Audi needs!

The best diner ever!  WHY you ask:  Service _Fast _Throw any variations, or complicated instructions at them, your dish will still come out perfect. _They will refill your coffee cup or any other beverage before you ask.  Food-Visit 1 $16 bill _Oatmeal, no milk, raisins & brown sugar on the side, 2 slices of Simply Bread Wheat toast dry, 3 egg whites dry, black coffee.  Absolute power breakfast and came out exactly as ordered.  Perfection. _MG had the chicken fried steak, gravy on the side, 2 biscuits as big as your face, hashbrowns and I ate the egg whites.  The steak was also familiarly great, the hashbrowns, crispy and not overly buttery, gravy perfectly salted.  Food-Visit 2 $13 bill _I had the same except for only one piece of toast and it came out screaming perfection again. _MG had the Corned Beef Hash breakfast, again familiarly salty and delicious, with the fluffy Simply Bread Wheat toast, and half a plates worth of hashbrowns, I ate the egg whites.  Food-Visit 3 $15 bill _ I ventured out of my comfort zone and after 2 hours at the gym needed a lil more than oatmeal.  I had a slice of the fluffy toast and a 3 egg white dry omelette with no cheese, moist chicken breast, abundant spinach, light avocado, mushroom and cooked through onion.  It was beyond filling and thoroughly satisfied my tastebuds. _MG had the hashbrowns and biscuitgravy that came from my meal.  Along with some extra sausage patties that were moist and crispy.  Please go to The Place if you are down for great food, great service, great prices.

AWFUL, waste of good bbq money  ATE:  St. Louis Ribs =  dry, like beef jerky, some bones had little to no meat on them.  Biscuits and Honey Butter= dry dry dry biscuit butter was good and had some cinnamon in it  Grilled Corn = delicious, best part of the meal (sad)  BBQ Chicken =  very moist, pretty good, saucy  I came here for tender, meaty, saucy ribs and was sadly disappointed. Visit this restaurant if you like jerky ribs and dry biscuits.

WOW ...  Chicken Pita and Italian Beef beautifully showcased the essence of great flavorful moist meat sandwich-like greatness!    Salad was balanced and fresh and the light lemony greek dressing was too too delicious!  Garlic sauce and Tzatziki was perfection.  READ: Chicago Gyros is the place all of those other "Chicago/Mediterranean Pita" places only dream they could be if they cared enough about the quality of their food...their attention to flavor, texture, balance, and quality is unmatched.  handsdown :)

5 stars usually isnt my thing to do but this is THE barbecue place.  All the things I want from great bbq: -tender meatiness -tasty not too sweet not too smoky bbq sauce -beyond delicious sides -good bread -no bougie prices -friendly attentive service  Well I have found all of this in Town Talk II.  Had the:  RIBS = meaty, tender, peppery cantquitedeterminewhatthattasteis but very delicious bbq sauce at a decent price.  WHEAT BREAD = fluffy, decent 2 slices that came with the ribs.  RED BEANS & RICE = Perfectly seasoned, not beyond salty or overwhelming like some red beans and rice.  loved this.  CREOLE FRIES = perfection of fries since they were lightly dusted with seasoning and salt.  CREOLE STYLE POTATO SALAD = Mustard potato salad had the perfect fluffy mayonnaisy mustard ratio.  The potatoes were much firmer than others but I really like that the were because I hate it when potato in potato salad is too soft and mushy.  It also went omg so perfectly with the ribs.  COLESLAW = Slightly sweet, slightly sour, all good.  They gave me a free sample when I asked if it leaned toward sweet.    BLACKBERRY COBBLER = not overly sweet like most cobblers Ive had...seedy and blackberryish flavors were oozing all over the place with lotsa good crust to make every bite equal crust to filling.  This is THE place for bbq...get there...enough said PERIOD

Meh... definitely the word to best describe this joint.  For $7.30 not including a drink you get a noodle bowl.  You also get to get in on their asian-style fried chicken wings, egg rolls, soups, jello, and fried biscuits with sugar.  For 2 people and 1 drink our total came out to $18.00  Number 1 BOO on the fact they don't allow takeout dishes for an additional fee like all of the other mongolian bbq places.  Number 2 BOO on the fact that its a little steep in price for 1 bowl of freakin noodles with no dream of a doggie bag  Number 3 BOO on the fact that all the servers and cooks have these odd blank stares the entire time we were dining  Number 4 BOO and I know its gross but I gotta keep it real here...we had violent urges to go to the bathroom soon after with pushes of ...ahem ... wind smelling of noodles.... perhaps the biggest POO.. I mean BOO of all =(  and no we didnt "fill up" on a most enormous amount of noodles to deliver such ridiculous movements as our serving sizes were reasonable.  However I cannot BOO on their Fried Chicken Wings.  They were absolutely delicious.  Although one more BOO on them for making us wait 10 minutes for more.  Mediocre Mongolian BBQ.. meh

The "Il Posto" pizza is pizza done so right.  Pepperoni, sausage, bell pepper, red onions, olives, and the light sprinkling of garlic brings it all to greatness on a light thin crust.  The meat tortellini with alfredo AND marinara sauce covered with their thick smooth mozzarella is one of my top 10 dishes of all time.  I get extra of their tasty marinara.  You can't get this anywhere else and the mix of flavors and textures in this pasta dish are unbelievable in your mouth.  The only thing I don't like about here is the service... we have been going here since it was called Our Gang Cafe and the teenage hostesses are pathetic and the servers are a bit douchy.  They chill in the back gossiping like schoolgirls looking around at everyone in the place. When it looks as if your table might need something, they casually get up from their seats as if a burden of service has come upon them. I don't like it.. but I've never known them to be any other way so ehhh.  A good little Italian restaurant, while it may not make you feel all warm inside while their indoor center fountain splashes you throughout your meal, they have good foods so I'll be back.

As a bonafide half mexican-american hahaa..I want 4 things from my carne asada 1.grilled charred taste  2.tenderness  3.a hint of citrus  4.proper accompaniments  America's carne asada is NOT the best carne asada in Phoenix, not even today, on National Taco Day.    No need for anyone to suffer the same disapponting let down, not to mention the total rip-off, that occurred tonight.  Spent $3.50 on a bottle of mexican Coke and $1.50 on a can of Coke.  $5.00 on drinks at a freaking taco shop is ridiculous.  I will say America's carne is tender and has the charred grilled taste, but that is where it ends, INCOMPLETE.  On a good tortilla, they serve their carne tacos with a stingy 1oz of salsa (not hot), grilled onions (wtf), guac, and lettuce (again wtf).  You have to douse it youself by squeezing the entire life out of your lime half, and even then it doesn't have enough flavor.  The meat is lacking its perfect marriage to sharper onion flavor,cilantro,hotter salsa.  That being said, don't go to America's, please.  Let the weirdos who think this place is the greatest support America's.  Oh and they also let people smoke on their patio...MMM smoke and weak carne in my mouth was tasty..nooot.  Trek about 7 miles north and you will find the best carne asada in Phoenix.  Funny how the restaurants that actually have the best carne asada in Phoenix are on the same street, yet are way out of the imaginary ballpark, of great carne asada that America thinks she is in.  Go to 7th Street & Mountain View.  Mountain View is just south of Peoria Ave.  Best carne asada street tacos = Tacos Jalisco (nw corner)  Best carne asada burrito = Vaqueros (sw corner behind CircleK) PERIOD

2nd visit - returned upon request of the gracious owner Terry.  Had a carne asada taco and bean burrito.    I have to say my vision of carne asada previously was narrow.  Down home carne asada from the streets was all I knew.  America's Taco Shop has broadened my carne asada horizons for the following reasons:  _Carne asada can have quality, proper cut, and flavor.  It can taste leaner, less greasy. _Refried beans can be free of lardo and theirs are some of the best I've ever had. _If you use a good tortilla to wrap their tacos and burritos, it's a sign you care. _While the expected accompaniments may not be present, who doesn't love caramelized onions and lettuce on a taco.  SO, lets take America's for what it is..a slightly upscale carne asada experience.    Yes, you will pay up more dough for less during this experience, but its one that needs to be had.  I will be back to America's because there will come a time when I want a more quality, lean, cleaner meal, which we all know you can't get on the "streets". _

The only way I can describe my experience is its as if your Nana or your friend's Nana cooked a homemade meal and you were lucky enough to be over that day.  -Homemade, perfectly salted, good textures, deep and spicy flavors, and HOMEMADE!  -I had the bowl of Chimaya Red Chile (PICTURED), in which you choose whether you want ground beef, chicken, or carne asada meat a lil different to have the option than the red chile with beef we are all used to.  I chose carne asada and it was greatness.  It came out with an extra large flour tortilla in a tortilla warmer just like at yo Nana's, good homemade pinto beans (not refried), thicker tomatoey tasty spanish rice, and the bowl of chile was bigger than my face and filled to the brim.  I swear it had to have had more than 2 cups in there.    -The best part was that the chile was perfectly seasoned, slightly smokey, slightly spicy and had the most meat I have ever seen in a red chile.  Aside from having such a great quantity of meat, the meat was so moist it tasted as if it had actually been in the chile for some time when we all know it hadn't been since they make the bowl to order.  -The man had the 2 taco combo.  You also have the choice of meat with this dish.  He also chose Carne Asada.  He said it was very tasty, moist carne asada in perfectly hand-fried shells.  He enjoyed the beans and rice as well so we have no idea wtf the previous reviewers were talking about the rice and beans being bland.  It was obvious the recipes used to concoct the rice/beans were Gil's own and again delicious at that.  -Chips are the thick, just-cut corn tortillas then fried to a perfect crispness and salted generously.  -Green salsa was okay but red salsa was thick and hotsaucy and had a very good spicy.  -Sopaipillas were perfect.  Light, airy, crisp outside, pillowy soft inside.  Served with a bowl of honey and YES a honey dipper (PICTURED) just like your Nana had in her kitchen for all those sopaipillas she made you.  I know 5 stars for one visit is a bit extreme but seriously every thing there is so homey tasting I am completely ignoring the fact that the atmosphere is lacking (think you are eating at Nana's and she's watching TV and only you and your friend are the only ones eating in the kitchen at 8pm haha), and the fact that they serve the 12oz bottles of Coke products for drinks..but you CAN BYOB I saw a couple walk in with their brown bags consisting of a Corona tall bottle and a premixed Margarita bottle.    ANYWAYs ignore what I just said in the last paragraph and only remember what I said about the food.    Please go here ONLY for the food and for the fact that I don't want this gem to close down from the lack of knowledge about this place's goodness before I have a chance to get back there!  GO here for the FOODS!

I love Lolo's Chicken & Waffles just as much as the next sheep but Off Da Hook Soul Food is where its at...NOW.  There's a new place that popped up on Glendale just east of 19th Ave which is a must go.  All Soul Food...All the Time...7 days a week in fact.  Get there asap..for a soul food experience you just might like more than Lolo's..Im just keeping it real because I think I rushed to this place because although Lolo's was my go-to spot, it was starting to become my have-to spot who occasionally gave me soggy waffles and fried chicken someone dropped the salt shaker in that day.  Note. I did not get to try the Mac & Cheese at Off Da Hook so that Lolo's still holds my top Macaroni and Cheese spot.  OK  Fried Chicken Wings: Moist, Crispy, Not Greasy (seriously, it was all crispy grease-free skin, weird but very pleasant), less salt-mo pepper seasoning which is what I meant by this is a whole notha chicken compared to what I am used to... but I am freakin in love with it  Fries: Good and with the all necessary seasoned salt  Corn Bread: Bread, not a muffin, but I can live with that as long as I can slather hot sauce or honey on it I'm good  Waffle: Extra Brown, Extra Crispy, Moist on the inside, and served with a modest amount (not a half cup) of whipped butter and some thick a** syrup in that pretty little glass syrup bottle.  Best waffle Ive ever had.  I always felt something missing from all the waffles Ive done before, but now I know the lasting brown crisp was what I have been missing because something needs to stand up to syrup.  Don't anyone come after me saying their waffle was burnt because just wait till your syrup lays all over that and you will know what it is I'm talking bout.  Kool-Aid: Kick you in the pants sweet, but with all that ice it all smooths out  Price: Average soul food prices $7.00 - $9.00 a plate $1.00 - $4.00 per side Great basket specials like 8 wings & fries for $10, or 2 wings & fries for $4 I think?   Atmosphere: Typical, but lotsa people for only being a week, and it was nice to bask in a restaurant stinking with the sweet spice smell of homemade sweet potato pie.  Service: Great service, waiter repeats all you ordered back to you, got my drinks to me within 5 minutes, food within 20 more minutes and totally-totally made up for the macaroni and cheese shortage.  4 stars for now...I wanted to do 5 but I didn't get to try more since my tummy can only handle so much goodness on one Friday night.  You will love it as an incredible change from the typical have-to spot.

Just not good.  Ordered 2 wings which came with 2 sides I chose macncheese and refried beans.  Wings were fried, slightly overcooked, and had no flavor.  No salty, no seasony, nothing.  Macncheese tasted a couple of elbow noodles swimming in warmed cream, with a tablespoon of actual cheese plopped in the cup.  Refried beans were soupy and slightly undercooked.  Also ordered a wing, drumstick thigh which came with 2 sides which were chosen as fries and corn on the cob.  The man agreed his chicken was also slightly overcooked, no salt, no seasony, nothing.   Fries were that cool spiral cut concept but were chewy, greasy and soggy.  Corn was corn haha.  I was hopeful that they would have a different style of fried chicken like at Pollo Campero.  Eek! Methinks not.  At the end of the meal, we came to the consensus they got everything they attempted wrong, absolutely wrong.  Im sad for them :( and sad for my $15.00 dollars.  I didnt even wanna write this review however I know this is exactly what Yelp is for.  I took one for the team tonight.  We win most and we lose some, I definitely lost tonight...

Seriously, undoubtedly GOOD.  Carne, Pastor, Pollo, Shrimp, Fish tacos or burritos or salads or taquitos you just cannot go wrong.      Tortillas, mexican hot dog, tortas, homemade salsas all above and beyond what you would expect.  Friendly owners with a story and a smile...all great.  This is not an average taco shop.  It is truly extraordinary.    ........Best Taco Shop in Phoenix. Period.

I couldn't quite pinpoint exactly what made my meal so above average...but definitely the flavor, quality, detail and great customer service tornado that I believe had me in awe of my good food stupor Good Fellas Grill put me in tonight.  I kept thinking of what that special something was after I had my meal here tonight... The only words that came out of my mouth tonight were: Mmm...sooo good...TASTY...mmm...sooo goooood ...Taasty  Lentil Soup = BEST soup ever... like  the best creamy chicken base with lentils pureed in.  free.  Chicken Potato Soup = ALSO ties for BEST soup ever.  A chicken-brothy soup with moist pieces of chicken and tender potato.  They are sure to give you some chili paste to mix in to only make a great soup even greater.  free.  Salad = romaine mix with chunks of tomato and cucumbers with what has to be their own recipe greek-tasting vinaigrette  Gyro Meat = moist with those perfect crispy edges, a little meat juice. Sandwich Pita = perfection in a pita, perfectly grilled possibly with butter for great flavor.  Yogurt sauce = just right thickness major dill  I will be back for this sauce.  It is definitely their own recipe and it is a major star.  Chicken Kabob = perfectly cooked, not overcooked, chunks of juicy chicken breast marinated in greek seasoning of some sort and lemon...think lemonpeppergreekseasoned.  Rice = again perfectly cooked, not overcooked, large bed of white rice.  They shove another little cup of chicken broth for you to swim your rice in because they think they know what is good... they truly do though... we took home the other 2 cups of rice left on the plate pured that chicken broth all over it and are dreaming today about eating it tomorrow.  That good.  Pistachio Bird's Nest = Light crispy phyllo with that good inner juiciness of syrup that pops in your mouth only when you bite into it.  Service = excellent son and father that made sure we had anything and everything we needed all with a friendly demeanor that is more often than not non-existent.  Go here... I love me some Greek Wraps but this place has it's own special charm and flavor.

Got the 12" regular hand-stretched crust with light cheese, pepperoni, half mushroom, half pineapple for 2 people for $13.00. WOW pleasantly surprised because you can talk up your natural goodness and high-quality all you want, but if it tastes like cardboard with healthy ish on it.. who gives a fudge?!?  Crispy flavorful crust Evenly distributed high-quality toppings Good sauce flavor and amount Best cheese I have had on takeout pizza stringy not congealed real mozzarella  Loved the clean flavors, cheap price, and quick 10 minute takeout.  let's go here and keep this business in the valley.  Don't let it slip through our fingers like the Churro Station did.  You will love it, you will not regret it.  Pleeease and thank you :))

Got the Chicken Boti, Garlic Nan, Riati sauce, Tzatziki sauce, and baklawa to go.  Chicken Boti consisted of perfectly spiced and marinated chunks of chicken breast served over a non-greasy flavorful basmati rice mixture.    Riati sauce was a cilantro-based lemony garlicky sauce that reminds me of chimichurri sauce.  Tzatziki sauce wa sthinner than expected but necessary to balance the spice and still very good.  Baklawa was juicy and crispy and with a certain strange pice that made it better than usual.  Service was awesome, the owners were very patient, helpful and descriptive since I have never had this type of cuisine before.   Got a question, just ask them, they wer every nice.  A quick 10 minutes after ordering, my food was ready to go.  Since everything was so tasty, I can't wait to go back and keep trying the different things on their long menu!  I am a sucker for meat grilled to perfection which is what they served to me here.
