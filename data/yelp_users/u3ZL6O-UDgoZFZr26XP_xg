Given that the last time I was here was five years ago - and it was packed with a line out the door - I assumed (which you should never do) that it would still be the same great place.  Unfortunately, we were one of three couples in the whole restaurant. Not letting that derail our evening, we ordered drinks and our go-to sushi favorites, which, also unfortunately, came out to be half the portion size we normally see at our preferred sushi spots and twice the price.   While the sushi was good, the lack of atmosphere, cost per sushi ratio and the mind-numbing smooth jazz they were playing made it the fastest dinner we ever had, and now a place we won't ever return. Sad to say given what it was in the past!

Haven't even been inside this place yet, but we moved to the Encanto area and with nothing in our fridge opted to order some pizza. Thinking it would take a while we called ahead to order take out, and they said it'd be ready in 10 minutes! Amazing for a place that I've heard so much about and figured would have a long wait.  The menu has some delish choices and the Tartufata pizza bianche is beyond amazing. As a picky pizza eater, this is now my new favorite place - and one that my fiance now prefers over the likes of Bianco's.   A MUST try if you haven't been.

Love this place! So much fun for karaoke, a great down-to-earth crowd that will sing along with you and a great selection of food that's better than your average bar/pub.  I highly recommend it for a low-key night out, kicking back with friends or singing along with strangers! :)

Been going here on and off for years (more regularly in the past year) and continue to return!   Been to various nail techs around town, in addition to resorts like Montelucia, and Ivy at VK still does a better job. The gels last 2-3 weeks, as do just regular polish on your toes, and her work is flawless! Not to mention the massage chairs...they are amazing.   Saw the negative reviews that were below and have never experienced anything like that here. They can get busy though so it's always better to make an appointment - with Ivy - when you can.

I've been going to Sumits Biltmore for over a month now and LOVE it. The studio is clean, gorgeous and always smells nice (not like bikram, how the carpet combined with everyone's sweat can make for a not so amazing odor).  It seems to be a much better workout than doing bikram, as it incorporates those poses, in addition to a power flow. The music is also a HUGE help, especially at those 5:30 a.m. classes, when you need a boost to get moving in the morning.   Would highly recommend it and for those just starting out, it's only $20 for 2 weeks so you can't beat that. I signed up for monthly unlimited, which also ended up being cheaper than the bikram studio I was at prior. Great place and I'd definitely check out Kim's classes - she's a great instructor!

Always have great time here! The staff are super friendly and the food and drinks are delish! Sundays are great for half-off bottles of wine and their guacamole is a must. For lunch I'd recommend The Frenchy with their sweet potato fries. Yum!

I'll start this off by saying I really wanted to like this restaurant. After hearing mixed reviews I kept an open mind, but unfortunately was dealt a mediocre experience.   The interior was cute, however you can tell that whoever chose the furniture didn't sit in each seat beforehand. We were at what could have been a cute little Italy type of table, but it was SO little that everyone's knees could not fit underneath it. Definitely more little kid than little Italy.    Another atmosphere downer was how HOT it was inside. Granted it was 116 degrees outside but the open kitchen layout wasn't helping Bianco's case - nor was the server who kept opening the patio door.   I will say the food was the best part of our experience, however it was mediocre Italian at best. The spaghetti...was spaghetti. I'd make it at home before coming back to order. The gnochhi was the best dish at the table and it was the corn that really made it. The cavatelli was decent (but I was glad I didn't order it) and our friend who ordered the pappardelle was apparently pleased because he ate it all.  If you're a Bianco fan, I'd say give it a go - maybe you'll get a better table, a less awkward server and food worth going back for; it just didn't happen on our visit.
