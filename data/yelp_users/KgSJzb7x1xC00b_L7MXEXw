I love this place!  Been coming here since 2000 when I moved here from Hawaii.  Whenever I need my comfort food I order the fried saimin. It's the best! But today I tried the hot wings and I'm upset I haven't ordered them before because they're so ono! A little sweet with some spiciness to it. And still crispy too.  I highly recommend!

Wanted to try something new so when I saw a Groupon at two for the price of one, I was thrilled.  I almost lost the promotional value though cause I waited till the last minute to book our reservation.  (Make sure you look at Groupon expiration dates). Anywho,  I took the opportunity to turn it into a date night with my hubby.  They had weekend dates available which fit our schedule perfectly. The place was easy to find and was located right off Chandler blvd. We had a group of twelve for our time slot and was considered a large group but everyone was cooperative which made the instructors job easier.  I was a bit nervous but after a few simple instructions, I was aiming and shooting at the target with no problem.  The instructor, Julie made it fun and competitive by adding balloons and zombies as target practice.  It was awesome! I'm proud to say I beat my hubby and had more head shots then he did.  It was an exciting way to spend an hour trying something new! Try it and see!!

The hubby suggested this place since he knows I love my Asian food and this was his first time trying Thai food. It was a cozy place and we were greeted as soon as we walked in however there was only one other family sitting in a booth.  We already knew what we were going to order since the menu was available online.  The food arrive quickly and our waitress was attentive and friendly. The food was good but nothing spectacular.  I'd go back again though and try the curry.

My daughter's girl scout troop saw The Adventures of Flat Stanley here today and it was awesome! The actors were all very lively and entertaining.  There were a lot of kids in the audience and and it seemed that their attention was kept throughout the whole performance.  Even a few adults were heard laughing out loud.   The music and choreography was perfect to tell the story of Flat Stanley for those who weren't familiar or didn't read the books (like myself). It also helped that we had the best seats in the house...Front Row!! I wish they'd have better food for the adults though since the matinee buffet was mostly geared toward kids. Mac and cheese,  chicken nuggets,  fries,  etc. However, I did have a good helping of Mac and cheese.  Overall,  my daughter and her troop had a great time so that's all that matters.  We were even able to take pictures and get autographs in their Flat Stanley books after the show.  The actors were so nice to the girls and some even stayed in character and chatted them up. The next kid themed show isn't until Christmas and it's more than likely we'll be back.  Maybe even sooner for a night out with the hubby!

This is my favorite hike ever! My first time doing this trail was brutal and that was over 5 years ago.  Now I'm in way better shape but this mountain still kicks my butt, in a good way of course. It also didn't help that the morning we went was right after the first monsoon of the season (July 4th) and the humidity was insane. The cloud cover did help with the heat though.   This was also my first time back since the renovations and I was overjoyed that we didn't have to wait in line to park. At 6am on a Friday (also holiday) morning,  there was still plenty of parking spaces available. Usually, I was used to getting there at 5:30 am with a line of cars waiting for the next available space to open up.  It would take 30 to 45 minutes to park.  I am so happy with the changes.   They also had a plaque displayed right before the trail got difficult warning hikers to know their limits and listen to their bodies. It shared the brief story about an experienced hiker who lost his life on the trail and stressed the importance of safety and the dangers of the trails. Awareness is crucial because my friend read that plaque and decided not to go further. She was happy at how far she had gotten. I'm glad she tried it but realized the top must wait for another day. Safety first!  Overall it was a great hike and reaching the top is such an awesome reward. The breeze was welcoming and the view is always epic. We like to spend some extra time up there reflecting, cooling down, and being thankful for our health and our lives.

I mostly come to Sonic for the slushies.  My kids love them especially in the summer and they're half off from 2pm to 4pm. However this Sonic managed to get my two drink order wrong.  I had to repeat my order more than 3 times and when I got to the window she had to confirm it yet again.  It was a blue raspberry with nerds (for my 6 year old) and a blue coconut for myself. After I received my order and drove away from the window I took a sip and realized she put nerds in mine as well.  It totally ruined the whole thing.  It was frustrating cause I couldn't go back and fix it because I had somewhere to be.  Wish there was one closer to my home cause I really don't want to go back to this one.

Every time I'm in the area I have to make a stop here.  I usually get the Mocha cappuccino milk tea with boba. I haven't ventured out to other flavors but they do have a big selection.  Lots of teas and fruit flavors. My 2 year old tried his first Boba today and he loved it!  I had to get him his own so he didn't drink mine.  I got him the vanilla milk tea.  I tasted it and it was good but not as good as mine! Love this place!  Fast service too!

I was really craving some Filipino and decided to give Jeepney a try. When i walked in there was a party going on and so there was little customer service at the counter. The food looked like it was sitting there all day and didn't look as appetizing. But i did drive out of my way to get there so I ordered a two item plate to go. The pork adobo was alright but not the best. I will not be going back.

My husband and I like to splurge every now and then on a good meal (preferably steak) so this year we decided to try Mastro's. I looked at previous reviews and saw that many people enjoyed it despite the price.  The hubby and I dressed up for our night out and expected everyone else to be as well.  But when we got there we noticed a few people wearing jeans,  Polo shirts,  and casual footwear. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  The dude who cleaned our table after each plate was taken was smiling as if he loved his job. I told him so as well.  He appreciated the compliment. For appetizers I ordered the oysters which were phenominal! I had them all to myself since the hubby is not a fan of them. The steak i ordered was the best I ever had!  I got the bone in cut and was very pleased with the flavor. I like a little fat on my steak. The lobster mashed potatoes was also great. We tried the butter cake but wasn't thrilled with it like other reviews. It was like eating hardened yellow cake. But overall we love, love,  loved our meal. If it wasn't so dang expensive I would go there every weekend.

I love coming here.  Being able to make my noodles the way I want is awesome plus the kids love it.  Very affordable too. It gets very busy around lunch time but the line moves fast.

Waited in the drive thru over ten min.  I'm actually writing this review while at the drive thru window.  Very slow. No apology or anything.

This review pertains to the service department only.  My radio/entertainment system all of a sudden died and I panicked. This is a fairly new car and not having my radio really makes driving unpleasant.  It's like the saying goes, you don't know what you've got till its gone.  Anywho,  I called the service department right away knowing that this should be covered under Hyundai's awesome warranty program.  I was able to get an appointment within the next 30 minutes which was wonderful! I hate waiting. I was out and about with my three babies so I was hoping that the process wouldn't take too long. I pulled up and was greeted immediately by a service rep.  I confirmed my name and appointment time. Another rep came a short time later and asked what was going on.  I told her what happened and she went to the back after taking some notes.  At this time my kiddies were getting a bit antsy. I was not looking forward to find out how long I needed to be there.  But she came back quickly with a mechanic and he inspected the problem. He left after about 3 minutes. She then approached me with her clipboard and I braced myself to hear some bad news.  She told me that the whole system needed to be replaced but that they needed to order the part which would take two days or so.  They would call me once it was in and the replacement would take a little over an hour.  She told me that usually they take the vehicle to the back to get inspected (which could take up to an hour) but seeing that I had my little ones with me, she took it upon herself to make the process as quick as possible since it wasn't a major repair.  I was so grateful for her thoughtfulness and thanked her several times. The entire appointment took about 15 minutes! And I know beforehand how long the next one will be so I can plan not to bring the little ones next time. Best experience ever at a dealer service department!

This was my first time here. Came for a lunch date over the weekend with a few friends. I wasn't really hungry since we'd just finish a movie (and a medium bag of popcorn) so I ordered from the appetizer section of the menu and got the calamari.    Now, my hubby and I have a thing where we always order calamari (if available on the menu) and if it blows us away then we know this is a place that we'd go to again.  Well, it didn't blow me away. Not one bit. The calamari was crispy but it was bland. There was nothing special about it. The sauce was even more disappointing. It tasted like mayo with some spices blended in. I know a lot of sauces are mayo based but this one tasted too much like mayo.    The service was okay. It was really busy due to the weekend crowd plus with all the soccer games going on.  Our server did the best he could do. He was friendly but nothing memorable about my experience other than my company of course.    I probably won't be coming back but it's worth a try. It is located in Tempe Marketplace so they're bound to get traffic no matter what. I'm just picky about my calamari.

Tried it for the first time on Mother's day.  We were greeted immediately at the door and was presented with a rose. It was a lovely surprise.  Since it was or first time we were shown the different sections of the restaurant and how it works.  As a family we chose the booth area.  The menu wasn't overwhelming and we ordered the brisket, wings,  and baked potato. The food and service was great.  Very friendly.  One of the cooks was even passing out hot towels for our bbq'd face and hands. I loved that the table was lined in paper so the kids can color and draw while they waited and ate their food. Great decor and atmosphere.  The seating outside was very cute with boats but it was too windy that day to be outside.

Not very Asian if you ask me.  The food was greasy and salty even for mall food. Most of it was soggy and the vegetables didn't even have a crunch or crisp to them. The 2 entrée plate was not worth the $7.00 paid.  Even my kids did not want to eat it and they love Panda Express.  This place, however does not even come close in comparison. I'm sad that after the remodel, they did not return.  I will not eat here ever again.  If I wanted grease I should have gone to Church's Chicken a few spots over.

This was my first visit after about a year of wanting to try it out. It was very easy to find since it was really close to one of my favorite restaurants, Aloha kitchen.  The hubby and I went on a Saturday around 430. There was about a 30 min wait but we passed the time at the bar with a drink or two. The smell from the restaurant was amazing. Growing up in Hawaii, I developed a love for seafood and I was so excited to finally have some crab legs and oysters. The hostess and waiters were very friendly and greeted us when we walked in and as we were seated. The waiter went over any questions we had with the menu and was very patient even though the place was very busy. I ordered a half dozen oysters and crab legs, and the hubby chose the calamari and shrimp basket. The food arrived faster than I expected which was great because I was starving!  And boy, was it delicious! I tore into that crab and oysters so fast. My belly was very happy. The fries were seasoned just right along with everything else. The hubby enjoyed his food too and although he's not into "raw"seafood, he did try an oyster. It was hilarious.  The angry crab gets 5 stars from me! I love the atmosphere, food,  and pricing. For all that we ordered plus drinks, we spent about $60 total. That's an A+ in the Eley book and we will be back soon!

I love coming to this nail salon.  I used to go to another one nearby but the service is not as good as this place.  They are very friendly and do a great job on my nails! They take the time and do it right and at great prices too! Plus they are open till 7 pm which is good for those who work all day.  I highly recommended Blue Sky!
