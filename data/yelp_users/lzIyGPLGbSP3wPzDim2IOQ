Always a great time! Food is good and everyone is fun. If you don't want to have fun, you can try Panda Express and be boring.

So we ended up here in an effort to try something different in the area. Once we sat down I decided to look up on Yelp to see the reviews. Probably should have done that first.   After reading several terrible reviews I thought, well it's too late, let's hope they were wrong.  Not a chance!  My 6 yr old daughter ordered a PB&J early hoping she could eat while we waited for our food. It didn't come out until the rest of our food. It was so bad, it didn't even look like a sandwich. My daughter said after 2 bites "I don't want to eat here again". That's a 6 yr old!  Our food came out Luke warm and looking like a science project. We really couldn't eat much of it at all.  The waiter, who was nice, asked if we were all good. I said "no, this is horrible" and asked for our check. He was nice enough to take the PB&J off since my daughter really didn't eat any of it.  In addition to the awful food, there were flys all over the place which was a complete bother during what seemed like a longer than necessary wait given how busy the place was and how little we ordered.  I will never be coming back!

When you think of Mandalay Bay, you think high end. Lots of great restaurants, shops, etc.. So when we were in a hurry and wanted a buffet near by, we chose here.   I always regret not looking at Yelp first, but there is no way that a nice upscale hotel like this would have a bad buffet, right? WRONG!  The place was about 2/3 full, yet we waited for at least 15 min to be seated. The food selection was minimal, and you could tell that it wasn't turning regularly as many of the dishes looked over cooked, and old. As expected, taste was the same. Cold once out from under the heat lamp, soggy, or hard.   With such a small amount of choices, you would think that it would be easy to keep the name tags in front of the proper food, but most items had the wrong tags and many had none at all.  The short of it is don't eat here. Go to one of the other restaurants at Mandalay, or if you want a buffet, find a different one down the strip. Very strong chance any of them will be better.

The food was fine, but the service was so slow and the entire staff ignored us as we sat there for 30 min trying to get our bill

The closest thing you can get to being in Chicago! Great Italian Beef, very good service and people that care. If you want an Italian Beef, Burger, or Hot Dog, then make your way here. Oh yea, and the fries with fry sauce were awesome as well!

They are no help at all! Drove 10 miles to be told they would deliver a package without signature only to come home to a tag saying nobody there to sign. Now 10 miles back to pick it up.

I really want to like this place.  I have several friends that told me about it.  They have a good vibe, and an interesting menu, but unfortunately after 2 bad visits in 1 week I won't be returning.  I went with the family last weekend and had a great waiter, but the food was just so so.  The drink wasn't good, and the burger was well done instead of medium.  They gave me a free drink, and the manager came over on the burger.  I told her it was just feedback on the burger and I didn't want to make a big deal about it even though it was burnt.  I went back last night with the family.  My daughters Mac and Cheese came out in less than 5 minutes.  It was salty, and tasted bad.  If a 7 year old who eats Mac and Cheese at least 4 times a week doesn't like it, then it has to be bad.  Then we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after we reminded the waiter, and the whole time we were out of water.  Our appetizer, tempura zucchini,  was more like beer battered and the zucchini was too thick and under cooked.  The Southwest Aioli looked like it had a crust on the top, and liquid floating, plus it was hot.  Not good for a mayonaise based product.  Ordered a chicken dinner to split.  It was burnt on the outside and pink on the inside.  It sat in a bowl of mush which tasted horribly.  We didn't eat hardly any of it, and told the waiter who didn't acknowledge the problem, but did go show the manager which happened to be the same woman that we spoke with the last time we were in.  Instead of her coming over and talking to us, they just took the meal off.  I appreciate that they have not charged us for some of our items that were screwed up, but there seems to be little concern for the customer.  They need to fire the chef, fire the expediter, inspect their wait staff for consistency in quality of service, and inspect what their customer experience is all about.   We eat out every day and are always looking for good places.  This place has potential, but it's being managed poorly.

2nd time here in a row for the UFC fights. Sitting on the patio with 3 girls working, and not a single one asks if they can get me a drink in almost 2 hours. I'm use to a $100 bar bill when I go watch the fights, but now I just drink before I come and don't have to worry about them taking any of my money.

2ND TIME IN A ROW. Same experience!  The property is fine, no real issues other then water that is so soft it makes you feel slimy when you're taking a shower, and the walls are very thin. You can hear everything next to you and down the hall.   The biggest issue is that everyone is incompetent. Valet, no attendant. Check in process, slow and the people don't listen. If you happen to need something, like your room made up, or your sink fixed, don't expect anyone to follow through. And if you have other issues, as we did, don't expect the management to resolve them, but they will say they are sorry.  Lastly, nothing makes me want to buy a Hilton timeshare more, then getting a phone call solicitation at 8am, and then another one at 9am after you already told them no, and you went to bed at 4am.

Not very good. 25 min wait for what should be somewhat fast food. The flavors were not very good on any of the 4 items we had. I'd suggest they reevaluate the menu and then figure out how to be more efficient. People will forgive slow service for good food, but this place is a bust on all fronts.

This is our first time here. Great food, great service, and great prices! So good that we decided to bring friends back here for dinner the same day.

Great service and extremely reasonable. There is no better place to go in AZ for aftermarket work on Audi's, VW, or BMW.

Terribly slow service. 15 min for a sandwich and nobody else was in front of me. This is an airport, yet the restaurant has faster service. This is the 2nd time, and last time!

If you want to stare at cute college girls, you picked the right place! If you want good food or service, drive to Scottsdale or Las Vegas. 3 attempts and all we experienced was long waits, cold food, and bad service. As someone who loves the fox franchise, it's sad that their name is on this location.
