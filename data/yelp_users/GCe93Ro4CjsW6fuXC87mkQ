I found this place due to Yelp. While we have been to the Phoenix metro area many times having lived in Tucson for many years, we recently moved to Chandler and don't know all of the great places to eat yet.  I was in the area running some errands and brought Yelp up on my Iphone to find a decent gyro.    Ordered 2 of their basic gyros to go and went back to my office.  Not only did I really enjoy it, all of my co-workers asked where I went and said that they smelled amazing. If I would have been a nice guy, I should have shared, but I was hungry. :-)  Niro's will become a regular stop on our lunch circuit.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other items on their menu.

This is a regular lunch spot for me and my co-workers.  If you go in at lunch time, you will see that it is a regular place for a lot of people.  It can get very busy, but the staff does a great job of providing top notch service even when packed.  I am not an expert on Thai food, but I have not tried anything there that wasn't outstanding.  It is really hard to come up with a favorite, just try any of the lunch specials and you can't go wrong.  One word of warning, they let you pick your level of spiciness, and I find that if you are sensitive to spicy food, you might want to be a bit conservative.

Ted's has the best hotdogs in Arizona, bar none.  The line at lunch can be a little long, but it is worth the wait.    You can't go wrong with a jumbo all beef and an order of onion rings.

We recently moved to Chandler from Tucson and happen to be very close to Venezia's.  Our first couple nights in the new house were hectic and we hadn't unpacked any of our kitchen stuff, so we were looking for something that could be delivered.  Venezia's was the first thing that came up on my Iphone Yelp app so we gave it a try.  Nothing exciting, just your standard pepperoni pizza.  The price was good, and even better, the pizza was quite good.  The next night we tried some of their winds and other items and were equally happy with them.  Venezia's will be our "go to" pizza place here at the new house, which is saying something, we never had that in Tucson.

We had plans in the area last night, so we wanted to find somewhere for dinner.  After searching through reviews of the different places in the neighborhood, we decided to give Fez a try.  We were a little worried when we arrived and the parking lot was full, we expected there to be a wait, especially on a Saturday night, but we were able to walk right in.  The service staff was very friendly.  I agree with what has been mentioned about the demographic that is there, we were the only non-same sex couple in the place. :-)  After reading so many reviews, I had to try the Fez Burger and their sweet potatoe fries.  Both were outstanding, and I felt that the prices were actually on the lower side of what I would have expected to pay for the meal I enjoyed.    The place is nice looking, but the atmosphere is very comfortable, and as I said, the staff is very friendly.  We will certainly be going back.

We have been to San Tan a few times now.  The food is better than most when it comes to "bar" type food, and I always enjoy trying different micro-brews.  For me, their Pale Ale is the highlight. Nice and hoppy, just as a Pale should be.

We have been meaning to stop by Chili Billy's since moving to Chandler from Tucson a couple years ago.  Of course every time we think about it, it is already after their 7:00pm closing time.  We managed to sneak in tonight just before closing and am thrilled that we did.  The burgers were great and they have really good frys.  I didn't try the hot dogs, even through they get rave reviews here, as they were listed as being Hebrew Nationals and I can make those at home.  Parking is a bit of a challenge, but not really that bad.  I would highly recommend stopping by.  Of course we just discovered the place and are in the process of moving out of state.  Just my luck.

I had to break the trend of decent reviews for DC Steak House, I really did want to like it.  Downtown Chandler has needed a place like this and we had really high hopes for it.  They bill themselves as being between the lower end and the higher end steak houses and they nailed it when it comes to the final bill, sadly they didn't when it comes to the food.  I honestly believe that this is the first steak house I have ever been to that would not let me substitute out the side house salad for a side ceaser salad.  The waiter told me that he could get fired if he asked the kitchen to do that for me.  Even the lower end places allow that.  When it came to the steak, I ordered the $31 fillet which was probably a decent cut of meat, but my definition of medium rare and their definition seems to be very different.  There was no way that my steak was anything other than medium well.  I wouldn't mind paying something higher than what I can get at the national chain places if I actually had a meal that was better than what I can get at those same chains.
