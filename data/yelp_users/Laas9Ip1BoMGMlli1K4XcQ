Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; "white meat chicken" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service.

I bought Groupons for Unicorn Balloon Company to help my mother fulfill one of the items on her "bucket list". I was a bit worried, as I had read a less-than-stellar review, but ultimately, I was impressed by the professionalism of this company. We had no problems using the Groupons and making the reservations a few months in advance. We met the van at the designated time, and they took us to the launch site, checking the air currents for the best launch site. They allowed non-riders to follow to the site, as well.  Our pilot, Capt. John Bagwell, was very knowledgeable and personable, telling humorous stories interspersed with ballooning facts. He also took video of the flight, which will be available via e-mail at no extra cost - something most ballooning companies do not do. Our flight lasted about 1 1/2 hrs., and apparently our chase truck had a flat tire, so was a bit late getting to the landing site (though others in view did not). We did tip on landing, but at the current windspeed, that was to be expected, and the pilot warned us that it would happen. (Note re: previous reviewer: the chase crew does not "help you land".) We had a champagne toast and continental breakfast as they presented certificates. A very nice morning, indeed!

Stopped in yesterday for a late lunch and a drink - had not been here before. Was glad to see that they had happy hour specials going on, so ordered the chicken lettuce wraps off the HH menu. Bartender was friendly and accommodating and order came out quickly. However, it had NO TASTE WHATSOEVER. Tried to spice it up a little with the bland peanut sauce and hoped the mango salad would enliven it, as well, but it was not to be. Glad I had a magazine with me, b/c there was no one to chat with at the bar...and tables seemed to be filled with the geriatric crowd. If I had any grandparents left, this is where I would take them.

It's been how many months, and the A/C still isn't fixed?! Major fail! Nice looking place...just need to get their act together!

Stopped here on First Friday and was happily surprised to get a seat, along with my date. Even more happily surprised to see Tobin James, Turley, and other good wines on the specials board at decent prices. The place got a bit loud as it filled up - maybe some artwork on the walls would help the atmosphere a bit - but overall, liked the feel. Reminded me of some of the renovated house/bars back in Baltimore. Food is upscale comfort food. He got the artery-clogging fried bologna sandwich, while I got the grilled beef w/cheese and onions (probably just as artery-clogging). Spicy marinated asparagus was a unique touch. Watched a bit of an old Clint Eastwood flick ont he large TV over the bar, as well. Much better than having mindless sporting events on. Will definitely be back on a less-crowded night.

I've been here for brunch or a glass of wine on numerous occasions and always have a pleasant experience. This time was no exception. I hosted 25 members of my wine group, VinVillage-Phoneix, here as the first stop on a wine bar crawl. They were expecting us, and I arrived a few minutes early to make sure tables were reserved, etc. I ordered a glass of champagne, and since they were out of the Gloria Ferrer, the substituted a nicer Mumm...extra points for that. The group arrived and began ordering wine and food. Heather, the lone waitress, kept her cool as everyone asked for separate checks. She really did an awesome job keeping things moving from the kitchen to the dining room and keeping our glasses filled. (She also had several other customers at the bar and in the middle room by the breakfast counter.)  I heard quite a few positive comments about the thin-crusted pizza. One gentleman's roast beef panini looked scrumptious. I got the "garbage" salad, with ham, chicken, Parmesan, avocado, olives, etc. over a variety of leafy greens. Maybe not the most appetizing mixture to look at, but it tasted so good I ate every last bite.  Klinker Brick Zin seemed to be the favorite wine here. One couple was elated that they had their favorite hard-to-find blend, and so ordered a bottle of it to share.  Still have not been to a concert here in the back, but have caught an acoustic guitar player occasionally. Nice atmosphere, very laid back.

This park is very convenient to my house, which is the main reason I come here quite often. There are several different trails you can take, depending on how much of a workout you want (or, in my case, how hungover you are). Yes, it does get crowded and parking in the NW lot can be difficult, especially on the weekends, so go early, by about 7 am. I do think the trails are nicer since they have been widened, but show a little trail etiquette: just because the trail is wider does not mean you get to hike 3 or 4 abreast! Take a look at the trail maps to see which ones are loops and which ones are not. I didn't do this one time and wound up somewhere out on 55th Ave - my 3 mile hike turned into an 8-miler through the scenic Arrowhead community. And, contrary to other Yelpers, I do like when people say hello. Don't do it, and you may hear me whisper "Bitch" under my breath as you pass by!

OMG - If I were going to have a restaurant, this is how I would do the food! The atmosphere could be a little warmer, but I liked chatting with the chef at the open kitchen, and the waiter was more than friendly. The food is particular/precise without being fussy. That said, if you are more about quantity than quality, this might not be the place for you. I started with an amuse-bouche of pickled grapes with finely chopped chorizo and chive - sounds like an odd combo, but it worked. The chilled corn soup was poured tableside over the garnishes revealed in the bowl once the elegant lid was whisked away. The intense corn flavor and velvety texture was amazing! I followed this with handmade ravioli with a combination of tangy soft cheeses, sprinkled with a little banyuls and shreds of a harder, smokier cojita. Whenever I've had/made fresh pasta, I can't tell you how hard it is to go back to the dried, boxed stuff! Not sure what al dente should feel like? Try this and you'll know. I hadn't planned on dessert (especially since with a glass of wine, this was becoming pricey for a Wednesday dinner), but then they brought out a sweet intermezzo (I won't spoil the surprise for those who haven't been there yet), followed by a scoop of coconut sorbet melting into a hazelnut dacquios, drizzled with a brilliant sunset-hued mango curd, then topped with thin pieces of meringue. Wow! They need to bottle and sell the tangy mango curd - it was out of this world. Before they rolled me out into the parking lot, they tucked a parting gift by my purse - a neatly-wrapped wedge of buttery chocolate chip shortbread - as if I needed any additional encouragement to come back!

Hosted a VinVillage event here last week, and it was awesome! Had to break the group of 20 into 2 tables, but I was glad they could accommodate more than the 12 I had initially booked. (Yes, I called a couple days ahead to let them know.) We started with an amuse-buche, but were quickly on to the main courses. A steak salad was cooked perfectly for everyon'es liking. The hand-rolled pasta in lemon cream sauce with peas and proscuitto was fabulous, though I threatened to stab anyone who came close "just to try some" as taking 1 pasta tube would have been 20% of my meal! I also enjoyed the salad of zucchini and yellow watermelon with almonds. But the bomb was the bombe - a cherry and chocolate concoction that was to die for! Others got the doughnuts and raved about them and the accompanying dipping sauces, as well. Wine was very good, as it has been in the past, and several ordered a port to go with dessert. Service was on point - refolded napkins, quickly cleared plates, casual yet respectful service from knowledgeable waitstaff. (One server actually whisked my paper-wrapped used gum out of my hand before I could discreetly dispose of it in my purse.) Kudos, once again to Chef Chris, as well!

This was the second stop on our (VinVillage-Phoenix) little wine jaunt through Cave Creek this weekend. The $5/glass happy hour special was a steal. Or if you prefer, get a bottle to share, which several of us did. They have an amazing selection, all handpicked (and probably verified) by the owners. Nancy wasn't there, though I have talked with her before, and she is great - but Bryan kept things moving along for us. Nice interior decor, with some sofa areas and western-themed barstools, and also a quiet patio. Easy to miss if you don't know it's in Stagecoach Village off Cave Creek Road. The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is that they do not serve food - though they will order it from a sub shop across the way (but that doesn't really complement the wine, now does it?).

Set up a VinVillage event at this place, sight unseen, which I hosted last night. After the glowing descriptions on their website, some of the reviews here, and knowing they are located at CityNorth, I expected much better!   Walking in, I did not get the feeling of "upscale" restaurant. Sports on 2 TVs blaring out over the bar and into the open dining room did nothing for the atmosphere. They had a long table pulled together for our group in the center of the room, but I grabbed a seat at the bar since I was the first to arrive. Took a few minutes, but the bartender eventually gave me a wine list/menu, answered my questions, and proceeded to get my drink. They had a good selection of wines, and some you don't normally find on wine lists at every other place in town.  A few others came in and we moved to the table, no problem transferring tabs. Seemed to take a long time between everyone (about 15 of us, though we initially expected 20) receiving their drinks and the time the first apps came out. Granted, they were complimentary (the deal I worked out for my group), and they were quite yummy - especially the spicy tuna on tempura eggplant - so once we started eating, we forgot about the wait. The pate was very rich and served with soft slices of raisin bread. Some were immediately addicted to the bacon-wrapped dates.  Everyone ordered a burger of one type or another, some opting for the pre-selected toppings, other customizing and adding sweet potato fries. We confirmed that everyone was on separate checks. My burger came out not quite as rare as I would have liked, but what do you expect when the patty is only 1/2" thick? I am not a big beef fan, anyway. Sauces were good, especially the pungent garlic parm, as were the fries.  But then, we waited for the checks...and waited...and waited. Seems the staff didn't begin trying to sort out who had what until at least HALF AN HOUR AFTER everyone had finished eating and plates had been cleared! And none clearly knew how to use the POS system. Those who had cash eventually tired of waiting and just left it on the table. Those of us with credit cards were not so lucky...and several bills had to be re-rung, as they did not include the right items.   I had wanted to go back to try the salted caramel milkshake, but it will be a long time before I return.

I have been trying various salons lately and haven't really been happy with any of them. Then I tried a groupon-type promotion for Ann Hughes at J Salon. A bit out of my area, but she did the best job on my hair, giving it layers, movement, and a bit of curl when it's usually pin-straight. Proud to call Ann my new stylist.

Perhaps I spoke too soon! While I was able to overlook the almost hour wait after my confirmed appointment time the first time because she did such a good job, I call three strikes and you're out. On my second visit, Anne called me an hour before my confirmed appointment time, asking me to come earlier, and she was not very nice about it, though I was doing her a favor. I was able to get there 15 minutes earlier, which apparently was not enough for her. Then, she did a quick job on my hair, no curl whatsoever. The third time, she called a half hour before my confirmed appointment time and asked me to delay it for half an hour. I was not happy - apparently, her time is more valuable than mine, and it is more important to squeeze in a client without an appointment than to keep another client's confirmed appointment. This time, she rushed me through even more. My hair was barely trimmed and the styling was horrid. I still had soap bubbles in my ears when I left. Never again! Search is back on...

I have used this plumbing company twice now. Each time, the serviceman was prompt and courteous, getting to the problem at hand and explaining everything to me that he was fixing. He showed me how to clean the line so that I did not need to make calls in the future. He also checked but did not fix/overcharge for things that really did not need to be done when correcting things on an inspection report pre-house sale. Prices were more than reasonable. I will not use another company!

I really wanted to like this place, and the pictures of their fresh salads on their website looked enticing. So got a group of my co-workers to go for a "healthy" lunch. Many of us ordered the combo - which I thought was a half sandwich and a cup of soup - like it is at most places. Instead, it was a whole sandwich and bowl of soup. So much for the healthier smaller portions. Soups were salty. Thai lobster curry did not have a shred of lobster meat in it. Lunch meats used in the sandwiches were cheap and relatively tasteless. One in our group got a salad that "tasted like fish" but contained no seafood. They happily exchanged it, though.  But the thing that really chapped my butt was a salesperson who approached our table mid-meal and tried to sell us Silpada jewelry and have us book a party. Apparently, management at this establishment allows that to happen, as she and another salesperson had set up their "home base" at a table at the front of the store, with catalogs and gift bags. Let me assure you, when I am out lunching with co-workers under a time limit, I am there to enjoy their company. The last thing I want is to be accosted by a sales presentation! I tried to complain through Zupa's website, but they have no Contact link there for message. Wonder why?  Thank God I didn't see the review here about the cockroach in the salad until after we got back. No need to ever go again.

We went here for happy hour a couple weeks ago, but before I could even write a review, they were closed! Yep, as of June 2013 - CLOSED!

After numerous fiascos at the dealership across the street, I took my little car here for some TLC. They found the root cause of the issue (which I still contend was initially  caused by the dealership), fixed it quickly and at a reasonable price. Had another (different) issue a couple months later - same story: quick and efficient. Highly recommend Wilhelm's. Will continue to take my car here. They even gave me a ride to/from work.

Looking for a little neighborhood bar, we checked this place out a couple times. Friendly staff, nice small crowd of regulars at the bar. Food was just meh - mostly small, dry, overcooked items (at least on the HH menu). But the last time I was there, I felt a tickle and nearly lost it as I flicked a cockroach off my arm! It scurried across the bar and dropped off behind it. It may have gone into the ice. The bartender looked around, but then just shrugged. No apology, no comp. Like I said, that will be my last time!

Initially, I really liked OTF. Some of the trainers are great and really motivate you, and I liked the group setting. But after going for two months, some issues I've had with my elbows began to re-emerge and it was difficult to change up the weights and other exercises to accommodate them. I did, however, want to continue using my heart monitor outside doing my regular running/hiking activities, so planned to switch to a smaller package. And then, I got an email that their already exorbitant prices were going UP! Although they require 30 days to process a cancellation, I was not given 30 days to change my package. I requested the new rates, which they didn't have printed, and was told several different things by various people, ending in me cancelling because they had limited their 10-session package to 3 months when it was previously for a year! (I have since learned that this has changed again, thanks to some other irate customers.) My renewal was 3/4, but they refused to downgrade my package on 3/1 - said I had missed their deadline by a day, when I had already spoken to them about it. Numerous phone calls have resulted in no answers, lost paperwork, a manager who said she had to talk to HQ and has yet to return my call after almost a week...you get the picture...and still the extra charge is on my credit card. Oh, and after being told that their late cancel policy was once/month for members with my package, they suddenly charged me without notice on my only "violation" in Feb. No email or other notice, though after the fact, a copy of the new policy appeared on their front desk...if you happened to see it. (They said it goes to charity, which I might believe if they'd given me a tax form.) I have disputed the charge on my credit card and am reporting them to the Better Business Bureau. Stay away!
