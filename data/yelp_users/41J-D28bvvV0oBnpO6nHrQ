Had a water, and possible mold emergency on Friday night, I called them very early Saturday morning explaining the situation, and after four days, I still haven't got a call back from their project manager to set up a time for them to come out.  I'm going with another company.  I wish they'd told me 4 days ago they were too busy to come.

Nice place.  We "pricelined" a room for $60, so we probably didn't get the absolute BEST room, but it was nice.  Fast checkin.  Excellent clerk.  We mentioned it was our 2nd anniversary and she gave us 2 drink coupons.  We only stayed one night, so didn't really get to check out everything, but overall, I can't complain.  Don't forget your shower cap, because there wasn't one in the room.    There were wild bunny rabbits right outside our patio.

Discovered my tire was FLAT.  Got enough air in it to drive it to Discount Tire on 44th and Bell.  I was LATE for work!  They were BUSY and their computers were down!  They said it would take about an hour.    About an hour later, they were all done!   They checked ALL my tires, discovered they were all loose, and they fixed the one (it had a nail in it) and I was on my way!     The technicians were extremely nice and were even singing as they worked.  AND they didn't even charge me ANYTHING for the great service!   Discount Tire...2 thumbs up!

Trying to decide where to pick up dinner for my family, I decided to try this place, based on the great Yelp reviews.   I went to their website, and placed my order to be picked up at 6 p.m.   I ALMOST chose to pay by credit card online, SO glad I chose 'cash' instead because when I GOT there at 6:00,...the store was full of workers who were completely REMODELING the store, and they looked at me like I was nutz.   Ended up going to Pong Pong chinese (also based on my Yelp research), had to wait a LONG time (since I didn't have time to pre-order it), but it was VERY good food.   I guess I'll have to wait to try Mr. Goodcents.  I wish they'd noted on their website that they'd be closed for remodeling.

I ate once at their old location and it was marvelous...and today we went to the new location.   The wait to get seating (table of 6) was about 25 minutes, but once inside, it was perfect.    It only took 15 minutes for all of us to be served and the food was amazing.   We all had to roll ourselves out the door.   Coffee was refilled very often.  The 6 of us fit cozily into a high-back booth, but it was okay.   The servers worked their butts off.    Fantastic biscuits (beware, they're BIG) and gravy, and my waffle with blueberry syrup was heavenly.   We went on a Saturday morning 11:00 ish.

Had to return a large area rug.  When I cam in, the clerk, Ben, was on the phone with technical support because their computer was having issues.  I told him go ahead and finish, but he said he'd be a while and proceeded to wait on me.   Every few seconds the guy on the phone would tell him something and he'd have to run over to the computer, etc etc. this went on for a long time.  The line behind me started to form.   Then the UPS man showed up at the back door.  Then the phone started ringing.   Ben was there alone.  He handled it like a pro, he was calm, proficient, and never cracked.   He got my order done in time to get on the truck and answered several questions I had.   Ben can juggle 5 things at once with style.   I was impressed.   Ben rocks.
