You don't want to live here. When I moved in 2 years ago everything was great including the maintenance service. if there was any issue you just called the management office and someone would be there to fix it in no time. However, over the last year things have taken a major turn for the worse. By their own admission they lost a great part of their maintenance crew and this has moved the service from superior to inferior.  Case in point, I have had a broken closet for over 3 months now. I have been super nice in asking for it to be fixed at least half a dozen times but no one seems interested in helping. I keep being told that "I'm at the top of the list," but nothing happens.  Of course this is a minor issue compared to other more potentially annoying/dangerous problems that can take place but it points to the major issue at hand. They just don't do a good job anymore. This is an apartment complex on the decline. If you are interested in renting here do a closer look. You'll see the issues. Ask around. Knock on some doors. it will be worth the effort. I believe all this might be do to an ownership and/or management change but it's hard to get answers from the unwelcoming/unhelpful and often clueless office staff. In their defense I can tell that they are just cogs in a broken machine and really powerless but the lack of forthrightness is just wrong. There are many, many living choices in Scottsdale. Don't waste good money by picking San Antigua.

I go here at least once a month. They have an excellent membership package and good prices in general. Emily rocks! I highly suggest asking for her.

This is by far the best flower company I have ever dealt with. Each days arrangement is well thought out and beautiful. Service is speedy and customer service responsive. I have used MLP several times and they have been right on each time. And all this for $30. I will continue to be a loyal customer because they have earned it!!
