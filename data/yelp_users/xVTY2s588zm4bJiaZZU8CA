all the naysayers seem have a bone to pick, the service here is incredible and the food is better.  vegan options as well and staff that helps make sure your order has no egg or fish sauce.  if your looking for thai, this is the best place in the valley we have been to, and being vegan, we have been to too many to count

Having read all of the previous reviews, including one from less than a week ago, I felt a little skeptical about attending the Buddy Guy concert last night...well, I am sure glad I ignored all the bad reviews.  This place is great for a show! Old converted warehouse with great sound, good lighting, even our seats with a post in our line of sight were great seats. It may have helped that Buddy Guy put on an amazing show, but the temperature of the place was nice, the staff was friendly, we got right in, grabbed a drink at one of the three enormous bars and grabbed a couple of seats off to the side of the stage where we were promptly greeted by a waitress.    I can see why the VIP section might be a little frustrating (most people end up standing on the railing which forces you to either watch on a TV or get up yourself, thus defeating the purpose of the nice couches), but other than that, I highly recommend this venue for a show.  I would go so far as to say that if you are in the mood for live music, you should check the lineup here before anywhere else.  we will definitely go back, maybe I will even take my wife to see Blondie...

Sens was our favorite restaurant in Phoenix, so naturally we were excited to try this new creation.  Unfortunately we had one of the worst service experiences we have ever had, we didnt even get to try the menu.  The bartenders were nothing short of terrible, unsociable, handled a busy bar as if they had never tended before, and actually got mad at patrons for requesting drinks.  We were told we would be sat next, however, after 60 minutes of waiting and two groups were sat ahead of us, we decided it was time to leave.   fortunately, we will be back, becuase we really do want to love this place as much as Sens, I just hope they get their sh*t together by the time we go back.

Thankfully the poor service we experienced shortly after this place opened seems to have been addressed.  We have been back twice since and both times were fantastic.  a little bit slow, but with the atmosphere and music that plays, we didnt mind taking our time to enjoy the wonderful food that is served here.  I am happy to report that while we miss Sens, we very much enjoy Sochu and will go back again!
