I can see why this place has such high ratings.  The staff were really nice, the service was outstanding.  I didn't find it slow at all, especially since what you are waiting for is fresh food.  The interior was spacious.  There were gentlemen playing guitars in the corner. The prices were good, particularly considering how much food you get.  I ended up taking more than half of my food home.   The food was delicious!  The two kinds of salsa were both fresh and delicious.  The red was my favorite of the two because of its smoky flavor.  They make their chips on the spot when you order them, so they were hot and crunchy.  I ordered the machaca. I had never had it before and it was phenomenal.  I also ordered the green chile, which I expected to be spicier since it had an * warning, but I could have handled a little more heat to the dish.  I can only imagine what they put in the refried beans to make them so good, my arteries probably should not inquire.  They serve homemade tortillas, hot and fresh.  They can bury me in one like a shroud one day.   I will definitely go back to try other things.

I come back here again and again, and not just because it's close to where I work while in Phoenix.  The thing that keeps me coming back is the consistency.  The food has never let me down, the turkey sandwich is my go to.  I really like their potato salad.  The customer service is always friendly and fast.  And the peanut butter cup cookie is a dangerously delicious thing to behold.

This place is a fun little diversion.  Quirky with a whimsical backstory that is both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.  Cash only entrance fee for a detailed tour by some lovely people that takes about thirty minutes.  They do the tour in english and spanish.  They close for several months out of the year.

Usually my stop before heading into my account if I am working the night shift.  The food is a'ight.  I usually just get a bean and cheese burrito and often find that the cheese isn't melted.  Which is crazy that it isn't warmer considered how long the wait is.

I came in for a underarm wax and a pedicure and both were fine.  I obviously didn't have the experience that the low raters had.   The woman who did my wax was very nice.  She was efficient and did a good job, while not painless because it is a wax, it was not any more uncomfortable than necessary.   The pedicure was good.  The leg and foot massage was lovely.  The polish seems a little watered down so I don't think that will last particularly long, but I'm okay with that.   The people who work here are all very nice and I had a nice conversation with the owner while I waited for my nails to dry.

Fun mom and pop breakfast joint with old-school Mel's Diner charm.  Huge menu.  All of the carb-laden, glucose spiking breakfast goodness that one craves.  Plus lots of preparations of eggs.  And vegetarian items.  And the kind of breakfast stuff that my grandma would make, like chipped beef.  Bottomless refills of coffee.  Good service.  Good sized portions of food, you won't walk away hungry.  Super reasonable prices.  Definitely a keeper.

I really enjoyed my experience here.  It's tucked away and I actually walked past it several times before it dawned on me which door to use.  The inside is dark and has a dive bar feel, though it's no dive bar.  I came here for lunch so there weren't many other customers, which definitely helped with the dive bar feel.  The food was really good!  Everything had great flavor and I really enjoyed the beans.  There was plenty of food and I found the price point to be good.  The service was good, I didn't want for anything.  I'm really glad I tried this place.

I don't have anything unique to add to the long list of positive reviews.  The service was great.  The beer was cold.  The bangers and mash pasty was amazing, particularly the homemade sage sausage.  My friend had a mushroom garlic soup that was fantastic.  This is definitely on the short list of places I will revisit when I'm in Phoenix.

A small mom&pop hot dog joint with a variety of dog styles and Italian beef sandwiches.  I got the garbage dog, consisting of cheese, chili, sauerkraut, & cole slaw.  I don't know if the toppings are homemade, but they taste good.  I liked the french fries, they taste like "real" fries and not some bag of ore-ida potato paste.  The prices were low, I feel like I got a good deal.  The owners were absolutely wonderful.  If it weren't for the billion degree heat, Johnnie's could totally have been a dog joint in Chicago.

According to the bartender, I sat on the non-divey half of the bar because I was a little confused that many of the reviews called this a dive bar. Either that or my definition of a dive bar involves more hobos and dilapidated captain's chairs with the not so faint smell of old cigarette smoke and moldy wood paneling.   At any rate...the beer selection is GREAT.  As an almost exclusive imbiber of the IPA , it was pretty great having several good beers to choose from.  And the kimchi bulgogi fries were stupendous.  Stupidly delicious.  My Korean mom is probably shaking her fist at the mere thought of the gluttonous, fatassery of a huge plate of fries covered in meat and kimchi.  You can also choose to get tots over fries.  Why I didn't notice that before I placed my order...I'll just have to live with myself until next time.  I would totally come back here, maybe next time I'll come at an hour where there are other patrons.  I bet this place gets a lot of cool people milling about.

Boulders is one of my regular spots in Phoenix. I love the beer list.  There is always a good variety on the tap.  There is an app you can download to check out the selection.   They also have a full bar. The food is typical bar food.  Sandwiches, pizza, calzones, salads, burgers.  It's a-ight.  I usually just stick with their appetizers.  They overdress the hell out of their salads to the point that it's soupy.   The service is generally good in the bar area; but that's what happens when you become a barfly I guess...they're nice to the regulars.  They have a largish outdoor seating area where you can smoke.   They have a great happy hour.  There is always an eclectic group of customers.  I've met some good peeps here. The  jukebox is pretty stupendous.   Televisions show the sports.   They are really into biking and have some bike nights.   They have a very popular trivia night.

I fly a lot.  And I used to not mind flying on Delta, despite the fact that their flights rarely take off on time and seem to always be overbooked and have flight attendants who would never win Miss Congeniality.  And other than MSP and a few newer shared terminals, the Delta terminals are overcrowded crap.  But then to add insult to injury, they changed their partnership rules with other carriers.  Now I pay for a bag to avoid checking at the gate or having somebody crush my stuff with their overly large "carry-on."  No SKY privileges anymore.  I know, I know...that seems really whiny; but when somebody takes it away suddenly...man, it stings.  So why would I choose this airline when I can have an equally poor experience from another airline for a cheaper price, or a better flight for the same price?  The obvious answer is, I wouldn't.

Clean.  Nice workers.  But let's face it...quality Chinese food, this ain't.  The vegetables had a weird film of...something.  Everything else tasted very sugary and overly salty all at once.  But in a pinch, it'll fill your belly and not break your wallet.

I was looking for some sort of frozen treat during a week of 112 degree weather.  Zoyo hit the spot.  Very spacious and newish looking in a very large outdoor shopping center.  Lots of froyo flavors.  Lots of toppings.  They could do a better job labeling the toppings, I was pretty sure one was candy, but it looked like the dried out yolks from a hard boiled egg.  Nobody could figure out what it was.  I don' t know if the price is good or bad as I don't usually go to these places, but it seemed okay for what I got.  I would go back.  At the very least, to try and solve the topping mystery.

I came here on a work trip and enjoyed the experience.  It was pretty busy, but I was seated and served right away.  My server was pleasant and attentive.  I didn't have to wait long for my food or drink.  I had a moscow mule, it was done well and was refreshing.  I wasn't feeling an entree so I had the salut sampler appetizer plate.  Everything on it was fairly tasty.  The salut fries and quinoa fritters were the stand outs.  The hummus nachos and mac and cheese balls were okay.   I'd revisit this place.

Super chill with warm, friendly staff.  I had a great discussion about the difference between a macaron and macaroon with the bartendress, who apparently had just competed in a local bartending competition.  Great aesthetic with an indoor and outdoor seating area.  You can sidle up to the bar from outside as well.  A nice selection of beers and wines with a full bar, plus espresso.  I had a sandwich that was quite good.  It was a Rachel (Reuben with turkey instead of pastrami or corned beef).  The bread was super thick, so it was a mouthful and a half.  I was more than satisfied with the portion.  I also had a cookie because you got a free one with a Yelp checkin, not the macaron.  It was delicious.  I would go back here on a nice day fo'sho.

I've been staying at this hotel since it's previous inception as Fiesta Hotel.  It's a decent Doubletree.  The rates are usually fair.  The rooms are mostly remodeled and they are clean and pretty spacious.  The air conditioner is super loud though.  The hhonors rooms have water and sometimes a snack ready for you.  As an hhonors member, you get free breakfast coupons and a drink coupon on arrival.   The staff is friendly.  There is a large pool that I have never had the chance to use.  The grounds are nicely manicured with lots of different cacti and succulents.  They have meeting rooms, an okay restaurant and bar, a massage/spa area during the day, gym (also never used, but larger than most hotel gyms).  The breakfast is pretty standard for a Hilton.  The location is pretty convenient if you kick around Tempe or need to be close to the airport.  They have a shuttle.  There are a lot of places in Phoenix to stay, and I keep coming back here, so that says something.

I love this place.  From the first visit, I knew this was a joint I would frequent whenever I come to town for work.  In fact, I have my coworker addicted to this place now.  We decided that since this place is so great, it's on the short list of places to go with the company cool kids secret club.    The customer service is great, like really great.  The owner is helladope.  He always has an exuberant greeting, handshake, or hug for me whenever I come in.  The guys behind the counter are always super friendly and helpful.  Didn't know you needed a spoon and ketchup?...don't fret, they knew you did and they'll bring it to you.  The prices are low.  You can fill yourself up to bursting for less than twenty bucks.  There are quite a few things on the menu; but why would you get anything other than the Detroit Coney?  The hot dogs are great.  You know you're eating a good dog when it snaps when you bite into it.  The onions could be a little bit more oniony for me with just a little bit more bite to 'em.  The chili-fries are so so good.  I can feel my arteries clogging with every delicious bite and if I have a fat-girl heart attack on the way out of the door, it'll be worth it.  They also carry a bunch of Faygo, but you need not paint on your ICP face to have any.  I've had a few other things, but it's really all about the hot dogs and fries.

I've been wanting to try this place and had it bookmarked for a while.  I'm certainly glad I finally made it happen. I came here with a coworker for lunch & both of us really liked this place. The decor is pretty cool with a whole upcycled, reclaimed aesthetic & a very good looking bar area.  There is a huge outdoor seating area with misty fans blowing.   We were seated right away and the customer service was really great.  Our server was the right mix of competent, attentive, funny, gregarious, and professional.   My coworker and I both had the steak salad & it was total noms.  Plenty of steak cooked exactly as requested, lots of fresh fixings, and a dressing that was really well balanced in flavors, both on its own and with the salad. They have a lovely wine list.  They make lots of fancy bar drinks.   I would absolutely come back for lunch again or to try dinner.
