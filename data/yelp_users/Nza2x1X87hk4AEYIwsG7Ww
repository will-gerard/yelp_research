I wish I could give this place zero stars. One bad experience never deserves a bad review but after a month or so of consistently awful nights I have to give a bad review. This once great bar and grill has completely given up on customer service, the safety of their patrons, cleanliness, food quality, and the overall presentation of the bar. There are too many bars in old town for the lodge to be worth your while.   If you work here and are reading this please do something to change this reputation.

This bar is the perfect spot for any occasion. It's a classy place with a lot to offer when it comes to drinks, customer service, cleanliness, and atmosphere. Everything about mable's makes it great.

Will never be back to this bar thanks to the loud mouth bartender.

If you are reading this then my goal is to keep you from wasting your time at this bar. You will find the crowd and staff to be some of the biggest scum bags you have ever met. If you fit in with this crowd then you might love it. If you have any self respect you will have a much better time at any of the more established pubs in the area.   Bottom line, the service is awful, the food is barely edible, and there are much better options in the immediate area.
