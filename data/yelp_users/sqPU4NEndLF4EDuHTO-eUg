New management, same old habits. Service is extremely slow. Came in just before 7pm got seated right away, but waited at least 15 min before anyone even came back to us. My uncle had to get up and put in our order, sitting here now a total of 45 min while I write this review and still have yet to receive our soup. A table came in 20 min after us has already had their soup. There doesn't seem to be enough workers to cover the entire restaurant. Few kids are constantly running around the place as well as up and down the stage. Rule one of restaurant etiquette, control your kids!  The food was pretty good though, not sure if it was cause we were super hungry by the time the food came. Today being Chinese New Years they had a special treat with some lion dancers. Other than that because of the slow service this place is a no go for me.

Great food for a low low price, be sure to check in for a free drink. The flavors were on spot! Never had a more flavorful bowl of soup that comes with the rice dish. Some issues was the rice plate is a bit small compared to other places and they don't actually have broken rice. Also save some room for their fresh macaron ice cream sandwich, perfectly made! It's a shame they're located all the way in phoenix.

Great little place for small groups of people. The parking was hard to get, but by the time we got in and ordered; it was worth it. We grabbed a seat at the bar because it was quite busy. Food tasted pretty good and filled us right up.  The atmosphere was nice after getting outside to hangout for a bit. There was live jazz music playing and a warm fire to sit near.

Been here multiple times, still one of the best revolving sushi around town. This place is usually busy but if you get there just before it opens than you will be seated right away.  The atmosphere is pretty good, prices cheap, food is good, and service is good. When coming in the restaurant is pretty big, probably too big for the actual used space. They have one main rotating sushi bar where everyone sits around and grabs things off the conveyer. That only takes up half the room; the other half isn't really used since most people want to sit near the conveyer. I believe they should do a remodel to kind of utilize that unused space; this way they can add more larger tables on both sides for bigger parties while getting the benefit of the conveyer.  Food there tastes a whole lot better than other revolving sushi I've tried, and they keep adding other selections to their menu. I definitely recommend getting the Haru sushi, and if it isn't on the belt then order it from the waitress.  Portion of each dish ranges from 2-4 pieces depending on which thing you get. Price per dish is reasonable ranging from $1-3 dollars. I could easily rack up a $15-20 dollar bill on my own if I don't pace myself.  Service here is generally good, once they seat you and ask if you want anything to drink, they pretty much leave you alone. I suppose that could be a good or a bad thing depending on how people view it. I personally like to be left alone while I'm eating. I think it's nice that they leave you alone here to eat, but they need a little improvement; there have been times where I've had to flag down the waitress to get in an order or get our check.  Overall, I will continue to go back here anytime I have the craving for some cheap sushi.

Definitely not impressed. Haven't been here in a long time and a lot has changed. There has been a redesign in the layout. There used to be granite tables now it's cheap tables covered with a cloth, which would be ok until you sit down and notice the butcher paper used to cover the cloth; what a cheap move!!  Service was incredibly slow even though they where only about a quarter capacity. Most of our food came out before our drinks and we had to constantly ask for all the necessities for our food. Chili, silverware, sauces, etc.. The flavor of the food was as good as I remember, but when considering the price of what you pay versus the portion size I rate this a fail. Be prepared to pay a good $20 per person for your food, drink, and tip then walk out still feeling hungry. As of right now I say avoid this place and find some place else to fill you up.

Terrible service. I'm literally sitting here waiting for my food to be cooked. I know it's nice knowing my food is being cooked fresh, but for a fast food place to completely run out of the things I wanted is just bad. I'm now having to wait 15-20 min for a fast food place to cook my food is ridiculous. They should know that the popular food items that are running low should be made right away to replenish before it completely out. As I'm waiting another customer came back in to complain about his order being short; I think he was in the drive through. I feel bad for the people thinking the drive through would be any faster since they too had to wait for the items to be cooked. Also while sitting here waiting for them to cook the tables are all completly dirty with crumbs all over. I will still eat Panda Express in the future; it just wont be from this location.

This place is ridiculous. Never have I had to wait so long to get any service. I arrived 30 min early to fill in new patient forms for my 4pm appointment. When finished I waited for them to call me. Just passed 4pm they finally call me to do the general bp, height, and weight check. Then I'm pushed into another waiting room. Wait there for another 20-30 min till I'm called to go i lin the doctors room. Again I wait another 20-30 min before my doctor came in. I saw people that arrived after I did and got seen before I was even called during my wait. When I finally saw my doctor he kept making excuses such as one of his nurses called out and his wife was nagging him to hurry and finish to go home. The exam felt really rushed and since the wait was so long it made me forget to mention something I came in for.  I'm here again now to get some blood drawn for some tests and I have been sitting here for over 40 min after signing in and still have yet to be greeted. My name was second on the list after several names have been crossed out already. Drawing blood is one of the fastest things to do and should be less than 5 min per person. So why am I having to wait over 40 min to be called? Literally just got called right now while typing to get my papers and now have to wait again.  I used to have Cigna and you would never expect this type of service.

Came here for lunch with some friends and it wasn't all that busy. Sat down, got our drinks, and took a look at the menu. Everything in the menu sounded delicious! My friends both got the chicken parmesan and I got a chicken alfredo which was not on the menu but they were happy to make it. After a long wait about 45 min our food finally came out; I repeat the place wasn't very busy maybe about 3 other tables were occupied. Other than that I do have to say the food was worth the wait; pasta had great flavor and perfectly cooked chicken. It was kind of odd to me that the linguini they used for my dish was thin, almost like spaghetti thin, but still good in every way. I would definitely eat there again.

First time at this place and it was pretty good, just like the blue sky parking. Service was quick and has options to choose covered or uncovered parking. Lowered 1 star because the prices are a bit more expensive than others.

Take it from an asian, this place was mediocre at best.   First let me say this was somewhat hard to find; it's kind of tucked in the back corner behind the bank on 7th st and Myrtle.  Anyways,   The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more. Starting off at $8 bucks just for the soup and a handful of noodles? Honestly it's just way too much for how little you get. Then you add your protein which can range in price. I ordered just the shoyou broth with pork for an add on of $1.50; when my bowl came out I looked at it and was thinking where is my meat? It was all shredded up into little bits.  I give it 2 stars for the decor; it was pretty nice and well lit. Bathrooms were nice as others have said. The service was ok; the two girls that served was friendly, but got lots of orders mixed up even with them numbering our tickets by seat positions.  I've definitely had better! A mile down the street is Republic Ramen it's cheaper than Umami and has a larger portion size. Needless to say I will never be going back here again.

Even after reading all the bad reviews on here; I went ahead and tried it out because my cousins wanted to try it. Lets just say these reviewers know what they're talking about. Being a pretty big sushi fan I have to agree 100% this place is just not very good. Lets start off with the sushi. First impressions, while waiting for my party to arrive, I scanned through all the different selections of what was available. Like all the other reviewers, these portions are incredibly small. Not only is the quantity per plate is small but also the sushi itself; it is half the size of a regular sushi roll. I was pretty disappointed of the quantity of plates just sitting on the conveyer belt with so little customers in the restaurant. I literally saw the same plate that no one wants go by the entire time my party was there. The flavor of each sushi was ok; some did not taste as fresh as others but that's to be expected of a revolving sushi. The nigiri had just a bit too much rice.  Next, lets talk about the service. Our waiter was good at best, he made sure our drinks were constantly refilled, and picked up our plate toppers in a timely fashion which is a plus. That is possibly the only thing good out of service; now to the bad, one of my cousin had asked for some paper napkins because she had spilled some of the soy sauce early on during our dinner. By the end we still did not see the napkins. Next, our table had a few orders of edamame and generally when bringing out edamame you are suppose to bring an extra bowl to discard the uneaten portion, but no we had to ask our waiter to bring us the extra bowls, and also little dishes to put soy sauce in to dip our sushi. This stuff is just common knowledge of a sushi restaurant; the customers should never have to ask for these things. Lastly, another cousin had ordered some fried calamari, but it took forever for it to come out; didn't see it come out till we were pretty much done with our dinner.  Congrats you've made it this far!! Thanks for hanging in there, but please keep reading just a bit more. Now to the decor; I have to say this is probably the only thing I liked about the place. Everything looked very clean and modern. Place was very well lit. Table choice however were a bit small, maybe this place isn't very well set up for larger parties. That seems to sum up my thoughts on this place; could probably keep going on but you all seem to get the point. Thanks for reading!

This place was great! Went with some friends for a few drinks at the bar and the service was excellent. The bartender would check in every so often to see if we needed anything. After we were done drinking he gave us some water and made sure we never ran dry.  The decor and lighting looked really nice as well. The look of this place felt relaxed and chill. We didn't get any food because we ate at a different place before hand, buy might have to come back another time and try their food.

Just got finished eating my to-go order and boy was it amazing. I've kept hearing good things about this place and I finally got a chance to try it out. I ordered a Hawaiian bqq and added capicola meat and my sister got a custom tomatoe pesto with a variety of veggies. As I sat down waiting for my order, not even a minute later my pizzas were ready. Completely took me by surprise that it was baked so quickly. I love the chipotle style of service which makes each pizza unique. Only complaint is that they should have some sort of sign up labeling the selection of choices. I had no idea what the capicola was nor did I know some of the cheese choices. But after asking the staff, they were happy to explain. Would definitely recommend and eat here again!

Great little find. Never knew about this place until I was referred here by a Caswell staff. After walking in we were greeted almost instantly. Staff was very friendly, helpful, and somewhat knowledgeable. The guy that initially helped us out joked around with us and helped me take a look at a few guns, to my surprise they had the guns that I wanted to look at. When I finally decided on the one I wanted he got the paperwork, and then he disappeared to help another customer. It was then where literally 3 different staff members were helping me out; was a bit odd. Overall experience wasn't bad, I still ended up getting what I wanted at a slightly higher price than Caswells, but at least I could have it today instead of having to order it online and wait. Cute girl that worked there even said she liked me better than the last guy that looked at the piece I bought ;)

First time using fox rental from phoenix location. I usually use the one in vegas and have always been treated well. This location is no different. Quick service and low prices to rent from. Was greeted and got help right away. Friendly staff joked with us and was awesome enough to give us a free upgrade to a bigger car. I was lucky and got a brand spanking new 2015 nissan altima with only 6k miles. Would definitely recommend this company!

After trying this place out, I was not too impressed with it. The restaurant size is a bit small and decor is pretty nice (Bring a pen you can tag the walls). There wasn't a lot of people there probably cause this place is still new. I ordered 1lb craw fish with the trifecta sauce and medium hotness; waitress told me they run hot with their spices, but I feel that is a lie. I guess it's because I'm used to eating hotter things, but their medium tasted sweet to me. I also added the 4 slices of sausages and a potato for a little extra. One thing that I didn't like was that the sausages and potato was not cooked with my craw fish, but instead it was cooked in separate bags. I over heard the waitress at a different table tell the couple you can have the add-ons put in the same bag as the seafood.  Pricing wasn't bad, it's what you expect from any seafood restaurant like this.   Service was good, waitress and waiter were friendly and kept refilling our drinks. kept up with our trash buckets swapping out filled ones with new empties. Our group did however had to remind them about some missing items; they couldn't remember what we ordered. Then again these were just high school kids probably their first job.  Overall, I don't think I'll be returning to this place anytime soon.

I guess I should update this since I have been here three times now. I was going to add a star to my review for the second visit until this third visit. (See review of third visit). The second experience was better for me. I ordered a pound of shrimp hot trifecta. I gotta say it was pretty good. Mine came over seasoned but it made it more better. I can't say the same for my friends..they ordered the same as I did but they all said it wasn't hot and spicy. In fact, they ask started to dip into my sauce and loved it more. Another had to send theirs back for being undercooked.  For this third visit, third times a charm right? Wrong. This time I ordered the fried cat fish which at first I was grossly discussed by since mine came undercooked. Had them take it back and make a new one. Second one came out amazing but was missing the cole slaw and correct sauce it came with the first time, no biggie. The waitress even took it off our bill. The rest of the food was pretty good. My family ordered the Dungeness crab, shrimp, and clams each of those turned out good.  Another note, after being opened for over 6 months now you would think they would get their choking timing down by now. Also they were surprisingly busy tonight.

Over a year later and WOW! Much have been improved. Lets start with the food since it has always been my number one complaint. We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp and and snow crab. Quality was near perfect, it was seasoned just right and came out very quickly. In the past when it came out that fast we would end up sending it back for being undercooked; it seems like they got their cook timing correct. I'm guessing they already had most of the popular items precooked and they just need to measure it out and add the sauce. The service has much improved too; he got the orders correct and was very tentative throughout our meal. Aside from having to wait an hour and half it was actually worth it after experiencing this improvement. Hopefully they keep this up! You've finally made a believer out of me.

Great for low cost food. Only complaint is they don't have enough normal tables, they mostly have booths which I don't like.

Cool place to hang out to eat and drink. Lots of college age people hang out here since its close to ASU. They have all sorts of bar games if you can get to play them since they're always being used. I haven't tried to food to they have a good selection of drinks and lots of space to sit. Some even have a firepit. Would definitely recommend this as a hangout spot.

Being new this place is clean and bright. Looks like it could be a cool hangout spot. Owner was very friendly and told me about her grand opening coming up in a few days. While I can't comment about their shaved snow. I came in and ordered 1 large taro milk tea with boba, and 1 thai tea with boba. She was a bit inconsistent in making the drinks as my taro was not filled to the brim and the thai tea was overflowing. I got home with the drinks and dove right into the taro. First impression was this drink tastes smooth; you can still taste a bit of the powder used for the drink but I've had worse at other places. Second impression was the boba, while it was soft and tender; it could have used an extra minute or two in the boiler. Overall, ill have to come back and try the other items on the menu.

Came here yesterday evening with the family for an early mothers day celebration. This place looks amazing on the inside! Very bright and colorful. This is the same owner as Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler, so naturally the price and food were similar. It did have some items that you never see at Pacific though so that's a plus. Also the sushi here looks way better, nice big cuts of sashimi. Being new* I hope this wasn't for show and keep up the same quality service Even though the shashimi was very fresh the tuna was very pale, signs of a low quality fish. The plates were pretty dirty I had to swap two or three dishes to find one that was decent. The waitress/waiter service was a bit slow, I was nearly finished with my second dish by the time our drinks came out, and seemed like forever to get dirty dishes picked up.  Being mothers day weekend I'll give them a bit of leeway. Overall, I would come here again for the sushi.  *This being new it has changed owners a few time.

Great new find! Little over a month old and I can tell they will explode in customers. The quality of their drinks are definitely cali quality. Everything is all precisely measured to maintain top quality flavor and texture. They have a huge menu selection which can be a bit too much to look through if your new to the place, be sure to check out their Facebook page for a complete menu before. If you like vanilla bean and almond flavor I recommend the snow bowl. The honey boba was also perfect from start to finish of the drink; in other words they remained soft and chewy till the end. I've had drinks from other places where the boba would become really cold and hard towards the end.  Man just writing this makes me crave to go and get a cup; it's too bad that it's nearly midnight as I type this, also the fact that it's quite a drive from chandler. Only issue I have really is the price over $5 for the largest size! Then again that's your typical price for a grande size of starbucks fraps so it balances out. The price inflation is real! I suppose it has to do with the whole minimum wage issue. Anyways, overall I will recommend this place! Hopefully they get those loyalty punch cards soon. I'm losing valuable stamps!
