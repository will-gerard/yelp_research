Appropriately named a Phoenix Point of Pride, the DBG is a great place to be outdoors in Phoenix nearly any time of the year. It's especially great in the spring when the cactus blooms are on display.  The Luminaria Nights in the winter are an annual event for us. They have fantastic special events year round day and night, information all over the place about what you're looking at, and very well-informed employees and volunteers throughout the gardens to help you find your way or find out more about what's there.  A really fantastic place for photographers, by the way, as you can see from the photos shown above.  Try going as early in the morning as you can. There's more animal activity at that time and you're more likely to see the jackrabbits, desert tortoises, and a variety of lizards and snakes.

I don't usually rave about food as I'm eating dinner. Heck, I don't usually stop to actually taste the food. I usually just scarf it down and go. Tonight was an exception.  Starting with the steamed clams for an appetizer and on to the salad greens with pecans topped by balsamic dressing, the start of this dinner went very well.  Then Chef Sanchez' main courses came out. My companion had the Maine lobster and I had the halibut. The lobster was done to tender perfection and the halibut was flavorful, moist, and flaky. I found myself taking time to savor the taste of the halibut along with the grilled portabello mushroom cap, deep fried tomato, and asparagus.  Even the presentations were amazing and the service from our waiter, David, was exemplary.  The ambience, the service, the food... all top of the line. I don't expect any of that from a restaurant chain which made the experience that much better.

Just started taking our car to them this past year. Been there a couple of times for different issues and we've gotten service done well, done right, and done professionally each time.  They don't try to upsell and they don't try doing things that don't actually need to be done. They've now got our business not only for the big stuff, but for ongoing maintenance as well.

My wife found this place searching around for seafood restaurants in the area. Were it not for her, we probably never would have found Roma Garden or if we had seen it in passing, we would have just kept on going, and that would have been our loss.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you step in the front door, the aromas, decor, and very friendly service will show you something different than you'd ever expect from a strip mall storefront.  There was a birthday party a few tables over and a variety of people of all ages who appeared to be having a very enjoyable evening.  The food was excellent with fresh ingredients and generous portions and the service was attentive and helpful. Reasonable prices and easy access to parking rounds out the pleasant experience. We'll be back to sample more of their menu soon.

My only real complaint is they're not open year round. They are open while the seasonal fruits and vegetables they sell are fresh and in season which makes perfect sense. They also have lots of fruit spreads, marmalades, jellies, honeys, nuts, treats, juices, and more.  Friendly staff (I haven't run into the grumpy staff other people seem to have), good prices, and fresh product. I also haven't run into the spoilage at least one other person mentioned.  I haven't tried this, but I understand they ship products so you can share Arizona's bounty with friends and family out of state.

Went shopping in the area today, but my wife and I wanted to get something for lunch first and decided to treat ourselves to a sit-down meal rather than fast food for once. Very glad we did.  We started with the spinach and artichoke appetizer which also came with a fresh, mild salsa. Both dips were very good as were the tortilla chips.  For meals, she got the open face steak sandwich while I went for the turkey burger. The steak was cooked to perfection and was incredibly tender. The burger with chipotle sauce was also grilled and presented well. We both had fries which were flavored just right.  Our server was very helpful (even if she didn't know quite everything about the menu), friendly, attentive... everything that you'd expect from an establishment that has a goal of being part of the neighborhood.  Great atmosphere, great service, and excellent food. We'll definitely be back and may try their other locations as well.

Never been to a Mimi's Cafe before, but my wife and I decided to go tonight. We got off to a very slow start at this location. It took a little long to be greeted at the door. We were first seated at a booth that was too cramped, then reseated in the sparsely inhabited dining room at a half booth/half table. The chairs were a tight squeeze and appeared to be the only ones in the restaurant with arms. I moved over to the booth side to sit next to my wife and was comfortable from then on.  Good thing, since no one seemed to be in the mood to be our server. Apparently, as was explained later, the person running the front changed around who was serving what table and didn't bother to tell the servers.  Once we finally got a server, things went much better. We got our drinks, appetizer, and soups quickly.  The soup, clam chowder (Friday's soup du jour) was rich, thick, and flavorful. Our appetizer, spinach and artichoke dip, fit that description as well.  Our entrees were also quite good. My wife had the tilapia which was cooked quite well and was moist and tender. The vegetables tasted fresh and not overcooked. The mashed potatoes were quite good as was my chicken cordon bleu, though the chicken was a little overdone. Moist and tender on the inside, but too crunchy on the outside.  After the apology over the serving mix up and the long wait, the night went smoothly. Our server, Tom, was personable and we enjoyed watching him interact with another customer's child.  We'll be back at some point to try other things on the interesting menu. Might even save room for a dessert.

Very thorough exam by Dr. Yamamoto who reviewed my history and progress. Never felt rushed. Nicole was wonderfully warm and professional with her part of the exam. Great team all around as always!

My girlfriend has been craving a mushroom steak and cheese sub for the past couple of weeks, and while that's easy to find in New England where we're both from, it's not so easy to find in the Phoenix area.  But, now we know where to look.  Great sandwiches and a great looking menu that we'll be exploring for quite a while. And they also stock a variety of Wise potato chips products which aren't widely available here.  For a taste of home, we know where to go, and we'll be back.

I've been meeting with friends here for dim sum for the past few years and also had dinner here a few weeks ago. The food is consistently quite good, affordable, and fresh. The service is generally quite good as well.  My bride and I held our wedding reception here this past weekend in the small private room at the back of the dining room. The service and food were great and our guests enjoyed the dim sum adventure, a first for many of them. Fun and affordable!  The fun part is we'll be able to return to our reception restaurant with our friends anytime we like.

Apparently I went to a different Pick Up Stix than Richard and Chris.  *checks receipt*  Nope. Same one.  Anyway, I didn't have any trouble with the doors, I don't really care too much about the color of sweet and sour sauce so long as it tastes good, and I wasn't expecting anything above and beyond Panda Express. It's Asian fast food. I had moderate expectations.  I got better than moderate results.  The food was quite good. My girlfriend who is incredibly picky about chicken wings had tried the house special wings just hours before at the Camelback location while out and about and wanted more. This location was closer to home, so I went there and picked up stuff aside from the wings.  We got egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, and wonton soup, all of which were very good. Nothing gourmet about it, mind you, but very good.  Teresa, the woman taking orders at the front counter, was friendly and helpful. Not overly so, but I didn't feel like she was completely bored with the world, either. The guys in the kitchen worked fast and got the food to me within a very few minutes (about 5 is what it felt like, but I wasn't counting). I picked it up at the counter and went on my way home for some delicious food that stood up to microwave reheating the next day for lunch.  Not a huge variety of food, but what they serve seems to turn out quite well. I've been to the Camelback location a couple of times. This is my first at the Chandler location. I've yet to be disappointed.  **Added August 4, 2009: Went back to the same location a couple nights later to try their beef teriyaki bowl and chicken fried rice. Again, both quite good, though there was too much sauce on the teriyaki.

Very small, very popular breakfast spot in historic Gilbert. They feature quite the variety of omelets (which can also be done as scrambled eggs) and an option to create your own combination. The omelets are huge and fluffy, home fries are perfectly spiced and not greasy, and the whole wheat French bread is an interesting touch (think wheat Texas toast).  The coffee was very good as well.  Service was quick after the short wait to get in. The food was fresh and fast, and even though others were waiting to get in, we weren't rushed out the door. We didn't linger, but we didn't feel unwelcomed to stay, either.  Quaint atmosphere, excellent food, outstanding service, and reasonable prices. Only downside I can see is the poor availability of parking, but that's not the fault of the restaurant.  We'll be back next time we're in the East Valley around breakfast time.

Great portions of incredibly flavorful food. The burritos are jam packed with meat. The tacos are flavored just right and topped with colorful pico.  The relatively new location in the shopping center on the northeast corner of 48th St and Baseline may look like just another fast food Mexican storefront, but the food is well worth checking out.  Edited to add 5/23/2011: Nearly 3 years later and they're still in business and still excellent. Quick service and very good food from a simple but varied menu. While there was no one else in the place tonight, I'm really hoping that's not the norm. Quite a few businesses in this shopping center have shut down. This doesn't deserve to be one of those.

This is in a stand alone building near Bashas' at Warner and McClintock where you wouldn't necessarily expect to find a decent sit-down restaurant, but there it is.  My wife and I have been here 3 times now and we've gotten good food each time along with great service from Darryl who we were lucky enough to get on our first visit and have requested during our return visits. Management has been very accommodating of our request.  The ambiance is interesting. There's the sport bar-like bar area and the restaurant lounge area where we enjoy our meals. The usual lounge singer is reasonably good, though his pre-recorded backing arrangements often drown out his vocals. On rare occasion that's not a bad thing, but usually his vocals are quite good and he plays some instruments live quite well.  The food is interesting. The bread at the beginning of the meal isn't so great, but the appetizers we've had along with the meals have been quite good. Prices are reasonable considering the quality and quantity you get.  Overall, a good experience. We'll be back.

Even on one of the hottest days of the year in Phoenix, this place had spots that were considerably cooler making it a pleasant morning hike. It's probably a lot nicer during cooler weather.  The volunteers that greeted us were wonderful. They gave us some background on the preserve, invited us to have a look around inside, and gave us insights as to what we'd find when we got to the trails. Since it was our first time there, a volunteer guide took us to a specific point and gave us even more background and information. He helped us map out our first hike and sent us on our way.  There's a large variety of trees throughout the preserve and a few places with water (a pond and a small portion of a river). The trails we went on were reasonably easy to navigate and had many places to sit and take in our surroundings or even wait around for birds or other animals to cross our paths.  We did get to see some lizards and a few birds along the way and we're looking forward to going back for more in the near future and for years to come.  Photographers will want to bring their zoom and macro lenses. Everyone else might want to bring a decent pair of binoculars.  The visitor center has educational displays, brochures for the area and for other Nature Conservancy areas throughout Arizona, restrooms, water and soda for sale, and wonderful volunteers who will help in any way they can.

Hadn't eaten at a Top Shelf for several years. Happened upon this one and I'm glad I did.  Starting with the chips and salsa, they were both fresh and tasty. My waiter, Dave, was very helpful and quick. The food (chicken tacos with beans and rice) were also fresh and very good.  Maybe not the best ever place for Mexican food, but it certainly is well above average. Good prices for the portions, too.

Attended a going away party on the patio. Apparently there was some event going on in the bar that was much more important than anything on the patio. Or decent food.  The dog-friendly patio (a plus) has a very uneven floor which makes the stools wobbly (a minus and a safety hazard).  They might have had 3 servers on duty (I know they had 2 and I think I saw a third) who were absolutely overwhelmed with the crowd. There were 2 servers who occasionally made their way to the patio. My wife went into the bar to secure a couple of menus since no one could be bothered to bring one out to us. The waitress later came by, not to take our orders, but to ask if we were done with the menus since they ran out and needed some inside for people who were apparently more important than us. We handed over the menus which were falling apart and put in our orders which the waitress seemed surprised we were ready to put in (yeah, we were done with the crappy menus because we were ready to order -- does that not make sense?). She also got the order wrong.  The drink my wife ordered was watered down. Service was slow and inaccurate. First order that came out wasn't ours which confused the waitress -- second was ours, but was wrong and we couldn't hold the server's attention long enough to get that message across.  The food was nearly inedible. The steak tacos were passable, though I've had better from Del Taco. The steak was poorly seasoned and dry. As for the beans and rice, the beans were undercooked, the rice was overcooked, the cheese had the consistency of plastic, and all the food was cold.  My wife's "Macho Nachos" were completely inedible. Steak once again was dried out, they ran out of guacamole (seriously, a Mexican themed restaurant runs out of guac at 8pm on a Saturday?), and -- are you ready? -- the tortilla chips were burnt. I'm not even kidding. They were charred around the edges.  When the waitress, who never returned to see how we were doing or find out if we wanted more drinks, finally came by to settle up (after I went into the bar and got cashed out by the bartender since we didn't see our waitress for nearly an hour), she did, after standing there in shock for a few seconds, offer to try to do something to make things right. We'd already paid and we certainly had no intention of trying to let them make more horrible food for us so we told her to forget it and we left.  While I had barely enough to eat, my wife hadn't had anything so we stopped by Burger King on the way home where the service was quick, friendly, and accurate -- a complete contrast to Flicka's.  Fortunately we weren't there for the drinks and food. Or for the band which, I must admit, sounded great. We were there to gather with folks to see a friend off on a new adventure and that part of the evening went well. Based on Flicka's performance, though, we'll steer clear of this place.

Not quick, but freshly cooked food. Great fish and chips and fried sides like the deep fried mushrooms and zucchini.  There's a little bit of outdoor seating available and no indoor seating. This is a mostly "to go" kind of place, and with gas prices as they are, you probably won't want to sit around in the drive thru waiting for your food with the car running.  Friendly employees, good food, and decent prices. It's no wonder this is a Phoenix area institution.  Be sure to bring cash. They don't accept credit cards and they don't accept checks.

Horrible! Most of the employees, including some who were apparently off duty, were too busy hanging around chatting with each other to get orders packed correctly, interact with customers in a friendly manner, or clean the disgusting bathrooms and customer seating area.  Edited to add this follow-up: Complained to KFC about the lousy service, wrong food, and disgusting, dirty conditions. Got a standard apology letter with a $5 certificate usable only at the location we told them we'd never go to again. Way to go KFC! Way to listen to your customers. Not that they have to since they're so big, but it makes me question myself every time I get a thought about visiting any of their stores, and I've stopped myself from going there from time to time.

Weird. I've been going here for so many years that I thought I must have written a review and I came here to update it. Apparently I've been slacking and this is the first time I've reviewed this Phoenix landmark!  Love this place whether for take out or table service. The food occasionally misses, but that'll happen just about anywhere. Overall, the food is great, the prices are reasonable, and the people are quite lovely.  Sadly, it seems that people forget this place is around and after 40 years it may be heading toward an ending sooner rather than later, and that would be a shame. My wife and I were there recently on a weekend for lunch and were surprised to be the only patrons in the place. A few more, including a large group who'd never been there before, showed up after a while, but it was just odd.  Like I said, the food is wonderful and I've always liked the people here. Say "hi" to Maria, the woman who usually runs the front, when you go in. But whatever you do, go there. Get take out or dine in, but go! If you have a craving for Chinese food when you're in the central Phoenix area, stop on in and support this local icon. They deserve your continued support.

My wife and I visited for our weekly Friday night out and we'll certainly be back. The food was excellent. PJ had one of the daily specials, orange roughy in asparagus sauce, and I had the rigatoni bolognese. The service was top notch and checked on us often throughout the evening making recommendations along the way.  As much as we like him, we could have done without the constant Frank Sinatra music. At least throw in a little Tony Bennett once in a while, guys. ;)  Overall relaxing atmosphere in the restaurant side. We didn't even know there was a bar until we took a detour to the restrooms on the way out and exited through the bar which, while quite noisy, couldn't be heard from the dining room.  The place is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall, not where I'd expect it to be at all considering the dining experience which was fancy without being intimidating AND without breaking the bank.

Early on the Sunday morning of Memorial Day weekend, and I've got a leaky water heater. Checked Yelp and found A Plus. Checked a couple of other places and A Plus kept coming up with universally excellent reviews.  Good reason for that. They did a great job!  I talked with the owner, Steve, this morning. After sending some photos of the heater by phone, Steve set out to find a replacement heater. By early afternoon, Alan was here tearing out the old heater and installing the new one just over an hour. He answered my questions about maintenance and got the job done quickly and efficiently.  Now we've got a non-leaky, much more efficient water heater and a new place to call for our future plumbing needs.

OK, so it's in a strip mall in Peoria and the dull decor isn't some throwback to New York. The bread, however, is full and flavorful, the sandwiches are HUGE with lots of meat (or egg in the case of the egg salad sandwich) and simple toppings, and the service is very good. A little pricey, but worth it if you're in the area.

My wife and I made a reservation for 15-20 people for an after party following our wedding and reception this past weekend. The reservation was ready as requested. Good thing, too, since we had 19 people in attendance and the restaurant was absolutely packed.  The service was quite slow to start, but once it got going it went well. The food came out reasonably quickly for such a packed restaurant. Our server was friendly and even complimented us at the end of the meal for being such a fun group to deal with.  Our group had a good time, very good food, and decent service. About the only problem we had aside from the slow start to the service was the noise level as there were quite a few birthday celebrations throughout which required several servers to sing and clap loudly. It was a little disturbing for people in our party with sensitive hearing, though we all appreciated the friendly party atmosphere.

I rarely send food back to the kitchen to be cooked more and I've never had to send food back twice... until tonight.  So why 4 stars? We'll get to that.  When my wife and I first arrived, the place was pretty well packed. Yes, there were tables open, but the greeters were out of menus and had to wait for some to make their way back to the front desk before we could be seated. The greet staff appeared overwhelmed. When we were seated, the person who guided us to our seat (Jason?) didn't really seem to care much about what he was doing.  We had to wait for a bit for a server to show up, but Amy got our drink order and our appetizer order quickly once she made it to our table. The loaded potato skins appetizer was quite good.  We put in our dinner order and got our salads shortly after the appetizer arrived. And this is where things started falling apart. My wife's green salad was fine, but my Caesar salad wasn't as green as it should have been. The iceberg lettuce was turning brown.  Not that we had a lot of time to consider our salads since the entrees arrived very quickly. We both had steaks and baked potatoes. The potatoes were big and fluffy and quite well baked.  The steaks on the other hand... PJ ordered hers medium and I ordered mine medium well. They were both medium rare at best. Hers actually looked rare. We flagged down Amy who was surprised the steaks had shown up so quickly and so obviously undercooked. She apologized and took the steaks back to be cooked more.  Chris, the manager, soon showed up to apologize for the inconvenience and to thank us for our patience. I mentioned the brown lettuce to him and he took the offending salad away. He offered to bring something in place of the salad, but I declined.  The steaks came back and this time... they were maybe medium rare. Maybe. I told Amy the kitchen was making the restaurant look bad. She once again apologized profusely, seemed genuinely upset on our behalf, and took both steaks to Chris. He came by and this time started out by saying he was embarrassed. We mentioned that we'd been at the restaurant in the past and had very good experiences before, but it seemed like this was a really "off" night for them.  He agreed that something had gone off the rails and graciously comped our meals.  The steaks arrived again, but not the same ones. They cooked new steaks for us and this time they were just right. Amy stuck around to be sure as we cut into the middle of both our steaks to check them. They were flavored perfectly, cooked perfectly, and we ended up having a nice meal.  Chris gets points for dealing with us both times things went wrong and for crouching down to our eye level for the second apology and taking responsibility for the mistakes. Completely comping the meals was an unexpected and welcomed gesture. He also went out of his way to make sure we understood that Amy wasn't to blame (we knew that, but it was nice to see a manager have his employee's back like that).  Amy gets points for showing her concern for our satisfaction and for being just as baffled as we were over the obvious poor quality of the preparation of the steaks. Meat shouldn't be red on steaks done medium or above, and the first two were red through and through.  Both of them thanked us for our understanding and for not losing our cool (yes, PJ has mellowed me that much over the years). We got Amy to laugh a bit and she got us to laugh as well by asking if she could get us an "undercooked dessert" with a perfect deadpan expression. She earned her 20%+ (before the comp) tip.  So, even though we had an adventure of poorly timed food service, confused employees, and undercooked food, Amy and Chris went out of their way to make things right, and whoever cooked the new steaks for us showed us what we knew the kitchen was capable of doing. They screwed up, but they took responsibility and handled the situation quickly and professionally. That's why they get 4 stars for what could have been a 2 star performance or worse.

My wife and I stopped by this place, which is close to her office, over the weekend. She'd always wanted to stop there to see what they had and since we weren't finding anything else along our route for the day we diverted here. Very glad we did.  Great food and service. We had chicken wings (very juicy with great sauces), spinach artichoke asiago dip (thicker than we're used to but very tasty), and a wine burger with potato and sweet potato fries (delicious, cooked to order, and filling). Just right to get us going for the rest of the day. We'll be back!  Edited to add: We have, in fact, been back a couple of times. While not all the dishes are winners, the service certainly is and they do try their very best to please. Another one we'll keep going back to when we're in the neighborhood.

This little place just opened in a strip mall and you'd probably miss it if you didn't know it was there. Fortunately, I knew thanks to a well-timed coupon arriving in the mail.  The Cajun-inspired fried chicken is juicy with a crispy skin and just-right flavorings. I had coleslaw and mashed potatoes with gravy for sides and they were great. The gravy had just the right kick and the coleslaw was among the best I've ever tasted.  They also carry fried shrimp which I'll be back to try and they have many other sides including fried okra for those with the stomach for such things.  Friendly, helpful, and quick counter service in this to-go-only restaurant. It's small, but it has a big heart. It's part of a chain of restaurants, but this is the only one in Arizona so far. Here's hoping it's not the last!

Ate here once many years ago on our realtor's dime as we were looking for a house. Don't remember much about that visit, but today's is certainly memorable. Arguments in the kitchen, people in the kitchen slamming plates and glassware very loudly, chaos in the front... Granted it was a busy Sunday lunchtime, but it was just one thing after another, and pretty obvious that management was not in control of the situation.  The final blow came after my wife and I had only gotten our drinks after a lengthy wait, (coffee and orange juice) and had been waiting for food for half an hour only to be told they were out of bacon.  Out.Of.Bacon.  "America's Diner" cannot afford to be out of bacon. Rather than get substitutions (turkey bacon or sausage were offered), we opted to leave. Apologies all around on our way out the door, but even though we had nothing to eat, they just left a bad taste in our mouths.  I know Denny's isn't supposed to be a high class joint, but I don't expect that kind of incompetence from what should be a corporate well-oiled machine.

I've passed by this place so many times before thinking it would be a good idea to stop in some day and see what they had. I finally stopped in and found out it was, indeed, a very good idea to do so.  While fish & chips is front and center of what they do, they also have sandwiches, burgers, chicken wings, shrimp, and more, mostly deep fried. But, I had to go for fish & chips. If that's what they're going to build their business around, it had better be good.  It is. I chose the cod (you can also have whiting, catfish, or tilapia). The fish isn't processed, it's cut from filets, and it's hand breaded then deep fried to crispy perfection.  Also had the clams and mushrooms, both deep fried, and both very good. Their fries are a bit limp, but that makes it easier to sop up the vinegar if you decide to go tradtional on your fish & chips.  Next time I'm driving by thinking it would be a good idea to stop in and get dinner, I'll be more likely to do exactly that.

My fiancee and I stopped in while shopping in the area. She had pizza and a side salad, and I had a chicken parm sandwich and fries.  The fries were pretty pedestrian, but prepared well. Fluffy inside and crispy outside with just enough salt. Salad was fresh.  The chicken parm was a little overcooked, but still moist and quite good. The pizza was very thin, but quite tasty. Not quite what we were expecting from a small pizza pie, but surprisingly good.  Service was slow (we were there on a Saturday afternoon with only a couple other customers in the store and a couple of deliveries going out), but friendly. This is obviously a family run business with people who care about the business and their customers. If we're in the area again, we'll be back.

A few weeks ago these folks started teaming up with Shine Coffee near my office in mid-town Phoenix every Wednesday for what they call Shine & Dine.  I'm hooked.  The combos look very interesting, but I choose to build my own dogs and brats. I haven't been too adventurous with my choices yet, but there are so many toppings and combinations to explore, so...  I can attest to the tastiness of the beef dogs and bratwurst and their toppings are top notch so far. The naan bread the dogs are on is a nice change from conventional hot dog buns and really helps to make the experience worthwhile.  For anyone carping about $6 for a high quality hot dog or sausage on naan bread being served up to order with great toppings -- honestly, the whole world isn't Oscar Mayer or Hillshire Farms. This is really good stuff and in this case you get what you pay for. Shell out the bucks, kids. It's worth it.  Oh, they also have veggie dogs, regular ol' weiners, chicken, and corn dogs. I haven't tried any of them. Or the fried pickles. There's also a small menu just for the kids.  Very happy today to have to wait to place my order (food is cooked fresh, by the way). Glad they're getting more and more customers. They've earned it!

Wow. Another regular haunt and I haven't reviewed it yet? For shame. Let me make up for that right now.  Formerly stuck in a food truck, Shine has now become a comfy, tasty fixture of mid-town Phoenix. Across from the Heard Museum and just a bit north (an easy walk from the Central/Encanto light rail station), this place rocks. High quality coffees and teas (hot and iced), locally made pastries, and a great place to hang out both indoors and outdoors. The fancy coffees are great, but the plain ol' drip is my favorite. They also sell whole bean locally roasted coffee, the same brand they use to make their beverages.  The green space popping up between the coffee shack and the "living room" indoor lounge area, created with Kickstarter funding, is shaping up nicely as a pocket park. The folks who run this place not only bring quality food, drinks, and service to the area, but they care about making it a better place while they're at it.  Whether it's local residents out walking their dogs, local workers like me, or people just passing through, there's an eclectic mix for all your people watching moods.  And stop by for Shine & Dine Wednesday mornings when the Short Leash Dogs food truck parks out front for your lunchtime pleasure.  Edited to add: As of October 2014, Shine has been redubbed Rollover Doughnuts. Same great coffee and many of the same wonderful people, but new owners and brioche doughnuts instead of the pastries they used to sell. A few changes, but the quality remains high and I remain a satisfied customer.

Every Thursday we get food trucks outside my office building in central Phoenix. Emerson started coming around recently and I'm so glad they did. Incredible fry bread made fresh topped with fresh and flavorful ingredients.  I went for broke the first time I got lunch from them and tried the Jazzy which has grilled steak, beans, and a spring mix with pico de gallo and chipotle sauce on fry bread, a surprising combination that worked really well. The bread itself is the best I've ever had, very light and tasty. I've also had the Yolli, a more traditional beans and cheese dish which was quite good.  Do yourself a favor. If you see them at a food truck gathering or special event, get there early and feed your face.

The place is a little rundown, but don't let that deter you. The food was fantastic (my wife and I had breakfast - she had bacon and eggs and I had a pork chop and eggs) and the staff was very friendly and right on top of their game.  Prices were very reasonable and the quality of the food was better than expected. This is what a family-run kind of business should be. I have no idea if this is a family-run business, but it has the feel of one the way the folks there seemed to care about what they were doing. We'll definitely be back.  Edited to add: We've been back there a few times now for breakfast and lunch (and dinner on Friday evenings) and I have to say we'll keep going there. The owner does everything from cooking to cleaning, serving to seating, and the staff will make things right if you don't think everything's as good as it should be. The place can get crowded from time to time and I'm happy it can since it deserves to be busy.

If you're looking for honest-to-goodness grinders, you'll find them here. Lots of places claim to be New York style. This place really is. I grew up in Connecticut and went to school in New York. These subs are what I used to be able to walk down the street to get.  I've been here a couple of times now and what I've seen is good people who obviously care about what they're doing, and what they're doing is serving great subs and salads with fresh, flavorful ingredients at reasonable prices. I live in south Phoenix, but I'm in the Glendale/Peoria area on many weekends. When I'm there, I'll be making it a point to get lunch at Gatti's and maybe picking up supper there, too. And from what I've seen in the comments on their Facebook page, I need to get a cannoli next time I'm there.

Beautiful succulents arrangements in a variety of containers. The plants are in great shape and arranged with obvious care. Bought an arrangement this past weekend for my wife for Mother's Day and she likes it very much. Great prices, especially considering the craftsmanship.

My wife has been a regular customer of Raincharmer for many years since we stumbled across them at the old Indoor Swapmart on 19th Ave near Camelback. She followed them to their various locations at other swap meets across the West Valley. And now they've had their very own storefront for just over a year and, yeah, I'm a regular there, too. You'll find us beading, learning, teaching, socializing, and enjoying the day there most Saturdays along with other regular customers, new customers, and Linda and Carol who run the place and set the tone for the inviting, casual atmosphere.  In addition to offering a large variety of beads, beading supplies, wires, findings, and completed jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, earrings, rings, and more), they offer drop-in classes. That's right. No appointments or set times. If they've made a piece you're interested in learning how to make, stop in, purchase your materials, and they'll guide you through the design from start to finish for free. The exception is for wire wrapping classes. Because of the materials involved, there is a $10 fee for that.  Come for the jewelry or the beading, stay for the friendships and a few laughs along the way.

Small restaurant where you wouldn't expect it to be with an equally small menu and a great attention to detail, this is the place for great Italian food in central Phoenix. I've had lunch and dinner here, pasta and flatbreads, and I've never been disappointed. Go on in, sit wherever you're comfortable (inside or outside), and tuck in for a great meal. Other reviews here have details on the food and service, so I'll defer to them. I'm just here to join the chorus singing their praises.

I was hesitant about Rollover since I'd really liked Shine Coffee which was the former resident of this location. Carrying over quite a bit of the wonderfully cheerful and efficient staff, having the same great coffee and tea, and substituting great tasting doughnuts for the great tasting pastries Shine offered works for me.  For the folks complaining about the variety of doughnuts, please take a look at the storefront. It's tiny! How many varieties do you think they can fit on their little counter? As for the people complaining there aren't any doughnuts left later in the day... that would be because their big doughnut business is in the beginning of the day for the breakfast crowd. A couple of doughnuts left over after sitting on the shelf in the display window at the end of the day and they're not fresh? Gee, why could that be?  How about this? Show up early at Rollover, get a doughnut or two (I can personally recommend the chocolate frosted, maple glazed, and maple glazed with bacon), have a big cup of hot or iced coffee or tea, and just relax.  Oh, and as a seasonal (fall) tip, try the pumpkin spice latte with a maple glazed with bacon doughnut. No need to thank me. Just enjoy this perfectly decadent combination.

Can't tell you about the food. We didn't stay long enough to order any. From the pretentiousness of the valet parking (probably due to having to compete with people staying at the hotel next door who don't care where they park) to the ridiculously, overpoweringly loud DJ, to the way-too-hip-hop for it's own good menu, we decided to get out of there while the gettin' was good and before my headache from the pounding "music" gave me a stroke. We may try the Phoenix location at some point, but the Scottsdale location is permanently scratched off the list of places to go.

They claim on the sign on their front door that they have the best donuts in Arizona. They're good, but the best? Not sure I'd be bold enough to make that claim. And the coffee? "Bland" is being generous. Prices are OK, though.  I've been in this particular shop a few times early on weekday mornings and I've got to say I haven't found a single person running the counter who appeared to know what he or she was doing. They've run the gamut from not knowing what the different kinds of donuts are to not having a clue about cash handling and register management.  The place is generally clean, I'll give them that. Sometimes, though, they clean the floor with bleach which leaves it sticky and the bleach smell overwhelms the donut smell. Not a great selling point.  Also, they use a slider lock on one of the front doors. It's installed right under the sign that says that the doors must remain unlocked during business hours which, since the place is open 24/7, is always. Per one of the counter people, that's a directive from the owner. Makes for difficult entry/exit if one person is trying to get out while another is trying to get in. Might also be a safety issue.  The shop is right near ASU's Tempe campus so I'm sure they'll get lots of student traffic especially during non-breakfast hours, and maybe they've got their act together at those times. Seems so from the other reviews. Maybe I'm just being overly cranky first thing in the morning. That's a distinct possibility. Regardless, I'm not impressed and today's visit will be my last. I think I've given them enough chances.
