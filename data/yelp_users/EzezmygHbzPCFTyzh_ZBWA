Absolutely amazing company! Kevin was so attentive, got to work right away & had our sunscreens done & up within a week! Our sunscreens are great quality & look awesome! We also had Kevin do wood blinds in our house, they look perfect! We absolutely love everything this company has done for us. Such a great business owner! Would highly recommend this company to anyone who wants high quality & customer service for a great price. We will send anyone we know that is looking for window coverings to Express Solar! We got quotes from other companies & by far Kevin was the best price & ready for our business!  Thank you Kevin!

My husband and I have been coming here for years, it's our favorite sushi spot. Their fish is always fresh, and great service! We love their list of specialty rolls, lots to choose from! Although some rolls can be pricey, it is always worth it for good fish in your rolls. Their Hawaiian white tuna is one of my favorites (sashimi) and I love their Snow White roll with it too. My go to is always spicy Tuna! This is a great restaurant! Definitely try it out! They have great lunch specials and happy hour too!

WORST BRIDAL SHOP EVER!!!!!!  This company is absolutley horrible! Do not give them any of your money. I am sure they will be out of business soon. Just as MOST of the other reviews on here, I was treated horrible.   My dress was not shipped on time, because they could not afford sample dresses. They held my dress from shipping so they could "negotiate" how many sample dresses they could afford. I ended up recieving my dress over 20 days after it was supposed to ship. I spoke to the manager Rebecca (who was extremely hard to get ahold of) and she told me about the sample dress issue. Of course this was after I was lied to for over a week by her employees. Saying it was delayed because of weather conditions, and it was sent, but had NO tracking number! Rebecca sent me the tracking number as soon as she had it because I wanted proof that it was on its way. UPS attempted to deliver my dress 3 times, but because it was COD they wouldn't deliver it without being paid. Of course Rebecca was "MIA" all week and she was supposed to be the one getting the "check". She NEVER responded to my emails, I was given the email of the owner as well. They never responded to me either. I was lied to, and even hung up on by Cherish.   Being in this industry you would think that they would have better customer service, and better employees. Angel was very nice and apologetic. She should be the manager if you ask me. It is unfair the way they treat their employees, making them deal with unhappy customers while they hide in the background. Buying your wedding dress should be an exciting experience, they completley ruined mine! I wasn't even excited to get my dress, just more RELIEVED that I actually had it!  I never recieved an apology, or offered any compensation whatsoever.  The day I actually got my dress the owner ran in and dropped it off, and ran back to her car before we could even speak to her. Way to manage a business.  If you are in a situation with them, the only way to actually get things accomplished is to go down there and stand in front of them. Although, I'm sure Rebecca or the owners will hide from you.  Bottom line....DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! EVEN IF IT COSTS LESS, IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
