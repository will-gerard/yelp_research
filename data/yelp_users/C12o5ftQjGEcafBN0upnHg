This is definitely one of the largest beading and jewelry making supply stores out here in the valley. The selection is pretty large. The layout has the majority of their products easily seen and easily available. They do have some tables that are full of bins you will have to rummage through to find pieces you want. The back wall is also set up this way with different findings. I come here fairly often when I need some supplies. Their prices are fair, and they are often running sales of 40-50% off their merchandise. They do ask that you leave large purses and bags in lockers, to avoid issues of theft. Since I know this I only go with my purse itself this way I can just tuck it under my arm, since I don't like the idea of leaving my actual bag in a locker.   As mentioned above, the prices are fair for what you find. They carry everything from the inexpensive to semi-precious and precious stones. Those, of course, are pricey.

Definitely has some very unique rolls for people to experiment with. Love coming here, and wish it was closer so I could frequent more often.  The food is fresh, everything is prepared where you can watch them work. Very flavorful, very tender. Definitely the place to go for the the sushi lover.

My son absolutely ADORES this place! There is plenty to do, they have made some good changes to their layout and also their exhibits and play areas if you haven't been here in a while. A lot of hands on activities for the children, and the adults can participate too. Definitely a nice place to let your children explore their creative side in the East Valley.

Beautiful. Serene. Zen. Peaceful. Tranquil. Mindful.  This place could not be more amazing, truly a hidden gem in Phoenix. The garden is beautifully kept, the feeling you get upon being here is that of serenity and being able to be more centered. Stresses leave, and overall you will leave with a more peaceful state of being than before you entered.   The koi are plentiful, and more than friendly. A group of them followed my son, sister and I whenever we were near the water. A group swam close enough for my son to reach down and even gently pet two of them.   This is somewhere well worth visiting, I bought the membership and am excited to have found my newest "happy place," for lack of a better term.

Brace yourself, this is long - but you will want to know this if you are thinking about bringing your child(ren) here.  First visit three weeks ago was actually enjoyable. Yes, the place is dated. Yes, the party and eating area are pretty much trashed from the part-goers and other visitors. Yes, half the token games either do not work at all or randomly decide to eat tokens.  That being said, my son (aged 6 years old), enjoyed the rides and the playground area. That was the focus of our first visit. It was crowded, but my son was able to do all the rides (at least once) during our visit. If the rides were not directly manned, an individual ran up quickly to run the ride for the waiting people.  So why the two stars?  Tonight's visit. Once again, the party area and eating area were a disaster. Games still not working or eating tokens. And almost a twenty minute wait for the amusement rides, with the few attendants present running off even with a line present and leaving people standing there. The manager was far from apologetic about the frustrating situation, and it honestly killed the entire experience to have to explain to my 6 year old multiple times through the night that he could not do the rides since NO employees were present on the floor.  I highly doubt we will return, and it is a shame because the idea behind having a different indoor spot to take him to during the coming summer months would have been awesome.

Extremely over-rated, not at all worth the hype or the price. Would not recommend this place to anyone - unless you are truly desperate to waste your money.

I went here last night with my sister, Tina N. (who also reviewed this place) and our friend Heather. Honestly, the place was wonderful. The atmosphere was very laid back and relaxing - no loud music, very good for conversation without needing to shout to be heard. The waitress was prompt and kept on top of our drinks. We were there for the Happy Hour, which is an amazing deal and it is all fresh and absolutely tender and delicious.  I recommend the Little Mermaid roll for those who like a little bit of a kick and a crunch, and also the Plum Kiss mixed drink if you want something a little sweet. Overall - very clean, very delicious and is now my go-to place for Sushi in DownTown Mesa.  Also, there was no gratuity added to our bill. So I really don't know what the other reviews meant by that.

Took my son and sister here for the first time over the weekend, and the opinion between us is that we don't understand how this place got bad reviews.   We were seated within 5 minutes upon arriving, even though the place was in the brunch hour (11 AM on a Saturday) and fairly busy. The waitress took our drink orders immediately and gave us time to look over the menus. I ordered the NY Strip breakfast, my sister got The Grizz and for my son we got the Mini Volcano off the child's menu. Expecting that the size of the servings here would be about the average of everywhere else, we weren't intimidated by ordering off the Hungry Bear's breakfast. We were quite wrong. We were both shocked and pleased with the very ample serving sizes of everything presented, and the home made quality of all of it. We were certainly left with enough to eat later on in the day!  The hotcakes (pancakes) were amazing, not the microwave reheated mess you typically get at some places. Home made sausages were also tasty. My son actually ate everything without complaint. The steak was cooked exactly as I ordered, and was tender enough to be pulled apart just by putting pressure on the steak with the knife and using the fork to pull the meat. Eggs done perfectly, biscuits were ginormous. My sister held no complaints for her meal, either. She got the 7 grain hotcakes with her meal, and they were actually very tasty and had a pleasant texture.  Our experience was great, service was prompt and friendly. We will be returning, and bringing more people with us.  HIGHLY Recommended.  Enormous portions at amazing prices.

Went here last night, taking my son and mother out for dinner and heard this place was supposed to be pretty good. I feel lied to about that one. First, dirty dishes brought out with the food. Dirty as in caked food very present on them. Second, lack luster appetizers. No really flavor at all. Third, the burgers... I got the mushroom burger, and it was as if they dumped a lukewarm can of sliced mushrooms on top of a soggy, cold burger.  My mother was less than impressed with her patty melt, feeling it was no better than Sonic. Move on to the bathroom. Disgusting. Littered with feminine products. Will NEVER go to another Red Robin after this experience, even if it were free.

The ABSOLUTE BEST Pizza I have had since I moved from New York to Arizona hands down! I love ordering from here. It's the closest tasting to home that I have had in years. Good pizza, good hot subs. Absolutely love that they have eggplant parmigiana heroes, I get one every time. Cannot stress enough how this is the place to get your pizza and heroes from.

This is probably the best find I've made in the last two years.  If you are ever in Mesa, this is the place to go for Indian food that is stellar quality and perfectly done. I've been to places where the focus is just on making your mouth and entire body burn from just the heat of the spice, but not at all flavorful. This is absolutely NOT the case here. There is a good amount of heat to some of their dishes, but it is flavorful and wonderfully balanced.   Service was courteous, friendly and very attentive. Everything tasted fresh, the interior was clean and well kept.

Good coffee, good comics. Everyone that works there was helpful. I also want to point out that they were helpful towards my four-year-old son in helping him see different comics. I've been to other comic and book stores where they just dismissed my son. Not here! Love this little shop.

After some searching on local salons, I decided to give Got Roots? a try.  Could not be happier that I did! I wound up seeing Alex, super sweet and knowledgeable woman. She definitely took the time to make sure that we were both on the same page, that the idea I had in my mind was also in her's. She knew exactly how to cut and style my hair - which being thick/curly/full bodied, it has a life of it's own. The salon itself was clean, up to date in it's products and had a charming boutique atmosphere to it. I went with my sister, and my young son (we came equipped with coloring book and crayons to occupy his time as each of us got our hair cut one at a time) and the other girl their (forget her name, sorry!) seemed very friendly as well. She wound up doing my sister's hair and she also did an excellent job.  Summing it all up.  - Extremely satisfied with the hair cut, service, and atmosphere of the salon. - Will absolutely be returning as long as their doors are open.  Highly recommended!!!!

Came here again after a while, seeking another awesome experience. Alex is no longer working here, so I saw Rachel. Again, completely amazing. She knew exactly how to frame my face and handle my thick/full/curly/wavy ton of hair.  As last time the salon was clean, well kept and stocked. Everything was up to date, the atmosphere was enjoyable and the women who work here are very sweet and personable. Will continue to come here and suggest others do, too!

That the slices are so large, and loaded with toppings (if you decide on them), and the crust manages to remain CRISP is something that should be acknowledged.  No soggy slices! Ever. Been here a couple of times for the lunch specials, and it is easily the best deal you'll get for around $5 - $7, depending on which special you want. The slices are enormous, and the salad is fresh and great - not the standard iceberg lettuce.   Absolutely recommend for a lunch stop (11 AM - 3 PM) if you are in the area. Today me and a girlfriend were able to feed ourselves and our two sons for roughly $25, and there was food left to take home.

Very delighted to have a meat shop and butcher in Mesa! I go here for the meat, specifically the chicken breast. Very fresh, cut to order, and it just absolutely tastes better than what you buy in a local supermarket. Prices are great, too!

Everything is made fresh to order rather than sitting in hot plates waiting to be served, and the portion sizes are intimidating for many of the dishes. Not the typical mall food court place, definitely where I go when I'm here.

Me and my family eat here often. The portions are large, the food is always hot and fresh. This is also the only place I have been to yet since leaving New York that knows the difference between an egg roll and a spring roll. I recommend this place to everyone, and many of my friends have expressed their thanks for the suggestion after they've eaten there.  Appears to be family run, everyone is polite. Only "problem" I ever have is when I phone in the order. The woman who answers is so soft spoken that sometimes it is hard to hear her, but my orders have never once been wrong.

Went here for the first time today, and just hit the drive thru.  I hit the 3 finger box, since I didn't know if the place was any good or not. Surprisingly,  it was better than I guess I had expected it to be. The fingers were large - bigger than most chicken strip you get at most places. Whole white meat chicken, with a crisp and light breading. Everything tasted fresh to me and I will return again.   ALLERGY NOTE: Asked the manager what they fry in, and he said it was a blend of canola and vegetable oil. They do not use peanut oil at all, so according to him there is no worries for peanut allergy sufferers.

Ordered take out from here the other night, and honestly was quite happy with it. It's not true New York styled Chinese, but it is pretty close. Everything tasted extremely fresh, not greasy and was flavorful. My only gripe is that like many Chinese places out here, their "eggrolls" are just spring rolls. Anyone from back East will understand the difference between the two. Will definitely keep ordering from here, and will recommend them out to others. We tried the chicken lo mein, pork lo mein, general tso's chicken and fried rice. Will be trying other menu items in the future.
