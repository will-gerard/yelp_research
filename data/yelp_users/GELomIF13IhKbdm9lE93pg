Every time I come in to pay or to store or remove something from storage I'm greeted with a friendly smile. The staff is exceptional. Great conversationalists too. All employees that is :-). Very clean storage facility. Protected from the elements and cooled. Excellent pricing as well. I would not trust my items any where else. Thank you to all that work there and also keep the place clean and smell free.

Highly recommend this location.  Walked in and was immediately greeted with a smile by Greg. He helped me find the items I needed off the registry and even carried them to the cash wrap. We got to talking about fitness. I finally caved and got the Fitbit (my colleagues will be happy). Purchased my items. Wrapped the present. Had friendly encounters with two other employees. Furthermore we were talking about the recent closures of other stores in this strip mall. Very sad a it reduces business for them and the other few remaining stores. I really hope this bb&b makes it. Very clean store. Welcoming, knowledgeable and friendly staff. Way to go bb&b for hiring such great staff. Will definitely be back.

Excellent venue. Not one bad seat in the house. Brit Floyd night with my niece. Hands down best Pink Floyd tribute band out there!!!!! The sound engineer makes this place sound ALIVE. The band recreates PF with precise instrumental and vocal sounds.  The one drawback I would say about this venue is the carpets walking downs towards the stage from the sound booth. It feels like I step in gum every time I lift my feet. They need to take them up and just have concrete. Other than that again excellent venue

Delicious dive. Beans were spot on. Tacos tasty and full of flavour. Highly recommend. They also have about 8 tables along the side that are covered from the elements. Cash only. Love this concept. :-)

Excellent service. I went to try on swim wear for a pool party. The lady in the fitting rooms Lani (or Lonnie, not sure how to spell it) was honest and went abouve and beyond to be helpful. If something did not look right she let me know. She made a suggestion that looked much better and worked well for me. If only more people were like her at all the shops, the customer satisfaction would drastically increase. I will be a repeat customer of this location because of her. She was also very knowledgable on the entire product line. Way to go VS For hiring one incredible employee.

Best dentist I have had in my 33 years. I have had numerous dentists across 3 states. Clean office. Attentive and friendly staff. Renee is hands down the best hygienist. Dr. Zaina is personal and also takes time with her patients. Each person is treated as an individual not just an income for the office. Have recommended several people to Smiles by Design who have also began to recommend others.

Everyone was very knowledgeable and friendly. Took in my friends pitbull for vaccines and nail trim.  They did not even worry about the fact she was a pit. Many other places have turned us down due to the breed. Highly recommend taking any pet here.

Holly is the best, always pleasant with a smile. She makes my hands and feet look great. The one thing I wish was that they would offer a Dead Sea mani/pedi with Seacret products. I have referred my friends here and they also are pleased with the service. I like the fact they also use fresh tools from a sterilised package not just from the liquid container.

My grams and I have been coming here since I was a very young girl. She likes sharing this Arby's with me when she is on this side of town. When I was little a woman named Penny worked here and she we always so polite. Now as an adult people come and go. Today my grams heard someone ask for a senior discount right after she ordered and paid. They were granted the discount. She asked if it was too late if she could get one and they told her yes it was too late. That is very disappointing. When I worked in food service we would have gladly refunded and then redid the order with the senior discount applied.

Was there on Saturday night with some friends. Excellent Go Go Rice, delish sushi. Just wish they had black napkins for those of us who wear black. We looked like lint catchers when we got up to leave.

Levi was very helpful and went above and beyond to assist me with the lock at the storage unit. He also helped me to put in a few of the items as I was worried they would not fit. He explained everything to me that he was doing before he did it. His pricing was very reasonable compared to other locksmiths I had contacted. Levi arrived in a very timely fashion and got the job done quickly. If ever I need a lock smith again I will certainly call Levi. Honest and hardworking.

The six of us came here after going to Sugar Factory and having a negative experience due to the hostess Hilary to where we could not even dine. The service we are receiving here is excellent from hostess, our server Alicia, bussers, and food. We will come back here next trip which is already scheduled. Atmosphere is great, upbeat. Good mix of music.

Came in for my MacBook Pro. 2011. Very slow, restart needs to be done consistently. Kal came over and assisted me. Turns out I need to update the system as it is moons behind. Since I'm extremely tech challenged, he explained and helped me with everything. Next up asked about my iPhone as it would rapidly change screens and type on its own. Sure enough there was an issue and my iPhone was needing to be replaced. Great experience today.

I went to see Lynyrd Skynyrd tonight. We had cabana seats and VIP pink bracelets. I walked around the entire venue and honestly every place you could be to watch the concert was excellent. Great sound and view from all angles. Highly recommend this venue for all concerts.   I got to the resort early to hang out and gamble a little. While waiting for my friend to arrive I was asking the staff at the front about the concert venue and Erica Perschke was working. I have had her check me in before when I had stayed there. She is extremely friendly and very knowledgable of all things Talking Stick. Another young lady Samantha was also there and just as friendly.   Two things I will say about this resort that should change is the front desk outfits. The outfits are not becoming of any employee or anyone for that matter. Considering this is a resort they should have a more tailored classier looking uniform. Overall though the staff is very pleasant to do business with. The other is the restrooms. The barn style door in the room itself for the restroom had gaps. Talk about no privacy between the restroom and the room itself. Not good!! The waitstaff for room service is pleasant. They come into the room and set the table for you, they also come prepared with your change if you are paying cash.

A group of six of us went in for a fun Vegas dining experience. The girl at the hostess stand Hilary did not greet us with a warm welcome. We then asked if we could sit outside and were advised there was no room. We saw empty tables that would have fit our group had they been pushed together.  When we asked Hilary about that a simple I'm sorry we can not do that would have been much better than the snarky toned "we don't do that." We then were finally seated after 20 minutes and waited a other five before a server even came over. At this point we left and went to Cabo Wabo where we received a much better dining experience.

The place was cosy and had excellent service. Filet was cooked to perfection. Cute baked potato with bacon and excellent flavour. Nice wine selection. Usually I never go for dessert but I could not resist the cheesecake. Would definitely recommend and will be back.

My friend and I stayed here for four days and had breakfast here for three. The food was good all three days. The first day the service was excellent. The lady was very polite and on point. The next two days we came back as we have breakfast vouchers included in our stay. Debra was our server and was ok. At the end she mentioned these vouchers cover everything but gratuity which is appreciated. Of course we are going to leave a tip. Today we had her again and said please don't forget gratuity is appreciated. I find it pretty rude that she has to ask for money especially as the vouchers clearly state gratuity is not included. The first day the lady did not say that and received a generous tip. Debra says this and it honestly makes me not want to tip. I did but was not happy with her. 10+ stars to everyone one else and their attitudes.

Cute little mom and pop place. Friendly service. When my grams and I first arrived the owners parents were sitting and chatting about the Verrazano Bridge in NY. Adorable older Italian couple with NY accents. The server brought out water along with bread and oil with Fresno peppers it in. Spicy but not too spicy. We ordered the lunch special of meatballs and pasta. Our pasta came with a nice little house salad and balsamic. I ordered a coffee and it fresh ground and pressed. The ambiance is quaint with crooner music playing. Delish. Will definitely be back.

We came with a party of approximately 30. The service was semi decent. They were slow. At my table two of us ordered pub steak medium rare and it came out well done like leather and super salty. The chicken on the Gorgonzola salad was dry. The salad had very little dressing and too much lettuce. Guac was ok and salmon was ok. Overall had to drink to wash down the over priced meal.

Good atmosphere, food and drinks. The beef dip and the grilled cheese are delicious. Highly recommend. Love the room service as my beverage of choice. Waiting to obtain game pieces from the hostess stand is ridiculous. Very poor set up for that. Better chances picking up a game with someone already playing.

Thanks to Dan in management and the staff working this evening (27 Feb 2016) I was able to call and have a lovely glass of Prisoner wine and a glass of Coke waiting for my friends on their wedding anniversary. They were very pleased and surprised. It's not much, it's the little things that count. My friends called me to also tell me what a lovely meal they had as well as excellent service.

Talk about class and customer service. Had a bad experience with Camelback Collision and had to take my car to get it repaired at another shop. After a lot of research I decided upon Michael's. What a great group of people. Very knowledgeable and helpful. They explained to me what was wrong and showed me diagrams of what it is supposed to look like. My appointment to get the car repaired is now scheduled. I have the utmost confidence that my car will be in good hands and look like new. Thank you Michael's Collision :-)

A friend of mine wanted to go here this past Saturday night. I was very hesitant as the last time I was there I was on the list and it took over 40 minutes of waiting to get in. This last Saturday my friend knew one of the guys and said we could get in and that it will be immediate. What a crock, we waited over 30 minutes to get in. People were not organized. There was no line, it was more like a crowd of people, pushing, shoving and groping. Once inside its just a crowded mess.   There are way better clubs in Scottsdale that actually have an organized line and staff that run the line. Everyone is better off taking their business elsewhere until they can sort theirs out.  Now if you like being pushed and shoved and groped you might as well bring your own booze and turn the music on your phone on and make the wait a party.

Stopped in to check out the rates for international plans and travel. Was greeted by Daniel immediately upon entry. Had about a 5 minute wait. Daniel went through the plan options and was also able to change my current plan to a less Expensive plan with a better rate. Very pleased with the cleanliness of the store as well as the customer service provided by Daniel.

Came for a friends birthday. Had a 20 top. First off they have the best customer service from the moment you enter the door till the moment you leave. Jake and Evan handled our table and were on point the entire time. Quick, efficient , knowledgable and just a true pleasure to have serving us. Second they have Faygo which is a treasured must for a Midwesterner like myself. We orders all of the appetisers which were excellent in portion size and delicious. Personal fav were the shrimp and gritcake. The perfect amount of spice with the gritcakes too. The craft beer menu has a lovely variety of full bodied to light beers. Will be back for sure. Since I have gluten free friends, they will be able to enjoy dining here too.
