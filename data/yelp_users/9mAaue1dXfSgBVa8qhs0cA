This was the worst gyro platter I've had! The only reason to order from here is because they are open until 2am.  The gyro platter did NOT come with tomato or onion, the pita portion was 1/2 a pita cut into tiny slivers, we got 1 sauce, and the gyro was luke warm and clearly not off of a spiget (it was the frozen pre-cut kind... eww).  I typically order the gyro platter from George's Famous Gyro (Miller and McKellips) and the gyro is hot and fresh and there is enough meat, pita, sauce and sides to feed 3 people - for the same price!  Don't bother, this place is for college kids with late night munchies. period.

Pasties are delicious! The restaurant is very open and comfortable, I recommend sitting on the patio. Great beer selection, Service was great. Definitely recommend

Great new building, same sh*t service and food. Go there for drinks but not if you're hungry. 'Nough said.

Welcome cocktail connoisseurs! This place has an amazing rotation of specialty cocktails and a fabulous selection of spirits - the bar is legit!  The speakeasy decor was awesome (not to mention the bookshelf entrance) and the bar had great energy (good music, just enough people, etc.). In response to previous comments, yes the drinks may take longer to make but these are quality cocktails, not vodka red bulls.  We had a lot of fun and will definitely be back next time were out in Chandler!
