You get what you pay for, which is not much here. The chips and salsa was great, but the entree (tacos and chimichanga) was dry and flavorless.

This Ariba location is not the best option for Mexican food but it's fairly cheap (~$11 dinner plates) and the servers are consistently friendly.   I like that they are open late on Sundays and have decently fast service.

This place is disgusting. There is trash all over the floor and in the bathroom, the trash cans are all overflowing, the baristas are talking loudly and negatively about customers and there is no seating.

Peoria Cafe has a small town diner feel. Good food, decent price, and friendly service.

Order the fries - they come in a tiny shopping cart. Like a fully legit shopping cart with wheels and everything . They tasted pretty good, too.   The Delux burger was flavorful and arrived quickly. They also sell sushi in the evening which was surprisingly delicious. You don't expect great sushi at a burger joint.   Service was good. There is a community table in the middle with cool lights (they were blue tonight - to celebrate Hanukkah?)

By far the best haircut experience I've ever had. Was greeted by Jack as I walked in who asked several questions about my style before cutting my hair. He made a couple suggestions which turned out very well. No wait on this Saturday morning at 9 AM but I've heard wait times can get long later in the day.  I will definitely be returning.

No surprises here. They serve typical Thai food for a reasonable price. The lunch menu (M-F) has huge portions for about $10.   Service was fast and friendly. No complaints.

The atmosphere at Elevate is great for reading, catching up with friends, or listening to live music on Friday or Saturday nights. The coffee is pretty good and the food is on the better end of what you'd expect from a coffee shop.  I would easily give Elevate 5 stars until they changed their WiFi access which now only works sparingly. There is a large common table for working with lots of outlets to keep devices charged, but without WiFi, I've been burning through too much data by tethering my phone. It's not uncommon, however, for a generous patron to set up a hot spot and allow others access, but this shouldn't be necessary.

I didn't think gas stations still charged for using debit. The machine outside wouldn't read my card so after paying inside, the cashier mistakingly charged me $0.55 before accurately charging me $20 for gas plus $0.35 for a debit fee. Disappointing.

I was seen in less than 5 minutes. Doctor was very helpful and asked a lot of questions to make sure he understood entirely what was going on.

The sandwiches and salads are always delicious. The entr√©e option is usually pretty good. The pizza has gotten much better.

Everything I've ordered here has been delicious. The omelets are flavorful and filling. Start looking at the menu before you sit down, because once your waiter leaves your table the first time, he's not coming back. The service is terribly slow, albeit friendly. The food is well worth the wait.

I've always been a fan. Great atmosphere with friendly people at the counter. Brunch is especially good here.   The coffee smell is amazing!  Beautiful outdoor patio that is dog friendly.

Saddle Creek has a great atmosphere for meeting with friends or business associates, studying, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee. Service was friendly and prompt. I ordered an iced coffee which was flavorful and inexpensive.

I've been here twice. Both times the food was delicious. The first visit was for a breakfast on a Sunday morning. The place was packed and the service was SLOW. There were four of us and all of our food came out at different times.   I came back two days later for dinner and the restaurant was much less crowded, the server was very friendly, the burgers were delicious, and the atmosphere was good.   I've heard nothing but good things from others who have tried this restaurant as well.

Excellent service. Great food. I got the Chipotle Chicken Sandwhich. The food arrived in less than 5 minutes and the staff checked on my drink three times during the 20 minutes I was in there.

This pizza place is new so I'm hopeful it will get better as the staff are trained. This is a build your own person pan pizza place with a wood-fired stove. Very similar to Fired Pie.   They charge per topping so be careful not to order too much as the base price is already higher than I've paid at similar pizza shops.   We waited for about ten minutes for our food (which isn't terrible) but since we were sitting on the patio, the staff couldn't find us and gave up until we found our food sitting at the counter inside.   Love the concept of build your own pizza, but with the young untrained staff and high prices, I'm going to stick with Fired Pie for now.
