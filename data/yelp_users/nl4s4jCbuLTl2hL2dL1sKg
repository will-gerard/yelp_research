Way to ruin driving to downtown, do you know how hard it is to navigate those barricades after a long night at Seamus Mccaffrey's or   George & Dragon!? Go home, YOU SUCK.

Amazing.  a. If you impress me with a chicken breast you are doing a DAMN good job.  b. Spanish plate with Manchego, Serrano, date-bread and all types of other goodness = epic. c Basil and gin martini, wtf so odd but awesome... and i hate gin! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hU6sN5r6vayqm_RMgvPGOQ?select=1641PJE2BHJbwTD1t6z2PA d. Todd and the nice manager lady, both good peoples.  c. Did i mention AMAZING chicken breast, yes i am actually raving about CHICKEN... granted chicken with lemon piccata, capers, arugula, and home made 'gnocchi' which were more like a pretzel bread than a gnocchi but none the less amazing. d. OH and pumpkin bread pudding... wow.. effing wow.   Go for the page-long cheese menu and affordable yet varied wine selection.  I can not believe this place has been here for five years and i just now visited it. The Spanish plate, two cocktails, two glasses of wine, two entrees and a desert was only a bill... cant get that in LA.

Like an old friend with an open door and a warm hug G&D is always there to feed you while getting you pleasantly sauced. The servers, by definition, are dark haired, tattooed sirens aloofly peddling the classic English fair.  The bangers and mash is enough for two, the fish 'n chips are decent but not great and if nothing else it is great that both are under ten bucks. Drinks are decently priced and they have real gingerale. (mhhh wiskey ginger) The owner either used to do tons of coke or still does because he is always frenetically bouncing around the bar talking a mile a minute to his regulars. I have been here on new years, week nights, weekends and anything in between; it is always good times. I believe there is even a lightrail stop right outside.  If you haven't been this is a must for any hardcore AZ pub-crawler.

One of the best 'za joints in the PHX.   No corkage and BYOB so the pizza wont be the only thing that is deliciously sauced... cheesy... my pun not the pizza... well the pizza too.   Both the thick crust and thin crust are amazing, i prefer the thin. Large sausage, onions, and shrooms with a few cheap bottles from Safeway across the street = a night of fun for all your friends.  I have NO idea what people are hattin' on the 'nato's for, it is nearly perfect pizza. They also have great huge grilled sandwiches and fresh salads.

I have been eating at this venerable PHX landmark since i was in wonzies... okay so that may have explained my burgeoning childhood obesity. I dont care, layer on the calories, this place reminds me of everything i love about America and Phoenix. I doubt i could feel more comfortable than sitting with a cold one, wings and a chk cheese steak (mushrooms, onions, sweet/hot peppers and ex cheese please) watching some sports at uncle sams. I really think this place maintains an elite status as my best hoagie ever. Statement. Do yourself a favor, go, get a cheese steak, wings and maybe some pizza. Oh and the waitress which range from haggered to hot wear tiny skirts, dinner and a show baby.

How has one of the best sandwich joints in AZ only been reviewed 3 times!? Come on AZ Yelpers, get up on your grind, yo.  I crave these sandwiches, i miss them, i pine over them, they haunt me at every turn. They are that good.  First visit - Cheese Steak - Oh my god, never been to philly but i hope they are this good there. The bun, the meat, the cheese, the veg; all perfect.   Second Visit - The bobby - what... wait, a sandwich with Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, and Mayo!? That is practically a thanksgiving leftover sandwich all year around, does it get better than that!?  Third Visit - Eggplant Parmesan - Holy crap it is the size of my head and oozing everywhere. Mhhh bready eggplant, cheese and sauce, the trifecta of tastebud tantalization.   This place is a must for all AZ sandwich aficionados, be warned tho they are HUGE so bring a friend... if you don't have friends try showering because you probably smell.

If Teds existed in the burgeoning void of sanity that is know as Los Angeles it would be called Pinks and people would wait in lines around the building for two hours to eat here.  Thank Christ it doesn't because you can stroll right in, order two split grilled dogs, rings and a coke, pay ten bucks and feast till you are in a food coma. Teds is seriously one of the better charbroiled grills i have been to, it can get a little busy but it is worth ANY wait.  They have all the fixins, mustard, onions, peppers, relish, mayo... pretty much anything you could ever want your porky goodness to swim in.

Come here for brunch or early lunch otherwise you will be singing the same woes of all the other 1-3 star Yelpers. I mean how can you really hate a place that had 1/2 price bottles of wine, i mean i guess you could if you were one of those "McCain-loving-obama is a socialist-there is no parking for my H2" type people but i personally appreciate cheap stuff.  The best way to do my florist is as follows... Roll out of bed on a Sunday, it's 10am, your head is pounding and you cant think straight. Stumble to the bathroom, clean up, cover up last night's hair with a hat, don some big sunglasses, pick up friends and head to Florist. Order a mimosa, drink it, and order a bloody marry. (best around) Okay, you are starting to feel human again, execute stage two; biscuits and gravy OR if last night was particularly rough stick with eggs on toast. Continue with afore mentioned drinks and mastication until all is right in the world.   Look this is not an amazing restaurant but it is GOOD. They always have discounted drink specials or cheap wine, the food is consistent and service is the best if you sit at the bar.  For dinner make sure to get the breads with herbed butter and the cheese plate. Sandwiches are no Pane Bianco but they are all pretty solid with the Turkey and Brie being my standby.   I am sorry but what is wrong with the piano lady covering current hits with a jazz inflection, if you want Brahm's 9th Symphony go somewhere other than a trendy cafe, Jesus. It is klitchy and gets her tips, calm down fancy pants, it is however true it can get loud in the seats right by her.  Oh... the bathroom is completely private and shwankily candle lit... so ah... yea. Watch how much you drink and who may or may not be pulling you into said den of inequity for covert lip-locking

If you cant get down with fresh made Italian bread, hand cut meat, evoo, creamy mozzarella, and some spices then stay away from Calabria because that means more for me.  Owned by a very sweet Italian couple this is a lowkey downtown lunch spot that has never disappointed me. They are by no means a full service grocery but do have sparse but unique grocery items that you wont find at your neighborhood Fry's.  I have mainly stuck with the Caprese sandwich in the past but sometimes i get crazy and add salami or prosciutto.  Can't vouch for the pasta other than that it is made on site, seriously though who needs pasta for lunch anyways, it is a deli, nuff said.

I have been eating here since i was shitting my diapers, that is many moons of Mexican goodness.  Los is no revelation to the cuisine of Mexico but is without a doubt solid, fresh, and tasty food. If you go for breakfast the Huevos are pretty epic, if it is lunch make sure to get the huge cheese crisp slathered with fresh guac. Everything else is completely solid but traditional for American Mexican food. They make there own fresh tortillas which are delicious.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME, BEER BATTERED FRIES!? This is exactly what Delux would look like if it were owned by Nascar fans and not by Tennis fans.  While the big 'D' had some epic sweet pot fries the reg-shwag-reggie-dime bag fries are seriously lacking compared to the crispy beer battered godliness that is the fries of Wineburger.  The WB is one of the most relaxing, down to earth places to have a quiet lunch, you will feel like you are eating in your own living room. There is plenty of beer, including the gold standard PBR, nothing compliments a million calorie meal like a ice cold $1 Pabst. True to name the incredible burgers are cooked perfectly in red wine and served on a crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside bun. It helped that this was right near my old house but even if it wasn't i would have traveled far and wide for Wineburger's fries and beefy goodness. Also they have a full service bar, pool, and darts... good stuff.

I like to think i am a pretty classy guy who doesn't objectify women... wait i am writing a review for a strip club... shit.  Seriously tho i don't go to titty bars often and if i do it is generally post break up for a friend.  None the less, last time i was in AZ my  friend decided we should have a revival of our younger days and  visit the site of many debaucherous nights, good old ABC.  As we paid to get in some 6'5 drunk guy who had been cut off tried to rush back in to the 21+ side and was lifted up and slammed to the ground by a 5'5 skinny bouncer, instantly swarmed by 5 other bouncer guys, beaten to a bloody pulp, and drug out by his feet to bleed on the side walk unconscious, all within 2 ft of us. AWESOME way to start the night. I have heard stories of blackjackings and pistol whippings by the security also, i mean realistically what goes better with T&A then some senseless violence!?  I mean for me that says it all. That and you can drink and see naked women all in one venue, oh and bush dives. If you don't know i'm not explaining.

Why can't you have an LA location?! I seriously lay awake at night craving your three elusive salsas and undeniably perfect chili quiles.  I have spend many moons in rural mexico, mexico city, and tehuacan; nothing reminds me of my time south of the border more than Parrilla's Mexico city cuisine.  What you must try... chili quiles - best ever, just epic cheesy chips, sauce and goodness. tacos - all there meat is chargrilled with a little bacon, peppers and onions. amazinggggggg Chuleta Suiza - a real version of a quesadilla, there is something about the flavor of the pork and the cheese they use that makes me weak in the knees.   Really any of the dishes they serve on a grill - Parrillada de Pollo and my fav ... Platillo Mixto con Bisteck - Melted cheese with chorizo and grilled peppers topped with avocados, served with two charbroiled beef tacos. agggghhhhhhhh  Oh my god i cant even take reviewing this place, i am slipping into deep depression knowing i have to wait until Christmas to eat here again... oh the humanityyyyyy... btw the service is either amazing or sucks horribly but once that sauce hits your mouth (dirty) you wont care if Hitler just brought you more chips. OHHH and make sure to get a Cadillac Marg, combined with a full meal  it has been known to educe a happy coma.

In high school did you ever have a friend of the opposite sex who you were platonicly close with but then lost contact with post-high school only to see them years later and they are completely grown up and boneable? Yesterday's visit to LPS was just like that, the poorly presented delicious Mexico city Mexican food of my youth has been transformed into well plated, incredible tasting fare. LPS has some of the BEST salsa, ever, a spicy blended red, a tamatillo/avo green, and a mixed pico. I had the pork flat tacos with a side of the chilaquiles. (greatest dish ever, ench sauce, cheese and chips baked together... kind of like a mex baked ziti actually) The roomies had chk enchiladas and beef tacos, both were spectacular. The service is really hit or miss, our server couldn't split the check to save his life and spoke little English but it could have been worse.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw?select=h_wy_MqnFW0L397uYsQOig http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw?select=1UOxVH3vvYGkwv7HZ_H8Cw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw?select=ryVQVqRPyJylpYzi-XZezQ

Have i mentioned this is my favorite Mexico City Mexican food joint?! W/out a doubt consistent, fresh and cheap. Whenever i am in AZ this is my spot.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw?select=9vEQ2jKcRGjryTyVEvZDmA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw?select=w1hAI5b7FWBJ1WNQzRpplg

From what i hear this was one of Sammy the bull's Italian watering holes and is still frequented by the AZ underworld, that is enough of a ringing endorsement for me... a compliment guys, don't wack me. Short of looking to your right and seeing Tony Soprano and the sign changing to Vesuvios this is the closest to an Italian-movie experience you will have. Complete with tables being pulled out, terse yet endearing fat men barking "what cha want to drink", and INCREDIBLE Italian food. Two words, Chilean Sea Bass... three words i guess. It is served SWIMMING in garlic and butter over a bed of linguine. It is so tender it falls apart just watching you pick up your fork but beware of the killer garlic breath that will ensue once you have licked your plate clean. By no means cheap but worth every penny. Cannelloni, salad, parm ... amazing, i have never had a bad meal here.  I will be stopping by when i am home for xmas, it is that good.

Only delux could make me want to be a homeless shopping cart man lugging my overflowing carts of spoils from place to place. I mean... homeless people's carts are full of the best sweet potatoe fries ever also, right? The spicy sauce that comes with them, amazing.... mouthwateringly amazing.    Service is always hit or miss, one star gone for that but for the food here i would suffer far worse than pretentious scottsdaleyians that think they are above slangin' burgers.   So i like to drink martinis, dirty, Chopin, and shaken hard.  Our server returns to our table with a shaker and glass, she shakes it, pores it filling my glass to the lip, and leaves the shaker which is still full of booze. WTF are we in a dinner and i just got a malt!? How awesome is that, makes the $14 price tag much less painful.   Burgers... amazing. Red meat at its pinnacle. Beet salad is great also. Do yourself a favor and get a Rogue beer on tap, this is one of two places in AZ i have been to that carry them. I love delux, it is trendy and pretty much SUCKS unless you sit on the patio but the pros far outway the cons.

Dear Green House  Ahhhhh Fox Concepts, how you woo me with your impeccably designed restaurants and local/delicious fair. I miss you, there is nothing quite like you here in puffed-up LA. You were so unpretentious but at the same time completely gourmet. The thought of your cheese plates, Braised Short Ribs, or Calamari make my loins ache with fiery longing. The memories we shared, my first sip of Orogeny, oh how time flies. Alas i must go but you shall always have a place in my heart... and stomach.   Sincerely Yours, Matthew  P.S. You lost a star for how you milked my wallet you fickle mistress. I love you though, you were worth every penny.

This was actually my second time eating at the big 'C'(mind out of the gutter), i had been here a good 2-3 years ago for dinner. One of the first things about Cibo that draws you in is the expansive patio with benches, fire pit, and tables for service. I imagine that the fire pit and benches come in handy on a busy Friday night while you swill some wine waiting for your table. My man-date and i had stopped by the vintage craftsman home that is Cibo for a Friday lunch anticipating pizza-y goodness... nope, sandwiches and salads only for lunch.  Alright, we are big boys, no crying, suck it up, roll with the punches.  Sadly to say after perusing the sandwiches and salads i wasn't overly excited about anything, it was all a pretty much boring standards.  That isn't to say it didn't sound edible but i honestly expected a little more than the standard Prosciutto and Motz sandwiches of any Italian deli. I settle the PLT but with added Motz (BLT but Prosciutto instead of bacon) and my buddy got the Pastrami. If nothing else Cibo has amazing bread, everything else was a little boring.  The bell pepper aioli vaguely smelled like anchovies which freaked me out but i decided to eat it anyways, i am still feeling okay hours later as i write this, don't worry. The salad that came with was tasty but i could have done with less pine nuts/garnish and more attention to the sandwiches.  Nothing was terrible but i don't think i would ever rush back to eat lunch, i think i am going to try and do dinner later this week before i head back to CA but it might get passed over for Spinatos or Bianco. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw?select=pxm0cOIoLBj5CGjYAvw8Lw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw?select=hd-s0jAenKqoNg-hUqnPMQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw?select=z63anYfNP879CV749HlyNg

I haven't been here in a long time but i can still safely tell anyone NEVER GO HERE.  I had been looking forward to eating here for weeks before hitting the strip and had looked through their website to figure out what i wanted. (i am that cool) Upon arrival i figured out what i wanted based on my site perusing, the same things were on their site as the physical menu. When the food came out it was completely different than what was on the menu, i had my heart set on what was described and what I got was completely different. When i tried to send it back the server gave me incredible attitude saying they had recently switched sides even after i had specifically made sure they had what i wanted.  Eventually he begrudgingly sent it back and brought me something else that was actually pretty good BUT flash forward an hour... the person i was with magically passed out stone cold, like had to be carried to the cab passed out,  all we drank was a bottle of wine and two lemonchellos for desert.(we're drinkers, that was nothing)  If it had been the wine i would have been similarly affected, the only thing it could have been was the lemonchellos as they were separate glasses and served after i complained. The next day she was sick and shaky ruining the rest of the trip. Apparently girls get randomly roofied in Vegas all the time (like that makes it normal or okay?!?!) but needles to say i went and had a very friendly chat with the server the next day I could say that i wont let a rotten apple spoil the bunch but between menu inaccuracies and them hiring a scumbag douche who would pull that shit i will never eat here again especially at a one-two bill price tag.

Ceviche, wings, rosat corn pizza... drooooool.   I have eaten here four or five times and can not find ANYTHING to complain about. Service is constantly spot on, food is always good/consistent, and i LOVE sitting at the bar.  I have to agree with Tee D, when i am home for the holiday i will probably feel myself gravitating towards LGO before i brave the hours of wait and hassle at Bianco. It really honestly is just as good but without all the hullabaloo.   They did have a white sangria that was... white (no one told us) and kind of gross but who cares, the mouth watering quality of everything else made that a minor footnote in our dinning experience. Also The gladiator and the padre deserve honorable mention behind my roast corn 'za, all incredible pizzas.

Who doesn't love Matt, what a great guy. Whether this dude is slangin' hash and eggs or amazing beer and snacks everything he touches seems to be delicious. The snacky items are all unique/fresh, they amazing selection of beer freakin' rules (who has Rogue Beers on tap, this guy does), and the place is shwag as hell. Great downtown place to take a date, low light always makes me look better, you might be better looking.  If you like beers off the beaten path and a shwanky place to drink them this is it.

Again, i can not believe there are only three reviews of this place, what are you Phoenicians doin and why does it not involve adoring this place.  It is in Fountain Hills which is almost worth a deduction of a star but i guess i can get over that, it is phoenix, you can get anywhere in 25 minutes. From the outside it has a pretty awkward location, tucked in some business park, but once you are inside it is a decently decorated restaurant. The patio is the best part, comfy and you can watch the fountain go off.  They used to have a calamari app that was some of the best i had ever had but according to the site, no longer. The sea bass is spectacular, well paired with risotto and ratatouille.   They have a smattering of flat breads that are all pretty great for lunch, not so much for dinner. I am going to go back to AZ in a few days and will def stop by to try the steak fritte (truffle frittes, eff yea!) If you ever feel like a drive or are in the area this place is great, if it were in Scottsdale it would rival any Fox Concept Restaurant and is just generally awesome.

Anyone who doesn't like willow house should be taken out back and shot... or at  the every least bared from ever returning.  In the world of impersonal bravia-venti-tazo-breve-who-gives-a-fuck-shit-tasting trendy coffee slung by people who don't know the difference between drip and press an independent art house-esque bohemian bastion of sanity serving great coffee should be lavished with praise. I can not tell you how many nights i have spent here, at least once a weak for open mic night at which the young Dylans of the phoenix music scene would come to play song after song to a packed room. Now this was no "Lilith Fair woman singing about her blooming flowers" open mic night but rather a collection of some of the more talented artists not signed to record labels. Itunes Andrew Jackson Jihad, an amazing indie band no one has heard of and they would always be there to melt our faces with folksy goodness. There was local art and handmade products for sale everywhere, some nights they would screen movies, you could curl up in the dark with some tea and a cute girl watching a good flick.  Some of my better phoenix memories are found here accompanied by close friends immersed in the closest i have come to being part of any "art scene."  Willow literally embodied the bohemian spirit or as close as anything can come in our corporately mandated times, I am not sure if it moved or closed but it wouldn't be the same even if i tried to go back anyways, you cant ever go back.
