Great spot for a quick lunch. There is only seating available outside, so the summer months may not make this an ideal spot. The burritos are huge, too! Get the green chili burrito mixed with beans enchilada style...trust me..it was a great suggestion .passed on to me.

For my boyfriend's 27th birthday I wanted to take him to a nice steakhouse. He suggested Rustler's Rooste as a nostalgic visit. As a kid, he remembers frequenting the restaurant to celebrate anniversaries, weddings and good company. I was very excited to take him to the restaurant for that purpose and it would be my first visit there. It will also be my last. When I arrived, a dead fly was on the salad plates that are on the table. When I told the waiter, he seemed rather unphased by the occurrence. I also asked that he provide straws for the water. After being away for some time, he arrived with our drinks and a small kids cup that held the straws. When I picked up the cup, I looked inside to find it was coated with what appeared to be paint chippings and dirt. It was like he grabbed the cup from the back of a dense closet.  Our food arrived, but was left by the cook and we waited for our waiter bit to arrive and serve. I ordered the swordfish and it was very chewy. The steak was okay, certainly not worth the price. My boyfriend had the chicken- he was pleased with the barbeque, but the green beans were cold. The cowboy beans provided tasted like ketchup and pepper, absolutely horrible.  I never received a refill, but our waiter was hard to find. He was pretty clueless. I think that reflects more on the restaurant than his skill sets.  When we left it was a relief. The only reason I will go back is if I am asked to participate on Restaurant Rescue, or to save my unborn child's life.

Wow! I am floored by the service! From setting up an appointment, to return time to get my car back . . . great, great, great! An individual rear-ended my car and did some damage to my quarter panel and alignment. The estimate was quick and painless. I set up a time to have the car fixed. When I dropped it off, the receptionist contacted Enterprise and explained Invision would contact me with updates. Jim would contact me to let me know there was more damage and they needed to send another quote. I never felt out of the loop. But, the results for the car were unbelievable! They washed my car, vacuumed it out . . . smelled like a brand new car! I am so pleased with the results. These guys are great. Now, I certainly don't want to have to visit them again because that would mean I would need some car repair..but they would be front runners for any type of aesthetic repair. Thank you so much Invision!!

I can count on one hand how many times I have been to Old Chicago. In fact, I can count on two fingers how many times I have been to Old Chicago.  The most recent time will be my last. Our server was rude, forgetful and unorganized.  I wanted to take advantage of the reverse happy hour, as well as my friends. We had a few questions about the menu and specials. However, our waiter didn't want to answer many of the questions and made us feel like an inconvenience. Once we placed our order, we waited for over 30 minutes for it to arrive. When the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm, overcooked and tasted like bad leftovers. My friend received the wrong soup, which I wasn't too surprised as the waiter was clearly not paying attention to anything when we let him know what we would like.  After requesting the right soup, we waited another 20 minutes for that until the waiter showed up and asked if we would like tequila shots. Uhm... No tequila shots-- just the right soup please. Mind you, this was second time he asked if we wanted to buy shots. Are you a When the soup arrived it looked like baby food. bartender? What is this place? Stop the world!! I want off!!  The waiter didn't remove the soup from the bill, he was clearly frustrated as we requested our checks immediately.   Bad food. Bad service. Bad tip. Bad restaurant.

I stopped in the salon while my car was being serviced. It is a clean and I was quickly assisted. I was happy with the attention to detail for my manicure and loved that they allowed me to sit and relax for my pedicure. I hate when I go to other salons and they start the pedicure before I am really settled.  I will be a returning guest for sure!

I am surprised at some of the low reviews for this place. Since moving to Gilbert, I rave about Bagel Nosh :) It is probably the best place for bagels and the service is fantastic! Recently, I took my boyfriend there and he quickly understood why this is my new addiction. The staff is friendly and the Honey Walnut on French Toast- to DIE for!! Love this place!

Pleased with the work and the level of friendly customer service I received at American Five Star.  The mechanics were quick with the repair and kept me informed of the work as best possible throughout the time my car was there.  The prices are reasonable and certainly on the affordable side when I price matched.

A few girls from work suggested we eat at Cibos for lunch. I was a bit hesitant because I am not crazy about Italian food. But, after eating at Cibos I wanted to live there. I wanted to eat everything and proclaim of its awesomeness to the world. Instead, I decided to write a great review. Great selection for lunch, quick service and the taste was out of this world. I tried a Salsiccia sandwich and angels sang when I started eating. Or maybe that was me...because it was AWESOME!!! I will be frequenting this place all the time. I may just try to live there....it is that good!

Joe's Real BBQ is a great! Agreed, the menu options are not vast, but the choices they do provide are spectacular!  The prices are affordable, I was hesitant at first thinking the extra side here and there would make the meal costly, but two of us were beyond content with about $15 a person. This of course was with dessert, can't skip that :)  I recommend the pulled pork and the lemon cake or pecan brownie for dessert. Just a suggestion, the brownie would be GREAT with some bourbon!   Check Joe's REAL BBQ out for a nice atmosphere and delicious food!

Lunch time specials are really great and affordable. The food arrived fast and the presentation was clean and appealing.  The sushi is great!! While I order the orange chicken and it was delicious, it was hard not to be jealous of my co-worker eating the yummy sushi!! Fresh, flavors on point and nice portions.  Try this out for lunch and you wont be disappointed!

This salon has since changed its name to Rio Nail Spa. i have been to the salon a few times and can attest to the following:  --rarely a wait for any service --pedicures are good, the new water tubs are nice and the chairs are functional --friendly staff...not the boss though  however.... --my shellac started to peel after a week. I went in to see what could be done because i did pay a good price for the service. Note that I do not nor did I not peel my nails. They started to peel on their own and I noticed this when I was in the shower and it was getting caught in my hair. When I showed him my nails (four peeled off) he immediately assumed I wanted a refund or correction. He yelled at me in front of the other customers and said 'people like me are bad for businesses.' I was so shocked I really didn't know what to say. It was not only unprofessional on his part, bit it had to make the other patrons uncomfortable as well. I tried to explain the peeling was not due to me, but he wasn't allowing me to explain. After a few more seconds of abuse, I left very disheveled.  I hope such an experience is not replicated in the future. I am still in shock as I write this review. No doubt there are other salons in Gilbert with kinder managers and willingness to correct mistakes.

It is a tradition for my boyfriend and I to take each other to a nice dining restaurant to celebrate birthdays. A few friends recommended City Hall for a nice, romantic dinner. I made reservations using Open Table and noted the special occasion. We were promptly seated upon our arrival and the ambiance was pleasant. There was a small band alongside a piano player playing top chart music and provided a great relaxed atmosphere.  Our food was great and came out piping hot! We each had the fillet- cooked EXACTLY as we ordered...which is always a plus by me. Also, we split the macaroni and green beans. For dessert, we were treated with a birthday butter cake with a rich and decant ice cream...that alone would have been a great treat on its own.   The only small "complaint" I have is the wines. Two weeks ago I bough the "Crush" Dreaming Tree Wine for 15.00 at Frys...it is a great smokey, red blend. But, the bottle was $40 on the menu. What is the difference? Will the wine bottle at Mastro's make me poop gold eggs? If so, I'd buy it...otherwise...no thanks.  Above all ...the service was fantastic! I really appreciated the quick response to fill my drink and provide recommendations.   Great time to celebrate my wonderful boyfriend's day of birth.

My boyfriend and I frequent this place at least twice a month for Sunday brunch. The service is great. One recommendation is I clarify with the waiter if the whole menu is considered brunch, or just the too menu items. I say this because our first few times we were told the whole menu is considered brunch and this comes with a complimentary alcoholic beverage.  I tell all my friends about this place and we have brought many to dine there as well. Without a doubt, one of my favorite restaurants!

I would rather have Lucky Boy Burgers than the finest steak in Phoenix. The wait is short and the prices are beyond reasonable. I have rarely paid more than $8 for burgers, fries and a soda. Seriously, it is the best. Get the 1000 Island burger with cheese and prepare to have your tastebuds singing praises.

Since we moved near the Higley Hot Dog Hut and I have been itching to try it. My favorite quick meal is hot dogs. I would be okay eating a hot dog everyday.   When I called to see if they were open the lady that answered said, "we are open until 4:30 pm today, but do not come a few minutes before then because we won't be able to serve you." It was a little off-putting. I was a bit confused, but did understand her point. She proceeded to say, "I mean we are ready to leave at 4:00 to be honest." I appreciate you honesty and I understand the subtext of the comment, but as a person that has worked customer service for 12 years, this is the one thing I have always been told not to say to customers.  I ordered two chili cheese dogs: one with sauerkraut and one with sauerkraut and onions. When I got home, that is not what I received. One was just a chili dog with sauerkraut and the other was a dog with relish. The person before me ordered two plain dogs with ketchup. I'm not sure where the mixup occurred.   The dog itself was good. The chili was decent, pretty sure it's from a can but no points deducted for this.   Overall the service is quick. I was pleased with that. I would be willing to give three stars, but I can't justify a wrong order for that. Also, the initial impression for customer service was off-putting.

Cornish makes my tummy and heart happy!  I stopped in after looking at wedding dresses for a close friend of mine (always a bridesmaid..never a bride. . . ) and this place made me feel less depressed and likely to spend my life alone... because...  The food will make you forget it all! Feed your face and feed your feelings! I had never heard of a pasty before coming here and this is what has been missing from my life.  I don't need a boyfriend any longer . . . I can get a Shepherds pie to keep me safe and warm. Need someone to make you feel loved and wanted? Pssh..forget that...shove your pie hole with a pasty--and then make it a pasty hole! Try the Tikka Masala and then change your last name to Cornish Pasty-Tikka Masala.. no one will question you ...because they know you found what is right in the world.  Feeling a little tied down? Try Reuben.. he's so good and filled with pastrami and can take you to the 1000 Islands. . . he's like an ugly fat man but rich so he's a bit more attractive. But, certainly delicious.  Want to get a little freaky? BANGERS and MASH! It's like a threesome in you mouffff! Do it!!  Go to Cornish Pasty! Seriously!!! Go and find that special pasty..that special something to make your soul feel good again.

Mountainside is the first and only gym I have joined since moving to Arizona. The location for me was hard to beat-- I can walk to the gym if I want.  The classes are the best feature. Zumba and Hip Hop are fun and engaging, all levels are able to attend. Muscle class is great and I love to learn new ways to target certain zones. Tabata and HIIT are killer!! Talk about sweat! Every time I leave i have to wipe up a pool from my area...it's gross, but it's effective. The only bad thing about these classes is my fear of using the bathroom (squatting is no fun!!!).  The price is a bit more compared to other gyms, but it is a great bargain for the cleanliness and helpful staff. You do have a maintenance fee (I think it is about $35) to pay a year. I will say that my boyfriend and I signed up at different times, and each time they did not tell us about this feature. It wasn't a big deal to us, the gym sends you a reminder and then some coupons after. The first year we signed up had some great coupons, like free shakes and tanning. Unfortunately, this year, while they offered the same, the limit was much less. I am not sure if that is because it was our first year....but I was a little bummed :( Not enough to stop going, however. Police and military receive a discount and you can freeze your account. I am sure there are stipulations on the last, but I don't know all the deets.   I suggest trying Mountainside! It's a great atmosphere!

Like many individuals, I purchased a Groupon for acrylic nails after moving to the Gilbert area. I am a girl who enjoys a bargain, but when I arrived to LaVie, I did not see a value savings for the services. After I made an appointment, I had to wait an additional 20 minutes before anyone assisted me. The gentleman that placed my nails was . . . okay. He was fast, so that made up for the time that I waited and I appreciate that. However, the lady next to me continued to have difficulties with her fill in and they started to refuse to fix the nail until she said she would not pay for her services. Also, the inside was dark and drab. There was a strange smell in the building as well. My nails did not last as long as I am typically used to with acrylics. Overall, I was not impressed. I have found better Nail Spas in Gilbert that I will be frequenting. Unfortunately, I have told others not to go to LaVie.

A few co-workers and I took a gamble on Los Portales and the odds were not in our favor from the beginning.   Save your money and appetite and kindly write this off as a place to try for lunch.  Before we entered the building, we should have known it would be a bad experience. The place is empty at noon. We were the only guests there the entire lunch hour. When you come in you are greeted by a waitress and what smells like a urinal cake. It's not very strong, but I can only guess it is from the products used to clean. Which is on the plus side, I suppose.  What is with the windows? Why are they spray painted? It's eerie. Spend a few $100 and get them tinted.   The food is meh and overpriced. There is no lunch menu options and it is so dark inside the building that it takes some time to read the menu. Does this say tostada or taco? I dunno! Just make your best guess.  Oh, and once you figure out what you do want to order, it may not be available. For example, a fish tostada... nope sorry we don't have that. May I have onions on my tostada? Oh, no. Sorry, we don't have onions either. May I have sour cream on my dish? Uhh... let me check.   Aside from all of that, you have to pay with a debit card for your meal. Then the waitress is looking at you and asks, "How much is Tip?" It's just an awkward experience.   If I could use the thumbs down emoji I would. I wish I could write my meal off as a taxable donation, because I certainly wasn't satisfied Los Portales. My wallet and stomach are disappointed.

This was my first time trying Lebanese cuisine and it was a great place to have my first experience. Hands down, the hummus was perfect. The others at my table agreed, we would smear the hummus on anything and everything because it is so tastey. My fiance and I shared the chicken and beef schwarma and the dish did not disappoint.  The group also had a few appetizers and they came out fresh and nicely displayed, and it was a great introduction for our meal. My favorite was the Turkish Coffee. It was divine and a true treat to have.  I will certainly visit this restaurant in the future.

I had a great experience at Valley Women for Women. My PA was phenomenal!! I am so glad I switched to this provider as my previous OB GYN was very brash. Heidi listened to my concerns and gave me great advice and options. That is what I like about medical care, give me options and let me choose based upon my lifestyle. The wait was much shorter given the amount of people (and babies!!) that were waiting. I was in and out in an hour and I was a new patient, to me that is great service.  While I am never excited about my annual (what lady is?) I feel confident I chose the right provider for my health needs.

This is my first time coming to Native after the logo has changed ,but the second time overall. My first experience was repeated this next go around. . .  Positives: 1. The restaurant was clean and considerably "busy" given it was a Tuesday night and no football . . . to my knowledge . . . was on. 2. Our waiter was friendly, when he showed up. I'll give this a pass as he seemed to be the only one working. 3. This is an odd positive but i do enjoy booth seating where the booths are large enough to fit more than four people. While that was not needed this time, it was a mental note I made if I come here with a softball group or a impromptu gathering.  Negatives: All of it was related to food . . . 1. Food was cold. 2. The wings were smothered in wing sauce. Which is usually a complaint I have, but the sauce was cold. 3. The beer tasted flat. I am not sure if that was the problem of the restaurant or the brewery but the Kilt Lifter tasted like it had been there for several weeks.  4. The wrong food came out. . . we didn't say anything to our waiter because we couldn't locate him most of the time, but I doubt the correct order would have been any different as most of it was cold.  This just isn't going to be a place I want to frequent. Maybe if I am super hungry and there is minimal wait, other than that this place is pretty forgetful.

I am hooked on Treehouse Bakery! A few co-workers introduced me to this quaint, little bakery that is easily accessible. The inside is adorable and proudly displays local art and other Mom & Pop shops.  Do not be discouraged by the vegan focus here people! The cupcakes are wonderful and filled with love. The owners are very friendly and proud of their product. As they should be: talk about delicious! My favorites: churro, banana foster and a latte-flavored indulgence.  Try this place!! You'll come back again and again!

Since moving to Arizona, I have not found a Sushi place that compares to Sushi San. I absolutely love their service. I talk this place up like you will crap gold nuggets after eating! You will have to eat there to see if it is true :) Sushi is fresh,  the service is beyond spectacular and friendly. If I do not eat here at least once a month, I crave it. Sushi San is the best place to eat!

There's simply just not enough staff to accommodate the customers. The line inside is just as long. The app deposit function isn't working so thus to the bank I go. Only one lane is open and the tellers are doing the job of five.

After a few unsuccessful visits to other Nail Spas in Gilbert, I am pleased with 4D nails. They were busy on a Sunday afternoon, but moved many of the customers rather quickly without compromising their services. The lady who did my manicure was great and very friendly. I think her name was Vi . . . the gentleman that did my pedicure was really great. Most of the techs chatted with customers and that is something I can appreciate. They even gave me a great deal on a mani-pedi through the Yelp site that I was not aware. I will certainly go back and have spoken to a few people in the Gilbert area who recommend this place as well. Thanks for the great service :)

The people at Frost may not tell you, but Angels make the gelato. What you are actually eating is Heaven. If you listen closely once you have finished eating there is a holy choir singing. It's true. I heard it once myself.   Worth the hype, the price and the wait. Expect to wait 20-30 minutes in the late afternoon. The staff try their best to give quality service with such long lines. Just be patient and you won't be let down.

You typically can't go wrong with Chipotle. The wait is a little time and ordering ahead doesn't provide much relief from that. Even with that, the staff try their hardest and are friendly. We are regulars at this location and I don't have any complaints.

Tastebuds is the entrance to Heaven . . . as in . . . their address is something-something Heaven's Gate Avenue. . .  One of my favorite features about this business is their cute kid area. This is a nice spot for the kiddos to color and maybe use crayons as toppings for their ice cream. No judgement, I frequented the Play-Doh as small cookies back in my day. Aside from that, if I am not mistaken I believe the area may be dedicated to a child that left this world too early. It's a great way to memorialize a precious child that was loved by so many.  Let's talk about the froyo itself- delishhh! I rationalize going to Tastebuds so frequently by telling myself that it is healthy (before I pimp it out in toppings.) The flavors are really yummy and do not taste artificial.   TOPPINGS!! I love trying different combinations and TasteBuds has a great variety. Sometimes when I get gummy bears, I try to race against time and eat them before they become gummy rocks. Not such a good idea, you can get a tummy ache and limit the amount of froyo liquid you are able to drink at the bottom of the cup.  Go to Tastebuds :) Go so much you become a Buddy for LIFE! FOR LIFE!!!! That means when you are 80.. you can walk up in that joint and be like . . . when I was 7 I had to walk 4 miles in desert heat to get to the Froyo! We didn't have flying monkeys to transport us to the Froyo!!!

A good burger is hard to find - Flannery O'Connor  Okay, O'Connor didn't say this. . . but if she had Rehab Burger then I am pretty sure literature would be a bit different.  A co-worker and I decided to give Rehab a try after I read a few reviews. One thing about me: burgers are something I crave, not necessarily a frequent on my to-eat list.  My friend ordered the Porkster and I ordered the Hangover.      1)  Each burger patty was seasoned to perfection.      2)  The chef understood what a medium burger should be and it was perfect     3)  The Porkster was great if you really enjoy meats. To be honest, I could have had             the pulled pork alone. The burger patty was just more awesome under a bun      4) The Hangover was devoured by my co-worker (we split our burger in halves and              shared) but I felt like something was missing. I would have preferred to have                 some sort of spicy...something on it . . .or a bit more cheese. Next time, I'll think               about the sauces they provide and request something different.        5) Order the sweet potato fries and make sure they give this white sauce to dip            'em. I am pretty sure that sauce is made from love and a dash of Heaven.  We arrived before the restaurant started pouring in with customers (around noon) so if you're wanting a quick in and out lunch, I am not so sure this is the place.  All around you get what you pay for. I couldn't finish half of my Rehab burger and had a lot of Tots left over. Go there and expect to be satisfied!

No thanks.  Read this place was closed. . . with good reason(s):  Tasteless Food Slow Order Fulfillment Unorganized employees  I forecasted this restaurant would not be open much longer. Too bad I didn't buy a lottery ticket beforehand.  I hope a great restaurant takes advantage of this location. It is a great spot for the Food Truck Friday population that are unwilling to wait in line for the hot sun. Aside from that, it has potential.  Squash Blossom--squashed for business...

Before moving to Phoenix, I went to a GiGis in Kentucky to buy him a cupcake to celebrate my move and many other memories. Gigis holds a special place because they are a symbol of tradition and many happy times.  This Gigis took all that and stomped on it. I agree . . . there are few cupcakes and the customer service is poor. I called ahead to place a reservation for a few cupcakes that night. The lady said I did not have to do that, many cupcakes were available. I know this isn't protocol but said, " I am coming in the late afternoon, your selection is often limited. Can I please reserve?" No, no, she said I would be fine. Nope! There were a few cupcakes to choose from, all chocolate which my boyfriend hates. The lady in front of me had the same experience because she said, "you told me there would be plenty." I cried in the store. I had a white-girl fit. Not to ruin tradition, I called the Tempe location and the guy said, "Ill only save them if you promise to come pick them up." What kind of customer service and protocol is this? Promise to pick them up? I'm calling you.  All around a terrible experience. . . .I hope the employees realize what type of service they are providing.  The cupcakes are great, but I'll just wait til I visit Kentucky again to frequent Gigis.

If Heaven doesn't have Snoh then it is no place for me.  The staff are friendly and are helpful to new customers when picking out a flavor. The decor is really interesting and gives to the unique atmosphere and vibe. I love they display local art.   I get the taro flavor with condensed milk and mochi balls. It is like angels are in your mouth. My friends were talking as I was eating Snoh and I paid no mins. No conversation was important enough to distract me from the taste.   "Hey, Britt..... I need to share my innermost thoughts about a very intense topiic that may change my life.."- Friend  *evil glare*** "No...."   *shoves Snoh in mouth***

Cafe Zupas is a great spot to eat when you want fresh ingredients and a decent sandwich. The price for portion, above all else, is what keeps me coming back. I have yet to try their feature soups, I typically stay with my regulars: Grilled Cheese, Enchilada Soup and Summer Chicken Salad. Once upon a time they had a great Asian BBQ sandwich that was raved about and helps encourage those that do not like typical sandwich shops to join. Unfortunately, that was taken off the menu and its hard to find a nice substitute for my boyfriend.  The restaurant is clean and the workers are friendly. Service is fast too, even if you are behind a person that is ordering for five different people.  Cafe Zupas is worth a try. I think you'll be a regular after your first visit.

I can't say enough good things about MSF. The staff is friendly and attentive, the facility is clean and doesn't distract from your fitness goals. I love coming in here at all hours and appreciate that it opens really early for people like me that have quite the commute Monday- Friday.   I do wish they would provide more guests visits, then I could hopefully inspire more of my colleagues to join!

Meh.   That's about how I describe this food truck to others. It's not horrible...but it isn't great.  I work in Downtown Phoenix and The Grilled Cheese Truck was parked outside among two other trucks: The Pizza People and a creole-themed truck. There wasn't a line at the GCT, so I figured that was somewhat of a risk, but I decided to partake anyway.  I ordered the Brie Melt which is different at this truck than online. It doesn't come with Roast Beef, but rather bacon. All around, the sandwich was not the best. It was too burned on the bread and loaded with more onions that bacon or cheese. I have read a few reviews regarding their sauce options, but the variety was lacking this time. The tater tots were cooked well. . . not burned like the sandwich.  I'll have to agree the price is a little steep for what you get. I have frequented many food trucks and paid a similar price and feel I had better quality food and presentation than this place.   Would I try it again? Perhaps. If there are no other food trucks I am interested in giving a try, then I may opt for another go.

This review is based upon the customer service and the wait, as the party I came with were never let in. Weeks prior to our bachelorette Vegas trip, we met with a promoter who provided us details to get in for free at the club. There may have been a drink requirement but I am not sure.  We were told the club opened at midnight and arrived in line at 11:30 pm. We were expecting to get in, but the promoter told us that unfortunately we would have to wait anywhere from 1 to 2 hours. We did skip a few lines to the guest entrance which was a much quicker move. However, we waited about 2.5 hrs before getting to the entrance.  Just when we thought we would be able to get in, we were told it would be $60 entrance. Apparently "being on the list" ended at 10 pm... I am not sure how that works if the club wasn't open before then, but what do I know... Needless to say we didn't pay. Not impressed with just the outside customer experience we received. I am sure the club is nice inside... At least it appears to be on Google.

The caramel macchiato was hot, fresh and smooth. I used soy milk in any case I got sick on the flight ahead.  As for the breakfast sandwich: no thanks. I ordered the bacon egg and cheese on croissant and it was a huge fail. I feel bad for the sandwich really, it tried but fell short of all goals: taste, presentation and price. $8.00 for basically a huge, peppered, flat egg with a hard croissant. The sandwich was hot, bur the bacon was crumbled and had a bit of cheese on it.   Overall, expensive as expected in an airport but terrible food. Come here if you want to just have a flat, breaded egg.

After a few visits to HOB, my experiences can be summarized: great craft selection, decent food, decent service and reasonable prices.  Until my most recent visit, there have been only a few occasions that I have requested to try a new beer and it was out. However, when I invited several of my friends to dinner on a Saturday night the experience was much different. Many of the selections were tapped out and it was difficult for the waitress to know which ones would be available.  During busy times, the wait for beer can seem a bit long. But, the waiters were great about letting us know if there was a big group in the back. Also, because the beer would fluctuate on availability, this would cause a lot of back and forth visits to tables. All around the waiters and bartenders have been very kind and patient.  Food is pretty good. I will have to agree with other reviews: it seems impossible to get your burgers cooked as requested. A friend and I ordered medium well and the meat was cooked to a crisp. BUT! The baked mac and cheese--- oh my gosh!!! So good!!!!! I would forgo any of the burgers just to have the baked mac and cheese.  Price is reasonable for the food and beer selection-- provided you get your correct order and they have available beers.  Okay I admit it. . . . I am just disappointed that the one time I want to show this place off to my friends they really let me down with the selection :( If it weren't for this thorn in my side- I would give 5 stars!

Decided to drop in to American TapHouse after it changed from BoomBozz, which I had not visited before.  The interior appeals to Western theme and some of there menu reflects this. Though, I'll agree the strong point is pizza. Nothing sticks out to be a "must-try" item. We tried the pretzel and cheese appetizer and it was great! Glad to know by Dennis' review that the appetizer really aren't the best deal during happy hour.  The waitress was attentive. She allowed me to try a variety of beers. The best is Papago Orange Blossom. I didn't notice any lack of experience in their knowledge of beers, but I didn't ask.   I tried a pizza and it was great! Pleasant tasting, though I dare say that the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a fish platter and it looked pretty typical- nothing out of this world. Another friend had a burger- he said it was okay. Nothing special.  Nothing special seems to be the theme. I agree: the restaurant is trying to tap in on the 'craft beer" but added nothing else to the experience. The focus is off point, but I think they are too scared to focus on pizza because that would be reflective of BoomBozz.  Will I go back to this place? Sure, but mostly for the craft beer. . . which is still not the best priced. The food is just something to have if you're trying to fill your tummy, not if you're trying to have an amazing experience.

YAAASSS!!!!!  I am so happy with the highlights I received from Riley at Edge Salon. Not only is she very sweet and personable, but she verbally "walked me" through her plans for my hair to match my vision and request.  She is so quick too! I was expecting a three hour highlight that I have received before that is rather exhausting for both artist and client. Nope! She is fast-pace and doesn't sacrifice the quality of her work.  I booked two future appointments with her because I was so impressed.

I tried this place when I was craving soup. There were only two choices, but I suppose I retrospect it isn't really "known" for its soups. I ordered for myself and fiancé: chicken enchilada soup and pastrami. The soup was spicy and warm, the pastrami was mostly bread and lettuce. The prices are expensive for the portions you get. In my opinion, I would rather drive to Zupas for better food and more bang for the buck. I probably won't be going back unless I am craving carbs and lettuce.

Cheap  Delicious  Excellent Customer Service  Fresh  Did I mention Delicious?  I go to el Chino about twice a week. I acknowledge this with no shame. Since they have opened the service is much more streamlined and fast. The ingredients are fresh and with variety for those that really like to pile their tacos with a multitude of toppings.  Tacos are street-style size. Burritos are large in size. You will leave satisfied without feeling miserable.   Suggestion: Get the Turkey taco. . . it will not disappoint. Make sure to put cheese on it.

Salad and Go: Okay, focus on Salads...but I am here to announce their breakfast is fast and filling...also decently healthy. Get the Peanut Butter Wrap-- yes you can make that in your home, but the point is that a delicious breakfast that won't make your pores greasy, is available for consideration. I will agree with the other reviews...if you get a salad it is a hit or miss regarding the meat. I have been here several times and it is a hit or miss. Sometimes I am surprised and pleased for the amount of chicken I receive, and then other times I feel my meat is playing hide-and-seek.

This place really fun, but the staff is a hit or miss.  I have been here a few times and can make a fair review that there needs to be more staff and more training for the weekends.  The precious time I came we waited approx. 15 minutes for an attendant to help with the system. We also met our waiter and were served some time later but the orders were incomplete.  This was about three months ago and not much has changed.  We arrived on a Friday and were okay with waiting for a "lane" for about an hour. We enjoyed drinks and the ambiance and decided to order. When our lane was ready we asked the waiter when our food would be available and if we could transfer to the Bay Area downstairs. He kindly went to check.  No food order.  Instead of apologizing he said we must have orders from someone else. I explained that was false because I asked about a specific dish and he said it was spicy. He asked if that was okay. Instead of admitting his error he simply said, "there is no food for you." Instead of offering a suggestion to fix the error we were left trying to figure it out.   Going to the Bay was a bit better... Once we found the waiter. She was great and apologized for the error. But we still waited for dinner for another hour.  Poor waitress left to clean it up.   I love the ambiance of this place, but please don't come here hungry. I am sorely disappointed in the service, especially when I was expecting and okay with spending some money on food and drinks.

True to habit, I checked out MOD Pizza based upon the Yelp reviews. I'll have to say, it is worth the chance and lives up to the reviews.  One of the great things about this place is that no matter what you want on your pizza, it is still the same price. At other pizza joints if you add a few ingredients here and there your $10 pizza becomes $20. Upon delivery it looks like a frozen pizza. But, not MODs. Conveniently located off Market, this little place is in a really great location if you are shopping on the weekend and want a quick bite to eat.  MOD has great service and you receive your food quickly. Both times I have gone to place a carry-out my wait time was super short.  I will have MOD in rotation. No doubt about it. Check it out and enjoy the good eats :)

You know. . . vanilla is sometimes just plain. Boring. Unoriginal. Blah.  But not here.  Shakes and Cones Vanilla is like seeing your high school crush again ... and man . .. are they sexy! They're sweet...giving...velvety ... creamy...sexy....delicious... Yes I'm still talking about the ice cream.  The Salted Caramel Pretzel shake is the naughty boy you were told not to date. .. but you do so anyways because what does your mother know? The saltiness doesn't overshadow the creamy, delicate caramel..but increases the flavor profile 10x... Like the naughty boy getting a brand new motorcycle--- swoooonnn!!!!!!  Give it a try! It's a quaint little stop in Oldtown and bring your high school crush or bad boy ex with you!

Wow.  . . I loved the ambiance of this place. While I am no longer in college, I didn't feel like this was a location that only served collegiate customers, there appeared to be all age groups enjoying the company of everyone.  We sat in the back, pass the bags and ping pong tables and it was a great atmosphere for talking to your group or meeting new people. While the menu is limited here, or it could have been the time (we arrived around 8 p.m.) the food was delicious. I had the Thai wings and several of my peers ordered the cheese and pretzels. The beer selection is pretty decent, for this time of year a lot of the micro brews have holiday selections, I recommend the Sleepy Dog.  Despite the large crowd, the waitress was amazing and attended to our requests with a smile on our face (did I mention we were a large crowd??) I wish I had her name to give her a shout out! But all of the waiters seemed to be really on point. I am hoping this place becomes a regular for my friends, I couldn't be more happy with my experience.

Marketplace 42 is the perfect little gem in the East Valley. After months of following the store on Instagram, I was able to visit and I instantly fell in love. There is an array of decor, beauty and health items adorned in this cute little shop for any taste at any price. I loved the store vibe so much, I brought my husband on my next trip. He loved Marketplace 42 just as much as I did and we plan on making many more trips once we settle on a house. The employees are so very sweet and accommodating. I can't wait to host a little party in a few months! Thank you for supporting local artist and keeping the East Valley great!

I love the energy and the customer service at Fatty Daddy's. We arrived about 15 minutes to closing (ooops!) With a group of eight . . .the staff were stoked! Even if they were anxious to get out and enjoy their evening, I would have never known.  I would estimate each of us sampled at least three different flavors before choosing our options. The selection is great and if you skip on the toasted marshmallow, then you're missing out.  My only piece of advice . . . I ordered the Morning Madness and the Nutella flavor. The vanilla scoop was placed on the BOTTOM of the cup, rather than on top of my Nutella... waahhhhhh!!!! It was a rookie mistake, but vanilla goes on the top!  I'll certainly be returning!
