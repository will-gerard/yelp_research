Yeah, walked in, took one one look around, one whiff of air, and walked right back out. My impression in that 30 seconds was enough to send me packing. Gross. Crowded. Humid and smelly. Tiny area and tiny selection of books.   I am a library lover. And this place is only a mile from me, so if there was a chance of it being worth my time I'd go, but no. Yuck.

Yesterday was my first visit here. My kitty was suddenly unable to walk on his hind foot and I was very worried. University Animal Hospital was one of the only places I could find that was open on Sundays. I was a walk-in, so I had to wait a few hours from start to finish, but so worth it.  This place was WONDERFUL. Really friendly staff. Very clean. I saw them dusting and mopping several times to keep it clean between all the animal visits. Nice facility. The doctor was very thorough and gentle with my baby and found the source of his ailment: broken toe. Poor kid. Anyway, this will now be my vet office of choice. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

To the Parlor...you wow me. Just love you! Folks, if you haven't gone here, first of all, holy crap--why not? Second of all, the ambiance is one of those cool, organic  places that makes you feel both hip and sophisticated. It's pretty small, and even though it's right off of Camelback, you'd drive right past it if you didn't know what to look for. Apparently it actually was a beauty parlor at one time (thus the name), and the original architecture reflects that. The food is phenomenal. Salads to pizzas to burgers. Soo tasty. Happy hour prices are decent. Be forewarned that this is a popular spot, so if you go at lunch, make it earlier or later than usual. Both indoor and outdoor seating available. A cozy bar. And a small vegetable garden borders the entrance as you walk in. I've been here many times and never been disappointed. Go! Go now!

Holy crap. Try the Scottish Salmon!!! Ridiculously good. Cool vibe in the restaurant. Service was fast. Food was tasty. Perfect-size portions. Only hitch was when we were given the wrong receipt at the end of dinner and almost walked away paying way more than we should have. Two thumbs up though.

Not crazy about the restaurant portion of Crudo, but the bar has a totally cool atmosphere and yummy apps.

Possibly the best burger I've. Ever. Had.
