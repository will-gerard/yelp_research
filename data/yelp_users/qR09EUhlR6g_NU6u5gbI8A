On the plus side the ambiance is very cozy, in a cottage with rotating artwork, and the service is extremely friendly. There is a dirt parking lot that contributes to the warm, homely feel of the place.  Unfortunately, the food doesn't make its marks. I ordered a porterhouse steak - the trouble started when I wasn't even asked how I wanted it done (it appears to have come medium-well). The steak wasn't lean (very tough in places) and while the sauce it was served with was interesting in the first bites, it wasn't well-balanced and failed to impress the further one got into the meal.   The side of asparagus was al-right, albeit lacked a satisfying crunch, though the potatoes were too starchy to be served alone without a savoury compliment (sauce would have accomplished this if it weren't as sweet as it was).  Yet the crime was in the crème brulee; the custard was cakey. If I had tipped the dish it would not have flowed. That is not how this dessert, one of my personal favourites, is meant to be.

Excellent food, delicately prepared and presented with class in a gorgeous setting.  The atmosphere of the restaurant reminds me of a Lyonnaise or Aix-en-Provence cafe. Frequented by more mature locals, it is quiet and composed, an excellent place for conversation. It's a little rustic and by no means formal; the service is inviting and just standoffish in southern French fashion. Best for smaller groups, no more than 4-6 people.  I've tried two dishes here, the Coq au Vin and the Salmon, and they both blow me away in terms of flavour. The portions are intelligently small, and each meal comes with some of the best mini-croissants I've ever tasted and a rotating dessert.   The only fault I can find are the prices; at $7-$10 a meal, I feel almost obliged to use the tip keep from feeling guilty. An absolute steal, hidden away.

Open 24 hours on week-ends, ample seating area (good for studying or hanging out and chatting), very welcoming clientele, and broad selection of coffee drinks, non-coffee drinks, and desserts, fruits, and random snacks.  The coffee isn't great but not terrible either. The Wi-Fi, while free, is fickle.   One of my two favourite coffee places in Tempe (other is Cartel off University & Ash).

Delux's fries, sweet potato fries and aioli (garlicy, olive oil sauce) are really what makes them special. Try them and get out. Bar has a great selection of beers.  Service was nice and the ambiance aspires towards a Deutsch discotech. We opted to sit outside because the neon blue lighting inside looked overbearing.   The Delux burger itself is much meatier than most burgers, and I think this is what impresses most people. Unfortunately, the meat and bread lack flavour. On return visits, I tried it a few more times, but there's something about the meat that sets me off. I usually walk away feeling not quite right and suspect the meat has been treated.  Nice place for people who don't care too much about the food but want an interesting ambiance; otherwise, it seems to stretch its image of itself beyond reality somewhat. I don't object too strongly to coming here, but on my own accord, would not choose to visit again.

I went in on a slow day and asked to order one of their hot sandwiches; turns out it wasn't in stock. So I went with the Asiago bagel with a Sundried tomato paste. I wanted a drink, but all they had were some bottled Nantucket Nectars and orange juice; I went with the Nectar, which was too sweet for my taste.  After waiting ten minute for my bagel, I asked what was going on...they had forgotten my order. The server, annoyed, made me another bagel and it was out in a few minutes.  Even at first glance, the food looked utterly disgusting. The bagel's crust wasn't firm, but all soggy from the oils it was prepared in. The faux cheese topping was old, stale, and tasteless. But its the filling that got me. Not even a spread, it was a gooey, thick, oozing, sludge. When it arrived, I tasted a little of it on its own and quickly hoped that it would taste better with the excuse-of-a-bagel; a few bites of the bagel proved me wrong and made me feel sick to the point where I almost threw up.  Terrible food shouldn't be so terrible it makes you sick. I suspect their kitchen isn't as clean as it should be, or, that they get their food pre-packaged and delivered (from where they let it go stale). They'll soon be famous for poisoning half of Tempe.

So I went back today, hoping that my experience was a single bad incident. This time I stayed clear of their bagels and went for one of their Italian Grilled Sandwiches, which seemed decent. I secretly hoped that given the price at $7, it would be a tad better than the previous day's horror.  Unfortunately, even as I just opened the sandwich, my stomach screamed in protest. It was the same, gooey, prepared mess as before. The chicken (which wasn't even cut, so the two halves of the sandwich weren't separate) was tough, dry, and flavorless. The vegetables were overdone and gooey. I suspect the whole thing was made in a microwave because even the bread had lost its texture. Needless to say, after a single bite, I donated my meal to the trash can.  I stand by my last review; this place has got to be one of the worst places I have ever eaten.

Absolutely delicious appetizers and entrees in an establishment with passionate owners. Although the desserts weren't much to talk about, the menu is creatively refreshing.  I had the fish, and what stands out to me is the tart sauce it was prepared over. I had never thought fish could go so well with tart, but the balance was perfect. Sides were expertly chosen to complement the flavours and presentation was stunning.   As for desserts, I tried the "cheesecake" and chocolate tart. The cheesecake came deconstructed and was lacking in unique flavour while the chocolate tart, while satisfying, was somewhat bland. Both were seriously under-portioned. I think they overshot here with the uniqueness of their presentation and ingredients.  I will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu, and will reserve dessert for another location if and until their offerings evolve.

Thin crust pizza, not as oily as La Grande Orange's, that holds its form through eating. The toppings preserve their distinction from the local alternatives, e.g. Cibo (less savoury), while not going so far down the path of differentiation so as to render a product uniquely useless.  Yet the true reward for going came with dessert - we tried the lemon meringue. The meringue itself was sharply tart, with the sweetness serving to ensure the tartness wasn't harsh and nothing more. This is perfect! Too many places have prima donna sugar that tries to overpower the lemon. We tried it with a traditional crust (which I preferred due to it preserving the tartness and lemoniness of the meringue) and a graham crust (which my friend preferred for being easier to eat [the graham crumbles] as well as buffering the tart notes of the meringue).  A star is missing for the ambiance - wait staff were very friendly, but the venue was empty. Low windows, low lighting, as well as no street-level windows on neighbouring buildings contributed to the sense of isolation. That might add to its charm though, which carries a sense of timelessness.

Last week caught me travelling for longer than I expected. I was running low on contacts, and shipping another box from home was not an option. Luckily, I was staying near the Camelback Colonnade LensCrafters. I figured they would have access to my prescription, which was written at a LensCrafters in California. Even if the lenses were out of stock, I could afford to wait while they shipped in.  When I called, I was told my LensCrafters in California would have to fax in my prescription. Inconvenient - my prescription is available at LensCrafters.com - but not the end of the world. I comply.  Forty minutes later I received a call from Miriam at the Camelback Colonnade LensCrafters. She informs me that they did not have my lenses in stock. I ask if she could check whether other LensCrafters in the area had the lenses in stock. She tells me I should call them myself.   Then she hung up. I am not sure if she was being rude or negligent. Either way, nobody deserves this kind of lack of professionalism.

Delicious coffee and savory crêpes (ham, Swiss cheese, spinach, and Dijon is my go-to). If you can wait.  Short-staffed, this is not a late-night mecca of efficiency. Variable and inexplicable waits should be planned for and embraced.

Simple, honest ice-cream. Had the butter pecan with salted caramel. Not too sweet, not insecure in its culinary proximity to frozen yoghurt, and sensibly portioned.   Like the outdoor patio seating; wish it was set up less as a quick stop and go and more as a place you can get a cup of ice-cream with a friend and chat for a while.

As far as burger joints go, this place is definitely a favourite. They don't have a unique sauce like In-n-Out, but their burgers feel hand-formed, and the meat is of top-notch quality. Definitely try their fries.
