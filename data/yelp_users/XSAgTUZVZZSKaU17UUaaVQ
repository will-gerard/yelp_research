Do not go to firestone! They have HORRIBLE customer service and have shady business practices. The feedback survey they currently offer ($10 off $25 or more on services) is NOT anonymous despite saying so. JOE from this location made a point to bring that up as he mistakenly thought i submitted a survey on our interaction of just scheduling an appointment. If he looked at the time stamp he would have realized I submitted the survey PRIOR to coming in...Regardless to even bring that up to a customer was shocking and showed exactly why he was rude from the get go of just today's conversation.  Firestone is notorious for adding on additional unneeded services, plus they are only concerned about bringing in their next customer, I dropped my car off at 7am and didn't get a call until after 2pm and that's just the call to go over what needs to be done.. I am a longtime customer and I continued to go to them because I had warranties and already purchased lifetime alignment (which they don't always remember  to do when requested) that I didn't want to go. They are dishonest and have no integrity as a company at least at this location store #020516. The manager JOHN GIBSON is just as bad as his employees.. He didn't even apologize about after I had discussed how JOE was extremely unprofessional. He had less than 4 words to say, his response  to my poor experience just went to show the culture at this firestone. He does not lead by example and his poor management is a reflection of the customer service given. Last thing to mention when I went to pick up my car both JOHN and JOE were gone and I had to speak with MATT who like them didn't let me finish we hasn't even started talking about this and he refused to listen Saying he's just a "third party, I'm not apart of this" and it's not his job to do this. Overall horrible experience on all levels please save yourself the headache of coming here. You will come in with small issues and a small starting total and leave with more problems to keep you coming back and a higher bill.

Absolutely amazing! It has been a while since I've returned but Papaya Thai has the best curry and Thai food in town! The portions have increased in size and the quality is to die for. Very authentic. The service is sub-par and the a/c could be cranked up a notch or two. Regardless best Thai food in town. I highly recommend the pad Thai and mango curry! The mango curry had the perfect hint of sweetness and I got mine medium heat. I don't recommend eating the mangos as they are more for flavoring of the entree.

This is my new spot! By far a hidden gem. Got a gel manicure with a design that I requested and they executed it flawlessly!! Julie prepped my nails and removed all my cuticles!! She took her time and then did the polish and design so well! I showed her a pic and she hadn't done the half moon trend before but nailed it. I am so obsessed with my nails and I will be a forever client. Total cost 25 bucks! 20 for gel manicure and 5 for design, been looking for a spot like this in town! Affordable and flawless thank you ladies! I advise an appointment and this nail salon only specializes in polish and gel manicures, no acrylics.

If you want incredible glowing skin and all around great customer service go to Bronze Buddha! Jayd is very personable and really takes the time to ask the right questions. I already have a natural tan but I wanted a spray tan to even out my skin for a bikini competition. Luckily Jayd asked more questions instead of just assuming I wanted to be super dark like most people do for competitions! The only thing I will add is my left hand ended up being a little brown even though Jayd took measures to prevent that. Overall I still rated Bronze Buddah a 5 stars because the service was exceptional!! I will definitely be back, thank you Jayd!!!

The quality of the  food is excellent but the customer service is way below par. We were given plastic silverware to eat our food because they were "out of silverware." When I asked how that was possible the lady explains their dishwasher didn't catch up from the morning rush... We had to use plastic silverware until we requested again that we needed silverware considering our  banana foster could not be cut easily with a plastic knife.How difficult is it to wash a pair of silverware? We were also the only people in the cafe at the time! To make the experience worse  they also forgot to put in our chicken florentine crepe!! We  waited 10 minutes before asking b/c in the past our entrees have arrived at different times. Also, despite their limited menu Delice Bistro is frequently out of items. Last time I was here they were out of the special of the day,  another time a popular breakfast item, and today it was Nutella. However, towards the end of our visit a family arrived and it appeared Nutella was back in stock...I love the food and I have raved about this place to friends and co workers, but the lack of consistency and customer service might cause me to rescind my recommendations. I was coming here once a week, but it will be a while before I give them another shot .

I love the food and have raved about this place to friends and co workers but the lack of consistency and customer service will prevent me from returning.    3.8.2016   INCONSISTENT AGAIN. --I called to order a pick up and was FORGOTTEN about for 4 minutes while I heard the employee ringing up customers...when I finally hung up, I called back and the line was still busy..called back again to find out they were out of the rosemary chicken  panini and that it is being "made again" since it is always made from scratch. First of all, that does not make sense, if it's always "made from scratch" how are you out? Obviously to some degree that is pre-prepped which is fine but they clearly do not re-make it enough throughout the day to match service levels. They are constantly out of items! You should not have to wait until everything is at zero before re-stocking.. Delice bistro needs to take a course in how to operate a business . If they invested more in training their frontline employees and focused on how to operate efficiently they would make more money and have happier customers.

Great place for bikinis! This store is new and has a good selection of both competition and casual swimwear!! The owner is amazing and knows her stuff when it comes to swim! She takes the time to assist you with choosing the right color and by informing you of what's popular for swim!

By far the BEST hot dog joint in town! A must try is the Italian beef sausage with sweet and hot peppers dipped (in gravy) sounds weird but it creates an orgasmic combination of flavors! Melts in your mouth. Don't be deceived by my poor photography skills as the photo does no justice. Also the chili cheese dog and regular hot dog was tasty! The bun is top notch, it is soft, fluffy and fresh tasting -you can tell it's a quality bun!!! Seriously best choice for affordable gourmet food and the service is phenomenal, FAST and friendly!! This is foodie paradise.
