Octane used to be sick when they had gas go-karts, now it just sucks. The cars are slower to start with and if you happen to bump into someone they reduce the top speed of your car. Not worth the $20 for the ten minutes. Highly disappointing

Like someone said before me, "Don't go here if you need something done quickly". They are always incredibly understaffed and it can take 30-45 minutes to make a simple deposit. They always insist on having you make an appointment, even if you have a quick question or need something simple done, like having something notarized. A merchant teller is supposed to be there starting at 10AM, but is rarely ever there. Running a business is incredibly time consuming and a merchant teller is quite convenient to have, however it's never available!  With all that said, the people in there are incredibly nice, so plus one star for that.

These guys are great! They've always taken very good care of me and all my mail. If you're looking for an alternative to a PO box, look no further!

Best curry in town. This place is one of the best curry I've had and I've had curry all around the world. A+

Great atmosphere! It's everything you need in a bar: great people, friendly staff, management that looks after their customers. Best college bar on Mill hands down
