I've been coming here for the last 3 years and have to say it always delivers.  The drink specials are addicting, the food is way beyond what you'd expect at a bar, and the scene on weekends is packed full of people looking to kick back after a long week's work, relax, and have a good time.  Highly recommended!

Two visits on consecutive days, two awesome sandwiches and pasta. When asked if they've been here long, shared a laugh at a very well delivered deadpan 42 years. Pictures of family everywhere, clustered italian deli and dry goods, frozen, take home and cook yourself available. Cash register must be from when they opened, very charming. Had their pastrami sandwich, italian hero, very well balanced between the that-morning-baked bread, juicy meats, and refreshing veggies. Oh, and it's CHEAP! A huge sandwich will set you back $3.25-5.55. Also they have freshly made cannolis! This will become a weekly ritual for me and my co-workers, I'm thinking.

Sorry, but you automatically go into meh territory when cashier is presented with a coupon, stares at it for 2 minutes, and says quite audibly oh shit and scurries off to get a manager.

Agree this is the best of the Serrano's locations, and that the Val Vista and guadelupe location is the worst.  The bean dip is always warm and tasty, chips almost always hot and salted reasonably.  For the last 5 years the chicken tortilla soup and albondigas have never, ever been less than superb.  In terms of food, service, ambience this is really 3 stars, but for being so damn consistent over the years gotta give this one a 4.

About once a year I say to myself, I like Serranos, but I wish there was one closer to my apartment.  Then the memories that I have sealed return, saying Hey, what about the terrible one on Val Vista and Guadelupe roads?  It's the same local chain, surely all your previous visits were aberrations, and it will rebound to approach the quality at the other locations.  No.  Chips and bean dip are consistently room temperature or cooler, service is generally inattentive.  Enchiladas tasted microwaved.  Water glasses and plates were dirty.  Albondigas watery.  30 minutes to get check.  I just don't understand how this location is so much worse than the rest.  Hope betrayed too many times, just pack it up at this location.  Shut it down!

The owners are indeed a mom and dad operation, and at one point their daughter was a server/cashier nearly 5 years ago, the last time I was there.  The decor is lovely, with a very light pink coloring on the walls, and some bolder Thai decorations in the center rear of the restaurant.  I bring up the 5 years because after I ordered my favorite roast duck curry incarnation, pin poy brought out her husband ( sorry, name escapes me ) and said I knew he was going to order this dish!  We shared some nice laughs, caught up, she explained about the only change I noticed, which is that the eastern wall is covered with drawings from the children of her customers.  With anyone that oozed a hint of smarmy character it wouldn't work, but these two are so genuine that it's very endearing.  I wrote all that because I do think that a rating reflects your overall experience including service vs reasonable expectations.  I had the everlastingly popular and delicious roast duck curry, which had a good portion of sliced duck, cherry tomatoes, pineapple, grape in a red curry sauce garnished with mint on top.  I've eaten probably at a dozen thai restaurants in the valley and about the same in SoCal- in terms of authenticity, flavor, and even presentation, Siam Orchid is your standard bearer.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.

Well that was disappointing.  Can't summon any humor for how disappointing that was.  Great first impression, nice big open airy restaurant, patio was open and has tiled tables, fireplace, pretty windows with big leafy designs, dug it, even talked about maybe moving the rehearsal dinner here.  That would've been a mistake.    Seated, were given chips and salsa.  They were fine.  Server stopped by asking if we needed a few more minutes.  Fiancee responded we needed a few more menus.  My order were their seafood enchiladas, and chipotle albondigas.  The soup was oily and the meatballs fell apart upon contact, so were a bit too mushy.  Some nice spiciness, but just too greasy and broth too thin.  57 minutes after ordering our entrees showed up.  What a joke.  Billed as seafood enchiladas, mushy enchiladas filled with 1 part shrimp and fake crabmeat 9 part cheese.  Couldn't taste the seafood at all.  Ranchero sauce was fine.  Beans and rice were acceptable.  Overheard server say to another table "Was it at least okay?"    No.  Never again.  What a total waste of 1.5 hours.

Unfortunately still in pissy mood at going 0 for 3 in last new restaurant attempts.  Once again, a brief review filled with disappointment and regret.    Started with the Spanakopita, which was labelled as a Spinach Cheese Pie for $3.95.  It was cold.  What should have been flaky heavenly goodness in the form of phyllo dough was just greasy congealed torture, which was quite impressive with how this was so damn cold.  Maybe they should've left this in the microwave longer.  Blah.  Entree that was recommended as their house specialty was their oven roasted lamb for $11.95.  It was halfway edible as the rice was sorta interesting with pine nuts for a nice crunch, but was a little dry.  And then the lamb.  It probably wouldn't be fair to say it was dry, it would be more fair to say it was Arizonan desert sand masquerading as meat.    Damnit, so disappointed again I can't even think of a witty way to end this review.  God bless the edit button, I'll have to come back with something.

I can see why this has been here for 25 years. Great burger indeed, great atmosphere, the vintage pacman machine up front made me laugh. Interesting the divide between the cozy dining room when you first enter to the lively bar as you explore more. Ping pong table outside, and horseshoes!

Cindy's Arizona Cafe was a very nice treat this morning.  Sampling their breakfast and lunch dishes, our group had the Grecian salad, bacon cheeseburger, a two-egg breakfast with hash browns, toast, and 4 strips of bacon.  Everything was top notch ingredients and freshly made.  My salad was a great assortment of lettuce, carrot, cabbage, cucumber, tomato, olive, house-made croutons and gyro meat.  The vinaigrette it came with was very light and mild, but the zestiness of the ingredients made it unnecessary to have a powerful dressing.  I especially liked throwing in the bell peppers.  My gf and her mom both indicated they loved their meals as well.  I definitely want to go back for a more traditional breakfast, as every table has housemade jam or orange marmalade.  I have a fantasy of just ordering 12 slices of toast and running around the restaurant sampling the jams at all the tables.  Don't be surprised if I do!  In the meantime, consider that 3 of us ate, all ordered drinks, and the total came out to be $28.

This location was my first foray into sit down mexican food 8 years ago, and I still have warm fuzzies when the possibility to eat here arises.  The bean dip is always warm and tasty, and a little different every time with varying levels of spiciness.  Chips almost always hot and salted reasonably.  Yesterday I had tthe spinach enchiladas dish, I'm very keen on here, with a nice cream-based sauce on top smothered in cheese.  The vegetables side is great and think everyone should get it when they come here.   In terms of food, service, ambience this is really 3 stars, but for being so damn consistent over the last 8 years gotta give this one a 4 just like my closer location.

Unfortunately the creative juices are not kicking in this morning, but I had to put up some type of review because having this place at 4 stars is a travesty.  What a stellar experience my girlfriend and I had on Saturday!  The decor was nice, it probably seems old-fashioned to some but I loved the blue tablecloths with white brick inside.  The bread was fine but not quite worth raving over, and the oil/vinaigrette(balsamic vinegar?) was just ordinary.  Everything thereafter was phenomenal however, starting with a calamari appetizer for 9.75, a good number of unbreaded ( thankfully! ) rings of chewy goodness swimming in a sea of garlicky red sauce.  My cioppino was similar except with whitefish, mussels, shrimp, clams, and capers in the sauce, which gave it a delightful bite to it for 21.00, and the 3 slices of garlic toast was woefully insufficient to sop up every drop of sauce.  Thankfully bread re-fills are there for that!  My girlfriend's Gorgonzola Gnocchi for 16.00 was RIDICULOUSLY good, and I normally hate those who unnecessarily capitalize but I can't help it, I can't think of any other way to convey to the reader how AWESOME this was.  Creamy, and even tangy somehow, cheesy perfection on perfectly cooked potatoey goodness.  Finally the tiramasu for 6.95 was a revelation on how tiramasu should be, with the perfect cocoa/booze/biscuit ratio to end our meal on an even higher note.  My iced tea was 2.50 as well but I don't recall seeing it on my bill.  It made the tip look better at $70 at least, go 30%! ( I almost never do that).  Man, just awesomely awesome, my style and humor are out the window this morning unfortunately, but I do love this place already.

As noted by other reviewers, the decor is We-are-SO-German in your face, yet not feeling kitchy, but just overwhelmingly inviting, and transports you to another continent in this quiet corner of Mesa.  This superb meal started out with a Warsteinner Oktoberfest, a delightfully smooth tasting, autumny mug of beery goodness setting me back $3.00.  After bringing out our drinks, we were also given complimentary rye bread, which had a decent flavor but would've been nicer if it was much warmer.  I ordered Sauerbraten for $11.50, sliced beef covered in a mild brown gravy with a surprisingly very pleasant sour undertone with hints of tomato.  The spaetzle was straightforward, simply prepared tiny noodles with an unfortunately bland taste and texture reminiscent of risotto.  This was definitely skippable and unfortunately the only reason this is not a 5-star.  My other side was sauerkraut, which paired perfectly with the Sauerbraten and gravy to bring the sour taste more to the fore, while still accenting the savoriness of the beef and saltiness of the gravy.  My girlfriend ordered the Cordon Bleu Schnitzel for $11.50, which was a thinly breaded and pounded pork chop, covered with ham, swiss cheese, and a light creamy sauce binding everything together.  The breading gave a crunchy, pleasant mouthfeel, the meat was satisfyingly succulent, and the ham, swiss, and sauce gave it a richer feel.  Truly divine!  I took a nibble of the red cabbage an stir-fried potatoes, which were mixed with bacon, that I found very enjoyable but nothing to write home about.  The Jager Schnitzel that my girlfriend's best friend ordered, was Schnitzel covered in a mushroom gravy, and was reported to be delicious as well.  Finally, for deserts we ordered apple strudel and Schwarzwalde Kirschtorte, both setting us back $3.50.  This was an outstanding conclusion to our meal, with the apple strudel containing tart apples hidden within, with soft, buttery layers of perfectly cooked dough generously topped with a vanilla sauce with plenty of powdered sugar.  The Schwarzwalde Kirschtorte, Black Forest Cherry chocolate cake, was also immensely satisfying, with the ice-cold cherries being a perfect counterpoint to the dense chocolate and frosting.  Stuffed, impressed, drunk on flavors and revelry, the final personal touch was the owner insisting we take some cookies she made from a plate left out at a bar.  The aforementioned accordion player made his appearance as we were leaving, so if you want to hear him be there after 6:15, at least on Thursdays.  Head over to Zur Kate for a wonderful meal, with great service and atmosphere to match!

Sooooo, there's a lot on my mind.  The economy is in terrible condition.  We're being labeled as racists, we're still mired in multiple wars, I really want the Heat to suck this year but am afraid they won't, I think I'm gaining weight, losing my hair, and I am certain that my right foot is bigger than my left.  But you know the worst thing about my life right now?  No meat.  If only I was talking about the musical group, but alas.  My father passed away last week so to respect Buddhist beliefs, no meat for 49 days.  So what is a bacon guzzling, sausage stuffing ( shame on you for having a dirty mind!), carnivorous soul going to do?  Eat at Lalibela Cafe of course!    Walking in, I was a little wary of the $50 authentic Ethiopian attire in a basket as you walk in.  Better not be a tourist trap, I am thinking.  Continuing to look around, it felt a little cluttered but not too much so, with some interesting art and more clothing on the walls to peruse.  I was running a little behind on time as I had originally intended to go to Byblos which was closed for renovations until August 20th, so I cut short my examination of the decor to order.    I ordered the Vegetarian Sampler (7.99), which is your choice of 3 out of 5 dishes to go along with the injera or rice.  I also had the Yekemem Shai (2.50) black tea with cinnamon, cardamom & cloves cold, which was a refreshing drink.   The Masir Wat, red split lentils simmered in hot sauce and herbs, was delicious and made me not miss meat so much, with a texture reminiscent of ground beef and a spicy flavor that was subtle but satisfying.  Tikil gomen, lightly spiced cabbage, carrots and potatoes was also a winner, with an almost buttery finish.  Gomen, chopped collard greens cooked with garlic and onions was the only component that was merely okay, with the flavors being a little too mild for my taste, but by no means bad.  The injera itself was a quiet partner in the backdrop of all these flavors, slightly sour and spongy.  While no one checked in on my meal, no one had to, as I was quite pleased and didn't need a refill.  The initial service was fast and efficient as well, even with only 2 on the waitstaff and about 15 people coming in right around when I did.  So you know what?  Our economy is going to recover.  I might be a little racist but who isn't?   Wars are just disagreements taken too far, Lebron will remain crownless, I'm just big-boned, there's always Rogaine or a toupee, and I can always get custom shoes where the right is bigger than the left, and I have Lalibela Cafe to thank for putting me in this frame of mind.  Thanks for a great lunch, and I'll be back often, meat or no meat!

Meant to try Classic Italian Pizza today after eating at The Parlor on Sunday. Which by the way I loved, got the Yukon Gold Potato Pizza, but for that I'll add to the various Parlor threads. I'm definitely a pizza neophyte when trying to explore beyond what the to-go places, streets of new york, nypd, etc. Unfortunately, didn't realize they were a 5-10 place!  Wandering around Mill Ave and realizing the 202 was approaching, decided to stop at this corner restaurant. It's huge! The parking lot and entrance seem to have a very weird relationship however, and the myriad unmarked doors, little alleyways inside the building made me a little leery, but also induced a sense of adventure, as if I was exploring some mysterious castle. A little fun in and of itself, but not quite what I want to feel before I walk into a restaurant. After finding the entrance however, I was entranced by the history this restaurant proclaims. The hostess (mind you, this is around 1:40pm) said that someone would be with me shortly, which was a little weird because no one was in the restaurant, but I didn't mind because there is so much to distract you. Articles, history, guns everywhere, a little bar area, curtained rooms, partitioned rooms for what I fantasize secret meetings taking place, I gotta admit, I was enchanted. Not so enchanting was after I walked around the building I realize we still had not been seated. There were probably about 4 tables of customers, but I was shocked to look at my watch and see it was 1:50pm. I mean, 10 minutes at a near empty restaurant? Come on.  We were led through the honeycomb of rooms to an area that had a view of the historic Hayden flour mill under construction. I guess it wasn't the prettiest picture with the state of the building and halting of the restoration, but it promoted some conversation I suppose. Country music crooned gently in the background, the restaurant felt quite but that was likely due to the size and lack of customers. I can never resist baked potato soup, and upon ordering it and some sprites it was a mere 2 minute wait. I remember thinking to myself, now we're talking! Creamy, peppery, thick with potato, I thought it was a very nice version, but I still rate Crackers and Co version my favorite. It was almost too heavy, but still, I was happy. The server also asked if I wanted to have the Monti Bread, which turned out to be decent but room temperature. It was pretty tasty regardless with dill, garlic, almost-but-not-quite over salted, an almost fluffy interior. I just really regret the temp it came out at, I thought it could've been great it it came out hot.  Unfortunately ,the temperature as well as the I-don't-mind-taking-my-time-and-thus-your-time theme continued. When my lunch order of 7oz prime rib came out, along with mashed potatoes I ordered as a side that came with it, we were in the 20-25 minute range. 3 containers of au jus, horseradish blended, and sour cream were the perfect accompaniments for my lunch. The mashed potatoes were great, melting-in-the-mouth variety while being slightly firm, hate liquidy mashed that you find at lazy restaurants. The prime rib I ordered medium rare, and it was, also seasoned very well, was luscious, although I must admit its the first time I've had prime rib for probably 2 years. My girlfriend ordered the fettuccine chicken alfredo, which had a nicely rich without being oily sauce, and the pasta was tender. However the chicken almost seemed to be an afterthought, without feeling much seasoning and just mopping up the sauce, and being slightly dry. With that said, a feeling of wistfulness pervaded my meal, because I felt that it could've been amazing, but was done in by service issues. I enjoyed it, I will probably go back, but in the recesses of my mind I'll be judging and wondering if being teased by a the promise of a great experience and being let down to a good one will be worth it. This place will either be a place I come to love or hate, hopefully the former!  7oz prime rib w/side lunch: 11.99 fettuccine chicken alfredo: 14.99 2 soft drinks: I think about $6 the soups didn't appear on the bill, but they would've been 2.99 for a cup, 3.99 for a bowl.  I'm a fan for now, but subsequent visits will determine a final rating.

I hate to pile it on to a local restaurant that is struggling, but it is what it is.  Walked in to the pizza side, very hot, was directed to the bar side, waited ~15 minutes for my pizza.  Had the 12" white pizza for lunch, with the advertised lunch specials being unavailable @ 11:40.  Ricotta, mozzarella, whisper of garlic.  Very lackluster, the cheeses seemed old, with the ricotta being especially clumpy and not creamy.  The crust on the outside edge was terrible, with the crazy sensation of toothpaste somehow.  A cavernous bar area that was completely empty from 11:45-12:25.  A very depressed owner matched this soulless mockery of a restaurant.  Pay your respects for 15 years of service... and move on.

I came here last week on a Mission.  That Mission was to find a rival for my current favorite pizza at Parlor's, in central phoenix.  We perhaps slipped in to quietly, as were ignored for a good 10 minutes after coming in.  However, the surroundings seduced us into staying, with a huge oven greeting you by a very nicely stocked bar alongside, dark, rich wood interior.  The bliss on our fellow diners' faces and the speed at which their food disappeared gave testimony to the quality of this place  My Prosciutto pizza was absolutely amazing.  A perfect crust, charred here and there but wonderfully firm throughout, yet still having that feeling of lightness I usually associate with pillows as I ate.  The toppings were top notch quality, and they definitely do NOT skimp on the prosciutto- every inch was covered outside of the crust.  Normally this would be very unbalanced, but the high amount of basil, toned down the rich saltiness of the prosciutto.    My gf loved her 4 cheese pizza, with mozzarella, ricotta, feta and parmesan cheese.  It had a similarly superb crust, and was a wonderful white pizza.  With that said, this garnered less raves from me because of the layer of oil atop it- I did not inquire, but it gave me the impression that they had brushed the top of the pizza with oil before serving, which is something I despise, although to be fair my gf had no complaints.  By the time we had finished our pizzas, we were the last diners in the restaurant, and it was about ten minutes past their closing time.  Huge props to the server for offering us a dessert, which being tirimisu, I could not resist.  And this was a dangerously addicting version.  The least chocolately I've had, which I thought would be a turn off, wound up being one of my favorite renditions of all time, incredibly creamy and not too boozy.  We were told that it was an in-house recipe and I believed them, and approved.   If I had only had my pizza, and if we had not been ignored after arriving, this would be 5 stars.  We will have to return, and I will try that 4 cheese pizza again and see about how they garnish their pizzas before serving.  Until then, 4 will do, with the hopes that future visits will promote to 5.

Very pleased with the ceviche section.  Cute lil tostadas with great tasting toppings, some unconventional topping on the special ceviche tostada.  I don't really want to give away its secrets, try it yourself!  Less pleased with the marlin machaca.  Definitely not fresh tasting compared to everything else, but was surprised at how good the rice was, very lightly buttered and salted with some nice snap to the veggies.

Visited again after a 5 month hiatus, and happy to report that I re-ordered all their ceviche tostadas and found them all very satisfying.  Small bonus for remembering me and offering what I wanted right away.

Multiple visits through the years reaffirm my love for this place!  The pregnant tostadas are the best with real crab vs the other tostadas, accompanied by lovely scallops and shrimp.  As other say, the shrimp molcajete is very tasty, and also props to their goburnador tacos.  Avoid the stuffed filet preparations however.    Overall, still extremely worth braving the sheriff's posse in Guadalupe to get some exceptionally good food!

Oscar Mike Golf!  With a side of Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot.  How is this so good.  How am I summoning the willpower to type as I am floating in a wonderful world where there is no such thing as war, disease, corrupt politicians.  Where there are no people who cut you off on the I-10 only to realize they don't need to and promptly go back to their lane, and then realize they wanted back into my lane after all, giving my brakes the workout of their lives, damn you random teenager.   I give my heartfelt thanks to whatever noble bovine prince gave up his life so that I might have such a wonderful, spectacular meal.  And also my thanks to Dick's Hideaway, for giving me this moment to revel in this dream world composed of nothing but delicious flavors and complete food coma.  True to its name, Dick's Hideaway has no signage proclaiming its location, quietly residing on the northwest corner of 16th St and Bethany Home Road.  Of course, it needs no signage either, with its legions of fans and great reviews.  Walking in today around 1pm, the bar was full, and there were only 3 tables in the main room, but our server let us use a table/booth in the adjoining room.  It was a little daunting having this room to ourselves, surrounded by hundreds of bottles of wine, but the comfortable booth we were in helped, with pillows bountiful in number and cushy, as well as the flat screen on ESPN.  Having been here numerous times but not for nearly a year, I called up a number of old favorites, getting the Pasta Heidi, Carne Adovada, and the Richardson's combination.  Pasta Heidi was a beautifully presented and tasting dish, with green chile linguine covered in an addicting chipotle cream sauce, topped with grilled chicken.  This hit all the right notes, in terms of texture re: the linguine, creaminess of the sauce, lingering spicyness of the chipotle, tenderness of the chicken.  The tortilla that lined the bowl underneath was given no mercy, as it had soaked up all the wonderfulness above it.    Carne Adovada was the previously alluded to pinnacle of porcine expression.  Whereas the Pasta Heidi was wonderful with multiple levels of flavor woven together in harmony, this was more in your face with each aspect fighting to the forefront.  An initial smokiness greets you when tongue meets pork, followed by spiciness of the red chile sauce and savoriness of perfectly cooked, ridiculously tender pork, and returning once more to the smoky.  There has never been a war so happily fought as the one these flavors battled for supremacy over your taste buds.  You might be confused for a moment after that first bite, asking yourself did that really just happen?  I assure you, it did, and to take another bite.  Conversation died off at the table as we were quietly in awe of these dish.  Finally, the combination plate I ordered had asparagus, chicken enchiladas in green chile sauce, and a single portion of eggs benedict.  The asparagus was competently prepared as was the chicken enchiladas, but lacking the depth of flavors found in the other dishes.  The eggs benedict however was superlative in its own right, with a perfectly poached egg on top.  A gentle tap with my fork had that yolk spreading like golden bliss over beef tenderloin and english muffin, all crowned with a jalapeno-infused Hollandaise sauce.    With these 3 entrees and coffee, iced tea, and sprite, it came out to be $57, so this restaurant could never be called cheap, but even with tip bringing it to $72, I would say that after leaving I feel we still got the better of this exchange.  Dick's Hideaway.  I bow to you in humble appreciation, and will return for more time and time again.

A quick and disappointing review.  I do wish to preface this by saying I walked in at 8:20, so maybe I didn't get the best they had to offer.  Not a big fan of the winding line like a mini-cafeteria.  Ordered the BBQ sampler, brisket dry, pulled pork dry, chicken moist and the best thing on my plate, ribs tender and tasty but not spectacular.  Lightly sauced which I really liked, and the sauce itself was tangy, a little sweet, and not overpowering.  Sides of cheesy potatoes was ok, mac n cheese pretty sad.  The lemonade was tasty.  Good value, tons of food for $12, but will have to try again closer to their peak hours and see how it goes.

Still stand by my prior review.  The hot links were the best thing I had, the ribs were fine once again, brisket unimpressive again, I actually liked the cheesy potatoes as opposed to my g/f, sweet corn was institutional.  We came at around 2pm on a Sunday, and though still a steady flow of customers coming in, after my 2nd visit I begin to question why.

Unfortunately my rancor at this visit prevents me from trying to put any humor into this review.  In short, my $2.75 ceviche tostada was overwhelmingly saturated with limes and ridiculously soggy.  When asked about their best soup, I was told to get their Caldo De Rez, which was a $7 admittedly large bowl filled cabbage, carrots, and literally 4 pieces of tough, thumbnail sized beef.  I tried to give the evil eye to the server as I left but he couldn't summon the courage and kept staring at his popcorn machine turned into chip dispenser.  Look me in the eye when you lie to me, damn you.  Ugh.  Hatred.  Fury, rage.

"Worst service ever. Not sure if waitress hates Asians or if  Nam said something to piss her off... but never going back to Scuttlebutts."  So mad at this place won't even try to be original or funny and just copy paste my wife's tweet.  I've bookmarked this place to try for years and should've seen the rating drop as a sign to go somewhere else.  First impressions were good- converted house restaurant, tasty sounding items on menu. 2nd impression was not so good as I peeked under the table and saw a pizza spatula near the base of the table in the booth.  No matter; they had 2 servers on a busy Friday night.   Understood being told to sit anywhere by a friendly lady ( God I wish she had been our server ) and waiting awhile.    Didn't understand immediate attitude of new server Sandy/Sharon/something.  Walks up, then walks away a bit to yawn for a good 5 seconds.  Okay, fine.  Tell her what we want to drink, order some apps, but we want to hold on to the menu if we will order later.  Sullenly walks away.    Returns with drinks promptly.  Appetizers arrive not so promptly.  Clam chowder was full bodied, creamy chowder stocked with tons of seafood but surprisingly little flavor.  Conversely the lobster/crab chowder had almost no seafood, but flavor of the broth was rich.  If they'dve dumped the contents of the clam chowder in the lobster chowder that would've been an awesome soup.  Fried green bean fries were delicious.  Mini raviolis were extremely tough on the outside, and seemed of the frozen + over nuked variety.    Remember how I said I wanted to hold on to the menu in case I wanted something later?  I had overheard our waitress tell every other customer about their all you can eat fish + chips special and was tempted.  Alas our server came by and dropped off the check and scurried away quickly.  Thwarted.  Maybe they made a great tiramisu.  I ask our server and she informs me its pre-made and shipped in.  Well then.    I've never regretted leaving a tip so much in my life.

I don't quite understand the negative reviews either- I've been here multiple times, and the only miss I have ever had were the crab cakes.  Every other sandwich, burger, salad, breakfast skillet, french toast, that I have ordered has been fabulous.  Coming here for the last two years, this location has been a model of consistency in food and good service.

I have been here 4 times this month.  I'm a huge fan due to the value of this place.  Unmentioned so far has been the huge facelift of this restaurant- it's twice the size, really nice deep blue colored walls, wooden floors ( on the new half, sadly concrete on the old half ), lots of asian touches in terms of decoration that are understated but elegant.  The food is very good, from the appetizers to the greatly priced sushi, their specialties rolls won't get more expensive than 6.50.  Speaking with the chef-owner, they receive the same seafood suppler as Hana's in phoenix.  Which is nice because this place is literally half the price!  I've spent $12 on 3 rolls of sushi and been stuffed.  I will keep going to this place and hope you will too!

I'll admit, some of the recent reviews made me leery about returning here.  I returned today, and very relieved that the alleged roaches, if they were ever even here, decided to move off the premises.  I went a little over board with the sushi today, getting a higley roll, which is a CA roll inside with white fish (shirome?) on top, sliced jalapeno, and a dash of srihacha sauce.  8 piece roll was 6.50, I was pretty happy with the spicy flavors and size of the roll.  I'd also ordered the Aji (mackerel) sashimi, very tasty, with a surprisingly smooth finish, and at $5 can't complain.  The spicy tuna roll, 8 pieces for $4, was standard, the tuna with a great soft texture, and perhaps would have been better if I had not had the spicier Higley roll earlier.  A 6 piece roll of yellowtail with scallions for 3.50 was also filling, but nothing special.  I finished off the night with some salmon nigiri, which as always was superb.    As ever, the quiet confidence of the chef and friendliness of everyone working here makes this my favorite sushi place in the East Valley.

Still extremely happy with this place, and upon reflection, wish to add the great value here, after going to Sushi Eye on a Friday night and dropping $120 between 2 of us, with a comparable huge meal coming out to be $70 here.  Nigiri excellent rice-to-fish ratio, with the fish definitely being the star of the show.

Oh that's where I left it!  Years of neglect, conformity, discomfort has dulled it.  Lack of attention has made me nearly forget it existed in the first place.  I should've gone shopping with it more often, dressed it up nice, took it out around the block so people knew it was part of my life.  Ah, Vietnamese food, cornerstone to my soul growing up.  How I've missed you, and how wonderful it is to find you again.  I was born Vietnamese but grew up denying it.  I'm happy to report that Pho Ao Sen has helped me bring some Viet soul back in my life.  Although I blame my girlfriend for never wanting to go out for Asian food, I completely forgive her years of indifference for suggesting trying out Pho Ao Sen!  I will say that walking in, I was incredibly nervous.  I've never been to a Vietnamese place that I loved if it had nice decor or great service.  Opening the door, you're greeted by a lovely water feature that is just the right size to catch your attention but not be too ostentatious, and everything is a lovely dark mahogany-colored wooden theme.  A sleek looking bar is the centerpiece of this nicely sized restaurant, ~70 or so I estimate it could seat.  We were seated promptly, and courteously asked what we would to drink.  The missus stuck with water, while I indulged in Da Chahn ($3.00), a wonderfully tart, cooling, freshly made batch of lemonade.  Toni ordered Pho Ga ($6.75), which arrived in typical gargantuan bowl fashion, and also came with it an agonizingly tempting aroma (can't eat meat for another 21 days) that had me literally over her bowl, nearly overwhelmed by the rich scent.  My biggest pet peeve with any type of Pho is oily broth, and this was the 2nd cleanest broth I've ever seen, second only to my father's.  Chock full of chicken and suitably accompanied by traditional accompaniments, as soon as I am free to eat meat I will come back for this.  I ordered the Bun Bo Xao Xa Chay ($9.00) Lemongrass "beef" (textured soy protein with the consistency and moisture content of beef) stir-fried in fresh garlic, sliced onions, and lemongrass. Served with rice vermicelli over bed of fresh shredded lettuce, mint, and bean sprouts, also with crushed peanuts aplenty.  A surprisingly tasty soy-based sauce mixed with something vinegary made a wonderful stand in for nuoc mam (fish sauce).  I ate about half and decided to take the rest home.  Remembering how it tasted, I broke that promise in about 3 seconds and wolfed the rest down.  This could go down so far as my favorite vegetarian dish of all time.  Wow, just wow.  I love this place!  It's more expensive than most Viet places I've been too, but the quality of food, service, and decor more than build enough value for me to pay twice as much.  I am ready to bust out the my old bamboo hat that I've kept hidden over the years and wear it down the streets with pride.  Sure, scoff, stare, mock; I'm Vietnamese and proud of it because our food is absolutely amazing!  I'll never turn my back on it again!

After the closure of one of my favorite restaurants, we've made a pledge to support our local restaurants more and try different local place.  The Bellagio Pizzeria has been around for awhile, but we've never been.  First impression was great!  Very interesting decor, some cute murals with a forest motif on one wall, my girlfriend sat under the squirrel, some more typical but still eye-pleasing depictions of Greek villas elsewhere.  A very sleek looking bar area with some flat screens and cool blue lighting was in another area of the restaurant, which looked like a great place to knock back a few.  We were seated promptly in a comfy booth and got our drink order taken right away.  Unfortunately, once the food started arriving things went downhill.  Our appetizers showed up the same time as our entrees, and it took about 25 minutes to get them out anyways.  The Spanakopita ($7.00) were 5 bite-sized pastries.  Not I'm hungry bite-sized either, more like I'm an anorexic model and need to lose weight bite-sized.  The spinach and cheese inside were a very mild and forgettable combination, and most of the flavor came from the pastry itself, with the buttery layers inside being quite tasty.  Overall however, this was a very very forgettable appetizer.    Less forgivable were the falafel ($6.00) our friend ordered.  The chef somehow managed to focus all his hate and resentment against the world in hockey-puck-masquerading as chickpea form, resulting in a moment of my life I wish I could take back.  The spicy tzatziki that it came with was pretty interesting, but not enough to salvage the dish at all.  My 10'' Gyro pizza ($9.00) sounded good, white sauce pizza with gyro meat, onion, pepperoncini, black olive and feta cheese.  Unfortunately I did not detect the feta cheese flavor much, and the pepperoncini dominated the pie so that it was much too sweet.  The crust itself was excellent, crispy and darkened in some areas, but once again, the lone positive not enough to salvage this dish.  Toni's white sauce pizza with chicken breast, garlic, fresh broccoli ($9.00) was decent, but just a run of the mill generic white sauce pizza, with the broccoli being notable as adding an interesting crunchiness but not too much flavor.  Our friend didn't seem too thrilled with her gyro combo either, opting not to take it or the hideous falafel home.  So, our first foray to a new restaurant was a fail, unfortunately.  With Cafe Mix on the same corner, I don't see myself returning to Bellagio Pizzeria.  Hopefully the next new place will be better!

I apologize.   I should not have laughed when my little sister blew into a bowl of pepper and it shot up into her eyes and she ran into the bathroom crying.  At 28 years of age, perhaps I should stop finding fart jokes funny.  I am sorry that I take all the fun flavors out of chex mix bags and leave you with the boring bits.  But most egregious of all, I am sorry that I have lived in Arizona for 10 years and didn't try Sourdough Pizza Restaurant until about two months ago.  I have only ordered take out from here, so perhaps I should not review, but I suppose we'll just have to add this on to the list of regrets.  The Crazy chicken wasn't really crazy, but definitely still satisfying combination of mozzarella, cheddar, barbeque sauce, chicken, red onions, and mushrooms.  This was a touch sweeter than we would've liked but the chicken stood out.  The Pizza Blanco was a simply olive oil, ricotta, mozzarella, garlic and choice of two toppings, which we decided to be bell pepper and onion.  This was an outstanding pie with each bite being a perfect proportion of cheese, topping, and dough.  Speaking of which the sourdough was an excellent foil for both pizzas, absorbing the flavors well and getting to that savory, slightly fatty satisfaction in the interior but not greasy in the least on the exterior.  Obviously, I have a lot to apologize- however, I promise that you won't have anything to be sorry about by trying out Sourdough Pizza Restaurant.  Go now!

Yesterday Toni and I went to Pasti's Eurogrille and Delicatessen. Not too many grilled items, and the market area gets smaller and smaller for each of our visits.  However, it's still a very pretty restaurant, with a slightly dark but comforting interior.  Thankfully, our frequent  visits are not about the market, or the classy and roomy interior, or even the ruggedly handsome owner of the restaurant Luca. It's about the Food!  I guess my lunch was pretty straightforward. I had a Palermo, which is genoa salami, cold smoked pepperoni, ham, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato & "special sauce" (tasted like a savory vinagrette). It came with a fruit cup. The sandwich was very hearty, the bread rustic, and a simple but satisfying lunch. Part of me was proud of going for healthy in eating the fruit cup, but then the cynical part of me reminded myself I had drank about a gallon of Sprite, which I can only assume is not that healthy. Definitely one of the better sandwiches I've had in the Valley.  Toni's lunch on the other hand was spectacular. She had pasta di diavolo, bowtie pasta with spicy italian sausage, fresh basil, crushed hot red peppers and creamy marinara sauce, sprinkled with fresh parmesan reggiano cheese. Wow. That sauce was what made this dish so heavenly. Toni let me finish hers off, but she is pretty light on consuming sauce so when it came to my time to step up to the plate (call my agent but let me assure you I consider my comedy routine an art form and not mere entertainment) I noticed there was a good portion of pure, unadulterated, heavenly sauce. With a frenzied look in my eyes, I spoon up the marinara , consume it feverishly, and eye with resentment the glistening remains of marinara on Toni's fork.  Pasti's Eurogrille and Delicatessen really elevates my mood whenever I go. Besides the food, there is a very welcoming atmosphere here. It's the only restaurant we go to where we are encouraged to play Boggle! Luca said its because they want to create a relaxed atmosphere where people want to go to hang out as much as to eat. Mission accomplished.

Although still pretty good, the dinners we've had here that were sublime have downgraded to satisfactory.  This might be why after trying to stop by last night that Pasti's is now closed.  It was a nice run, and I'll miss them.

Greek restaurants and I have a relationship akin to one of my neighbor's as a young boy- I couldn't pronounce his name when I first met him, and I was kinda afraid because he was so different and from another country.  It would take about 5 years for me to summon the courage to try to be friends, and my first attempt ended in disaster.  Grisly dried out bits of alleged lamb in some strip mall in Minnesota.  I swore, never again.    Time has a way of healing all wounds however, and my heart would try to open up again.  I wanted to be friends again.  We found out we had a lot in common!  Strong, bold flavoring is how we like to live.  We want to live balanced lives, so yea don't throw solely some gamey meat in like that likely-abandoned "restaurant" in MN, put in some onions, tomatoes.  And you always have to have your friend that is the life of the party, Tzaziki!  He's the kind of friend that no matter how much you hang out, you never want to say no when he wants to hit the town.  Once I became friends with my neighbor, I realized Hey, these people are EVERYWHERE!  I have been living in a box.  What a wonderful world with so much variety and life!  Little Greek restaurants are popping up all over the country the last decade or so it seems.  I have been friends with some and sworn enemies of others.  However, I have not forgotten my lesson as a young boy that realized there were more than just Asians and Caucasians in the world- Cafe Mix, will you be my friend too?  Pulling up to Cafe Mix is a relaxing experience.    A colorful depiction of a Chicken Greek Salad surrounded by Pita greets you, tempting you right away.  Opening the doors, there is a vast ceiling with a very nice beige color, and depictions of Greek culture and art are everywhere.  Tasty, Healthy, Food! is blazoned above the cooking area, and you can watch the chef at his work on the grill.  It could probably seat about 50 people, but the layout makes you feel like it could fit double that.    As much as I love the Gyro however, I wanted to try out as much as I could.  Eying the Mix's Combination, which would net me Lamb gyro, Chicken Gyro-style, Tenderloin Kabob, and Chicken Kabob, I felt that was the broadest way to get acquainted.  At 11.99, it included basmati rice, salad, hummus, and pita.  Thinking the price was lower at a place I frequent in Phoenix, I inquired if the serving size was enough for me ( I audition for the Before Guy in those Slim-Fast commercials ).  I literally overhead the table behind me laugh, and the server smiled with quiet confidence, saying "I'm pretty sure it will be enough."  I also ordered a bottomless fountain drink/ ice tea, for 1.75.  My girlfriend was less adventurous, opting for the Bacon Cheeseburger adding fries, with the burger being $6.50 and another $2.50 to add fries and a drink.  This confidence came to be well-founded.  After getting some green tea and picking our seats, barely a minute passed before I was brought the salad that came with my meal.  It was a worthy rendition, with a great balance of Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, feta cheese, onions.  Not too much dressing which I approved of, the olives and onions gave it a tart kick, balanced by the cheese.  I forgot to take a picture, but the serving size was much larger than most salads thrown in with your entree.  Our entrees arrived, and my Mix Combination looked great, with a faint vapor rising from the freshly grilled meats.   I tried the lamb first, and was satisfied, but not that amazed.  It had the right flavor, and I wouldn't say it was dry, but, it was approaching it.  Then the beef tenderloin- this was nicer, with a nice juicy pinkish center.  I would've liked the outside to be almost charred but that is a personal preference, this had more than adequate moisture and definitely a valued member of this meal.  The chicken-gyro style was better than the lamb, but still not quite out of this world.   Then the chicken kabob came and put all the others to shame.  I don't understand how, but it put up plenty of resistance when I cut it with my knife, but it came apart in my mouth.  This was the best chicken I've had in my life that was under $10 at a restaurant.  Just crazy good.    The rice was straightforward, cooked competently.  The hummus was colorful, but not as flavorful as some I've had before, and the pita bread was also fine, but was almost a little too hard for dipping in hummus.   My girlfriend's burger was fine, with a hand-molded patty, bun finished on the grill with some butter, bacon nice and crispy.  Lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion also packed in, I'd say this burger is about equal to the burgers you could get at Red Robin.  The fries were out of this world!  Seasoned perfectly, crunchy on the outside and pillowy wonderfulness within.  Sometimes, first impressions are so good that you know you will be friends for life,  which I believe Cafe Mix can be.  Work a little on the sides, and 5 stars is in your future!

I came here last Sunday and just want to add to the accolades. I felt a little confused seeing the herbs outside, but upon being explained their actual usage, I admit I fell into the This is so Cool! attitude, which may have colored my experience. We ate outside which was very nice, the foliage growing on the wall behind me was not off-putting, but surprisingly endearing. We ordered the Yukon Gold Potato pizza and the Pepperoni, for my less adventurous significant other. The Y. Gold was my favorite pizza I've had so far in my life, very thinly sliced potatoes, creamy ricotta, pancetta, and leeks, all combined for a great pie. The pepperoni was pretty straightforward, well-executed but nothing I'll remember next week. For desert, the tiramasu was delicious, but I must confess I am a tiramasu fiend. If not for my very sensitive teeth, I would've appreciated the caramel chips sprinkled throughout more, but my gf said it went well with it.  This place was great! The last aspect I loved was the feeling of comfort it induced, I wound up spending about an hour here despite the pizzas coming out very quickly, just a great place to relax and eat. I plan on coming here over and over!  8'' pizzas = $10, so obviously 2 = $20 Tiramasu = $6 Soft Drink = $2.50 each

I have never felt worse after eating at a restaurant.  Sometimes, the food is terrible and the service is terrible so you kinda enjoy bitching and moaning.  Sometimes the service is bad but food is great, so you put up with in hopes that it will return.  In this case, I had so many hopes for this place, and was treated very kindly, but unfortunately the entrees were terrible, yet I feel guilty about writing this because I want them to succeed.  There were some hopeful beginnings.  Walking in, there are bright colors and some Cuban flair, and to your left you see a nice mural depicting Cuba and the life of a family there.  Very open restaurant, and a local live band comes some evenings, very nice.  A very lengthy menu cast its spell of seduction upon us, and I tried the Chicken noodle soup (4.99 for a bowl, 3.75 for a cup) for a light starter.  Unfortunately, it was entirely too light!  The flavors were acceptable, and there were nice bits of shredded chicken, carrots, celery.  However, there was just too little of everything!  A decent sized bowl, but the contents I would guess is 10% solids and 90% broth.  It made a nice vehicle to dip the bread in as a moderately redeeming factor.  As for my entree, I also ordered the Picadillo criollo, ground beef cooked in tomato sauce with olives, potatoes and raisins.  Bland, bland, bland, a case of disproportion.  A good sized-entree for lunch at 9.99, but all tomato sauce, and trace amounts of olives and raisins.  A very thin sauce once again.  I agree that the plantains were delicious, but the rice was pedestrian and the black beans were ridiculously watery, even more so than the beef 's sauce.  With all that said, the only times I have spoken with a manager at a restaurant is if I was irate at the service AND the food.  You have to come here to feel it yourself, but its very welcoming, it's been here for 8 months, and I really want them to succeed!  In this case, I felt compelled to speak with the owner, who received my feedback as well as could be expected.  A little defensive when it came to the black beans, insisting that the watery nature is how it is served in Cuba (perhaps if you have food rations it makes sense to water down your food so much, but that really shouldn't apply here, and my two other Cuban restaurant experiences in AZ beg to differ), but accepting I wasn't happy and offering a 20% discount.  I appreciated the gesture, but told him it wasn't necessary, and that I'll appreciate more if the level of the food rises.  I do intend to return, and hope today was just a terrible, terrible first impression.  Still, because of the owner's reaction, I give this 2 stars for now, which I hope will rise next visit but fear will drop to 1.

I was in Vietnam last May, and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up, so to qualify my 5 stars, "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  I say to what's available of what I've seen in PHX area.  With that said, I've had the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Tai, Com Tam Dac Biet, Bun bi cha gio, and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness, freshness of condiments, integrity of broth ( lack of oiliness ), and general flavor.  The only thing that didn't rock my world was the bahn mi sandwiches- can't vouch for the assorted outsourced items in the chilled section either.  Besides that, If you want Viet food this is your place for the PHX metro area.

Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period.

I was pleased to find this place in Mesa, which people claim lacks quality non-chain restaurants. Well, we do have quite a few hidden gems, and here is another one. Sandwiched between a half-dead strip mall and a drive-through smoothie place, and with honey baked ham cafe around the corner, this was a hard place to find. It's about a block west of power and baseline on the north side. Looking upwards, the signage for the restaurant looked very modern with some flair. Walking in, you have some very bare bones interior, with a tv in the upper corner with fox news playing, the o'reilly show was on. This place feels pretty tall too with really high ceilings. There is a drink station near the entrance, and then an area with sauces, utensils, and napkins. One thing made me smile when I saw the entire roll of paper towels each table (probably 8 or so) had. Looks like its okay to be messy! This is a mother, father, and son from Georgia who decided to open a BBQ restaurant in Mesa, which J Ruggs has been at for about 2.5 months. They all were very nice and cared greatly about their food. On to the food. I had the two meat plate, which for 9.75 INCLUDING a drink I thought was a great deal along with 2 sides. I think it was a dollar less if you only wanted one side. It was $1 more if you wanted to go with ribs or brisket, so I got the pulled pork, 1/4 ribs (also pork), mac n cheese, and coleslaw. One thing to note about this place is you need to sauce the meats yourself, if you want sauce on it. I expected to have the juices of the pulled pork require no sauce and the ribs to require plenty. I was pretty surprised- the pulled pork was thoroughly average. Meaty flavor but dry, I first applied a spoonful of the hot sauce, and was not too much happier. After bathing the pulled pork in hot sauce, it became a good dish, but I really do think it needed more in the moisture department, and that you shouldn't have to drown pulled pork in sauce. 6/10 flavor with the sauce, 4/10 without. Fearing of the ribs, I tackled my sides. Wow what a reversal! The mac n cheese was nearly perfect. The texture felt like a baked layer on the outside and then a tender pasta inside. It was also liberally sprinkled with pepper which I was initially skeptical of but after that first bite, approved. One of my biggest pet peeves about BBQ places are they're lazy with the sides- not here. This mac-n-cheese disappeared in record time, and I was astonished to note that there was nearly no residue of oil at the bottom of my dish. The only reason this doesn't get a perfect 10 is because the cheese flavor was very very good but not quite the bold, rich, cheesy flavor. Still- 9/10 I don't have quite as much to say about the coleslaw. It tasted very fresh and was a nice counterpoint to the heaviness of the rest of my food. Very crispy greenery, and they didn't commit to the cardinal sin of drowning it in mayo. 7/10 (Very competently made, but not extraordinary, and to be honest I don't think I will ever give coleslaw more than this score) And finally, the ribs. I ate these last because I ate an edge piece and found it disappointingly dry. The owner's son happened to ask me what I thought of my meal, and told him what I've written thus far, basically. He was very upset but not confrontational- just very hurt that someone didn't think his ribs were that great. He offered to get me another piece, but I told him that wasn't necessary. Luckily for me, it turned out it wasn't, and how. An incredible amount of meat for only 3 ribs, and I didn't get cheated like some places do by getting you ridiculously fatty cuts of meat (you know who you are!). Being a sauce-less preparation, I was prepared to also soak this in the pulled pork bath remains, but was incredibly blissful that I didn't have to. These ribs stood on their own in flavor and I dribbled a few drops of hot sauce on them. Heavenly! 9.5/10 (it can't be perfect because of that first stray morsel, but I'm pretty sure if I went again I could give it a 10) Overall Restaurant Experience: 8.5/10. You gotta love when people obviously care and when their hard work shows.

I stopped back here today and fell in love again with those amazing ribs.  11.50 including tax for a half rack of ribs, soda ( unlimited refills), huge slice of texas toast, and the aforementioned by john green beans.  Every thing on the plate played a starring role today.  The dry-rub style ribs today were absolutely incredibly, astonishingly requiring no sauce whatsoever and just being ridiculously flavorful and tender, even more so than last time.  I don't usually rave about green beans, but I had to note these were peppery and meat-hinted but not flavored, if that makes sense.  If it doesn't I don't care, just visit here and try them for yourself!    I also was treated to a free sample of their brisket, what in the world, I didn't know brisket could be so juicy.

Today, they had a review in the AZ Republic, which contributed to the high number of customers an hour before they closed.  As John confessed, they were slammed like never before.  His in-laws were visiting, and they were so busy John wound up enlisting their (willing and smiling) help!  I did not mind the wait, because with the size of the restaurant, about 8 tables, you cannot reasonable expect to receive your food instantly when ~30 people are ahead of you.  I did mind the chicken- beautifully seasoned, but very overcooked, I ate around the edges and the skin and tossed the rest.  John came out with a slightly worried expression, and I told him the truth.  The green beans were also underseasoned, without the normal heavenly savoriness, and pepperiness I've previously expected.  However, the Brisket SURPASSED all my EXPECTATIONS, despite having it twice before.  If barbeque is excellent, I dab about 1 eyedropper size of sauce per square inch.  Tonight, I did not dare to tamper with perfection.  It was just sublimely tender, flavorful, very meaty with just a minute amount of fat... wow.  Just a perfect marriage of flavors and textures.  They would have to chase me out with pitchforks and threaten to burn me at the stake to stop me from coming here.  For that chicken I should really drop it to 4 stars, but, the Brisket compels me to forgive any sins.

Lots of going-ons in downtown Mesa today, live music, a mini-carnival a little south of it, tons of vendors in the streets and people having a great time.  Taking 5 minutes to go through half a mile of greenfield road construction compelled me to avoid the freeways today, and I am extremely grateful for finding this 5 week old deli in Mesa.  I was heading north to Mekong Plaza along Main Street to pick up some seafood (10% off everything in the store right now btw), when the most amazing smell wafted through our car windows.  Those dark streaks of rubber along Main St I confess I am responsible for, as the aroma blanked all thoughts of shopping from my mind.  Pulling into the back, my first impression walking in is Wow this place must have been around for awhile.  Owners calling peoples' orders by name, open kitchen with lots of bantering between the staff, just so incredibly welcoming walking in.  Free Wi-FI too, nice touch.  There is a long corridor with some bar-like seating, and about twenty tables in the main dining area, as well as some tables outside, which were unfortunately all taken.  With the doors open and a mild breeze, it was the perfect weather today too for a light lunch.  Just everything about the interior yelled inviting, and I was hoping the food would match the mood.  Jennifer took our order, and she was happy to confirm that it was a family establishment, pointing out everyone working by name and relationship.  Tons of charisma from her, very smile-inducing just speaking with her.  When someone in the kitchen noticed us playing Boggle, she came over and chatted about Boggle and how she played it with her kids too.  Made me feel a little childish, but enjoyed the conversation.  The tomato basil was a very hearty rendition, setting me back 2.99, although they did wind up giving us 2 for the wait (which I don't think exceeded 15 minutes).  Very smooth and surprisingly thick, but a very pleasant thickness somewhere between a broth-based soup and chowder.  Great garlicky flavor too!  I might come back just for 2 bowls of this stuff, heavenly.  Ordered 2 soft drinks that will set you back 1.59, fill it up yourself.    We ordered the Quatro Fromaggi, a pizza with mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta, & gorgonzola, 8" for $6.99.  A very tasty pie, with the crust being light and airy on the edges, and firm enough to hold the center without bending.  The cheeses blended well, although I would have liked the gorgonzola to come out a little more.  I wouldn't call it exciting, but definitely comforting and something I will be back for.  Pie # 2 was the D'avalo, Spicy ( or mild) sausage, capricola, pepperoni, and crushed red pepper.  Very nice lingering, but very mild bite to it, red sauce not overly sweet, and very meaty, they definitely do not skimp on the toppings here.  Similar quality of crust on the outside of the fromaggi, however I do confess the interior bottom was very oily, requiring some napkins to soak up, although still holding firm enough to support all the toppings.  My gf did not mind and actually preferred this pizza, but I preferred the quatro.  Happy to say a very nice pizza place that I think will be around for a long time.  A nice selection of pizzas, salads, sandwiches and paninis, I can't wait to try some more.  I don't see anything that is earth shattering, but for the price, ambience, and straightforward flavors, this will become your favorite lunch spot if you try it out.

After reading a glowing review, and also reading a 5 word condemning review, I decided it was time for a revisit.  We ordered two 8" pizzas for $6 a piece, and 2 bowls of their tomato basil soup for $4.49 each, along with 2 drinks for 1.49 each.  My gf had the pepperoni pizza and I had their White Pizza, which was simply Garlic, Mozzarella, Basil, and olive oil.  Both pizzas tasted great, with admittedly simple ingredients and preparation but very strong results.  The balance on my pizza was especially outstanding, with neither the garlic nor the olive oil dominating the flavor of each bite.  The Tomato Basil was as usual absolutely outstanding, but could've been served a little hotter, but I am just nit-picking because the temperature was the only thing preventing me from saying this soup was the best tomato basil I've had in my life.  The bowl serving is pretty large as well, in that we finished a pair of 8" pizzas but took some soup home.    My review is shorter than normal because I'm a little irked, despite how much I liked the food- my receipt says I ordered @ 2:40pm, and we received our food at 3:05.  In that time a pair of older gentlemen walked in and received their sandwiches before we received our food.    I wanted to 5-star it to bring up the average, and still might in the future, but I think it deserves the 4 star still.  Come here if you want uncomplicated, tasty pizza or absolutely amazing tomato basil soup.

Food still great.  Wait still ridiculous, but at least the menu reflects that.

Matt Muralt came through for me in a huge way!  My fiancee is a much more dangerous driver now because she keeps on checking on her ring while driving, but likelihood of accidents increasing aside, he made a perfect, intricate, beautiful custom ring and I hope to bring him tons more business over the years.  The whole process was great, and Matt is a wonderful person to work with as well, getting us involved as much as possible in the process, making molds and getting as much input from us as possible.

I've been 3 times, and I don't think the quality approaches what Mike, his wife, and his mother offered in terms of food quality.  Something major has gone wrong with each of my visits so far, 1st being the seafood in the red curry was really chewy, overcooked, and possibly over aged.  2nd being the little boat appetizer nearly chipped a tooth it was so hard.  3rd being the waaaay too sweet mussaman curry I had the 3rd time.  I really wanted to like this place because it housed Mike Thai which I thought was superb on a level with Siam Orchid, but, alas, no.  Might comeback in 6 months in hopes of something radical changing.  Not quite worthy of a 1 star as that should be reserved for places that induce rage and disgust., and Swan Thai summoned quiet, bitter disappointment.

Inspired by Nikki Buchanan's review of this place in the AZ republic today, I ventured out on my lunch hour, hopeful and enthusiastic about a great sounding lunch.  I arrived at 11:20 and was stupefied by the surroundings.  6 tables with enough space for 4 were spread out over a largish space, and a bright red sofa sat in a corner.  However, the walls are painted multiple colors, and not in a oh what a pretty rainbow sort of way, but more of a damn we ran out of this color oh well lets just toss up another kinda way.  Normally this wouldn't bother me, but it wasn't until 11:29 that I was even greeted, and 11:32 I was seated, so I had plenty of time to look around and nitpick.  BTW, there were 3 other people in the restaurant!  Ridiculous.  I was thankful I beat whoever was behind my be mere seconds walking in, who wound up waiting so long after me he switched from a dine-in to take-out order.  With that negative bit out of the way, I was ready to dig in to the oxtail entree, $11.99, so glowingly praised.  Braised to a wonderful degree, it had great texture, flavored in a brown sauce with very slight garlic undertones, and the marrow/cartilage/fat bits were the perfect sidekicks to the meat.  The accompanying rice with peas were great, and even the cabbage had a wonderful tenderness to it.  The plantains were crispy, sweet, and the perfect finishing note to my meal.    So why the 2 stars?  Well, the opening service, and that I received my iced tea about 10 minutes into my meal with half of it gone.  If they were swamped, I'd understand, but there were 5 of us in the 50 or so minutes I was there.  Everyone was asked if they wanted a receipt and everyone said no, due to I believe a fear of wasting even more time.  So in summary, the food was delicious but the service so bad I don't know if I would go back, and I don't think I have ever said that before.

Wow, things really do change quite a bit in a year and a half!  The service issues are still there but not nearly as bad, oxtail continues to rock my world, goat curry very good, last thing I had here was their escovitch, which was an amazing preparation of fish, it somehow had the sinus-clearing sensation of wasabi with some sour and sweet tones.  Their sides of cabbage, rice, beans, plantains continue to seduce.  Their ginger beer mixed with their sorrell drink just might be my favorite new drink in the last 2 years, its worth a trip just to try it.  4 well deserved star update!

After my last very disappointing experiences at Mimita's, I had become afraid to stick my neck out on new Cuban restaurants, and so came to my favorite Peruvian restaurant in the valley.  Alas, they are no more, and here stood Azucar in its place.  I was tempted to turn around, but couldn't resist popping in, as I was determined to find out what a Azucar was.  The lay out is so far the same as when this was the Peruvian place, with a largish dance floor on the left side of the restaurant, some booths and tables very spread out in a pretty large space, couple flat screens with direct tv, a nondescript bar.  An interesting feature Alan, the owner told me, is that on Fridays at 5pm they intend to drive traffic by bringing in antique cars (aren't I so punny) by our standards and common cars in Cuba.  So expect an interesting vehicle exhibition on Fridays after work!  Yelena [sp?], co-owner and wife of Alan, was a charming and knowledgeable introduction to Azucar.  She made me a Mojito, 3.50 to drink, which I was satisfied by but wouldn't say it stood out.  But the papa rellenas was my first appetizer, and it was a very tasty version, crispy on the outside, pillowy on the inside with steam rising when punctured with a fork, and the ground beef mixture inside was seasoned nicely too.  It wasn't a very large portion, but for 2.50, you shouldn't expect to get huge apps to share anyways.  However, the main highlight was my entree.  Brilliantly roasted pork, with a nice heavily seasoned near-crust like texture on the outside, ridiculously succulent and juicy meat on the interior.  Not light on the garlic for the garlic haters out there, though thankfully I am not such a creature.  The rice that came with it was fine, but the black beans... wow!  So rich, and when poured over the rice, would have been a tasty meal on its own.  Cooked with pork skin, a sliver of pork skin found its way into my bowl which, though soft and lacking the texture you're used to with pork skin, was another delicious treat.  This entree for 8.99 also came with a side salad that was nothing special, but made a refreshingly light contrast to the heavy and rich foods mentioned above.      I'm in love with this place and will definitely be here at least once a week.  I'll be the guy at the bar that stares at all the food leaving the kitchen.  In fact, Yelena caught me staring at the home-cooked potato chips and let me try some- delish as well!  You'll love this place!

A man sits at his cubicle .  A man listens, and laughs at the latest trends, as vapid chattering of who cheated on whom, what Snooki is doing next, does this dress make me look fat, do you ever eat cantaloupe with mayo ( WTF?!?!).  A man hears one snippet of information that he scoffs at, but files away for future use, at mention of India Oven being the pinnacle of  lunchtime specials.  A man expects a meal as insubstantial as his co-workers conversation.  A man's expectations are defeated.  Multiple times.  A man cannot deny the siren call of India Oven's delicious food.  Words fail to spring to mind for this man, as he stops thinking in words and begins thinking in terms of curry.  A man has tried every item India Oven offers in their buffet over the course of 5 meals, and has yet to be disappointed.  A man assures the reader he/she will become helplessly addicted as well.

Sometimes, it is just wonderful to be alive.  Actually, all the time it's wonderful to be alive.  Life is amazing, the weather is gorgeous outside, I am or think I am getting better at tennis, my girlfriend loves her job and I love that she is bringing in money for the first time in 5 years, 3 years later I can finally convince myself that bright red is not too girly a color for the car I drive, and I found a restaurant that serves food so good that I want to photoshop some incriminating photos of the husband so that I can court the owner-chef Hanna, marry her, and keep all her food to myself.  As that would be a terrible thing to do and that I don't think I'm really spouse material and that I have no game whatsoever, instead I will eat here whenever I think I deserve an amazing meal and spread the word on how awesome Beaver Choice is!  On to my actual experience, I start with a phone call asking general questions about their restaurant, and engage in a nearly 8 minute dialogue analyzing what I like and ordering based upon their recommendation.  This also creates a 10% discount by ordering over the phone for pick up off their bistro menu, which is nice for my lunch hour.  I wound up picking the Chicken with Cardamom sauce, perfectly seared slices of chicken then simmered in cardamom accented, heavy creme sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, with the seared outside giving a pleasant mouthfeel, yielding to the moist and tender inner portion, all swimming in that wonderful sauce.  You can choose a side dish and 3 portions of salad to go with your entree.  Couscous was heavenly, absorbing all the juices of the chicken and mopping up the sauce in its fluffy goodness.  Tomato-basil salad was fine, but too peppery.  The spinach salad was straightforward and competent, and home-made coleslaw was tastier than most I've had.  Very filling and extremely satisfying, I would bathe in that cardamom sauce if I could.    One note I need to make, a previous review had slammed Hanna for tasting something she was making, and using the same spoon for tasting something else.  When I arrived I mentioned I heard about them on Yelp and mentioned this review, which prompted resulted in me being ushered into her kitchen to proudly display a set of about a dozen spoons at the ready for tasting.  Also of note there are no microwaves!  The pride in their food is entirely justified, yelpers.  The only thing to be aware of is the time involved to prepare your food, but ordering in will alleviate that, or simply set aside plenty of time.    Choose Beaver Choice.  You won't regret it.

I didn't even get a windshield from Joe, but wanted to give him another 5 star review based on our interaction.  My wife's windshield was cracked on Wednesday, and the company I'm working with has had some bad glass come in.  They've stated they can get some more Monday, which I'm still waiting on, but wanted to see if someone else could get any.  Joe had called back and left a message during my initial round of inquiries a few days ago, so I called back today.  He quickly determined there wasn't any generic replacement available and the dealer glass was the only one he could get a hold of.  His price on that was 3% less on the original company I'm still working with, but without any generic available I'm holding out hope for Monday.  With the price difference between the generic and the dealership Joe even offered to hold a post-dated check for the difference, which I also appreciated, but for now am not accepting.    Kudos to Joe for being quick, efficient, friendly, and honest today!

Sometimes writing is therapeutic in ending a relationship.  Spoken aloud, the name puts a grimace on my face, as once spoken with great joy now evokes deep regret.  For the last 4 months I've had permutations of this conversation with my wife:  "Hmmm I don't really feel like cooking." Me "Well we could order delivery." Wife.  Face begins to morph into the Why-do-I-put-up-with-you-face. "We could.  Orrrrrrrrrrrrr we could... wok in!  Ahahahahaha." Me "Why did I marry you." Wife. "Well if you need to, you can always wok out!  Ahahahahaha." Me THE GLARE. Wife.  With heart afloat with punny happiness, I approached this Chinese restaurant called Wok In.  Situated prominently on the corner of Sossaman and Main, a tinge of trepidation shook me as I noted that their signage had only a single letter working.  Eating at O isn't as fun as Wok In, but I figured the food should be what concerns me.  Walking up some steps that they kindly warn you about, I enter and the restaurant feels spacious, probably can seat 120-ish.  Pretty worn decor but no points off for that.  Momentary confusion as they have a order counter, but also full service seating.  Nice server with very cheerful disposition seats and takes drink order which is iced tea, which arrives very promptly.  I decide to try their egg drop soup, goi cuon, and bun cha gio thit nuong.  I don't quite remember, but I want to say everything was $2 except the bun, which was around $7.  After ordering the server asks me if I'm Vietnamese.  Sure am!  Clouds pass over the previously unrelenting sunny disposition as she swiftly departs to place my order.  Surprised, I take another look around my surroundings, and note the absence of any of my people.  Knowing many caucasians with excellent taste in asian cuisine, I shrug off the demographics and tell myself everything will be okay.    Egg drop soup arrives very promptly.  Its tolerable.  Less eggy than most but with lots of carrot, corn, some cabbage, flavor is a bit weak but veggies redeem it slightly.    Goi Cuon much more disappointing.  Stuffed with a lot of lettuce, bean sprout, and 3 shrimp between the 2 rolls. No pork. The sauce was pure bottled hoisin with some sprinkled peanuts on top.  Then my favorite cool noodle dish, Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong.  Normally this is a bright, herbaceous dish with slippery rice noodles, lots of herbs/veggies, and savory pork slices grilled + egg rolls.  The cha gio (fried egg roll) were really tasty, and grilled beef was nice enough, but the fish sauce was very watery, and lettuce was probably 30% of the volume of this dish.  Some good bits to this dish but overall unbalanced and depressing with the weak nuoc mam.  Well.  Time to walk up and pay for my food.  Server timidly asks if I liked the food.  She gets an unconvincing yea it was fine.  She can tell and quietly says goodbye.  I say good bye as well.  Good bye to the server, good bye to a fun pun that I can't use anymore as its just depressing to think of, good bye to a Chinese restaurant with Vietnamese owners who make bad Viet food, good bye to it all... I wok out.

Abandoned by my girlfriend for the evening as she frolicked wantonly in Scottsdale (okay, she went to watch a movie with her parents while I was at work), I struggled to find solace in uncooked fish.  Remembering there was a very highly rated restaurant next to the AMC on the way home, I decided to stop by and see if House was as good as reviewed, or if indeed, Everybody Lies.  Walking in, I was immediately nervous at myself being the lone diner at about 7pm on a Saturday night.  I considered pretending to have an emergency and declaring my girlfriend was going into labor, but I realized that could be a horrible thing to do, and perhaps it would not be good to tempt fate.  Buoyed by my resolve to not inflict copies of myself upon the world, I took in my surroundings, and was bemused by the relatively classy surroundings on my left with sleekly lined contours, contrasted to the relatively campy decor on my right right, with a wall that had a built in wave, and photos of their food with descriptions on colored paper.    Their menu has a nice variety of standard fare across the spectrum of Americanized aps to comfort Japanese food for non-sushi related items, but I was here for the fish!  I ordered an Iced tea along with Red Snapper + Yellowtail Nigiri to start.  Alas, though the fish was fine, the rice was constructed terribly and fell apart when coming into contact with the whisper of soy/wasabi that I attempted to apply.  Applying the mixture to my chopsticks and then unto the nigiri made do, but I couldn't help but be miffed at the reversed process I'm accustomed to.  Explanations of my girlfriend's theoretical triplets entering the world was on the tip of my tongue, but I decided to wait until the Tuna Karai made its appearance before attempting a classy exit.  Fortunately, my canceled deception was rewarded in the form of one of my favorite bites at a Japanese restaurant of all time.  The Tuna Karai was described to me as spicy tuna sashimi.  I feel that calling this spicy was dishonest, as a more accurate description would be that the world was ending early, with the hellfire gathering in my mouth beating the Mayan's predictions by about 9 months.  To save the world I swiftly consumed this dish, being duly grateful for the shaved daikon to nullify some of the heat, with bits of squid to provide some texture against the the yielding tuna.  One of the items on the wall caught my eye, as I can never resist calamari wherever I go. I was grateful they provided me with a half order, as I wanted a bit more sushi.  Their rendition of calamari was wonderfully airy tempura lacking in oiliness, with the accompanying wasabi mayo leaning towards wasabi as the dominant flavor, and the traditional tempura sauce that I preferred, being a well-executed version with a very mild sweetness, light body, yet dense umami flavor reminiscent almost of nuoc cham.  My desire to explore the Modern side of House led me to the Citea roll, humorously named as a tribute to a friend of the server who wanted a roll named after his clothing line.  If his clothing line satisfies me half as much as this roll did, I will drape myself in Citea apparel for a year.  Inside lurked spicy tuna with avocado, while above loomed seared salmon, masago, scallion, and chopped peanuts with eel sauce.  This was a wonderful dance of complementary flavors, while the peanuts and scallions added poignant counterpoints in rougher texture compared to the smoothness of the rest of the roll.  In lieu of desert, I opted for a final set of salmon nigiri.  I had expressed my disappointment of the previous order to my server, and happily I received a more tightly packed nigiri with avocado and lemon garnishes as well.  This was a pair of wonderfully buttery, vibrant bites to end my meal.  With 30% off rolls during traditional Happy Hour times I was also happy with the cost of my meal relative to how much I ate.    As I left, I couldn't help but notice the lines outside the chain restaurants around Stapley and Baseline, and the irritation pushed me to write my first review in months.  This is an excellent family run restaurant with lovely food + service that will provide you with a completely satisfying meal at a good price, and Yelpers should congregate to this location and partake in a  feverish frenzy of foodie bliss!

Can't think as currently trying to stay awake at work.  Remember coming here week ago.  Pressure cooked goat delicious, sauteed spinach soaked up flavors superbly, very uniquely spiced, dried grape skins base.   Black tea cold and refreshing, yogurt based drink will take some getting used to.  This will become a regular stop!

Fast food place, fast review time!  Shaved prime rib sandwich super tasty, cheese curds bite sized mozzarella sticks could use some kind of sauce, crinkle cut fries ordinary, cookie dough craving custard addicting, guilt at gluttony rising, honey badger don't care.

Quick review time at work!  Just Wow, absolutely amazing.  I've been coming here on Sundays for the last two months, and I've always had a great time, but today went to an even greater level.  Great adult hangout place, 4 hours of ping ping I played today and there was no pressure to leave or buy anything.  GM Jason came and checked in on us and was gracious, friendly, and would be a credit to any restaurant.  Had the Rainbow Trout at Culinary Dropout attached restaurant, beautifully cooked flaky with green beans/almondine sauce, one of my fav seafood dishes to order in AZ.

So life has been pretty stressful lately.  Gravity appears to becoming stronger, or I'm gaining weight.  Somebody is dying my perfectly black hair with some stray white ones.  My friends claim that I'm in denial, but they just don't realize I will never turn 30.  I have some wedding vows to write, and a tennis buddy insists that it will come to me at a sushi restaurant after 2 sake bombers, and I'm almost desperate enough to go that route.  North Korea seems to want to play with nukes.    But you know what really bothers me?  Zappone's Italian Bistro having only 3.5 stars.  Are you kidding me Arizona?  Fine, I'm getting older and gaining weight and graying out, fine I'll probably plagiarize somebody's vows online, fine another Korean War is inevitable, but no freaking way is Zappone's 3.5 stars.    We've been coming here since December, and probably been back about half a dozen times.  The interior is very smartly designed with a modernist look but also comfy booths and bar/counter top seating throughout.  The food is expertly made, and just tonight I had a gnocchi special that blew my mind- great chew on this freshly made pasta with every bite having a little uniqueness, coated with pancetta, onions, chili flakes, in a rich, slightly tart marinara sauce.  My fiancee had a lovely spinach ravioli special, that was Miss America pretty to look at but Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition satisfying.  Their house salad is a little different every time, this time sporting more sweet  peppers than normal but perfect for me, though YMMV.  Their calamari had a perfectly light breading, and extremely thinly sliced lemon was also battered and flash fried to make a perfect accompaniment to the marinara sauce.  Prior visits had the lasagna, tortellini, and spaghetti ala mare been extraordinarily enticing.    The only Italian restaurant I've had in the east valley that compares to Zappone's is La Calabria, and the cost is probably about half of theirs.  The staff has been ridiculously welcoming, and service has been comfortable yet still professional.  I've always had to drive a fair distance to get an Italian meal I really enjoyed, but am ecstatic that I've got a great restaurant about 2 miles away.  If you're still reading my review you must have a lot of patience, and you should reward yourself with a visit to Zappone's.  Be forewarned however, you might just fall in love with the food, write silly reviews, maybe even belittle the seriousness of Korean War part deux- and like me, find that it was all totally worth it.

I miss ya baby.  You were exotic and exciting and mysterious.  You opened me to a whole new world.  And of course, I didn't appreciate you enough and didn't pay enough attention and one day you were gone and I was heartbroken, wondering what I was going to do next, which turned out to be pick another one up on the other side of the highway, and continue my passionate affair.  With Afghani food of course!  Had a nice lunch today at this Afghani restaurant that opened two weeks ago. At the northeastern corner of Higley and Baseline, this space has been a revolving door of mediocre Indian buffets, but this restaurant I'm hoping is here to stay. First impression, I'm not going to miss Ariana's, which was a short-lived Afghani restaurant on the other side of the 60.  Tastefully decorated with mainstream music playing not too loudly, was a spacious place for lunch.  There was a 20 top that was seated shortly before us, so can't judge service too much, as it was probably around 30 minutes before we got our food. They proclaim proudly about a 72 hour marinade process and a custom made kebob grill thats supposed to be the bees knees.  With whatever you order you get a choice of different sides, amongst a salad bar, which although tiny had a nice assortment of add-ons, like chick peas, afghani pico, roasted red peppers, chutneys, and conventional stuff you'd expect as well.  Yummy times on the Lamb Kebobs! The skewer was removed from the meat, so although it looks small it still packs quite a punch (twhs) and was quite a filling meal. Tasty, lean lamby goodness, with a firm and satisfying mouthfeel!  The chutney was pretty tart, I liked it a lot, although I disagree with a previous comment about the spiciness. The little cup of pico de gallo Afghani style (haha I'm sure theres an actual name but too lazy to look it up) was tasty. Also I'm sure misnamed but the Tahini sauce was thinner then a greek one and more herbacious, quite delicious. The spinach accented basmati rice was fine but not noteworthy.  My wife had their GRILLER- Tikka kabob, grilled onions, grilled vegetables and creamy house sauce, had a few bites and was quite tasty. Their naan bread they used for the wrap is thicker and almost wheatier then anything I've had before, kinda neutral on it but worked as an acceptable conveyance of the deliciousness inside.  Has only been opened two weeks so will continue to explore what they offer, pretty wide assortment of items on their menu, with some vegetarian entrees for those so inclined.
