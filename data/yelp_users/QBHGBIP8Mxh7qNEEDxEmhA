I like coming here because they give out great two for one coupons! The food is average, but it's breakfast, what more would you expect from a meal you can easily prepare your self! The service is always the same, happy waitresses that understand what it's like to work hard and know that your just hungry and want a no BS meal.  I come here about twice a month and enjoy it every time.

The food (catfish) is beyond good and the hospitality is even better. Stopped in with the family on a Friday night and was surprised with the friendliness of the staff, I think her name was Billy? We ordered our food and it came out very quick and was absolutely delicious! We definitely will call this our new place to get BBQ in the Tempe area from now on. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.

Super clean room, and for $118 my family had extra money to spend having fun! We will definitely use this hotel again when we come back. Only thing that bugged me was the coffee was not brewing at the 7-11am they had posted, but there was a coffee maker in the room that wasn't all half bad. If your looking to save a little cash, and not worried about not being exactly on the strip, check this place out.

Easily the best food in Tempe!  The customer service is top notch,  your treated like family here. I've had just about everything on the menu and it would be hard to pick the best, but try the Adana kebab!

Dustin is the man to see if you want only the best cut and dye available in town. He hooked it up for both myself and my lady. Im impressed and im a guy, my girl on the other hand said she hasnt looked better in years!  Plus, he is one of the nicest down to earth dudes ive ever met. Do yourself and your image a favor--go see Dustin, I promise you wont be let down!

Definitely check this shop out if your looking to get that cut it trim that all the cool kids are getting! ;)  I always see Justin, but each of the 6 Barbars have awesome skills and are super professional.  They also have awesome art on the walls.  Check, check, check them out!

Only two check out lanes open at a time...  This place is the worst Walmart in all of Arizona! Avoid this place if you can,  go to target next door!

I have been here 3 times now and I am always greeted with genuine customer service and a smile. They always take great care of my vehicles and I'm never left unsatisfied.  There prices are more than affordable and your never left with a sour taste in your mouth like some places.  I recommend this places to my friends and family and they have all thanked me for it. I'm a family man, and I trust them to repair my vehicles. Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed!

This place is extremely filthy! Nearly every table had food on it, and the floors looks as if they haven't been swept or mopped in days. With the state of chaos that restaurant had in the dining room, really makes you wonder what the conditions the food was cooked in. Never coming back again.

This place is so inconsistent!  Sometimes the food is OK, other times like to today the Burrito is small and has FROZEN LETTUCE inside of it! There is a new employee every single time I go in as well. I wonder why?  Definitely try another place.

The #1 shop in the valley!  Great juice, great hardware and over the top customer service and satisfaction!  Most shops in the valley are all carbon copies of each other. THIS SHOP IS LIKE NO OTHER!!  Your greeted as soon as you walk in, and within a minute you feel like your part of a family.  Whether your a vape hobbyist, or a smoker trying to better your life, your treated the same. BUTT OUT is even fun to go to if your not a vaper.   If your in the market of getting taken advantage of,  keep shopping else's where,  if you want value and an 90 days guarantee Butt Out is the only place for you!

Awesome selection that gets bigger and bigger!  Even if your not a "rock star"  this place is for you. Probably the nicest staff of any retail shop in the whole Valley and they live the life.   Diffently not a waste of time to check in here and see what's new.

It's 5:30 on a Saturday, the door was locked and I couldn't get in. I've heard good things about this place, but because it's was closed when it's posted that it's open was a big inconvenience to me. I will definitely re-think taking time out of my day to visit this place again.
