First & last time eating here! Service was absolutely horrible. Food took forever because staff was messing around. We were the only ones in the restaurant.  Make sure you check your order! We got the food to go and every sandwich was wrong and didn't have the condiments we ask for. Place is a joke.

Had Christmas business dinner last night and all I can say is Simply the BEST! This place puts any steak house around to shame. Well done from start to finish.
