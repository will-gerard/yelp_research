I heard great things about this restaurant but after reading the reviews it sounds like the other location is the place to be.   I went to this location with some co-workers at lunch time. There wasn't much business, so we thought it should fairly easy. The server messed up our food, bringing the wrong dish out to someone, and I became suspicious when the chicken parm was ready only minutes later after taking it back to the kitchen. I had ordered the lobster ravioli and found that whatever they stuffed the ravioli with was not good lobster, or was mixed with something that did not compliment the lobster. The inside was very spongy and I suspect these were actually frozen ravioli's instead of fresh made. The ravioli's themselves were also overcooked and mushy and drowning in a plate of sauce. I was also not expecting to pay $17.99 for lobster ravioli, not to mention my bill came to over $20 with my iced tea. I will say out cheesy garlic bread that comes with the meal was good.   I would probably not come back to this location however, I would be willing to try the location in Chandler.

I LOVE Rosati's... here's a little history...   When I was little we used to eat at one in Chicago and then we moved to Arizona. When my dad saw there was one on Warner road he was thrilled. Years later when I was old enough, I worked at Rosati's for 4 years (all throughout high school) and ate there as much as possible. For anyone who has worked in the restaurant business, you know the food is good when the staff eats there whether they are working or not.   I recently introduced my boyfriend to Rosati's and he is now hooked too!!   The food is always delicious, we've never had an incorrect order, it's always hot and on time, and they simply never disappoint. All of the ingredients are FRESH and everything there is handmade. Keep in mind this is CHICAGO pizza, so if you don't know what that is, don't like it, or are expecting something different, you may have a different opinion.   Whether you want a pizza, an Italian beef, lasagna, you name it, it's all delicious at this restaurant!!   On a personal note, I can say that the years I worked there it was family and I'm willing to bet Scott Selke still treats his staff as such. Great food, great owners, and great memories!

I am amazed at the high reviews this place receives. While yes, the food was wonderful, the atmosphere makes it completely unenjoyable.   First of all, it's obvious this place is a local watering hole, not a fine dining establishment and therefore, not worth the $130 I put down for my boyfriend's birthday dinner.   The only waitress in there that didn't seem to be loaded was our server and many of the female staff members didn't seem to have any issue with getting groped and fondled by the fellas at the bar. Put it this way, it wasn't surprising that this place is across the street from a strip club. The inside of the restaurant felt sleazy and I definitely would not return here. We even watched one family get up and leave the restaurant after having to listen to Guns n Roses blast and their server pour ice all over the floor in a daze. When she walked away they left. Had it not been for what amazing things we heard about the food we would have been leaving right behind them.   Had I wanted to eat dinner at a dive bar, I would have done so and certainly would have paid a lot less.

For years a friend of mine has been trying to get me into a Bikram class with her at this studio and I have refused, afraid I would pass out or become nauseated from the heat. However, this last weekend I finally took the plunge!!   Walking into the studio I was immediately greeted by Shyam who told me what I could expect, where my focus should be, and overall tips for me to feel successful after the 90 minutes was up. He explained the main goal was to just stay in the room, whether I did yoga for the entire 90 minutes or not. Shyam was very good about helping me throughout the class so I understood the proper poses and how to breathe. He was very encouraging and made me feel calm.   Drop in classes are $17 or you can purchase your first month for only $29. I went ahead and bought my first month at $29, knowing that even if I only go one more time I would already be saving money.   I plan to return to this studio over the next month on a regular basis.

Office staff was very friendly and helpful and they were able to accommodate my schedule. The individual who helped me with my glasses knew I would be going out of town the following weekend and even offered to put a rush order on my glasses with no extra charge. Dr. Jason McCord was very friendly and will be happy to visit him again in the future for my eye needs. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is I wish this office had a little more of a selection available for frames.

Dr. Ross and his staff are a primary care office like no other. The level of care, patience, and time devoted to each person is just about unheard of in today's world. Anytime I have gone into Dr Ross he spends quality time asking me about my physical and mental health, habits, activity, and so on so he can be sure he has a well-rounded understanding of my life. He remembers things from past visits and follows up on any questions or concerns I might have. I have even got a personal phone call from him to check on an issue that I had so he could make sure that I felt I had the answers I needed.   I have referred several people to Dr Ross and will continue to do so. I only wish there were more doctors and office staff like his wellness center. Every single person in this office is simply amazing!

This place is awesome!   I've been waxed several times always at different places trying to find someone or some place that I could be happy with and I've finally found it!   First of all, the wax used does not require cloth strips, so it allows a better contact with the skin. They also prep your skin and hair before the waxing begins so they can be sure to get maximum hair grabbage. And the best thing, it barely hurt! I know, it sounds unbelievable, but it really was relatively pain free.   The waxer I had was named Erika and I will definitely be going back to her. She is super anal retentive, which is great for me as a customer because it means she got every stray hair there was to get. I was so happy with the results I bought a package of 12 and will continue to go back there.   The pricing was also great and was far less than any pricing I have experienced before at a nail salon, spa salon, or waxing specialist.   I will be making another appointment within the next week for another area of my body.

Terrific Thai food and a huge hit in our office. While they are always busy, the food is always on time and made just right. Never had a bad experience here. My only disappointment is they no longer delivery during lunch hours, only dinner hours. This place really has been booming over the last couple of years!

This place is amazing food and the best New Mexican food you can find in the valley. I have had several menu items but my two favorites are carne asada burrito smothered in green chili sauce and the chili relleno with ground beef, smothered in green chili sauce.   New Mexican Grill also has great breakfast burritos and are always willing to take our very large work orders and always get our order right.   Super friendly staff and prompt with food!

I love coming to Standup Live! Last night my friends and I went to see Dom Irrera (who was hysterical by the way, as was the opening act!) and we were not disappointed. First off, the tickets were free because my name was drawn for their give away, we had great seats, great service, and great food.  Our server did an awesome job informing us about the $30 special which covers the two drink minimum, an appetizer, a main course, and a desert. This reduced my bill by about $15 from what I would normally pay. I'll definitely do this option in the future.  If you have not checked out this comedy club I would highly recommend it.

I am on my third week of visits to Orthopedic Sports Therapy and I am loving it!! I have suffered from lower back pain from years, sometimes worse than others, and on my first visit here Amy (my physical therapist) answered a lot of questions I had about my body and bone structure. I have been going 2 to 3 times per week and I am starting to see a difference, each week adding a new exercise and stretch to my routine. Amy is completely in tune with my needs and what my body is telling her, I am amazed how often she can locate the source of my pain and assist.   I feel confident that I am being provided solutions that I will be able to use over the course of my life to treat my pain.

I recently found this restaurant when I was having a hankering for some good spaghetti and meatballs. I work in East Mesa and am not terribly familiar with mom & pop places nearby. I was blown away by how good this to-go order was! The pasta was al dente and the sauce was absolutely delicious. It also came with a generous portion of bread and a salad, all for a very reasonable price... about $10.   My next trip was only a week later (today) when I ordered the prosciutto and arugula panini. This sandwich is to die for! If you're a fan of this salty meat, you will not find a better one around. It is topped with provolone cheese, roasted red peppers, arugula, and a red wine vinegarette. I also received a side of potato chips which taste and appear to be homemade. Total came to $9.29 after tax.  There are many other items on the menu I would like to try. While some items are more expensive than others, keep in mind there is a lunch specials menu to choose from.   This will definitely be a new go-to place for me!

Being the soup lover that I am, I totally love this place! If you going during the typical business lunch hour, don't be alarmed by the long line, they work through it at an impressive rate and the staff is always friendly. There are at least two staff members walking around on the floor cleaning up to make sure there are always clean dining tables for guests.   My favorite soup they have is the roasted red pepper with lobster, followed up by the mushroom or Wisconsin cheese soup. The best part is you get a chocolate covered strawberry with every meal. Love it!

This place is AWESOME!! I've been coming here for a few years now and I have never had anything that wasn't spectacular. My favorite salad is the Cobb with either chicken or steak. The homemade soup is so flavorful and the staff members are incredibly friendly. I can't believe what a large salad you can get for such a low price. I work in East Mesa so I can go here during the week however, there have been times that even on the weekend I have made the trek from Tempe just for the food here. Looking forward to one opening in Tempe someday!!

My best friend introduced me to this place and I love it!! There are so many healthy options and even more options to choose from if you are wanting to cater your meal to a specific diet, such as paleo-friendly.   The food tastes fresh, not frozen or pre-packaged, and are generous portions. So while the cost is sometimes a little high ($10-$12), the amount of food you are getting is well worth it. There have been times I've taken mine home and had enough for another meal.   The lemonades and juices are also delicious!   I love the outdoor patio as it feels like a little picnic area, quiet and quaint where you can watch the people go by. It contributes to the great community feeling often found in downtown Tempe.

I'm giving this place 5 stars for two reasons:   1.) I love the food. It's my guilty pleasure.   2.) I just had an incorrect order (hey, it happens everywhere!) and the General Manager, Robert, handled it like a boss! He took care of my issue right away & was very apologetic. You can tell this guy is great at customer service!!

The other day I was in so much pain in my lower back, glutes, and legs from a work out a few days prior that I could barely sit at my desk - I was so uncomfortable! I called Elements since they are near my work and they were able to get me in on very short notice.  My therapist was Terri and she was AWESOME!! Now Terri does not usually specialize in deep tissue massage but you never would have guessed it! She hit every trigger point possible and each time she did I felt my muscles get looser and looser. I was so grateful for how hard she worked on me.  I would definitely go again and I would highly recommend Terri!

Glad this place finally opened! It's my first time and I got the Soleri salad. I wasn't sure about the unsweetened chocolate in the salad, but it's actually very good! My only disappointment is I had hoped for a slightly larger salad then what is considered the large salad. I'm looking forward to trying more delicious food from this place!
