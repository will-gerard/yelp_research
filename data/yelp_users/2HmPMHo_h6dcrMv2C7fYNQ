Reminded me of home. Good food. Service was a little slow but in the Midwest people don't rush so gave you even more that Midwest experience.

Went there for a new holster as I wanted to start carrying. Very informative and helpful. They helped me pick the perfect one for me as I didn't know the first thing about them.

Sports bar?  I went there to watch a NFL playoff game. They a retirement party taking up all the seats in the front and in the back were about 6 tables playing poker. Finally found a table in the back and service was extremely slow and club music playing. Asked the waitress two different times if could get the sound of the game since it is a sports bar. She said they are working on it. So went to ask the bartender and rudely responded  they play the sound of the game up front and music in the back. Clearly if there were seats in the front would of sat up there. I asked if this is a sports bar or a club. Response "any other complaints."

I used to love this place but have read on here that it is under new management. The are smaller and it does not taste anywhere how the rolls used to taste. They were so good but now they are horrible!  Service is great and only reason giving it two stars. Not going back!!

Really like this place. They have always done a great job. Finally made the switch after Super Cuts was always hit or miss.

Had a horrible tat from college :-) Wanted a cover up to honor my dad, something with the kids and Steelers combined. From the moment I walked him I felt welcomed. Very clean and nice studio. Worked with the artist Jen. She listened to my ideas and created a master piece. THANK YOU JEN!! LOVE IT!!  Would highly recommend this studio and Jen. All the employees were very friendly when I was there getting this tattoo done.

Used Couple of Bartenders for our wedding and am glad I did. Kelsey was great at getting everything organized and planning before the wedding. On the day of the event we had KC as the bartender and he did an amazing job. Very happy and always smiling at the wedding. Highly recommend this company!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! I first to my car to another shop and they told me the gears needed replaced = $1,500. I then called AZ Differential and they said they could do it cheaper. Went down there and they test drove it and said pretty sure it is only the bearings. They took it apart and it was only the bearings = $600. Got to love an honest shop!  Granted the shop may not look the best on the outside but the "prettier" shops have to pay for the somehow = taking advantage of customers.

Some of the best BBQ that I have ever had. I had the three meat platter - ribs, pulled pork and brisket. All delicious!! Service as A+. Would definitely recommend trying. Place was smaller than expect but we were seated right away.

Highly recommended!!!  I went in on a Monday night and was leaving for Vegas Wednesday afternoon. They busted their behinds to get it done. The engagement ring turned out amazing. The customer service by Lance and Brent were beyond 5 stars. Please check out House of Diamonds if thinking about purchasing rings.

Omg!!  Pizza is to die for!  This place has a great atmosphere and their food was amazing. Try the garlic fries and meatballs too. Definitely going back when we go back to Vegas.

We went to this location and got $20 worth of food and drinks. We ordered all the fixings. We were asked 2x and advised both times we wanted all the fixings. We get home 15 min away and the sandwiches have nothing on them. We called and spoke the manager Lisa. She told us to come back in to have the sandwiches remade. We aren't driving back 15 min one way then back home again another 15 min for fixings on a sandwich that should of been done right the first time. We requested a credit. She put us on hold and after several minutes she told us she talked to the owner and they said to come back in. Once again we aren't driving 30 min to get what should of been right the first time!!  Very disappointed as a big fan of firehouse subs.
