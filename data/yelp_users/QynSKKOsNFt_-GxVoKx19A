Tami at Wisemagic is incredible! She's done 2 of my 4 tattoos and I will never go anywhere else! She was patient when I had her stop a billion times while doing my side ribcage and was super nice. Customer for life!

I LOVE this place, it brings out my inner fat kid.  I always get the Old Timer Breakfast and finish it all (which is shocking because I never finish anything). The staff is always super friendly and the food always comes out hot and fast. Their bacon is amazing-soft and chewy and their hash brown casserole is excellent. Can't wait to go back!

Wooot for "grown up slushies!"  This place is a staple of my Vegas adventures and was just as fun in AZ.  We hit Happy Hour for cheap drinks & apps after an expensive Octoberfest. Lord please forgive me for the extra shots of everclear on top...$1 floaters...they should be ashamed of themselves...sinful...I LOVEDDD it!

No very impressed. Service wasn't great and the food took forever. I could tell the server knew we were unhappy and kept "overly trying" to help us and it ended up being annoying. We won't be back...

I love coming here! Everyone is always super nice when I come in and I never feel pressured into any service. The tech Erick has worked on my tires a few times and is always so nice! Thanks for the great service!

Ew, Mables gave me a Pretty Woman complex! Walking around Old Town Scottsdale at 4pm, a group of 7 of us (very well-dressed) walked into Mables looking to have drinks & lunch. Before we even close the door the bartender yells rudely "NO, SORRY YOU DON'T MEET DRESS CODE, NO HATS OR SLEEVE-LESS SHIRTS. BYE!"  Excuse meeee?! "I have money to spend here!" Oh Julia Roberts, where were you when we needed you...big mistake..HUGE. We ended up going to R&R and having a great time.

Duce's Wild! Me and 4 girlfriends came here Saturday for drinks and food and had a blast! All the drinks were made with fresh ingredients, my favorite has to be the Cherry Sidecar made with strawberries. You can't taste the alcohol but I was feeling great once we left  The d√©cor is very vintage and unique. I highly recommend this place especially for a big group.

I love going here, it's fun spot! The Ciroc Redberry Rapture is amazing (low-cal too!) and so is the grilled pretzel bread! I highly recommend checking it out!

I went here on a Saturday and was VERY excited to see they had happy hour. We had the shrimp appetizer, which was fantastic and The Fix (amazing drink and very inexpensive). The bartender was super nice and friendly, we will defiantly be back (for happy hour).

Never heard of the place, thought we'd give it a try... The burger's coal taste is defiantly acquired and the sweet potato fries were dull and lacked flavor. We were left very disappointed. Our server was friendly but we won't be back.

I LOVEDDD this place!  Went here for a friend's birthday one night and sat on the patio. It was very nice & intimate. The waitress was super nice.  The food was fantastic. The cheese fondue was very fun and the griddle church potatoes...stop it...INCREDIBLE!

We went here to see Russell Peters at a 7pm showing recently. He was awesome but the venue was disappointing. The menu did not have drink prices which was odd since they ENFORCE the 2 drink minimum (that I feel is lame since we are already shelling out $$$ for tickets AND parking). We had the bruschetta...which was pita bread with a side of watery tomatoes...in a bowl. Ew. I babysat my first drink because I didn't like it and the server came up to me AT LEAST 5 times within 20 minutes to ask for my second drink order. Rude.

WOW! This place is great! From the vibe to the dessert, I have NO complaints! The drinks were amazing and the bartender was great. The Lobster Mac n Cheese and Chicken alla Vodka were incredible! I can't wait to go back!

This place is AWESOME! Very fun atmosphere! A large group of us went here for my birthday. Brian the manager was super nice & hooked us up with a cabana for free. The pool area was great and the food was really good. All the drinks were buy 1 get 1 and the margaritas were EXCELLENT! We all will defiantly be back!

I went to Olive for the first time yesterday & saw Marissa for a cut & color. My color was fading and hair completely damaged. Marissa blew me out of the water, she really knows her stuff! The color she picked was incredible! She offered great advice on ways to keep it healthy and recommended amazing products. I'm very picky so I'm VERY thankful I found someone I can trust! Thanks Marissa, I'll def be back!

This place has great happy hour and on a SATURDAY! Apps and certain rolls were half off too. Very nice place, can't wait to try it again for dinner.
