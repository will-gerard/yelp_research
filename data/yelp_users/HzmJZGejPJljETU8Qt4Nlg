We just moved to the neighborhood and went yesterday for happy hour. The atmosphere is awesome for any occasion. The service was friendly and quick. The food was outstanding! My husband had the Mexican pizza, I had the lettuce wraps, & our friend had the mini chimis (they have a different name on the menu like chingalinga). Nothing was too spicey and after I left I didn't feel overfull or have a stomach ache which is rare bc I'm pregnant. The chips are literally to die for!! I'm thinking of walking over just to buy a bag to take home.!

The people working here were so sweet and friendly! They were super quick with making my lunch also! My protein salad was huge and delicious! Super fresh.. The dressing tasted homemade. This place is definitely going to be a new favorite for me! They have me 6 free bagels with my check in.. I bought some whipped honey peanut butter to take with me and I am beyond happy! This place made my day!

First of all, Rumor and Artisan are like apples and oranges to begin with but there is nothing like when you arrive to a hotel as well priced as this and they are happy to see you! The staff here, housekeepers, Michael (front desk), bartenders, everyone that works here has a great attitude and that makes a HUGE difference. They remember my name, The rooms are eclectic and cool! The shower broke in our room so they upgraded us to a huge suite for the same price and offered to help us move. This would NEVER happen at Rumor (they should take note). Besides that the after hours and everything else has been awesome. I will stay here many more times!!

This is by FAR the best Chinese in Arizona. I've been going here for almost 8 years and the food gets better every time I go there! Robby, the bartender, is a great guy! If your from out of town, this is a place to check out!!! The orange chicken & lettuce wraps are amazing. This is a great date place that will be easy on your wallet, and the service is amazing! Love this place!!

They have the best selection for Vegetarian Rolls I have ever seen, They are creative and unbelievably delicious! I just added Cream Cheese to the Sweet Potato roll.. and it was sooo yummy! They should think about putting that on the menu. Also they were SUPER friendly & quick to help me since I only had 1/2 hour to eat and get to Chandler. I didn't even have to tell them that... they were just very attentive without being pushy. I would recommend this place over Sting Ray & RA in Scottsdale. The only drawback is their location. They should have either more locations... One in old town or in North Scottsdale would be awesome!

This place needs to be inspected by the board of cosmetology!!! It looked clean and new but when a place that big had not even one customer on a Friday afternoon... There is a pretty good chance it's a chop shop. The older man that did my pedi started laughing at me after burning me  with the callas remover. I had to go on vacation the whole weekend with band aids all over my feet. WARNING!!my feet were cracked, painful, and downright ugly after this nightmare!! I wouldn't recommend sending anyone here even if they were my worst enemy!!!!!

I really want to Thank Scott at Distinct detail. He really went above and beyond to make one of my worst nightmares (buying a car on Ebay and it arriving smelling as if someone had chain smoked with the windows up since it was brand new in 2007) into a HUGE relief! He was especially accommodating to both of our schedules and took our car on his own personal time when the actual shop was too booked up to fit us in! He is a VERY hard worker and even had his son out there helping out when I came to pick the car up. He was very knowledgeable as well! I love a family owned business where a son wants to follow in his dads footsteps. I also love how amazing my car looked! It literally looked like a different brand new car! He told me right off the bat after asking him if he would put that new car smell into it that he did not want to mask it, but get rid of it completely. The paint was so shiny and sparkly you could tell that they put their heart & soul into their work and they WILL stand behind it!  Scott followed up with me several times to make sure that I am happy with my car and even did an extra smell treatment a couple months later just to make sure that it was absolutely up to his standards which completely exceeded mine! I appreciate you guys really going the extra mile to make my Volvo so pretty and NOT smelly! This was after a cold call as well... I did not have a referral or any recommendations from anyone I knew. My husband found them on Google and this is the treatment we recieved! I will recommend them to everyone and anyone who wants a TRUE detail of their vehicle!
