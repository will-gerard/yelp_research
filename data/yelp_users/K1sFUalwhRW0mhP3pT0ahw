I will never come to this native ever again. First we sit down and order the drinks but our waitress forgets till after we are almost done with our appetizers.  Thats was okay....maybe she was having a bad night...  Then she brings us the wrong order and says thats what we ordered...honestly I order the same thing every single time...  She keeps making it sound like its our fault... Okay...  Then when we are done eating, we stacked our plates to show her that we were ready to pay... But she sat in the corner with other servers getting a shoulder massage...wth.   So my husband walks up to her to ask for the check on his way to use the restroom.  As i waited...my husband comes back and still no check.   In the meantime the server goes to the table behind us and chats with the customer about their favorite drinks...THEN tosses the check over my husbands shoulder onto the table without any words!!! WTF!

I had always loved TohZan. They have THE best  Miso Ramen. Sometimes its a bit salty but the food is truly good and authentic.  Also, they give you lots of sides and they are also good too!

One stars only cause ONE maintenance guy is great!  This apartment has been an nightmare. No joke I have been having the worst experience. Scorpions, bugs, and dirty never cleaned community pools.  The pool water is literally green.

Personally, I had bad service here every time... I usually don't complain at restaurants because I have been in restaurant business before and I know how hectic it gets. But when a customer states that their food was super bland and it has no seasoning what so ever, you make them a new dish, not reheat the same dish with some salt in it. Make the matter worse, put it in the same plate that it came in and hope the customer doesn't notice.  My biggest problem with this place is that it is DIRTY. The table is sticky all the time and the whole restaurant is dusty.  You will see the piled up grease and dust on the glass window next to the tables.   One particular incident I had was they had not cleaned the grill table in a long time that, I had old black grease drip onto my jeans from under the table!    I'm not sure how much has changed since the last time time I had been there, maybe I will try it again one day...

This place has a sit yourself sign in the front. Sat down for about 15 mins, then a guy(seemed like a busboy) comes over to ask what we would like to drink.   After few mins, the guy comes back with drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  Everything seems normal...EXCEPT we had never got our menus. hahaha...   Then we got another server Brianna I believe. She was very sweet and helpful!  Food came out perfectly as we ordered.   Except for the sit yourself no menu issue, I had good food and great service!

I came in for some pain in my ear.  The stuff are friendly but very slow... It took me an hour and half for the doctor to come to the room, and another 20 mins for the stuff to let me go... Idk about you but i have a child and i can not be spending 2 hours in the urgent care... It should be urgent. Not take your time...

I have to admit some of the smoothy is hit or a miss. But my overall fav is the pineapple slushy. Its made with real pineapples and it tastes awesome!   The bathroom may need a little work for kids but what do you really expect from a small old building.  Regardless service is nice, drinks are good, and the diamond ice is old fashion korean style which is hard to find anywhere these days.

I heard of this place from a friend and finally decided to go to take out.  First of all, their menus is HUGE. Good thing they have lots of pics on the wall.   So, I like to order a lot of things when I first visit a place.  Monday, I ordered Szechuan Spicy Water Boil Fish, Chili Salt Chicken Wings, Peking Pork Rib, Salt & pepper squid and combo chowfun.   It was so good that I went back on Wednesday and tried the orange chicken bowl and combo fried rice.    Most asians NEVER order orange chicken when they go eat chinese food. But I dare to try after seeing the picture.  BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!!!!!!! Their orange chicken is AMAZING! better than Panda. Also, its only like $4!   Price, portion, and quality of food is Amazing!

Ive visited this place many times over the years. Here are my findings.  Pro:  1. The decor is clean and very vibrant which is rare to find in Korean restaurant 2. Very well organized.  Cons: 1. Because the size of the restaurant, when its busy its crowded and the servers get overwhelmed. 2. Mixed up orders many times. 3. Banchan is the same every time.

I came here for the first time last Sunday because I received a GC. feeling a bit skeptical due to all the negative reviews...  First of all, the staff is very friendly. Prompt and nice... But that's about the only thing that was great.   I had ordered a Ginger Calamari, Misoyaki Salmon, & Macau Shrimp and noodle soup with Salmon...  The calamari was very salty I didnt need the dipping sauce... My Misoyaki Salmon and Macau Shrimp and noodle soup with Salmon was so bland...   Worst of all my Misoyaki salmon still had a piece of wax paper grilled on to the bottom of my salmon they had failed to take off.   When I let the server know... He talked to the manager and decided that they will take off the appetizer off our bill...??? $16.50 Salmon =$9.50 Calamari (is that even?)   I honestly did not complain to take things off the bill because I rather use up all my $100 GC and never come back here... But it made me a little upset how he handle the situation.   Anyways, overall server was very nice so I give them 2 Star.

Ive been a fan of mido for a while, not because of their food but because of the fast quick service.  But this past week, when i visited will be the last time i will ever go here...  First i walk in with my son who is now 11 months old.   Stood there by the door for a while until someone i asked how many...I asked for a table for 3 and a baby. Which normally mean highchair. I was told to sit in a empty table by the wall.   I sat down. After alittle over 15 mins, no high chair, no water, no menu... I admit the place was busy and packed. But that is no excuse for not even looking at the customer and asking for a drink.  Another 10 mins or so passed, i finally got the highchair and got to order drink. Not hard, hot tea and water.  Hot tea came by another waitress but no water...  Even after my dates came, we waited another 20mins or so to order!  I got to the restaurant at 7 and got to order at 8:10ish! Not only that, we never got miso, salad or edamame which is included in the all you can eat.  I asked for the soup twice for my son, nope... No soup. The sushi arrive and we ate most of that since we waited so much!   Then she gave us the check no questions asked... Really? You wanna take our money after non existent service?   I will not be going to mido ever again.

This review is for the lady who works in the same salon. I asked for a ash blonde hair color. What she gave me was a nightmare.  I explained to her that the color she gave me is not right and she kept insisting that it is gonna fade and turn into that color... WRONG. She gave me copper highlights which i didn't even ask for! Not even a good one at that! It was like chunk of my hair on top is copper and the middle is brown and the end is copper...WTF.   see pic attached. I will never be going here for her again.

The service here is HORRIBLE..   First I walk in and asked one of the guy regarding my phone because the button on top does not work. Then he told me to go to the front and find a guy with the red ipad...WTF red ipad right?  The while i was walking to the front, the girl that stands in the middle doesnt even ask what we need & just puts her hand out and says do you have an appointment? We said no, we are just looking for someone who can help us with the problem.  So the girl says, you need to get in line to make an appointment. Which we did...  There must been about 2 people in front of us.  When we got to the front, in like 5 mins, she asks if we have an appointment again. Of course we said no, AGAIN. "well we are all out of appointment time today, you need to go online to set one." WTF. seriously, she made us wait in line just to tell us that we need to go online to make an appointment because they are all booked?!  HORRIBLE SERVICE!

I've came here several times and EVERY TIME its not dusted, washed and vacuumed all the way! and their slow.  Seriously, its waste of your money. I get so annoyed when they come by where I work to sell coupons. I tell them their services are not worth my money.

Holy crap, out of all restaurant I picked this place.   Food: the Mongolian rice was hard and the veges was not cooked at all. Orange chicken was so nasty, it should be called bell pepper chicken not orange.   Serivce: let's say the girl was not very responsive.  But I do give 2 stars for the manager being so polite and letting us know how everything worked.   Overall I probably would not be returning.

cheese curd and coleslaw. I know, its a weird combo but i like that the best so far!  I tried the shrimp dinner that came with butterflied shrimp, dinner roll, fries, cole slaw. With a side of cheese curd.   Ive always like their cheese curds, its like cheese stick but bite size:)  The shrimp dinner is nothing special, but the cole slaw that came with it is surprisingly good!

I must have been here about 5 times the past couple of months. (im preggo and I crave steak A LOT!) First of, the service here is good. The servers are friendly and prompt. I wish I remember the gal's name...She served us twice in a row already...  Last time we visited was last night for dinner. I ordered the Flo's Filet w/ rice pilaf  & my husband had ordered the porterhouse  w/ rice pilaf. With an extra side of Mac & Cheese.  We order the same thing every time and like always mine came out perfect!   As for my husband, his porterhouse steak came out well done when it was requested to be medium.  We let the server know and she immediately replaced it with another steak probably within 10-15 mins. Which was very impressive! But the second steak was very salty and over seasoned... After we were done eating, the manager comes by to see how everything was and apologized for the 1st mistake and how the second one was. which we explained.  The manager offered us a complimentary desert to take him which we gratefully denied. (We were very full)  Overall- This one time mistake will not stop us from giving this location a 5 star! The servers are sweet and prompt and the food is almost ALWAYS great!

I absolutely love jimmy & joe pizza. Lets just say papa johns, pizza hut, etc has nothing on them.  The prices are fairly cheap, the amount is crazy, and the taste is amazing!!!   I love their buffalo chicken pizza:)

I have been here 2 times already and here is how my  experiences went. First visit: when I first visited the newly opened restaurant it wasnt so busy because it was the day after thanksgiving. The service was awesome and the food was not overly amazing but enough for me to come back. My husband and I had ordered the fried calamari, fried catfish, pound of king crab, pound of shrimp,  and a pound of crawfish. We wanted to try as much as possible. The server recommended that we try the trifecta flavor cause its good. So we ordered everything that flavor. Only to find out that what she had recommended was not what she ordered.  Crawfish was ordered in a different flavor. Which we didnt complaint about.  So everything went fine, nothing too big.   Here comes the second visit: I walked into the restaurant exactly 8:00. I had a party of 20 so I expected to wait since it was busy. Up to ths point, I was okay because they were busy. When we finally ordered it was 9.. 30 mins after we ordered, the waiter tells us no more chicken tenders for the kids. Okay, they were really busy earlier we assumed, but 30 mins to check and tell us? Whatever. Another 20 mins past,  I finally asked after waiting over 50 mins, by then we had finished my king crab legs, where is our cod fish fry and our fried calamari? Then he goes into the kitchen and comes back saying "we are out of calamari" are kidding me?! After almost and hour after we ordered, you tell us now? Are you trying to make money? I figured they would want to order more since they stated in the menu, 18% gratuity for a party of 8 or more. Whatever again. By this time 3/4 of the restaurant is empty!!  Even with this horrible service, we got charged gratuity which we didnt complain about.   Over all angry crab, the food is good when they are not busy but the service is horrible. If you want to go eat here make sure its not at a dinner rush time and don't EVER go in large party.

I love sushi J.  It was my first time visiting~  The saying, "dont judge a book by its cover" is right!   Its very modern and clean inside and I love the layout of the restaurant.  I tried the Friday night fever, sashimi, and the udon! I absolutely loved it:)

I had the worst experience with Big Two.   Few weeks ago, I had gotten a flat tire due to the road hazard.  My car is about 10 months old. When I called Toyota to find out if I had tire warranty cause I didn't remember. They transferred me to the service specialists because the front desk at services didnt know or has authority to see. So i waited on the phone on the side of the street for about 5 mins.  When someone finally came on, they told me they have no idea so someone will call me later. I asked them  1. Should go there to find out? No, we are booked...cant get you in.  2. How long should I wait? We don't know. 3. So how would I know if Im covered to get a new tire? Im not sure, you can wait for their call....  Are you serious? Am I supposed to wait on the side of the street for them to call me? They cant tell whether my "Platinum" Toyota care has tire warranty? Why did I pay over $1200 to buy this non-existing service?  its been 10 days and I still did not receive a call.   I am seriously thinking about selling my car because of the service I received.

I tried this place for the first time last Sunday. Their menu is huge!   We were attracted by their honey boba but it was all out! So we had to get the vanilla, which just tasted like the regular but white.

The sweet and mild chicken was surprisingly good!  They are currently running a grand opening special of 20% off which was nice:)   One flaw is that the chicken had a lot of small bones that can be a choking hazard.  Other than that everything was good.
