2 stars for the service and speed, but don't expect inteligent cuisine. Quick and easy, not good and cheap.

Atmosphere is wonderful. Outside patio dining with powerful misters. 70's / 80's music pumped in for effect. Staff is very friendly, cordial and fast. Food is good for bar food. I give it 4 stars for atmosphere.

gay Denny's gets 4 stars just for atmosphere, but as katie S. points out, the service is always atrocious. I'm sure staff is primarily prioritized by demographic, so service skill is secondary.

My favorite Greek restaurant in town. A true authentic Greek bar. The owner personally greets all patrons. She is wonderful. The bar is truly Mediterranean. Don't pass up the rotisseries. They all rock.

Hatch Chilies... just the thought of them, make my mouth water. No one, and I mean no one does hatch chilies like Arriba Mexican Grill. Every Sunday the haul out the fire roaster and roast chilies all day long. You can buy them $5 a pound. Now, on to the dishes... there are so many, I wont list them. My favorite is the Hatch Chicken Especial. It is just the right mixture of cheese, beef and hatch, served in a mini pyrex with rolled flour tortillas and your choice of rice and beans. Unlike Renee A., I like to go on Sundays because I bypass the seating line, and go straight to the bar. No kids, and a great brunch menu.

What can I say? I've been coming here for years for a reason... The food is fabulous. Lunch time buffet for $10 all you can eat. The best tandoori and mango losi you will ever have. The atmosphere is perfect. Indian TV is soooo cool. ;)  I'll be coming back again and again.

Cyprus grill is a wonderful addition to the Town n Country shopping area. Easy, tasty Greek food served well in a nice environment. Staff is friendly and skilled... they know their custom menu. I got the Gyro pita with Greek Fries... my fav. I have yet to order a bad thing from their menu.

I moved all the way up to 2 stars because of the outside patio, and in the desert, that's a necessity. The food is good for a chain. The margaritas are good, and cheap. Service is alright, but why do they have to be so stingy on the chips? Is it so expensive to have more than one bowl of chips? Fail.

I've been coming here for over 30 years. When I think of home, I think of Manuel's. Traditional Mexican cuisine, unbelievably friendly staff, and the worlds greatest bartender. I highly suggest you make this a regular spot.

Worst food I've ever had. 32nd Shea has some wonderful restaurants. Do yourself a favor and stay away. Used to be good, but the owner seems to have skimped on quality and service.

Wafflehouse is always a treat. Original style grill shop. If you haven't been because it looks low grade, well, it is, but on purpose. Order your custom hashbrowns, to go with your breakfast... Anytime!

Food was not worth the attitude. It made dinner very uncomfortable. The cuisine is unique, but poorly prepared. Again, service was horrible. The original Havana Cafe... off Camelback, is superior. Stay clear of THIS location.

I always feel like I am in a cafeteria when I'm at a Boston Market, but this one? It makes me feel like I'm in a cafeteria... a sanitarium cafeteria. The place was gross. Not sanitary. Food was old and gray. The place creeped me out. Big thumbs down

Pizza was amazing. Anti pasto to die for. This was my first time here, and it was packed. We waited 30 mins for a table, but it went fast. It is definitely a small cramped area, but a nice setting. The entire menu was very good. Not authentic italian cuisine, not not much is in the USA. I will most certainly go back.

In the middle of the desert, there is an oasis called The farm. rolling green grass, large pecan trees, and wonderful bars, restaurants, walking areas... very peaceful. The atmoshere is perfect, the food is divine, leading to a perfect experience. Weather you are from out of town, or from the valley, you cant die until you visit.

Unfortunately, The Gelato Spot loses a star just for it's old town Scottsdale location, but I was prepared to give them a solid 4 stars. As someone who lived in Sicily for years, I am pretty particular about my pizza, and gelato. I must say, the crust was amazing! The ingredients were authentic, and the gelato was top notch. Unfortunately, the service and decore left a lot to be desired. It seems ownership shot their wad on the prime location and wood burning stove, leaving nothing left for a quality staff. All staff members that night were high school girls, who had no concept of customer service. We were exposed to general complaints of having to work, why so and so can be late but they couldn't... on and on. Also, while preparing my gelato, a whole scoop was dropped into another flavors bin, which was quickly scooped up and put back into my container. gross. For authentic sicilian pizza, I give them 2 thumbs up. For all around experience, It was massively lacking. UPDATE: I was quickly contacted by the owner, who was very interested in my experience, and wanted my opinion on how to better his business. I respect the hell out of that. I am upping my rating to 4 stars. Thanks again!

The planing and execution of this stores existence is superior. I love having this store in my neighborhood. However, the management and allocation of staff is horrible. I've been now over a dozen times and not once have i received anything but incompetent service. The deli host 4 young and inexperienced staff, doing about a third of the output it should. Same with the checkout counters. Slow, mistakes, and completely unkind. It is frustrating, having such a great store but managed so poorly.

In my opinion, the best restaurant in Las Vegas. Every time I come here, I try something new, and it is always superior. I love the wine! Mia E., You are rally complaining that you didn't see enough acrobatics out of the wine angel? Wow... anywho, The wine tower is impressive, even without the flips. Don't go to Mandalay without making a reservation here!

Top notch. Menu is full of excellent options, and the wine... well, that's their specialty. A bit pricey for what I get, and the service has gone down hill over the years, but still a nice place to eat.

One of my regulars. I love the Vera Cruz shrimp. Service is good. Great atmosphere. They lose a star because only one tortillia comes with the meal. If you work downtown PHX and haven't tried this gem... you should.

I would have given 2 stars, but I feel betrayed by the horrible way one of my fav cuisines was handled. A philly cheesesteak is a form of chi, that no one should fuck with. Get it right or back off. Also, when you advertise a lemon coke as a dinner, make sure it's not coke with a lemon slice in it. That is false advertising.

I couldn't decide between a 3 star or 4... I error on the side of the establishment, and my possible bad mood and gave it 4. I cannot stand a mandatory 15 minute speech by the server or host about how awesome the place is, or how special the food is. It is pretentious and cocky. Just let me enjoy. And enjoy I did. The food was spectacular. All by myself I could have tasted the quality of the food. We did order espresso, which tasted like watered down coffee, but it was a Sunday, and I'm sure it was a skeleton crew. This place does get my recommendation, but it might have to be a Sunday for me to return. I dont want to be preached to again.

From the time we entered the door, until the time we left, the operators of this establishment treated us like on of the family. The atmosphere is homely and inviting. There seemed to be quite a bit of hookah smoking going on, which just added to the authentic environment. Unfortunately, we were there for carryout, but we will go back soon to enjoy a full sit down meal. We are looking forward to it.

My neighborhood actually has a top tier cafe! I'm very excited about this place. It has everything: Great decor, unique menu, hi-quality food and beverage, too-cool-for-school hipster staff. I really have enjoyed everything I have consumed there. Every Saturday morning I get an iced chai latte, large, DIRTY! (double espresso shot). It gets my day going. They don't get 5 stars, solely because the hipster attitude comes across rude sometimes. Not a major deal, but 5 stars equals perfection to me. Keep up the great work! FYI: 32 Shea has a liquor license, so their drink menu is just as awesome.

This is a very important 4 stars. My wife and I had a major incident while we were there, and I have complete justification to write a bad review. However, the management staff recognized the major impact of the issue, took care of everything quickly, for the 4 star recovery. On to the food... I always respect an Italian restaurant that gives aranchinis a try. These were very good for an American restaurant. Still on the look out for an authentic style one... The entire menu seems like a scientific slight american modification of traditional Italian dishes. They were well prepared, but left me wanting the real thing. We will return, for the quality of the food was exceptional.

Knew I was going to like this place the first time I came. It's the only restaurant I've been to where I'm depressed when I order... Knowing that I am missing out on everything else on the menu. Do not be afraid to take a doggie box home. The food is just as good the next day. Try the Duck Confit Fettuccine. About a dozen flavors hit your pallet in a swirl of ecstasy. The Truffled Deviled Eggs are amazing.
