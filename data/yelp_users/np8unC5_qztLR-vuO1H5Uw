I have takin all my cars for here over 10 years. I have had great service most of the time with a few hiccups over price. We have a friend who is a mechanic ( no longer in the field) who helps us trouble shoot and then we take the cars here for repairs.  I fortunately had a father who made me make small repairs on our cars when I was growing up, so tools and parts don't scare me. My car check engine light came on the code read 02 bank 1 sensor. I've replaced other sensors in my car.  Super easy. I replaced the part which is just a screw in and snap into place part. Took no time at all. However my engine light did not reset. I took the part back and replaced it with another heat sensor. No luck after driving a good 100 miles no reset.  So we take it to Fletcher's. They said they couldn't figure it out but they would call us. After a few more hours I get a call that they think we should replace the computer board for $1000. The car shows it running fine so that must be it. Something did not sit right with me. I told my husband that we should pick it up and take it to an emissions expert.  We got the keys from the front desk paid $90 for the test. Low and behold the engine light is off. We took it for our emissions test and it passes.  Later I looked up how to clear codes on your cars computer. Auto zone and repair shops have the ability to clear codes when testing to get an accurate read. Had I known that I would have figured that out myself. This almost cost me $1000 heck I'm mad I paid $90. Shady bananas.

My husband and i are adventerous eaters and wanted to try something new.  We were  first in the door at lunch and  quickly seated by a very nice male server whose name escapes me. He made recommendations for our meal as well as a great Indian beer.   Food was incredible. I only wish i had a larger stomach to try more. i'm definately going back  for the buffett.

This place always has good food and the bomb wings. I like the garlic or hot wings yum. We have gone here over the years but last went for a UFC fight. We got there around 530 and lucked out the Simone left the actual bar seating shortly after my husband and I got there. I ordered a tea figuring I had to pace myself because the main  bout would probably by closer to 9. My tea was around 3 bucks. I saw this after we got the bill and my dos Equis was 7 bucks each. Ouch. Just be warned. Don't know if that's the reg price now or special event pricing. It was fun and the food was good.

Great food. Love the Buffalo chicken salad. Happy hour specials are $3 for edimame and $3 for Queso and chips.Plenty of choices of beer to choose from. Fun atmosphere, wish they had video  poker or trivia for those of us that are not that into every sport.  That would make it a 5 star for me.

Amazing, amazing, amazing! We walked in first thing in the morning. The place was super clean and someone was singing in the back " were open, were open". I found that completely charming and welcoming. We were promptly greeted and our order was taken shortly thereafter. The chicken was great dont know what they did but it was moist and perfectly seasoned. The waffles had this nutty goodness. Portions were large.   I live in Mesa but have dreamed of it since. Need to make my way back there to try the catfish, oka and red velvet cake. Yummy for my tummy.

I had the unfortunate experience of having someone try to break into my business by throwing a large rock through a side window pane. Luckily we have an alarm, so nothing was taken. I called Garcia's glass and Mark came out that day gave me a quote and a next day repair time. I had a few quotes all very comparable. Based on his reviews I went with Mark. The work was lovely fast and fare and we were good as new. I even brought a window from home that had a crack in it which he repaired and gave me a good deal. This is what customer service should be like.

Love the bar. This is my local watering hole. Two minutes from my house. James and Renee know our drinks. They are seasoned and fast professionals. Always consistant. Great TVs everywhere, video poker by buzzfeed and good food.

I have been to this place before and have had an average experience here. Food is ok. Very Americanized flavors and since its a Buffett the food taste like it has been sitting.  However today on Christmas decided to give it a try again since no other place around was open. We walked in to a smell of different foods,old fish and something else. I just about turned around but my husband had his heart set. Got a few items sushi, crab was not cracked, prime tub was tough and you had to cut it yourself. However, once we got back to our table it smelled so bad. I tried to eat my food but the smell of sewer was so overwhelming  I just wanted to get out of there. The staff is nice and friendly, however there is an obvious issue with cleanliness. I will never return.

I'm a huge SF Giants fan. Since moving here  14 years ago, I have had to watch games in the east valley without my cheering section.  However we saw the SF signs one day while driving down Scottsdale Rd. I've seen this bar but never knew there was a place for my kind right here. Makes sense since the Giants Spring training park is a few minutes walk away. Most of the bars near by will show baseball but aren't really Giants bars.  This place is awesome I watch one of the World Series games here but was full of Giants fans. The food was amazing and the beer was cold.  I had the Devils Ale and a Moscow Mule. ( not so much for the tummy later ugh!) service was awesome. TV's everywhere and a super gigantic wall TV. Not bad spots.  So excited for spring training. This will be our spot.

These guys are honest and professional. We noticed a swarm on Sunday. Called for service and were told Bees many times will leave in 24 hours. The guy told us to call back the next afternoon if they were still there. i thought that was awesome since her could have just come out and killed and Bees and charged us.  The next day there were less bees but a 3 inch honeycomb starting on our second story. They came out in a few hours inspected the house to see if the bees got in the house. Sprayed knocked down the honeycomb and just charged us for a house inspection since it was such a small job.

The Bees are gone for good. The tech came out the very next morning. we had a swarm of Bees at my 2nd story roof line again. The tech was honest quoted me a very fair price. Super reasonable. Half what i paid a company last year. 1 month later and they are still gone.

Fun place. We went on a Wednesday.  I've never played golf before, however i quickly caught on. The service was prompt and the food was excellent. I just wish it was longer. Price is $25 before 6pm and $45 per hour after.  It did get pricey, we're competitive and had to play two games. We also ordered two appetizers, two flatbread pizzas and a steak quesadilla. A few beers and cocktails for four people. Our total was $250. Next time we will eat prior to playing so nothing interrupts our playing time.

Nice decor and atmosphere. Love the Latin music and unique menu. Tried the carnitas verde appetizer and guacamole, both were very flavorful and the chips were fresh and thick. Jalapeño margarita was so good they make their own jalapeño tequila.  Tip ask for the hot salsa if you like spice and flavor. It was so good. The first salsa brought it couldn't touch it.  Will be back for taco Tuesday.   We took home menudo. I must say most of the customers who are going to order menudo are going to be Mexican.  It can be an acquired taste. We were disappointed. Very little tripe, not very spicy but did have a cinnamon flavor. It's ok guys ramp up the spice on this one. Just like My abuelita.
