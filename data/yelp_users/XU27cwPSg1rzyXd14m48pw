i just learned that this is one of the largest parks in Phoenix.  there were a ton of options of hiking trails; decent parking, and bathrooms at the parking lot which was nice.  great vistas - gorgeous rock formations and desert lands made it a very picturesque hike.  really enjoyed it!

the front desk girls nearly made me turn away from this place.  no smiles.  looked bored and annoyed.  the place was nearly empty and they asked that we stand to the side while they find us a table.  seriously?!    but once we were seated the tone changed.  the waitstaff was really friendly and very knowledgeable.  we had fun using the ipad to look up a bottle of wine to share and enjoyed looking at the beautiful dining area.  we asked who the architect was and the waiter said he couldn't remember but he went and found out for us which was really cool.  we decided to get a bunch of small things instead of a meal.  the adult tater tots are amazing.  I suggest getting 2 orders.  the cheese is melty and amazing and the bacon flavor is strong and lovely.  the lobster rolls were a total disappointment.  the toasted bread was a waste and the lobster was small and uninteresting flavor.  the tuna tartare was a huge portion on a bed of avocado - I could have eaten the entire thing - insanely good!  and the rock shrimp were very good also.

what a really fun show!  It was really well paced and had a great selection of Beatles music.  The story line runs you through the decades.  The use of multi-media is really great and any seat in the house would be an incredible show.  it's a circular stage so there is stuff going on everywhere - it's hard to know where to look!!  I thought the Cirque stuff was a little less insane than some of their other shows.  don't get me wrong - stunning and fun to watch but it didn't seem as over the top/awe-inspiring as some of the others I have seen when it comes to the athleticism and "never before seen" type stuff.  But the show was packed with a great story, amazing costumes, graphics, dancing, etc., and I loved every minute of it!

I don't love this place.  I've gone a few times.  I feel that the service is mediocre - never very friendly or "on it".  the tables are way too close together - it's tough to get up, or even sit when people are int he tables right next to you.  the food and drinks are all quite good.  I've enjoyed everything I've ever gotten there, but the ambiance is so questionable that it overshadows the food.

Such a great experience!  Jessica is super nice and talkative.  She makes you immediately comfortable and talks you through the waxing process.  She did a great job and was very professional!

i wasn't very impressed with the menu for lunch.  everything seemed really heavy.  They did have a small menu of under 650/700 cal items but none sounded very good.  I asked about their "vegetable plate" which is actually just 4 of their side dishes...which is funny because the only vegetable on their side dish menu is corn or potatoes.  so I ended up getting their chicken salad which came with their signature croissant that was generously buttered and glistening.  The service was good and we were sat quickly.
