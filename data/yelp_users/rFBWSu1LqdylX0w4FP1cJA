Told me all I had to pay upfront was a $50 deposit, came home and found they had taken $200 out of my account. Called them to find out what was up, and they told me that I had prepaid for the gas in the car and agreed to some waiver. They did absolutely nothing about this but treated me like a liar when I said I hadn't been told any of that and I wouldn't have agreed to the waiver (their coverage of the car in case of an accident) had I known it would pull that much money from my account right away. I was in an accident and my car was being repaired, so money was already tight at that moment. I didn't appreciate the sneaky way they did this and then acted like I was just pretending that I wasn't told.

Called and made a reservation with this company via Groupon on Aug. 26th. Appointment set for September 14th at 8am. Company no-showed, office number goes to a full voicemail, no way of contacting them. I am requesting a full refund for the amount paid on this Groupon. I would like to resolve this on the company level, but since they are nowhere to be found, I have no way of doing that. In addition, they requested my debit card information before the move date, which I found unusual, and although they have not taken money out of my account yet, I have cancelled that card as a precaution. A review I found for this company quoted almost word-for-word my experience, with the difference that the customer in the review was able to contact the office and was told to "find someone else if you don't like it." Because of this company, my move is completely off schedule and I've had to pay a premium in order to get a last-minute mover. I am extremely unsatisfied and if I could leave a 0 star I would.
