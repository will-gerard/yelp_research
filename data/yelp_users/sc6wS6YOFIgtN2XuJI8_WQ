I never felt more like a waitress in the sky than I did on the Friday night flights from Phoenix to Las Vegas. Sheesh. A plane full of people wanting to start the party early. Guys buying drinks and asking us to give them to girls on the flight, people being loud, making plans on exactly what they're going to purchase with the million they're about to make on the slots.  The flights out of Vegas were different. People wondering why they'd gambled so much, newlyweds and the sleep deprived. The one constant was the alcohol. I don't think we denied people entry to the plane anywhere other than Las Vegas. I think people forget that one drink on the ground equals two in the sky (because your blood thins in the altitude). So if you're drunk already before boarding, you'll be super drunk during the flight.  If you do get kicked off a plane, luckily you're in McCarren. HUGE. It always struck me as funny to see people land here for the first time and be shocked to see slot machines in the airport. Yup. That and porn handed out to you as you walk out. Ah, Las Vegas.

I'm not a baseball fan. I don't dislike the sport, I just don't know it. My little boy, on the other hand, thinks he's the best sports player in the world -at any sport- and therefore loves baseball. He'd gotten a little Diamondbacks pocket schedule at a local pizza place and got excited that the Yankees (his T-ball team's namesake) was going to play right after his birthday. We offered and he chose tickets to D-Backs vs. Yankees in lieu of a party.  I went onto the website to look at the various pricing packages. After I fainted and came-to again from reading the pricing for the package with the pool, I called the stadium. I figured they'd be able to help me better with packages, pricing, discounts, etc. That wasn't the case. The guy was pretty unhelpful basically repeating what I had just told him. Most all the tickets were sold out, so all we could get were nosebleed seats (literally as it turned out. My son got a nosebleed towards the end of the game).  Again, not being baseball savvy, I appreciate that this stadium has like 10 million places to look around at and shop. You know who would be at the pool if price were not a factor? Me. You know who goes looking through all the various shops and appreciates all the choices? Me. Sorry if I'm making the experience less authentic.  It was very easy to find our seats even though we were wwaaaayyyyy up there. We were also able to see the game quite well. I know some people hate all the cutesy things they do like the songs and the cheering, but I (and I'm sure people that are like me) really like that stuff. The game would be sooooooo looooooong otherwise.  My son had a great time and that's what we were there for. It was his first time watching a major league game and the excitement showed on his face. I have to say that at one time a vendor passed by and someone in the row in front of us bought a cotton candy. They passed down the money and the vendor threw it at her. My son's eyes lit up and he told me to try to catch the next cotton candy the guy tossed out. Um, maybe we should take him more often.

I have two kiddies and they love this place. I however, am not as excited about it as they are. The food was so-so and still more expensive than I would've liked. There's all sorts of "kid traps". Light-up glasses and an entire gift shop full of more over-priced items. On the plus side, there's a mechanical crocodile just outside the restaurant. If your kid is young enough, you can always use that crocodile as collateral . . . . . "If you don't finish your food, that crocodile will get mad". "If you don't behave that crocodile is going to come over". You know, things like that which we may or may not have said to our son. - insert evil grin here-

I've tried to stay from reviewing America West because I worked here as a flight attendant. It's been years, though, and I'm still telling horror tales of my time here. I started here as a young, fresh-eyed girl that couldn't wait to travel and see new places. I left jaded and bitter more scared of flying than I had ever been before. I made lots of good friends and met lots of amazing people but everyone seemed unhappy with their job, pay, benefits, etc.  I'll summarize by telling you this. . . . We had a joke contest  going around coming up with new company slogans. Mine won. It was "America West. Where departure times are just a suggestion".

I went with friends who didn't believe me when I said that I don't eat sushi.  Everyone else wanted sushi and I couldn't argue. I ordered a combo which included a California Roll. Now, all my life I've considered myself a pretty smart person. I don't think of myself as an airhead, but I swear that at this place I told one of the workers "Excuse me, you forgot my bread", meaning my California Roll. I guess she thought I was playing but my friends had a good laugh.  After I took my foot out of my mouth, the food was pretty good. Even the non-bread roll.

So we were in Phoenix for the day and had a lot of plans. Thanks to all the places I've read up on here, I thought we'd have a full day of activities and lots of places to go to. I had plans to pop into IKEA for a little while and we ended up spending the bulk of our time there.   Here's the scenario . . .  1. we have a house that we've lived in for a few months 2. we have about a million plans for the house 3. we don't have a lot of left-over money to do it with  IKEA for us is a life saver. True, you won't buy any sort of heirloom furniture here. If you're looking for that, definitely go elsewhere. But if you want to have a stylishly decorated place, IKEA is a must. Even if you don't buy anything, you get a lot of ideas. I was practically drooling over all their organization choices. If you have them, bring the kids. There is a play area where you can check them into, but I have to tell you that my kiddies had a blast playing in the second floor. They were pretending that each "room" was theirs and having make-believe dinners, meetings and parties.  I also love that the restaurant charges less on account that people have to clear their own table. I'd like that to be the case everywhere else. I'd happily clear my (and everyone else's) table at other restaurants for a lower price. $.99 kids plate, $.50 coffee? Sign me up!  Overall, I LOVED it. My husband said he felt like sheeple for a while there, but I don't care. I'll take inexpensive, simple and stylish anytime. I also like the whole idea of paying for the plastic bags. I'm writing to the candidates convinced this should be some sort of law.   Yesterday . . .   my son: Can we go back to IKEA today? me: uh, no. my son: but I need to me: you NEED to? why?  my son: I want you to make meatballs but we don't have any flags for them me: oh. uh, some other day, ok? my son: ok, but we need them ok, that's what makes meatballs taste good.  me: (laughing) ok

Cleaning out the pantry only means one thing . . . a trip to IKEA! Oh, I drool over all their organization section. I dream of a tidy pantry with everything in its own container, stacked and labeled. I bought containers for cereal, flour, sugar, brown sugar, spaghetti, pasta (not long like spaghetti) and rice. Yes, my pantry looks amazing for not a lot of money. Thanks, IKEA.

I'd never been to IKEA without my kiddies. I now have to say that I just realized that I don't like my kids.  : P   Yes, I'm kidding. It was just soooo different without them. I didn't have to stop every two minutes and wait for them to be done playing house in each of the displays.  This time around,  I went for "a long desk" and more organization goodies. I have a loft with a pretty long wall, hence the long desk. I wanted it to be able to fit two people. I'd seen some elsewhere but for exceedingly high prices. Well, I found one here. . . . . for less than $100.  Now let me tell you about the legs. We were trying to choose the perfect legs for our desk for quite a while. They all seemed so short. 27 and 1/2 inches to be exact. We were measuring with chairs, pretending to sit down and whatnot. Now, I'd gone equipped with all the measurements I wanted, or that I thought I needed, I just never thought to measure how high my desk was. As it turns out, this is the standard size. Hmm, who would have thought. Once the desk part is on, it doesn't look so low. I thought I'd let you know and save you the embarrassment of having to tell an IKEA worker that all the desks there seemed like they were for little people (which I may or may not have done).  I also left there with several more "organization thingies" Think more containers for the pantry and things for mail. Yay! I am happy. Everything has a place and everything in its place.

This place is exactly what you'd expect . . . lots of kids, lots of noise and an alright buffet. We went on a Tuesday when they offer a one-time price of $18.99 per person but this includes the buffet and EVERYTHING in the place except for games that give out tickets or prices. It's a "for real" all day price too, not just the three hours. We got there at about noon and didn't leave until almost 9:00 PM.  For that price we did the laser tag (a few times), bumper cars (a few times), miniature golf, cosmic bowling, go-carts, video games, air hockey, lunch, dinner, dessert and the kids got on the rides like 75 million times. We paid $82 for our family of four which I think for all we got is a great deal anywhere.  Now, the buffet is not gourmet by any standards, but it's OK. There were several kinds of pizza and pastas, a couple of soups, a baked potato station, a salad bar, the standard soda fountain and several desserts. They also have different themed dining rooms, so we had lunch in the movie room, dessert in the club house and dinner in the sports room.  I suppose they also sell beer and wine. I didn't try any, but just be warned that if you're that dad that's trying to beat your tween at air hockey while playing with one hand and holding a glass of red wine in the other, you look like a giant DB.  Again, yes the place is loud, yes there are A LOT of kids, but they all seem to be having a blast, at least mine did. To see them have as much fun as they did, I'd gladly tolerate all that noise!

I am forever impressed when I first walk into any In-N-Out. The complete undeviating white and overall look of cleanliness is not lost on me. I've never seen an employee with a huge grease stain on their shirt or apron. All of them look super crisp and freshly pressed, shirts tucked in, black belts, girls with an oversized safety pin holding their apron closed. I couldn't tell you if any of the female employees there have long hair or not since they all have it neatly tucked into their caps. Ah. . . . I love walking into a clean looking place. I realize that a company that goes to those lengths to make sure of their employees appearance, must also be keen on quality.  I gladly ordered my double-double, fries and a coke. (yes, I can actually finish a double- double here. -blushing) You can taste the quality at first bite. Everything tastes fresh and natural. Delicious. No soggy, faded lettuce or frail tomatoes, just fresh, crunchy vegetables. Yummmm . . . then the fries . . . . those little golden sticks of heaven. They feel so airy light but tasty at the same time. My goodness. Just thinking about my meal makes me want to go again. I know I will. Soon.

Oh. My. God. Friends had been telling me that we should try Macayo's. They said it was good Mexican food. I finally tried it. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler and I'm not kidding, the sauce tasted like the crap they used to give us at elementary school and call enchiladas. That is EXACTLY what it reminded me of. Blech. I didn't like it then and I don't like it now. How have they been in business for so long?

Hi. My name is Yvett and I'm a Sanrio-holic. Hello Kitty is my weakness. It all started back when I was about four years old. A family friend gave me a Hello Kitty piggy bank for my birthday and the whole obsession started there. I love, love, love all things Hello Kitty. As a result, I've sort of forced this upon my daughter as well. If I could've had this Hello Kitty wedding, I would have. . .   http://www.planethellokitty.com/hello-kitty-wedding  I could seriously spend a fortune at the Sanrio store if I had one to spend. Given the choice between a meal and something from Sanrio, Hello Kitty always wins. Always. I'd like to divulge further into this obsession of mine, but like all good addicts, I want to keep it as private as I can.
