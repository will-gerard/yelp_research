We have been taking our dog to Dr Connie Anderson for over a year now and I have to say, she is one of the best vets we have seen.  Can't recommend her practice enough?  Very caring and compassionate and isn't all about making money.  Just a thought to the gentleman below.  I would voice your concern with the clinic about the hours and I am sure they would be happy to fix this issue...instead of you giving a 2 star review.

Was very excited to try out this restaurant for their gluten free options.  My husband and I arrived at the restaurant around 5:15 pm.  I ordered their grilled chicken breast dinner with seasonal vegetables and roasted potatoes and my husband ordered the non gluten free French toast.  I was a bit shocked when my dish was brought to the table and on my plate were frozen vegetables that consisted of corn, carrots and peas. The chicken was very large and didn't taste bad, but was far from exciting.  The roasted potatoes where cut like French fries and were undercooked and tasteless. I don't know if we just came in on an off night, but I am not sure I will be back.I paid $11.95 for a meal I could have cooked at home.  My husbands French toast was nothing special either.  Very sad, as I thought I had possibly found a place that I could get gluten free options.  I did order a piece of their gluten free cheesecake and it was absolutely delicious, so the meal was not totally a flop.

Being gluten free it's hard to find a really good breakfast place. Well this place, hands down is the best gluten free breakfast I have ever eaten. Service was quick and friendly. Portion size is hefty as well. I ordered the waffle with strawberries, my husband ordered the French toast and my daughter had the kids breakfast. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food. Prices were also reasonable considering the portion size. Would definitely eat here again!

Well was excited to try out a new pizza place that offers gluten free pizza, but my enthusiasm quickly went out the door when I took my first bite. The only description I can give the pizza is "Frozen Pizza from the grocery store. It really was pretty bad and expensive for the lack of taste it left in my mouth. The only thing I had to be thankful for was that I had a Groupon, so didn't have to pay full price for it. My daughter did order the kids macaroni and cheese and did say it was good. Needless to say we won't be returning for pizza. My husband ordered a regular pizza and he was not impressed either.
