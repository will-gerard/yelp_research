We had a great experience here.  If you find yourself in the unfortunate position where  you need an auto body shop after a collision, I highly recommend Andy's!  We have used them twice (don't judge), and each time have appreciated the time they took to thoroughly explain the problems and what our vehicles would need, including costs of parts and labor.  They made getting and returning a rental car simple.  They're very kind and respectful, and do a great job at what they do - both of our vehicles came out looking as "good as new."

My experience was the same as Karen A.'s. I bought two vouchers through a coupon service, but then was convinced to buy their "deep clean" package (outside of those vouchers - meaning, I still have two left).  It apparently included cleaning the baseboards, oven, microwave, fans, etc.  Basically, they did not even wipe down the counter tops (and especially not behind/under any small appliances or fruit bowl) or bathroom mirrors - much less take out the trashes, make a bed....  I confronted the manager/leader figure about 3 different areas (which I never thought I would do), before I gave up and just wanted them to leave so I could finish the job, and each time, I was told something to the effect of "yeah, yeah, we used a special product on that."  So special, I guess, that it leaves coffee grounds behind on the counter top, from the morning.  It was a huge sink, and I would never call them back - EXCEPT for the fact that I have two vouchers left, and would love for someone other than me/us to clean the house.... I called a few times leaving messages over the course of a week or two, and finally got in touch with someone.  I scheduled a service for a morning a couple of weeks ago, and not only did they not arrive or call that day, but I have not been able to reach them at their phone numbers or gotten a call back in the interim.  Amazing.  I strongly recommend you not support them.

I had the great pleasure of stopping in at Local Jonny's, for my first time, yesterday - [us] dirty and smelly from a fun all day hike in the heat. Starving, but not wanting to "spoil our appetites" for dinnertime around the corner, my mom and I settled on "The 'Burger'" to share (read: to stuff our faces with). It's vegetarian (which suits me well!); made in-house, the black bean patty comes with a chipotle aioli sauce, lettuce, tomato, and I think even feta and avocado, on a ciabatta bun ($9). A nice light salad and a little chocolate chip cookie came on the side of a cute presentation with a steel pizza pan, covered in parchment(-type) paper. It was really delicious. I've made and eaten my share of veggie burgers (served scratch-made three kinds on a food business I had years back), and really loved this one. There was something tangy, with a nice spice, which offered a bright flavor in and around the patty. The ciabatta seemed fresh and nice and chewy, and worked well with the rest of it (not too big or too bready to dominate). I even liked the dressing on the salad (and usually am super picky about any dressing with, but especially on, a salad) - it was a sweet and a little sour... something (maybe a kind of honey mustard?). The plate was clean in moments, letting us enjoy the drinks we ordered and the great setting. Jon made a great recommendation to my wine-drinking mom who was craving a beer after hours on the trail - she was very happy with the SanTan SunSpot. I had a decaf Americano w/ soy that was really tasty - ordering Americanos can be risky, as they often come overly diluted and lose the flavor of the coffee; asking for a milk to be added can mean you get milk with a bit of coffee, or some kind of curdled mess (for nondairy milks...). This was great strong coffee flavor (which, if you have to drink decaf, you often have to settle for medium- or light-bodied flavors, which is less fun), nice complement with a bit of the milk, and even the offer to remake if not to my liking. We interacted with four staff members, all of whom were beyond pleasant, making the experience warm, as comfy as your own dinner party might be, and totally appealing all around. Looking forward to trying Local Jonny's again soon for other lunch, and definitely breakfast or dinner items - I hear the live music acts are great, too!

It was the grand opening - first day - meaning that all businesses should be given a huge pass for most things and a big handshake just for having made it to this point.  I'll share our experience with you, and you can imagine it may be different when you check them out.  I was thrilled to have a new restaurant claiming "healthy" and vegetarian options right in our neighborhood.  We went around 1pm for lunch.  One of the two chocolate chip and hemp cookies was really tasty that we tried bites of while our meals arrived - they have a case of sweets that are either made there or by the local Polish bakery, I overheard said.  We splurged and ordered three dishes (each about $10), including their "special of the day," the blueberry hemp waffle.  It was well-cooked, but otherwise not detectably different from a regular blueberry waffle.  Typical Country Time type syrup accompanied it and a cinnamon-y compound butter.  The breakfast burrito came next; the order was to have eggs, vegetarian chorizo, gouda, tomatoes, avocados, and onions, with salsa.  No chorizo (sadly), no flavor to the eggs (which may have been relying on the chorizo accompaniment), one tiny sliver of brown avocado at the bottom, and a cold spinach tortilla wrapped around it.  Salsa was reminiscent of frozen tomatoes blended up with some dried parsley.  Then, we got the veggie burger.  We asked if it was house-made and were told it was, and you could add whatever fixin's on top, including choice of bun - sounded great!  It came on a white bun similar to an Aunt Hatty's or whatever, with a sprinkling of shredded iceberg, tomato slices, red onions in a ramekin on the side (huh?), scant avocado, and a very-clearly-packaged patty (it was fine - pretty sure I've had that one from Costco - but not particularly delicious, and not cooked for any texture on the outsides).  My husband's a big fan of sweet potato chips; the ones on the side of the burrito and burger were what he called "bottom of the bag" = a pile of crumbs with a little handful of those veggie straw things on top.  My husband - not unaccustomed to the indulgent all-American meal which you'd think would elicit a response like this one - said his stomach felt kind of terrible a little while after the lunch.  Nothing was spoiled, of course, but we were not left with a light healthful feeling, at the very least, afterwards.  (Note that we did not finish the haul we ordered, as readers might reasonably expect it was the quantity we consumed....)  We ordered five things, thinking we were getting a good sample of our friendly new neighborhood joint's vittles; perhaps their caf√©'s specialty or comfort zone is in the drinks - they have an array of great-sounding juices and smoothies.  I wish them good luck, either way.
