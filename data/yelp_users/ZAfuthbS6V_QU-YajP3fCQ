Awesome Bed Bath and Beyond! We returned a $300 plus juicer and  had zero hassle, no questions, no drama, just simply the best customer service experience. We will continue to make this BB&B our go to shop in the Valley!

This Safeway always has vagrants out front. Very sketchy and somewhat dangerous. My wife and I were threatened with a knife while waking to our car in the parking lot. I would advise anyone and everyone to avoid this Safeway at all cost.

Called and needed windows cleaned on short notice. KC & Co, were on site in less than 24 hours.   If you appreciate solid communication, being on time, professionalism, attention to detail and fair pricing, then you have your window cleaning company right here.   I highly recommend.   Bravo Zulu!

My watering hole. Upscale sports bar or as they call it "The Garage." I dig this spot, I think you will too. Super clean, very nice staff, laid back, really just a solid place for drinks, grub and to catch a game or live music on Saturday nights....Cheers!
