Make sure not to zone out while you're driving to the Welcome Diner or you'll zip right past it (as my friend and I did).  It's right on the corner of 10th Street & Roosevelt in a cute little red and white dining car.  There are a few parking spaces behind the diner on 10th Street.  I would check the hours, as I think I was told differently than the hours posted in the other review.  My friend and I went to the diner on a Saturday afternoon and were able to get seats inside at the tiny counter.  I'm sure as it gets warmer, those will be harder to come by and that when the weather is nice, most people sit outside.  It is indeed a tiny space on the inside and half the seats have a direct view into the kitchen area, which is kind of homey.  I'm pretty small, so the size inside wasn't an issue for me, but claustrophobes and bigger people might feel squished.  I ordered a hamburger and fries and my friend got an egg sandwich.  The burger was pretty good, but relatively small in comparison to what's generally served at restaurants.  If you're really hungry or a big eater, you'll probably want to go for the double burger.  The fries were good - nice and crisp.  My friend was pretty happy with her egg sandwich but unhappy with her cup of water, which was apparently pretty bad even for tap water.  They have a bunch of organic sodas, along with Coke and Diet Coke, if you're like me and can't wash down a burger and fries with anything but a carbonated beverage.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty cool place and will definitely return with more friends in tow.  (Possibly for one of their movie nights...movies + tasty food = a good time).  Bonus points for their helping with the downtown rejuvenation while also supporting local businesses (Schreiner's, Mary Coyle's).

Hooray for the reopening of China Chili!  The new location seems to be much larger than the old one and has way more parking (two lots!).  The decor of the giant dining room is still pretty plain and the music was an odd selection varying between traditional Asian music and Kenny G.    Ambiance aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my favorite dish, Sweet and Sour Chicken.  It was a radiant shade of orange and simply delicious, as always.  I especially appreciate the fact that they give you a larger portion of your dish than of white rice, a proportion skewed at some other Asian restaurants.  I could have gone for a knife to cut up the giant pieces of chicken that make up the dish, but I powered through.   I'm generally pretty picky about my Chinese food, but China Chili hasn't yet let me down.

Karsh's is a transplanted New Yorker's baked good heaven.  Bagels, rugulach, black and white cookies - all delicious.  I spent a high school summer toiling away in one of the neighboring stores and gained at least five pounds due to my daily dessert of a giant fudge brownie.    The best thing about Karsh's though is their chocolate seven-layer cake.  It is the cake of choice for almost every family gathering we have.  Not only is the yellow cake just the right amount of sponginess, but the chocolate frosting is probably the best I've ever had.  I could eat this cake for every meal of the day, and may actually have done so on at least one occasion.  Mmmm...cake.

Coming back from NYC a pizza snob, this place holds its own with me.  They say their secret is using NYC water (or at least water that's Ph balanced to match that of NYC; it's not coming in via tanker).  Whatever it is, I like it and I've got some other NYers to back me up.  Also high on the list are the garlic and cheesy knots.  My only complaints are that they serve Pepsi instead of Coke and that the ziti sauce can be a bit peppery sometimes.

Best mechanics ever.  I brought them a list of repairs that my dealership gave me (equal to the total value of my car) and they told me which ones were imperative and which ones were optional.  They basically turned away excessive amounts of my money.  I almost hesitate to write this review, as they're already pretty busy and I want to have them all to myself.

I am normally not a fan of reviews of uber-chains like this (does the quality of McNuggets really vary from McDonald's to McDonald's?) but I feel the need to highlight this place because a) the pickins are slim for reviews of stuff on the west side outside the Westgate or Arrowhead areas; b) I'm not really reviewing the quality of the food; and c) it must be noted that Sonic is open until midnight (also rare for this area, apparently).  After a late dinner the BF and I headed back across town to his neighborhood.  Around 11pm I started craving ice cream.  After a few internet searches I found that most dessert places in this area were long closed.  Not feeling like resorting to the McDonald's soft serve (have I really just dropped their name twice in one review?) I kept searching.  Finally, I found Sonic and checked to make sure they were still open (tick tock, it's now 11:32pm).  Joy!  They are open until the clock strikes twelve AND they have a decent selection of desserts.    Cut to the drive-thru where I order their version of a Blizzard (switching up the fast food references) that can even be chocolate-flavored.  Hooray!  My night has been saved!  I return home, scarf down some tasty chocolate ice cream goodness and then fall asleep on the couch watching "Bad Boys."  What more could a girl ask for?

Alta Vista saved my puppy from the dreaded Parvo.  This feat alone is a great endorsement for them, but there's so much more.  The staff is always really nice and friendly to both people and pets.  In addition to being a veterinary hospital, they also do grooming and boarding.  All this and their amazing extended hours, make it hard to justify taking my dog anywhere else.

So.  Many.  TVs.  If you want to watch a game (or many games all at once), this is the place.  Alas, my review will solely be for the ambience at this point, as I was too engrossed in the nail-biter of a game to eat more than a few pieces of broccoli from the vegetable tray.  I recently visited Santisi Brothers to catch the U of A vs. Washington basketball game (Go Cats!) and was simply amazed by the number of flashing screens upon walking in.  A row of large flatscreens run along the walls with smaller screens above them.  When they switched all the big screens to the U of A game, it was magical.  My friend and I were happy to find some other Wildcats (tough to come by in ASU/enemy territory) to form our own mini-McKale.  Something that I noticed that is extremely important for ideal television viewing in this scenario is the layout of the tables.  They have regular-height tables along the walls, with bar tops and stools set behind them.  This creates almost a stadium-style set up for viewing the screens.  Maybe not important for everyone, but if you're 5'3" and accustomed to hopping up and down or peering through armpits to get a glimpse of the action in front, you'll appreciate the thought put into this.  Service was pretty good.  We were there through the shift change and both waitresses made sure to periodically check in to make sure things were okay.  (And possibly to see if we'd like to order some freaking food already.  Sorry ladies, it was late in the afternoon and I wasn't about to gorge myself on bar food before a tasty dinner with the in-laws.  Maybe next time.)  The ladies room was pretty clean but had one of the shortest toilets I've seen in a long time.  Goodness, it was like it was child-sized it was so low to the ground.  Glad I'm not so old and broken down that I needed help getting back up.  If you are a newbie, as I was, you may have some difficulty finding the place at first.  It's located in a giant strip center on the northwest corner of I-17 and Bell.  Once upon a time, the center used to be pretty full.  Now it's kind of a ghost town with Hooters and Native New Yorker along Bell and the dollar  theaters and Santisi as the big names set in the back.  Sometimes they have a Halloween store too.  Do not let the blight deter you though.  Power through the empty parking lots and enjoy the flickering goodness of a plethora of televisions.

After hearing a lot of buzz about this restaurant, I finally got the chance to check it out.  I had attempted to go a few weeks earlier, but the hour wait for a table was a little too much for my already-growling stomach to handle.  This time we called in a reservation, which made our wait pretty non-existent.   First thing to note was that the place was very busy and pretty noisy.  Not as noisy as Delux, but soft-spoken people are going to have to take it up a notch.  Luckily, my party was comprised of pretty loud people, so we were okay.  When things did periodically quiet down, there was a pretty cool selection of music playing ranging from Iron and Wine to Simon and Garfunkel.   We were seated at a table in the center of the dining room that had two chairs on one side and a bench seat on the other.  Being relatively short, a couple of us found a bit of a challenge sitting in the bench, which is a little lower than at some other places.  It wasn't horrible, but we definitely had to sport excellent posture all night.   To start the meal, we ordered the Chicken Nachitos.  The portion was not giant, like you see at many other restaurants, but a good size for all five of us to split and still keep our appetites.  We ordered a couple of burgers, a prime rib and the crab cakes.  The burgers were delicious, possibly even better than those at Delux (gasp!).  The review of the prime rib was good as well.  The crab cakes, which were a special that night, went over well, although for two crab cakes and an ear of corn, the price of $30 seemed a little hefty.  For dessert we ordered the Turtle Sundae.  It was your average sundea but with the hot fudge and sprinkles on the side, so you can be as conservative or crazy with them as you'd like.   Overall, I enjoyed the place.  Cute place, good food, nice atmosphere.    That being said, I do have one complaint in regards to their beverages.  Soda is served by the can with a glass of ice, something that is the norm in places like NYC and Europe.  That's fine, you don't want the hassle of dealing with a fountain.  I'll deal.  I will say that it is pretty annoying when combating the desert heat of Phoenix.  Charging $2 for a can of soda that probably costs less than a tenth of that when bought in bulk just seems like highway robbery.  Phoenix has always been the land of free refills, proabably because it's really hot here and people need to drink a lot of fluids to survive.  It's not just the soda that they're stingy with though.  A few members of the party ordered iced teas and lemonades, which came already poured in large glasses with ice.  That setup seems made for free refills, but they too were charged for each glass.  Additionally, there were times when our server or another staff member came up to the table and refilled the glasses without even being asked, helping us to rack up a non-alcoholic drink bill equal to the prime rib.  C'mon.  It's hot here.  Really hot.  People drink a lot of liquid.  Why be so stingy with the beverages?

This place is super cute and the employees are pretty friendly.  The vibe is laidback and neighborhoody, making you want to hang out there forever.  They make an excellent Iced Chai Tea Latte and the giant cupcake that I had was delicious as well.  I only wish I lived within walking distance of Copper Star so that I wouldn't have to worry about parking, which can be a bit tricky at times.  Definitely check out the cool bathrooms (I'm guessing the men's is as nice as the women's) before you leave.

The Roosevelt Tavern is a great example of how cool downtown Phoenix can be.  Matt Poole has done an awesome job making this a cool, relaxed place to hang out and have a beer with friends.    The decoration inside has a modern homey vibe to it with clean lines and lots of candles to dance light across the rooms.  They did a great job restoring the old Craftsman (I think) house.  It feels kind of like you're at a private house party, it's so cozy.    I partook in a lovely Hefeweizen that I actually enjoyed, despite my not being a huge beer person.  I had forgotten to leave room for food, but the guy next to me at the bar had what looked to be a delicious sandwich.    Drinking is currently regulated to inside the establishment only, as we learned from the kind police officer sitting on the front porch.  He did tell us that a permit to serve on the patio was in the works though, so keep an eye out for that.  Something to keep in mind: 3rd Street is a ONE WAY street.  This is good to know, as you'll be parking on the street and this gives you two sides to choose from.  However, if you accidentally overshoot the place, don't do as my friend did and try to make a u-turn.  Yikes.

Bison Witches Tempe definitely has a different ambiance than the Tucson original (a tiny older building where they eventually punched through the wall to overtake the space next door), but the food is still great.  I've been waiting for years for BW to make it up here.  I used to spend entire summers awaiting my first visit upon the return to school.  I think that the bread that they use at the Tempe store may be a little subpar to that of the Tucson bread, but it doesn't affect the taste enough that I don't go there whenever I get the chance.  The house honey mustard is fantastic and may even help clear out your sinuses a bit too.  And, If you're really broke, you can get the half-sandwich meal with chips for $4 and it's decently filling.

Despite my initial hesitation at trying one of their sandwiches (they have one that is made withSun-Dried Tomato peanut butter, bacon bits, lettuce AND cream cheese) I caved and checked it out.    It's a cute little place.  They give you animal crackers with every sandwich and the first drink they list on the menu is milk.  Awww.  It just fits right in with all the little kid stores in that area of the mall.  Makes me almost forget the image of peanut butter and bacon bits.  I did find a sandwich that I could get behind though, the LATTE DA.  It's made with European Caf Mocha peanut butter, pretzels twists and marshmallow spread.  Delicious.  My sister says that it shouldn't count as a meal, that it's more of a dessert, what with the marshmallow and all.  Whatever.  I'm an adult and I'm eating marshmallows and peanut butter for lunch if I want to.  So there.

This is my favorite supermarket.  It's nice without being too snooty (ahem, AJ's) and their Musak selection is usually pretty good.  This past weekend I heard Guns 'N Roses "Patience" while I was perusing the Lean Cusines.  How cool is that?

The Esplanade is a decent movie theater to go to.  We are currently in a bit of a fight though, as they've decided to stop selling Snickers Popables.  It might not be entirely their fault, maybe more of a corporate decision, but I think I'm going to start sneaking my own treats in after that slap in the face.  Besides disagreeing as to acceptable movie snacks (they replaced the Popables with Goldfish crackers), I'll usually choose this theater over others, if only for it's proximity to my house and the mostly civilized crowd.  I find less screaming babies in R-rated movies at this theater than at, say, AMC Arizona Center.  Sometimes you get some annoying, giggly teens and pre-teens, which is why post-city-mandated-curfew shows are great.  I never have figured out why they can't seem to solve the problem of the garbage odor though.  It's not always present, but when it is, it's there in full force.  I'm guessing it's the food garbage from the restaurants, but I can't think that their neighbor, the Ritz-Carlton, is a big fan of that stink wafting over.  Some tips:  * If you want to avoid parking lines, park underground.  (This may only be useful after business hours and on weekends.)  If you come in off 24th Street, the entrance to the underground parking is to the right.  It's kind of creepy, but you can usually park right by the elevators and avoid the reeeeeally long lines that occur when almost all 14 theaters let out at the same time.  * If you're afraid to park underground, simply go downstairs and get an ice cream/coffee/pastry/drink at one of the restaurants and bars on the ground level.  By the time you get your food or drink and get back to your car, you've most likely avoided the line.  Don't be too leisurely though, or you'll catch the next exodus and the circle will start all over again.  * If you take the stairs, make sure you make note of which side of the stairs you came up.  There are two sets on each side of the theater and if you go down the wrong side, the entrance to your floor will be a non-descript little door rather than the wide open double-doored entrance that you recognize.

I want to like this place, I really do.  I mean, I like cookies.  I might even love them.  And it's located right in Central Phoenix.  AND everything's organic.  Why, you ask, don't I like this place then?  Because it's NEVER open.  Seriously.  I tried to go on a weekend.  Oops!  Monday through Friday only.  Then I battle traffic and scoot over after work  with the idea of taking some tasty cookies home for dessert.  Just kidding again!  They closed at 5:30pm.  Tell me, when is a regular ol' office worker supposed to buy some friggin' cookies?  Am I supposed to order them online and then have them shipped to me?  Last time I checked green consumers were supposed to shop locally and avoid having stuff shipped because of the packaging and gas wasted by the little mail trucks and stuff.  Sorry if I'm cranky, but I'm a little irritable when I don't get my dessert.

As I stood in line at Royal Coffee I saw a chocolate chip Urban Cookie staring up at me from the counter.  "Eat me," it said.  As I had been wanting to try Urban Cookies since back when I wrote my snippy review, I needn't be told twice.  I seized the opportunity to sample their goods without battling to get to their retail store.  O.M.G.  So delicious.  I gobbled that cookie down like I hadn't eaten in years.  Freaking amazing.  Urban Cookies, I did not doubt that you would be amazing when we finally met, and you lived up to my expectations and then some.    After my cookie enlightenment, I checked their website to see if I was still to be tormented by their unattainable hours of operation.  No!  They are now open on Saturdays.  I am squealing with delight (on the inside, as I am at work and squealing is not so professional).  Now the only thing standing in my way is the trek across the 17 and maybe a little bit of that pesky willpower that will tell me eating cookies for three meals a day is not a good idea.

I was so excited when I first heard they were building this dog park.  Sadly, I think they could have done better.  It looks pretty cool and has all sorts of hills for the dogs to run up and down and there's usually a good mix of dogs there.  My complaint is that the ground covering is rocks.  After tearing around chasing other dogs, my poor dog usually starts to look uncomfortable and picks up her feet a lot.  At the other parks, she'll usually sit down and relax a bit, but she's not so fond of doing that here in the deserty landscaping.  I'm totally a fan of xeriscaping and water conservation, but if you didn't wear shoes, would you want to run around on sharp rocks?

This review is based solely on my attempted visit to the Q Lounge for a friend's celebration.  My friend's going-away party was thrown at Bobby Q's and then the celebration moved next door to the Q Lounge.  Seeing as how I am not a high school teacher like most of the invitees, I did not arrive until the latter part of the celebration.  Being unfamiliar with the establishment, I walked in through the Bobby Q's entrance.  The hostess was very polite and pointed me in the direction of the Lounge.  I thanked her and turned in the direction she had instructed me only to run into (almost literally) the Q Lounge bouncer, a large brickwall of a man.  QLB: "Where do you think you're going?" Me: "In there." QLB: "I don't think so. You need to go outside and go around through the back."  Apparently the entrance is in the back of the building but I was stunned by the nasty attitude I received.  It's really the kind of douchebaggery I would expect in Scottsdale, not a place located on the west side of the I-17.  While it may seem like a trivial encounter, it was the sheer disgust in the tone of the QLB's voice that really made it bad.  We walked around the back and went into the club for the end of the party.  Inside was nice enough, but it still didn't get rid of the bad impression.  Upon telling this story to others, it turned out that many other people had bad experiences with the place.  Anything ranging from general ghetto-ness to actual physical fights.  So, basically, I won't be heading back here ever again.  If I want snotty attitude, I'll go to Scottsdale.

Some girls from my office recently trekked over to Hilton Village to get us some of these cupcakes for an office birthday celebration.  Wow.    Admittedly, the novelty of cupcakes is lost on me, having done time in the Big Apple where this trend seems to have started up a few years back.  I will say that I was quite happy with the offerings from Cupcakes though.    First of all, they are adorable to look at.  The frosting is piled high and makes it look like a cartoon cupcake.  It's almost hard to eat them, they're so cute.  Not eating a cupcake is unimaginable to me though, so my review won't stop here.    After getting over the cupcakes' beauty, I dug in.  The frosting has a light, airy texture to it but still manages to be sweet enough for a sugar fiend like myself.  The cake portion was tasty too, and they offer a variety of recipes beyond the standard chocolate and vanilla.  That being said, of the ones that I tried, my favorite one was the Tuxedo, which is described as "chocolate cake with a creamy vanilla frosting that is topped with chocolate sprinkles."  Mmmm.  They have a regular menu and daily specials which sound tempting enough that I might have to go over there regularly to sample all of these offerings.  Cupcakes also offers a decorate-it-yourself cupcake for kids and a cupcake for dogs.  What with the onslaught of cupcake places opening it's going to be tough to choose which one to go to feed your habit.  I say, check out Cupcakes for both cute and tasty factors.  Plus, their motto is "You can have your cupcake and eat it too."  How can you go wrong with that philosophy?

My brief stint in NYC has given me a bit of the snobbies when it comes to Chinese food.  Now, I'm not adventurous and I can't handle too much spiciness, but I feel as though I'm a pretty good judge of fried rice and some of the basic dishes that no one but me get excited about.  China Chan delivers in both of these areas.  This place started as a fantastic Yelp find and served as a lunchtime hideout for my coworkers and me.  Super cheap and filling lunch specials served by the perky proprietor were our salvation from a crappy workplace.  Since escaping said hellish work environment, I've returned to CC for many a delicious dinner.  They do have delivery, but I've missed the delivery driver's departure a few times so I generally just pick it up myself.  It's pretty sparse on the inside, which is fine when it's daylight and you can look out the windows, but does not make for the best dinner dining room.  If you work in the neighborhood, make sure to stop by for a lunch that won't break the budget and might even send you home with some leftovers.  Now that we're not hiding out there at lunch, we'll open up our space to anyone else who needs some midday goodness.

Finally!  A nice, clean nail salon where I don't have to worry about a staph infection or have flashbacks to the Seinfeld episode about Elaine's nail salon experience.  Honestly, I never get my nails done and I only get pedicures every once in a while since I haven't really found anywhere that's affordable and nice enough for me to patronize regularly.  I may just have to make a bit of a lifestyle change now that I've found this place though.     The space is super cute without being too girly.  My sister spotted the Ruffle Frame Shelf from the Brocade Home catalog when we first looked in the window.  It's light and airy but elegant too.  Instead of pedicure chairs, there's a long cushiony bench that stretches along the wall and individual sinks.  It has throw pillows that you can use to make yourself super comfortable.  The manicures are done at a long, tall bar with fresh flowers set up at each station.  Both the pedicure and manicure stations face a large flatscreen TV that was playing an old movie when I was there.  If you don't want to watch the movie, the music selection was pretty good too.  A bit of Norah Jones, some Jenny Lewis, some Radiohead. There's also a little table at each pedicure station where you can keep your magazine or a drink.   Since they just opened a week ago, they're offering some pretty sweet deals.  All services are half off except the package deals.  Even without the 50% off, the prices are pretty reasonable.  You can get a quick manicure or pedicure (no exfoliation) for $16 and $26 respectively.  And so as not to leave out the men who like to have nice nails, they offer a MAN-cure ($15) or pedicure ($25) with the option of a buff or matte polish.   I opted for the Island Indulgence pedicure that included a coconut milk bath and cane sugar scrub.  It smelled so nice that it took everything I had in me not to periodically contort myself in my work chair to sniff my calves.  Now that's a good endorsement, no?

This store has just gone through a fantastic remodel.  The interior used to be pretty bland with rows of shoes displayed on top of cardboard boxes; very much going with the warehouse vibe.  The newly remodeled store goes for more of a boutique look.  The walls now have an exposed brick look to them, the industrial ceilings are black with a large chandelier hanging in the entry.  The clearance racks are now hidden behind curtains at the back of the store.  Maybe it's the softer lighting, but it even seems like the shoe selection is a bit hipper.    The men's section looks like it might be smaller, but the missing shoe selection has been replaced by a seating area and flat-screen TV tuned to sports.  Call me crazy, but me thinks this may be a welcome change for some male patrons whose female companions plan on combing through aisle after aisle of cute shoes.  I don't know if it has anything to do with the remodel, maybe they moved out a lot of stock to make way for the hipness, but they were kind of lacking in their boot selection.  I feel like the place still had knee-high boots last summer, so it's kind of weird that they'd have such a minimal selection when it's still stinkin' cold outside.

Same tasty food, but SO much less pretentious than the Arcadia Pita Jungle.  This location seems to be staffed by happy, young hipsters that do not ooze judgement when you order a dish containing meat or when they see you roll up in anything but a Prius.  Even at this welcoming location, there are still some things that make things less-than-perfect.  I love Pita Jungle's hummus but always have to order extra pita to go with it (really, just one measly piece?).  I'm guessing that's the case for most people, unless they're eating the remaining hummus with a spoon.  Why so stingy?  After all, "pita" is in your name, shouldn't it be a'plenty?  Another thing that vexes me is that they haven't jumped on the glass bottle, cane sugar soda train.  If they have a fountain, there must be call for soda in general, so why not align it with the rest of your menu and make it a little more natural (or as natural as soda can get)?

It had long been a dream of The Rob to open his very open Cheba Hut near GCC.  When we recently found out that someone had beaten him to it, he was a bit sad but also excited for the now close proximity of his favorite herbal-themed eatery.  This location is located in a strip mall along with a Circle K, tattoo parlor and Trails.  (If you're familiar with the area, Trails took over the large space once occupied by the nudie bar and Cheba Hut took over the old Trails space.)  Whether you're a big ol' stoner or a sober square like myself you'll enjoy the tasty sandwiches with funny names.  We even took The Rob's parents for a visit so that his conservative, vegetarian mom and his formerly-tie-die-wearing dad could enjoy the goodness, which they most certainly did.  Only complaints:  1) Pepsi products instead of Coke 2) As stated before, the toasting does take a little while, so you have to wait a little bit for them to bring your sandwich to the topping bar. 3) Lacking in chip selection.  I mean, c'mon, you run an establishment themed around the chronic and you don't offer BAKED chips?

Since visiting Hawaii this past spring, I've been intrigued by all things Hawaiian off the island.  (Aloha Spirit!)  So when I heard this place had opened in Central Phoenix, I wanted to check it out.  Michelle A. joined me for some island fare.  The inside is super cute with some retro surf and tiki designs and our server was very sweet.  Now despite my love for Hawaiian stuff, I am not a big fan of fish (not on a plate nor in a bowl), which is a huge part of Hawaiian cuisine.  I was happy to see burgers and a pulled pork sandwich on the menu for us non-fisheaters.  I chose the pulled pork since I wanted to see if it lived up to the description of "heaven on a bun."  'Twas delicious.  Michelle and I also tried out the mai tais, which were quite tasty although a bit on the pricy side.  I can't be certain if it was the drink or the medicine I was taking that shouldn't be mixed with alcohol (whoops!), but wow was I glad that she had driven.  At the end of the night we each received a little mermaid figure to take with us.  A lovely little reminder of a pretty tasty Hawaiian meal.

This is me eating my words.  I mocked those who reviewed McDonald's locations and now I myself am doing that exact same thing.  Here's where I will try to redeem myself as a Yelper - I am not reviewing their food as much as I am reviewing the decor.  I will admit that McDonald's is a guilty pleasure of mine.  There are times their french fries call out to me in the night or I crave McNuggets dipped in sweet & sour sauce.  I may be drooling a bit right now, in fact.  What keeps me from frequenting there as I did in high school is both the knowledge of what goes into fast food and the fear of the oil and grease.  The fryer smell both draws and repulses me and I feel my skin getting greasy just from the proximity.  Nevertheless, if the call is strong enough, I will look beyond all that and get me a McMeal.  Such was the case recently.  After an evening of wine sampling ("wine tasting" would imply that it was in small quantities, which it was not) my fiance awoke with a mean McCraving.  He is a recently reformed fast-fooder and had gone from frequent visits to the drive-thru to having avoided it for nearly a year.  We decided that if we were going to cave, we might as well check out the recently-leveled-and-rebuilt McDonald's.  Figuring that they were new enough that the fryer, exhaust fans, etc. would still be free of too much buildup, we ventured inside.  This is seriously the best decorated McDonald's I have ever been to.  It has a mid-century modern feel to it with retro chairs, patches of dark wood flooring and what I can only describe as raised-circle-in-a-square ceramic tiles surrounding the drink/napkin/ketchup area.  I can seriously see some of the design elements being incorporated into a cool modern home.  Flabbergasting is how out-of-place it is in that area of town, where most commercial makeovers seem to involve stucco and tan paint.  We ate our food in awe of our surroundings.  Was this the future of McDonald's eateries?  Or just a fluke?  I'm hoping it's the former.  If I'm going to stuff myself with fast food, it would be nice to at least do so in a visually-pleasing environment.

So excited for a new restaurant/eatery opening in the neighborhood.  Coming from CenPho where restaurants seem to be popping up like mushrooms, new stuff around here makes me all giddy.    The Rob and I decided to check it out to see if we could have a new favorite, cheap dinner place.  There are definitely still some kinks to be worked out, but overall we were both pretty happy.  Me gusta:  + Huge drink selection (Including sodas without high fructose corn syrup!  Corn sugar is our new enemy but we love soda!)  + Cheap!  + Cute (and smart) concept naming after the neighboring high school mascot.  Especially good that said mascot is not a living creature.    + Tasty burger!  + A ton of fries!    + Expansive menu!  + Did I mention cheap?  Both of our burger combo meals totaled around $10.  Eh:  - My single burger was fine but R's Teriyaki Burger and fries were a bit greasy.  Fine for high school kids, but those of us who are now cursed with adult metabolisms need things a little lighter.  - Highlight the ability to upgrade to one of them fancy sodas.  I generally dislike the upsell, but maybe bring this to our attention somewhere on the menu (I didn't see it as an optional add-on).  - Still kind of sparse inside.  I'm all for jazzing up that menu board and the counter area.  Otherwise I have to look out the window at the gross Church's Fried Chicken and I swear I saw some sort of illicit hand-off occur behind that place while I was at the Rocket.  - All but one person working seemed a little hesitant to speak to us.  Maybe it's just us, but we don't bite, I promise.  Dude in the Jerry Bear shirt (see earlier review's hippie reference) saved the day by a super friendly goodbye.  Some of that is just me being picky.  But I'll totally be back for more tasty, cheap food.  And I'll be bringing my family when I can get them to venture to this side of the 17.

Stopped in for lunch this past weekend and the place was hoppin'!  It looks more lived in too, with more wall decorations, a bigger TV and the addition of a soda fountain.  The food was delicious, as always.  Keep up the good work!

After dining here almost every day of his week-long vacation, The Rob has decided that it is not a grease that comes off some of the burgers, (as previously stated) but a sort of au jus sauce, the contents of which is trying to break down with each visit.  Makes me feel a bit better about the massive amounts of beef, fried potatoes and fried cheese he ingested in such a short time.    Oh, and we are super hooked on the fries now too.  Like, craving hooked.  Good for them, not good for me and my estranged relationship with the elliptical machine.  Sigh.

We are questing for decent dog parks close to home and decided to check this one out.  We had been to Sahuaro Ranch Park for a party at one of the ramadas.  The park is pretty nice, so we figured we would try the section for pooches.  Best to access this park off 63rd Avenue.  There's a parking lot right by the entrance, which is always nice when you have a crazed beast or two looking to get inside to romp with new friends.  One of my boys weighs 90 lbs and the other weighs 25 but things he weighs 75, so we checked out the big dog side, where we found everyone from a Pomeranian to a Great Dane.    There are a few benches scattered around the park and agility pieces are set up along the west and north sides of the big dog enclosure.  The little one seems to have them scattered throughout.  We were there at night, but there are trees, so I'm guessing shade.  My only complaint was not with the park, but as usual, the people.  Little kids running loose and grabbing at dogs; such a recipe for disaster.  Thankfully, my dogs like (or at least tolerate) kids.  I only know this because of the numerous times we've gone to DOG parks and encountered little kids.    That wasn't the reason for our early departure though.  That would have been the gentleman who arrived with two dogs, one of them a female in heat.  I know the dog was in heat because the woman who was not watching her small children was busy talking to this guy about the dog birds-and-bees while the poor girl dog was running around the park with a pack of male dogs right on her tail.  Dog in heat + dog sausage fest = bad news.

We found this shop through my sister-in-law, who lives not too far down the road from here.  The owner, Mark, and his staff have always been super friendly and helpful even remembering our dogs' names when they come in.  It might help that the boys have been regulars at some of the great events they've hosted in the past - a Halloween costume contest (where we picked up some prizes for the Pablo's awesome costume and Frank's cute tricks) and pictures with Santa Paws  (where Pablo freaked out about Santa Paws' head, but eventually got a decent picture taken).  The store has a variety of products including collars, leashes (we were gifted a leash that reads "one of us has no balls" by my aforementioned SIL), treats, premium foods, toys and snappy outfits.  It was here that we learned that rawhide isn't the best for puppy tummies but that dried yams/sweet potatoes are an excellent alternative.  In addition to loving their Sam's Yams treats, the boys gobbled up the pumpkin cookies from holiday time, which smelled SO good I was tempted to try one myself, but I didn't.  I promise.  And, it may be wishful thinking, but it seems like the new training treats we picked up may actually be enticing Pablo to obey some commands in puppy school.    Even though I'm singing praises for all things dog, they do have plenty of goodies for cats too.  There's a laser pointer toy that The Rob always eyeballs even though we don't have a cat and Pablo would probably just chew it to bits.  It's just that cool.  And since it is a store geared towards those who truly love their pets, they even have some items up front to help remember those pets that have passed on.    Bonus: Mark is always on the lookout for products made in the good ol' USA to keep pet parents from having to worry about all those crazy contaminated pet products from abroad.  (China, I'm looking at you.)  It's definitely a great place to go with your dogs (or cats, if they are so inclined) to pick up some fun stuff.  Park West Mall is open-air and there are also some pet-friendly places there (Blu Burger patio) so you can make an afternoon of it.

This MCACC adoption site is housed in a former pet store in Metrocenter Mall and sponsored by PetSmart Charities.  It has cats and dogs available for adoption but no retail as of yet.  The store is on the lower level of the mall, near Sears.  My husband decided to cruise through Metrocenter on his recent day off and made a stop in Under One Woof.  There he saw the perfect little puppy for my father, who has been on a search for a new best friend for some time.  After some text messages, pictures and phone calls, the parents were on board and this little Malti-poo was on her way to a new home.    The volunteer who helped us was very friendly and helpful, explaining the shots the puppy had already received and providing us with information on her post-op care (MCACC had her spayed) and where to take her for a free wellness check.  There were other volunteers putting the dogs in the play area while the kennels were cleaned.  There were so many other cute dogs that needed homes, it was hard not to take another one home to join our crew at home.  Both of our dogs have been adopted from the Arizona Humane Society.  We wanted to rescue animals that needed homes rather than buying from a pet store, but I could not bear the idea of walking the prison-like halls of the pound.  This set up is bright and warm, making adopting pound puppies a little less heartbreaking.  If you're looking for a new friend, please make sure to check out Under One Woof and give a homeless pooch a new forever home!

I wasn't super impressed the first time I tried Five Guys, so I figured I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves.  Alas, I'm still pretty "meh" about them.  Burger was okay, but the fries are SUPER oily.  I know it's peanut oil, so it's supposed to be better for you, but seriously, by the time I got home, the paper bag was pretty much soaked through.  And, side note about this location, overall very clean, but no toilet seat covers in the restrooms?  What are we, heathens?

They say your eyebrows should look like sisters, not twins.  Well, before I found Amanda, my brows looked like anorexic neighbors. The little lady at the chop shop I had been visiting was slowly making my brows thinner and more misshapen each time. Amanda helped me get them back to their proper size while still keeping them presentable during regrowth. I won't let anyone else near my brows anymore and I would drive however far for Amanda's magic touch.  I'm so excited to try her new facials and let her put her perfectionism and attention to detail to work on my skin!  Did I mention that she's incredibly sweet too?  Seriously, people, what are you waiting for?  Let her get your brows in sisterly shape today!

Okay, so everyone's probably tasted Panera Bread/Paradise Bakery's food during a visit to almost any of the malls.  This location does not disappoint fans of their standard fare PLUS it has the added bonus of having a drive-through!    I have two little guys and often the idea of dragging them in and out of a place just to pick up a quick bite to eat is daunting.  Let's face it - mobilizing little ones is anything but quick.  That reduces the number of places to grab food to burgers or Mexican food, both of which I enjoy, but probably should eat in moderation. But no more!  Now I can visit this Panera Bread and pick up a soup, salad or a sandwich without waking sleeping babies in the back of the car!  As much as I love me some fries, this quick option leaves me feeling much better about myself while still saving time.  I hope this starts a new trend and the number of places with healthier drive-through options start popping up everywhere!
