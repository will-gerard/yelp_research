I've been here going on 3 years.  This past year has been pretty rough and I'm disappointed.  First my stall was changed.  I waited 6 months for it so my mother had an easier time getting to and from the apartment.  Since then, they moved it but not the same stall. They have been cooperative but I feel they should have never moved it being she is handicapped. Now I'm told my shade is in violation and needs to be taken down.  When I first moved here, we were allowed to have shading as long as it matches the building exterior.  I'm confused why it isn't allowed now.  We live in Phoenix where it gets to be over 110 degrees in the summer.  You're not allowed shade? Maintenance rocks.  This year I'm noticing roaches.  They are working with me to correct it.  I'm not as happy here as I once was. The best thing about it is, it's close to work for me.  Not a good year at all.

This complex is supposed to be a gated community.  The gate seems to be always broken.  I see homeless people going through trash bins at all times of the day.  Now my car has been vandalized.  Two tires has been stolen.  I left a message on the recording and no call back.  I tried calling again and only a recording.  I no longer feel safe living here.  I feel they should reimburse me the deductible from my Insurance.

I talked to the assistant mng and asked him if they'd share the expense for the deductible and his answer to me, " that's why you have insurance".  Well....that's why I rent from a gated community.  To feel safer and be protected from things like this from happening.  Not from a gate that's always broken and allows anyone to enter and derelicts to go through trash bins and scope out our vehicles.

I guess it would be passable to someone who is not familiar with Japanese food.  This is not authentic Japanese cuisine.  Katsu is not katsu, fried chicken bits.  Katsu sauce they offer is a plum sauce, horrible.  I would not recommend this place to friends.

Chi did a great job.  I love it!  Shining bright like a diamond.  I broke 2 nails and she fixed it.  It looks so natural, nobody would know.  Thanks Chi!

A friend turned me on to this place and now I'm hooked.  The staff is super friendly and patient.  The beignets are out of this world and made fresh to order.  They have excellent coffee and I've never been disappointed by everything I tried. That garlic aioli they serve with the fries should be bottled! You need to try it if you haven't been here yet.

I've been in Phoenix for over 8 years and I finally found someone who can cut my hair the way I like it!!!!  I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try after reading the reviews.  Nothing is exaggerated , Markis IS as good as they say.  Barbara ,the owner, did my nails.  NEVER again will I go to those   mass production places again.  No chemical burns from the primer.  The best part, I love the vibe there.  Everyone is so nice.  I feel like I found a new home. love love love I highly recommend this place!

My second time here but this time is for a pedicure.  I'm on my feet 10-12 hrs a day for work.  I also have type 2 diabetes which can cause my toenails to thicken and an occasional ingrown  (not sexy.)  Gaylee did a fantastic job!!!  She filed my nails down and fixed the botched job I got from the other salon I went to.  Their products are legal top of the line.  No burning from primers. I just can't say enough. Love love love!

Yes Barbara!!!!  Gaylee knew exactly what the problem was and what was causing my toe to hurt!  After she filed the nail down, oh what a difference!!!!  I'm so conflicted.  I'm so happy I want to tell the whole world about the fabulous "Creating Magic" and the selfish side of me wants you all for myself! hahaha

Fish torta is amazing!!!!  My new found love!  I wasn't crazy about that pastor burrito and they exchanged it for something else.  Very cool!  Definitely will be back.

Although the help needs help in customer service , the food was delish.  Keep in mind when you go, you're there for the food.
