Seriously what the hell happened to this location!?! I used to come here ALL the time over the past 2 years but I haven't been here for a couple months and disappointing is all I have to say. Came in and sat at the bar for lunch on Saturday it really wasn't that busy and it was just one thing after another. My friend and I had ordered almost the same exact meal (just slightly different) we had the fajita trio I had mine plain and she wanted hers with all the peppers, onions and spices. So our food comes out and to our surprise there is only ONE plate! Seriously idk how this guy did not here the TWO separate orders. Of course at that point we are forced to send it back and wait for another 20+ minutes for our food to come out. And of course I had to talk to the manager to make sure they didn't just put that one plate (that was completely plain mind you) under the heat lamp to sit there while they cooked the other one. I'm not going to eat some nasty heat lamp food because you messed up. So finally the food comes out after 25 minutes and the next thing I know is I look down and my plate has all sorts of spice on top of the beef, shrimp & chicken. I ask the guy why is all this nasty red spice sauce is on there and he tells me he thought I said I just didn't want peppers & onions. What part of PLAIN is that difficult to understand especially after the first plate that was brought out didn't have anything on it!  Needless to say the newer manager didn't do a damn thing no discount no apology absolutely nothing. What was supposed to be just lunch ended up into an early dinner because of their constant mistakes. I never have had a problem here so this was disappointing to say the least. I even remember when the manager who was there at the time first started & it wasn't too long ago and even then he was completely useless with a very unruly customer who was a constant disruption. Seriously bring back the Chili's I'm used to!!

BEST LOCATION IN THE VALLEY  I am writing this review today because I just want to thank the entire team there for correcting another location's awful mistake. I will reference you to my post on the FLW & Hayden location   http://www.yelp.com/biz/cobblestone-auto-spa-scottsdale-5#hrid:Xg1jTgxRJziItNvlMjauVg  Needless to say I was completely mistreated and dissatified with my experience @ the Scottsdale location. I was informed that my regular location here on Bell was actually the corporate location so I went there after my horrible experience with the FLW location. I explained to the managers (who recognized me as being a loyal customer of 7 years) about the situation at FLW and they went above and beyond to make sure that they corrected the other locations mistakes. Not only did they help me figure out who to get in contact with regarding my complaint but they took the effort to rewash my  car also they went ahead and detailed, vaccumed and sprayed my car with the air freshener. The fact that they went above and beyond to help me out I more  then appreciate. This is the location i typically go to and I regret not going here in the first place (then I would have avoided the awful service and experience I got from Shawn @ the FLW location) If I could give this location more then 5 stars I would because they always provide me with excellent customer service. The manager's Guillermo and Larry are absolutely fabulous and great examples of what a manager should be and how to correctly handle the situation.    Again I want to thank everybody at this location for making things right and continuously providing me with excellent customer service and treating me with nothing but respect.   AVOID FRANK LLOYD RIGHT & HAYDEN LOCATION AT ALL COSTS!

AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING DISRESPECTED AND TREATED LIKE COMPLETE GARBAGE BY THE G.M.  My rating for this store is a -20 stars!  I have been a customer of Cobblestone for 7 years now and I typically go to the one on the 51 & Bell. Needless to say that is the only location I will be going to after my awful experience at the FLW store. I am a fast-pass member and happened to be in the area of FLW & Hayden so I stopped by to get my car wash ( it was convenient at the time) The exterior wash  I signed up for includes air freshener squares. I had my window rolled down to ask about getting a specific scent. The man at the front of the wash completely ignored me and actually ended up spraying me with the hose they use to get the junk of the hood of your car. Needless to say I was completely unhappy. As i went through the wash I parked my car in order to let the guy dry it and went up to somebody asking about why i did not receive what I paid for. The guy I spoke to about this is supposedly the General Manager of that store named Shawn, and never in my life have I been treated with such blatant disrespect. He raised his voice and started arguing with me in front of his employees as well as other customers ( I was so embarrassed) that the wash I had did not come with the air freshener squares. I explained to him that when I signed up I was informed that my wash included the squares and every single time I get my car washed at Greenway or Bell I have always received exactly what I paid for. Shawn kept arguing with me basically calling me a liar and told me that the other locations only did it because I requested them or they were just being nice which I stated that they "were doing their job correctly." I also informed him that I have been to this location (being FLW) and received them there too. Shawn continued to argue with me over and over about something as simple as an air freshener which I find absolutely ridiculous. Never have I had somebody treat me so poorly let alone a General Manager (who is supposed to be setting an example and be a leader) After a few minutes another man came up and said he would be right back with the air freshener for me ( he could hear Shawn yelling and arguing with me over all the back ground noise which was a lot considering it was about 4:00 PM. and it was pretty busy) I proceeded to specifically thank the gentleman for taking care of that for me and the next thing I know Shawn says "Your Welcome" and tried taking all the credit for doing absolutely nothing and being a complete A**Hole. I let him know that clearly I was not speaking to him that he deserved no "Thank you" or anything from me, and the next thing I know he is calling me a B**ch under his breath. In response I asked him to speak up louder which of course he had nothing to say at that point. I have never had such an awful experience at anywhere I have been a customer to. The fact that Shawn is supposed to be the General Manager is completely absurd and I find hard to believe with his horrible attitude and lack of respect. I will never return to this location and I advise all of you not to as well. Shawn is the absolute worst manager of any kind that I have spoken to and I can not believe he still has a job here. To paint a clearer picture I went to the corporate location (51 & Bell) and began telling their manager about my experience and before I could even inform him of Shawn's name the manager at Bell already knew who I was talking about. The fact that I didn't even have to share his name just goes to show what a horrible reputation Shawn has not only at his store but at other locations as well. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER!

Glad they closed! Catch is not what it used to be back at the beginning. The food got less then mediocre and don't get me started on the service. The waitresses recently were extremely incompetent and was sad that they couldn't get an order right. I should name names but I won't get that nasty but needless to say but the staff became more useless as the days went on.   I miss the old catch....the new owners just ruined everything and they hired the most incompetent people it was pitiful. Hopefully a new bar will come in with owners that know what they are doing and don't hire such idiots as the last owner did. Honestly I can't feel bad for the staff that lost their jobs because they all sucked horribly!

In town for my birthday got hungry and found this place on Yelp. I was so surprised because it was so delicious! The fried mushrooms are definitely in the top 2 I have ever had in my life mmmmm They were so large and breaded perfectly and paired with some great ranch sauce! The pizza was good I mean nothing too spectacular. My brother had the wings he thought they were good. Delivery time was decent and placing a phone order wasn't too complicated. I just can't get over the mushrooms will definitely be ordering again when I return to Vegas.

Wow so just left this location that I come to EVERYDAY and had the displeasure of having GARY ring me out and what can I say other then this guy is a complete douche and has awful customer service. Every day that I come here I get the best service from everybody else even have conversations with them. I would say almost every person that works at that location knows me and my brother so I never expect to run into an issue here. I will definitely be mentioning this to my usual people when I go in tomorrow. Would love to hear from a manager!!   PS. Gary learn to lighten up and get your head out of your ass
