I've been going to C&R Tire for about 2 years now, I have a small fleet of vehicles for my car service, Black and White Limo, and C&R has kept them on the road for the past 2 years.    Being a small new company, we don't have tons of money to spend on costly repairs.  C&R won our business by being less expensive than their competitors, especially when it comes to tires (cheaper than Discount Tire).  They also get the job done in less time then any other shops we have been to.   Their lifetime warranty on most parts and service is unmatchable and invaluable for our business.  Thankfully they do such a good job, we haven't had to have any of the same repairs done more than once.  The current manager at this location, Jeff, is a great guy, easy to work with and always has the customers best interest in mind. C&R won't lie to you and tell you that you need crazy expensive services right NOW like lots of shops do.  If they notice something, they will tell you about how long you have until you would need that service for sure so you know and you can save up your money.  I have had the privilege of meeting both the owners and working with them on several occasions when they stop into this location, both are awesome.  This company truly cares about their customers and will not rip you off.  Take your next service to them, you won't be disappointed.  They have earned a customer for life, even though we have moved further away, it's still worth the drive.

We just hired Efficiency Mechanical to come out to our house we recently purchased to install an exhaust fan in our master bathroom and to re-insulate our attic.  Matt came out to give us estimates and was very helpful in answering all questions we had about adding the insulation and the exhaust vent.  He got back to us very fast with a very fair quote and we chose to use their services.  A few days later, we set up a time for them to come do the work, the two guys who showed up were very friendly and I could tell they were knowledgeable about what they were doing.  I wish I could remember their names, they were great.  They put down protection to cover our flooring, etc. so it wouldn't get damaged or dirty during the process.  They installed the fan first and then blew in the insulation.    During the installation of the vent, they came to me to let me know that our other bathroom's vent duct work was not installed properly and the flapper was not opening fully, they let me know they had already fixed it for me, even though it was not a part of the scope of work included in their bid.  They also told me one of our A/C ducts was leaking air...which they also fixed without asking for any more money.  This was all extra work they didn't have to do, or they could have asked for more money, but being an ethical company, they made sure they were not just adding what we asked for, but making sure everything around it was working properly as well.  All in all, it seemed as they finished the job pretty quick and came to me to inspect their work before they left.  There were a few drywall nails that had popped out a little bit in the ceiling from their cutting and/or walking (crawling) around the attic.  They grabbed their drywall compound right away and patched up all the holes, without any question as to whether they caused them or not.  They offered to come back to paint over the compound for us as well which we declined as I already had other patch paint work to do from the electrician before them.  They let me climb up to the attic to inspect the insulation (verify the depth agreed on) and were on their way.  Altogether a great experience (rare for a lot of contractors) but if we ever need mechanical work on this house or any others down the road, Efficiency has earned a customer for life, thanks for the great work!

Called Alan a couple weeks ago after buying and moving into a new house because there was no air blowing through the vent in the master bathroom.  He asked if I could meet him the next morning at 8am, I drove over to meet him and he was there right on time!  He checked out the problem and called me to say the duct was crushed and just needed a small new piece of duct.  He tried to find the exact type of duct but they don't sell it anymore so he ran a new duct line and did all this for about $100, I was expecting much worse.  He is honest, well priced, and a great guy to work with.  I just called him back this afternoon and he was here within a couple of hours when I asked if/how we could get any more air to the bathroom so he came and adjusted all our vents so that all rooms are getting equal air and it is now working great!  He gave us a few other possible suggestions on how we could improve air flow easily and went out of his way to make us a happy customer, this is 5+ stars in my book, especially for a contractor, he is great!

I didn't even recognize my girlfriend when she came home from Kohler/Penrose Academy.  She went in a dark haired brunette and came home 5 hours later an orangish, strawberry blonde after asking for them to make her hair slightly lighter than the dark brown shade it already was.  The job they did was awful.  My girlfriend came home crying because the color was so terrible.  She told them her hair pulled red and they kept assuring her that they wouldn't let that happen but yet she came home some orange, red, blonde shade of some color other than brunette.  I would not recommend anyone go to this school, you definitely get what you pay for.  If you are going to pay half price for something, you are probably only going to get someone with half the quality of a professional.  She told them when she went in that she had to be somewhere at a specific time and they kept saying no problem, she would be out of there on time.  Of course she was late and it took 5 hours for a cut and color and as she was trying to rush out of there, the stylist forgot to fill out her log of what she did so my girlfriend had to wait at the front desk while she filled out her papers before they would check her out, making her even more late.  She didn't even let them finish blow drying because they were so slow and she was so late.  I told her to go get her money back and asked why she even paid for it but she was so mad that she just paid and ran out.  She went back the next day to get a refund because she had to make an appointment with a professional salon to fix what they screwed up but they said they can't refund money since it's a learning school.  They did offer to fix it or try to make it better for free and that is happening while I am writing this and I am even more scared how much more they will screw it up.  We'll see how well they try to fix it but if you are a girl who cares about your hair, do not go to this school.  You are better off coloring your hair at home or spending the money on a professional because you'll just end up spending more money trying to fix what they screwed up at this school.  And by the way, this if my first ever yelp review.  I don't usually review places but this place was so terrible I couldn't even believe they are teaching people how to do hair, it was awful.  People need to know how bad this place is.

Let me preface this by saying I only write reviews when I receive exceptionally good service or absolutely terrible service and this is one of the worst.  The complaint is more against the corporate office and the company as a whole rather than this car wash location.  Here is the complaint I just filed with the BBB.....I borrowed my brother-in-laws black Chevy Tahoe and it was dirty when I got it so I went straight to the Danny's car wash on Northsight to get it cleaned up.  This was on Friday 12/21.  When the car came out of the car wash and I got home, I noticed a paint scratch about the size of a nickel and that the bumper had been pulled away from the fender on the front lower left side of the car.  I called my brother-in-law to ask him if he knew anything about that and he said no, he had not seen that so we assumed it happened during the car wash.  I called the car wash to ask if they have video tapes and they said they did and gave me a number to call to speak to Brian at the corporate office about it.  I did speak to Brian and after a few phone calls he told me he would leave the video at the car wash for me to pick up on the 28th or 29th.  I went to pick it up and the manager at the store told me the video would not play on the car wash computer in their office and so I took the disc home and there was nothing on the disc when I got it home.  I was given Brian's cell phone number where I left him 5-7 voice mails over the period of 1.5 weeks and another 4-5 messages were left at the corporate office for Brian to call me back.  I spoke with Corey at the corporate office many times and he told me Brian is not typically in the office but he would have Brian call me.  Brian has never called me back now 2 weeks after I was supposed to receive the video.  I then spoke with Vivian on 1/4 at the corporate office who tried to assist and was told I would have a video ready to pick up on Monday 1/7.  No one called me on Monday the 7th so I called Vivian who told me that Brian is going through treatment for cancer so he is in and out of the hospital and that he was in the hospital and they did not know when he would be out.  I asked if I could speak to someone above him to get this resolved and she said no, that would not help because the video is on Brian's lap top.  I asked if they knew how long he would be in the hospital and they could not give me a time frame.  Finally I asked Vivian if she could please give my phone number to a General Manager and have someone call me back on Tuesday 1/8 and she said "sure" in a very snotty voice.  I knew she wasn't going to ask anyone to call me but I left it at that and waited.  Tuesday went by and no one called as I expected with the past history of no one calling me back ever.  All I want is to see the videos from the car wash to find out if the damage to the car occurred while at the car wash or not.   It is hard for me to believe that there is no one else who can help me if one of their employees is in the hospital for an unknown amount of time.  It has been almost 3 weeks since the day I got the car washed and I just want to see the video.  I've left at least 10-12 voice messages or messages with people at the office and none of those calls have been returned.  I have been calling the corporate office ever day and nothing is getting done.  I actually like the service I get at this car wash location and they do a pretty good job but if you ever have to deal with Corporate, you better watch out and expect to never have calls returned and your issue never resolved.  They tell you no one works in the office who deals with customers and they are all in the field.  This company is run very poorly and their customer service is terrible.  Both people at the office, Corey and Vivian, are very rude and seem to not know anything about what is going on.  Use Danny's cautiously and hope you don't run into any customer service issues.  I will be finding myself a new car wash to go to and I run a transportation company where I visit the car wash multiple times weekly, they have lost some good business.

They said the tow would be there within the hour, it took about an hour and 25 minutes.  Other than that everything was great, the driver was very good.  Small hiccup with the yelp discounts, they offered two for $10 off each and one they refused to accept (driver and office worker went back and forth for a while) but after I purchased a different offer, it all worked out.  All in all, would use again, standard tow company, but pretty good rates!

James at Sunset Tint is the best!  I can't say I've used any other service to compare but he has taken tint off and put new on, tinted over existing tint, and redone a previous owners tint for us on 4 different vehicles ranging from a Fiat 500 (tiny) to a full size Chevy Suburban (large).  My wife and I run a car service, Black and White Limo, and he has tinted every one of our vehicles.  We are a small business so we can't spend $1000's on window tint and James has always worked within our budget and always made time for us when we needed to get something done.  He even has free wifi in his shop if you need to hang out while he gets the job done, cannot complain at all, I have and will refer anyone looking for window tint to James!

Robert is one of the best barbers in town, if not THE best.  I have been going to him for over a year and even when I change how I want my hair cut, it always comes out perfect.  He has gotten busier over the months I've been going there so once in a while you might have to wait for one or two people in front of you but he always keeps it moving quickly while paying close attention to each individual customer.  He is definitely worth the wait even though many times you won't have to wait at all.  Robert has some people working for him in the shop from time to time to help with his busy periods and each of them that I have had cut my hair has done just as good of a job.  He is right next to the Dunkin Donuts on the NW corner of Hayden and Thomas, easy to grab a coffee while he holds your place in line.  Try him out, you won't be disappointed.

Been coming in here a couple years now.  At first I wasn't impressed but I came back after a while going to other places and I'm happier with their wash here over any other full service places around.  Sometimes it's a little slow but so is every other wash store.  The staff is super friendly and always give good deals when extras are needed (carpet shampoo, hand wax, detail, etc.)  Good employees who work hard and care about your car being clean.  Of those in the area, I'd recommend this over the others.  Buy a 10 - wash pack if you wash frequently, save yourself $4/wash on the basic.

Jeff and Arrange a Ride are great!  He is always professional and all vehicles are always clean (and non-smoking).  We have referred people to him and gotten calls after raving about their great experience.  Airports, weddings, proms, he does it all, great guy to work with and very reliable.  Will continue using his services whenever needed!

Maya Day and Nightclub might be the worst concept ever.  How can you be a "beach club" with a pool and not allow sandals at night?  Riddle me that...

We called LA Development as a referral from a friend and got in touch with Rusty who came out to our house to give us a quote and help us with some design aspects of our backyard remodel.  All we had when we bought our house was a 10'x20' covered patio, one oleander and a bunch of dead grass/dirt.  After getting a few quotes, we felt most comfortable with LA Development and their numbers also met our budget.  We went ahead and had them put in about 700sf of sod surrounded by 18 tons of granite/gravel and about 16-18 plants including one large tree.  Rusty took us out to the nursery where we could pick out plants and see what we were picking at the same time.  This really helped seeing the colors and with Rusty's knowledge of the plants, helped us pick low water, non-shedding plants for easy maintenance.  We also went to look at the granite/gravel where they buy from so we could pick out the exact color we wanted in person.  We chose to go with a paver border around the new grass which they put in much nicer pavers than they had quoted for us which they chose because it matched our existing travertine tile on our patio.  We had all this done last October and unfortunately with how hot it was when the plants went in and the few days of freezing temps shortly after, we lost several plants.  We contacted LA Development who was more than happy to come back out and replant the plants that didn't make it.  They also fixed a couple new drippers they had installed that had gotten clogged and did a little repair on the grass.  Now, just a couple months after all their repairs, our backyard is coming to life!  It has so much color, almost every plant is in full bloom and our water bill isn't even that much.  They installed new irrigation in the backyard and front and our front yard plants are flourishing now as well.  I would highly recommend using LA Development, especially if you want artificial turf because what I've seen from facebook, they do some amazing work with that stuff and even install new pools!  We will definitely use them the next chance we get!

My wife and I recently attended a good friend's wedding at Bella Rose.  I personally had never heard of it before, but it sounded like a really cool venue.  My wife and I, also newly weds, got married at a different venue in Scottsdale and never considered this location since A. I had never heard of it...maybe my wife did but who knows, and B. We were looking for venues in Scottsdale for better geographic's for us and our family/friends.  If I would have known about this place before we got married, it would have been a serious contender.  We were looking for an outdoor ceremony and this place had an amazing setting.  We were extremely pleased with the venue we went with but I had one of the best times at this wedding at Bella Rose that I've had at any of my friend's recent weddings.  The outdoor ceremony was beautiful, not just because of the bride and groom but the setting was awesome with all the greenery and the large gazebo/outdoor covered patio type thing they got married under.  The "cocktail hour" was also outside with a large patio area and more grass greenery and an outdoor fountain with a great area for socialization and of course...a bar to serve!  The reception/dinner was indoors with access to the outdoors to refresh our drinks.  There were also sitting areas outside to enjoy the evening.  The table decorations inside were great, nice set up with DJ booth, dance floor, etc. and plenty of room for customization.  The food was great (we enjoyed buffet style), the restrooms were clean, and everything seemed to go off without a hitch.  I got a chance to talk to Chad (the owner?) for a little bit at the end of the wedding while all the guests were leaving and he was cleaning up.  He seemed like a great guy to work with and passionate about the job/business, and although I didn't have my wedding here (because I didn't know about the place and it was outside our search radius), I would highly recommend at least stopping by to anyone searching for a venue!

We found Phoenix Sliding Doors through searching the internet and after contacting 3-4 companies, Maurice at PSD was the low bid on installing some solar screens so we chose him.  We contacted him on a Friday, he set an appointment to come out and measure that Monday with a 3 hours window, he called us with 30 minute notice and said he would be there early and wanted to know if he could come early, which was great as I was home.  He measured and set up an installation appointment for that Thursday between 3pm and 6pm, he called with 30 minute notice again and said he could come early around 2:30, I told him I'd be home at 3 so go ahead and get started and I'll meet him when I get home.  By the time I got home at 3:15 he was done, the solar screens looked great and the function (darkening/cooling our bedroom and master bathroom) was amazing.  I will be calling Maurice again to do more of our windows and would recommend his company for any of their services.  He not only shows up on time, he calls ahead, shows up early, and gets the job done quick and at the best price we could find.  Thanks Phoenix Sliding Doors!

I would have given them 5-stars if they weren't so unethical, its a fun place and cool environment.  Twice now they have overcharged me on my bar tab, ie. a $34 tab which I signed and tipped $6 should equal $40, I was charged $51.  This was the second time, the first time I went to close my tab at the bar and the bartender said "oh, we already closed your tab" without me signing anything.  They gave me no receipt or anything for the amount.  I later see my credit card was charged $70, $30 and $5, none of which I was offered a receipt for.  I believe we spent around $50-$60, not $105.  I called the bar, no one has ever answered the phone, I also emailed from their website with no response.  I don't care about the money so I won't be fighting it (not worth my time) but if I ever go back here or to Maya, I will be paying with cash only.  Be careful as well, they will not let you in wearing a Bulls jersey while the Bulls are playing a playoff game on every tv in the bar....yet people with no shirt are welcome to roam freely.

We tried to get brunch today around Noon (on a Sunday) and walked in and a server walking by said "we'll be right with you".  A few min. went by a few more servers walked by, I guess they don't have hostesses and finally someone asked if we'd been helped and found us a table (they weren't busy).  We sat down, no one came to take a drink order, after a while the guy who sat us came back and said he guessed he'd get us drinks too.  He dropped off our bottomless mimosas and left.  We sat for a good 10min. and no one stopped by.  We asked a server walking by if he could find us a server, we see him go talk to 3-4 other servers, looked like no one knew whose table we were.  By now 20min. of sitting there looking at their very limited choice menu that is WAY over priced for a breakfast joint ($10 for ONE egg?) We had finished our first mimosas that were supposed to be bottomless and still no server.  We left some cash on the table and walked out.  Come on people, who cares whose table it is, SOMEONE take it.  Terrible service, menu looked horrible, guess we'll never know if their one egg for $10 is worth it?!  Almost forgot, they sat 4 of us with one menu.  A second came a few min. later and we finally had 4 menus after probably 5min. of sitting down.
