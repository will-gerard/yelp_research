This place is awesome! The staff is very welcoming, I love reading books so any type of book I can get my hands on I'm happy. They have all sorts if authors new and used books. Collectors editions, movies (dvds/vhs), cds/vinyl, magazines and many more. The comic books are priced well and in good condition. You can get a whole lot of books for a low price.

Worst service ever. Walked in and the woman rolled her eyes at me. Lol I'm not sure what I did. It was pretty empty and very clean. Walked around looking for a item for a good 15 min and no help. It want busy at all. The salons looked clean there was no staff for walk ins.

Their service is horrible which is a surprise because nobody its hardly in there. I visit a VS store 2-3 times a month.  I came into this site it was bout really packed I needed help and was ignored the whole time. Someone came in I heard the "Welcome to Victoria Secret,  can i help you find anything" it kinda felt like a slap in my face. When I was paying for my stuff the woman asked if anyone helped me.  I had explained to her that everyone ignored me when I seeked help m the service was horrible. All she did was continue to ignore and have a dude conversation. I ended up leaving the stuff I was going to buy because I was so disgusted.

I'm not even sure I want to give this place 2 stars. I used to come here... After leaving rollero. Boy... Has this place changed. The floor has holes... The "golfers" are more into talking to their buddies... I saw at least 8 kids bust their ass and it was right behind one of them... I felt so bad for the kids one even got ran over. A bottle of water is 3.00 I'm not sure what kind of magical water that is but damn it must be magical. This place was bomb when Zack and Andrew where here. I guess the 8-12 someone has to be 18 or older and I'm pretty sure I saw at least 5 "kids" that were not 18. Music is the same as it used to be which is awesome. I'm pretty sure next time I would take my money to Ghetto Rollero.

We always order from this Domino's. The delivery drivers are awesome the are on time and polite. I love ordering online the pizza tracker is very helpful, my son likes to watch it because it tells him how long it will take for the pizza to get here.  The pizza was great it was hot and fresh! Great service which gave a great tip. The pizza arrived earlier then what it said but I am not complaining.

I brought one of my patients here that was suicidal. The wait was pretty long... The one thing that caught me by surprise is the nurse that allowed my client to go outside that was "suicidal" go outside to smoke a cigarett after I told her that she was suicidal she continued to tell her yes. I told the nurse she should not be outside due to being suicidal and thanks for making such a horrible decision as she could just run in front of a car and thank you. As I walked out the nurse said your welcome. The waiting area was so little it was a little unclean. There wasn't a whole lot of space to sit people had to stand up.

I love this place! My son loves to see the aquarium and wildlife.  Although, they are constantly adding more and more but it doesn't interrupt the views and attractions. The some staff are very friendly and some seem distracted by dude conversations. The ticket prices are good we get ours from Luke AFB. My son loves to feed the giraffes and of course mocking the birds.

This place is great! They have the best wings and I love that the veggies are extra fresh. As a kid my best friend her parents (a wonderful Italian Family) used to come here a lot and used to get to go orders. Their pizza is amazing now as a mother and wife I take my husband pizza and wings from here all the time.  The family owned restaurant is awesome they definantly appreciate the men and women in the service!  GREAT JOB PULLANO'S!

I used to go to this mall as a youth. Then it was a major mall, I have noticed that slowly it's gone down as far as their marketing audience. Some of the stores are great and provide amazing service. On the other hand a lot of stores the employers are more focused on side conversations and texting. Its very crowded a lot of children running around unattended.  Its clean but ita probably because the cleaners are always on the floor with their carts. Burlington coat factory is sometimes over stocked its sometimes hard to find items.

I came here on a spontaneous whim.  When first walking in you get a humongous wif of fish... if you are not used to going to a fish market you probably wont be able to get pass the stench of fish.   The shelf's are all stocked with different culture foods. Majority of produce is fresh I loved the fresh okra. Beautiful selections.   In the sea food section they had live catfish, lobster, crabs, and other selections as well as dead fresh fish. They cut and clean it there... they were very helpful and the area was very clean inside.

The store always looks dirty. It seems like everytime I go there is someone outside trying to sale or needs donations (not that I am not for giving) it takes away from shopping.  It seems like there are never enough cashiers. What is the point in having all the lanes if there are only 2 open. I love how the store workers have side conversations and text on their phones. The floors usually are sticky and dirty.   The workers some you can tell hate their job and are waiting for lunch or to get off. It makes you want to go to Target in stead and just pay the extra cost.

I love coming here. The staff is always friendly, I usually go thru drive thru. Sometimes the monitor works and sometimes it doesnt. The staff typically has the order right and depending what day of the week it is your food is yummie. Sometimes it is burnt if its the younger crowd in the kitchen. But its quick service and if they get something in your order wrong they fix it quick. Kudos

It is close to home, I love going during the week because the food and service. The service on the weekends is very slow. One night my husband and I went and it was not yet closing hours and as we drove up to the drive in they shut off the lights at the drive in and at the windows. They mix up our orders a WHOLE lot and it seems like we cannot get quality fries they are either old or cold.

I love this place! Very clean, professional, and helpful. I came in the day before to make an appointment. Was able to get in by Jason. He was very helpful had great communication skills. Clean and sterilized tools and the tattoo was truly just like what I had asked for. The shop is very clean and has plenty of tattoos to refer to when,just walking in. I watched them complete piercings and I loved how the woman explained to the girl in full detail how to take care of it. She even offered to allow her to come in to help get it cleaned. I would defiantly come back and recommend this to anyone.

Worst service ever.  I've never had any issue with getting a hot fudge with a love it... even when i go to corporate in scottsdale they do it with no problem.    Tables were dirty, one of the staff didn't know how to make several things.   Side conversations about customers when they dispute a problem. Stock items on counters where food is.

Im a tad bit disappointed.  My husband has been bringing his car here before we met. Mainly because they pretty much catered to his rims. I decided to take his car in for the #4.   When we pulled up several of them were just standing around talking. I waited for a minute and of course they tried to tell me they could fix a crack in my windshield I let them know I didnt need it and my husbands insurance was. If course he told me they took insurance and they could do it. (Just felt a bit pushy).  I waited for the car to get done and waited.. and cars that had pulled up way after me was coming out with soap... dirt... and mud still on them. Which made my anxiety arise due to paying 22.99 for a Supreme.   Finally, my husbands precious car came out soap and all. She appeared just like new (hopefully the change was there... but she just sat after coming out while the cleaners just stood around...  I did my wash check of course scratches was on my husbands presious rims... along with tire scratches. Dust on the sesh board and thr occasional French frys from when I snuck the McDonald's before.  Im not sure what my husband sees in this place but im defiantly going to Danny's next time.

I love this location. This dollar tree is always clean and typically has everything Wal-Mart has for cheaper. It is always stocked and if not the workers are so gracious to check in the back.   I kobqe coming in because not matter what the worker is doing they greet and ask if need any help. The floors are clean and even though topically it isn't busy the staff helps and communicates well.

You can never expect too much when shopping at any Wal-Mart. Of course like always I test ro figure out why I didn't go to target.  Fun fact!  Wal-Mart sits on a old mall and a movie "eight legged freaks" was filmed there before they tore it down. This Wal-Mart is like all the others dirty... unorganized... occasional rude workers.

I love this place. I've been going for years. It is family owned and it has majority if what you need. Braiding hair, tracks, wigs, lace fronts, and half wigs. The have a big selection on perm, shampoo, conditioners, and hair growth products. They always have someone to help on the floor and someone to work the cash register. The sections are typically organized everything is sectioned off. The prices are good and sometimes high but if you want quality hair you will pay. Regardless the service is great.

This location is across from safeway on litchfield and indian school. This is a Market place, so majority of the stuff here is groceries. I love coming here because it is convenient and closer to my home. Every time I come in they are cleaning which I love, the shelves are always stocked with items. Fresh produce and baked goods. During holidays they have beautiful displays when you walk in. There is 2 red box as well as carpet cleaner rental.  Sometimes areas are hard to get to due to leaving merchandise still boxed in areas. Typically, I hate check out because sometimes you run across cashier's that have side conversations. But also you run in contact with friendly cashier's that are real helpful. If you are having a hard time with self checkout sometimes it's hard to get help because the person on duty night be off taking to a co worker.

I love this place. Although, I always order to go but it never fails whatever I order its 15 minutes until pick up. I've eaten inside once and it is VERY clean. My son loves to go inside to see the fish on display Ib the tank. The portions that they provide is very big always room for left overs. The staff is super friendly and although I am a regular they really take the time to get to know their customers.  I usually get the chicken fried rice and orange chicken which is AWESOME! I love their egg drop soup. They also have yummie egg rolls. Coupons on their pamphlets as well as a great 10% military discount.

This place was great. Our server he was very very awesome. I went to meet my mom and step dad to have dinner. The woman at the front was very polite and greeted. It is inside the mall also has an outside patio area to eat.  I worried because it was so packed we might get slow service. Jason was very punchioual with bringing out our drinks. He recommended the frizen margaritas which was really good. They brought out corn bread which I've never really been a fan of. But surprisingly it was really good. We didn't wait long for it food, I could tell it cane out fresh. I ordered the green chili enchiladas which was great. They gave me about a spoonful of rice and like half my plate was full of blan black beans.   The restrooms were very clean, I give 4 stars because it felt a little dark, the beans, and the rice.  Gutentag

I love this library. My 4yr old son and I go 2 times a month we are always in the kids area. The collection display we always look forward to seeing as well as the Lego display.  We have been to story time which my son loves a lot. I let my son free to get books as well occasionally he will pick a few DVDs to watch. The childrens librarian is very helpful if you ever need help. They have a computer area for kids thag is kid friendly.   The bathroom is kid friendly the size is great for them to be comfortable.  They also have an are for Spanish. A documentary selection for kids and young youth, the comic book selection is cool. There is a study area for kids to read and a little activity center.

I had been wanting to come here with my son for the longest. I finally went on (First Friday) which is a free night.   I came around 4/5:00 and it was a little packed. The staff all smiled and greeted well. The museum was VERY packed. There are 3 floors and each level was truly fun.   My main concern was the 1st floor the 3 level obstacle course. Although, my son is 4 and the staff said it was for all ages and the staff said I could go in with him. When I went in it was hard because kids were pushing my son as well in the "Noodle forrest" my son was probably pushed down 4 times.   While in the pizza or grocery store room it was cute my son defiantly enjoyed his time. It was cute the only set back was parents not encouraging their children to share and kids that were 10/12 play in on things when obviously a younger peer wanted to give it a try.

My first journey of finding a car was here. My husband and I planned on being there for awhile. Originally I went because my husband bought his car here. I understand they don't hassle you, but when I and My husband walked in we couldn't even get help so we both walked outside to look. The selection wasn't a lot to choose from but I ended up finding a Kia. Still couldn't get help and was very disappointed in the service.  I ended up calling after leaving and waiting a hour and not getting help while the staff were just sitting around. My husband encouraged me to go back which we planned to after we both got off work. My husband went in his uniform and right away we received help we couldn't even get into the door. I ended up getting a brand new Kia. I had the car for 3 months and the radiator busted. I had the car towed to carmax they ended up sending it to Kia. They completed a buy back.  They ended up letting me choose another car but before that they rented me a older Kia so I could get around (which was like a slap in my face).  I ended up getting a Dodge Dart with extended services, my car started to act a little funny so I decided to take it in as far as my moon roof glitching and the steering  wheel locked up when I was driving. It took several months for me to get a hold to anyone in maintenance I was pretty much in tears because I didn't want to drive my car because I didn't want it to lock up while I was driving it.  When I finally got a hold of someone name William he set up an appointment but didn't even apologize for how long I had waited or the fact that I had been on hold for 37minutes.  I brought the car in and he took the car and drove into the service area and wiggled the steering wheel and clicked the sunroof off and on and them came in and told me there would me a diagnosis charge. (Wtf) really you didn't even look at it. So I called my husband and we took it to Larry H. Miller dodge and they wouldn't even let me leave with the car until it was fixed due to it being a liability. Thank God for Larry H. Miller for catching the issue.

I waited 20 minutes for something simple. I thought I learned my lesson the last time I came here. It is connected to a glass station but when you go inside it kind of gives off a unclean feeling.  Its your average fast-food place. Slow service, young high school students... the food could be better but it takes training I guess.

I needed to board my furbabies while I traveled out the country. My husband and I boarded our 2 kiddos Hershey (German Sheppard mix) and Riley (American Staffordshire terrier). I dropped them off on a Friday on dropped off they put the little rope around their necks like they do at the pound to escort them. I explained to the guy that Hershey gets nervous about it due to her previous placement, they did it anyways.   They are a little pricey but honestly it us well worth it. They have 24hr staffing, A/C and heater units. They have a beautiful pool area an cuddle time.  They offer various of services. When my kiddo Riley came home I noticed that he had scars on his paws and Hershey had major hair loss. The woman told me thay she was going to communicate with me throughout the time of the kiddos visit. I didn't hear from them until I emailed asking her until the last few days.  They moved my kiddos to another sweet which defiantly did not approve of and did not understand why they moved them without my approval. They said Riley was aggressive and protective towards his sister and didn't want anyone near her which he had never been aggressive towards anyone unless he feels or seen then hurt her.   The place is beautiful and the staff is awesome. Just don't get robbed because they don't have too much sympathy. I'm not sure if we would bring them back.

I am really iffy on giving this party city 2 stars. The staff seemed side tracked and in their own world. I decided to find the items I needed on my own. (I was tired of asking for help)  The merchandise was all over, a little on the trashy side. I was very surprised by the way it looked. Seemed to me like they didnt take any pride in their store. I ordered balloons and they seemed to gotten my order mixed up with someone else's. Which was a little frustrating.   During Halloween it is of course often packed, but the first time i had ever went I saw one of thw staff stepping on their own merchandise to get pass customers. Some were interested in making conversations with  "cute customers"

I have been here 2 times.   The first time i went, my husband and I went it was for a date night. We waited for a table and our buzzards never went off and there was obviously 4 tables open. I finally asked and the woman said "oh, I'm sorry" and actually put us next to the bar. It took forever to get food... and when it came out it was cold. But our server she was awesome. The food was cold and it I just was not seeing what all the talk was about.  The 2nd time myself and some other military wives came last night. Although it took forever to get a drink which I was not understanding why because not a lot of people were ordering drinks. I often order the same drinks... and I ordered a "Pink Pu**y" which it did not taste like it at all. I felt there was more juice than anything.   It mostly felt like a boring bar... there was water on the floor when I was walking out ans nearly busted my bottom. (Can you guys mop?)

I have been coming here, to get my family pictures done since my son was a baby. I love the different rooms but every time we go I definitely wish there was some type of privacy. The employers are great they are very patient and they take their time. Occasionally, you will run into the worker that uses the same poses every time you come. The bathrooms are always clean.  They always have a sweet deal with a coupon. They try real hard to get you to spend more money. But I d efinantly enjoy coming I'm every time.

We had an appointment at a different place and the woman at yhe frony desk she called childrens hospital to see if iy was there instead. She was sweey enough tk ask the childrens hospital if they could allow us to come since we were missinformed. So I took my nephew in to see the neurologist at the children's hospital. It was so welcoming and clean. Although, the woman at the front desk seemed to of been having a bad day. My son wanted a sticker and he couldn't decide what he wanted and she said "hurry up and pick one or I will choose one" she seemed very impatient because it was onky a second it took him to decide she then counted 1..2..3. I pick. The dr he was very welcoming he explained everything that my nephew needed and how to help him. My son even enjoyed his time with the dr and he wasnt even being seen.

I came in and was told that there would be a 45 minute to a one hour wait... Someone behind me was told that there would be a 3 hour wait...   The place is clean, I came in for a drug screen and a TB test for work, which I really didn't think would take so long. Inside the lobby this man was complaining that they dumped his piss because it wasn't the right temp. Another man was complaining that he wasn't injured after he ran a red light and hit some people.   The front staff was very polite and helpful. It just seems like they are understaffed and just take FOREVER. there are two tv's in the lobby and information pamphlets. Plenty of chairs and the staff uniform and hygiene is very appropriate.

Its really cluttered inside.  It seems like it is real unorganized and when asking where items are they seem to be clueless of where things are.   Some products are opened so be careful when putting items in your basket or buying them. The bakery is nice they have a verity of goods.  Only issue is its a bit unorganized. My best friend ordered a cake and it just didnt taste too well.

Came in on a Saturday night with my step dad and step brother and my son. We waited at the sign where it says "please wait to be seated" we waited and the guy asked if we were dining in and he said we could seat ourselves.   The waiter came and handed out menues. I glanced around to other booths it was a lil empty. But at the same time several tables were dirty.   Our food came out right away. The server came to our table once to see if we needed any thing.  We ordered pizza and 12 wings. The wings were okay a little under cooked. But the pizza was great.   The also do military discount.  Great for family and big crowds.  There are several televisions that show sporting events as well as outdoor eating.

I came in with my sorority sisters and they had put boards on top of the pool table, which was really uncomfortable. It wasn't really packed but it took forever to get our food (an hour). I felt real bad for our server due to her just training and nobody really helping her. The food was cold... The fries weren't as good. When asked to speak with the manager in stead the waiter got security.

This place is awesome not only because my best friends mom is here. But it is Amazing the youth program to help troubled youth is awesome. The environment is super safe for everyone and the presence that is given from the instructor in great and the class is welcoming no judgements.   The instructor is very upbeat and just gives off a feeling of energy. It is great make sure to stop by and get hip!

I fairly enjoy this park. I brought my American Staffordshire Terrier and our Lab mix. The park is a bit small but its a good park.   The park is clean and my main worry is the fact that when we go all the balls that are left over. (Who knows what some horrible people do to them). The other furbabies that come are very playful. Some dogs are aggressive and surprisingly they are really segregated especially when you have a pit sadly.

I love this circle k. Not only because it is so convenient but its always stocked. The staff is friendly and they aren't the kind of staff that just ring up your items but they also ask about your day. The store is typically clean.  The outside area is clean, staff is typically on point about keeping thr out side area clean.  There is an ATM on site, news papers, propane area. Ice inside and outside,  pay phone with a by Sam stop out front.  There is a red box also.

I love this place!   Not only does it feel welcoming, but the food is fresh. It reminds me of Braums in Oklahoma.  The frenchfries are fresh and great. When you bite into a burger it just feels right. I enjoy how great their customer service is. You go inside it's clean and sanitary.   The drive in sometimes takes a while but because the fresh burgers and fries I'm okay with it. I love how in  the drive in they will explain what's all in something and they are promptly on knowing the menus. They greet wheb drive up and also I love to ask what their favorite malt is so I can try.

I brought my furbabies to this park. It was great I have an American Staffordshire Terrier and a Lab mix. Topically when I bring our Amstaff people leave because they think he is vicious.   Everyone stayed and played with him. They loved both of them.   I brought my son here also and he road his scooter around the fishing pond. Very safe and the jungle gyms appeared very clean.

I love this place!  I've been coming here ever since my husband and I moved in. They have great prices I love getting the spa pedicures. They take their time and pay close attention to detail.  I dont have a specific favorite person due to ibe tried them all.   Their prices are consistent and they have a great program where you can save and use savings. They do amazing jobs on eye brows. Which I hate pain but I feel okay.  I love their massages when getting a pedicure. The place is clean and is so refreshing.

Great offer on groupon! The staff is very friendly. Although,  we were new we jumped right in to the routine. The instructor was very motivating and helpful. The gym was clean and it was fun it wasn't strict but it mad you push yourself. Great prices and family friendly.

The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because the customer service. When I walked in the woman was talking to someone that was inquiring about a job and she did not know the process about how she could apply I continued to walk around the store after the woman left. I looked around no help no customer service now hello Have a nice day can I help you with anything nothing. I proceeded to start actually shopping and picking up things off the rack to buy I had been there for a good 20 minutes the woman had been talking to another woman that was trying on some jeans she was using her by first name basis and laughing with her and I just kind of got fed up and was like you know what I'm not doing this when I was getting ready to walk out the woman asked me did I have any questions or if I needed any help and I told her know that I had been here for a good 20 minutes and haven't received any type of help so I was good proceeded to walk out. All together in the area is clean and nice it's a beautiful place a beautiful boutique in everything I would go just with work on the customer service.
