Jeannie is the best. One of my favorite gel products is CND. Her application and skill is second to none. She's a highly skilled nail artist and keeps up to date on all the new nail trends. Love her!

There are much better breakfast places in the area. Food is mediocre at best. This is the third time I've been for breakfast. Wait staff is nice enough. Ordered corn beef has and poached eggs. The hash was blackend (burnt) and the poached eggs were hard poached. The place wasn't busy at all. Not impressed.

Theresa is a true artist. I've seen lash extensions on others, and her skill is second to none. @Lash is a "Full Service" Salon that is on the cutting edge. A definite "HIDDEN GEM" in the heart of Scottsdale.

Mandy is wonderful! Had my first (of many to come) today. Her care during application is excellent. The product is fabulous.

Yummy! Had the larger cheese burger and it was delish. Hot, juicy and fresh. Staff is passionate about their product and so friendly and happy. Ordering is super easy and we were served quickly. Cute patio area to enjoy a nice glass of vino. I am only able to eat grass fed beef and this is my new favorite spot. Will definitely be coming back. And....the frozen custard was fabulous!
