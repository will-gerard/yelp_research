After a previous unpleasant dining experience at Satori Sushi, I decided to give it another try.  After we were seated, the waiter basically whizzed by our table and was not very attentive.  It took him a good 10 minutes before he came back to take our order.  (He was though, very attentive with the 3 gals dining at the table next to us.)  When he did get to us, I asked what was included in the sashimi combo and he replied "I don't know, it's chef's choice."  I asked if he could find out, and he was rude and acted as if he was inconvenienced by having to go ask the chef.  When he got behind the sushi bar and asked, this is what he said "Chef, what's on the sashimi combo so that they (and he nodded his head towards our table) can tell me what the DON'T want to eat?"  Obviously, I could hear this and witnessed with my own eyes just how rude he was to paying customers.  We got up and walked out and he had the audacity to look confused!  Obviously, I won't be going back there again.

I've been with Dr. Sielicki over 15 years and she is fabulous.  Her staff is also always so friendly and are ready to help with any issues or concerns.  I always feel very comfortable there, and I am always impressed by the outstanding professionalism I experience when going for an appointment.  I would highly recommend Sonoran Dental Design.

We have eaten here several times before, and when we started, the food was good, and a good value.  Every time after that, it has consistently gotten worse.  The pieces of sushi keep getting smaller and smaller, and the food keeps tasting worse and worse.  We went there for dinner tonight and the food was terrible.  My husband ordered a salmon hand roll, and instead of putting actual pieces of salmon in it, there was some type of salmon paste.  It looked like sawdust, and tasted terrible.  The beef teriyaki was terrible.  My husband said that he would not even feed it to our dog.  The pieces of fish on the nigiri sushi were so thinly sliced that it was mostly rice.  The fried zucchini was not as crispy as it could have been, and the seaweed salad was warm.  For $21 a person, it was a total rip off for dismal food.  We will never go back there again.  We have been disappointed too many times by mediocre food that is not worth the price they charge, even if it is AYCE.  Go to a happy hour somewhere else with decent food.  Don't waste your money here.

My husband has not stopped complaining since we left over an hour ago.  We ordered wings as an appetizer, which is pretty much the only thing you can eat there.  My husband got the fish tacos, in which the fish was nonexistent.  It was all batter and taco filler.  I got the beef sliders and the beef was cut very thin, so it was mostly bread.  It also needed salt as it was pretty bland.  The horseradish sauce was more like a butter and was too heavy for my taste.  There was not enough horseradish flavor in it at all.  Our waitress was very attentive and did a great job taking care of us, but the food was terrible.  Now I remember why we've never been back after going to the downtown Phoenix location 10 years ago.  My husband remarked that all the smart people were at the bar drinking because the food isn't worth it.  We won't be going back to this location or any other one.
