I am not sure what the fuss is about this place. I will give it points for a unique interior; I mean it is not very often that you can eat a plate of spaghetti while sitting in a giant velvet throne, but the food is very ho hum. I grabbed dinner there with some friends before heading to a concert in Glendale, the concert was after work, and it was a good middle meeting place.   For being an Italian restaurant, I thought the menu was really limited....nothing really unique, mostly just pasta and sauce combinations. The salad that you get with your meal is just the cheapo iceberg, which is not even worth eating.   Also, they advertise that they can make any of their pastas gluten-free, which excited my sister, but when she tried to order, she was informed that the only gluten-free sauce they have is the tomato, so she went with just a salad, once again, chock full of that icky iceberg lettuce.   There is way better Italian food out there people!

I decided to grab a sandwich to take back to my office after running some errands in the Colonnade shopping center, since I parked near the Sub Factory, I figured it was worth a try.  The inside is quaint and not very fancy, but they have a huge menu!  They have hot subs, cold subs, croissant sandwiches, wraps and paninis.  I decided to get the Mesquite Smoked Turkey special, which was turkey, bacon, provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo and Santa Fee sauce served hot.  My sandwich was ready in a flash and still hot by the time I got back to my office.  I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this was.  The bread was crusty on the outside, but soft on the inside, and the Santa Fe sauce really made it delicious.  They had lots of other good looking sandwiches, so now that I work in the area, I am sure that I will be back when Subway just won't cut it!

I met some friends here for lunch, the menu is a weird mosh of Italian, Mexican and American food....it is almost like they can't figure out what kind of restaurant they want to be.   I ordered the cheese enchiladas which was probably the wrong choice at a non-Mexican restaurant, but I just wasn't feeling anything else. The two people who were with me got their food, and I was still waiting, and waiting and waiting. Finally the waitress came over and asked if anyone had been here to talk to me...isn't that her job? She said that they gave my dish to someone else by accident, so they are making me a "fresh" plate.   My enchiladas finally arrive, and look like they were just slopped on the plate. i take a bite and guess what? They were barely warm! You would think that a "fresh" plate would be served piping hot! I took a few bites, but by now I was over them and late for a meeting.   A waitress that was different than ours brought over our check, which included my enchiladas. I told her what the problem was, but she didn't seem to speak English very well and said she would go ask someone. They did take them off the bill, but that really should have been done automatically since the other people at my table were done with their food before I even got mine!   The decor is odd too, it is like they are trying to be a sports bar, but maybe aren't sure, evidenced by the 6 plasma TVs sitting in the corner still in their boxes!   If I have a say in the matter....I won't be returning to Deemos.

I can't believe being the Mexican food junkie that I am it took me so long to try out El Bravo...I have been missing out!   The restaurant is small, in a nondescript strip center along 7th street and it is no frills, but it is delicious!  The chips are so light and crispy, yet they hold up to the chunky salsa really well.  The salsa is full of big chunks of tomatoes, onions and peppers, all at their peak of freshness.  We ordered a cheese crisp to start, and this one was crispy and loaded with cheese, perfection!  Made even more perfect with a scoop of salsa on top.  I got the green chile beef and bean burro, and I was in love at first bite.  The meat was tender and flavorful with just enough heat and the tortilla was tender and rich.  This was probably one of the best burritos I have ever had and it is making me hungry again just thinking about it!  I know many people complain that you have to pay extra for additional baskets of chips, but the prices are so reasonable to begin with, it really shouldn't matter.

After working in the area for 2 years I finally checked out Stumpy's on the suggestion of a friend, and wow, I was missing out!   The place is small and no frills, but they are churning out some huge sandwiches with quality ingredients and some delicious looking pizza.  While $9.50 including tax, for a sub, drink and chips sounds a bit pricey, the sandwich can easily cover you for 2 meals.  While I waited for my to go order, the slices of pizza I saw coming out of the oven where huge!  They had thin crusts and were piled high with toppings, I almost wanted to change my order....but I guess I will just have to come back another day!

I have driven past this place many times over the years, but it always looked a little scary, and with Someburros nearby, I would just always go there. The other day I knew I would be in the area around dinner time and wanted to see if there was anything new in the area worth checking out....the reviews for Espos were all recent and talking about the awesome green chile (my personal fav) and how they had recently spruced up the place, so I decided to give it a try.  The interior is still very old school Mexico, but it was clean.  The banner outside says something like "We have the BEST green chile" so I definitely had to give that a try, I ordered the Green Chile Cheese Crisp (Quesadilla) and the cheese enchilada plate to go, the food was so cheap, it was like $10 for both!  The food smelled amazing on the long drive home to Scottsdale, and I couldn't wait to try it.  I went with the enchiladas first, many times what disappoints me most about enchiladas is the bland sauce, but this red sauce had a nice bit of heat to it and was really flavorful, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed my $3.85 enchilada plate!  I moved on to the Green Chile Cheese Crisp, my only complaint was that they had not cut it into pieces, it was just a giant folded over tortilla, but as soon as I took my first bite all of that was forgotten...it was AMAZING!!  It reminds me of something from my childhood, the beef was so tender and flavorful, it wasn't spicy but it had some heat, I was in heaven!  I didn't get a chance to try any of their refried beans, so that will be on my agenda next time, but I will always have to get something with the Green Chile!  If I lived closer to this place I would definitely be a regular, I will now be skipping Someburros and heading straight to Espos when I am in the area.

The Good Egg should really change its name to the "Mediocre Egg."  The menu looks so good and promising, but then your plate arrives and it is just "meh."  I don't know why I keep going back here (wait, yes I do, it is really close to my house...duh!) when I am disappointed every single time.  The restaurant has been there forever, and it shows in the tired decor.  I think the egg pictures are quite funny, but the rest of the restaurant is straight out of 1988 and could use some refreshing.    Today I ordered one of the X-ceptional Skillets.  The skillet had potatoes, onions, bell peppers and ham (I said no to the fungus) and was supposed to have melted cheese over the top and my choice of eggs.  The skillet came out, and it just looked sad!!  The chunks of green pepper and onion were clearly just thrown in the pan with cooked potatoes, as they were barely warm and not cooked at all.  Raw onions with breakfast?  Not the way I want to start the day!  My biggest complaint, is the lack of cheese.  Normally, when you order a skillet meal, it is blanketed in cheese (which is the best part in my opinion)....I had to go on a search and rescue mission just to find the cheese in this dish!  I think they had used a whole tablespoon of cheese that they plopped in the very middle and covered up with the scrambled eggs.  Seriously?  What a joke, I think a lactose intolerant person could have eaten this dish and had no reaction!  So I sat there and at raw onions with no cheese and eggs with a weird texture that were five degrees away from being cold, not the breakfast of champions I had imagined.  The best part of the meal was the sourdough toast, it was thick and chewy and perfectly toasted, and they actually put the butter on it for me!  No trying to spread cold butter on hot toast!  In past experiences I have ordered the Sun Devil Scramble and it always seems to be really watery....how does that happen?  In a nutshell (or should I say eggshell)....The Good Egg isn't all that it is cracked up to be!  (I apologize for so many egg references....I just couldn't help myself!)

I have an addiction to Jalapeno Cream Cheese.  There, I admitted it!  I am not sure what it is about this sinful substance, but it keeps drawing me back in again and again.  I have to say that Ajo Al's version is one of the best out there.  I usually get the Beef Flautas with the cream cheese and a side of beans.  It is even tastier to mix some of the cream cheese with the beans!  The pollo fundido is also excellent, of course, it too has the cream cheese!  They do a good job on the classics as well, enchiladas, tacos and I love their salsa too!  Overall, a quality place serving Sonoran style favorites.

I normally am a big fan of VI, they make them some good pie!  We got our pie to go that day, it was yummy, but that was the best part about it!  We got there on a Sunday morning, and encountered a 15 minute wait, no biggie.  No biggie except we could see multiple empty tables, and multiple tables just sitting around with dirty dishes on them.  The one manager dude just kept walking past all the dirtiness like nothing was wrong.  We finally got a table and placed our order.  I got the ultimate skillet, it was overflowing with onions and peppers, I like onions and peppers, but I wanted to taste some other stuff in it too!  The cheese melted on the top had been heated for so long that it got all hard and crusty.  The bacon was crisp, but quite fatty.  The pancakes were okay, but the syrup was really weak.  So moral of the story, go to VI for pie to go....period.

If you like your food spicy, you will like Arriba!  I know it is a chain, but it is a local chain, and they are very consistent!  They have the best spinach enchiladas around....they are amazing!  I also love that they give you bean dip and two different kinds of salsas with your chips.  The menu has pictures of everything, which makes it very hard to choose, but I usually stick to a few of my favorites.  They also have really good lunch deals like Taco Tuesday (99 cent tacos) and Chicken Chimichanga Thursdays (just $1.99).  The food is always hot and fresh, and they have good beans...which is always a benchmark for me!

This place has been around forever, and while I don't ever remember eating here before, my dad assured me that I had. The place is no frills on the outside, but has a quaint charm to it on the inside.  The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.  We got a cheese crisp to start, and it was definitely a good version.  Before we could even finish it our food started coming out of the kitchen.  My sister and I both ordered Combo #10 which included a shredded beef taco and a red or green cheese enchilada, we both chose red. Like a typical Mexican restaurant, our plates came out piping hot with the standard "Don't touch, the plate is very hot" warning from our waiter.  First things first, I took a forkful of beans and held it up, I could see the steam rising from them, I took the bite and was immediately in heaven! These are the beans that I have been searching for!!! They were so creamy and delicious, and had just enough cheddar cheese sprinkled on top....I could have seriously just had a plate of the beans and been happy!  I took a bite of the enchilada, I really liked the enchilada sauce, it had wonderful flavor and there was not too much cheese to where that was all you could taste, it was an excellent enchilada. I then tried the taco; the shell was crisp and filled with the shredded meat, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. It was really good, the meat was not the best shredded beef I have ever had, but all the components together made it a taco that I would order again.  My dad loved the chile relleno con carne, he said it was a good version, and one of the best that he had had recently.  I decided I definitely needed to add La Fonda into my rotation, if only for the beans alone!

My business partner and I had been driving around for 3 hours that morning, and we decided that it was time for lunch. I had remembered seeing this place in the past when I had stopped by the Rubio's that is in the same center, so we decided to check it out. We arrived at around 12:30 and the place was packed...which I generally take as a good sign! We got in line to place our order and looked over the menu. We loved that the menu had pictures of everything...a major bonus!   I decided to try the Beef Shawarma and she got the Gyro. We grabbed a table and waited just a few minutes for them to call our numbers. We both took a bite and loved our meals. I had never had Beef Shawarma, but it was delicious, tender and served with hummus and garlic sauce. I tried the Gyro meat, it was some of the best I have had. Everthing seemed to be very fresh, and the restaurant was clean.  I don't venture to that area too often, but next time I need to, I will try to make it around lunchtime since the menu had many more items that I would like to try!

While this place cannot be considered healthy by any means, if you are need of a good ole' greasy burger fix, this place fits the bill.  My sister just recently discovered this place through a co-worker and has been bugging me to go with her ever since.  I was really surprised at how big the space is inside, tons of seating, a bar area and even an outdoor patio with tables and games!  Although I haven't been since I was a kid, I am guessing this is similar to the Chuckbox, order at the counter, and then they call out your number.  After you grab your burger, you head over to a giant wooden wagon that serves as the condiment bar.  It is stocked with tomatoes, ketchup, lettuce, pickles, hot peppers, mustard, mayo...you name it.  One side of it serves as a salad bar, so I guess if you went there and just got salad you consider it a healthy restaurant.  Their main gig is burgers, and they come in a variety of sizes from 1/3 lb all the up to a full pound and with a variety of toppings.  They also have some chicken sandwiches and even a grilled fish sandwich on the menu!  The burger was pretty good, the cheese was melted and I liked that I got to top it off just the way I like it.  But I have to say my favorite thing was the Fried Zucchini and Onion Rings.  I know most things are good once they are fried, but the batter on these was just right, and they were crisp, not a soggy mess.  I scored myself some ranch dressing off of the salad bar and I was in deep fried heaven.  So, while I won't be visiting here every week, every now and then I can see it hitting the spot.

I found this place while driving up 7th Avenue.  I stopped in and picked up some food.  I came back again the next day!  This place is super divey, but serves up excellent versions of the classic Sonoran style Mexican food that I love so much....and it is incredibly cheap!  I was surprised to see the cheap prices, and even more surprised that the food turned out to be so delicious!  The crispy beef tacos and cheese enchiladas are excellent versions of the classics.  Their green chile beef is divine, but I do wish they had green enchilada sauce in addition to the red version, but nonetheless, it was still tasty!  Oh, and the cheese crisp....so crispy, so cheesy, and held up all the way back to my office!  But one of my true barometers of good Mexican food is the beans...and let me just say....their beans are everything beans should be; creamy, salty and rich....they are AMAZING!  This is not very far from my office...which may cause me to visit more frequently than I should....but at these prices...the only thing that will suffer is my waistline!

I first tried out Mi Patio about 2 years ago and thought that it was just okay.  But my sister wanted to go have lunch today, and with both of us having a craving for Mexican, Mi Patio is in the middle of our 2 offices so I decided to give it a try again.  Thank goodness for second chances...because Mi Patio delivered!  I found the restaurant to be much cleaner than on my initial visit, and the service was so attentive and so quick.  We never had our glasses less than half full without getting a refill, and the chips were flowing!  The chips were really good, served warm they were light and crispy!  Our food seriously came out less than 5 minutes after ordering, which is such a bonus when you are on your lunch hour.  My sister had the spinach enchiladas and loved them.  I went with a beef taco and green chile beef burro.  The taco was excellent, the shell was crispy and not greasy and the beef had a ton of flavor.  I usually measure a restaurant based on their green chile and their beans, and these were both excellent.  The green chile had tender beef and the sauce had some nice spicy elements to it.  The beans were creamy and covered in cheese, just the way I like them!  I will definitely be going back to Mi Patio, the food is good and the people that work there are so hospitable, it makes for a wonderful dining experience.

My sister wanted to meet for lunch one day last week, and told me to pick a place.  I was tired of all the usual spots, so after a quick search on Yelp, I came across La Pinata.  It is in an old strip mall on 19th Ave., but once you walk in, it is this funky, little retro Mexican restaurant with a cool vibe.  The menu is huge, with lots of the classic Sonoran style dishes us Arizonans love!  The chips and salsa were great; the chips were warm and the salsa was fresh and chunky with a touch of heat!  We tried the beans and they were really good, they didn't beat the beans at Los Compadres, but nonetheless, they were tasty.  We tried the cheese and the spinach enchiladas and both were really good, served piping hot!  We decided that we would definitely return to sample some more items on the vast menu!  They even had my all time favorite, the Mary Lou on the menu, and I just have to try that at some point!

How is it that I am the first to review this place? It is a classic, and it is always busy! Go figure?   Julio's Too is the take-out version of it's big brother Julio G's, the menus are the same but the prices are sure not! Julio's Too is very reasonably priced, and offers the same quality of food as the main restaurant. The lunch specials are amazing, with most being around just $6.00!! They too have my beloved Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and I usually end up ordering a half-pint to take home with me.   I love the flautas, green chile burritos, shredded beef tacos and the mini chimis. Their salsa is very addicting, I just wish that they gave you more with your take-out order. The only flaw I find with Julio's Too is the beans. I am a bean connoisseur, and their beans just do not quite stack up to the others out there. They are just lacking that special something. When I have a craving for Mexican food, I usually lean towards Julio's because it is close to home, fast and cheap, but sometimes when I am really in the mood for some good beans, I have to go somewhere else with better beans!   But even with the questionable beans, I am still there quite frequently.

Oh Mary Lou how I love you!  I still don't know how this dish came to be called the Mary Lou, but I don't care what it is called...it is sooo good!  A cheese quesadilla covered in a delicious green beef chile sauce....it is so indulgent, but it is worth it!  They sure don't skimp on the cheese here and the beef in the chile is so tender it just melts in your mouth.  Add on a side of their delicious beans and you have yourself a tasty meal.  Be prepared to share (or just have lots of leftovers) cause this thing is huge!  The best part is during happy hour you can get it for half price!  The tacos, enchiladas and beans are also top notch here.  I would also have to say the plain old cheese crisp is one of the best ones out there, always crispy and not skimpy on the cheese!  I just wish they had a parking space for take-out orders!

I had to meet a client on Saturday morning at 9 am (and was not happy about it), but I turned a negative into a positive by meeting  my friend here for breakfast at 9:30.  Such a cute little place with tons of stuff to look at, it definitely is not boring at the General Store!  They serve down home country favorites, the perfect breakfast foods if you ask me!  I had the Belgian waffles with scrambled eggs and bacon.  The waffle was good, but it could have been better if they let it cook a few more minutes to get it crispy on the outside, but the eggs were perfect and the bacon was amazing!  It was nice and crispy and the slices were thick, the best of both worlds!  I am not in this area often around breakfast, but if I do happen to find myself up this direction again, I would not hesitate to head over to the General Store!

The name Pedro's always seems to come up when searching for good Mexican food in Phoenix, but I never quite made it there due to its proximity to where I live and work.  That changed the other night when my friend convinced me to go car shopping with her and we passed it while driving to the dealership.  After a long, frustrating process at the dealership (what car buying experience doesn't fit that category) we were hungry and her baby needed to eat so we wanted to go somewhere close by, so we thought we would give it a try!    It was about 7:30 on a Monday night, and there were about 5 other tables of people that seemed to be regulars.  We weren't sure what to expect from the outside of the building, and its location, but inside was clean with some kitchy decor.  The menu was vast and had all my favorite dishes...it was so hard to choose!  Ultimately I got a combo plate that included a bean tostada, cheese enchilada and a shredded beef flauta with beans (I opted for no rice).  The chips that came out first were delicious, hot, crisp and lightly salted, they were some of the best I have had.  The chunky salsa was good, but a bit on the sweet side, but it was perfect once I mixed in some of the hot sauce.  I really liked how they have you little bowls for your salsa, plates and salsa just don't mix!  The food came out fast and was piping hot....I tested the beans, my benchmark for Mexican food, and they were delicious!  Creamy, salty and rich, they were really good beans!  The enchilada was good, but I did feel the sauce was a bit on the thin side.  The beef in the flauta was delicious, really flavorful, it didn't even need sauce!  My friend had a burrito that she also enjoyed.  Our pit stop at Pedro's was made out of desperation, but we walked away happy and satisfied and considering a return trip.  When we paid the cashier told us that they had been there for 51 years, I hope I make it back before they are there another 51 years!

Yes I know Macayo's is a chain....but I like it...so sue me!  They do a good job with the classics and it is fairly consistent.  I go there for happy hour once a month with a group of people, and we always get great service.  The salsa is addicting and the half price appetizers at happy hour are a great deal!  The mini chimis, the spinach con queso and the cheese crisp are my favs.  I usually just end up getting a cheese crisp with a side of beans...and it comes out to like $6!  I also really like the Baja Shredded Beef Chimi....the meat is really tender and flavorful, and then it is covered in the creamy baja sauce...heaven!    I like to go for lunch during the week too because they have great lunch specials....I am a fan of the Tostada Grande...which is basically a tostada the size of a dinner plate!  So if I am in the mood for a classic standard...Macayo's fits the bill.

The must order item at the Greene House is the Calamari appetizer....it is amazing!!!  The calamari is still tender, and it is in a very light tempura style batter...but they also mix in some thinly sliced pieces of zucchini also in the same batter....it is like getting two awesome appetizers for the price of one!  Their menu is full of very clean, coastal flavors.  I had the fish tacos, and while they didn't quite measure up to my favorite one's at Loco Patron, they were pretty good.  We also had some hummus, which was served with a delicious warm flatbread.  The only negatives I found with the Greene House was the noise level inside and how close the adjoining tables were to us.  I don't know about you, but I don't like hearing about my neighbors trip to the doctor while I am eating!

I work right down the street from YC's, but strangely it took me almost 2 years to actually try it out. I am glad I did! For $8 (including tax!) you can pile your bowl high with meat, veggies and noodles, then you get to play chef and make up your own sauce. I always have leftovers to take home for another meal which is a bonus. The price also includes a drink, won ton chips, soup and rice if you like. The food always appears fresh, which is a major plus. The only downside to this place, is if you hit it during a rush, you might have to wait awhile to get your food cooked....but it is worth the wait!

A group of 7 of us came by at 7 on a Friday night....and the place was empty! I am talking like maybe one or two other tables.   We all ordered some food; tacos, pork green chile, nachos and salads....and I have to say, all were pretty decent and I felt that the pricing was reasonable.  All of the entrees came with a choice of 2 different sides, and they make some great homemade potato chips. I wouldn't describe this place as a Mexican restaurant, but more Southwest. Nobody had any complaints as far as the food went, the service was good, and the atmosphere was nice. So why was the place so empty????

Don't you hate when you get a craving for something and it you can't get it out of your mind until you finally give in to it? Well that is how I found Chen & Wok! I had been thinking about fried rice for days, and yesterday I decided I better just give in and get some instead of driving myself crazy!   Chen & Wok is near my office, and I decided that it would be the place that I would get my fried rice fix. I am always a bit apprehensive going into new places that could be considered questionable from the outside, but it was surprising clean and bright inside. I liked the fact that you just order at the counter...and my food took less than five minutes!   They have some really cheap lunch specials, but none of them were for fried rice, so I had to "splurge" and pay $5.95 for my shrimp fried rice and I also got a side of crab won-tons, which are usually my litmus test for good Chinese.   When I opened the container of rice, it was packed in so tight it came overflowing out of the little carton, it easily could be 3 - 4 meals, so my "splurge" was well worth it! The rice was love at first bite! It was the prefect fried rice with bits of eggs and green onions mixed in with the plump shrimp (and these were big shrimp, not those wimpy salad shrimp), and it wasn't greasy at all...just what I needed to feed my craving! Next I tried the crab puffs, which were shaped like little purses rather than the triangles I usually see, and wow...just wow....they actually had a lot of crab and cream cheese in them...and they were perfectly crisp and oh so tasty when dunked in the sweet and sour sauce! The order came with 8 large puffs for just $3.95....what a steal!   I will definitely be back to try some of their other offerings, while waiting I spied someones Lo Mein which also looked quite tasty...and the prices will be perfect for my after Christmas budget! The only downside I can see so far is the absence of Sesame Chicken on the menu....but I guess I will just be forced to try something new!

Loco Patron has the best seafood tacos in town!!  Whether you go with the grilled mahi or the grilled shrimp, you will not be disappointed!  They are cooked perfectly and then served in warm corn tortillas and dressed with shredded cabbage, cheese and yummy sauce that I can't quite pin down yet.    They have great lunch specials, and the service is always quick.  If you like tostadas, theirs is quite unique, they top them with a creamy avocado sauce...yum!  They also make a mean Chambord Margarita, and the patio is a great place for people watching when the weather is nice.  Of all the Mexican themed bars in Old Town, Loco Patron is my first choice to grab a taco and a margarita!

Yupha's is located in the same plaza as Vincitorio's Restaurant on the Southeast corner of McClintock and Elliot. They used to be located on Rural and Elliot, but have moved to this new location in the past year. The space is big, open and modern; with high ceilings, minimal furniture and modern art, it makes for a very relaxing vibe. We arrived at 6:30 on a Thursday night, and while the place wasn't completely full, most of the tables were occupied. Our waitress came by and took our beverage order, and then gave us some time to look over the menu. And time she gave us, because it seemed like it was 10 minutes before she finally returned; they must have been understaffed that night, because it was just her and one other waitress covering the whole restaurant, so we decided not to get to upset by this.  When she finally did return to take our order, she couldn't have been more pleasant; answering our random questions and suggesting items on the menu. We got the Thai Rolls and some Tom Kha Gai to start.. The rolls were cooked to a nice, golden, crunchy brown, but they were seriously lacking in the veggie department. The plum sauce was good, but they are probably not something that I would recommend for anyone to order.  I absolutely love Tom Kha Gai soup, but almost every Thai restaurant that I go to doesn't offer just a single serving bowl of it, they get all fancy and serve it in these giant silver urns, so I rarely end up ordering it. When I saw that I was able to order just a bowl of the soup, I knew that I had to give this version a try. Well, I have to say, this was the best version I have ever had; it had a touch of heat, mixed with the cool coconut and lime leaves, it was heavenly. My sister had never tried this kind of soup, so I scooped some into a bowl for her and she too thought that it was really good. The flavors were so well balanced, that I really could have eaten a giant urn full of this version!  I got the Pad Thai as my main dish....it was AMAZING!!!  The best pad thai I have had to date; sweet and spicy and just all around great.  I was impressed by how un-greasy it was, my only disappointment with it was that it came with just 2 shrimp!  My sister got the roasted duck, which she loved, they gave her the whole duck!  Our friends ordered the beef green curry, extra hot, and thought that is was good too.  Other than the spotty service, which I am chalking up to a bad night, and the skimpy Thai Rolls....Yupha's is my new favorite Thai place!  I just wish that I lived closer!

We stumbled upon this restaurant as we were picking up our Improv tickets early in the day, the menu looked good, and since we had to come back to the hotel for the show later, we figured it was worth a try!  My family is a bunch of seafood lovers, and we got our fill of seafood at the Oyster Bar!  We started off with the Lobster Bisque (so rich, and HUGE chunks of lobster), steamed clams in white wine broth (AMAZING) and some fresh oysters (SO FRESH!).  We also tried the crab legs, seafood risotto (swimming with seafood) and the scallops.  We loved everything, and felt that we really found a hidden gem in Vegas because you don't normally think of Harrah's as a dining mecca!  The prices were very reasonable compared to some of the high end dining options in Vegas...so I will be back next time I am in town!

I am not a huge Italian food fan, while I enjoy some good ole spaghetti every now and then, when given the choice, you are more likely to find me munching on some chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  But with that being said, when I do get a sudden craving for Italian, Nick's is my number one choice.  I really like the quaint atmosphere....but it is the food that keeps me coming back.  I hadn't been to Nick's in probably over a year, but it is by my parent's house, so we went for a quick dinner the other night.  They always have really enticing specials, like Seafood Risotto or Manicotti.  The menu is HUGE, spanning from pasta, to filled pastas , chicken and veal dishes and even pizza.  They make a good pizza, and I especially adore their gnocchi in the vodka sauce, but my favorite thing to get is the Chicken Parmesan.  This version is not breaded at all; it is just sauteed and then topped with an amazing red sauce and mozzarella cheese.  It is not what you would expect, but it is delicious!  You get your choice of either a side of pasta or vegetables, I usually get the sauteed veggies because they are so good; a nice combination of broccoli, cauliflower, squash and carrots.  They are cooked perfect and even better when dipped in the extra sauce.  Oh, I almost forgot, they also give you this delicious focaccia bread and olive oil for dipping when you sit down, it is so fresh it just melts in your mouth!  So if you are willing to pass on the all you can eat salad at the Olive Garden....you should give Nick's a try!

I have been going to Allure for the past 5 years and I have always left happy.  I am just a pedi girl myself, and they do a really good job at the callus removal ($5 up-charge) and the sea salt ($5 up-charge).  I usually just get one or the other, depending on my mood.  They have a big selection of nail polish, always with the most current OPI colors on hand.  I will say that some of the technicians are better than others (Nancy is the best!), but isn't that how it is at most places?  My favorite part is the massage, and some of the technicians seems to do a pretty weak job, but you can always ask for more pressure.  I do wish that their massage chairs were a little bit higher end, but overall, I love going to Allure for my pedi's.  Especially since unlike many other nail salons, they let you add your tip on to your credit card slip!

I live no where near a Some Burros....and it is probably a good thing...because I would go there way too often!  They are quick, cheap and have some of the best beans out there.  I also have major cravings for the Boracho Burro, which is a green chile beef burro smothered with more sauce and topped with sour cream and guacamole.    I love this place so much I sometimes make up excuses to go to Chandler Fashion Center just so I can eat here!  I sometimes grab takeout if I am in the area for work and bring it back to my office.  They lose a star for not giving you free chips with take-out orders...but other than that...for "fast food" they are excellent!

After opening all our gifts and eating a big Christmas lunch the family decided they wanted some dinner.  Well, we didn't have much left in the way of leftovers, and since we were at my mom's, there wasn't much to chose from otherwise in the fridge (she is a minimalist when it comes to food).  My dad had been having a hankering for some fried rice for the past few weeks, which worked out since it seems the only restaurants that are open on Christmas are Chinese!  Nee House is near my folks, so we called up and placed an order to go.  We were told that it would be 45 minutes to an hour until it was ready...yikes!  My dad and my sister left to go pick it up after about 40 minutes.....and they were gone for a really, really long time!  I guess the place was a madhouse, and if you wanted a table you had to wait in a line for a table!  They sat at the bar and waited...and finally after sitting there about 45 minutes they finally got the food (note to self: never try to order Chinese food on Christmas again!).  When they got home we were all hoping that the food would make up for the wait....and well, it did!  We got the hot & sour soup as well as the War Wonton, both were excellent, although the hot & sour could have used a bit more heat.  The house fried rice was awesome, cooked perfectly, with lots of meat and it wasn't greasy at all, which is very unusual for fried rice.  We also got mu shu pork (this was the best I have ever had) and some sesame chicken.  It was breaded, but it wasn't greasy at all, and the sauce was just sweet enough, but not overpowering.  We had ordered some crab puffs, and they were good, but they had forgotten to give us the dipping sauce, which would have made them that much better.  Overall, except for the long wait, we found Nee house to be really good.  My dad brought home a menu for us to look at, and it has one of the most expansive menus I have ever seen at a Chinese restaurant, including a lot of seafood dishes.  My dad was happy to have gotten his fried rice fix...and I have a feeling he will be going back again soon.

I was craving some Asian food for lunch the other day so I searched Yelp to find a place to grab some food. Ichi Bowl had lots of great reviews and wasn't too far from my office so I decided to to give it a whirl. I am not a big fan of terriyaki, so I usually don't frequent places like this, but when I saw that they had Bulgogi on the menu, I just had to check it out!   I became obsessed with Bulgogi a couple of summer's ago at place in Coronado, CA, and have been on a mission to find something comparable here. I know that there are a few Korean BBQ places around town, but I am never near them around a meal time.   Ichi Bowl is in a random center on 19th Ave. & Camelback, but is very clean inside. And the prices are really cheap! I got the Bulgogi Combo which came with my choice of side (I chose pot stickers) and a beverage for around $7!   I got my food to go, but they do have a lot of seating for dining in. Upon first bite, I was so happy, the Bulgogi was so good, and so tender! You never know when dealing with these fast-casual places about quality, but the meat was top-notch with a delicious flavor. The pot stickers were average, but they were not supposed to be the main event anyway.   They menu is quite large compared to say a Samurai Sam's, so I will definitely be back to try out some of the other yummy looking dishes!

I really needed some new glasses, so I headed over to Eyemasters on a Saturday morning. I was helped right away by Kenny, he was so helpful. I told him what I was looking for, he found a pair that I liked in just one try and he recommended upgrading to a better lens based on my prescription. My glasses were ready the same day and the best part...I can actually see out of them! (Don't worry folks, I only wear my glasses around the house) It was so frustrating not being able to see clearly without tipping my glasses down and looking out the bottom of them. Why had no one ever mentioned that my prescription didn't work well with cheap plastic lenses before?   And the best part...they were having a sale that day where I got both the frames AND the lenses for 50% off!    Thanks to Kenny & Eyemasters I now have glasses that I can actually wear out of the house and not be a danger to society!

Since I started at my new office in November, I have been exploring all the new restaurants in my area.  When I realized that Sylvia's was close by, I decided to try it out one day.  I had not been to Sylvia's in about 8 years, and that experience was take-out that had to survive all the way back to Tempe (but it did!).  So I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  The first thing I noticed was that it is no longer an order at the counter restaurant, it is full-service.  I was a bit bummed about that, because at lunch, I would much rather grab food and go, but I guess I would just have to deal.  I got the green chile beef burro lunch special, beans only...and OMG it was AMAZING!  The beef was tender, the sauce was thick and the flavor was just right.  The burrito was huge, so I had leftovers that made up my dinner!  They also have excellent chips and salsa, with both corn and flour tortilla chips....the flour ones are so good!  The salsa is thick and chunky, and the hot sauce has just enough bite.  I have been to Sylvia's a handful of times over the last couple of month's, and my only gripe is that when you order take-out, you don't get chips and salsa...how rude!

When Sprinkles first opened, I tried them, and just didn't get all the fuss!?!?  Fast forward to last month, and well, I am a Sprinkles lover! Maybe I just got a bad one the first time, dry cake....too sweet frosting, maybe it was the flavor...red velvet...usually my favorite, but whatever it was, I was not impressed.  But I have been more than impressed by the simple chocolate with vanilla frosting...moist cake, just the right amount of frosting...always perfect!  The prefect accompaniment to a cold glass of milk!    I will say that I do think they are quite on the pricey side, not so much if just getting one for yourself, but I placed an order for 100 cupcakes about a month ago...and no bulk discount...it was $330...so I am glad that I wasn't paying that bill!  Another bonus is that Sprinkles is next to Yogurtland if you are in the mood to really indulge!

This is based on Brunch only!   For Mother's Day, we were going to a show at the Herberger and wanted to eat before it started at 1:00. I checked out Yelp for some suggestions on places to go and was happy to hear that Switch was not going to be having one of the Prix Fixe Brunches that my mother despises...direct quote from her...."People just don't need that much food!" I was also happy to find that they would take reservations, unlike Local Breeze, so I booked us a table at 11.   The restaurant has a cool vibe inside, kind of dark, but not too dark and the tables aren't too close together! On this day you could order off of the brunch or lunch menu, but we all ended up going for brunch.   My dad and sister got the eggs benedict....both are obsessed with this dish and get it everywhere we go....and they both LOVED it! I had the breakfast galette...don't you just love that word?....and it was amazing! Flaky pastry, sausage, cheese and eggs with some potatoes on the side...it made me really want to come back and check out the lunch versions! My mom had the crust less quiche with the mornay sauce and loved it as well....it was so huge she couldn't even finish it!   We all really enjoyed our meals, the service was excellent and we even got done early enough to check out some shops before the show!   The rest of the family has since been back for lunch and were just as happy with their meals....looks like I need to make a field trip soon!

My sister and I were going to a move at Desert Ridge yesterday but wanted to grab some lunch first, we are Mexican food junkies, and since the only option at Desert Ridge was Rubio's, we decided to head a bit further North and go to Jalapenos.   While I don't get here very often, I always am happy when I do. First off, the chips are awesome. The give you a mixed basket of corn and flour tortilla chips. Now I like tortilla chips in every shape and form, but the flour tortilla chips are a rarity, and when I see them, I pounce! They are so rich, they melt in your mouth, and are heavenly with the fresh, chunky salsa.   I have had many things here, enchiladas, tacos, Mexican pizza, all of which are very good. I would really recommend the shredded beef, it is very moist and flavorful. I decided to try the spinach enchiladas yesterday, to see how they compared to my favorite ones at Arribas. I have to say, they were very different than the ones at Arribas, but they were very good. First off, they use a flour tortilla instead of corn, and they fill it with spinach and cheese, then cover them in read sauce with a dollop of their spinach con queso on top and sprinkled with sliced almonds. It is a very unique enchilada...and very yummy.   The chips are what keep calling me back to here....but the rest of the food never disappoints either!

One word: EXPENSIVE   I was with a friend of mine who had gotten engaged recently, and we were checking out the bridal store next door. We decided to get a bite to eat and there was a big banner advertising that they won some sort of best new restaurant award, so we decided to give it a try.   I am not a regular tea drinker, but since it was their speciality, I gave it a whirl. It was okay, just tasted like tea, but it was $3.50! The menu was the same way, I think all the sandwiches were about $12...who do they think they are?! To top it off, the food took forever! Were were there at about 2:30 and there was only 1 other table, but the food took over 20 minutes.   The food was decent flavor wise, but we really felt like it was overpriced. Next time I want some iced tea, I will just stick to Starbucks!

I can't believe I have lived near Little Chicago for over 5 years and just tried it....I was really missing out!  I have driven past it numerous times, but it is located in a run down strip mall, so I never thought to stop.  But my friends Karen & Kyle had been telling me how good it was, we even tried to order it one day with them, but it was on Memorial Day or something so they were closed.  Well last night I got it in my head that I just had to have some pizza, I hadn't ordered pizza delivery in over 2 years, but then I remembered about Little Chicago!  They not only have pizza, but also hot and cold subs and some pasta dishes.  I went with a Hawaiian style pizza and a side of friend zucchini.  Wow, I was blown away, the pizza was thin, crisp and had just the right ratio of sauce to cheese (I am a light on the sauce kind of girl).  The crust had a really nice flavor, everything melded together so well, I was hooked!  Then I tried the zucchini, and oh my goodness, some of the best fried zucchini ever!  They were cut thick and had a well seasoned coating, they were so good dunked in some of the cool ranch that came on the side.  I think my Little Chicago experience is going to be the first of many!

I took my second visit to Ranch House Grille today for brunch, and I think it was even better than I remembered! I brought two rookies with my, and they both thought that the homey interior made the place so cute and loved the home-style theme of the menu.   The service is wonderful, everyone that works there is so friendly and always have a smile on their face. The coffee is really good, and they are very good about keeping your cup full.   I again had the Light Chicken Fried Steak Breakfast (it is funny that they call it light, because the only light part is that it comes with one egg and a half order of the hashbrowns) but it makes you feel good when ordering! They are known for their Chicken Fried Steak here, and for good reason, it is delicious!! It is nice and tender, with a well seasoned crispy coating and smothered in a peppery white gravy. My two companions had never had Chicken Fried Steak before (which I find hard to believe because I think every elementary school cafeteria had it on the menu!), and they both were pleasantly surprised when they took their tastes. I also upgraded to biscuits and gravy instead of toast, but I could barely make it through half of a biscuit!! They give you two large biscuits and a bowl of their delicious gravy, my mom always makes biscuits and gravy Christmas morning, and while very different from my mom's version, this was very good!   My two companions both had the Eggs Benedict that was the special today. One of them in particular makes it a habit to try Eggs Benedict at every restaurant in town, and she declared this to be an excellent version. She said that the hollandaise was really good, which can make or break the overall dish!   The three of us really enjoyed our meal, and I am thinking we will definitely be back again! They are well known for their Pork Chile Verde, which I have yet to try, but I always seem to get drawn to the Chicken Fried Steak....but maybe next time!

I have been here twice now...and I was completely underwhelmed both times.  The first time the service was terrible, even though there were only a few tables occupied at the restaurant.  On my second visit I was with a group and we were having a 3 course menu.  We started with the duck tacos, and I was very excited about these, but when they came out, they were smothered in enchilada sauce.  A taco is supposed to be a food that you can pick up with your hands and eat, these needed a fork.  The sauce was very overpowering, so the duck flavor was hidden.  For my entree, I chose the Chicken Enchiladas....when they came out, I thought I was being punked, they looked just like the duck tacos, only bigger.  I took a bite, and they tasted just like the duck tacos too!   The same sauce was used, and once again, it masked the flavor of the filling.  Our table was very confused as to why these two dishes were exactly the same yet, one was called a taco and the other an enchilada.  The chips and salsa were decent, as was the Mexican Lime Tart, but I will probably only return if it is for some sort of group event...this is not somewhere I would chose to go on my own.

I don't give out 5 star reviews very easily, but when I go somewhere multiple times and it is always consistent, I think it is deserving.  Ling & Louie's is best described as Asian fusion, I mean there is meatloaf on the menu for goodness sakes!  But they do an excellent job modernizing some of the classics, and it is never greasy!  The orange chicken and crispy spinach is divine, the walnut shrimp so tasty, and I love the fact that they use filet for the beef in all their dishes!  It is always cooked so perfectly and the meat is so tender it just melts in your mouth!  They do a great job on appetizers too, potstickers, sushi and the soups are all excellent, especially the chicken and rice, it has just a hint of spice.  Their drink menu has lots of fun and fruity drinks too, but if you are looking for something nonalcoholic, try the fresh squeezed limeade....it is soooo good!

I had never had frozen custard until Culver's came to town....but I am a convert!  It is so much creamier than ice cream, and when you add in some delicious mix-ins for one of their concrete mixers, it is like a Blizzard on steroids!  I love how they have different flavors of the day, so far I have tried the S'Mores (outstanding) and the Really Reese's (chocolate custard with Reese's - a chocolate lover's dream).  I have eaten the food a couple of times, the burgers are pretty good, but not quite an In N Out Burger.  I do like that the menu is quite big, try the cheese curds, something you don't see very often in AZ, but don't make a trip to Culver's without getting some custard!

I know a lot of people have less than stellar things to say about Top Shelf....but they have the best salsa around!  I started taking my sister and her roommate there, and they literally eat bowls of the stuff!  It is so fresh tasting, with just enough heat to keep you coming back for more!  I also love their Green Chile Beef, it is some of the best around.  The meat is so tender and there is a good amount of heat going on with it as well.  For those watching their waistlines, they even have a Lite & Healthy Menu with nutrition facts...how many Mexican restaurants offer that?  While I have never seen the place packed by any means....the food is always consistently good....so you people are missing out!

The Salted Butter Caramel ice cream is the reason I go....I don't need to try anything else....because it is perfect. Rich, creamy, sweet and salty.....mmmmm.   The shop is adorable, although located in a somewhat odd location....it is a tad pricier than Baskin Robbins....but it is so worth it!   The owners are so nice, we happened to go by the day they were closing for their Bon Appetite photo shoot so they were closed, but when the owner saw our sad faces outside, they kindly let us in so we could get a scoop!

After visiting Downtown Vegas and the Outlet Mall, it was 2:00 pm and we needed to grab a quick lunch.  We stumbled upon BLT Burger and were happy to find that 1) there was no wait for a table and 2) that they had the NFL playoffs shown on tv's throughout the restaurant!  The menu is basically just a bunch of unique burgers, wings, sides and milkshakes.  My mom and I decided to share the lamb burger, which was topped with tzatki sauce and fresh fixings.  It was cooked perfectly, nice and pink in the middle, and was a fun spin.  My dad tried the slider trio; he ordered them medium rare and they were practically mooing still!  He thought that they were the best sliders he had ever had, and they really do cook to order!  We also tried the chicken wings, and the onion rings (yummy), but our favorite part had to be the Malibu Barbie Milkshake!  It was under the "Spiked" Milkeshake section and had Malibu Rum in it....yummy!  Next time I am in Vegas looking for a mid-priced meal (burgers were around $12 with no side), I will go back to BLT Burger for sure.  Funny side note, after we ate, my mom and my sister went to go and  see the white tigers....only to find out, the restaurant is now located where the White Tigers used to be kept!  They moved them into the Dolphin Habitat and now you have to pay to go and see them...boo!

I haven't tried the Carne Asada here yet (but I know I will be back to do so) but all I can say is BEST BEAN & CHEESE BURRITO EVER!!!  After reading some reviews on yelp I decided to go and pick up lunch at America's.  The parking was a bit tricky to figure out at first, and I wouldn't recommend going after you get your car washed or if it is raining because it is just a dusty, dirt lot; but once I got inside and got my burrito, all was forgotten.  They advertise that they don't use any lard in their beans...and well, lard is usually what makes the beans so creamy and delicious; so I was intrigued.  Well upon my first bite, I was not missing the lard at all!  The tortilla was so fresh and delicious, and the beans, oh the beans, were creamy and had just the right amount of melted Monterrey jack cheese mixed in with them.  I was in heaven...and for only $3.25....this is definitely a budget friendly and waistline friendly meal!    P.S. I only ate half of the burrito to start with, and then ate the other half later cold....it was almost even better cold!  I will be back...and next time...I will try to force myself to try the carne asada!

After a couple of visits to Metro.....I can without a doubt say that I am a fan!  The food is always delicious and the service is excellent!  I first went to Metro in search of beingets, which are excellent and much better than Grand Lux Cafe's, but i fell in love with all the other savory dishes they have to offer.  The French onion soup is amazing, but you must try the Moules & Frites (Mussels and Fries)....they are sensational....and the portion is enormous!  They give you this herbed mayo as a dipping sauce for the fries...and with the hot crunchy fries...it is awesome.  Last time I tried the duck, also a another winner.  It is breaded in a panko crust and served with spaetzle!  The good German girl in me really loved the spaetzle!  During the cooler months, they have a great patio with lots of people viewing opportunities.  With all of the recent closures of the restaurants in the South Bridge center....let's hope that Metro sticks around!

I love this place...it could be considered a hidden gem...but it is always busy so it must not be hidden that well.  The space was originally a Taste of Chicago, but when the new owners took it over, they turned it into a Middle Eastern restaurant....but they still serve the hot dogs too!  They make the best gyros here, they warm pitas are always filled to the brim with the gyro meat, and their tzatki sauce is awesome!  The combo with fries and drink is just right for a quick lunch.  I have also had their falafel, which I really liked, they serve it in a wrap bread instead of a pita and smother it with tahini, lettuce and tomatoes!  I have gotten a few friends hooked on this place as well, and my friend Paul always has a hard time deciding between the gyro and a hot dog because surprisingly, they do both really well!

I really wish that I lived closer to one of the Crackers locations, because their breakfast menu rocks! After a field trip to IKEA with my mom and sister we decided to grab a bite to eat, I knew that Crackers had recently opened nearby, so we stopped by. The inside is very cute, feels like you are in someones country home. The menu has a huge variety of breakfast dishes, sandwiches, salads and soups. On weekends, they serve breakfast all day!   I got the Carnitas breakfast skillet, and let me just say, they seriously have some of the best carnitas in town, no joke! The pork was so tender; covered with jack cheese on a bed of potatoes, heaven! My sister got the BLT, and they were not skimpy on the bacon! I have had some of their soups before, and let's just say, the Cream of Spinach & Artichoke is like heaven in a bowl! So rich, and creamy, it is like eating dip without the chips!   They are only open until 2:00, but it is great spot to grab a bite to eat for breakfast or lunch!

I noticed this place a few weeks ago, and we decided to give it a try on Saturday night after a movie.  The space is very clean and the service was SUPER FAST!  We order crab rangoons (awesome), some sushi and the Pad Thai to share.  The sushi was very fresh, and of good quality, and the menu was quite extensive with classic rolls and specialty rolls as well.  I was with my sister and she doesn't like spicy food, so we ordered the Pad Thai mild.  It was prepared well, but I wouldn't exactly call it a traditional Pad Thai.  My sister really liked it, and compared it to a mix between a Pad Thai and a Lo Mein, she said the leftovers were even better.  Overall, we liked the quaintness of the restaurant and thought the food was fresh and tasty.  The prices are very reasonable, the Pad Thai came with both chicken and shrimp and was a huge portion for only $8!  Our total bill was only $29 for the crab rangoons, 2 sushi rolls and the Pad Thai!

I am not normally a sandwich kind of girl, but when I get the craving for a sandwich, Silver Mine is the place I go!  I first had Silver Mine back in my ASU days, we couldn't believe that we could get delivery until 3:00 am for something other than pizza, so we were hooked!  The bread is what really makes the sandwiches so good, it is way better than Subways or Blimpies, it soft on the inside and bit crispy on the outside!  The meats and cheeses that they use are really fresh, and they have sprouts!  They also have really good broccoli cheese soup and an array of hot sandwiches too!  They staff is really nice, and even though this location is not near ASU they still will deliver to my house until 3:00 am!

I haven't actually been inside Luci's, but we had lunch brought in to our office from here so I have had the food.  To start with, I wasn't very impressed by the menu, it was really small, and not very exciting to say the least.  I ended up just getting the tomato soup because it was a cold day and I figured it would warm me up.  Well the soup started out good, it was like a creamy tomato, but after a few more bites I just couldn't handle it anymore....there was way too much pepper....it made it almost inedible!  If they had backed off on the pepper it would have been good, but it was too overwhelming.  Also, they messed up quite a few of our orders, making for some unhappy people.  I think we all decided that we wouldn't be ordering from them again, and I will probably never see the inside because of our experience.

Atmosphere: TOO LOUD!!  Food: Blah  Service: Iffy  Overall Experience: Not Likely to return   I went to dinner here with my friend Jess. We were seated halfway in the kitchen area...no joke!! There were kids running around like they owned the place, and we found out, they sorta do....they were the owners kids. What kind of restaurant owner lets their kids run wild through a restaurant on a Friday night???   We didn't have anyone come over and see us until we had been seated for over 5 minutes, which considering where our table was, we found to be kinda funny. The food was very blah, no flavor! I had a carnitas quesadilla and the only flavor that I could taste was the poblano peppers. My friend had shrimp tacos, she said that the shrimp was overcooked and lacked any sort of flavor.   It was not a very pleasant experience, even not counting the food. The restaurant had music blasting the entire time, like it was some kind of club or something. Which I thought was funny because just about every table had kids or people over the age of 60 at it, definitely not people that enjoy loud music at a meal! The restaurant has 2 bar areas, which is kind of odd, especially for a place located in such a family friendly area. They really are trying to be more of a club I think, which is fine, but maybe they should act like a restaurant until like 9....then crank up the music!

I've been to Brio for both dinner and happy hour, and enjoyed both experiences.  The happy hour tasting menu has a bunch of items for just $2.95!  We had the burger, margharita flatbread, shrimp and eggplant and the steak bruschetta....all were really good and decent sized portions.  But make sure to get there early to snag a table, it is first come, first serve seating in the bar area and only goes until 6 pm!  The only thing that I have had a Brio so far that I would not suggest is the lobster bisque.  I absolutely adore lobster bisque, but this version was so thick...you almost had to chew it!  Other than the bisque, the food has been perfect, seafood risotto, Gorgonzola lamb chops....all excellent.  And if you still have room for dessert...you must try the caramel creme brulee....it is amazing!

I was driving back to my office from an appointment in the West Valley this morning, and I was thinking to myself how I really wanted some Thai food for lunch. I was thinking of picking up something at Thai House or Swaddee, but before I could make up my mind, I saw the sign...My Thai...I figured I would give it a go!   The restaurant is very clean and nice inside, with mostly booth seating. There is a large granite bar on one side. I placed my order to go and had a less than 10 minute wait for my food.   I ordered the lunch #3, the Beef Panang Curry, which was served with rice, a chicken spring roll and a side salad. The curry was the best panang curry I have ever had. It was smooth and creamy, and had just enough heat to keep you coming back for more. I was most impressed with the beef, it was so tender, it almost melted in your mouth....and this was all after a 20 minute drive back to my office!   The menu is well priced and I will definitely go back. I just wish it was closer to the area that I live in, but now I will have to schedule all my West Valley appointments near lunchtime!

I was in the area today for a meeting, and when lunch time came upon us, we found Tang's and decided to give it a try.  I was expecting a typical greasy, Chinese experience, but what I got was so much better.  Tang's is much like a Pei Wei, you choose the dish that you want, the type of protein, the type of rice and it is all done at the counter.  The inside is sleek and very clean, and they have one TV hanging on the wall that was tuned into Sportscenter (bonus points there).  Our food was out in a flash, and it looked divine.  My dining companion got the Chinese Chicken salad and said it was the best one she had every had.  They used a combination of different leafy lettuces, including spinach, so it felt very hearty.  It was  lightly dressed with an Asian vinaigrette and some fried won ton chips.  I opted for the orange chicken with brown rice, and I was happy to find that they don't up-charge you for brown rice like many places do.  My dish had chicken, carrots and snow peas all in a sweet & spicy orange sauce, it was excellent.  The best part was that instead of giant chunks of chicken, the chicken was cut into thin slices, making it easier to eat.  The brown rice was cooked perfectly, and was very fluffy.  We both commented as to how much we really liked Tang's, and if I am in the area around a mealtime again, I would surely go back.  As for the complaints about pricing I have seen on here, the prices are no different than Pei Wei and maybe even a bit less. (P.S. Pei Wei doesn't have "lunch specials" either)  The portions were quite large, neither of us could even finish, and the quality made it worth it.  My meal was only $8.01 including tax, and I am going to get a second meal out of it!

With the yogurt craze being in full effect, I have tried yogurt at a lot of different places, but it is Yogurt Land that I keep going back to.  It could be partly because this location is the closest yogurt place to my house since Ice Tango closed, or it could be that they are the cheapest in town (only 30 cents an ounce....in Scottsdale), but truly I think it is the yogurt.  They always have a good selection of the tart and fruity vs. the rich and creamy flavors.  I love to get peanut butter and chocolate and load it with peanut butter cups....mmmm.  The red velvet is also yummy, and the Irish Cream they had around St. Patty's day was amazing!  Plus, those pink and green spoons are just too cute!

I've been to Panchero's, and I probably won't go back.  If I ever find myself in that center again, I will be at either Jersey Mike's, Starbucks or Yogurtland!  The flavor of the food was decent.....but they were so stingy on everything that it pissed me off before I even got a chance to taste the food!  Get this...they measure out the cheese in this little scoop....are you kidding me!?!?!  It was probably an ounce of cheese, which if you are like me, is not nearly enough cheese to go around.  Also, when I said that I didn't want the rice, just beans, I still got the same amount of beans that a person who ordered rice got....beans are like the cheapest food on the planet....don't be so stingy!  The carnitas was pretty tasty, but I just felt like I was being so jipped as far as the value and the portions went that in order for me to return...a mass destruction of all the Rubio's, Chipotle's and Baja Fresh's would have to occur...and even then...I would probably still pick taco bell....you just can't beat 89 cent bean burritos!

I had jury duty today, so I was in the downtown area. Lucky for me, my sister happens to work downtown and was able to meet me during my lunch break. Unlucky for me, we decided to try out a place one of her coworkers recommended, and it was less than exciting.   First of all, the menu is all over the place, they call themselves a Mexican grill (although they are more similar to a Filiberto's), but then they have a whole menu of deli sandwiches, not tortas, but deli sandwiches like BLT's. They also have chicken wings??? We wanted Mexican food, so we went with the shrimp tacos and the carnita taco special. Both came with 3 tacos, rice and beans, and at $8 a plate, I wouldn't really call this a good deal, especially since chips and salsa were an additional $1.99! My sister's shrimp tacos were just that, shrimp in tortillas....no toppings...no sauce....no flavor! My tacos were unappealing at first sight. I love carnitas, but I like the shredded kind, these were little chunks of pork, but upon first glance, I saw more chunks of fat than pork.....gag! These were topped with some chopped onion and cilantro, but I couldn't even bring myself to taste them. At that moment I was wishing that I had ordered the nachos, even though they use a processed cheese sauce rather than shredded cheese (why oh why?!). I did eat the beans, which were actaully quite good, they were creamy and not greasy. I didn't try the rice, but my sister said it was good; simply just white rice with peas and some seasoning.   I ended up ordering a cheese quesadilla, because I knew I needed to eat something more than beans before heading back to jury duty, and it is was a pretty good; but it is not like a tortilla plus cheese takes much skill!   I think this place needs to figure out what they want their identity to be....then tweak a few things on the menu.

I saw the sign go up on the building about a month ago while driving to work and I did a little happy dance!  Half Price Books was opening a new store!  I love going to Half Price books, they almost always have what I am looking for, and like the name, they are half off of the retail price!  They have a huge selection and the store is organized so well that it makes finding what you are looking for a breeze.  The store is always clean and the staff is friendly, and when you are done with your books, just bring them back, get the cash and buy more books!

So have you heard the news? They have an oven that cooks food at 1000 degrees, which means that food gets cooked faster! WRONG!   I am not sure if they are still trying to iron out the kinks, but on a Tuesday at lunch, we waited 40 minutes for our Medium-Rare burgers. That's right...it took 40 minutes to throw the meat in the oven for about 1 minute per side. What the cooks in the back were doing during the other 39 minutes I am not sure....maybe a smoke break? The other thing we found to be ironic about the long wait is that they only have 3 salads, 3 burgers, a chicken sandwich and fries on the menu....nothing too complicated.....were they confused back there?   The owners were running around the restaurant talking to people, but our server made herself pretty hard to find. Coming by just once between taking our order and the 40 minute wait. When we did get our food, it was dropped off by one of the owners who apologized for it taking so long, that was nice, but couldn't you have comped us some fries as this point?   We got both the duck fat fries and the herb fries. The herb fries had good flavor, but they were really soggy. I think they may have cooked them in the first 10 minutes of getting our order, and then they sat for 30 minutes! I also thought that the serving size was quite small for the $4 price tag. I was expecting great things from the duck fat fries, but I was quite underwhelmed. They were basically wedges of potatoes that had been roasted in the oven and garnished with shaved Parmesan. They weren't soggy like the other ones, but I wouldn't really call them fries either. The burgers were cooked as requested, to medium-rare, and the buns were nice and soft. The meat was good, but it fell apart really easily, making for a very messy burger.   I checked out the restroom as well, which are two unisex single user stalls. They are sleek like the rest of the restaurants interior, but they have one MAJOR flaw....no toilet paper roll holders! They just have rolls of toilet paper sitting on the back of the toilet....GROSS!!   I probably won't go out of my way to make it back to The Grind, there are just too many other burger places out there right now and they don't have nearly enough variety to eat there on a regular basis. I know that In-N-Out gets away with the concept, but at $1.50 per burger that is acceptable, not at the $10 a la carte price tag at The Grind.

A friend of mine had her nursing school graduation party here.....and she happens to be good friends with the sous chef.....so we go to try out almost the entire appetizer menu!   We were seated out on the upstairs patio, which was nice to be away from the big crowds, but was really, really far away from the restrooms! As the West sun began to set, it got a little hot, but then they put down the shades and the problem was solved!   The food just kept rolling out of the kitchen, my favorites were the crispy rock shrimp which had a kick to them, the mini pigs in blanket and the spinach artichoke dip. The pigs in the blanket were just your basic preparation, but how many places can you order these at a restaurant, and who doesn't dig pork and puff pastry? The spinach dip was creamy and delicious, but the chips could have been a bit better quality. We also sampled the cheese plate, all three kinds of sliders and the chicken lollipops.   We were stuffed at this point, but then came the platters of mini cheesecakes and carrot cakes....mmmm.   This is a cool new place in Old Town to hang out.....I will be back.

I was in charge of "babysitting" my dad on a recent Friday night when my mom was out of town, I don't mind because it usually means I can score a free meal out of the deal, and this day was no exception. When I got the call to go eat, my dad wanted me to pick a place, Pomo is near my house and I had yet to try it, and my dad's last meal on earth would be pizza, so I thought it was a good choice.   I got there at about 6:30 on a Friday night and the place was packed, but I was told I could be seated on the patio right away with a heater, so I opted to do so. Let me just say, that was one of my best decisions. The restaurant seating is very close together and with the high ceilings, it is very LOUD! I was at a table on the nice, quiet patio, near the door and the sound from just opening and closing the door was obnoxious, I don't think I would have even been able to have a conversation with my dad if we were inside, so my advice is to sit on the patio!   Our server, Cricket, was very informative and walked us through the menu. While the menu isn't' that big, it does have quite a few items that are not normally on menus, so she was happy to explain. We both ordered pizzas, I can't remember the names, but I don't think it matters, because what made these pizzas was the crust and the cheese....and those come on everything! The oven cooks the pizza in just 90 seconds, and you are left with a crisp, chewy crust that is just divine! The mozzarella's freshness shines through, and the tomato sauce is just right. We both really liked our pizzas, and sadly had no room for dessert.   I would definitely return to Pomo, but it will have to be when the weather allows for outdoor seating....otherwise, I will just have to stick to take-out! The owner Stefano, came over and chatted with us, it is always nice to see the owner in their restaurant, it really made us feel welcome, a true gem!

When one of my coworkers told my that Yogurtology had finally opened, I promptly went there for lunch the following day!   The inside is very start and sleek, mostly decorated in black and white...in my mind, yogurt is a happy experience....so they need to add to some color!   I liked the variety of flavors that they had, many that I have not seen at the other yogurt places, like Oatmeal Cookie & Cake Batter! The topping bar was fully stocked with the usual plus some unique choices....baklava anyone?   I got cake batter and chocolate, topped with some chocolaty toppings, it was really good, the yogurt was creamy, but compared to the price at my Yogurtland, it was a bit pricey. But it is nice to know that there is a yogurt place nearby my office with the heat of summer on our doorsteps.....it has to have less calories than those addicting frozen custards at Culver's!

After my experience at The Grind yesterday, I wasn't so sure I could handle another burger place today, but my coworkers wanted to check it out so I went along for the ride. I am so glad that I did!   The space is bright, cheery and airy, and on a nice day the patio is perfect setting to eat a meal. While not overflowing with options, the menu did at least have more choices than The Grind. I was excited to see a turkey burger, veggie burger and seared ahi burger alongside the beef choices.   We decided to start with some fries, which do all come a la carte, but they were really good! My favorite were the Zucchini fries, not I might be biased just because I love zucchini, but they were so good! They weren't really all that crispy, but the coating was seasoned right and they had some homemade ranch on the side for dipping. The sweet potato fries were also really good, sliced really thin and served with a yogurt dipping sauce that gave them a Middle Eastern feel. The regular fries were also really tasty, sprinkled with herbs and Parmesan cheese and served with a truffle aioli!   I ordered the Turkey burger with pepper jack cheese, avocado, lettuce and mayo. I had been wanting a turkey burger since last week, so I had high hopes for this, and well, my expectations were not only met but exceeded! The turkey was juicy, seasoned well and the combination of the cheese and the generous amount of avocado made it just perfect! They make the buns fresh with a combination of white and wheat flour, and wow, they are so fresh and delicious!   The others in my group had the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple burger, both of them really liked them, saying the meat had good flavor and was cooked well. One of the girls had the Chinese chicken salad and also thought that it was really good.   They also have a menu full of milk shakes as well as chocolate cream and banana cream pie! We were stuffed and didn't get to sample any of the sweets, but I will try to on my next visit.   There is a lot of burger competition along Camelback right now, and while a bit on the pricey side ($10) per burger, the freshness and service really make it worthwhile. This is my new favorite burger place!

I took a group of 8 friends here last Friday night and everyone just loved it!  We had a diverse group, including some newbies to Thai cuisine but everyone had something that they enjoyed!  The space is very clean and modern, and the menu is HUGE!!!  They have all the traditional Thai standards, but they also have some items you don't regularly see in most Thai restaurants around town.  I also felt that the prices were very reasonable, with most of the main dishes coming in at under $10!  We ate and ate, and even had some room left for dessert!  We had both the Mango with Sticky Rice and the Fried Bananas dipped in honey...mmm!    The service was excellent, the waitress even gave us all our own checks...and then we find out it was her first night on the job!  The owner came over and talked with us a bit, such a nice man.  Thai Cafe has officially earned a spot in my Thai restaurant rotation!

I was visiting a friend who lives right by here last Friday night, and we decided that we must give Zoyo a try so that we could compare it to Yogurtland, Mojo, etc.    The space is nice and open, and they even installed garage style doors so that when the weather is nice the entire store has an indoor/outdoor type of feel.  They had about 8 different flavors, varying from the tart to cake batter.  The cake batter was really good, as was the chocolate.  The topping bar has a huge selection, including some things that I haven't seen at the other yogurt places around town.  The thing that really sets them apart is they also have a case full of chocolate dipped confections and cakes from Tammie Coe!    I don't make it down to that side of town very often....but next time I do, I will definitely stop by Zoyo!

Oh my goodness...a 30 minute wait at  restaurant on a Friday night...that hasn't happened in a while...it must be a good sign!   I haven't had to wait at a restaurant in forever, but RigaTony's was very accommodating and would bring around samples of fresh pizza to keep you from keeling over from hunger!  Once we were seated, our waiter brought over samples of the house Chianti...what a nice touch...we had gotten free pizza and free wine and hadn't ordered a thing yet!  The menu is not huge, but has a lot of the traditional Italian favorites.  We ordered the fried zucchini to start, because my sister is currently obsessed with it!.  Before we got our zucchini, we were brought a huge bowl of salad and warm bread.  The salad was a mix of lettuces, onion, olives, peppercini's and salami in a really nice dressing.  I am not usually a salad eater, but I really liked this one, and even had seconds!  The girls said that the bread was really good, especially when dipped in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar mixture.  The zucchini came out and it was a huge plate of zucchini strips served with a side of basil ranch.  The strips were seasoned just perfectly, and weren't greasy at all, and the basil ranch was a nice change from the norm.  By this point, we were starting to get full, and our entrees hadn't even arrived yet!  Our entrees arrived and they were all huge!  I got the cannelloni, filled with veal, spinach and cheese; they were some of the best I have ever had.  I have previously had some very, very dry cannelloni, but that was not the case with these.  They were served with a side of spaghetti, which I thought was a bit funny, but it actually worked really well together.  The others had cheese ravioli in pink sauce (she raved), spaghetti and meatballs and the RigaTony pasta with sausage.  We all really enjoyed our dishes....and we all had leftovers to take home!  And when I reheated my cannelloni, it was almost even better the next day!  This is currently my favorite Italian place, so much better than VinciTorio's around the corner....and I will be visiting them the next time a craving for Italian food strikes!

The donuts here are amazing....so fresh and tender they melt in your mouth!  I love the Crumb Cake donut, the old fashioned and the buttermilk bars.  The buttermilk bars are literally 3 inches thick....the best I have ever had!  The only reason I am knocking off a star is because the last 2 times that I have been there, they have been out of at least one of the donuts I wanted....but other than that....they are my new preferred donut shop!

Finally got a chance to try this on a hot summer night, and it hit the spot. The flavor choices were quite fun, I got the one with Long Island Iced Tea and Butterscotch....it was yummy...and you could actually taste the booze! The Red Velvet with Bourbon and the Jack Daniels and Chocolate were also tasty. This is a fun treat, and even the nonalcoholic flavors look good!   But while wandering around Old Town enjoying my ice cream, I couldn't help but wonder, if I took it with me in my car to go home....could I be arrested for drinking and driving?

With football season just around the corner, I am so happy to have Blue 32 open in my neighborhood! (Now I have no reason to ever step in Zipp's again, I definitely won't miss the smell of dirty rags and the crappy food!)   I decided to check it out on Saturday for lunch, I thought that I should try to preview it before it becomes packed during football season. Blue 32 is an upscale sports bar, the inside is crisp and clean and there are TONS of flat-screen TVs all over the place! The menu is huge....so many options and many of them unique that you don't see on a regular sports bar menu.   We started with a basket of onion rings, and wow, yummy! They batter was light, but they had added a touch of heat to the batter, that made them perfect for dunking in cool, creamy ranch dressing!   I ordered the Shrimp & Bacon Quesadilla off of the appetizer section, which I though was a nice change from the standard chicken quesadilla (which they do have for traditionalists). The quesadilla was huge, filled with shrimp, bacon and cheese and served with guacamole and sour cream, it was amazing and big enough that I got to bring home leftovers!   My friends tried the BBQ Chicken Flatbread and the classic BLT. They both really liked their dishes, and like the quesadilla, both portions were big and required take home boxes!   This is my new go to place, I can't wait to try out more of the menu and watch 4 football games at once!

I went and checked out this theater last Saturday night and was pleasantly surprised! I remember going to the Harkins that was there as a kid, and it seemed fine, but that was before the days of stadium style seating. Picture Show has added the stadium seating and has really nice black, leather chairs that lean back quite a bit. The theaters are small, but I would call them more boutique size, as the screen is still plenty big and with a nice, clear picture.   The popcorn was decent, but like all movie theaters, the concessions are very overpriced....it was $10 for a medium popcorn and 2 medium drinks, and let's just say the medium drink was about the size of a free water cup at McDonalds! Although, I do think it would be fairly easy to just stop by the food court first and then bring your food into the theater....so I am giving them some points for that.   Movies are $9 which I think is comparable to Harkins and AMC, and they do have all the new releases when they come out, so it is not a discount theater by any means. It also wasn't crowed, which gives them big points in my book...I hate being squished in like sardines!   I hope this sticks around, especially because there aren't really any other theater options in the immediate area.

Sometimes I just want an omelet.  And sometimes it is at lunch time during the middle of the week when the only options to fulfill this craving would be going to Denny's or IHOP.  Lucky for me my office is near Joe's Diner and they serve breakfast all day!  I convinced one of my co-worker's to join me for a mid-week brunch and off we went to Joe's.  If you blink, you might miss it, and even then you might think you are at the wrong place because it looks like a car repair shop.  But inside is a quintessential 50's style diner complete with black and white checkered floors!  We got there a bit before noon and there were only 2 other tables with people, but that soon changed and the place started to fill up.  We both ordered omelets with potatoes and I got a single pancake on the side.  My omelet was delicious, fluffy and filled with ham, peppers, cheese, green chilies and tomatoes with a side of sour cream...and it was huge!  The side of potatoes were delicious, I am normally a hashbrown girl, but these cubed potatoes were seasoned so well that they went perfect with the eggs.  The pancake was one of the best pancakes I have ever had, it was a bit crisp around the edges and when covered in syrup it was melt in your mouth good!  The servers are very pleasant and attentive and the food comes out quick.  I would think that on the weekend this place gets pretty packed....so I am glad that I can get my omelet fix here during the week with no wait!

I am a chocoholic....but I don't get the chocolate cupcakes here....it is all about the Salted Caramel Vanilla!  I tried the chocolate, nothing that would bring me back for round two (even with the peanut butter frosting), but when I tried the Salted Caramel Vanilla I was a goner!  The cake is so moist and the vanilla frosting, drizzle of caramel and the sprinkling of sea salt take this cupcake to another level!  YUM YUM YUM!  Please don't tell chocolate that I am cheating on him!

I remember seeing the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives that featured Los Taquitos, but never got the urge to drive all the way down to Ahwatukee to try it out, so when the sign went up in the center near my office I was excited!  The interior is really modern and they have a huge bar, which from what I hear, is very different from the original location, but they are trying to step it up a notch!  You still order at the counter and get a number, which I love, and take out doesn't take that long either.  I have tried the chicken quesadilla and the carne asada quesadilla and loved them both.  The green salsa goes great with the chicken quesadilla, which was a helpful tip from one of the owners.  One of the best parts of the quesadilla experience here is that it is not greasy at all!  They use a white cheese (jack I think) and use just enough to make it cheesy without overwhelming it with grease, plus they cut them up in cute little squares that makes it great for sharing.  They also have good guacamole.  The only downside so far is the beans....they are a bit on the runny side....but with so many other options at reasonable prices...I guess I can overlook this!

I met a few friends for happy hour and dinner here, and was pleasantly surprised by my experience. I like Chinese food, but I have never been a big fan of P.F. Changs because there as never been a dish there that stood out to me and made me want to go back, so I was interested to see what Jimmy Woo's had to offer.   The happy hour is a great deal, all of their specialty cocktails are 1/2 price, so they come in around $4 and are unique and quite tasty. They have a pretty large menu of food items too on happy hour, from egg rolls and dumplings to even some rice and noodle dishes! The crab Rangoon's were pretty good, but I think they may have used imitation crab. I thought the pork egg rolls tasted better and were a better value at only $1.5 for 2 large rolls. We also ordered dinner and tried the Kung Pao chicken (nice heat, and not greasy), Orange Peel chicken (tasty but a little dry, and not nearly as good as Bamboo Clubs) and the Honey Seared Shrimp (this was by far the best version of these I have ever had, the shrimp were huge and the sauce was just perfect).   The menu has a lot of other items that I would be interested in trying and the vibe inside is nice. I think this is probably my new go to Chinese place in Old Town. And another bonus, they even have their own parking lot!

I'm really conflicted about what rating to give....the service was 5 star but the food was only 3 stars for me, while I tend to give more weight to food, I will be nice and just average it out to a 4 star review.  I went here last night for my birthday dinner and picked this restaurant because I was craving some Shrimp & Grits, and it was listed on the menu.  I ordered them and out came a cast iron skillet of shrimp and sausage in a tomato sauce, with some grits in a bowl on the side...not what I was expecting!  The tomato sauce was really bland and gave no flavor whatsoever to the shrimp.  The grits were nice and creamy, but nothing special enough to save the dish.  I fished out the sausage, which had a nice heat to it, and just ate that.  The cheddar bacon biscuits on the side were quite good, and I was glad I had them.  I also had the Tomato Ricotta salad to start...I don't think the lettuce was washed very well because about half of the bites tasted like dirt, but I enjoyed the fresh ricotta.  My family enjoyed their food more than me, but I was blown away by the staff's service and concern that I had not gotten enough to eat.  They wanted to bring me another dish and when I declined they even offered to package me up a meal to go, A+ for service!  I declined and opted to order dessert...it was my birthday after all...and when the bill came they had removed both my entrée and the dessert!  I will say the white sangria was excellent and the mac & cheese with pancetta was delicious...I would be willing to give Beckett's another try...just not when I am in the mood for shrimp & grits!

After trying Yogurtopia, it is definitely on the bottom of my list of yogurt places, there are just too many other options in the same area that are much better.   I had taken a friend to lunch at Blue 32 for their birthday, and they wanted to get yogurt afterwords for dessert. We decided to try this place since it was next door, and I was not impressed. The inside is nice, and the flavor options seemed intriguing, but they just didn't compare to other ones that I have had. I love the Oatmeal Cookie at Yogurtology, but the one here tasted so fake. The vanilla also had a really artificial flavor to it.   If you are in the mood for yogurt, go to uSwirl or Yogurtland in the area, and thank me later.

I am so happy the Someburros has finally ventured North and opened a location in Scottsdale....although I really wish it was closer to Old Town where I live, but I will take what I can get!  The Borracho Burro is the best....a must try!   And while you can't drive thru and order, the drive thru pick up window for take out is a nice perk!

I was never one to go to a chiropractor, but in a desperate attempt to get some pain relief one day I went to The Joint, and now I am hooked!  I love that you don't need an appointment, and I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seen.  Dr. Lees is awesome!!!  I don't have a monthly membership because I don't go that often, but I did buy a package and it is a great deal!!  Being in alignment is good for so many reasons health wise, so go see Dr. Lees and get straightened out!

I have never actually been inside, I hope it is better than the sketchy outside, but they produce some darn good tacos!  I was helping friends move and they picked up tacos for us to eat for lunch....the al pastor were my favorite, tender, flavorful and perfect in those warm corn tortillas with a squeeze of lime.  I like the carne asada also, but the pastor were by far the best.  We also got some sort of carne asada Mexican pizza, I was excited to try it, but it didn't really live up to my expectations, I thought it was a bit dry.  I need to venture back and go inside (but only in the daylight) and check out what other treasures they have hiding on their menu.  I have heard the fish tacos are amazing!

I checked this place out for brunch on Sunday with some friends before a show at the Herberger. First impression: the space is funky, cool and inviting, and the booths are really comfortable!   The menu reminded me of the menu at Culinary Dropout; American food with a twist! The brunch menu has few breakfast sandwiches, french toast, and some other egg dishes as well as some of the lunch menu. We started off with the Pretzels and Provolone Fondue....I have had it at Culinary Dropout, and it is just as good....warm and comforting. I wasn't really sure what I wanted to eat, but I ended up going with the bacon, egg, cheese and avocado breakfast sandwich...and YUM...I picked well! I have an issue with eggs lots of times, but these were perfect, made even more perfect by being covered in melted cheese, creamy avocado and crisp bacon on a soft, homemade roll. The breakfast potatoes that came on the side were a nice surprise (they weren't listed on the menu) and cooked until golden and crisp. I wish they offered this sandwich 7 days a week, because I would eat it for lunch or dinner anytime!   My friends had the egg white wrap (which she devoured), the French toast that was served with jelly and cream in the cutest little jar and the fruit salad which was mixed with yogurt. We all really enjoyed our food, and the fun cocktails too, I had The Pink Drink....and it was STRONG! The menu also has a cold bar of oysters, lobsters and many other delicious sounding items.   I think this is a cool place and the food is good, but I don't think I would go if I wasn't already going to be downtown for another event because you have to deal with parking in the garage and all that goes with it, and that is just something us AZ people are not fans of. But with that being said, I need to find something to do downtown so that I can visit again soon!

While I have been a longtime fan of Butterfield's, this new outpost with a similar name is my new favorite because it is closer to my house!  The menu is about the same as Butterfield's, but that is a good thing, because I have never tried something that I didn't like!  Lately I have been a big fan of the Popeye Scramble, with onions, bacon, spinach and jack cheese...it is divine.  The hash browns are crispy and I can never decide between the thick sourdough toast or the melt in your mouth pancakes!  Yesterday the pancakes were the winner, and they were delicious as usual, my favorite pancakes in town!  We did have to wait about 30 mintues on a Sunday morning to be seated, but that is on par with all the other good breakfast places in the area.  But Butter's makes up the time by getting the food out fast!  I spoke to the owner and apparently any new locations that they open are going to be in the Butter's name....but who cares what the name is as long as the food is good!

In the Mexican restaurant hierarchy, Senor Taco falls between a Macayo's and a Filiberto's, so people need to just accept it for what it is.  It is a step up from a berto's and just below Macayo's, but it is cheap, fast and pretty tasty.  They are mostly famous for their shrimp burritos, they are generously filled and full of flavor.  Plus they have lots of great daily specials.  The ingredients are fresh and they offer a nice little salsa bar too.  Don't go in expecting to be blown away, and you just might be pleasantly surprised.

Black Chile is not your standard Sonoran style Mexican food that we Arizonans (including myself) love and use as our benchmark, it is a bit more refined and every bit as delicious.  They have a great happy hour, that includes piles of nachos, cheese crisps with unique toppings (try the chorizo and olive) that even my cheese hating friend likes, guacamole and street style corn.  All are delicious, especially when paired with one of their amazing margaritas, I prefer mine with Chambord, but I hear the Strawberry Jalapeno is killer.  On the dinner side, the enchiladas are tasty as is the red chile burro.  While I am normally a bean fan, at Black Chile it is all about the rice, they call it honey rice or something, and it is by far the best rice I have ever had, even when I go for happy hour I can't resist ordering a side of it!  I love that you can bring a group here big or small and everyone can find something on the menu that they like.  I have just two issues when it comes to Black Chile: 1) They don't have shredded beef, just ground beef (makes it feel like Taco Bell) and 2) Happy Hour is only in the bar area, I think they should take a page from Z'Tejas book and offer it restaurant wide....because that would make me really happy :)

This is probably my favorite cheese steak in town, the meat is tender, the vegetables are crisp and they don't skimp on the cheese (provolone for this girl).  The roll holds up well with all the fillings, but isn't so hard you can't bite it.  I have had many Cheesesteaks, and some of them are so bland and don't taste like anything, but that is not the case here.  I know some have talked about the price, but I just had a half cheese steak with chips and a drink for less than $8 total, which is about the same at other sub places.  I was there late, at 2 pm so it was not busy and the service was quick today, but I have never had a problem with service before.  So get off your high horses and give it another try!

Burgers are one of the hot new food trends, and burger places are popping up all over the place.  Between Five Guys, Smashburger and The Habit, my vote and my money would definitely go to The Habit.  First of all, their prices are so much more reasonable than any of the either places, you can get a burger and fries or onion rings for around $7, while just a burger can be that much or more at Five Guys.  The interior is bright and clean, and the service was fast.  My cheeseburger was juicy and the toppings were fresh, and I am a big fan of their onion rings!  I also like the fact that they have other things on the menu, the shrimp burger looks intriguing!  For a quick lunch that is easy on the wallet, The Habit is a good choice.

Chicken fingers are such a basic concept, but the type of breading makes all the difference.  The fingers here are plump and juicy and the breading is actually light and crunchy, while I wouldn't call them my favorite chicken finger I have ever eaten, I would say they are my favorite fast food chicken finger.  They are much better than KFC or Jack in the Box, and there is something about the simplicity of the menu that I really like.  I love that they have crinkle fries, which in my opinion or the best fry you can get and the Cane's sauce is addictive!  It is cool, creamy with a punch of flavor, and I dip chicken and fries in it equally.  When I get "The Box" I always sub an extra sauce for the coleslaw, which I could care less about but it isn't bad.  The Texas toast is a somewhat odd addition, but no carb lover should turn their nose up at it!  Probably my most favorite thing at Raising Cane's is the lemonade...it is the BEST lemonade I have ever had, much better than Chic-Fil-A's which I sometimes think is sour.  Sometimes chicken strips just sound good, and Raising Cane's satisfies, so give it a try!

We took my dad here for Father's Day dinner, and I walked away stuffed with no room for dessert!  The restaurant is owned by the family that has Wally's, but it the food is much more refined and it is a nicer ambiance.  We had the prosciutto wrapped asparagus and pork belly for appetizers.  I am not usually a fan of asparagus, but when wrapped in prosciutto and drizzled with a honey sauce, I was able to enjoy it.  The pork belly was something I have always heard about on cooking shows, but never tried.  It was about three inches thick and served with caramelized pancetta (pork on pork, love it) a spicy tomato jam and toasted bread.  We weren't quite sure how to eat it, but once we dove in it was pure bliss. The pork was so tender and had a nice smoky flavor to it; paired with the spicy tomato jam it was a culinary experience I will not soon forget.  While I enjoyed the appetizers a lot, my main dish was even better!  I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, and having just been to New Orleans about six months ago, this dish rivaled those that I had down in the South.  The grits were doctored up with cheddar cheese and jalapenos, and were just heavenly, plus the portion was very generous, so there were plenty to share.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly (although a bit on the small side) in a sauce with andouille sausage; the dish got better and better with each bite!  My dad thoroughly enjoyed his rib-eye with blue cheese butter and my mom and sister both loved the seared ahi salad.  My dad told me he has previously tried the short ribs, and they were phenomenal, plus they are also served with the drool worthy grits.  The service was excellent, and the food was divine, I love finding a locally owned restaurant in my neighborhood that is actually good!

I knew SOL was not going to be the my favorite style of Mexican food, but what I didn't know was that their style involved no flavor!  I had read good things about this place so I decided to try it for my birthday dinner last night.  The Watermelon Margarita was quite refreshing, but after that, things just went downhill.  The "chips" that they bring you are whole corn tortillas that have been flash fried and dusted with chili powder. Whatever kind of tortillas they use, makes for some very thick, hard chips, and not very good at all.  The salsa is just hot, no real flavor and the complimentary bean dip is so bland and unappealing.  I guess the "flavor enhancer" tray including hot sauce, lime and salt that they bring to your table should have been the first clue that we were in for an under-seasoned meal.  We ordered the Bacon and Shrimp Guacamole to start, and it was bland, even though it had bacon in it!  Plus you had to eat it with more of those hard tortillas, no bueno.  I got the Grilled Burrito with carnitas and my dad ordered the carnitas platter.  When they set it in front of him, it just looked like a pile of mush...and it didn't taste much better.  He asked our waitress what he was supposed to do with it, if there was a sauce for it, but she said you are just supposed to eat it with the sides.  The pork was the most bland pork I have ever eaten in my life, even when it was mixed in the burrito with guacamole, cheese and beans.  I have no idea how they were able to extract such little flavor out of it, or why, according to our waitress, it is the most popular dish on the menu.  But then again, some mysteries are never solved...like falling in to the Bermuda Triangle.  My mom and my sister had a shrimp salad and shrimp tacos respectively, both of them said they were edible, but not exciting.  I did get some dessert nachos on the house for my birthday; chocolate and regular tortillas deep fried and dusted with cinnamon/sugar and a drizzle of Dulce de leche.  They were actually pretty good...but not good enough for me to come back.  Their seemed to be a decent crowd for a Monday night during the summer....but I am just not sure how long SOL can survive in this Valley of the Sun with so many other, better options for a Mexican Fiesta!

Driving down Scottsdale Road on a Saturday morning we passed the Breakfast Club (which isn't my favorite anyway) and it is packed with people and tons of people waiting for tables.  We arrive at Dottie's and there are about 3 tables on the patio with people and just one other table inside, usually my motto is "No people = no good" but we were hungry and figured it was new so we would give it a try.  The inside is nice and bright, a drastic change from when I was there when it was Bada Boom Pasta Room (another overrated Scottsdale place).  Upon looking at the menu, there wasn't anything that jumped out at me, the menu didn't seem all that interesting and there were not a lot of choices.  Deciding how you wanted your eggs cooked and which breakfast meat you wanted them served with or what fillings you wanted in your omelet were the only decisions to make.  I ordered an omelet and the server suggested I try the homemade buttermilk dill bread as my toast, so I went for that.  My dining companions also go an omelet and one got poached eggs with sausage.  The food came out relatively quickly, which was expected with not many people being in the restaurant.  The omelet was nice and fluffy and it was generously filled with my selections, but that was about the only good part of the plate.  While the thick slices of toast looked tasty, they had no taste whatsoever.  There was no dill, no nothing....I wasn't sure what they wanted it to taste like, but it just tasted crunchy to me.  The breakfast potatoes were even worse!  They gave us a huge portion but they were covered in oil and were not even cooked through all the way, and even though they appeared to be seasoned, they too had no taste.  Our waiter was sort of absentee, just wandering around the restaurant.  He made a few goofs, bringing me a Sprite when I ordered water and bringing my dad their "special" buttermilk dill toast instead of the wheat bread that he asked for, but he was hard to track down so we just went with the flow.  I also felt that the prices were a bit on the high side, with breakfast for 3 coming to over $30 with no beverages ordered.  I am always on the hunt for a new breakfast spot....but Dottie's does not make the list...and after we left and continued down Scottsdale Road, we noticed that the Daily Dose also had a huge group of people waiting....maybe Dottie's is off of their list too.

I have been to Rehab a couple of times, the burger place not the real kind, and each time I have enjoyed my meal and the excellent service.  The owners are always around and will stop by to chat, they really want the experience to be a good one for their customers.  The sweet potato tots are awesome, especially with the special dipping sauce that has some heat to it.  I always get the smaller sized burger, and with all the toppings and the tots, it is more than enough food.  My favorite one is the Hatch Chile Cheeseburger, just enough heat and they always cook them perfect (I like mine medium rare and I am always getting them overcooked!)  The Turkey Burger is also a solid choice with avocado and pepper jack.  And, unlike many of the other burger places, they have other stuff on their menu too, pastas, sandwiches, and salads.  If I need a burger fix in the Old Town area, Rehab is my top choice.

We went here tonight for my sister's birthday dinner and the meal was amazing, I am definitely a fan of Central Bistro!  The space is beautiful inside, but I do think it is bit noisy inside, between the music playing a bit too loudly and the high ceilings, but I the food and service is excellent!  We had the Vichyssoise to start, and the cold soup on a such a hot day was just perfect.  We also had the wood fired artichoke, which was seasoned really nicely and then taken to another dimension when dipped in the aioli dipping sauce.  My sister and I both got the scallop risotto and it was AMAZING!  The scallops were perfectly cooked with a nice sear on the outside, and then the risotto was filled with flavor from the bacon, corn and peas...it was a match made in heaven!  I also thought that the price was really reasonable, at just $18 for 3 large scallops and a huge portion of the risotto.  We had some key lime pie to finish the meal, and it was the perfect ending.  The food will definitely keep me coming back....I need to try their brunch sometime soon!

Fast, Fresh, Friendly, and Frugal; the perfection description for Pellini.  The market for fast-casual Italian food is surely lacking, especially since all the Fazoli's closed (yeah, yeah, I know it was a Fast Food place, but it was a step up), so I was excited to check out Pellini.  We went on a Friday night, and it was not crowded at all, probably just because they had only been open 2 weeks.  But it was nice that it wasn't crowded, we didn't get overwhelmed by all the choices and were able to make our decisions without pressure.  One of the owners, Mark, was extremely nice and walked us through the process, everything there is made fresh from their own recipes, and the quality is excellent.  I tried a "Pellini" which is essentially an Italian burrito.  I went with the chicken Milanese, red sauce, white sauce, noodles, cheese and some spinach, it was excellent!  My sister got a gluten free pasta bowl with the Pesto sauce and chicken, she devoured it!  I love the concept, the flavors are spot on and it is so reasonable, the Pellini and a drink was just around $8!  This place fills a great void in the market and I think it has long term potential!  P.S. If you aren't too full, get a Nutella Pellini....AMAZING!

Capriotti's is my go to place when I am hungry and don't have time to leave the office for lunch, I love that I can order online and in about 15-20 minutes lunch has arrived!  I used to order from Jimmy John's all the time, but they have lost my business to the new kid on the block.  Jimmy John's is so skimpy with their meat, but Capriotti's loads up their sandwiches for a filling lunch.  The Bobbie with pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo is so good, or if I am in a red meat kind of mood, they make a good cheesesteak, not traditional, but still tasty.    Another reason I have moved on from JJ's is that you can only get their brand of chips, which are not that great, and Cap's has most of the standards...I just wish they would carry Cheetos and then they would really be perfect!

There is no sign on the building yet, but the doors are open and the friendly staff at Otro will happily feed you!  I went some co-workers yesterday for lunch, we were one of just two tables, but I don't think that will happen again once word gets out that Otro Cafe is open, and is the sister restaurant to Gallo Blanco, a Phoenix favorite.   The interior is crisp, open and highlights the buildings natural architecture, with exposed beams and brick.  There are a mix of booths and tables and a huge patio out front that will be perfect for sipping margaritas.  After sitting down we were given a huge bowl of chips and two salsas, a red and a green.  The chips were warm and slightly salted, they were on the thick side, but still tasty.  I prefer a thinner, crispier chip, but it is really just personal preference.  The green salsa is bright and tangy, and the milder of the two, while the red one is thicker and robust with chile flavor.  My group went through about 3 bowls of each during our lunch, so they are definitely memorable.  The menu is limited right now, but they plan to double it after things get rolling.  It has a unique blend of modern Mexican dishes along with familiar items, like tacos and guacamole.  We tried the Mexican Paella, which had great flavor, but the chicken was a bit on the dry side.  We also tried the El Pastor tacos and the Tacos el Carbon.  The tacos are served on homemade flour tortillas that just melt in your mouth.  The pastor was very flavorful, and I loved the addition of the pineapple for a bit of sweet, it really elevated the flavor.  The el Carbon tacos were served with a chimichurri sauce that was also flavorful.  We also orderd a small side of guacamole, which for $3 was huge and some of the best I have head, definitely the best value on the menu.  I really enjoyed my meal and can't wait to see the menu expand and grow.  One of my dining companions said that they prefer the tacos at Gallo Blanco, he liked that meat selections better there...but I pointed out that these are sister restaurants and not the same....so they had to change up the menu a bit!  I think Otro Cafe is going to have great success, the food is delicious and it is located in the hot 7th Street corridor...I will definitely be back.

I thought about deducting a star for the problematic parking situation at Little Cleo's, but the overall experience and food were just too good!  The interior is clean, a tiny bit loud, but well lit and the tables are not crowded.  I was dining with a client, who happens to be a seafood distributor, so we tried just about everything...the meal was AMAZING from start to finish!  We were treated to some complimentary frog legs by the kitchen, it was a good move by them, because those will definitely be something that I order on future visits.  I had never had a frog leg before, so I don't have much to compare, but these were crispy, crunch and dressed in a sweet chile sauce, making them finger licking good, they are a don't miss dish there.  We then had oysters, I don't remember the different kinds that we had, but they were all delicious especially when topped with the house made cocktail sauce that had freshly grated horseradish sprinkled on top.  That same cocktail sauce was also served with the cold shrimp appetizer, the boil seasoning was really good, and added nice flavoring to the shrimp.  We also tried the hush puppies, they were nice and moist unlike some that I have experienced that have been dry and crumbly, they had a nice dipping sauce that they were served with, but it was necessary, they were just as good plain!  For my main course I ordered the Cajun Spice Shrimp....wow...this was an amazing dish!!  I think it is their version of Nawlin's BBQ shrimp, which I happen to love, and this dish brought just enough heat, but not enough to overwhelm the flavor.  There was also some corn and red potatoes in the mix, as well as some nice toasty bread to soak up all of the delicious sauce.  It was truly magic on the plate.  I would 100% recommend Little Cleo's to someone looking for their seafood fix in the desert...even if it means having to circle the block 3 times looking for a parking spot because the valet lot is full.

I have been here twice now...and I am sure many more future visits are to come!  The pizza is amazing....the toppings, the cheese, the crust...together it is perfect!  I have had the Carne pizza and the special one night which was a white pizza, with fresh figs and prosciutto...I couldn't stop eating it!  The Bistro Bacon salad is also delicious, the bacon dressing really takes it over the top and you can't go wrong with a Nutella and Banana calzone!    Love the beer selection...including some ciders!  Excellent patio, excellent food, excellent staff...this is a place that you just must check out!
