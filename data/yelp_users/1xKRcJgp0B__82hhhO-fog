I purchased costume and costume items from Barry's Dance Theatre Shop since the 1960''s.  I am a Costume Designer/ Dance Instructor  and  shop for costumes and accessories  from Barry regularly.  I  have confidence in the knowledge and customer service of the staff that I refer  my clients/dancers to their store.The staff is highly knowledgeable and experienced in fitting Dance Shoes.   If I need an item in  short notice  that they do not carry they will order and rush the item so that my needs are met. I highly recommend shopping for Dancewear and Shoes at Barry's.

I loved Robert Black's Vintage Shop!  I fell in love with his Bob Mackey Gown   on display as you walk in the door!!!  His store has a wide selection of upscale vintage clothing.  Robert and the people working in the shop are delightful  creating a fun experience shopping.

I went to Mad Dog Saloon to celebrate Mother's Day with my Daughter.  We each ordered a shot of whiskey.  The woman bartender accepted cash payment from me and later charged my daughter for the same two shots.  A man at the bar also paid cash for three shots for us and himself.  The bartender  took advantage of us by overcharging us.  I called the management and they seemed hesitant to get  involved.  I have been a regular customer but because of the lack of concern from the manager I will not return to this establishment.  I also would recommend people go elsewhere for a drink.

I went on Mother's Day with my Daughter for a drink to celebrate the occation.  We have gone to Mad Dog Saloon several times in the past because we live in the neighborhood. The service is always slow but we usually go just to talk and catch up. On Mother's Day we ordered a drink after sitting at the outside bar for a long time watching the female bartender ignore us.  There were only five other people at the bar.  She placed  our bill in a glass  in front of us.  I paid her cash for both drinks. Later my daughter was asked by the same bartender for her visa card to pay for the same drinks.  I did not notice that my daughter was also paying the bill I just paid.  I assume the bartender put the cash I gave her in her tip jar instead of covering our tab.  I called the manager and he could care less that this happened and was sarcastic to me.  I assume this was the "Special Treatment" stated on the  the Mother's Day Welcome posted on the sign in front of the establishment.    The manager could of refunded us for one payment that we paid.  He did not.  We will not be returning and will spread the word not to give business to this establishment.
