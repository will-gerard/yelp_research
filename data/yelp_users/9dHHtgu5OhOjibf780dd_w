Bar none, Kai is the best restaurant in Arizona, if not one of the best I have ever been. I've had the pleasure to dine here on three occasions, with the last somehow topping my first two unbelievable experiences. Though it will put a nice dent in your wallet, Kai is worth every penny. And then some. This past visit, I had the rare opportunity to try their 13 course dinner with wine pairings.  Kai expertly fuses together Native American and French Cuisines. It is not something you'd expect to work together, but with every dish unveiled, the food ceases to amaze. You'll tend to see the Native American influence with the meats and the ambiance, while the French component can be seen in the flavors and the service.    Even within the first few minutes of dining, Kai manages to impress. Somehow, the greeter welcomed me with, "Good evening Mr. Pachence". I'm not sure how they knew my name before I even said a word. Once I was seated, the staff laid out the napkins in unison and provided the menus. As I've learned from my previous experiences, each menu has a unique hand-painted piece of art. The last two times, the waiter described the artwork along with the underlying story. I was only slightly disappointed that this wasn't enacted this time around, but it only makes sense since my dining excursion was already allotted for about three hours.  It's worth taking the time to call out the exquisite service. I had found out only a month before this past visit that Kai ranked #1 on OpenTable's 2012-2013 list of best service in the States. Had I not read that, I still would have put it at the top of the best service I've ever had from a restaurant. Their top-tier French service includes wait staff that fold your napkins when you leave for the bathroom. They reveal and take away the table's dishes all in unison. They absolutely cater to you, hand and foot. Everything is brought out at the perfect temperature, even the silverware! The forks are either chilled or heated, depending on the dish you receive.  Take for example, my second experience. I was with a group of four. At one point, the staff forgot to bring out a wine pairing with one of the dishes. They were the ones to point out later that a mistake was made, which they made up for by bringing a complimentary appetizer, paired wine, and a free dessert for the table at the end. Now that is service!  The meal itself was nothing less than a piece of art. The food was glittered with both style and substance. Out of the thirteen courses, it's pretty tough to choose the highlights, since everything was so very special. The miniature sous-vide vegetables (4th course), foie gras (5th course), escargot (9th course) and the buffalo tenderloin (11th course) stood out as the best. I've never been a fan of escargot, but the truffle crema and pork belly pieces made the dish so incredibly special that it may have permanently changed my mind on escargot. The buffalo was smokey and tender, with a sweet tinge that that came from the Saguaro blossom syrup.  Across all of the dishes, mushrooms seemed to be the theme of the night with five of the courses highlighted by various types. What is really impressive is that non of the mushroom types were reused throughout the dishes. I left the meal a little overstuffed, but undoubtedly happy. How could I not, after leaving what I would consider as one of top ten meals ever.  Kai is as good as it gets.

This restaurant is located on the corner of Via de Ventura and Hayden, tucked away in a moderate sized strip mall. Zipps has a bunch of other locations throughout the Phoenix area, each of which with a pretty similar look and feel. The interior of the restaurant is your typical sports bar/restaurant. Televisions playing sports and a level of noise you'd come to expect from a bar. I've been to this restaurant 3 times and have had a very similar food experience each time. Two of the times were take-out and once was dine-in. I sat at a booth for the dine-in and let me say, it was less than comfortable. The wooden booth was slightly less comfortable than a park bench. The waitress had a bit of an attitude, but it seemed a little more directed to her work conditions than necesarily our table.  Over the times I've been here, I've had the Buffalo Chicken salad, the Monoco Focaccia and the Greek Chicken Salad. Their dishes are much too salty and many of the things were soggy. The Buffalo Chicken was so soggy it wilted the lettuce. The Focaccia and fries that came with it were soggy as well.  I'm sure Zipps would have been an entirely better experience had I been there with a bunch of friends, tipping back some drinks. In reality, I was there because I was hungry. Each time I've been disappointed by the food, so I would pass unless you're there to watch a sports game and tip back a few.

Going into Second Chance, you should be made aware of a few things to set your expectations. First, anticipate a very large crowd and an even longer line. Second, expect to do some serious digging in order to find the deals. Lastly, don't expect much in the men's section of the store.  It was seriously a mad-house walking into Second Chance at 11am on a Saturday. Imagine Black Friday at a Best Buy or a Walmart. The shoppers had more excess energy I would expect out of a kid who just ate an entire box of Fruit Loops. I enjoy my personal space and really had none of that as they scurried around and got in my way as I mazed through the store.  The line to check out was looped throughout the entire floor layout. It's tough to put a wait to it since I gave up and left, but I would guess at least an hour. I would hope there would be some kind of payoff at the end other than a cart full of clothes. Maybe a good carnival ride?  I'll fully admit that this rating is a little biased. I had been warned of some of these things, but had been told that the deals can be found through some hard work and borderline PI work. I unfortunately am of the wrong gender and therefore only had a small section, at most a tenth of the store targeted to my buying habits. I had trouble finding any clothes that suited my tastes and then when I walked to the shoe section, I was shocked. Every pair seemed as though they had been worn for a year. Have you been to the shoe section in a thrift store? Something like that. No offense to anyone interested in buying a second-hand pair of shoes; it just seemed strange to be in a retail store with items that were so heavily used.  I left disappointed and a little frusterated. Had there been some hidden gems in the men's section, it might have been worth the wait and fending off the rabid crowd.

I'd like to say this is one of Phoenix's best kept secrets, but with almost 350 reviews, I'm the one late to this party! I'm sure I wasn't the first one to have trouble finding the place. I was parked directly in front for what felt like 5 minutes before I realized that the dark door with no sign was the entrance to Dick's. Once inside, the seating was limited to 10-12 bar stools and 4 tables - The other side of the restaurant was closed to a private party. I have no qualms with limited seating, and in this case was worth the 15 minute wait.  Once seated, service was decent enough, however I could tell that they had a lot going on our waiter also doing bartender duty. The menu was extensive with a moderate sized nightly-menu and about a dozen items on their special board. I ordered the Carne Adovada and was able to sample one of the special menu items, the Seafood Trio (I can't recall the exact name).   The last time I had Carne Adovada was over at Carlsbad Tavern in Scottsdale. Comparably, the one at Dick's was far above and beyond. The meat was tender, the spices complimentary and not too overpowering, and the sauce -- well, it was knock-me-off-the-chair spicy. They do forewarn you on the menu of this, so I can't knock any points off for it. It was enjoyable, my stomach just wishes I had gotten the sauce on the side.  The Seafood Trio came with Salmon, Mahi, and Swordfish, each with a different sauce. The Mahi and Salmon were pretty well cooked, although the Swordfish was a little too dry - Which might have had to do more with the quality of the fish than the cooking duration. For me, one of the highlights was an inventive (but certainly not fancy) side dish with creamed corn, asparagus, and brocolini. Off the cusp, it might sound a little off, but the combination of sweetness of the corn worked well with the greener vegetables.  Of the 'New Mexican' restaurants I've been to in the Phoenix area, this is certainly one of the better ones, if not the best. In comparison to the also good Carlsbad Tavern, I would personally recommend Dick's.

Special occasion tasting menus are a dime-a-dozen across the resort restaurants and fine dining establishments across the Phoenix metro area. I hesitate at taking the bait and buying into a $80+ per person dining experience that has in past experiences left me less than satisfied. The problem with the experience is not necessarily the restaurant itself, but the mass produced and sometimes simplified menu that caters to an audience that is typically much larger than the restaurant is accustomed to handle. Case in point: T. Cooks, an otherwise excellent restaurant, left a poor impression due to slow service and cold food back on Valentine's Day 2013.  So when I decided to book a $145 per person Valentine's Day dinner at Binkley's, I had my reservations that it might not hit the high expectations it had set from the hype I've heard about the restaurant and the chef. I thought to myself, my first experience there should probably be on an average night rather than a pre-fab menu experience. I cannot tell you how happy I am to report that I was wrong. It managed to pull off the second best dining experience I've had in Arizona and undoubtedly one of the top-ten meals I've ever had.  Starting with the service, the wait staff was attentive, friendly, and unbelievably accommodating. Another Phoenix area restaurant, Kai at the Wild Horse Sheraton, should be considered to have only marginally better service. To put it into perspective, Kai took the prestigious top honors of best service in the USA last year on Open Table. Binkleu's knocked the service out of the park by employing a huge staff to roll out the meals in perfect timing and included perks that are only part of the finer dining experiences - e.g. replace napkin upon using the restroom, new and highly customized silverware for each course.  Absolutely nothing bad can be said about the unbelievably creative and diverse meal that was served over the next two hours. While the tasting menu listed 6 courses, there ended up being a total of 19 individual rounds including appetizers, amuse-bouches, digestives, and palate cleansers. One element of surprise throughout the courses was the use of molecular gastronomy such as foams and liquid nitrogen, which was very well executed.   From the six main courses, the highlights included a savory and not too overpowering black truffle winter vegetable soup, a delicate scallop on the half-shell with citrus flavored foam, and Wagyu beef prime rib with scalloped potatoes. Stand-out intermediary dishes included an intensely flavored micro-sized sloppy joe sandwich and a flash frozen vegetable medley. Each of the dishes were well sequenced - when a meal includes so many rounds, it is impressive when the meal can tell a story across the meats, vegetables and starches served.  Upon leaving the restaurant, I was satiated and not overstuffed. 19 rounds may seem like overkill, but consider that a majority of the dishes could be eaten in just a couple bites. It allowed a first time Binkley's diner such as myself to try a vast array of the offerings, exemplifying their culinary capabilities. The restaurant catered to every aspect a diner would want for a special occasion and more importantly (for them), I left longing to come back to try the food again.  Rounds: (Main courses marked with asterisk)     1. Fried Chips - Snake skin, dill pickle, bacon, chard, dried soy milk   2. Lamb Consume   3. Miniature sloppy joe   4. Warm soaked prune (curved fork)   5. *Cauliflower carpaccio   6. Flash frozen winter vegetable medley (curved spoons)   7. *Black truffle winter vegetable soup   8. Mango bomb (Japanese spoon)   9. *Scallop on the half shell   10. Tangelo soda   11. *Wagyu beef prime rib   12. Creme Fraiche with carbonated grape   13. *Warm open faced sandwich   14. Cranberry consume   15. Hickory smoked creme brûlée   16. Hibiscus tea - Coffee syphon   17. *Freezing strawberries   18. Macaroon  Note: I missed one round from the above list. It was a flash-fried fish chip towards the beginning of the meal.

Tired of your standard breakfast fare? Daily dose is bit of breakfast with twist, with their menu containing some great healthy alternatives, along with some really interesting and tasty versions of French toast and omelets, among other things.  I am a bit of a Daily Dose regular. Aside from some of the higher end brunches provided at the resorts, Daily Dose offers one of the best breakfast and lunch menus in the Scottsdale area. I've had a good sampling of the different types of items off their menu - You really cannot go wrong with anything listed.   This past visit I tried the Crabby Omelet and the Mediterranean Salad with shrimp. The omelet came with two medium sized crab cakes and an omelet with spinach and tomatoes. The flavors worked quite well together, as the crab was much better suited as separate items than combined with the omelet, like I've had at other places. While the portion size of the omelet plate was generous, the salad was absolutely massive. It was definitely larger than what most people could finish themselves. As only a small complaint, the salad came under-dressed, so I had to request more dressing on the side. I only see this as a small issue because I would much rather a salad to come with less dressing than too much.  Of the other menu items, their burgers and breakfast burrito are also quite delicious. They have a pretty strong list of unique mixed drinks along with non-alcoholic concoctions, which seems to be a trend across the brunch spots in the area. I'm a bit more of a coffee and juice drinker in the morning, but to each their own!  Check this place out when you get the opportunity, as you'll be hard pressed to find a better economical brunch spot! Enjoy!  [This review is based on my visit on July 28, 2013]

Chez Vous is one of those hidden gems that you wouldn't know about unless heard from a friend or in my case, some heavy sluething on Yelp. It can be found towards the center part of the strip mall on the NE corner of Via de Ventura and Scottsdale Rd. It's not really a place you would run across unless on a mission to find it.  I've had the pleasure to stop by Chez Vous twice now. On the first go around, I tried a savory crepe that had chicken and a goat cheese quiche. This time around I tried the Forestiere crepe, which had ham, swiss and mushrooms, and also sampled the vegetarian crepe. I had a fried egg on the Forestiere, which added some extra flair and flavor to the dish. Every dish I've had at Chez Vous has been an enjoyment.  Amazingly enough, the wait staff just so happens to enhance the experience. They are all french speaking with accents and all, and to top thing off, attentive!  This restaurant comes with my recommendations for very selfish reasons. I want them to bring in more business so I can continue eating their awesome food!

Fox Concepts owns a number of restaurants around the Phoenix area and have branched out to adjacent states like California and Colorado. They are known in Phoenix for Zinburger, Sauce, Olive & Ivy, among others.  I'd first like to admit that I've been to True Foods more than I can count. Out of all the Fox Concept restaurants, it is the best of the bunch. Concidering that there are now six locations, it amazingly does not feel commercialized whatsoever. The open kitchen, tall ceilings and cool lighting really adds to the localized feel that I've come to love about the restaurant. The wait staff is incredibly friendly, always bending backwards for their patrons. On a slight downside, expect to wait during peak hours, like Saturday at noon or on a Weekend night. I ended up ordering take-out tonight since the wait was about an hour. I take no points off from having a wait - Means the food is good, right?  Well it turns out the food is good. I'd go as far to say that the food is consistently excellent. The fresh ingredients and natural approach caters towards vegans, organic foodies and anyone else looking for a meal with a straight out of the garden taste.  This past meal, I had the Thai Shrimp Dumplings, the Tuscan Kale salad with Salmon, and the Mediterranean Salad with chicken. Everything was terrific, however the salmon was overcooked. Knowing their staff, it would not have been an issue sending the fish back for another, had I not ordered it as takeout.  While lunch and dinner are excellent, the forté of True Foods is their breakfast. My highest recommendations go to their Quinoa Johnny Cakes and their scramble dishes. I've had most of their breakfast items and let me say, you really can't go wrong with anything. Be sure to try one of their non-alcoholic refreshment drinks, like the Medicine Man. Delicious!  So even with a few miss-hits (overcooked salmon), True Foods is a must try. It is certainly worth the wait if you're there during peak hours, especially if going for brunch!

It's always gratifying to have your expectations exceeded, especially when those expectations are already high. I had run across recommendations for ShinBay on a number of different sites and has for some time now been on my top 10 must-try list. No need to read through the rest of this review. Take the time out of your schedule and give ShinBay a shot.  I took a date to ShinBay over this past weekend for a special occasion. I specified a few details in my Open Table reservation, including a wish for flowers, along with a couple of food requests. While the food requests should be pretty normal for restaurant of this caliber, I was pleasantly surprised that they had purchased a dozen roses for my date, waiting at the table when we arrived!  So I could pretty much write a novel on the food, considering the level of detail that went into the seven-course tasting menu. It felt like much more than seven courses - Some of the dishes included more multiple parts, including the six-components of the second course and the array of nigiri laid out during the sixth course. Highlights of the meal included the savory and sweet foi gras (third course) and the very delicate and surprisingly lightly fried and battered colossal shrimp (fourth course). The sashimi as the first course, clams as the fifth course and the custard desert were all very special and came in as close contenders to my favorites.  Upon departing, the staff wrapped up the flowers to go and also provided an amazingly detailed hand-written note on the different courses from the night. I can only hope that the standard dining experience, sans tasting menu, is just as special as what I experienced. ShinBay comes with my highest recommendation.

Looking for something quick, healthy and fresh in the heart of Old Town? Then this is your spot. Upon entering the ChopShop on any particular evening, you'll find quite a few people still in their workout or yoga clothes. The atmosphere is pretty hip, but not stuffy at all.  The menu includes quite a few health conscious items including salads, protein shakes and acai bowls. OK, the last one is really a dessert disguised as a health food item, but I digress. The breakfast items look appealing, however I have not yet had the opportunity to try them.  Orders are placed at the front counter and the food is then brought to your table. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the American salad with steak, but also had the chance to try the Kale Caesar salad with shrimp. On a previous visit, I had the BBQ Chicken salad. Each of which was done to near perfection. One of the largest issues with salads that come pre-dressed is when they come with too much or too little dressing. These fortunately were coated perfectly. The vegetables were fresh and crunchy and the flavors complemented each other perfectly.  The prices were very reasonable and the amount of food was to my liking. I highly recommend the ChopShop for a visit, whether coming back from a workout or just plain hungry!  [This review is based on my visit on August 14, 2013]
