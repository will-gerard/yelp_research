I've been coming here since not long after I moved to Phoenix (2006?) & I've only ever had 1 complaint. Great Clips is great! ;-)

Got here about 10:45am & all breakfasts looked to have eggs or milk (not really atypical), so I asked for lunch (starts at 11am) & my mom wanted breakfast, & they said no problem! :-)  Mom got Hotstuff & liked it. She also asked to taste the gravy for future reference cuz she likes biscuits & gravy, but not if too much sausage in the gravy. She really liked it :-)  I got the meatloaf sandwich w/o mashed potatoes or gravy since I'm allergic to milk & it was good, also :-)  Service was very good & atmosphere is quaint, cute :-)

This is supposed to be a place of healing & relaxation. Never in my life have I ever been MORE upset & distressed than after having to endure an office visit from so-called "Dr." Pisano!!! This is the "used car salesman" of doctors! I went for a "free" x-ray & consultation. By the time I left the office, I was so upset that I was physically shaking! Pisano traumatized me to the point that I STILL get upset just thinking about that awful experience! :-(  I sat down in his office & he started off asking how much my wellness is worth to me. I explained I didn't make much over minimum wage & he kept pushing & pushing me into signing a contract that he knew I couldn't afford trying to make me feel like I didn't care about my health because I wouldn't sign up for his shady contract that I couldn't afford!  DO NOT GO TO PISANO!!!!! WORST EVER!!!  (The others in the office were ok, but not worth enduring his traumatic tactics! Tho, even the staff wasn't what I'd call "good", as I was given a complimentary massage to make up for another issue they had & when I went, they didn't even have my appt. scheduled!)  Go to a better dr! I recommend Dr. Q! :-)

From start to finish, nothing felt right about my consultation experience here...  I pulled up & the main parking lot has 4 spaces, which seemed pretty strange to me.  I got out of my car & walked in & it was a very dark lobby, which isn't very welcoming. As I walked in, Carly Fiorina greeted me on the big screen TV! (haha she *was* on the TV, but it was part of a report, not to actually greet me! HAHA) I walked by the TV & to the reception desk & the receptionist was nice & seemed competent (best part of my experience). She had everything needed & just had me fill out the paperwork.  I sat down (alone in the lobby) & saw that the TV was tuned into Fox (so-called) News, so that was a huge negative. At least have it on something neutral for patients! CNN for news or something else entirely, but not garbage like that... But that's beside the point...  I got into the exam room & the nurse was really friendly, but, as much as I hate to say it, didn't seem very competent for a medical setting. I had to take my earring out & I'd set it on my paperwork w/ my keys on the counter. We discussed unusual keys & I pointed out my apt key, which is pretty unique, & she picked up my keys & knocked my earring on the floor. Which happens, I suppose, but she didn't even notice it until I got up & got it myself.  Then the Dr came in & he had either wet or clammy hands when he shook my hand. He had my X-ray & asked me why I think I need surgery. Well, a Dr can see that I need my jaws worked on, but he wants me to tell him some mysterious keywords to point toward surgery. I've been dealing w/ this for most of the past 20 years or so, so I shouldn't need to explain to him why I need it. He should look & see that my teeth are being destroyed without surgery!  He eventually decided I don't need surgery & suggested that I have my orthodontist grind down my GOOD teeth, instead, to match the worn teeth! The point of a GOOD dentist, orthodontist, oral surgeon, in MY opinion, is to SAVE your teeth, not DESTROY them further!  Needless to say, I don't care that he didn't deem me worthy of surgery since I wouldn't allow him to do more than a consultation w/ me anyway! He seemed like he was working w/ the insurance companies to save them the $$$ of surgery rather than trying to help find the best thing for me!  Fortunately, it was suggested that I have consultations w/ 2 different drs! Pagani was a definite NO! Dr. Sabol was my other consultation & was more highly recommended & I was very impressed by Dr. Sabol's consultation, so I'd suggest you check out Sabol & Golding's office & skip the Pagani visit! (Btw, I do *NOT* work for or get ANY compensation from recommending Sabol & Golding! I just hate seeing anyone have no alternatives when they are looking for a good Dr. GOOD LUCK!!! :-) )

At least the pharmacy is open 24/7! I don't know why the GOOD Walgreens on Central & Osborn isn't 24/7...  I just went to this Walgreens at 36th St & Thomas & NOT impressed!  Pharmacist has a very strong accent & there was no speaker, so I could barely understand him through the box. He couldn't find my info at first & kept asking if I used a different name, even though I told him no & had JUST filled at the Central & Osborn Walgreens LAST WEEK. He finally found me & then ended up only giving me 2 of my 3 prescriptions!  Will I go back to this location? Not unless it's 3am & I can't find another Walgreens! :-P

I had 2 oral surgery consultations w/ 2 different Drs. Dr. Sabol was 1 of my potential Drs.  The office is bright, open, & welcoming! The staff seemed to be nice & competent. There were people in the waiting room. A couple waiting on (presumably) a child having a surgery was talked to by 1 of the nurses or attendants & she was very reassuring to them & just seemed really a good thing for concerned family.  I got called back to the exam room & it was all very bright & clean. Dr. Sabol came in after my X-ray & gave a lot of very good info. He answered all my questions & even said that if my insurance denies the approval of surgery, they'll fight for me to get what I need! Which I think is even more impressive considering they're out-of-network for me, so they'd have to do more work than normal!  You might ask "Why didn't you rate 5-stars?" Well, I intend to go back & would rather change this to a 5-star after I have more experience & see how the surgery goes, since the primary reason for the rating here is for the *surgery* aspect...   I did go to both of my consultation appts (the other Dr will remain unnamed in this review... if you're really curious, just read my other reviews!) & the other dr simply reinforced my decision to go w/ Dr. Sabol, even though I was pretty sure I was going to choose Dr. Sabol after the consultation! :-)  Watch for an update on surgery-based rating within the year, hopefully! :-) GOOD LUCK!!! :-)

I'd gone to chiropractors for years before Dr. Q. Many times, I'd feel better the next day after an adjustment & thought that's just how it worked. I moved to AZ & didn't go to a chiropractor for a few years, until I was in pain, & finally went to Dr. Q. While I was still in the office, I was immediately starting to feel better!  As long as Dr. Q is in practice & we're both in the Phoenix area, Dr. Q will be my chiropractor! :-)

I've been in Phoenix for almost 10 years now & I've FINALLY found a great dentist! :-)  Very clean & welcoming office! The staff are all friendly & very helpful! :-)  I was never provided a dental insurance card, so the receptionist was able to get it all for me from the insurance company & then they provided me a copy of the info when I went back later to request it! :-)  Dr. Harmon seems to be quite up-to-date on the latest dentistry, as he had more advanced dental cleaning procedures & such than I've ever experienced! :-)  He explained that I needed a filling for a tooth that had broken & that if I didn't get it filled soon, I'd need a crown, so I made an appt for the filling, too. When I went back for the filling, he did a GREAT job & didn't even have to use Novocain!  The ONLY complaint I have is that the hygienist shortened my name w/o asking if I approved of it, which I HATE when people do that... & I think the paperwork may've even asked what name I wish to go by! But she was good other than that.

So good! Been wanting to check this place out since they opened! Why'd it take me so long?! I need to go way more often! :-)

Very disappointing! :-( Good food, but tons of problems!  1st, waitress almost skipped me for drink orders (she would've if I hadn't waved her down as she was leaving!)  2nd, I had to ask for a drink 2 separate times & still didn't get it until friend was like "he's still waiting for his drink!", so 3 times total!  3rd, friend ordered shrimp alfredo & it had ZERO shrimp ($2 increase!), so it was sent back only to be returned with a bunch of shrimp tails! It's in a wrap style, so shrimp tails should've totally been removed!  4th, the check was very clearly split up, but still charged wrong!  Not somewhere I'd recommend for groups. It might be ok for 1-3 people, but not sure...  I'm not a person to typically be harsh, but this was kinda ridiculous! I'd've given it a 1 star rating, but my food actually tasted good... But very overpriced! $40 for a personal pizza & 2 martinis!

YAY! Closer Krispy Kreme location! I got 2 donuts through the drive-thru. Standard awesome Original Glazed! The server was very nice! Only immediate thing I'd change is that the drive-thru entrance isn't marked. You have to drive behind the entire little strip mall to get there. Not a big deal, though.

Pretty good! :-) Mom got the Green Chile Omelette & liked it! :-) I got the blackberry pancakes & they were yummy! :-) Only thing that bugged me was that the "pancake special" was offered to me, which adds 2 bacon/sausage & 2 eggs. I'm allergic to eggs, so I asked if they could drop the eggs & double the bacon. I was told they'd check. Brought pancakes & 3 bacon (not 4). Bill came & pancakes & bacon were charged separately. Not real pleased by that, but otherwise good place!  Nice place & staff! :-)  P.S., The bacon was pretty thick & crisp, which is how I like it, so that was really good! Even minus a piece :-P haha

Came here for lunch w/ some friends. They didn't have a menu yet, so they said they allow people to bring food in, so we went to get food & bring it back. I was planning to get a drink when I got back w/ food, but when I returned, they'd turned up the music nearly full-blast & a friend that'd stayed has ear trouble & complained that the music was too obnoxiously loud. Not to turn it off, but just down to a reasonable level so we could hear each other talk. (this was midday, Sat around 2-3pm, I think, not like it was 11pm on a Sat or anything!) & they gave my friend a hard time about it & barely gave us any service at all! Due to the issues, I didn't bother getting any drinks. Others were of a similar mindset & didn't get drinks, either, due to this bad attitude from the management.  I really had hoped for a better experience, as I'm the 1 who dragged them all there to try it out, but none of us are going back...
