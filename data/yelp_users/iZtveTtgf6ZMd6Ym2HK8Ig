The Boy and I wanted sushi tonight and wavered between Sting Ray and CherryBlossom.  I'd forgotten about my one glorious trip to the Noodle Cafe until tonight, so it got my vote. (The Noodle Cafe is not forgettable - it's just that we're always trying new places so sometimes we forget to go back to places we love.)    Just like last time there were people waiting outside and we were told it'd be 20 minutes before we got a table.  It was really only about 15, but the food is SO worth the wait.  Tonight we ordered 3 sushi rolls: the crispy California, double crispy shrimp and the caterpillar roll.  All were super tasty! I love that they roll some of their rolls (the "crispy" ones) in panko crumbs - you seriously have to try one.  I think we may have ordered the same rolls last time because they're just that good!   Last time we went I enjoyed the Spicy Korean Beef dish SO MUCH that it was really difficult for me to try something new this time.  I made a last minute decision to try the TanTan-Men Ramen dish which is a "Sichuan Style Very Spicy Noodle Soup with Minced Pork."  I was worried about the "very spicy" part only because I'm not usually that tough when it comes to Asian spices.  However, since the Spicy Korean Beef had been that perfect amount of spicy - the kind that makes your lips numb but isn't painful - I decided to be brave.  I am not kidding you - this is the best Asian dish I've ever eaten!!!  Don't get me wrong, kids - it's SPICY.  My lips were numb, my tongue was tingly and my nose got a little runny.  At one point I may have told The Boy my stomach was on fire.  But I loved every minute of it!  And the best part is they gave me an enormous bowl full - so I had plenty to take home for a second round of yumminess!  The Boy has ordered the Pad Thai and Hakata Ramen - both tasty, but neither as tasty as my dishes! :) :)  In short - HA too late - DEFINITELY try  CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe.  Especially if you like spicy food. :) :)

WHOA!  I felt so taken care of at this Home Depot!! :)  The Boy asked me to stop and pick up 2 gallons of paint on my way home because he'd run out.  As soon as I got to the paint aisle and had a gallon in each hand, he called and asked that I actually buy 5 gallons of paint - better to have too much than run out again. :) Not even thinking about it, I put my 2 gallons back, grabbed the handle of a 5 gallon bucket of paint, and started walking down the aisle to get it tinted.  I didn't get very far before I realized how heavy the stupid thing was and wondered how I would make it all the way to the car, let alone get it more than 3 inches off the ground and IN to the car.  Just then, Friendly Guy #1 from the paint section came down the aisle and asked if I needed help.  YES PLEASE!  He carried the bucket to the tinting area and I went off in search of a cart.  Once my paint was ready, Friendly Guy #1 loaded it onto my cart, told me to have a nice day, and off I went to check out.  As I pushed my cart to the check out, I slowed by the self-checkout lanes - wondering if I could scan the bucket without having to lift it.  Friendly Guy #2 running the self-checkout area spotted me and said, "Let me help you!" He motioned to one of the registers and then scanned it with his scanner.  Voila!  Then Friendly Guy #2 told me to have a nice day, and I was off!  I was pretty stoked at this point because now all I had to do was get it in the car! :)  Enter Friendly Guy #3.  The second I walked out the door, before I even got my sunglasses on, Friendly Guy #3 spots me and offers to help load the paint into my car.  He helped pull the cart to my car and loaded it up for me.  Then HE told me to have a nice day and off he went (returning my empty cart for me).    Thanks to The Boy, I frequent a lot of different Home Depots and Lowe's locations.  I'm usually not impressed with their customer service because, let's face it - they're guys helping guys...conversations are stereotypically short and to the point with very few niceties.  The 3 (count them - 3) guys that helped me today were nothing but genuinely friendly.  I would gladly go back without The Boy in tow and feel comfortable knowing at least some of their guys are the good ones there and actually want to help me. :)  (Wish I'd caught their names....I think I was just too busy counting my lucky stars that I didn't have to lift that stupid bucket....)

David's Bridal was the hero in my wedding story!  They saved me TWICE.    First, the bridesmaid dresses my girls ordered off-line were hideous and unwearable.  The ladies at David's Bridal patiently found me every dress in the color I wanted (a discontinued shade of peacock blue) available in the sizes I needed - they searched their entire stock - every warehouse in the country!! We found dresses that were super affordable and could be shipped in time. My girls looked AH.MAZE.ING.   Next, after a serious let down with my boutique wedding dress alterations and overall experience, I came to them again - teary and broken-hearted with almost NO money to pay for a second wedding dress ONE WEEK before my wedding. Again, the ladies took me under their wings, found me every dress in my size (thankfully I fit perfectly into an 8 and wouldn't need it taken in cause there was no time for that) within my price range, and supported me through the process. I found THE DRESS, and when I cried, they cried. The seamstress swept me into the fitting rooms, pinned the length and bustle, and all for such a reasonable price that it was super clear I'd been totally overcharged by The Disaster Dress I already owned. My dress was rushed through alterations and ready to pick up days later. It was perfect and my day was saved!!    Throughout it all - the ladies at David's Bridal were caring, helpful, and supportive. They never once judged me for the mistakes I'd made not coming to them first and they were realistic with me; their goal always to find dresses I could have and not let me get hung up on things I couldn't (due to price and time). I owe them so much! They honestly saved the wedding!!!  I have no idea how they could possibly have such bad reviews on YELP, though I'll admit that their overall reputation is what kept me from starting here in the first place. But I cannot say enough good things about the ladies at this location and my overall experience.

This review is for the new children's library on the campus.  The new library is BEAUTIFUL!  I'm hoping that without a lot of kid traffic it may be a sanctuary for teachers who want to be able to find the books they need to bring to their classrooms and share with their students.  They don't have as large of a selection as Burton Barr, but they do have some titles you can't find at the other branches.  The shelves are well stocked but not so tightly packed that browsing becomes a chore.  It's peaceful (like a library should be), but it could use some more seating.   I have to be honest that I find the coolest part of this library to be the tiny cafe at the back - they serve Starbucks coffee and tasty pastries at very decent prices.    Books, coffee, and sweets plus silence and organization...... It's like heaven!  If only it weren't so far away from me....

My review of Burton Barr will be based ONLY on their children's section and not the rest of the library.  I've heard wonderful things about all that the library has to offer for adults but I really only use libraries to check out books for my classroom.    Throughout my 6.5 years of teaching, I have acquired over 1100 children's books of my own.  Aside from the fact that I love children's books one of the main reasons I choose to buy books for my room rather than check them out is because the library is just so difficult to rely on when it comes to getting the books I need.  I teach small children, so I am fully aware of how hard it is to keep things organized if kids are allowed to touch them.  But isn't the point of the Dewey decimal system lost if books are NEVER organized back to their rightful places on the shelves?  Every time I try to check out books from Burton Barr I have to spend hours looking for them.  The computer says they're checked in, but guess what - they're never where they're supposed to be.  I get that there are budget cuts and not as many librarians as we most certainly need in such a large section, but come on.  Stop worrying about the kids who want to play on the computers and start organizing the shelves!  According to the online system, the library has a wonderful collection of books to entice children off the computers and into the world of reading, so why isn't it more important to put those books in their hands and make them easy for people to find?  Back in the day, I used to load up my class and head to the library for our first field trip of the year.  They made sure every kid was signed up for a library card before we went so they could all leave with a book.  I was always disappointed when we'd show up and sit through a puppet show instead of learning about how to use the library or why they should even bother asking their parents to bring them back.  Perhaps if they'd spent years teaching the children who visited how to use the library rather than entertaining them with a puppet show the shelves would not always be in the sad state they are today.

Such a relief to have them in the neighborhood!     I don't need the auto parts stores often (The Boy is super handy!), but I'm glad that Checkers is near by when I need them.  I've been in twice this month and was pleased with both visits.  The first visit was some last minute Christmas shopping - an emergency car kit for my little sister.  I walked around and around but couldn't find one (not because it isn't well organized, but because I wasn't looking down).  I finally asked and a nice lady brought be right to them.  She then asked if there was anything else I needed and left me alone - something I value in sales people - the ability to leave me alone unless I ask for help.  The cashier who rung me up was a very friendly and chatty guy who proudly shared that he'd finished his Christmas shopping early for the first time in his life. :) I like it when people are normal chatty - not overly chatty - and he was just right.  My second visit was just this week when my car battery decided it was done.  I managed to get my car to start again and headed strait to Checkers to see what they could do for me.  David checked my battery, explained what "200 amps low" meant and quickly replaced my battery for me.  He, too, was friendly and chatty.  No awkward silence as we stood in the mostly empty parking lot - me doing nothing while he saved my day.  HOPEFULLY, I don't need any more parts for my car or anyone else any time soon, but if I do - I will definitely go back to MY Checker's on Bethany.  :) :)  (It's actually called O'Reilly now...)

Worthy of my FIRST review!  Last weekend I was totally sick - I didn't want to go anywhere! The Boy wanted a quick lunch out and since he chose Mexican food (my favorite), I tagged along - fully expecting not to enjoy my meal since I was feeling so crappy.  I was so wrong!!  I ordered 2 chicken tacos (flour) off the ala carte menu, The Boy ordered a carne asada burrito and we shared chips, salsa and guacamole.  OH MY GOSH!!  The guacamole was super tasty - it has a strong cilantro flavor, which I'm not usually fond of, but I couldn't stop eating it.  Their homemade salsa was BEYOND amazing - I guarantee I ate more than my boyfriend because I didn't want to share it! It's a roasted onion and pepper mixture that I'm in love with!  It doesn't look like its going to be very flavorful, it's mostly greenish yellow, but it is definitely the best (non spicy) salsa I've ever had - no joke.  I can't really tell you about the carne asada - I tried it, but very quickly because I was so set on getting back to my chicken tacos.  I am normally a chimi, deep fried burrito, or flauta fan - I rarely order tacos.  I ordered their chicken tacos because I don't like rice in my burritos (only complaint for this place).  I'm SO GLAD I did. They are the BEST flavored chicken tacos ever!! The chicken isn't that gross, slimy dark meat some places use or the dry, bland white meat used at other establishments.  Their chicken is so moist and flavorful - I could eat a bowl of it all by itself!!  I love chicken and this might be the best chicken I've ever had outside my boyfriend's cooking!  Now - the icing on the cake - raspado.  You CAN NOT visit this place and skip ordering one - you will be missing out!!  I'd never had this Mexican snow cone before, but it is now one of my favorite desserts.  I ordered the strawberry-mango raspado, despite the fact that it was rainy and cold that day, because the picture of it was so enticing. I literally "mmmmmed" as I ate every bite.  I even willingly went to a store I normally roll my eyes over without complaining because I was so engrossed in eating my treat.  I was completely full half way through, but couldn't stop eating it and ended up beyond stuffed by the time it was all gone.  And who is serving all this wonderful food?? A sweet lady with a thick Spanish accent who I wanted to call Abuelita.  I can't wait to return and eat the exact same thing again! It was so amazingly delicious that I have no idea if I will ever try anything else on the menu because I won't want to miss out on my new favorite meal!

Another "place to check-out" that I recently checked off my list (winter vacation is great!).  :)  Naturally I headed here after visiting Frances next door and I was sadly let down again.  Are these two places owned by the same person? They certainly have a similar opinion on what reasonable prices are.....  AGAIN - I understand that its a cute little boutique with retro candy and that it's supposed to be this ultra trendy "NEW" place, but....cheese and rice!  $2.50 for ONE piece of candy smaller than my palm???  Really? Is it flecked in gold? I didn't think so.  Tasty, sure, but.... Treats shouldn't come at such a high price.  Maybe they make them expensive so you don't buy a ton and ruin your dinner...I dunno, but.  They don't even have a decent selection of Jelly Belly Jelly Beans - which (unfortunately for them) is how I rate my candy stores.  Most of the candy is some sort of taffy or chewy something - what about all the hard candies??  The silver lining? Funny and random little things to buy like a Gandhi pen, miniature farm animals, candy cigarettes, and craft sets.  At least there was something to keep me entertained while my friend shopped for the few pieces of candy she was willing to pay for.

Stopped here for lunch with The Boy today after a morning of driving through neighborhoods looking at houses for sale.  I ordered a regular, plain hot dog with a side of onion rings.  (Aside from Maui Dog, I don't really do more than ketchup on my dogs.)  The Boy had the Chicago Dog with all the fixin's and an order of fries.  We both agreed that the hot dogs were pretty good.  I think I could definitely handle a Jumbo Dog, though...the one I had was pretty small.  I thought the hot dog had a good taste and the bun was soft and fresh.  I LOVED the onion rings and even had to share with The Boy after he tasted them.  I liked the fries, too, but he thought the onion rings were better.  I thought the service was extremely friendly and it was really clean, too.  Sadly even though it wasn't that busy it took a little bit for the food to come out.  There were about 4 or 5 orders that all seemed to come out at the same time.  But - like I said, really friendly staff.  As for the comparison to the neighborhood rockstar Chicago Hamburger Company....apples and oranges my friends.  I LOVE Chicago Hamburger Company - I really do!!! But I go there for sliders....HAMBURGERS....not hot dogs.  Both places have awesome buns and onion rings, but one serves hot dogs and the other serves hamburgers.  Besides - sometimes the wait at CHC makes it impossible to eat there - especially when there's nowhere to sit....there's another plus for Joey's - plenty of seats to sit in as you wait for your food.  :)

Short story: the food is great, the service sucks. SUCKS. I'd love to give Butters a perfect review, but...no.  The food was delicious and you certainly get a LOT of it. I had the Popeye scrambler and added avocado with pancakes and cheesy grits. The scrambler was packed with the toppings, the pancakes were perfect, and the cheesy grits were like yummy mac 'n cheese with a creamy consistency.   The check was dropped off with the standard "no worries, I'll take this when you're ready" about 2 minutes after the food came. That should've been our first warning sign that they wanted our table for a big party that was waiting. Our waitress, Becca, never came back after that. We had to ask for refills of the coffee and then listen to her complain about how long we were taking about 6 feet from our table. Possibly in an effort to help move us along, the bussers began removing things from our table one by one the second there was one empty plate...water caraf, water glasses that we were still drinking from, syrup bottle, etc. After feeling really uncomfortable about sitting at our table, we got up to leave. As we did, Becca was coming out of the kitchen with another table's order. She turned back to the kitchen staff and said, "Oh NOW they get up!" I looked her in the eye and told her that was really rude. She looked away. My father-in-law spoke to the manager about it and was told they had 150 people waiting for tables, as if that were a good excuse for being openly rude to customers.  While good food is definitely what you go to a restaurant for, good service will make or break the experience. Considering this was breakfast, it was a total downer to start my day. Unfortunately, I won't be back any time soon.

I have been wanting to try The Habit for a while now and was pleasantly surprised!    I had the Charburger with American cheese, onion rings, and a chocolate shake.  I was a little surprised that I had to pay extra for cheese - especially when there were only 2 choices (American or Swiss).  I may have added on avocado, too, if it wasn't $1.00 (mainly because I can buy an entire avocado for that price across the street at Safeway...).  The burger was really good but the onion rings were EXCELLENT - and believe me - I know my onion rings! :)  They were thickly coated and perfectly cooked.  There were no puddles of grease left behind, either.  You know what was odd, though?  When I asked for ranch for my rings, they gave it to me - for free!  They'll give me a huge cup of ranch for free, but charge a whole dollar for avocado? Not sure how that makes sense, BUT - it was tasty, so whatever.  The chocolate shake was only okay - it tasted very strongly of Hershey's chocolate syrup...there's gotta be a better way to make a shake, no?  Overall I was pleased with my visit and will definitely go back when I need a burger and rings fix.

I seriously LOVE this place.  I just got a phone that will allow me to check-in places the other day, otherwise I'd be runner up for the Duchess!!!  I can't get enough!  I LOVE the Honey Bacon Club (Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Tomatoes, Muenster Cheese and Honey Mustard panini).  I've had the Turkey Bacon Avocado Club and had bites of the Ultimate Grilled Cheese and the Vegetarian sandwiches The Boy ordered but none of them compare to my HBC! :)    I also love that you can try AS MANY SOUPS as you want before settling on one.  AND there are toppings for your soup!! Cheese, tortilla strips, sour cream, bacon... My favorite has been the Wisconsin Cauliflower - which is like potato soup except it's cauliflower instead of potatoes.  All the soups come with a generous hunk of tasty bread AAAAAANNNNNNNDDD a chocolate dipped strawberry.    Just writing this review makes me want Zupas for dinner! :)   SO - why only 4 stars instead of 5? Well....its the service.  Maybe they're over-staffed because they just opened and they're training people, I dunno, but the amount of workers there wanting to take your order, say hello, wish you a nice day, etc....is overwhelming to say the least and slightly annoying.  I also appreciate the gesture of having one worker walk around (or wander aimlessly) and clear your trays for you, BUT - it makes me feel like I'm being watched while I eat.  I'm hoping they reduce their staff as they get used to their flow of traffic.  Otherwise, I'll be taking my food to go! :)

Working with Budd was great!  He was so friendly and easy to talk to that meeting with him to "work" on wedding details felt more like hanging out than working!  This made us feel relaxed and made it easier for him to get to know us which made his telling of our love story feel so much more personal.  His online portal made it easy for us to work on song selections a little bit at a time as well as create a super detailed (and helpful!) timeline for the night of our wedding.  Our wedding ran smoothly and everyone had a great time!  He even switched up music and geared it towards the guests that were out on the dance floor after a few made requests that wouldn't have normally been on our playlists (not because we didn't like them - because we hadn't thought about them!).  All in all having Budd there made it easier for us to have a great time and not worry about the flow of the evening.  He was definitely our Master of Ceremonies and not just the DJ.  I loved having him there and will definitely go to him should I ever need a DJ for an event in the future!!

I really wanted to love Kaira's - but overall, my wedding dress ended up being the biggest source of stress for my wedding along with the worst overall experience.    Long story short: Their customer service was excellent when I first tried on dresses and made the purchase.  From then on they were polite at best, sometimes friendly, but always running late and putting me on hold/asking to call me back.  I was told it'd be 3 months to get my dress but it took 6 with them saying that the initial 3 month quote was just for a delivery DATE, not actual delivery. (?!?!)   I thought the dress I tried on was a "fit and flare" (tight thru the waist and hip, straight out from there) based on the way it was clamped onto me when I tried it on (it was too big). When I got it, it turned out to be a mermaid dress (tight through the hips and thighs, straight out from the knees) - which was definitely NOT the look I was going for.  I wish the girl who helped me fix it had shown me what it would look like if it fit me before I bought it.... When I got my dress, it wasn't taken in to make it the full mermaid look so it looked awful on me...she did a great job hemming it and opening the back like I asked, but it cost a fortune once the bustles were added in.  I left wishing I had almost any dress but that one.  If you'd told me it wasn't the dress I'd ordered 6 months ago but something different - I wouldn't have been surprised because it looked THAT different.  When I got it home to try on for my parents (20 minutes later, literally drove from the boutique to my parents' house), the zipper broke and the hook fell apart when I put it on. After many tears, a trip to a different seamstress (who actually made it look pretty good on me despite me not wanting the mermaid look), and sleepless nights, I ended up buying an entirely different dress from a different store A WEEK before my wedding in order to shake off my negative feelings towards the dress - which I was not looking forward to taking hundreds of pictures in...   The other bridal store will get a 5 star review...Kaira's gets a generous 2 stars and that's only because I didn't give them a chance to fix any of their mistakes.  I was just too disappointed, stressed, and uncomfortable with their change in customer service after things were paid for to work with them for one more second.  I didn't feel as though I could trust them to help me in any way.  Moral of the story?  I should have checked their Yelp reviews BEFORE shopping there....

Holy sandwich menu, Batman!! That was the best meatball sub EVER (called the Micheal Jordan for a good reason)!! The Boy got the Handsome Owl and it was a delicious vegetarian sandwich I'd consider getting my meat-loving self if I weren't worried about missing out on the meatballs!! The Dutch Crunch bread our sandwiches came on was super tasty with plenty of crunch AND soft chewiness. They even let me put the fried zucchini ON my sandwich instead of on the side!! These are the kind of sandwiches that are so tasty, you feel like you have to eat every bite - even if there's no room in your stomach.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful when choosing from the huge list of choices. It was a fun place to be and their Happy Hour special for people eating there was a free drink and chips with your sandwich!! Even the music playing was great (old school R&B/rap...the fun stuff everyone loves to sing along with)! I can't wait till one opens in Phoenix. Hey Ike!! There's an old JB's that's closed on the corner of 32nd St. and Indian School - how about opening up shop there?!?!? I promise to bring all my friends!!

I was greeted with a pleasant "Hi! Welcome in!" from an employee organizing nearby and later asked from a few feet away if I was doing ok. Other than that I got to shop in peace without being harassed. When I had a question, it was answered - again, without the harassment of an assumed sale.  The prices are reasonable, selection is pretty big, and I found a lot that I liked! If you're out looking for furniture that's not from IKEA or Pottery Barn - check them out!
