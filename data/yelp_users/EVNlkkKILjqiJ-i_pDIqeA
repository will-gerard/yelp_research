My husband was complaining that we don't have a "Go-To" Chinese place. Well I think we may have found it! Placed a To-Go order by phone and within 15 minutes there was a knock on the door! Ordered the Cashew Chicken and Lemon Chicken and hey threw in the a tab Puffs for free. We will definitely be ordering again soon!!

Came here to try something new. Maybe we should have stuck to our favorites. The water they serve here tastes like it came out of a garden hose, no amount of lemon could save it. After ordering drinks, we waiting what seemed to be a lifetime for the waitress to come back to ask questions about the menu and order. My bf ordered the shrimps tacos but got fish tacos. He ate what he continued to eat them because the waitress never came back to check on the food. He thought they were the worst tacos he had ever had. He did not finish them. Something had got to be pretty bad for him to leave food on his plate. The only time I would ever come back here would be for happy hour but even then probably not.

Drink was WAY too sweet! I would rather drive two miles down the road and way in the long but super fast line at Dutch Bros. Too bad they have to use T&A to sell their product.
