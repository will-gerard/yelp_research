Best film festival in the whole southwest!  All of the movies are played in one theater which makes a big difference as you can go from screen to screen to get your movie watching groove on!  It seems like the put a lot of heart and soul into this event and it gets better every year!

This hotel needs to be sold and have a complete makeover of the rooms. The common areas are nice. However the rooms are rundown and I felt like I was trapped in crackhouse. Okay, not really, but the rooms are really worn down. Don't let the pictures on their website fool you. Gave them an extra star because the staff was really nice.

I travel all the way from Tulsa, Oklahoma to see Dr. Brigham.  He is by far the most professional and caring orthodontist that I have ever had experience with.  His staff is so friendly and they really go out of their way to help me as I am traveling half way across country for my appointment.  I do invisalign and my smile is getting so much better as my teet are getting straighter.  Dr. B rocks! very affordable too!

What can I say??  This place is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Phoenix!   The outdoor patio is really cool and the service has always been spot on.  They even have coca-cola in the bottle!  I have never had a bad meal here and the rib eye steak tacos are awesome with the homemade pancake style tortillas!  You can not go wrong at Chelsea's Kitchen!

Okay...so this is my second time there and my second review.  the first one was not so good and in all fairness I was contacted by someone from the white chocolate grill and they sent me a $25.00 gift card apologizing for my past experience and asked me to give them another try.  i found this to be quite refreshing and it says a lot about a place when they try to make things right!  So, with that being said..off we ventured to give it another try!  From the moment we arrived we were greeted by the hostess who sat us promptly and informed as that Tara would be our server.  from the time it too Tara to reach us ( about 10 minutes) we were helped by the busser who made sure that we had drinks, etc.  this time here our water glasses were refreshed constantly and the service was very attentive.  My wife and I both ordered the date night out special which you had choices of an appetizer, salad, entree, and desert all for 28.99!  Was a lot of food, but a really great deal.  The food this time was decent as well except the steak could have been seasoned a little bit more.  I must say that they did a great job this time and I am glad that I got the chance to go back and have them make it right!  I will continue to come here in the future because of that effort of theirs alone!

This dog park is just okay. Lots of room for the dogs to run and play however it seems that there are people there who do not watch their dogs thus creating some chaos. Would be better if the owners were more aware and responsible for their own animal!  My dogs seem to enjoy playing there though!

okay so I take my two dogs here and they really seem to enjoy it.  In all honesty it is a great place for them to interact with other dogs and get out of the house and run all day.  That is why I give them a one star.  Both my dogs have been injured since going there.  Now as a dog owner I know that dogs will be dogs and sometimes around other dogs there are things that happen.  I understand that...what I don't understand is that when my one dog got hurt a few weeks back they told me when I cam to pick him up that they didn't know how it happened but he has a little scrape and not to worry they bandaged it up.  they also said that he probably did not need to go to the vet.  WELL...300 dollars later after the vet visit my dog had a torn pad.  I did not have a problem with him having a torn pad..the problem I had was that they minimized his injury and pretended like nothing happened.  So, since this happened I gave them the benefit of the doubt and took my dogs back there the next week.  WELL..guess what..when I went to pick them up they said that my other dog had a scratch or cut under his leg and it was no big deal.  I asked them what had happened and they said they didn't know, but we cleaned it up and its nothing to worry about.  I asked if I should take him to the vet and once again they said no..its no big deal....WELL.. when I got home I looked at this little cut and it was more like a gaping hole down into his flesh oozing blood..obviously it looked like another dog had bitten him.  So off to the vet we go and another 300 dollars later...he also had a ripped pad.. and the vet said that he could se where another dog had bit him because there are teeth mark in the flesh...so two visits to this place and 600 dollars later I am a little bit disenchanted by the people who work here.  I kind of sense that they weren't being honest with me with what actually happened.  It's very frustrating...my dogs love going there, but It's probably safe to say that they won't be going back.  I just think that the people working there could be a little more honest and not minimize what happened.  this is the only problem I have with this place..other than that it appears to be a great facility that the dogs can roam in..I just wished that they could be more honest when stuff happens.

Okay...well..let me see...after the haboob hit here in Phoenix my pool was extremely dirty with tree shavings and massive amounts of dirt.  My pool cleaner (a Barracuda MX8) was working overtime. I just actually bought the thing a few weeks ago and to be honest its quite the piece of crap and keeps getting stuck.  So one could only imagine how bad it started working after the apocalypse storm what we had.  The pool cleaner completely shut down.  I called the store that I bought it from and the said that I had to get it look at before they could even consider replacing it and that I had to take it to Leslie's to get it looked at.  they were the only service center that was authorized for this cleaner.  So I take it to Leslie's and some young snot nosed Ahwatukee brat that worked there was not really into helping me at all.  He grudgingly took the cleaner, tagged it and said we will call you tomorrow.  Well..tomorrow came and went and there was no call so I had my wife stop bye there later the next day.  When she got to the store she asked and informed the worker that i had brought the cleaner in a few days ago and that she wanted to know what was wrong with it.  Well...boy genius said that he knew nothing about it and loked around like a lost puppy.  A few minutes later he came back with the cleaner in hand and asked her if this was it?  When she said yes and asked what was wrong with it this kid said that it was working fine and that he had taken it apart and everything was good.  REALLY?  my wife asked because you seemed to not know anything about it a few minutes ago.  To that he replied again that he personally took it apart and that everything was fine.  So when she gets home I open up the cleaner to find water residue in it and debris that was stuck between the gears. If idiot boy had taken it apart like he said wouldn't one think that he would have wiped it down and taken out the debris?  Maybe it was the debris that was preventing the darn thing from working?SO IN OTHER WORDS...the little turd lied.  I called the manager and informed him of this and he seemed quite surprised by this.  However when I brought it back in and he took it apart he saw that his employee had completely lied.  If this is how they do business I suggest to people who are taking their pool cleaners there to get serviced that they double check to make sure that they are not lying to you too.  the only reason I gave the a one star was because the manager reprimanded the little turd and tried to make things right.  This is just bad business.  THE END

This place is by far the best mediteranean food in Phoenix. The falafel is the best falafel I have ever had. Try the chicken schwarma or lamb.. Both are very good! The owner Etgar is very personable and fun to banter with!  This place also has the best hummus by far.  So, give it try you won't be sorry that you did!

This place is kind of gross, however it hits the spot when you may be craving greasy mexican food that is cheap.  Stay away from the guacamole though as it is pretty gross.

I really like this place and the service is fantastic.  It really seems that they try to provide great service.  The food is a little pricey, but their chopped salad is great as well as their steaks.  If you don't like the Scottsdale scene then this place is not for you, however if you do and like great service and quality food then you must try it!

Okay..so I have been to this place at least 5 times and I keep thinking that the service will get better...well..that never happened, but as dumb as I am I decided to give it another try for lunch today...FAIL...it was..plainly put...horrible!!  The food got worse than it was before and as there was not a whole lot of people there at 3pm for lunch, I was surprised by this and the fact that it took almost 35 minutes to get our food.  Five times of coming here has added up to mediocre food, cold food, and to be quite honest shitty crappy slow service!  Don't know what it is because they have a good menu and location, but maybe they need to find people to work there who take great pride in service and food quality.  My carne asada torta tasted like ten day old meat that was scraped off of the ground in the back during the morning breakfast rush!  Anyhow...five times is enough..I won't be coming back as I know that I have given it enough chances to become a regular spot of my dining experience!

Benny taking my two labs here since we have had them. They are always great and efficient. Dr. Olsen is very professional and attentive. Chainey is also great as she gives special attention to our dogs when we are there. If your looking for a great vet in Ahwatukee this is it!

I had been wanting to try to this place for awhile now and today I finally did as I was driving on my way home and was craving a hot dog.  It's a quaint little place and I presume that most of thier business is done from take out.  I ordered the chicago style hot dog with an angus sirloin dog..it was fantastic...one of the best hot dogs that I have had in a really long time...actually it was the ONLY hot dog that I have had in the last year..Further, the people who run the place(i think they were the owners) were really nice and helpful and acted as if I have been a regular.  I am going to be a repeat customer for sure!

This place just opened and it appears that they are still working out the kinks.  the yogurt is 42 cents an ounce which appears to be a little pricey for the quality of the yogurt.  they also offer soft serve ice cream, but the machine was not working and I would have had to wait another 20 minutes if I wanted it.  On a whole, this place is no different than golden spoon or any of the other yogurt places, however it is more expensive.

I was really impressed with Seasons 52. Although it is a chain I found it to be very good. The service was fantastic and the food was very fresh. All of the dishes are even under 500 calories how could you go wrong with that? I had the filet. It was perfectly prepared. My friend had the cheese grits and he said that he loved it! Also the mini deserts were excellent. All in all this place is great. I will be coming back the next time that I am in Phoenix. Wish they had one in Tulsa.

Have always wanted to try Beckett's table. So, I was in Phoenix enduring the 117  degree blistery, sweltering, hot day and said to myself, "Hey! Its time to try Beckett's table". I am happy that I did! The service was great from the hostess to the busboy to the server. Very knowledgable and informative about the menu. I had the red roasted pepper soup accompanied by the grilled cheese. The soup was phenomenal, the grilled cheese just...meh...too much bread. The stars are for the ambiance and service...the food was just kind of average. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. However, I will be back the next time that I am in Phoenix!

This company is top notch and really provides a great service. Dawn ( the owner is professional and organized. She also has such a great connection with our dogs that I think they look forward to when she comes to dog sit them. I have used other pet sitting services in the valley, but none of them compared to the quality of service and professionalism that this one provided. I highly recommend that you give them a call...you won't be disappointed!
