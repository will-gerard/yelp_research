Poor customer service. When I asked if they were able to check stock at another near location for a product they were out of, the lady threw up her hands and asked me if I knew where the next closest location was and simply told me "I don't know". She then told me if I waited she MIGHT be able to look it up. So I waited and finally just left when i realized she had no intention of returning to help me as she decided to help another customer. It seemed to me that having 3 customers in the store was too much to handle for 2 employees.... Being that I just relocated from out of state, I've quickly learned this is not a place ill be returning to, regardless of its proximity to my house. I drove to the Mesa location and received 5 star customer service.

Great service for a seriously great deal!! Last time I locked myself out of my car I got scammed by a company who charged me nearly $200 for a 10 minute job! This company his high ethics and morals and the guy who came out to help was really friendly and upfront about the cost (1/4th of what other businesses would charge.)  If I ever need locks switched or get locked out again, they'll have my lifetime business!

Locked myself out AGAIN! And yet again, words can't express how thankful I am to have found an honest, kind and efficient locksmith! They even offered me water because I had been out in the hot sun! HIGHLY RECOMMEND their services. You won't regret it- they're a hard working & honest locksmith!

I signed up for the wellness plan and it's been one of the best decisions I ever made. I was new to massage therapy but boy oh boy was it a worthwhile investment! The deep tissue has felt so nice and given that I have a chronic illness, it's been a very helpful & holistic way to destress and detox my body! I love the staff here, they are so so friendly and welcoming. I'm going to miss this place now that I'm relocating out of state!

The outside is deceiving! Walked in and the environment felt very warm, inviting, cool and romantic! I hate dining in bright light, makes everything feel loud. Luckily, at Thai basil, the lights are dimmed and jazzy music played in the background- finally a dinner place that's relaxing and easy on the wallet!  My boyfriend got the Pad Thai (we like to try this at every Thai place we eat) and it did not disappoint! As another reviewer mentioned, veggies were fresh and cooked just right! Great flavor and portion. I ordered red curry for the first time (I usually like green) and it was a hit for me too. Opted for medium spice and it was the perfect blend of flavorful and spicy but not to the point where your nose runs faster than you can catch.   Overall a great date night and attentive, friendly staff. Love supporting local businesses that deserve it!

Chipotle sauce= bomb.com!! For the price of mainstream mexican food you get moms cooking, healthienr and less greasy! and fresh guac, cant beat that! Make it how you want it and leave with a happy tummy! Only weird (for me) thing is everything is shredded, but does make the meat juicier.

I've been coming here since I moved to AZ 9 months ago and it's sufficed as a "ok" replacement for the quality work of my last eyebrow threading place! But today, I'm over the moon happy. It was the first time I walked out without teary eyes and my skin felt calm! Today a lady named Puspa threaded my eyebrows and she was THE BOMB! Seriously, my eyebrows look amazing and it didn't hurt one bit! She said she usually works Saturday mornings so I highly recommend coming then. Left her a good tip because I was so grateful!

Two things make me happy- veggies and cheese. My omelet arrived with loads of both! Really flavorful, fresh tasting and delicious. Fast service, kind waitresses and hostess! I can't believe I didn't come here sooner. You can get a full plate breakfast for under 5 bucks! Can't beat that! Really calm environment as well, perfect for the start to my day! Thanks, Sunny's!

Tried this food last night, sat there for 15 minutes before a waiter spoke with us/ acknowledged us. We were given a laminated sheet with sushi roll names by the person who sat us, it looked like we were supposed to check the ones we wanted off with a dry erase marker, however we didn't get one.... And being first time customers, it would be nice to know the descriptions of what's actually in the "Las Vegas" roll or "wave runner". A young man then approached us and asked us if we wanted something to drink, I finally felt a bit acknowledged (it was Friday evening and I was thirsty!) but when I asked him if there was a drink menu he simply asked me "well what do you want to drink?" I told him I didn't know because I didn't know what was available!  It felt like an endless circle of disappointment. The only reason we didn't leave and that I'm giving the place 2 stars is because the waitress we eventually got (I should have caught her name but she was a short Latina lady) she was amazing! Very attentive and checked in on us often. Gave her a good tip, I hope she got to keep it because her coworkers sucked.  Food wise- eh. I got stomach pains but the Vietnamese sandwich was pretty good considering I hadn't had one in so long!  One last thing, the bathroom is a little weird, sink is in a hallway (where servers are always walking in and out) and the floor was flooded/ super slippery... That's a lawsuit waiting to happen.   Probably won't go back....at least I got a nice beer.. Eventually. Lol.
