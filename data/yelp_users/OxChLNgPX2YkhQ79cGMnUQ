Carolina's West is not only friendly, but their food is incredible! My usual is the red and bean burrito, enchilada style. Their red chili is rich with chunks of beef, combine that with their delicious beans wrapped in a tortilla that's large enough to be a baby blanket topped with enchilada sauce, cheese and scallions, and you have a meal that good enough to slap your nana over! Carolina's West, a happy, family environment that once you experience it, you'll keep coming back over and over again. Tell Gina and Anna that I sent you.

I've heard so much of this place, but honestly, I am not a fan, asked about the corned beef hash, first thing my waitress said, "Well it's canned, but I guess it's decent." Coffee tasted as if it was from the day before. Overall not a good experience.

Today I enjoyed my first trip to Cafe 25:35 in Buckeye, AZ. I had their Cadrew that came with Chicken Fried Steak, savory gravy, Two Eggs, Cafe Fries, Bacon, Sourdough Toast, and Two Homemade Pancakes. I finished every bite, except for a portion of the eggs, which is my only small complaint, they were a tad overlooked... Overall a great experience, and worth the drive!

Senior's is what every barbershop should model itself after! My son and I were greeted with a smile as soon as we walked in the door. The shop is very clean, it took me back to when I was a kid... Except the had Flatscreen TV's and not the big tube TV, and ever screen had sports showing on it, not some music video with half naked women. Their chairs were the old school ones, big and comfortable!  The big seller for me, was I didn't hear one cuss word the entire time I was there. I have a 9 year old boy, and it's very important to me that he grows up a man, I know he hears   that mess in school, but if I can help minimize the amount of negativity that he absorbs in a daily bases, that's what I'll do, and that includes finding a barbershop with a positive feel like Senior's.   Thank you Yolanda for having such an exceptional shop, it is truly appreciated!
