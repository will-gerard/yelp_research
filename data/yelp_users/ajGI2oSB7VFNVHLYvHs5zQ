sitting in elie's right now and i have nothing but good things to say. the food is delicious, the owners are friendly, your order comes out FAST (i got my hummus and falafel pita within minutes of ordering--i barely had time to sit down!).  this is a little hole in the wall deli off 44th and thomas but well worth a visit. i haven't tried the famed gyro yet but i'm looking forward to it!

location is great, rooms are whatever for the price, but customer service is an absolute joke. from checking in (where i stood awkwardly in the cramped lobby while the front desk attendants flat out ignored me) to requesting silverware for the room (none of the kitchenettes come with ANY cookware or even cups and plates) was treated like i was asking them to pull down the moon. when i got turned around trying to even find the hotel and gave the front desk a few shops and streets around me, she snapped that she had no idea what i was talking about before giving me clipped, useless directions. i live nearby, so it's not like i was naming strange and random stores no one had heard of. in addition to this, there's some kind of bee infestation on the stairs near our room, completely blocking off that stairwell and turning just leaving the room into a practical gauntlet. the place is clearly understaffed, but i've worked in shorthanded hotels before, and we still always made an effort to ensure the guests didn't feel outright unwelcome.

i only stopped in here briefly, but what a gem! the owner is friendly and makes you feel instantly welcome, offering addins and altenatives to your drink order and gauging your tastes to customize it. i ordered a small green tea and ended up with a medium green tea with mint, cinnamon, and a little sugar--something i never would have thought i'd order, let alone like! i definitely plan on coming back.
