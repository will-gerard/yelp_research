Just tried this place yesterday & I am in love. I ordered a cheese bagel with sweet habanero spread. It was the yummiest thing ever!! I sadly didn't get to try it until I got to work and by then it was cold but still delicious. It was so good I went back this morning and ordered it again! This time I ate it on my way to work. So yummy when it's warm and toasty! I will probably be back tomorrow and will try to make myself try something new. There are a lot of options!   While I am in love with the bagel, the coffee was just meh. One review on here mentions that the mocha is better than Starbucks. I would have to disagree. Tried the latte today and was also not impressed. I like my coffee to be more on the sweet side though.  Also the older woman who is mentioned in another review is just as you described: short with words and grumpy. It's kind of a turn off but when the bagel is that good I will put up with it!   I don't like the debit card machine and the place to tip. I feel obligated to tip every time because they just look at you waiting for your response. I don't mind tipping but if I'm just getting a to go order is it really necessary?

They were courteous and responsive to my needs. Although sometimes the wait can be long, if you talk to them, they work with you. The oil change itself was fast and they made the experience painless.

Be prepared to make many visits when buying a new phone.   As I overheard another customer state, "Third time's the charm!"  Well I went one evening to switch my cell phone provider and purchase the new iPhone. It was ten minutes to closing (thought they closed at a different time) and was not even allowed in the store. So I head over the next night. I spend an hour there. I completely reset my phone, as I was trading it in, only to find out that their system was not working and would not be able to complete the transfer. The employee states he will leave my info with another employee and that I should come first thing the next morning to get everything done. I show up in the morning and no one knows who I am or about the night before. Wow. It took about half an hour but finally I was able to switch providers and get my new phone.  All of the employees seemed to be kind of clueless about things. They failed to mention my different options for cell phone insurance and only told me the option that was the most expensive. I am not sure if they were just wanting to get more money out of me or just wanting to rush through the transaction. Either way, not cool.   I suggest going to the chandler mall location.

I love it here. The staff is always friendly and pretty speedy. I go every morning before work for coffee. I love that some of the baristas even remember my order. I have the gold card so every 12th drink I get a free item. Who doesn't love starbucks? The only thing this location is lacking is a drive-thru. That would make it perfect!

Terrible service.   My fiancé and I ordered a product online. When arriving at the store, we were greeted by very overly cheerful people trying to push some new product on us.  Got to the counter for online pick up and was met with a woman who seemed to hate her life. She did not smile once the whole time. We needed to purchase a few more things in the store and asked her what would be easier for her, to either come back with the additional items or pick up the product now. She seemed a little angry and told us to come back after finding the extra items.  After shopping around a bit we arrived back at the online counter. The woman was gone and in her place two men. We told them we needed to pick up an item and purchase two additional products which we had brought to the counter. Apparently neither men could check out an online purchase. I wonder why they would stand at the counter for online pick up if they can't complete the transactions. They were very rude. We asked if we could pay for the other items. The guy who rang us up acted like he didn't even want to help us with the transaction. He was very short and once we paid he walked over a few feet to a different register and just stood there doing nothing while we waited for the only lady who can complete online orders. She finally came maybe 5-10 minutes later. Still hating life apparently.   Place needs new employees. Everyone is rude and unfriendly. Sticking to Lowes from now on.

I wish I got the woman's name who helped me yesterday! She was so super kind and helpful. I was able to find some super comfy maternity jeans that will hopefully last the rest of my pregnancy (20 more weeks) and lots of great bras! The woman also hooked me up with a free baby package with some coupons and samples. It was such a nice experience and she really made it great. The clothes are really nice quality and totally worth the extra bucks!

Love love love this place. I always order the red chili burrito, enchilada style with red sauce. Oh man, it's delicious! Prices and service are equally amazing! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!

I've only been here for the burger and beer deal but it is absolutely amazing! It's $5 for a burger, fries, and beer or soda. You have to pay extra for cheese but it's worth it! It's probably the best bar food I've had and such a great price! Plus, they have fireball shots. I'd recommend this place to anyone.

This place is really great! A favorite for my fiancé and I to go on date nights. The ribs are the most amazing ribs I have ever eaten! They are fall off the bone delicious! The Thai chicken and jasmine rice is my favorite meal. And the mashed potatoes, the best I have ever had! Seriously, super yummy food and beautiful atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend this place. Only warning: prices are a little on the high side so this restaurant is more for special occasions.

It's hard to find items. Products are organized in a very strange manner. Employees don't even know where things are.   The reason I will not be back to this location is the way an employee treated me today. I was having issues paying for my items at self checkout. The machine did not want to work. I had to wait several minutes for an employee to come and look at the machine. Finally when someone came, instead of coming to my station the woman goes to her little booth and yells across the way that my card is not working and I need to go get cash. I asked if I can be rung up at a different machine because I know nothing is wrong with my card. She shrugs me off. So then I have to pick up all my groceries that I just rang up myself and wait in line for another register. And what do you know my card worked. Just an FYI, if a customer's card is appearing to decline it might be wise to speak to the customer directly instead of yelling across the way so that everyone else can hear. And if it may be a register issue then why not help the person move their groceries to another machine. Just pure laziness.

I love that this place is family owned and decorated with family photos! The coffee is yummy and there is a ton of options to choose from. Service is great. If I lived closer I would be here more often but it's definitely a spot I'll come to when I'm in the neighborhood!

Heard such great reviews and was so excited to try their breakfast burritos this morning. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The burritos tasted more like egg than anything else. I couldn't even taste cheese that was supposed to be in there. It was just so bland and lacking that special flavor I was expecting. The green salsa was also blah. I was just not impressed with my entire order. Not as good as all the great reviews I have read and heard. I'll give it one more try to see if I just picked bad items on the menu but that's it! Grrrrrr!!

I absolutely love the atmosphere of this nail salon! All the nail techs are so friendly and welcoming. It's an awesome place. A little more pricey than my normal nail spots but you definitely get what you pay for.  Tips- Make an appointment. It gets pretty busy and seems hard to get seen if you just walk in.  They also don't accept tips on your debit or credit card so make sure to bring cash!

Great place for Sunday brunch. Just tried it out this past Sunday for the first time. I got a veggie and cheese crepe. Super yummy! My fiancé got the BLTA crepe which was delicious! And be also got the banana Nutella crepe. It was pretty good! I'll definitely be back for more. Wasn't too impressed with the iced coffee. I'll have to keep experimenting I guess!

Literally worst customer service ever.   My husband and I went through the drive thru. The woman asks if we want to try one of the chickens. We say no and say one moment to decide what to order. Once we have decided my husband starts speaking. Places the order & greeted with silence. He asks if she got all that. Still nothing. Then we reverse the car less than an inch and the woman says 'welcome to Panda Express, how may I take your order?'.  I am confused as to why she could not hear us when making the order the first time around but whatever. Midway through ordering she tells us to hold on then comes back and asks what we ordered again. Pulled up to the window to pay & get our food. The lady hands us our food and then walks away from the window. Does not say have a good night or even say good bye.   The food was fine. Seemed fresh and portion size was good. Obviously it's fast food chinese so not the best thing I've ever eaten in my life or anything.   But due to the terrible customer service I will not return to this location ever. Seriously if you don't like your job then quit. Is it really that bad to just be nice to customers? Obviously management doesn't care because looking at the other reviews this has been an ongoing problem that has not changed.

Loved it! It feels great to support local stores and eat quality food. I like that there are a few vegan vendors too.

Fun place to drink and have fun! There's a little dance floor and DJ which I really enjoy. There is also pool tables and poker for the non-dancers. The food is great, along with the service. I liked that there were individual TVs at the tables. Overall, a nice place to hang out with friends and eat some good food!

It's a nice place to socialize with friends, drink, and dance. Like most bars, drinks can be a little pricy but if you don't want to spend money on alcohol then stay home!   The food is a weak attempt at Mexican cuisine. The only thing I like eating there are the tacos on Tuesday.   Like many others I think the dress code is ridiculous. Why are guys not allowed to have stickers on their hats? Seems a little silly to me!   The staff is horrible. I almost always see the female servers flirting with the tables that have only men but neglect to check on my table when it's me and my boyfriend. The male servers are no better. One guy even said he would rate my friend and I as 'sevens'. I'm sorry but I don't go out to a bar for the staff to degrade me as a human being. I have no idea who he was or why that comment was even made. But after that I have not enjoyed going there as much.   The only thing I really enjoyed about this place is they sent out coupons for free beer. I loved using the coupon since no purchase was required.

I took my daughter to this park for the first time today. Since it was during the week, the train wasn't running but we still had lots of fun. It's a super pretty park with lots to do. You can feed the ducks, go fishing, and they have a few playgrounds for kids. My daughter loved the little splash pad that was there. I'll definitely be back on the weekend to ride the train!

If I could leave zero stars I would. This place is disgusting and has terrible service. While there I saw three bugs, one that was crawling on our table. It took forever for them to take our order and also to bring the food out. Ordered the red chili burrito & it was the worst thing I've ever had. Not sure how people think this is authentic mexican food. It tasted like crap. Not to mention how overly priced it was. I will not be going back there.   Thanks for ruining my night!!!!

Absolutely loved Jill. She is so welcoming and friendly. The whole experience was amazing. My husband and I went in for the early sneak peak gender reveal. Jill made the whole experience so special and we will definitely be back when I am around 30 weeks to see our precious baby again!

I didn't see one bad review on here and I think that says a lot! This place is awesome. I bought a groupon for $35 which got me unlimited classes for 5 weeks. I've been going at least 3-5 times each week. It's awesome. The trainers are great and know how to give you that little or big push that you need. They're friendly and informative. I was pretty much sold after the first week and will definitely sign up for the membership when my 5 weeks end.   I'd like to mention they do not try to sell you on the membership. A lot of gyms I've been to in the past are always trying to get you locked into some sort of contract. Not here though! The classes speak for themselves and the place has done awesome from more word of mouth than anything! Go check it out! Now!

Solid bagel spot. The bagels are really yummy and fresh. I got the sausage, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich. It was really good and super cheesy! The guy recommended not to toast the bagel since they were already freshly made and hot out of the oven! Really glad he did because it made the sandwich that much better.  I didn't give the place five stars because it was so small and got really busy. There isn't really any place to wait for your to go order. It took awhile for my sandwiches and then when I said the order was mine the guys tried giving it to someone else. Maybe they can take down names when calling out the orders instead or give out numbers.

This place sucked and I'm not surprised it has been shut down. I had only been there one time but it was such a horrible experience. I ordered a margarita. When I received my drink there was a bug in it! I told the server and she took the drink. I was given a new drink and the server says, 'hopefully there's no bugs in this one'. She didn't say sorry or comp the drink or anything. She was so rude and unprofessional that I never went back. I'm not trying to drink a buggy margarita!

I love coming here. I went for a free session saturday and loved it so much I signed up the same day. I blame the release of endorphins from the workout! The trainers are nice and friendly. I like learning different moves and being pushed to complete the workout. It's really motivating and I love the overall atmosphere.   There's a few things that could use improving. The front staff advised me I would get a free class if I brought a friend who had never been. I brought two friends but was still charged for the class. Also, the memberships are really expensive. I have the basic which is $59 for 4 classes a month. There's no way I could even afford an unlimited package! If it was a little more affordable I think I would like it even better.

Best donuts in town! You have to try the apple fritters! It is like heaven in your mouth.  The owners are always friendly.  The coffee and boba are also delicious.  Writing this review makes me want to go get a donut right now!

Nice place to get a yummy and healthy smoothie. They changed their hours and are now open at 7am, which is nice. I like getting a drink before work. The employees are super friendly and make quality food and drinks.   The only bad thing I have to say about this place is my experience with the wheat grass shot. It was fine going down until I got home. And then it all came back up. This didn't just happen to me but my two friends as well. It took me awhile to go back after that experience.   Stick with the juices & smoothies and you should be just fine.

Perfect lil spot for some yummy burritos! So far I have tried the bean and cheese burrito, sausage breakfast burrito, and carne asada California burrito. All were delicious! The restaurant is clean and pretty big compared to most burrito shops. The employees are nice and friendly. Salsa is good and spicy. Prices are affordable. Plus they are open pretty late which is hard to find in ahwatukee! I'm so happy to have this place close to home.

Food is decent. Might be back because I saw a few more vegan options on the menu. The staff is horrible. Terrible customer service. My food was ready but the front girls didn't notice because they were too busy eating cake and gossiping. Had to wait an extra 5-10 minutes because of them and all I ordered was hummus and pita.

So this Walmart offers online grocery shopping. Basically you order all your groceries online, select the time you would like to pick them up, park in the designated spot at the store and the employees will bring it out to you. It's pretty much the best service I have ever heard of. Plus, if they don't have something you ordered but have it in a bigger size they will upgrade the product free of charge. This service is free and AMAZING! Not to mention, the employees I dealt with were the nicest Walmart employees I have ever met. If you haven't tried it out yet, I suggest you do so right now! That is all.

This place is awesome! I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special and was surprised with how much food you get! Everything was delicious. I really enjoyed the peanut sauce used for the salad! I also tried the Thai tea. That stuff is amazing! If I lived closer I would be here all the time. Plus, this place has incredible customer service. I can't wait to eat here again.
