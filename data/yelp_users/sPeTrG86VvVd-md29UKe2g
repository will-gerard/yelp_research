Absolutely NO guest PARKING here!   You are forced to Valet Park your car:(  and if you stay too late, they move your car across town and you will never find it until the next day!  be extremely careful when you patronize this establishment!  Do Not hand your keys to anyone!!  You have been warned!!   But they do have good food!

Horrible valentine dinner!!  Took my daughter to Armitage and ordered the Valentine special for two!  A cheap cold fish plate and a cold fatty strip steak. Sent them both back. My daughter said they were too cold  to eat. They finally served them hot. Said they were having a BAD night in the kitchen. I have never stiffed a waiter but this guy needed to be fired. He pissed off at least three tables!  And the blonde manager was a bitch to say the least. I was overcharged for two drinks and the milk desert was trash!  God help this place. It is a cluster!!  Way the hell over priced for trash food. You have been warned!!  Please tell Mac the owner that he has trouble on his hands!!  Never again for me or my friends !!

I always request Cory at Maxon Air,  because he knows his business and services my old 1987 heat pumps and keeps em running for me.  Knowledgeable friendly  and reasonably priced...  but i do agree with him, nothing like a new 410 Hvac System to make your AC run smoothly, without a breakdown..  thx  cory!
