This is home for Phoenix Suns, love everything here.  All signs are clear and staffs are friendly and knowledgeable.  Parking has been the problems since sometimes it's difficult finding a close lots.  But you do get to ride the light rail for free for all events being held at USAC.

Went there an hour ago to purchase a battery for my boss' vehicle, my boss paid cash for it and waited for the change from the employee there, but nothing happened because the employee doesn't want to give the change back to my boss.  If you do go there, DO NOT purchase anything from Veronica.  She's the most dishonest employee ever.  She acted all sweet and nice in the beginning, but later she lied about it.  Be wise about it, go shop somewhere else for better services.

Love the cheap gas there compare to all other major brand gas stations.  Their gas station usually close an hour after the actual store closes.  If you want some cheap gas and don't want to wait in line, go fill up either very early or after 8pm on weekdays.  After all, this is the biggest warehouse store in the world, why not check it out if you haven't done so in a while.  Have fun shopping!

Anything you can think of that has to do with baking, this is the place to be.  They have everything you are looking for and need.  Boxes, decorations, candles, and supplies.  Their prices are very reasonable too.  If you own a store, make sure you apply for their resale program where  you can get almost everything at the resale price w/o paying for taxes.  For boxes, if you get the bulk sizes, you will save even more.  I've been shopping from them for about 2 years now and I can't think of any other places where I would get all my baking supplies.

Either they need to hire more baristas or they need to work in faster pace.  I ordered a very simple drink and waited for over 5 minutes for it.  It was also during evening rush hours, but that shouldn't be the reason why my drink took a long time to make.  Not impressed at all.

Great place and good food, but parking is the main issue why I don't usually come here after 6pm because you can hardly find a spot here.  Food was okay, they have HH menu for half priced of their Munchies menu.  I ordered Black Pepper Calamari, the taste was good, but it wasn't worth the half price they charged me.  The portion wasn't big at all, so I wouldn't recommend you order that dish.  I ordered one of their burgers that I couldn't remember the name.  It was very tasty and the sides come from many choices, including sweet potato fries.  Not many places offer this options and of course I picked it.  However I think I got food poison from this place, but I doubt that I'll return here again any time soon.

Came here for a seminar.  Surprised to see this place still exist as this location is very old and the hotel is in need of a remodel.  Good thing about Embassy Suites is that all their rooms are suite style and they offer free breakfast each day and free Happy Hour from 5pm - 7pm daily.  Not going back again until they remodel their looks.

Greatest bank in Arizona.  It's privately owned and operated.  When you use their ATM card at any other banks' ATM machines, they will reimburse you the fees back to you.  You might see a fee charged when you take the money out of the ATM, but that charge will not show on your statements.  They are currently remodeling this branch right now so you might see some dusts flying when you walk in, but that won't be long.  Great bank and great employees, this is what banking is all about.  They even open on Sundays too, can't beat that.

Went there last night to get my home key made.  Saw a uniformed Phoenix Police officer in the store.  Not sure if this is a one-time thing or they always have an officer on-duty.  But overall service was great and fast.  Definitely a place to go to for all your hands on projects.

Stopped by this branch this morning on my way to work.  Strike a conversation with one of the African-American lady teller.  She asked if I am a BofA customer or not and I told her used to, but not anymore, just making a payment for someone else.  She asked who I bank with and I told her Chase Bank and MidFirst Bank and she asked why I'm no longer BofA customer, I told her that the customer service I had were bad and she asked if Chase is better, I told her yes, and she was surprised to hear that.  I'm surprised that she would think BofA customer service would be better than Chase.  One bad thing about this branch is one of the male teller was picking his nose and teeth at the same time while I was there.  Seriously?  You would do that at the open window bank?  I was originally giving this branch a 3 star, and because of that, I'm now giving it 2 star because of the employee appearance.  Another bad thing about this branch is that there's no drive-thru window teller, they do however have 3 lanes of drive-thru ATM's and one walk-up ATM by the main entrance.  Good location, that's all that's good.

I always make my trip to OfficeMax first before I try anywhere else.  This store is in a great location near 44th St. & Thomas Rd. in Phoenix near the airport.  They have great selections on all the office products.  Binders, papers, markers, and anything and everything you can think of.  They also have great prices as well.  If you need to price-match from Staples, Walmarts, Target, and/or any stores, just bring in their ads and show it to the employees, they will gladly match the prices, sometimes even cheaper too.  Check them out before you go to other places.

After a long day of work, both my friend and I need something for dinner, so we head to Chicago Hamburger Co.  My friend has been wanting to take me there for a long time, so I said sure, why not?  When we got there, it was just a bit before 7pm and it wasn't very crowded.  I ordered the daily special, which was the Grilled Bratwurst w/ Fries or Cole Slaw.  My friend ordered the Chili Dog with Garlic Fries.  The garlic tasted really thick and both of us weren't really a fan, but the fries was absolutely great.  It was very crispy and fresh, not of those frozen fries you get at other fast food joints.  The bratwurst is good, but could be bigger.  The chili sauce is good too.  I would definitely go back and try their other daily specials whenever I'm going to be in the neighborhood the next time.  Good food, I'll definitely be bringing my friends over next time.

This review is solely on the sales department ~  So it has been about 10 years since I last purchased a vehicle.  I have had 2 Nissans, 2 Acuras, and none Toyota/Lexus that I want to give it a try.  So I stopped by Bell Lexus North Scottsdale right down the street from my house.  I thought since this dealership moved from Phoenix to Scottsdale, their attitudes would be better and have higher quality of service, oh, was I totally wrong about this.  To begin the whole process, I've been in communication with one of their customer service rep over the Internet about what I want in my car, we kept writing e-mails back and forth to each other with the changes and exactly what I'm looking for.  One day on my day off, I stopped by the dealership for the first time.  There wasn't many people looking in their lot, one of the sales rep came out and I told him I was looking for a gal which would remain nameless because it's not important in this case.  Then this gal introduced me to the product specialist that serves as sales rep as well.  He went through everything with me, trying to find me the color that I had previous talked to this gal about, and then he told me, I'm sorry, but the car you want is no longer available to you.  So I asked to see another similar vehicle and asked for a test drive.  He said he'll drive the car off the lot and let me drive the rest of the way.  I thought he meant he'll just drive the car out of the dealership and park it at the near-by street for me to take over.  No, he drove the car for like 5 minutes and about 2 miles away from the dealership before letting me take control of the vehicle.  What type of test drive was that?  Is he afraid that I might wrack the car or he is not sure if I know how to handle a Lexus?  Back to the dealership after the worst test drive ever, we sat down to talk numbers.  He talked to his manager while I sat at his desk waiting for him.  He would not give me the final cost on how much I would need to pay, instead, he asked for $3,000 to locate the car that I requested with the gal earlier from another dealership.  Seriously, why the heck do you think I would give you $3,000 to locate the car for me when you can't even give me the final number on the car.  You can't be serious.  That's not how you want people to buy car from you.  Instead I think they are driving people away from their dealership since people are very afraid to go shop there.  I have purchased the vehicle I want from Earnhardt Scottsdale Lexus.  Seriously people, STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.

Took my car to Discount Tire to get new tires.  After the installation, the tech told me about my wheel lock stud being broken on the rear left side, so he gave me a piece paper with Network Alignment & Brakes name and phone number on it telling me to call them and they'll fix the wheel lock for free.  I called yesterday afternoon asking how long will it take to fix the issue, the guy on the phone said with appointment, about 45 minutes.  So I set-up the appointment for this morning and I arrived few minutes early, and I was greeted right away.  The whole process took less than 20 minutes.  What an awesome job they did.

So far the best insurance prices compare to other companies.  They are friendly and very knowledgeable and will not try to get your businesses by lying to you and trying to say nice thing to get you sign-up.  Check them out if you are in the markets of researching for better quality insurance company.

Used to come to this library often while I was in school.  Haven't come here many times after 2007.  But still come here once or twice just to vote for City of Phoenix elections.  Very good location right by PV Mall and near SR-51 and Loop-101.  I believe the city cut the library hours, so this location doesn't even open on Fridays anymore.  But I would agreed on the good librarians working in the library.

Great service.  They won't try to sell you anything that you don't need.  If you prefer to have a different types of tires that goes to your vehicle, they will tell you why and why not it works or don't work on the car.  They want what's best for your vehicle.  They don't work on commissions, so feel free to ask as many questions as you possibly have.  I recently bought 4 tires for 2 of my vehicles for the President's Day special.  It's good deal when you know what you are doing.  Give them a try if you haven't done it before.  I know I'll go back again for more of their great services.

Not really sure why everyone are giving bad reviews on Sprint.  Yes, the talk coverage are small and bad, I get that, I complain to them all the time too, but there's nothing we can do to change that, so deal with it. I am all for the unlimited data coverages.  Most of us don't own a laptop anymore, so we are on our phone 24/7.  I watched movies, listen to radios, check my e-mails and etc, I used it everyday and it goes over to the 2GB mark every cycles, and my speed is still the same, sometimes faster too. I come to this place for any technical problems I have with my phone.  I used to have the BlackBerry Curve 8330 and it causes problems all the time, I came here for solutions and they usually fix it right away within 48 hours after I dropped off my phone. I've been with Sprint since 2000, I have my ups and downs with them.  But be patient, none of the phone providers out there are perfect.  You have to invest your time and money to find out what's good and what's not.  Good luck!

They have now removed both drive-thru lanes due to not enough people using them.  I asked one of the teller inside why it was removed and she told me because there are many other ways to deposit the money instead and they don't have to staff tellers there anymore.  Guess it can be good and bad at the same time.  They still have a armed security guard standing outside the entrance.

This place is crazy busy this morning when I visited.  I was only there to purchase their gift card as there's a sign on the window when I walked in.  I usually shop there at least once a week for their fresh produces and some booze to go with it.  Their cashiers are friendly and knowledgeable and can answer your questions right away.  Definitely coming back again for their great service and great location just across the streets from Paradise Valley Mall.

Went there after hearing about the Arizona Cardinals promotion, if the Cards won, you get a free medium coffee the day after the game.  Well, I went, didn't know about the app for the smart phone.  Was told that I need the app and the phone wasn't with me.   Didn't get the coffee, walked away unhappy.

Flew this airline once when I was flying from PHX to PDX (Portland, Oregon).  Really enjoyed my flight experience.  This airline flies out of Terminal 2, which is the first terminal once you are off from I-10.  Easy parking access and literally walk right in to the security check-point.  Will definitely try again if I'm going to the PNW area again.

I enjoy my time shopping at this Target while I was in the area after dinner.  And since I used to work in the area on 48th St. & Chandler Blvd., I know the area quiet well.  This store is very bright and all their aisles are very clean.  The store sells everything from your household goods like electronics items from TV or cell phones to your home fridge need such as dry good, ice cream, yogurt, milk, and eggs.  I don't believe that this store is a 24-hour store, so better call the store first before heading out.  Don't want you to come all the way out to the store and then find out they are closed for the night.

Love the food, especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily, never frozen potatoes.  Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers.  It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!

I'm not an Audi owner yet, but if you do own an Audi and need to bring your vehicle(s) in for any type of services, make sure you check-in with Mike Franklin.  I've worked with Mike for over an year while he was a service consultant with Acura North Scottsdale few doors down.  He is very knowledgeable with any types of services and he'll help you until the matters closed.  He can be reached at MFranklin@penskeautomotive.com.  I will definitely service my vehicle with Mike when I officially becomes an Audi owner in the near future.

Ordered The Tower Burger for my birthday, up to $10 value, just pay the difference if your food is greater than that.  Love the special sauces.  The burger was too big so I had to cut it in half.  It was super busy as well since it's on Thanksgiving weekend.  I didn't know I have to order first and get a seat so I was a bit confused there but good thing I was there with my friends and not by myself.  I live in North Scottsdale and it was worth the drive for me to drive all the way down to Downtown Gilbert.  Definitely coming back again soon.

Great location, right next to Hilton Resort on the SEC of Scottsdale Rd. & Lincoln Dr. in Scottsdale. This location is much smaller than the other locations, and the noise level was actually too loud for me as this is a very special celebration for me and my date.  Both my date and I ordered the Bone-In Rib Eye steaks.  The steaks were very juicy and moist and it turned out perfect and it melted in your mouth.  Our waiter was Justin and he and his assistant were both very helpful answering our questions as this was our first time visiting this location.  We had to shout out loud to get our waiters' attention due to the noises surrounding our table. Once we finished with our meal, one of the manager, Tracy, stopped by our table to make sure their services meets our standard.  But overall, this was a great choice on both of our parts and we'll definitely return to this place again soon for another celebration.

And they don't accept appointments, but you may call ahead and request your favorite hair stylist in advance if you prefer.

Love this place.  I was so surprised to see Larry there when I walked into the shop.  I used to go to the store on Hayden, but I called today to see how long the wait time will be at the Hayden location, they said about 2 hours, then I called this store and Larry answered the phone letting me know the wait time is only about an hour.  Came in today thinking I may need a new brake service down since it has been so long, according to Larry's technicians, I had about 10% left on my brake pads, rotors are still okay, so not a big deal there.  Larry offered me a discount as I always take my cars (3 of them at home) to BM for all brakes need.  He truly care about his customers and will do whatever necessary to get the job down.  One great thing about this company is that they offer you Free Wi-Fi within their shops.  Password is display at their counter or just any one of them for those info, they got nothing to hide.  Definitely come and check them out.

Scheduled my appointment online, fast and easy.  Used to go to the one on Scottsdale Rd., they closed that one down, guess 2 stores within 1 mile of each other isn't good for businesses.  They are trained to replace your tires and wheels and nothing else, so you know you will get the highest quality of helps from them and they won't try to sell you anything that you don't need.  They will recommend you the products and never be pushy about it.  One thing they need to improve is to maybe have a free Wi-Fi service.  But do give them a chance if you have never come here before!

Typical Italian restaurant.  Even thought it's a chain store, the food is still good and not water down like some other fancy restaurants.  Since they no longer associate with Red Lobster, you won't be able to use Red Lobster's gift cards at Olive Gardens anymore.  They don't take expired coupons at this location either.  They serve unlimited soup or salad and bread sticks with any purchases, so eat up.

This is my first time actually purchasing the paint with Dunn-Edwards.  I have heard about this place through the painters that repainted our house few years ago that they purchased the paints through them.  If you do live in a Homeowner Association home(s), just provide your association name to them and most likely you will get some soft of a discounts on all the purchases.  Good luck!

Great place to get your tire fix, they check your air pressure for free, I go to them once every 3 months.  They gave good quotes and compare their prices with other tire companies.  Make sure you make appointments with them for your services or you will be waiting up to 2 hours to get your tire rotations.

Bank of America need to retrain all of their employees.  They aren't doing what they are suppose to do and they are doing it very slowly.  Went there on a Friday afternoon, only 2 tellers working the front.  Very many people and yet the tellers are talking to each other and not really helping the customers.  I guess they really don't care if their clients gets help or not.  Guess it's time for me to change bank now.

I'm having some A/C issues recently since the A/C isn't blowing out cold air anymore, it's now just cool air.  So I took it to Brake Masters since they check your system free of charge other than just the brakes.  After a few hours, one of the managers told me what needs to be done first before they can tell me what's going on.  I gave him the okay to go for it, and after another hour or so, he told me what he needs to do and how much is going to charge me, after I consult with the vehicle owner, I gave him the okay to do it.  I had something to do that afternoon, so I went to do it and when it's all fixed, received the call from the manager and everything is all good and all taken care of.  Very honest and professional company, glad that I choose Brake Masters.  Would definitely recommend to anyone that needs service on their vehicle(s).

Not really sure why everyone are all giving bad reviews about this store.  I enjoyed going to shop at this store as the employees won't rush me into making a decision right away on any products.  They actually listen to what I need and offer any help I asked for.  I would definitely go back to this location whenever I need help with my Sprint phone.

Okay branch.  No drive-thru window, only drive-thru ATM.  Two ATM's outside the branch side-by-side.  Forever to do my deposits as the tellers are working very slowly.  I think I'll skip this branch from now on.

I used to come here all the time when I was a student at ASU.  They have this very cool study room inside a vault.  I believe this used to be a bank or something, very nice.  Restrooms are outside, you will need to get a key from the register area.  Free wi-fi so you can do all your study or gaming.   Great staff and good coffee, stop by the next time you are in the area.

Great place.  Lots of selections.  The only Fry's I know in Tempe that opens until 1am.  Always a hit with students from the near by ASU since the other closest grocery store, Safeway, closes at midnight.

I've been having some problems with my tires being low on air, so I stopped by this Discount Tire after my lunch meeting at the nearby golf course.  I stopped in and tell the guy what was going on and he told me to go get my tire pressure checked by one of his tech.  It turns out that I just need 2 new tires and everything worked out fine.  I left with 2 brand new tires and I'm very happy with their service and their attitude about everything.  They don't try to sell you something that you don't need and they will always give you a honest opinion for you to decide later on.

I missed America West Airlines, all the good services went down once US Airways took over.  Meh, I think I'll pass.  The only reason I gave a 2-star is because this is still the hometown airline from Phoenix, but not for much longer.

Cheapest airlines out there.  No checked bags fee, up to two per flight per person.  No change fee, only need to pay the difference in fares.  Fly to almost anywhere and everywhere in the U.S.  First come, first serve seats, you do however need to check-in at least 24 hours in advanced before your departure date for best seats.  The flight attendants are always happy and actually love their jobs.  They will give you whole can of soft drinks if you ask for it, and they would gladly give you unlimited free refills if you ask nicely.  One bad thing about this airline is that they don't have any international flights, especially to Canada and/or Mexico.

Great pricing and location.  Right off SR-51 & I-17 on the corner of Bethany Home Rd. & 19th Ave.  I've been bowling here for about 5 years now on the Monday night league team.  I love everyone that works there, especially John, he's always very friendly and will help you figure everything out if you ever have any questions.

I've been to a lot of Brake Masters, and this location has the biggest waiting room in all of my visits, not really sure why.  I took my friend's car to get the brakes check out before she's not sure when the last time she had the service done.  After waiting in-store for about an hour to get it check-out, the technician told me that the brakes need to be fix.  So I let the tech go ahead with the job after I got permission from my friend to do that job.  They knew that I've been out and about and is tired so they did their very best to finish the jobs ahead of time so I could leave.  I will go back there again to do the brake job.  They also fix other problems most of the dealerships do, so if you need a second opinions, make sure to stop by there and you maybe be able to save a few bucks.

Love this place.  Try my best to come here at least twice every year for both the Scottsdale Arts Festival (March) and Scottsdale Culinary Festival (April).  All the staffs here are very friendly, nice, and very knowledgeable on everything arts related.  I've been volunteering for this place for a long time, close to 10 years.  Great place to be at.  And it's in Old Town Scottsdale too.  Can't go wrong with that.

My work needed some professional printing done, so we went seeking help on Yelp and found out that The Printing Co. has the one of the best review out of many other printing companies in Metro Phoenix area.  To make the story short, we dealt with Larry directly all via e-mail communications and he's very professional and he took time to show us what our options are and how much it cost to print this and that.  The turnaround time was a bit long because we needed a special paper to print what we needed, but overall quality and services are just outstanding.  I would definitely recommend you to go check out The Printing Co., you won't be disappointed.

Went there tonight for my friend Renee's birthday.  Got there around 5:45pm and it was already packed.  Left my name with the Host up front and took a number, waited for over 30 minutes for a table, but it was totally worth it.  Our server (Robyn) was great, she was very knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  The prices were okay, since I went during Happy Hour time, it was cheaper.  Make sure you plan your trip early if you decide to go there next time.  The best time to go if during lunch-time (12pm - 3pm) if you don't care about the costs.

Great location in the heart of Paradise Valley, just minutes from Phoenix and Scottsdale.  Great place for any wedding photos especially since this place is right by the Camelback Mountain.  This property is part of the JW Marriott Hotel so you know you will be getting a great service from all the staffs.  Haven't had a chance of staying here yet, was only here for the BLT Steakhouse Happy Hour food.

My Internet speed is running slow, so I stopped by this new location to check it out and see maybe I can upgrade my plan if the price is reasonable.  Talked with Xaiver, he didn't try to sell me anything and he listened to the problems I have.  So closed on leaving Cox and go with some other companies.  Walked out a happier customer.  Checked out the new store.  Bigger, brighter, and more counters and samples for you to see what you can get for the prices.  They partnered up with Verizon Wireless too.

Very cheap gas prices compare to where I live and work.  It's right off I-10 & Chandler Blvd. between Ahwatukee & Chandler.  Very clean and has a lot of lighting, so you won't have to fear your life for being robbed.  This place is open 24/7 so you can stop by anytime you want.

Took my vehicle to this shop after one of my co-worker recommended me to their shop saying how great the tech can do magic on the job.  Well, 3 weeks later and thousands of dollars gone after them "kidnapped" my vehicle without any communications whatsoever, my car is finally done.  Hopefully he actually fixed the car.  I don't think that's how you are suppose to do for business.  Before every job(s), you are suppose to contact the vehicle owner to see if we approve and/or disapprove the job, well, I didn't get anything from this shop at all.  Every time we tried to contact the tech, he is nowhere to be found.  We had to contact someone else to get the message to him.  This is not the way of doing business especially if you want me to recommend anyone we know to you for more businesses.  This will not happen ever after the stunt you pulled by fixing my vehicle.  I don't know why everyone are saying such a great thing about this shop when they can't even answer and return their phone calls.  If I can give a 1/2 star to this shop I would, but the minimum I am allow to give is one star, so that's all I'm getting.  Make sure you do your research on the shops you are taking your vehicle(s) to get it fixed next time.  I know I will think deep and hard the next time something is wrong with my vehicle.  I will never take my vehicle here ever again.  Good luck!

Good place to go if you a fans of Irish type of beer and/or any types of dark/thick beer.  I can't really handle the dark beer so I tend to not go there if I don't have to.  They do charge covers to get in, so be sure to shell some more of your beer money for that, usually $10 and a long line especially on the weekends.  I would rather save my money for somewhere else.

Best place to watch any Broadway shows.  I'm a little bias as I am a lifelong Sun Devil and earned a degree from ASU.  I will have to agree that this place needs a little bit renovation inside and out, but it's still a great place to watch a show or two.  Parking could be an issue before and after, but I have no problem with that, always get there a bit early and leaving a bit later.  No complains.

Best place to window shop, or really do some damage to your bank accounts.  It's the best indoor mall in Arizona where there are a lot of stores to go for.  Parking will definitely be an issue around all holidays, especially Thanksgiving and Christmas.  But no need to worry since some of the stores offer valet services so you can leaving the parking problems to them and go on enjoy your shopping spree.  This mall even have a movie theatre and there's another one within walking distance nearby the mall for some smaller title movies.  Check them out the next time you are in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale!

I go there for their food.  I know I know, it's a furniture store, but their food choices are much more appealing and all the prices you see are tax included.  It's a huge place to walk through.  Make sure you sign-up to be part of the IKEA Family where you sometimes can get discounts on the food choices at their cafeteria upstairs.

Home of the Arizona Cardinals & Fiesta Bowl during College Football Playoff in December/January of each year.  And most recently, Super Bowl #SB49.  It's a great experience to be in and around the stadium.  I'm not sure if they are still doing tours of the stadium, but if there's ever a chance to do that, make sure you do it.

Came here for my free birthday meal up to $10 value.  Anything over $10, you just pay the differences.  Make sure you show your Photo ID when ordering and it's only available on the day of your birthday, not before nor after.  I got the sampler plus 2 sides.  Good flavor everything, and the sides are delicious as well.  Make sure you go early as one of the sampler I want ran out so they substitute another choice for me.  You can either order from the side walk or go into the store, same service and very friendly.

I go there at least twice a month for my Kiwanis meeting.  We started meeting there back in the days in 2007.  All the servers are extremely friendly, we know the owners very well since they just been inducted as Honorary Member of my Kiwanis Club.  If you want some cheap food and drinks, they have a $1.50 hamburger on Wednesdays, and lots of 2-4-1 deals on Friday and Saturday nights.  They also have a lot of TV's inside for different sports.  College hoops, college footballs, NFL, NHL, NBA, and MLB.  Definitely worth your time checking out the place.

The service of this location is getting worse.  Came here on a not so busy Sunday night, our server was Sean S., he wasn't really attentive after delivering our food.  I ordered the clam chowder which came hot.  And I also order a medium cooked Black Truffle Cheeseburger with regular fries.  The fries tasted cold and soggy.  The burger was medium warm and some of my meat was burned which it was the medium cooked as I asked for.  We were thirsty so we were waiting for refills, he preferred to flirt with ladies instead of serving other people.  I think next time I will go to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location instead.

Don't really think I should give a government office a 5-star.  I'm not saying that they don't do a good job, I just don't think a rate is necessary.  But I do enjoy the quick in-n-out of this place.  Best time to go is in the morning when they opened.  Worst time to go is in the afternoon during lunch time where there are  a lot of people and not enough employees.  Good thing about this location is that they open until 9pm on weekdays and open for half day on Saturdays.

I purchased my current phone (Samsung Galaxy S2) at this location after it was on sale online.  Reserved it online and pick it up in the store without any problems.  This store doesn't have a repair center, so you will have to drive to another store for any troubleshoots.  This store is between a popular restaurant and a law office.  The store is very small, but at least you'll actually get some service and help from the employees.

First time at this location, the store looked like brand new and very big.  They have these very cool hand-held scanners where you take it with you after you scan your either AMEX or Costco cards and scan your products then put it into your cart.  Once you are ready to check-out, you give your own scanner to the cashier and you pay at a separate check-out stand.  Very easy process and very cool.  It is near Loop-202 and Chandler Blvd. in Chandler.

This is my favorite grocery store to go to in the Ahwatukee neighborhood, I shop here more often than Safeway across the street.  Fry's have much better selections than Safeway in all department.  I especially love the beer section where you can mix and match 6 bottles of different type of beer and they always have the domestic beer that I like.  The front line people, mostly the cashiers work fast pace and I'm usually out of the store from checking out and paying in less than 5 minutes.  Definitely a store to shop at when you are in the area.

I shop here all the time as this is very close to my house.  It's huge, it's one of the biggest marketplace in Metro Phoenix.  They also have a shaded parking area but it's first come first serve and by the time I got there, it's all full.  They also offer free valet service.  This place is huge and you can spend a lot of time here.  This store used to be 24 hours, but they changed it because not that many people were shopping at 3 in the morning.  It's still good, but I wish they would open until late night maybe until 1 or 2 in the morning.  Good place, check it out if you are ever in the area.

The most weird location of the Fry's store.  Tucked in the very back of the cross streets.  They have security guard there that must hate their job.  The security guard doesn't have the proper dress code, the shirt and pants doesn't match at all.  I just stopped by there to get a gift card, doubt that I'll go back again.

I've bank with Chase Bank for 5+ years already and I really enjoy using all Chase ATM's.  There are 2 drive-thru ATM's and 1 ATM inside the branch.  You will need to have your Chase ATM Card in order to use the ATM at the lobby after normal business hours.  I like that idea which it will keep non-Chase customers away from the bank.

How can you say anything bad about Discount Tire?  They check your tires for free, they event fix the flat or if you have a small hole in your tires.  Unlike Sears and/or any other places, they charge you for the service and you don't even get the money back if you purchase tires from them.  I usually go to Discount Tire once every 3 months to check my air pressures, you are in and out in under 5 minutes.  Feel free to compare between Costco, Sam's Club, and Discount Tire.  I know for sure that you'll come here!

I've known Misty since 2002 while we were both students at Arizona State University, Go Devils.  She's very knowledgeable at what she does.  If she does not know an answer, she will call either her district manager or Allstate to get the answers answered right away.  she's a type of person that you can count on, and if you choose her to be your insurance agent, you can definitely count on her.  She's a very honest and trustworthy person.  If you are ever in need of help, she'll do whatever she can to be there for you and to take care of you and/or your family.  Give her a call today and find how how much you can save by switching your insurance to Allstate!

Cheapest airlines out there.  No checked bags fee, up to two per flight per person.  No change fee, only need to pay the difference in fares.  Fly to almost anywhere and everywhere in the U.S.  First come, first serve seats, you do however need to check-in at least 24 hours in advanced before your departure date for best seats.  The flight attendants are always happy and actually love their jobs.  They will give you whole can of soft drinks if you ask for it, and they would gladly give you unlimited free refills if you ask nicely.  One bad thing about this airline is that they don't have any international flights, especially to Canada and/or Mexico.

I only come here when my car is hungry.  Many pumps to use, but sometimes it does get busy and you will have to wait for an available station.  The prices here are usually very low compare to other gas stations.  Definitely a plus as it's right off SR-51 with easy access to everywhere.  Never been inside the store so really have nothing to comment on it.

I enjoy banking with Chase Bank as this is my home bank.  One of the drive-thru ATM doesn't work as it can't read my debit card, so I had to use the other ATM to do my transaction.  Overall service was good.  There's a Safeway grocery store near-by, so it's in a great location.

Great cheap homemade Chinese comfort food ... Very easy to get to and the owners there are very nice to everyone.  They talk with you see how your days are and make sure everything is good in your life.  Overall service was excellent, it's right off the light-rail stop too in Mesa!

Been shopping here ever since moving into the neighborhood in 1996, love everything in the store.  The veggies and fruits are always so fresh, and the bakery goodies are as good as any other privately owned bakery shops.  One thing that I am not a fan of this store is that there is never a good cell reception once you entered the store, but other than that, this is as good as it gets.  All the employees and managers are so friendly, if you saw anything that needs to be corrected, make sure you tell someone and they will usually fix it right away or make sure it gets fixed the next day.  I would definitely recommend this store to anyone that just move into the neighborhood.

Great location in South Scottsdale near Tempe, friendly staff and you don't have to wait over 5 minutes for your drinks.  They do have a drive-thru lane if you don't want to get out of your car during hot summer weather or cold winter weather.  Sometimes you might not be able to enter the store from Scottsdale Rd. as there's a bus stop right next to the entrance.  Overall a great location in Scottsdale.

Love this branch.  Since I live right down the street, I come to this branch as often as I can be.  This location used to be a 2-story restaurant / night club when the neighborhood was in development.  But since this is a family community, the business didn't do all that good so it was closing and then later I learned that it's going to be a Chase Bank and I was so happy that there's finally going to be a Chase Bank in my neighborhood.  I used to have to drive all the way to Tatum Blvd. & Bell Rd.  The only bad thing about this branch is that there aren't any safe deposit boxes so I will have to go to another branch for that service.  Overall services was great.  Definitely recommend you to visit this branch if you are in this area.

To be honest, I came here just for the free birthday meal every year.  I live way too far to be driving down here just for the yummy and delicious food.  Service was great and the food is just excellent.  I try to order different things from the menu and I usually order something else and not just get the free food and leave.  Great family tradition, thanks.  Now I just wish they can open up another location up north.

Love the food here, everything is so freshly made here from scratch.  Even thought this is a vegetarian paradise and I'm not a vegetarian at all, I still enjoy coming to eat at this place.  I would only come here when I have coupons because without the coupons, it's a little bit too expensive for me.  Overall service was good.

My usual orders, 1 hamburger with grilled onions, 2 fries, and 1 cup of water.  Totally love their fresh cut fries, all food here have never been frozen and it's fresh daily.  Love their fast services, however, you might have to wait a bit longer during lunch time and afternoon rush hours.  But it's totally worth the wait.  They also have a secret menu food that you'll have to ask them to make for you.  Try it out!

Love this place as this shopping center has some of my favorite shops.  For examples, Best Buy, Ulta, Sprint, GAP, Target, Harkins, and many more just to name a few.  They have concerts here during summer time near the stage area, great place to bring the kids out for them to play or for adults here to people watch.

Great place to hang out if you are waiting for a table at the Pizzaria Bianco next door.  I ordered a Cream Ale draft, they were out of Hefweizen, so I had to order the next light beer on tap.  There are 4 beers on tap at the time.  The beer was very smooth and tasty from a brand new keg.  Overall, the service was good, they don't have a lot of staff so the service wait time might be long if you go during their Happy Hour period.  Parking is a big issue, especially for Downtown Phoenix where there are a lot of events during night time and with ASU Downtown Campus nearby.  If you live in the neighborhood, the best way to get there is to be on foot so you won't have to worry about drinking and driving.

This place is crazy busy every time I went.  If you don't make a reservation and just show up expecting to be seated in more than an hour wait.  Always call ahead if you know what time you will be there or you'll be waiting forever.  Make sure you join their Chef's Table for $30 gift certification for your birthday.  They recently changed their rules, so make sure you bring someone else with you to the dinner before you can use the birthday certificate(s).

This is a very busy place for high school kids since the restaurant is open until 1am in the morning.  Great place to hang out with friends for quick bites to eat.  My usual order is 1 hamburger with grilled onions, 2 fries, and cup of water.  Haven't tried the secret menu or any animal style food yet, but heard that they were even better than the original food.  All food were never frozen before, so everything is fresh, especially the fresh cut fries with a bit seasoned salt on it.  Excellent meal and great and fast service every time I go there.

Best time to come here is either right after they open or come right before they are going to close.  If you come during lunch time, you'll be waiting anywhere up to 30 minutes.  They accept either cash or credit card, not sure about check as I've never pay with one before.

Stopped by here for a friend's going away party.  We all decided on Happy Hour because that's what we enjoyed doing.  We got there around 6ish and there wasn't too many people in the bar area.  we had a great turnout, about 20 of us showed up for the celebration.  I ordered Grilled Calamari and BLT Camelback Burger.  The calamari was okay, it didn't have a big portion like I hope, but I loved their special sauce.  The burger is whole other story, while the Angus beef tasted excellent, the buns holding the meat looked a bit odd, it's a flat bread type with poppy seeds on top of the bun.  It actually hold the meat quiet nicely, surprising to say that at least.  Overall I had a good experiences in this steak house inside a Marriott Hotel.  Can't wait to come back again for another try of other great Happy Hour menu choices.

I haven't stay here yet because I live only 10 minutes from the resort.  I come here a lot for business networking and meetings.  All the staffs here are very friendly and they will help you in any way they can.  The restaurant food are good too especially if you are on the go and need to grab a quick lunch.  The resort offers valet service or you may park your car at their underground facility.

Not a bad place to go for cheap Mexican food.  Started coming here last year.  It would be good if you order in Spanish, but English would do just fine.  Great place to be at after a long night of drinking too.  This isn't the safest area in the neighborhood, but the food is good, so I'm not complaining.

Stopped by here yesterday morning on my way to Glendale for the Fiesta Bowl events.  It was New Year's Day and very early in the morning.  The employees all have high energies greeting everyone from the drive-thru window.  All the prices you see from the menu will be what you are paying for, all prices included taxes already so you won't have to worry about what the final prices will be.  I thought the wait will be long since there were few cars right in front of me, but no, once I pulled up to the window and got my drink, it was less than 90 seconds and I was out of there.  One thing I don't like is if you pay for your drinks by credit card, they don't give you the receipt, you'll have to ask for it yourself.  Not sure about if they'll give you a receipt or not if you pay by cash.  Overall services definitely deserved all 5 stars.

Great place to get a coffee or tea.  Great place to have conversation too.  All their menu prices includes taxes already, so you know exactly what you are paying for.  Whatever drink you want, they'll try their best to make it for you.  Their service are great and the attitude is outstanding.  Stop by the next time you need a cold one, or a hot one.

I'm not an AT&T customer and I will never be, but I was there with a friend because she wants to buy the screen protector for her new Samsung Galaxy S4.  When we walked into the store, there were a lot of customers waiting to be served and there were only 3 employees covering the store, 2 females and 1 male.  We were greeted by the male employee that he will help us once he's done helping his customer.  We waited for about 5 minutes and noticed that the male employee has disappeared and is no where to be found. We waited and waited and then none of the other 2 female employees ever came and let us know that we will be helped.  Be in mind that they were helping their own customers at the time, but still, I was shocked that they don't care about other customers but the ones they are helping out at the moment.  No wonder people said AT&T has the worst customer services, I never knew that was true until last night. Good thing I'm not an AT&T customer, or I would go crazy for not being offer any assistant.  If you want a good service, try going to another AT&T store or just shop online.

Been going to Delia's Cleaners ever since moving to the Kierland community over 10 years ago.  Great services and very friendly staffs.  Most of the wait are under 3 minutes.  They also have a drive-thru window so you can get in and out in a very quick fashion.  If you do dry cleanings often, make sure you join their Value Club membership for only a one-time charge of $4.95.  But if you are just doing dry cleaning every once in a while, you can just print their coupons off online.  I remembered that they used to have a 50% off coupons, then 40%, and now the coupons are just 30% for general dry cleaning.  They really have good prices and services.  All orders will be ready after 5pm next-day except Sundays where they close at 4pm.  Give it a try if you are looking for a good quality dry cleaners.  They have many locations through out Metro Phoenix area.

I recently went there again because I want to use their birthday certificate, $10 value off for everything on your bill including alcohol.  You must spend at least $10 before you can apply that $10 credit to your bill.  Make sure you join their E-Crew mailing list.  I ordered Burger Slider because I want to find out how good their fries are, and I must say, the fries was very delicious.  It's very crispy and in big chunks.  Ketchup was the only sauce available to go with this dish; Next dish was the Fish Tacos.  It used to be $5 for two, now it's $6 for two, I think it's a big jump, but it was very tasty and good.  I don't mind paying for more, but I like the size to be a little bit bigger, I finished my taco in less than 3 bites each; Last dish was the fried calamari.  I lope the two special sauces, one of them was the Thai Chili sauce.  The texture of the calamari was improved, but the serving size is still not enough.  I washed everything down by ordering a Blue Moon draft, the glass was iced cold and the beer was refreshing.  My server was Kelly and her attitude was great and service was excellent.  It wasn't very busy as Happy Hour was just started before I got there.  If you want freshness and great service, you have to go to Bluewater Grill.  And make sure you sign-up for the mailing list for your $10 coupon on my birthday month.

Great place to get your tires rotate and balance if you purchase tires either at this location or another Discount Tire location.  Scheduled an appointment the night before to get a tire rotations, balances, and tire pressures check at 2pm.  Finished my meeting early and called them to see if I can move my appointment up, John answered the phone, believe he is one of the managers.  Told me sure, bring my car over, stop by, provided my info and his techs went to work on my vehicle.  In and out of the shop within 30 minutes.  Great place to work with and they will beat any local competitors pricing.  Especially Costco and Sam's Club.  I would not go anywhere else!

I have never and will not be T-Mobile customer.  I was just in the store to see if I can find a hard case for my Samsung Galaxy S2 phone from Sprint.  The reason that I don't like T-Mobile is because their phones are all very expensive and I can get a cheaper phone from Sprint across the street.

I went there on a Thursday evening around 5:30pm.  It wasn't all that packed and I was seated by the kitchen in the back against the wall looking out.  It was a sunny evening.  When I first heard of the name, I thought, wow, people who dropout of the culinary school must all go there.  I was totally kidding with that remark.  My date and I ordered Chips & Dip, it was homemade chips, not too salty and not too oily, which was great because I didn't want my fingers to be all greasy and sticky; We also had Korean Chicken & Shrimp on sticks, it doesn't have the flavor of being a Korean food and it tasted blend; Their HH food and drink items are just $3, it's totally worth the buck.  And the beer came in a small cute glass, it will definitely fill you up.  Our server was Benjamin, he's service was excellent.  If you aren't sure what to order, make sure you ask him as he'll tell you what's good and what's not so good.  Try it out the next time you are in Old Town Scottsdale.

Just look at the name of this place, QuikTrip, if you are on the road and need a quick stop to get either something to drink, free air for your tires, or cheap gas, this is the place to be.  I need premium gas for my car, so this place usually and always have cheaper gas, probably somewhere between 10 to 20 cents cheaper from all other major gas stations.  So I would definitely recommend this place if you are on the run.

Great location, easy in and out of the parking lot.  You either enter from Tatum Blvd. on the Southbound lane or enter from Shea Blvd. on the Westbound lane.  Great area right by PV Mall.  Coffee is great, might even be better than Starbucks.  Never tried the pastries there before so don't really know how they taste.  Will definitely go back again.

Fast service inside the branch.  For now, there's only 1 drive-thru lane where you can do payments.  The other lane is either out of service and/or being fix.  I waited for about 10 minutes recently at the drive-thru lane.  They need to make sure they have enough lanes for their daily businesses as there's only one B of A branch in the area.

Best private bank in the state of Arizona.  I used to work across the street from the bank, and I was recently in the area and decided to check this branch out as I believe that this was the 1st MidFirst Bank in Arizona.  I enjoyed their fast and friendly staffs.  In and out of the bank in less than 5 minutes.  They also offer nationwide free ATM service, it's a must if you travel a lot like me.  And they are the home bank for Arizona State University Sun Devils!

Been coming here a lot to fill my prescriptions.  They accept coupons too, so that's a huge plus for me.  This store isn't a 24/7 store, which is a bummer, but at least they have friendly people working there.  Make sure you apply for their in-store discount card to save some money for all your visits.

How can you not give this bank a 5-star?  It opens on Sunday, most banks don't.  It extend their business hours Mondays thru Fridays, most banks don't.  It gives you unlimited uses of other banks' ATM and reimburse you with the fees, again, most banks don't give you that options at all, unless you have a lot of money in their bank and they maybe will give you 1 to 2 times free monthly.  Seriously, do try them first before you give a bad review.

This branch is right in the middle of Penske Automotive Group in Northeast Phoenix / North Scottsdale neighborhood.  I recently had to rent a car through them because my dealership ran out of loaner cars.  For some reason, the day I wanted to rent a car, they are short of it so I either have to pick Nissan Sentra or Dodge Grand Caravan.  Being a tall guy, there's no way that I'll be able to fit in a Sentra so I took the van instead.  All services were great, they show you on your rental agreement on what you are paying and how much you will be charged once the vehicle is return to them.  They have this special deal where you pay $10/day for fuel charges so you won't have to worry about refueling the car when you return it the next day.  Good customer service, friendly and polite employees, fast speed checking in and out.

I usually don't give fast food restaurants over 3 stars, but this place deserve an extra star because they filled up my strawberry milkshake all the way to the top, not 80% full like other place does with the excuse of "oh, we did this by the weight".  You filled it up because people paid money for it.  If you are giving it out for free, then maybe you can use that stupid excuse.  Props for their fast service too.

This luxury apartment is located at 23rd Avenue & I-17 in Northwest Phoenix near Phoenix Deer Valley Airport.  This place offers free breakfast Mondays through Fridays between 7am - 9am.  Really never seen anything like this place before.  This place is huge, more like a luxury hotel.  This apartment complex housed a lot of pilots in-training from the nearby Deer Valley Airport.  Not sure how much rents are monthly, but I'm pretty sure it's not cheap with everything that's being offered for all the residents.

Great place to go to since this is the only place in Downtown Phoenix that's actually lit up and actually have lots of shops to go shop at.  Many different restaurants to try out and a bowling place (Lucky Strike) for you to hang out and have drinks with your friends.  Parking is a major issue is this area, you either park with valet, under the garage where it cost a lot of money per hour, or you park at the meters which are free after 5pm daily and on the weekends.  Or if you prefer to save some more money, you can just take the light-rail and then don't have to worry about drinking and driving.  Definitely a good place to check out if you haven't been to downtown area in a while.

Ordered a pizza recently due to not wanting to cook at home after a long day at work.  Stopped by the store, not busy at all, placed an order, told that it'll be ready in about 15-20 minutes, left to meet few friends that were having dinner at the near-by restaurant.  Stopped by back after about 25 minutes and the pizzas were waiting for me.  Don't even need to tell them what pizzas I ordered, they knew right away.  Friendly staff, won't push you for ordering a larger size.  Good location near Scottsdale Airport.  I shall be back again here.

Great place to go to especially on the weekends, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  Line can be long, but if you know people, you can pretty much just get in before other people.

Great place if you need some snacks and/or drinks late at night since this place is open 24 hours a day.  If you don't have the Extra Care card, it's their in-store discount card, make sure you get one.  You don't have to carry the card with you all the time, put your phone number as an alternative account number and just provide your number when checking-out.  They also will take manufecture coupons, so get those in there to increase your savings.  Sign-up with your e-mails as well as they will periodically sent you e-mails with discounts and promotional items.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are staying at a hotel near-by and don't want to pay for the high price gift shop products.

Terry & Thor are the greatest.  They will do their best to help you get things done.  I have been renting from this location on and off for the last 5 months and their service are just excellent.  Check with them the next time you need a van, storage unit, or just moving supplies.  You won't be disappointed.

What a rip-off!  They charged us for a beverage when we didn't even want it.  And seriously, $5.99 for a beverage?  I know it's a buffet, but that's like highway robbery.  I think I will go somewhere nice next time.

This branch has a newer version of the ATM system that won't ask you if you are depositing cash or checks separately.  You just select the account you want to deposit the money in and you can combine both cash and checks.  Very good idea.

Bring a pair of ear plugs or two.  I was deaf for like 10 minutes after coming out of this place.  Still don't know what all the hypes are about this place seeing there are always a line waiting to get it every Fridays and Saturdays.  The interior space is very small and you can't really dance with anyone in your group.  I'll be staying away from this place for a while before returning there again.

When I used to work near Dobson & Main in Mesa, I come here at least once a week for lunch.  I love their spicy chicken sandwich and the waffle fries.  I always upgrade to the biggest waffle fries size they have, because they are just THAT GOOD.  Everyone who works there are very polite.  Everytime you said thanks or thank you to them, they will always say "My Pleasure", it's like that's their saying, "thanks for eating here and it's my pleasure to serve you".  That's just great.  You don't hear many people say that anymore.  Stop by and try it if you have never had their food before.  You won't be disappointed.

Went there once and will not ever go back again since they don't have a lot of food selections.  One good thing about the buffet is that you get to choose your own ice creams by scooping it yourself, but other than that, I think I'll pass.

Don't know what's so good about this place anymore.  The food used to be great when they first started, but after years of changing ownerships, the food services started to drop.  Used to be good waiting in line to get into the place, now it's not a fun idea to wait in line anymore when they aren't even busy at all.  All their bouncers are just bad at their job, it's suppose to be a hospitality place inviting people into their place, now they are just turning people away.  You have to tip them a lot to get in, this is NOT Vegas, this is Scottsdale.  Stop thinking that people in Arizona will spend a lot of money going to a dump place like this.  Time to find a new place to go on the weekend.  This place should just go rot in hell.

Great location right off Loop-101 and Chandler Blvd.  The only con about this location is that it took forever to fill up as the speed of the pump is very slow.  But other than that, great price.  You pay different prices for the lowest grade if you pay with cash instead of credit/debit.

Don't really eat Greek food as it's not very popular locally.  But I would always try any food at least once.  And I really glad that I came to Mika's one night.  This place was tucked in the very back at a shopping plaza between Scottsdale & Tempe.  It was hard to find at first, but lucky I found this gem in time before they closed for the night.  I ordered Mediterranean Chicken Pita with Fries and my friend ordered Original Tyro Pita, also with Fries.  And since this is Greek food, Falafel appetizer is a must, so we ordered that as well.  The flavoring was very tasty, but I'm still not a fan of this type of food.  But at least I gave it a try, hopefully I"ll have better review next time.

Great place to go to for happy hour and cheap food/drinks.  Parking might be an issue if you go at their peak times.  You might have to park your car at the nearby Safeway lots and walk over.  Great service and delicious food/drinks, can't go wrong with it.

Cheapest lunch buffet.  $11.99/person on weekdays and maybe more on the weekends.  All you can eat everything.  Beverages extra, even soft drinks.  Sometimes there are coupons online for 20% off the whole bill, and I believe seniors can get 10% off their bills.  Good service, and great price you can get anywhere else.  Come try it out!

Great place to be at especially during spring training baseball games with Salt River  Field just across the street and have free shuttles to/from the restaurant so you don't have to worry about drinking and driving and can actually enjoy the games.  Happy Hour food and booze are great prices too and they are absolute delicious.  Sit at the patio and enjoy Arizona sunsets!

Went there last night for the first time since the Grand Opening in February while meeting an old college friend (Arizona State, Go Devils!).  Outside looks great.  Plenty of parking spaces with bright lighting all around, easy access from SR-51 and Paradise Valley Mall.  Spaces inside is huge, small fountain fireplace on the outside patio on the west side of the property.  Lots of TV's in and around the bar area, plenty of seating places.  The only down side is that there's only one pool table, which was on the corner area of the bar, not impressed with that since the lighting was low.  Didn't order any food, the beer selections were great.  Always ask the waitress on what's good since they have beer of the month choices.  Beer came out fast from the tap and the glasses were always cold, making the beer taste much much better.  Will definitely come back again to enjoy the great view.

Great place to have a birthday party and/or a picnic at the park which also have a basketball court and a volleyball field.  Has a nearby dog park too so you can bring your pets out and let them run loose.  The community center inside offers different activities that's open for everyone.  Plenty of parking as well.  Great location!

This is the newest CVS store that I've been to as I don't  usually come to this neighborhood to shop.  The store is in the then- Bashas' grocery store.  The store is very bright and have good selections.  I was just trying my luck for a special soap I usually get at Target, I was so shocked to see it and the price is cheaper too.  Definitely coming back here again for that specific soap.

What a great idea, park near the airport without paying the high fee and get a free shuttle to/from the airport.  Make sure you print out coupons online as the online price isn't the same as the drive-in price.  And make sure you actually bought a parking space for this location and not the other one much closer to the airport from the light-rail.

This location is pretty big for Scottsdale.  They have fresh veggies and fruits.  The floor spaces are very wide, so if you have a electric scooter, it will definitely fit.  The floors and the restrooms are very clean as well.  Once a year they will offer $100 worth of gift card for only $79.99, so definitely a good buy if you shop here a lot.  I especially love their bulk coffee beans where you can choose to buy just 1 flavor or mix bunch together.  This location is the only one in South Scottsdale that's just south of Camelback Rd. between Scottsdale Rd. & Miller Rd.

How can you not give this bank a 5-star?  It opens on Sunday, most banks don't.  It extend their business hours Mondays thru Fridays, most banks don't.  It gives you unlimited uses of other banks' ATM and reimburse you with the fees, again, most banks don't give you that options at all, unless you have a lot of money in their bank and they maybe will give you 1 to 2 times free monthly.  Really enjoy banking with this bank, check them out.

Shopped here few times before when it was Sunflower Market.  Didn't know Sprouts took it over until I was at the nearby Sweet Tomatoes having dinner.  The store was huge and very bright and it has everything I was looking for.  I especially love their organic produce section where they have the freshest veggies and fruits in-stock.  Will definitely go back again next time I'm in the area.

Not really a big fan of the wings since it doesn't have a lot of meat on it.  But I do like to try out different sauces from the very spicy hot atomic to the sweet teriyaki.  Whatever you like, they have it.  The had the special boneless wings for 60 cents a piece, but no specials for the bone-in wings, not really sure why not.  I especially love their fries, so fresh and not too salty.  This location is right by ASU Tempe Campus and it's near few major freeways, Loop-202, Loop-101, SR-60, and I-10.  Traffic will be a little bit tight during afternoon rush hours.  Overall a great fast service, you should definitely check it out if you are a wing person and have never try it out before.  I would say that it's much much better than Hooter's and Buffalo Wild Wings.

Everytime I came here, they always have 50% off everything.  Are they always having sales and not show any signs at all?  I'm sad that the wallet I purchased 2 years ago are no longer in production.  Looks like I'll need to find something else to crave my collection.

Went there yesterday evening for an early dinner with some co-workers, we ordered Taiwanese Sausage, Oyster Omelet, and Stinky Tofu with Garlic Kimchi for starter.  All these dishes are traditional Taiwanese dishes.  We didn't order any soup because it was very hot outside and the soup is not going to help us cool it down.  We also tried the Signature Crispy-Fried Tofu under the Chef's Specialies menu as well as the dim sum type dish, like the Beef Bing, a Chinese type of flat bread.  And also the Pan-Fried Jumbo Dumplings with Chinese Chives and dried tofu stuffed inside Chinese flat bread.  We ended the dinner with a cup of plum juice to wash down all the fat and oil we consumed.  I would suggest you ask the waitress to see what's good and what's not if you have never had Chinese food before.  Good luck!

Very disappointed after hearing about SNS opening the only store in Arizona.  Ordered the original cheese burger with regular fries, for other type of fries, you would have to pay extra for it.  The only good thing coming out of this place is probably the Coke machine where you can mix different drinks together.  Other than that, you probably get better burgers at nearby fastfood joints.

Love everything here.  It's a brand new store opened not long ago.  Sitting on the busy intersections off SR-51.  After every purchase, if you go to do a survey within 2 days from your purchase, you can get a free donut with purchase the next time you stop by the store.  They also partnered up with Arizona Cardinals, for every win, you get a free iced or hot medium coffee, no purchase necessary but you do need to have the app installed on your phone and/or tablet.

Fresh fruits and veggies in the produce department, the bakery baked the best pastries.  Clean store and friendly employees, the only down side of the store is that the cell service inside the store sucks, you literally have to finish with your call before you even step into the store, they need to fix that problem if they can.

Right now they offer free wi-fi service, so make phone calls inside the store is getting a little bit better, but it still depends on where you are in the store.  Some area still have zero reception.  Still a very clean store to visit and all their employees are very friendly and you can press their "door bell" call button if you can't find anything in the store.  That's a big plus since sometimes it's very hard finding what you want in the store and can't find anyone working in the store.

Finally having a Fry's Fuel Center close to where I live, now I didn't have to drive all the way to 40th Street & Thunderbird Road.  Their prices are very reasonable comparing to Circle K gas stations.  Finally I can shop at a Fry's convenience store after midnight when the retail Fry's store closes.  Definitely going to stop by here more often now!
