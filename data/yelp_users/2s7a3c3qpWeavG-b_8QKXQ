I would give this place 10 stars if I could. My dad was craving ceviche, so I decided to take them to Mariscos Playa Hermosa. There is a reason the reviews for this restaurant is so high - it has great food, great service, and beautiful furniture/ decorations.   Before we received our order, we were given chips + salsa/guac. The chips were very oily and I wasn't a big fan, but that initial impression was soon overcome with the best tasting ceviche on top of a crispy corn tortilla. My mom, who isn't a fan of cilantro, said that it was the highlight of her meal.   My dad and I decided to share the House Special/ Molcajete ($30 for two people), which consisted of shrimps, two tilapila pieces, two chicken slices, and two beef slices in green sauce. It came with corn tortillas, rice, beans, and salad. None of my family members can eat spicy foods, but there is also an option for the "Diablo" sauce, which I heard is pretty spicy. We were definitely not let down - it was just the right taste and the right temperature. My mom got the garlic shrimp (I think it was $13?) and the portion for the main piece was relatively small-medium in size, but it also came with rice, beans, and salad. She liked the clean taste.  The service was great; our waitress constantly checked in to see if we needed anything. The noise level was loud because there were constantly people coming in and out of the restaurant, but that signifies just how many people are fans of this restaurant. Also, for anyone who's curious, there are TVs (might be good for game-days).  At the end of our meal, we got a free coconut cake by checking in to Yelp, and the cream on the cake was delicious; the icing tasted like a sweeter version of coconut ice cream. When we were finished, we were way too stuffed. Dad said that we should come back again with the aunts - that's one of the rare times I've ever heard him say, "let's come back again".   Highly recommended! If you like seafood + Mexican food, go here.

Out of the restaurants that I have been to, the decoration of this restaurant was splendid. Rustler's Rooste was complete with an indoor slide, indoor wall-fountain, performers, amazing city views, a photo-booth, silly cutouts that you can put your face through, and an overall western vibe. Coming into this place, I had great expectations for the food. Sadly, the food wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I ordered the steak, which came with beans and corn. It was alright, but tasted like any other meal. The steak was a bit too chewy, the corn was... well, corn, and the beans were just 'okay'. Something was amiss. Also, it was difficult to have a conversation because it was quite loud. I'm not sure if this was because of the location of the table.  The restaurant didn't have a sit-and-dine kind of atmosphere, but rather a louder, rowdy wild wild west kind of atmosphere (which could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending).   Bottom line: -I would recommend checking out this restaurant if you want a new experience and a fun atmosphere, especially if you're new to Phoenix or Arizona. Also, this place would be good for parents with kids to visit. -I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're searching for restaurants with exquisite or scrumptious foods.

I went to the Kona Grill in Chandler Mall during happy hour, and for $3.50 I got a 8-roll Philly sushi that tasted decent. More than the food, though, the atmosphere and decoration of the restaurant was definitely top-notch. I sat outside in the patio, but the server was amazingly attentive, checking in once every while to see if we needed anything and filling our water. My friend and I was satisfied with the service and the vibe of the restaurant. Would recommend to other people, and would go again.

Happy hour at Four Peaks Brewing Co? Great idea! Four peaks has an awesome interior with tanks of beer. Since it's a generally big area, it can accommodate large groups, both inside and outside.   Now, to the important part. Drinks and foods. I haven't tried the beer due to personal reasons but the cider was good - they have a full bar for those with food allergies/ sensitivities, so if you can't drink beer, don't be discouraged! Try their other drinks which are equally good.   The enchiladas and the massive five layer nacho plate was good considering it was bar food. I highly recommend the nacho plate appetizer when with a large group - for about $9.50 you get so much food. Check out the happy hour that takes place from 2-6 and from 11pm onwards. I haven't tried their actual dinner menu with the burgers and salads, but I want to go back to try.  One of the aspects that stood out to me the most was the great service. Four Peaks had better service than the other breweries or bars that I have been to. All of the waiters were awesome - they checked in often, filled our glasses, and made sure that we were cared for.   No wonder the place was packed on a Thursday evening - they have amazing servers and amazing drinks.  Bottom line: unique house-brewed beers, kind staffs, and quick service make this place one of my personal favorite bars.

I had a late night dinner at Macayo's. It was a very big place, and I went to sit at the "bar" area in the back with a friend of mine.   We ordered two margaritas (mmm) and chicken chile burros. The service was good, the burros were good, and the margaritas definitely were good. Chips and salsa came with the order. Our waiter was kind as well.  The reason why I gave this place four stars instead of five was because the atmosphere was fairly loud, and I couldn't have much of a conversation with my friend. To be fair, it was a Friday night, and there were many people there. I would recommend coming here with a large group, because Macayo's can definitely accommodate many customers in their large areas.

When my family went to eat dinner on a Friday night, there were lots of people in the restaurant. It was a medium-large sized restaurant, and there was some wait time. We didn't mind, because there are couches inside near the cashier and some seating areas outside.  One of the first things I noticed about the restaurant were the modern Thai decorations. They had large photos hanging from the walls, as well as some Buddha decorations that went nicely with the overall atmosphere of the restaurant.   Overall, there was friendly service, although the waitress could have been more attentive; she was nice but didn't check once until the end. To be fair, the restaurant was very busy and there was a water jug that we could fill our own waters with.  The noise level was a bit loud, but there were lots of people in the restaurant. I think we were seated near the kitchen, because there were busy waiters coming out; we constantly heard the clanking of dishes. It might have been quieter on other days and in other areas of the restaurant.   I got the Massaman curry, which was good. It had a nice strong coconut flavor, and came with a choice of tofu or chicken and potatoes. My mom got the drunken noodles, which were good in small amounts but perhaps not so much in large quantities; the sauce was overbearing (quite salty). My sister got the pad thai, which I thought was the best out of the three dishes. I would recommend the pad thai.   Overall, very satisfied. I feel like my experience would have been more amplified if the restaurant wasn't so busy, but I probably will come back again. I'm a fan!

I've been here a few times for lunch, and I have not been disappointed once! I went to the restaurant on a Friday afternoon with a few coworkers, and there were lines forming outside the door. The prices are really unbeatable, and portions are generous. The red tamale plate that I had was quite spicy, but I was able to balance it with the restaurant-made chips. For those who are checking out the restaurant for the first time, there is a self-serve area with corn/flour tortilla chips and salsa. Highly recommended!

Located near Asiana and Hodori, the Street makes a nice addition to the line of Korean markets.   I absolutely love Diamond Ice - it tastes like the authentic bingsu from South Korea. After lunch, I went to the Street with my sister and my parents, and ordered the medium diamond ice. The portions were huge; between the four of us, we had to "push" ourselves to finish it. It came with mochi, fresh fruits, ice, red beans, and condensed milk. It's a pay-and-eat kind of a place, so there aren't many staffs but the lady taking our order was nice and the wait time wasn't long. The shop also has ramen, boba, and smoothies, and the prices are good.   The decorations within the shop is interesting - I think that you can leave writings on the walls as long as you let the owner know. There are lots of graffitis and drawings, giving the shop a "hip" feel - really cute!   Will be back for more diamond ice and boba in the foreseeable future. Highly recommended.

I love Vietnamese food, so I just had to try this place.   I was pleased with this restaurant. They had great food and offered lots of variety in the menu, including rice dishes, pho, buns, and more. I never tried quail but it was surprisingly good (it tastes like a saltier/chewier/bonier version of chicken if you're curious). The sauce on top of the quail topped off the appetizer - I would recommend it. We had another appetizer - the tofu spring rolls. It tasted very healthy and clean, and I liked the peanut sauce that came with it.   I ordered the chicken "bun" noodles, which had rice noodles, lettuce, chicken smothered in sauce and a side of fish sauce. My friend got the vegetarian pho, which she enjoyed.   The server checked in pretty often and were very polite and helpful with our order. While we were unfamiliar with some of the menu items (like the quail), she provided us a detailed explanation of what the appetizer would entail. I'm glad that she did, because it convinced us to get the order. Yum yum!  I went to dinner on a Thursday evening and there were quite a large amount of people in there - Pho Da Lat has good business which shows that customers regularly go to this restaurant.

I'm not sure why this place doesn't have the best reviews, because I had a marvelous experience in the restaurant. The interior was fantastic, the waiter checked on us very often, and the food was great. I didn't have the sushi because I wasn't feeing it, but had the rice bowl that I enjoyed very much. Sure, the prices were higher compared to some restaurants, but it is located in Tempe Marketplace and quality sushi is served. Also, for $7, my friend got a huge glass of wine. Those concerned with the prices should check out the happy hour menu- they have a variety of great foods! I'll have to go back to try the sushi.

I never had Indian food this unique. The first thing that I noticed was the good smell of Indian curry and the overall atmosphere featuring many Indian decorations. Everything from the bronze plates, spoons, heavy metal water cups, baskets, added onto the experience. My friend who is from an Indian family actually said that the restaurant served good authentic food, so I'll take her word for it.  My friends and I went as a large group, and was attended and helped frequently. The lunch came with a complementary appetizer with different sauces and something that resembled crackers (refer to picture), and we ordered an additional garlic naan. When we were about to order, there were an overwhelming amounts of different kinds of curry - I appreciated the choices, but it was somewhat hard to decide because I wanted to try it all. People can request for different spice levels - I wouldn't recommend going too high though because the food can be very spicy. I'm awful at eating spicy foods so I ordered the no-spice-at-all curry, which was still great. I had the chicken curry, and my friend had the one with cheese chunks inside. I know that sounds weird, but I think I actually liked her curry better than mine.   Along with our curry, we got large platters of rice with hints of different spices. I wish I could explain it better, but the taste was something that I haven't personally experienced before. Take my word for it though - the food at this place was good.   I will go back to The Dhaba again for sure because I found out that I really do love authentic Indian food, and I'd give more than 5 stars if I could. With amazing setups, great food, kind service, I'll be sure to bring my sister over for a meal!

I would have loved to give Blanco 5 stars for the quality and taste of food, but there were some complications regarding the service that we received.   My friend stressed to the waiter that she has a bad dairy allergy. Originally, her entree would have consisted of three tacos, a plate of beans, and rice, but she asked for 1) tacos without dairy products; 2) black beans; and 3) no rice (because of butter) but extra beans.   There were several things wrong with how her food arrived. 1) Her tacos came with cream fresco that was hidden under the meat. She ate one, not knowing that it was hidden, and felt absolutely nauseous and was unable to eat anything else. 2) She asked for no rice, but her entree came with it anyway. 3) She ordered black beans but received another kind of beans (possibly pinto?). 4) She did not receive the extra beans she asked for. It was careless how they handled my friend's food, especially given her allergy. She was nice enough to refrain from pointing out the mistake regarding the buttered rice and the beans.  When we told the waiter about the cream fresco on the taco, he seemed unapologetic, and barely checked up on us throughout our meal. The waiter's response to the various mistakes associated with my friend's order was that he would make two more tacos for her, this time without sour cream. The two small tacos took such a long time to make that I finished my entire meal before she received hers. She asked for a to-go instead.   Update on the to-go order that was put in: Blanco put cheese and cream fresco on the tacos they sent her home with.   Honestly, it might have been just a bad day at Blanco, and I might consider checking it out again for the food, because the food itself was delicious. However, the service was so off-putting that we got out of the restaurant in a hurry, and it was even more disappointing that they would put dairy products in her to-go box.   Bottom line: A restaurant that does not care for the health concerns of their customers is not a restaurant that can be trusted.

I would like to start out by saying that the service here is exceptional. The waiters are kind every time I go, and the atmosphere is great as well- it's decorated very nicely. The food is also good- I felt like the curry was cooked well, and the dessert (sticky rice with coconut) was delicious. One of the better Thai places in Phoenix.

The museum encompasses many instruments inside a beautifully constructed building. Admission tickets cost $20 per person for adults, which is an amazing deal to be able to see all of the instruments. The staff members are friendly and informative, and I'm sure they would be glad to help anyone with questions.  My sister and I spent four hours to see the entire museum. Most of the instruments are in the upper floor, with areas divided by cultural regions (North American, European, South American, Asian, Middle Eastern, African, etc.). Within each cultural region, there are instruments traditional to the region. Downstairs, the museum has an area dedicated to electronic instruments, and another section for famous artists, including John Lennon, Pablo Casals, Joshua Bell, and Elton John. Also, there is a section where you can play some of the instruments that are featured inside the museum, but that section is usually pretty loud because people (including the kids) are trying the instruments, all at once. For pianists, the museum has a Steinway in the hallway, and the museum encourages any pianist to play.   All of the displays have informative videos and descriptions. Each museum-goer is given a headset, which automatically plays the corresponding information. For the entire time in the museum, expect music to be playing within the headsets. Personally, I was glad to be able to hear the instruments rather than just viewing them.   Overall a great experience - I would love to go back a second time to see if the museum has any new additions! Great place to go with dates, friends, family, and/or children. Highly recommended.

I love the concept of Pomegranate Cafe.   It's a vegetarian restaurant that promotes healthy and clean eating. They have lots of gluten free options or gluten free substitutes, so it might be a good place to go to for people who have allergy concerns. They serve lots of organic and local produce, and have cute hip decorations. The water that they served had cucumbers in it and came in little mason jars, so yeah, trendy. It was quite busy even on a Friday afternoon, which shows that many people enjoy coming to Pomegranate Cafe.   I had the breakfast burrito some time ago, and I liked it a lot. This time, I ordered the protein bowl, which was great. I loved the scoop of pesto-macadamia-avocado topping on top of the eggs. To be honest, I feel like I might have been able to make the protein bowl on my own with lots and lots of great veggies and eggs, but I appreciated that the cafe served dishes where people could could decipher what was in their food. My mom got the Athena wrap, which she liked, and my sister got the Kung Pao Burrito; she was sweating by the time she ate half of her burrito because it was spicy.   The only downside about this restaurant was the price; it was a lot pricier than I expected it to be. To be fair, there were lots of organic produce that went into creating the dishes, so I can tell why the prices were higher. I would go more often if the prices weren't so high; overall, I would give this place 4.5 stars if possible but rounded up because of the amount of thought that must have gone to making healthy foods tasty.   Bottom line: Trendy and hip vegetarian restaurant that promotes clean eating... with flavor. Highly recommended.

Fresh & Easy is clean and quiet, and within walking distance from my apartment. The store makes fresh and healthy foods easy to shop for, but the prices are higher. I compared some of the prices with foods that I regularly buy at Sprouts, and they were about $0.50 to $0.75 more expensive per item. Plus, the store didn't have as many sales as Sprouts. I'll probably continue going to Sprouts rather than Fresh & Easy, especially because Sprouts is only a few minutes away from this location, and also offers health foods.  On another note, I liked how Fresh & Easy had a huge section for juices and other healthy drinks. They neatly stock their produce and their food items - the organization of the items and the convenience of the location was a plus.

I went to Republic Ramen + Noodles because my friends were hungry. Since I already ate dinner before meeting up, I decided to simply order an edamame and a boba.   I would have given this place two stars for the food. I do not recommend ordering the edamame or the boba here. I usually love sweets, and will leave good reviews for bobas, but I was surprised that I could be turned off so much by the taste of boba here... the boba itself was undercooked and hard, and the almond milk tea tasted saccharine-awful. The edamame was filled with salt - I spent a lot of time wiping off the salt with a napkin. So, why the two stars for the food? I tried some soup of my friend's Tokyo Ramen and the broth was alright. She said that the ramen was salty but okay. If you end up going here, do yourself a favor and just order the ramen.   The reason why I gave this place one star, rather than two, was because of the lackluster service. We waited a very long time for our food (how long does it take to make boba and an edamame?), and when my friend asked where her food was, the server wasn't very helpful. We went in a group of three; one of my friends and I got our orders first (we waited about 30-40 minutes for the food; the edamame and the bobas came out at the same time as the Tokyo Ramen), and my other friend had to wait about an additional 15-20 minutes before her ramen arrived. Also, off-topic but the bathroom seemed unclean.    Although the Tokyo Ramen was okay, there are tons of other restaurants with better food and better service. I will not return, and I do not recommend this place.

Despite the bad reviews, I thought that Francis & Sons wasn't too bad. I brought in my car, which was very dirty and dusty because it hadn't been cleaned in months (I know, gross, sorry), but the car was cleaned relatively thoroughly.  One of the best aspects about Francis & Sons is that they have a good place to wait for the carwash to finish, with some couches, tables, car accessories, and food & ice cream. It was a little bit loud because they have a TV (I think they were on the Dr. Oz channel last time), but I did homework anyway and it was fine. They have Internet for the customers, but it's painstakingly slow.   The employees didn't seem happy at all, but I guess no one can really be happy cleaning cars outside in the Arizona heat. On the contrary, the person at the register was nice - I had a Groupon for the Ultimate Car Wash, and she took care of it well. The Groupon resulted in about $15 per car wash for the Ultimate wash.   According to Groupon, here's the breakdown of what the Ultimate Car Wash entails: -Full-service car wash -Interior vacuum -Complete window cleaning -Towel dry -Sealer spray wax and clear-coat protectant -Air freshener -Tire shine -Triple-foam polish spray -Cream conditioner for dash, front doors, and console -Trim dressing for all exterior plastic  The Works Car Wash doesn't include the last three on the list. I got a 7-day guarantee on the car wash, so that I would be able to bring in the car again if it rained.  The interior of the car was very clean - the carpet was well vacuumed and the dock was glistening with its newly waxed surface, but the exterior could have been cleaner. There were some spots that was amiss, but given the condition that I brought the car in (yuck), I can't complain. Also, I got the vanilla air freshener, but it smelled weird.   Overall, I would recommend Francis & Sons if you have a Groupon/coupon.

This bakery is a wonderful little place to satisfy a sweet tooth on any given day. They have all kinds of different cupcakes, treats, and non-alcoholic beverages. I bought the gluten free coconut macaroons, which was just the right texture and sweetness.   All of their bakeries are vegan, and people looking for gluten free options can find cupcakes on Tuesdays. You can also call ahead for larger or special orders- the ladies are very understanding and helpful.   There is a parking lot next to the bakery, but I personally found it a bit difficult to get to it because the bakery is located in downtown and it was hard to navigate with the traffic (to be fair, I'll also a bit direction illiterate, so you might not have trouble at all with parking).   I would recommend this place for anyone that is seeking a good place for desserts, for satisfying their crave, buying a batch for coworkers early in the morning, or preparing for large parties such as birthdays. Will be back for more!

The most outstanding part about Mellow Mushroom was the great service. A group of friends and I went here for happy hour, and was unfamiliar with some of the drinks - Mello Mushroom carries a huge list of beers. The waiter made some awesome recommendations, and let us sample drinks. He seemed to really enjoy working at the restaurant, which made all of us happy. I had the grasshopper cider - it had a very unique taste to it, and was pretty strong. I liked it a lot.   By the way, if you go during happy hour, it's half off of the drinks.  The restaurant was clean and had a relaxed atmosphere. Great staff, great drinks, and great atmosphere - highly recommended.

My family and I decided to go to Spinato's for the first time on a Saturday, and the restaurant, although fairly large, was packed. No surprise there, because the food was good, but there was a wait time. Nevertheless, our server took good care of us when we were seated.   I got the combo on gluten free crust, which was really delicious. The crust was similar to the GF crust sold at Sauce: chewy and slightly crunchy at the same time. It's been a while since I've had good pizza. While I never got to try the "Mamma Spinato's "Signature" Fresh Spinach" pizza that the rest of my family members got, they expressed that the pizza was cooked to perfection - even my mom, who doesn't like cheese, ate a few slices. My mom got the pear & pecan salad, which she expressed was good with a slightly "sour" taste to it (the good kind of "sour").   The only downside of Spinato's was the wait time for the food - we didn't really mind waiting to be seated but we were very hungry by the time the food came around. It took about 40 minutes for two pizzas and a salad, and it was a challenge to entertain my sister's two hungry and tired toddlers during that time. Although they were given kids' menus with crayons, they showed little interest... because they were hungry. My mom commented that it may have been better to order ahead for a pickup and eat at home, especially in consideration of the children. If you're hungry, I recommend getting an appetizer to munch on while you wait.   Bottom line: great pizza, yummy salad, lots of GF options. Good service. Wait time is long, though, especially on weekends.

After some Thai food, my sister and I were craving the sweets. We decided to try Churn. When we arrived, there was a line forming outside of the shop. We were determined enough to satisfy our sugar crave that we decided to wait underneath the Phoenix sun... and were glad that we did.   The moment I stepped in, I saw lots of candy that I wouldn't have thought existed. There were also some bakery items like cookies, brownies, and lemon bars. More importantly, there were lots of ice cream options. I sampled the whisky almond ice cream, and fell in love with its thick, whisky, creamy flavor. The shop itself has cute retro-style decorations. Since Churn is a relatively small shop, customers cannot eat inside, but there is a patio area dedicated for eating. The patio is adorable as well!   Even if you aren't a fan of ice cream, try Churn. They have many options other than ice cream; it would also be a good place to pick gifts for people who absolutely love desserts and are up for trying something different. Yum!

For those with allergies or food sensitivities, Nami is a great place to go to! I had the tsoynami with a friend as a treat, and it was so good. I had the Coffee Coco Loco tsoynami, which came with chocolate, coffee, and little pieces of crispy rice. My friend had the Almond Oy Vey, which came with coconut flakes, chocolate syrup, and almond silvers. Keep in mind that both of these "ice cream" were gluten free and dairy free, and it was amazing how good it tasted! The tsoynamis were a bit lighter and icier than their traditional heavier icecream counterparts, but I liked it better the tsoynami way.   Nami also has quiche, pastries, shakes, yogurt parfaits, gluten free donuts, as well as vegan donuts and brunch on select days.   Will be definitely going back to try their gluten free donuts and their parfaits before work, and definitely will be back for some tsoynami treats - I'll post pictures! In a happy food coma right now... Highly recommended.

I never thought that 'vegetarian' could taste so good!! Everything on the menu is dairy free according to the cashier, and there is a separate menu for gluten free foods.   I got the coconut curry with fake chicken meat - I could have been fooled it was the real thing. My friend got the coconut curry with tofu, which had so much flavor. The curry bowl came with brown rice hidden under a pile of healthy and crunchy steamed veggies, all smothered in a flavorful yet slightly spicy sauce. The only factor was that the curry didn't have much of a coconut flavor, but it was still really delicious.   I have absolutely no concerns about the ingredients that are used- as far as I know, Green is very transparent about their foods. Definitely the place to go to for people wanting healthier choices other than salad. I would recommend trying this place, even if you're not vegetarian. You would be surprised!

Since the temperatures are getting warmer, I gave Mister Softee a try.   I personally thought that the ice cream was delicious - the ice cream truck features soft-serve ice cream with vanilla, swirl, or chocolate flavors. The soft-serve can be dipped with various topping choices, including chocolate-dipped, cherry-dipped, or sprinkled, to name a few. I got the chocolate-dipped ice cream, which was good.   Bottom line: Fast service, cool ice cream truck, unique choices - I'm a fan! Just wish they had peanut toppings, though, because I go "nuts" for them.

Luncha Libre definitely has interesting and unique versions of quesadillas. The cashier was very friendly and helpful regarding my allergy issues, notifying me that I could order gluten free options by substituting the flour quesadillas with corn tacos.  Now, let's talk about the food. I got the chicken quesadillas in taco form. The order came with three tacos on soft corn tortillas with lots of filling ingredients and chips+salsa. My friend got the Thai quesadilla, which he thought to be very spicy - I would recommend it only for people who are fans of spicy foods. The passion drink that I got was a bit too sweet for me, but my friend ordered the half lemonade and half unsweetened tea for a make-shift Arnold Palmer. Now that was good. All of the drinks come in a mason jar that people get to keep, and will get a $1 discount off of the next drink if they bring the jar back. Way to be green!  On the slight downside, $8+ for the cheapest quesadilla was a bit on the pricer side. However, considering that it was a food truck, which usually tends to run on the higher side for food, the investment was well worth it - I consider Luncha Libre to be one of the best food trucks that I have been to. I loved the clean, non-greasy taste that the tacos had - you know that something is made right when it tastes flavorful yet not overwhelming or greasy.  I might go back to try the blue cheese quesadilla (in taco form). Overall, very satisfied.

I'll give an honest review for this place - although How Do You Roll isn't a bad place to eat at, I've gone to much better places that serve better-tasting sushi at the same or less price than this restaurant. For this, I gave two stars - I got the bowl with brown rice, tuna, tofu skin, and avocado - it came to be about $10.80 after tax. Although the description sounds like the selection would be good, it really wasn't anything special, and the portions were small for $10. Compared to the other sushi places that I have gone to, How Do You Roll tasted like any other fast-food restaurant that didn't really care about the quality of their food, but rather quantity and pricing of some rolls. I would recommend resorting to some of their rolls (they have some rolls for $3 during happy hour). I don't recommend getting the bowl. Overall, I was disappointed and although I wouldn't avoid the place, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this restaurant.

I originally avoided Sprouts because it gave off too much of the "healthy store" vibe, and thought there wouldn't be many choices. Little did I realize, Sprouts stocks so many diverse food choices, including some cultural foods or gluten free foods that may be harder to find in other stores. Usually, I can find most food items that I'm looking for. There is also a large organic section that features seasonal veggies.   Sprouts offers many good deals and sales; as a health food store, the health food items are not much more expensive when compared with other stores like Safeway or Fry's. It's very conveniently located, so I often go to Sprouts for groceries.    I don't know about the other locations, but the cashiers and staffs are always, without fail, kind and helpful at this Sprouts. I haven't come across a grocery store yet that has such nice customer service.  Why not enjoy a little while being healthy? Check out Sprouts.

One thing that I noticed when I went inside the building was that it was way too cold. I get cold easily, but many of my friends confirmed that they were cold as well, and couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant into the heat. Now, that's a bad sign from the beginning. It's pretty warm here in Arizona - I don't understand why the restaurant needs to blast the air conditioner so much.   While we were freezing away, the waitress gave us awful service, and barely checked in. I don't think I saw her smile once, and she had a very off-putting manner about her. She wasn't helpful at all with the order, and to top it off, she took forever to bring me a separate menu containing allergen information. She started taking the order right after I received my allergen menu, making me rush through; I didn't want to hold off my friends from ordering any longer. On top of that, the food seemed to take forever to come out. To be fair, we were in a large group, but the wait time was just too much.   The waitress forgot to bring out my friend's appetizer and another friend's ranch, and she brought out the wrong order for me. I got the $7 lunch dish that consisted of two chicken wraps with fruits on the side, but she gave me the $10 dish consisting of three chicken wraps, no fruits. I didn't bother mentioning it to her because I was afraid of the additional wait time that it would take to add the fruits, but was quite unhappy about the extra charge that was reflected on my bill, compared to the original lunch order. Since the waitress rarely checked in, had a demeaning attitude, and left as soon as she was "done" filling up the waters leaving no time for me to ask her anything, I had to personally walk up to the front to another waitress and ask her for a to-go box.   Now, let's talk about the food. I liked the fries - they were pretty good. However, the chicken wrap wasn't worth it - I could make better chicken wraps with a piece of lettuce, some canned vegetables, microwaveable chicken, and ranch. Wasn't about the food at all.   The one positive about this restaurant is that there are lots of TV's, so it might be a good place to go to if there are sports events (if there are no other places open). I don't think I'll voluntarily come back here again, unless there's a meeting or an event.

As much as I thought the food was rather mediocre, I thought the service was amazing. The servers were nice and were checking in with me frequently. They had an extensive bakery menu, and everything was vegan and homemade. I had the gluten free pancakes, which were okay, and the potatoes on the side almost tasted a bit burnt. However, the service was so great that I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3.

Loved the bar for its country concept. The drinks are served in mason jars; they have a large beer collection. I had the cider, but it was mediocre. The prices are higher, as expected of bars, but there are $1 drinks during happy hour.   The best part of this bar was the mechanical bull. Really fun.   Overall, I liked the bar for the atmosphere. If you're into country, you need to go here.

This place might just be one of my favorites to get dessert.  A few of my friends were having cravings for something sweet on a Friday night, so we decided to try Tea, Snow & Coffee for something new. There were tons of people inside, so we figured that there must be a reason for this place to be so popular, and there was.   Note, this is the first time I ever tried shaved snow, and I fell in love. I don't know how they make the shaved snow, but it had a texture that was thicker than regular ice cream; it was almost sticky, but in a good way. Two toppings can be chosen with the order - I ordered the taro shaved snow with a strawberry topping. The cashier gave me double the amount of strawberries - I was really happy about that. To top it off, the prices are very reasonable.  The location around this shop has lots of Asian-related markets, including Pho, an Asian market, an Asian bakery, and lots more. I highly suggest trying this place!

The restaurant is very nicely decorated and has a wonderful atmosphere. I went here for a business meeting, and the service was friendly and prompt, the drinks tasted great, and the food contained lots of varieties. Since we were a bigger group, we were in the patio. There was also a live singer, which was a pleasant addition to the experience. I would definitely come back here with my friends or family for a special occasion, and would recommend this place for businesses and big parties.

WhereUBean is very conveniently located near restaurants, including Spinato's. It has a cute and cozy atmosphere, and has a good local vibe. It is a relatively quiet coffee shop; they have a few tables and couches inside with lots of seating availability, so it's a good place to grab a coffee and study for the finals. They have good wifi connectivity.   I received nice service from the barista, and the prices are similar to Starbucks (see picture for menu). The Americano tasted like it was well-brewed. I wish they will have more customers in the future - I couldn't ask for more in a coffee shop.

Marshalls has tons of great deals, but at less expensive rates compared to Nordstrom Rack. There are lots of great items to choose from, including brands like Freepeople, Calvin Klein, Guess, Express, Michael Kors, Coach, and more. I bought most of my business clothes and handbags from Marshalls. Depending on the season, there are other items, including some bathing suits during the spring/summer and jackets during the fall/winter.  Other than casual, business, and athletic clothes, Marshalls carries other items, such as some kids toys, exercise equipment, notebooks and frames, decorative elements for the house, and utensils for the kitchen. There are also some tables and furnitures for outside areas.  I highly recommend Marshalls. Take my word- they have really great items if you look right!

I can't step foot in this store, because I'll be tempted to buy everything. There are way too many cute ideas for me to handle.   Michaels is a large store filled with craft materials that force you to be creative. Some items are amazing deals for their price, and others are a bit amiss - I bought a knitting book for my sister at Amazon at a reduced price compared to Michael's, but I think that some other items (especially for crafts and sale items) are great deals. Some of the products are not available because they are sold out, but the staffs are relatively quick to restock. The customer service is always great - employees seem to be happy and relaxed!  If they had better deals for some of their products, I would go much more frequently. That being said, if you have any need for artistic/craft inspiration, I recommend checking out Michaels.

I really hate leaving bad reviews, but this time is an exception. When I went in for lunch, the place was practically empty. It took a very long time for the server to come back with our food, and it wasn't the best tasting Jamaican food that I have had. The rice tasted mediocre, like it was cooked before and left out for a long time before being served. I thought that I was the only one who thought that the place wasn't great, but the rest of my friends shared similar thoughts. I probably won't go again.

For Easter brunch, my friends and I decided to go to Snooze, but were disappointed to hear that there would be a 40 minute wait, especially when we were hungry. We decided to go to Postino Annex next door, and were seated right away. The entire staff members were very kind, helpful, and welcoming.   It was our first time at Postino, so our waiter was especially helpful by recommending the Vegetarian panini with chicken for my friend. She got the salad-panini combo, and I got the Farm Scramble. Although I haven't tried the vegetarian panini w/ chicken, my friend told me that it's very good. I tried some of her salad, and it was also tasty - I loved the walnuts, goat cheese, and dried fruits on top of the spinach and dressing. As for the farm scramble, it was also good - the eggs were scrambled with Yukon Gold potatoes and cheese, and came with a side salad and tomatoes. The salad and the tomatoes had some mystery dressing on it - I wish I knew their secret recipe so that I could have it more often.   I was really thirsty, so I was worried when the waiter came by with small glasses of water. However, I was very happy with the service because they kept refilling the glass. Our waiter checked in often (maybe even too often?), to see how we were doing. I'm giving the service a definite 5 - the staff made us feel like we were cared for.   I'll be back for some wine or mimosas. Recommended.

I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could. This was my first time at Dozo, but according to my friend, the restaurant was under new management for about 6 months now. She told me that the chef was from Thailand, which probably explains the variety of food items that the restaurant offered. This wasn't a typical Japanese restaurant - they had lots of other menus as well.   Dozo had lots of great interesting appetizers - I tried foods that I wouldn't normally have been able to try in typical sushi restaurants. For example, I saw some beef tongues in the appetizer, but I wasn't daring enough to try. Instead, I had the bacon with okra - I never had okra before but it tasted like a chewier and juicier version of cucumber, for a lack of better description. I highly recommend it - I ended up liking it a lot. I also had the Vietnamese sausage which tasted like a less-saltier version of sausage with teriyaki sauce and a different aftertaste. Lastly, I had the squid dish (sorry I'm blanking on the name) - it was shaped into little balls. I posted a picture for reference, just in case you want to try it - that appetizer was great, too.   I ordered the poki tuna don, which was basically white rice with lots of marinated tuna slices. I loved the sesame flavor. My 10 year old friend like the beef bowl, and told me that the kids' size was perfect for her. The Bento box (chicken katsu) came with lots of food as well, including rice, chicken katsu, salad pieces, and other side dishes.   I will come back again for sure, possibly with family. It has unique concepts, and a really pretty outdoors seating area too.

On a night on Mill, my friends and I decided to check out this bar because we have never been to a piano bar before. We didn't really know what to expect, but was very happy that we came. There is a $5 cover, but it's free for students (with student ID's)!   When we entered the bar, it was low-lit, blue, and modern. There were two people playing the piano and singing, and a server attended us as soon as we sat down. We were able to request songs by filling out a simple request form and placing it on a piano on the stage with a tip. The pianists/singers were playing music constantly, and knew many songs, a lot of them classics, including songs by Beatles and Michael Jackson. They also played some modern songs, including those by alternative and rock artists. What I liked the most about the Low Key Dueling Piano Bar was that the customers were singing, dancing, and interacting with the stage. The noise level was loud, but it's a piano bar, after all.  The drinks were reasonably priced, and the servers were very attentive and polite throughout. I would highly recommend checking out this place - it's definitely different from the other bars that I have been to, and I love it. It's super fun - I had a great time!   On another note, the stairs leading down to the entrance look like piano keys. It's a great spot for a picture :)
