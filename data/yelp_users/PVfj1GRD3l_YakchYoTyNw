OK, when I've had a little too much fun ... wink, wink. I know the only thing that will prevent me from having a hangover is the same thing that will cure a hangover: Cheap, greasy food.  And nobody does it better that Chico's. Come on, five tacos for $5?  The food is great, the service is friendly and fast and the price is right.  Let's grab a six pack, six shots of Cuervo and then head to Chico's so we will be ready to do it again tomorrow. What do you say?

This place is simply adorable. ADORABLE! Exactly what you want an old-fashioned ice cream parlour to be! A little pricey for me, but  oh-so-delicious! Yummy!! Take a group and buy The Mountain. Trust me. And right now, they're offering $50 gift cards for $25. A bargain!!

If you're looking for one of the best holes in the wall, check out Pepe's Taco Villa. It's been in business forever and there's a good reason: the food is consistently top notch.  The chicken mole is worth doing a spin class for. It's easilt the best mole in town. No competition.  If you're looking for something different, try the Mexican pizza. Again, the best I've had in Phoenix.  It's not the fanciest place, but it's one of the best.

I loved everything about my experience at Phoenix Rock Gym.  I had never been climbing before and was a nervous wreck, but the staff put me at ease, made me feel safe and comfortable and I had an exhilarating experience.  Great workout. Perfect way to clear your mind and learn to focus. And they have different areas to accomodate every level of climber.  I will be back.

I was looking for a neighborhood joint that wasn't a chain and I found one with Lux.    It's a neighborhood coffee in the truest sense. You've got all your regular characters - dude who looks like Jesus, hippie chick in her cool hippie skirt, aspiring artists (one overweight hipster even wearing a beret), couples pulling up on bicycles, old guys reading the paper. Truly local people with a sense of silent comaraderie - you just KNOW not to be yapping on your cell in there.  You can feel comfortable and feel like you can disappear for a few hours.  Good, solid espresso drinks, free WiFi.  If you live in the area, you should definitely be a patron and support this local spot (as opposed to Starbucks down the street on Lola up the street).    I dig it.

My absolute favorite place in the world for date night. Share a bottle of wine and a pizza and don't forget a Nutella crepe for dessert. Love love love this place.

One of my favorite places downtown.  Cool vibe. Cool goods. Great vegan donuts. A nice coffee.  I'll Conspire with you any time.

I don't get the negative reviews of this place.  I went there with a date after we saw a movie at the Arizona Center. The food was great (the sauteed spinach was the best I've ever had and the steak gave Durants a run for its money at half the price). My date said his food was equally great and planned to go back,  The service was perfect.   The only thing that left me puzzled why why it was so empty on a weekend night. Kind of made me wonder.

If I could only eat one type of food for the rest of my life, it would be pizza. And if I could only go to one pizza place in Phoenix, it would have to be Mamma Mia's.  Everything about their pizza is perfect. Sauce. Cheese. Size. Crust. Price. All perfect.  And I'm not a huge wing person because I don't like fried food, but I am pretty sure Mamma Mia's wings are baked and they are delicious.  And the customer service is amazing. Last time I was in there, they threw in a free 2-liter bottle of soda for free.  Pizzeria Bianco, you ain't got shit on my Mamma Mia's.

This joins my long list of places that I really want to love, but ...  I love the atmosphere. I love what they SAY they stand for. I love the concept of two hippies dropping out and dropping back in as restaurateurs.  What I don't love is the food. The chicken and fish tacos I had were bland. No flavoriing. Thank god they had hot sauce (not homemade, store bought) on the table to spice things up a bit.  On a positive note, the prives were good and the salsa they serve with store-bought chips wasn't bad. And the lemonade (they were out of most flavors both times I visited) was good.   But overall, maybe it's time for the hippies to clean up their act. Worry about the food a little more than the message.

I am worried that they are already opening a second location, especially since it's so close to the original.  Love the carne asada tacos. Hate the parking situation. Love the mom-an-pop atmosphere.  And I love the fact that I can ride my bike there, not have to worry about parking, have a couple cold beers on a Friday night and relax.

I love that I can walk to this place from my apartment.  I also love the yummy (but very pricey) drinks. And I love the ambience.  In my four visits, the sushi has been exceptional (twice), good (once), and bad (once).  I would highly recommend any of their spicy rolls, particularly the Spicy Hana. And if you're looking to save a buck, their reverse happy hour is killer.  Work on the consistency and I'll give you 5 stars.

I posted a review of Lola after my first visit and was asked to take it down because some people thought it was too harsh.  I've given it four chances now.  And I have to say, I am disappointed with Lola. I have been on the hunt for a chill coffeehouse in my neighborhood, where you can work and sip coffee, and occasionally chat with your neighbors. I live in right on Roosevelt Street and was hoping Lola would be that ... but it really lacks the ambiance I am looking for. The coffee was alright. The espresso shots tasted like they were burnt. The croissant I had was dried out.   But the vibe is what was really lacking for me. I left after 45 minutes. I would rather be in my own house ... in my own space. I think the owner was in when I came in once and he didn't even make eye contact or greet customers ... nothing. I think that's why Lola is lacking an authentic vibe.  It is an intimate space, and the decor is nice, but being in there puts me in a bad mood. Too many wannabe hipsters and pretenders - and that includes the inappropriately dressed and overly tattooed baristas behind the counter. OK, you've got fake boobs, we see them already. I don't need to see them so intimately. You may also want to get a pair of jeans that fit so I don't have to see five inches of butt crack while you're getting my coffee. And dudes, having ink doesn't make you hip. Being able to be engaging and interesting makes you hip. And the sour looks don't help.  I REALLY want to like Lola, but every experience I've had at Lola has been full of the attitude that I hope to avoid in an independent coffee shop.   Very disappointing.

I had a difficult time giving this place even a single star, but had to give them credit for at least having the TVs on so we had something to do while we waited FOREVER for our food to arrive. Our server certainly didn't distract us from the wait. Her appearances were about as frequent as snow in the summer in Scottsdale. I'm not going to even get into how bad the food was - the "homemade" pastas were obviously prepackaged and frozen, the sauces bland and sometimes difficult to swallow. In retrospect, we should have tried the pizza, but I don't hold out much hope that the quality would have been much better. Here's some advice for Chef John: Maybe it's time to spend more time paying attention to the quality of the food and service in your restaurant and less time doing every local TV spot you can schedule. I visited Cibo e Vino TWICE before writing this review. Both visits were on weekends and the chef wasn't there either time. We were told both times that he was away for the weekend with his girlfriend. After learning that Chef John actually got free money to redesign his restaurant made me even more sad and angry at his total disregard for the quality of the food he serves, his customers and the nearby residents who would benefit from a good Italian restaurant. Shame on you. I would say that you owe me at least two free dinners, but I know it would be inedible anyway.
