Tried this place today to answer my pasta crave. I was impressed with their spicy spaghetti Vesuvius. Now, I'm a big fan of spicy foods of different ethnic cuisines, so I didn't find it close to being spicy but I loved the dish. The sauce was sweet and garlicky but not overbearingly sweet. Entrées came with choice of salad or soup, bread and butter, and desert. Service was great! Our waitress was attentive and friendly. They have a full bar so I tried their mojito which was made just right. Full 3 course meal and a mojito all under $15. I highly recommend it to others and I kinda want to go back soon... Like, tomorrow!!

Trying very hard to be unbiased since this is my Saturday night spot for a year and a half now. The bar: I enjoy the employees attitude, the new country with some top 40, cupid shuffle, some throwback songs, and fairly priced drinks in this decent sized dive bar. For smokers, there's a large back patio area. An ATM is available in the darts room. Parking is in front, the back, or at Food City. The Cash has supported charities, held drag shows, and threw themed nights, like the most recent black out party, and  they also host poker games, dance lessons, and of course, karaoke. For busy nights, they have 3 bar tenders serving, 2 in the front and 1 in the rear.   The crowd: If you're visiting or new/ transplant, compared to flashy Los Angeles, hipster Seattle, and melting pot NYC's lez scene (to name a few cities), I've noticed that this place has lots of butch lesbians, about an even number of femmes, tomboys, androgynous, and a small handful of ultra femmes. For the most part everyone's friendly. You'll see a wide age range here, along with some straights, gay boys, etc. I've also noticed a trend.... the Cash's bathrooms are never nasty and are always stocked with TP and paper towels lol.   Come by, grab a drink, get your 2 step on, or twerk and grind, or just wiggle around... at The Cash, the Cheer's of Phoenix's lesbian population, and have a great time :)

I came here for lunch take out. Decided on calamari and sausage pasta. The service was very good and server was very welcoming and attentive. I was worried having it to go might take away some of the quality of the food but it sure didn't! I really liked my sausage pasta ($9.95) and calamari ($6.95) and the lunch came with soup or salad and I opted for lentil soup which was delicious! The lunch was packed with marinara sauce, parm cheese, and bread. I would highly recommend for others to come eat here, I sure plan on coming back! (Military discount offered!)

I've never stayed to eat here but always satisfied with my beef or chicken chimichanga. Others who have been here complained about the utensils/ plates being plastic/ paper, but I've been to Mexican restaurants where plates and utensils were all pretty but food wasn't all that. I recommend to others to try it out.

Came here with with some pals on a Friday night around 6:30pm. There were about 5 tables left and those sitting and eating looked like they were enjoying their meal very much. The wait to order did not take long and there were pictures you can refer to on the wall. While waiting for our food, the server was very attentive and accommodating. Finally, after a few short minutes wait for our meals, my sweet and sour chicken (requested extra spicy) and dumplings arrive. Boy did this place had delicious food and inexpensive!! Most Chinese food restaurants give you the fatty chicken chunks but this place didn't. The dishes were full of flavor!  I would love to come back here and try their pho!! I highly recommend to others!

Came here on cinco de mayo and it was a packed house! Even though it was, the wait for food was not bad at all and you always had chips and salsa and margaritas filled while you wait. With cheap prices you consider quality over quantity but with this restaurant, it wins both!!! As much as I want to keep this place a secret... I highly recommend for others to try it out. The secrets out!!

Located in the Venetian Hotel, this nightclub is pretty cool to check out. Music is dance, some hip/ RnB, but def upbeat songs so you never have to stop dancing! Drinks are ridiculous though, but then again, finding good drinks for a decent price in Vegas isn't that easy. Still, if you're looking for a good time, I recommend checking this place out.

Great costumer service. Decent food. I grabbed jade red chicken, jerk chicken, jerk fried rice combo. It was yummy. I'd say the Phoenix Chino Bandido tastes better but it's always a crowd there. The jerk chicken had the perfect spice to it. Not overwhelmingly hot. I'd tell friends to give it a try if in mood for Mexican/ Asian fusion.

Loved their taylor ham and egg sandwich! One thing about this place is the food isn't greasy or made you feel disgusting after wards as the serving was just right.

Very small place, but very cozy... When it's busy, it's tough to find a place to plant myself. One time on a First Friday night they opened up the backyard and was serving brews there and lots of open space. There's occasionally bands playing there...love the fact that they serve Delirium. Very glad to have found the lost leaf.

Friendly service! I always grab a sushi, which is mediocre. They're beef bulgogi is awesome! It doesn't taste like the bulgogi I've had in S. Korea (which I assume is pretty legit) but if it had a different name it still would be awesome!

I've tried a few Korean restaurants in Phoenix to answer that bulgogi crave. It's hard to find a match to what I've used to eat when I lived in Songtan, S. Korea, but this place comes close. I mean to try other dishes but can't steer away from their beef bulgogi with sam (lettuce for wrap). This one isn't the type that grill in front of you, but the taste and friendly service make up for it. I highly suggest for others to try. Well worth your money.

Came here 6pm, almost every table taken up, no seats at bar. Ordered dolmathes and calamari which were reeeeally good!! I've been to their Goodyear location for their gyro which compared to others found in west valley is A++... Service was really good too, always checked on. Will come back and highly recommend!

I love this place. It's not just oriental foods, but majority of foods are. Has everything from Indian, to Filipino, to African to European, to Jamaican...ok you get it....close to EVERYTHING that I otherwise would have to look online for. They have a little restaurant just before the main store, not sure if contracted out or theirs, I forgot what I grabbed, either a frappe or a fruit slush, either way I would remember if I it was gross. It wasn't. For those looking for international taste, I highly reccomend this place!!

Been coming here on Fridays and Saturdays to start the night and the service is great, atmosphere is chill, and drink prices are very fair. I highly recommend. There's a neat patio for the smokers with bar access, plenty of tv's to watch the best music videos, 2 pool tables inside and just an all around cool bar.

I had the bento D which was sashimi, chef's choice of 5 generous slices, salad, spicy tuna rolls, bbq beef, gyoza, and miso soup. It was delicious!! I also had the calamari appetizers but that was a ok. Being the third time being there I would highly suggest for others to try. My table's service was good as well but I've noticed our waiter started to forget certain requests such as water refills when the restaurant became a little packed for lunch. Other than that I've enjoyed my meals here!!!

Service could have been better. Sushi was def non stop and a good variety and you can request something. The only thing is the sushi here is the dryest I've ever had. I've been to other sushi conveyor belt type places and this is okay compared to those. I wouldn't drive out of the way for this though.

Been here 3 times in 1 month. Love their pho. The food serving/ price is real good considering their "small" bowls of soup are huge! Food is always fresh and doesn't take long to prepare but have been there with maybe 3 other tables of people around. One night a friend & I didn't realize that they were closing soon but one of the employees stayed late. I had the Beef ball pho and the spicy beef vermicelli from here and this mango tea slush dessert (don't remember the name) and love it. I recommend to others!

Tried this place out for lunch and had the panang chicken curry with rice. I asked for a 3/5 spicy and it was on point!! Most places I asked for really spicy or 5 and it's a hint of hot. Tasted great, service was good, and I def would recommend to others to try!!

Ordered the special slice which I'd have to say was a lot bigger than I have expected! I love thin pizzas and theirs was just that! They were generous on my slice with toppings. I had mine to go so it was as fresh out the oven but I def would come back again and recommend to others. It's not inexpensive but wasn't over priced... this is a case of "you get what you pay for" and I enjoyed their friendly service and the pizza as well.

Just passing by one morning and wanted breakfast. Saw Dunkin Donut's and this in one building. Chain vs. local business. Had to go with this place and glad I did. I had a breakfast burro (sausage, egg, and cheese that came with a small tub of salsa) which was $4.50. I must say, it was really good!! The burro was made with love lol. I recommend for others to try out their breakfast items!

Neat!! This place has the most random set up as you will find in other reviews. Menu is all organic, our bar tender/ server was very entertaining. The location was a bit hole in the wall, but once inside very worth it!

I ALWAYS got to come here whenever in town. Love their freindly service and the loco moco. I've tried their other dishes but can't seem to get away from deciding on loco moco :P Fair price for the serving you get of food you don't find everywhere. Highly reccomend!

The only Indian restaurant I've been to in the PHX southwest area. The service is always great and the dishes I've ordered are always delicious! I've never been here with more than 5 tables seated so I am always served fast. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoy Indian food or willing to try!

YUM! If you like sushi, then I recommend this place! Def not for those who are afraid to eat raw fish. If you're not sure of what things are, they will gladly describe and give you a little sample to help you decide.

The size of the rolls are tiny! The service is at least good and the bright side, the dragon roll and tuna roll I ordered were at least very fresh and delicious compared to some places that make giant rolls and are tasteless. I'm really trying to think quality over quantity, but I'm also paying for it.

Being here the 3rd time in less than 30 days, I'd like to say I've tried a different dish every time. But that's a lie. I've always grabbed fried fish balls for appetizer. And have tried Chicken Tom Yum, chicken Pa-nang curry, and my fave is the Thai pumpkin curry. I've been trying to fight the crave for that pumkin curry!! I ask for level 3 spice, but it's a good hint of spice.  The prices are reasonable and the ambience is laid back and quiet.  The servers are professional and do a great job getting back to you. I've never been here at peak meal hours, so I don't know if that would change on that. I highly recommend this place as its so far my fave in the southwest valley of PHX. Military discount available :)

The service was ok, the food tasted ok, the timeliness was ok. Overall just ok. My Smash Burger, drink (free refills), and sweet potato fries totaled to $12. It was worth a try but I don't think I'd come back.... On the bright side, it definitely is a better burger than what you can get from fast food chains!!!

Went here for a few cold brews on a Sunday night. Barely anyone there that night but it's a new establishment. They had cornhole which was enjoyable to play with the pals. Large LCD tv's all around the walls. Clean place , relax environment, friendly staff. Will check it out again another time.

Today was the first time trying their pho. I ordered for take out spicy vermicelli pho that came with beef and pork. I believe it was number 53 or close to it on the menu. I've been going to a different pho place in the area and I must say I really liked the service and the broth they've used for their pho. I highly recommend to others who also enjoy pho. The best in south west valley so far!

Great service! Showed up around 6-7pm on a Wednesday and was seated right away. Ordered a cucumber cocktail and chicken spicy red curry. The dish had plenty of veggies and chicken . No complaints at all! The spice was between 1-2 Thai hot (I love spicy food, may be too hot for others) my cocktail however wasn't terrible but wasn't on point. I still would highly recommend for others to try out this place!!! Environment was relax, dim, with a wall dedicated to inaudible anime playing.

Had a gyro lunch special for $7 (plus some change) and I substituted the fries for a house salad and soda w/ lemonade. I called in prior picking up the food to speed up the process and it was ready within my 10 minute drive to there. I was the only costumer on a weekday at 1130 for lunch, which I'm surprised about since eating the gyro, it tasted pretty good. I'd like to come back and try out their other food on the menu! I recommend for others to try!

First time trying out this place after a coworker gave the recommendation during lunch. Had my order of gyro wrap with salad to go. Upon my arrival, I was greeted with friendly service and the place had a casual vibe and was kept clean. The food???... Deeeeelicious!! Plus they had military discount! Found my new fave west valley Greek restaurant alongside Dino's!

It's close to work, regular teriyaki chicken bowls for $5.79?! I'm sold. It's also not a long wait for food. For military, you receive 10% discount (not sure if mandatory uniform or sufficient with just ID). They always include an extra small container of teriyaki sauce with all orders (meats already cooked with teriyaki sauce. I've tried their sushi and its so-so. Def a place I would recommend for those who crave teriyaki and/or udon (noodles)
