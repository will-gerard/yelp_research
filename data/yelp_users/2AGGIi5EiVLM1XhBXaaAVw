I'll admit to occasional skepticism of DDD featured restaurants, but I've dined here pre and post DDD, so its not a factor in this review. In fact, I'd much rather drop into the Wild Thaiger (love the name) than its more illustrious and aging neighbor Durant's.   We sampled a couple of soups and peanut chicken on our latest visit and, as usual, loved all the selections. We arrived for dinner a bit early on a weeknight and had no wait. Service was prompt and courteous. Menu pricing is reasonable for the quality and location. The kitchen is open concept (sorry, I'm mixing up DDD with Home Hunters) and visible to the curious if you like seeing your food prepared. And the décor is part tiger, part Thai.   There are a lot of excellent Thai spots in the Valley, making it a very competitive category in which to earn a five star review. Wild Thaiger is very close. It's also just a bit different from the norm. We always do soup at the Thaiger, not our norm. If you have a passion for Thai cuisine, definitely give Wild Thaiger a try. I wish it was located a bit closer to where I live so that I could more easily frequent it and ponder an upgrade to five stars.

It's been a while Honey Bear's. I apologize. I've been a little obsessed with Little Miss BBQ as of late. I remember when you were the Little Miss BBQ in town. Trekking down to Van Buren was the same adventure that being surrounded by barbed wire at Little Miss is today. This was my first ever visit to your Central Avenue location. The BBQ was as good as I remember. We ordered your pulled pork and your chicken. Both were great. We also enjoyed having our pups with us on your front patio. Thank you.  So what's the deal with all the mediocre Yelp reviews? Is it Yelp herd behavior, not wanting to give a great review unless others feel the same? Has there been an actual deterioration in quality and service? Are people really not getting the idea that BBQ sauces vary regionally? Is it a problem that Honey Bear's Mac and Cheese was developed before White Truffle Mac and Cheese became a foodie staple? Can't tell you. Our experience was great. Perhaps the herd instinct even had an impact on me, however, as I settled on a four star rating after considering five.  Yes, there is only one BBQ sauce. Yes, the décor is basic. Yes, the counter staff is not overly loquacious. Yes, the outdoor seating is right next to Central Avenue.  I'm just not sure how much any of this matters if you're looking for a BBQ joint. My taste buds still steer me toward Little Miss, but Honey Bear's is a very solid alternative. And one without an hour long wait! I'll be back!

A colorful little store. We enjoyed just walking the aisles.   A great selection of piñatas. Well made. Some Disney themed. Some sport themed. Some beer themed. In other words, you'll no doubt find a piñata here that will meet your needs. Most priced at $20, including a stick and a bag of candy.  A great selection of Mexican candy. Listed as a candy store by Yelp, Dulceria Pico Rico is really a party store, but it is a party store in which you can buy mass quantities of a variety of Mexican treats.  A great selection of party supplies. Lots of typical Disney merchandise, but also plenty of plaster centerpieces and the like that you won't find at Party City. I'm pretty sure they're not all officially licensed products, but what the heck? They're fun.  The building is a bit worn, typical of the neighborhood. The exterior murals, however, are awesome. The only problem we experienced this day? No helium in stock for balloons. No worries. The problem was easily solved by a quick trip to a nearby dollar store.   Absolutely a five star piñata store. Some other areas of the store are a bit cluttered and perhaps deserving of fewer stars, but I'll award five stars based solely on the piñatas and the bulk Mexican candy. We'll definitely be back next time we need a piñata.  .

MacAlpine's, established in 1929, is a Phoenix treasure. It was still an operating pharmacy and soda fountain as recently as 1991, at which time the pharmacy side of the business surrendered to new era competition. Fortunately, the soda fountain remains.   I'm awarding five stars, partly out of annoyance with snarky one and two star reviewers unaware of the spot's historical significance, but mainly out of love for MacAlpine's ice cream concoctions. Moreover, how can you not award five stars to the establishment where Wayne Newton was discovered in 1962? Note to the one and two star reviewers: Wayne Newton is an American singer and entertainer who is best known for his 1963 hit song Danke Schoen and more recently as a surgically enhanced Las Vegas headliner.  I must confess that I'm not a huge fan of the food at MacAlpine's. How often do you read that in a five star review? Let me clarify. The menu is fine, but why would you want to risk eating a Sloppy Joe and not leaving room for a sundae? Another note for prospective one and two star reviewers: The ice cream at MacAlpine's is not hand crafted. It's basic ice cream, served in a manner consistent with the tradition of a soda fountain. Just as it should be. If you want Sweet Republic or Churn like flavors, go to those establishments and please don't write a negative review for MacAlpine's.   MacAlpine's is amazingly kid friendly. Also friendly for anyone else who still has a little bit of kid within. There are roughly 100 flavors of soda from which to choose. One hundred!!! Want a sundae instead? How about Bears at the Beach, a Carousel or Dirt & Worms? They also have a variety of sundaes that cater more to adult tastes (if you must). Or instruct the waitress construct the customized treat of your dreams. The location on Seventh Street is an ideal stopping place before or after a downtown trip to the Science Center, a Dbacks game... Note to one and two star reviewers: Sure, there is a lot of dusty and worn old stuff on the premises. Just remember, you too will one day be old and worn if you're lucky enough to make it over 80 years (and it wouldn't be polite to point it out to you). I suggest you travel back in time and embrace MacAlpine's quirky nature. Be sure to budget a little extra time to enjoy the antique/vintage/retro store located on the premises as well.

Our family has always loved 5 & Diner. Unfortunately, the PV Mall location closed recently, replaced by a Starbucks! Aargh! Fortunately, the 16th Street location, the original 5 & Diner, is still serving up a solid assortment of comfort food. The 1950's theme of the restaurant, reproduced though it is, seems genuine enough. Fun. Friendly servers. You can see why it's a favorite photo op for politicians and the like.   5 & Diner is open 24 hours a day, functioning equally well as a late night hangout, a morning coffee spot for retirees or as a place to take children for ice cream and pancakes. Coin operated jukeboxes located in many booths actually work! Selecting songs and waiting for them to play is great entertainment for kids. They also provide kids with paper hats and crayons. Or, if you're eating outdoors on the patio, hula hoops! The patio is also dog friendly.    Shake and sundae offerings are classic and delicious. They are best enjoyed sitting inside at the counter in my opinion. Breakfast offerings are served 24 hours a day. You're not going to see menu items at 5 & Diner being written up in food magazines for creativity and innovation, but they are American comfort food consistently well prepared.     5 & Diner is really all about the ambiance, 1950's style. Bring the kids, or bring the dog, or bring the kids and the dog, or bring your friends in need of a late night sobering up, and enjoy yourself.

Visited on a Thursday night. No wait! This CPK's bread and butter is the business lunch crowd, making it a great alternative at other times.  A very friendly and engaging server (Allie, I think) made for a very pleasurable evening. Any CPK visit is usually a three star, review unworthy, event for me. The positive five star service this night, however, prompted this review. (3 + 5)/2 = 4 stars.  Warm bread with olive oil. Solid salads. Solid pizza. Great kid's meals. Have you ever seen the kid's brownie ($1.29) or the kid's sundae ($0.99)? I posted a photo of each just in case you have not. Adult presentation at a kiddie price. You may just have to convince junior to share it with you.

Far and away my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. Start with the friendly, family oriented service. Members of our family have been eating here for thirty years. We are always greeted like old friends, even if we haven't been by in months. My only complaint? The staff seems to look younger than ever, while I get older and older. Oh well.   The food is wonderful. Our family favorite is the Bo Bo Platter, a delicious participatory collection of egg rolls, shrimp, honey chicken, fried won ton... and you get to play with fire. Upon completing the platter on our most recent visit, our six year old remarked, "You mean there's more food coming?" Yes there was and she managed to find plenty of room for the Moo Shu Chicken, or what she called her "Chinese burrito". The little ones also love the aquarium situated by the front door and their mom appreciates the clean rest rooms.   If you're looking for trendy, you might think that the China Village dining room could use a bit of an update. A fair observation, I suppose. It's comfy and familiar to us, however, so we hope they don't change a thing.

Love the breakfast at the Ole Brass Rail. Still has a sports bar vibe even in the morning, with ESPN channels broadcasting from every angle. Happily, the breakfast offerings are much higher quality than you might expect at a bar.   Don't be discouraged if the front parking lot is full. There's more parking around the side and back. The interior is larger than what you might think just viewing it from the street. Walk on in and find yourself a table or belly up to the bar.  Friendly servers. Kudos for actually serving bacon crispy when requested. Meals are for the most part a great value. A diverse clientele ranging from retired couples, business owners planning their day, workers on a break, women socializing... and they have table arrangements that can easily handle larger groups. Actually kind of noisy this morning and the coffee refills and check delivery could have been a little more timely. Not a big deal, however, with so many sporting options to view while waiting.  Watch yourself on the way out the front door. The floor is a bit uneven, which could be a problem if you have been emphasizing the "bar" over the "grill". The Ole Brass Rail's décor could be termed sports bar basic, but it matters not. It's a great neighborhood bar and grill that has found a way to succeed even in the morning breakfast hours.

We have used Hung-Rite to replace garage doors at two homes. They were reasonably priced and professional. Since then, they've replaced springs and very recently replaced a garage door opener. I would have liked more opener alternatives, but we felt the need to use them for consistency of future service. They have honored warranty issues over time without resistance. Most importantly, given the negative comments I've seen in some other reviews, the service techs have been courteous and friendly.

Not a fan. I tag along on outings to kid-oriented pizza places quite often. My expectations are low. As long as the young ones have fun, I'm good. Despite this, Peter Piper Pizza found a way to disappoint.  I have posted photos of two pizzas: The California Veggie we received and the promotional photo from which we ordered. No resemblance. Worse still, there was a very bitter aftertaste that made it inedible. Perhaps from the mushrooms? We talked about returning it, but instead just focused on the pepperoni pizza we had also ordered.  The kids? They had fun. But our meal was $60 including game tokens. With inedible pizza, a good family value it was not. The adults went home hungry. Also, there is no salad bar available in the evening; just some prepackaged and expensive mixed lettuce. Where are all the "healthy choices" they advertise?

A PetsHotel specific review:   We've taken the family dog here several times. We first put our toe in the water with a doggie day camp. Our lady, a dainty 100 pound mixed breed who is constantly mistaken for a male despite her pink collar, was hesitant. The staff immediately put her at ease with a little love. Bottom line, the day was a success, although she was happy to be picked up.  Fast forward, a few overnight stays later, she now walks straight to the PetsHotel every time we go to PetSmart. EVERY TIME! When she's actually dropped off, she doesn't even look back at us. What the heck? Shouldn't parting be at least a little traumatic for her?   From a human perspective, no pet hotel is going to be as nice for your dog as staying at home. PetSmart, perhaps motivated by corporate liability concerns, seems to have found a good balance between a desire to treat pets well and a need to keep them safe. We've never had any problems with fighting with other dogs, for example. They are also very serious about making sure that all vaccinations are up to date before your pet is allowed to stay. They also reserve the right to refuse certain breeds, which I suppose could be upsetting if you own a pit bull, but personally I'm fine with them erring on the side of safety. I've talked to a couple of friends who have indicated they would never take their pet to a heartless corporate boarder, but I actually view it as an extra layer of safety for the dogs.  Costs are reasonable. Not the cheapest place you can find, but definitely not as high as some Scottsdale pet resorts. The basic cost is $31 a night, but you'll also likely add a $16 day camp ($4 discount with overnight stay). There is a little bit of silliness, such as applying a little guilt to get you to purchase treats for your pet, but no worse than what you'll find elsewhere. We have actually ordered a nail trim for our girl, let's call it a manicure, during a couple of her stays. They will routinely accommodate you with the day camp if you miss the noon checkout time, which is much cheaper than paying for another night. We also bring our own food to help cost.   They open daily at 7:00 a.m. for drop off, which can be a big help.  They give you a written report of the stay when you pick up your pet. We didn't take it very seriously at first (are they really going to tell you your pet hated staying there?), but we've actually found it to be helpful over time. Toys and leashes we have left have never been lost. Just don't bring rawhide. It's not allowed.  I'd actually give the PetsHotel five stars, but the rating has to be for PetSmart, the store, which I'm a little less enthusiastic about. I can't speak to other locations, since they're only going to be as good as their staffs, but the people at this PetsHotel are great.

10/24/15 Update: After a year of using Banfield, our one year medical plan about to expire, I have a couple of observations. While the veterinarians and staff there are very nice, we have felt that the corporate culture at Banfield was always picking our pocket. Our medical plan never seemed to cover much of it. I also don't care for them pushing to have you drop off your dog for an appointment rather than seeing the veterinarian with your dog. I've lowered the rating from three to two stars and we are giving up some convenience to seek alternative care for our pets.  Original Review: We have a couple of dogs in the family that go to this Banfield for veterinary services. Overall, we've had a decent experience, but some tradeoffs should be noted.  The staff seems caring and thorough, which of course is key. We haven't visited that often, so perhaps that's the reason, but we do tend to see different people, even different veterinarians, with each visit. That's a negative, of course, if you're looking for an old fashioned relationship. It could be viewed as a positive, however, in that they do seem to have strict procedures in place.   Banfield is not the cheapest option around, nor probably the most expensive given the location near P.V. and Scottsdale. They are a bit corporate, pushing medical plans for dogs. We determined that using a plan was a really bad deal for our healthy middle aged dog. Paying piecemeal has been much cheaper given she's a low maintenance pup. For our new canine addition, however, for a puppy needing lots of vaccinations and a neutering, the plan was actually a decent option for the first year of his life. Still, as the puppy has progressed, we feel that we're having our pocket picked on a fairly regular basis with items not covered by the plan.  Truth be known, the real reason we chose Banfield is that we are fans of the PetSmart Pet Hotel and day camp across the lobby. They are meticulous in seeing that all vaccinations are up to date before accepting your pet. Telling them to check with Banfield is so easy.   And we love the location at Tatum and Shea.  Not a perfect solution. An independent vet might be a better choice for many. The corporate nature of Banfield is a negative (marketing oriented/cost of plans) and a positive (quality controls/personnel coverage). Don't automatically sign up for a plan. Consider your needs.   Remember non-profit groups like Home Fur Good (32nd Street and Shea) have cheap vaccination clinics (most Sundays) and even inexpensive micro-chipping if you are on a tight budget.

The people here are amazingly nice. I've visited Gab's (pronounce with a long A) three times now. The first visit was outstanding in every way. Dropped in without an appointment. Taken care of quickly and at a fair price. The second visit? Less outstanding. By appointment, the parts ordered were incorrect and I left without the repair being done. It happens. I understand. A revised estimate for the repair, with the new parts, was more expensive than the original. The largest difference in cost was a jump in labor from $35 to $85. Was the repair more involved than initially expected or was I being asked to pay for the time wasted by their mistake? I'll never really know, but it kind of seems like the latter. I do know a couple hours of my time was wasted. Visited a third time. The repair was promptly made at the appointed time precisely at the estimated cost. Overall, two five star visits and one two star visit.    I like Gab's well enough to give them another try. I like to buy cars new and then fully depreciate them, AKA drive them into the ground, before then buying a new one. I'm at the stage where I'm trying to squeeze another 20,000 or 30,000 miles out of a car before it bites the dust. Having abandoned overpriced Toyota dealer service for the remainder of this car's life, I'm still thinking Gab's may be the honest and affordable repair solution I'm seeking.

It's a Subway. No need to comment about the food. But the servers, let's call them sandwich artists, are friendly and fast at this location, deserving of a review. I've come here for years. The faces change, but the service is quite consistent, indicating this franchise is well managed. I've also witnessed them using temperature probes on more than one occasion, testing the safety of their meats... reassuring. About to walk into The Oink Cafe next door? Perhaps pass on the bacon and opt for a healthier choice at Subway.

Lauren is awesome. She stayed late with us tonight when we rudely showed up at 5:58 p.m., two minutes before closing, to sign some papers. Five stars.  The employees at this branch are very friendly and helpful. Generally young and energetic. The member focused, non profit, orientation of the credit union really shines through here. Five stars.  The only negative? No drive thru at this branch. One star. There is, however, an ATM out front you can use if you don't mind getting out of your car.  If you're not familiar with credit unions in general, they can be a good alternative to big banks for individual consumers. They will make you open a $25 minimum savings account to become a member, kind of silly, but it's something the regulators require. They're non profit, but they still have to cover the cost of salaries, rent, computers... Still, there's a chance they may offer better deposit and loan rates than the big banks. Sometimes they're not as efficient, or lag in adoption of technology, but they usually make up for it with friendlier, less adversarial service. Not a bad trade off.

We have been patients, er, clients, of All Creatures Animal Clinic for years. Not consecutively. They compassionately helped us with our aging Australian Shepard mix years ago. More recently they have been helping us with Teddy Wagadoodle, our young Labradoodle. There was also a Guinea Pig who needed some special care. Not even sure what else. "All Creatures" means all creatures!   Pricing at All Creatures is very reasonable, especially in comparison to the misguided year we just spent at Banfield. I'm not sure what we were thinking. Well, I do know. We fell victim to a special offer. So happy to be back at All Creatures. The staff is uniformly friendly, thoughtful and calming. The level of veterinary care is exceptional. Nothing more need be said.  An added bonus. All Creatures is right next door to a good dog groomer and a great breakfast spot, the 40th Street Café. Only one problem, the café does not allow dogs. Fortunately, the groomer and All Creatures do.

We had planned on eating a late breakfast at the Original Breakfast House just down 32nd Street, but did not realize that they would be closed for Labor Day. We headed north toward the Harkins North 16 Cinema and stumbled upon Denny's.  We still had plenty of time before our movie, or so we thought.  The entryway was warm and crowded with people waiting.  Only a ten minute wait was indicated, so we decided to stay.  When we were seated, we noticed the restaurant itself seemed a bit warm as well.  We waited a very long time just to have our presence recognized by a server.  Eventually, beverage orders were taken.  Coffee was delivered without an offer of creamer and we labored another five minutes just to make eye contact with anyone who could bring us some.  Food orders were finally taken and were served in a reasonable amount of time, although there was a significant amount of time between when the first person in our party and the last was served.  Not a big deal, but it's awkward to postpone eating until everyone is served and awkward when they insist that you go ahead and eat.  Well, it's Denny's.  The food was fine.  Uninspired.  Just what you'd expect.  Given that you can eat at a really good breakfast joint just a few blocks away, however, I'm just not sure why you'd want to settle for this.  I'm pleased that the Original Breakfast House treats their employees well with the day off, but I doubt that I would ever head back to Denny's anytime OBH was open.  By the time we were finishing, we had used all of our available time and felt as though we'd been eating in a sauna.  The restaurant never cooled down.  Not revealed to us when we checked in was the not insignificant fact that their air conditioning was broken.  Not all of their air conditioning.  Only the part where their patrons were seated.  Revealing this tidbit of information to customers when they came in the door would have been the honorable thing to do.  Yes, we probably would have elected to go elsewhere, but it's what any good restaurant would do for their customers.  But not Denny's.        This Denny's is nice in appearance and some employees seem well intentioned.  When you are serving "average" food, however, it's critical that employees and managers go above and beyond to compensate. That did not happen on this day.  Not even close.

If you're an English only sort of person, Gorditas El Tio is probably not for you. For me, this most recent visit was an opportunity to bone up on my Spanish by watching a Spanish language version of Peoples Court on their television. Something about $2,000 in damages and a woman wronged. Guess it's back to Rosetta Stone for me.  The menu board is in Spanish, with some English. The frequent visitor punch cards (buy five combo plates, get one free) have one side in Spanish and one in English. The television is tuned into a Spanish language channel. And your order will be likely be taken by a person for whom English is clearly a second language. In other words, perfect! It's a Mexican restaurant for heavens sake!   You order at the counter and they call out when your food is ready. Language is really not an issue. You'll have twenty, yes twenty, value combinations from which to choose. Don't be worried when you see no salsa bar and only ketchup and pepper sauce on the tables. You'll receive bottles of serviceable red and green sauce when your food is ready. I do wish they had the beverage machine in front of the counter instead of in back. Oh well. Not a big thing. The menu is extensive and the food is solid. The $1.35 mini tacos, for example, are quite generous. They also have a $3.99 menu para ninos.   The décor is very basic. A taco shop sort of vibe, but with a much more complete menu. Service is not ultra fast, but your food will be hot and fresh when delivered to you.

Maybe four stars. Maybe five stars. Can't decide. Guess I'll just have to come back again and again to figure it out.  It's easy to drive by this little gem. It's wedged in a strip mall between a pet groomer and a pack and ship store. You'll likely miss the "cafe" signage your first time here, but your persistence will be rewarded. It's been hiding here for 21 years!  Very small, with a great Midwestern family sort of vibe. Owner is named Peggy. Friendly waitresses who know the names of all their regulars. But don't worry, they'll be friendly to you as well. And their names are printed on their shirts, so you can call them by name if you'd like. Walk on in and seat yourself.  Look for a clipboard posted outside on a column to sign yourself in during busy times.  Tables are squeezed into a very tight space, really my only complaint, with no table seating more than four. But they'll move tables around for you if you're a bigger party. My "neighbors" this day included a dad with a preschooler, a couple of Iowa snowbirds, and some millennials dining after a workout. All friendly.  And kid friendly! Crayons. Kids Meals start at $1.50, although $2.95 is the likely amount to be spent. But the big win, at least according to the five and six year old who often accompany me out, is the chocolate chip cookie on a stick you receive if you finish your meal. What could be better than topping off a pancake breakfast with a chocolate chip cookie? Well...  No, they're not dog friendly, even with limited outside seating. Don't judge, though. It's easy to understand why there have been past problems with both a dog groomer and a veterinarian located next door.  Oh yes, the adult food. I can really only speak to their breakfasts, which I love. Look for the specials posted on a whiteboard above a cooler in the back of the cafe. Great breakfast deals M-F until 11:00. Then a lunch special kicks in.   They don't know my name yet, but I suspect they will soon.

Carlos is the man.  He's worked here for seventeen years and he will make sure you have a good experience.  5 and Diner is a great choice for families.  The fifties themed decor is fun for all.  Just wish the juke box system worked. On my most recent visit I had to try to explain the concept of a hula hoop to a three year old.  Since a demonstration was out of the question, I'm afraid this little one will have to wait for later clarification.  She did enjoy coloring the paper hat the restaurant provided, however, and her folks enjoyed the $2.75 price tag on the generous junior pancake breakfast.  The menu also features a separate section for seniors.  While technically you have to be fifty-five to order from this section of the menu, in my experience servers will allow anyone who would prefer these smaller portions and prices to order them.  A note about prices.  While the kids menu prices are very reasonable, select off menu junior beverages are a bit pricey (juice $1.79) and can drive up your total cost.  There is also a loyalty card that will help stretch the dollar of frequent diners.  The Southwest Omelet was perfect on our recent visit and definitely worth a taste.  The pancakes were uniform and served hot. In all honesty, however, it's the decor and the friendly staff that earns the restaurant four stars in this review. Menu offerings are solid, with a few amusing names scattered throughout, but are for the most part predictable and basic.  But come to think about it, isn't that what you want from a fifties diner?  Even though 5 and Diner is not a "genuine" fifties diner, instead an Arizona based chain's recreation of the era, it seems genuine enough.  I've noticed that several locations have closed in recent years, but the PV location seems to be unaffected and thriving.

I only tend to notice an airport when I have had a horrible experience. Even then, it's usually the weather or an airline or the TSA that was the source of the problem.   Sky Harbor is large and impersonal, but it makes an effort to make time spent here less painful.   The recent upgrade in food options, including local phoenix options, is a huge improvement. Matt's, Lo-Lo's... though still overpriced for the captive audience.  The Sky Train, which connects the three terminals at a cost of over a billion dollars (not a joke), is great entertainment for kids and helpful for travelers switching airlines. A billion plus dollars entertaining and helpful? Well...  Also, there are some interesting art installations scattered around the airport. Keep an eye out for them.  Sky Harbor has three terminals (2,3,4) and the distances, even within terminals (Terminal 4), can be large. The Sky Train and conveyor walkways help, but allow extra time. Terminal One was closed years ago, so don't let that confuse you. Too bad. It would be a popular mid-century modern destination if it were still in existence today.

Stopped by Godar Electronics today with some electronics in need of attention prior to sale. It's a sign you're getting older when the amplifier you bought in college is now vintage and collectible. Oh well. I called Mike Godar in advance of my visit, so I knew what to expect. Or at least I thought I did. The quoted price, $135, was quite a bit more than the $80 or so I had expected. Apparently my internal pricing mechanism is now vintage as well. A quality repair, however, was needed if I was to sell the amp on eBay for top dollar. Instead, when I arrived Mike surprised me by making a cash offer for the amp on the spot. I negotiated a $75 improvement in his offer and decided to go ahead take it. He'll double his money and I'll avoid a repair bill, another trip to Gilbert, a time consuming eBay listing and the joy of figuring out how to inexpensively ship an amp that is roughly the same weight as a Volkswagen. Everyone wins, but I can't help but think that the original $135 repair estimate was just a little expensive and a factor in my decision to sell. Mike seemed to be a stand up guy during the actual purchase negotiation, however, quoting online price listings consistent with those with which I was familiar. I'd award him 4.5 stars if I could.  The shop is fun to visit. Lots of old radios, turntables, amplifiers... piled all about. I'm not sure how much longer Godar will be here. It's across the street from some spots like the Barrio Queen and the location must have real estate developers salivating. There aren't that many places in town that fix vintage electronics. Let's hope Mike is around a bit longer.

A must see attraction if you are visiting Scottsdale with young kids in tow. Also a great place for locals to host a birthday party, picnic or let the kids run off some steam.   The main attraction is the train, free for kids three and under and one ticket (6 for $10) for everyone else. A $10 all day wrist band is also available. Just be prepared to scream at the top of your lungs when you go through the train tunnel. Secondary attractions are the carousel, a museum, a smaller steam train that operates limited hours, a great playground, and assorted jails... to climb on. There are also snack options available.   Operated by the City of Scottsdale, the RR Park is really just an elaborate city park. An amazing city park! It's not a full fledged amusement park. You'll be disappointed if that's what you're expecting. Your kids will need to run around and create some fun on their own, which I suspect they happily will do if left to their own devices.

This 5 & Diner, located in the Scottsdale Pavilions, has a lot going for it. There's a nice outdoor patio which is hula hoop (provided) and dog (not provided) friendly. It's located very close to the ball park. There's also the classic car show at McDonalds across the drive every Saturday. The 1950's theme of the restaurant is fun, especially for kids. The menu is classically diverse and the food is solid. It's a great place for a classic breakfast or just an ice cream treat. They have separate kids and seniors menus, which can help make a visit very reasonably priced. Servers are generally very prompt and very friendly.  Why not five stars? We visited recently at an off time and the counter area was blocked off, a big disappointment for our young companions who wanted to sit there. The table jukebox system no longer works, although there is a central jukebox that is in working order. The classic menu doesn't contain any items that would interest a true foodie. I'm fine with that, but it should be mentioned for those in that category. Overall, though, 5 & Diner is a fun experience, especially if you embrace your inner hula hooping self.

I've used this Brake Masters location many times over the years. Amazingly, I have not once felt that I was being ripped off, a feeling common with most auto repairs.   This visit was for a warranty check in advance of selling a car. It was a great a opportunity for Brake Masters to push for some non warranty work on us. They did not. Awesome. I also requested an express oil change. I forgot to present my coupon at checkout and then noticed that they had applied the discount anyway. Even more awesome.  Also, I did not have the paperwork for the original brake repair done years ago in Tucson. I called in advance and they were able to look it up our warranty and they honored it without any hassle.  It has to be difficult to maintain an honest culture within the auto repair industry, but this Brake Masters seems to have found the right balance.

I'm going to focus largely on breakfast in this review and I'll admit to being a little sentimental in writing it.  I'm suffering from a bad case of burger fatigue. That said, Whataburger serves a quality (for fast food) burger. If you're complaining, with all the options Whataburger offers, you just didn't order it correctly. I always ask for grilled onions.  Breakfast is served until 11:00 a.m. What distinguishes Whataburger from other fast food breakfasts is their limited use of the microwave oven. Order pancakes, and you will receive pancakes freshly prepared on the spot, not pulled out of a freezer and zapped. Since they operate more like an old style short order cook, they'll customize virtually anything for you. Want your bacon crisp? No problem. Want a side of scrambled eggs? No worries.  The people at this location are very nice. I used to take my mother here for breakfast 2-3 times a week when she was a snowbird. She loved the free senior coffee and we'd split a meal. Always out the door for $6-8, which is what a nice breakfast for two cost in 1973, the benchmark year to which she seems to compare prices. The staff would often help me with her wheelchair and engage her small talk, a big deal when you're disabled. I was surprised, well maybe not that surprised, to see one of the same nice servers still there on this recent visit.   It's also great that you can settle in and read... while waiting for your breakfast to be prepared. They deliver it hot to your table when ready. It may take a minute or two longer than the microwave competitors, but it's worth it. The dining room is also much more relaxing since they updated it and said goodbye to the Whataburger orange and blue!  A five star Whataburger location. At best a three star restaurant, typical of fast food. Throw in a dash of sentiment and this Whataburger earns a four star rating overall.

I am not Armenian. I have never attended this church. But I love ArmeniaFest, the church's annual fundraiser.   ArmeniaFest is not a major country specific event on a par with the annual Scottish & Highland Games at Steele Indian School Park for example, so don't get your hopes up. It is, however, a phenomenal event when viewed in the context of a small church fundraiser.   Great regional food served by actual Armenians! Highly recommended. Just $2 for adults to get in the door. Kids free. There was a bit of a wait in line for food, but we didn't mind because of the live entertainment going on in the background. Our multigenerational group ordered a variety of items, feeling a bit like we were traveling to a foreign country when we tried pronounce our selections. Fantastic. Loved everything.  After our main course we also sampled the dessert pastries, purchasing a small package of pretty much everything they offered. We took them to go and then celebrated an Armenian evening at home.   Did I mention they had cotton candy for the kids? A friendly server made an extra one, free of charge, for our second child so the two didn't have to share. How nice!  We will definitely be back. I'll need the year, however, to work on my Armenian pronunciations!

Absolutely love Chaparral Homemade Ice Cream. Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon at about 2:30 only to surprised by live music. The kindergartener in our group whispered, "They're real cowboys - I can tell by their hats." The singers were very friendly, engaging the kids in their performance. So much fun.  And the ice cream? Homemade. Had to taste the prickly pear, but we opted for maple pecan, boysenberry and chocolate. All wonderful. They also have a full breakfast  menu and an assortment of sandwiches and pizzas. Family owned. Seating indoors and outdoors.  We will definitely return for the ice cream and the entertainment. And maybe one day even a sandwich.

I've flown US Airways three times in the past four months. All three flights experienced significant delays, two for mechanical reasons. Things happen, but the way they are handled matter. When AmericaWest acquired US Airways, the toxic US Airways culture won out. Will history repeat with the American merger?  This time it's weather causing the problem. Can't blame US Airways for that. A worst in the airline industry phone app, however, makes things worse. An 800 number with endless automated questions ending in a "call back later" and disconnect (you'd say they hung up on you if it was a person) due to the high volume of calls makes things worse still. I'm sure folks with better technology and more nimble fingers outmaneuvered me, but when did receiving airline customer service become a technology based meritocracy? Actually it's been a while. I've been on the winning side a time or two also. Still, US Airways/American management is relentlessly selfish and not at all customer driven, a philosophy that permeates every level of the company.

3TV is an independent television station, not affiliated with any major network. They use that independence well, not just delivering a steady stream of Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, but producing nearly ten hours of local news programming each day.   I especially love their support of so many local causes such as the Arizona Humane Society.

To quote the four year old who joined me on my recent visit to The Fry Bread House, "I like it so much I'd like to eat here every day for forever." My sentiment exactly, although the caloric level of the food would probably not allow it. Limited to a dozen tables, none of which seats more than four, you place your order at the counter and wait for your name to be called.  No worries.  The fare is not the type that demands a high priced decor and table service.  A different type of service is evident. A three time a week regular joined the line behind me and was presented with his food without even having to place his order.  Impressive.    The menu is far more diverse than just fry bread covered with honey or powdered sugar, although you will probably want to have some for dessert.  Fry bread is also utilized in a wide variety of combinations of beans, beef, pork and chile, with recipes rooted in the tribal traditions of the Tohono O'odham.  And the desserts include a killer chocolate concoction. Our table seemed to love anything that included green chile.  The children's entrees were reasonably priced ($4.25 including drink) and include a tasty open fry bread covered with melted cheese and small fry bread "diskettes" intended to be dipped in refried beans.   While a regular loyal clientele seems to dominate those present on most days, the restaurant is a great choice for visitors to Arizona interested in sampling a superior quality fry bread and some genuinely regional cuisine. Native American crafts are often on sale outside the restaurant, adding to the experience.  Good news for fans of The Fry Bread House:  the restaurant will soon be moving to a larger location 17 blocks down Indian School Road (1003 E. Indian School Road).

After years of long waits for appointments and expensive exams with an ophthalmologist, I finally opted for the ease of visiting an optometrist at Costco. My shopping philosophy has always been, "If you can't buy it at Home Depot or Costco, you probably don't need it," so at least I'm being consistent. And my preference for an MD over an OD has waned as technology at everyone's disposal has improved. Thus, Dr. Bonnin. I've been seeing him for annual check ups for a few years and could not be happier. He's an older fellow and is especially good dealing with questions involving aging eyes... he's been there. His work week is limited, so I've also seen others in the office with good results.   By the way, I recommend that you consider doing the retinal scan at least once to create a recorded benchmark for the health of your eyes. It's relatively inexpensive and it is much more than a sales tactic for a pretty picture as was implied by another reviewer (my motive for writing this review). Extremely important if you have concerns about issues like macular degeneration...   And yes, my wife, who strongly disagrees with my whole Home Depot/Costco shopping philosophy, now sees Dr. Bonnin as well.

No applesauce given with the kids meals. "We don't do that anymore." But it's on the menu as part of the meal. Isn't this deceptive advertising? No substitution offered (even when asked for). No apology given (didn't even occur to them). And they still charge the full $4.99 for a kids meal missing one of its five items. Also, no Capri Sun as advertised; instead, just a soft drink.  Expect to go back to the counter to beg for butter, honey and dipping sauces, since none are offered or included. You'll have to wait, though, while other customers debate the accuracy of their orders and their billings. The one and a half star average Yelp rating for this establishment is clearly not just the result of one or two disgruntled reviewers. I saw no happy diners on this visit.  I suggest you visit another KFC that has more honest management and more considerate employees. My expectations for fast food are always pretty modest, but I would never expect to feel as though I had been rudely conned and cheated. I did at this KFC.

01/23/2015 Update: Oh no!!! The Big Apple is closing to make room for parking for Gateway Community College. Sounds like a bad parody of an old Joni Mitchell song, but I'm afraid it's true. Fortunately, we have a two year window before it closes for good. First Monte's, now Bill Johnson's. Aargh!!!    I love Bill Johnson's Big Apple. The home of the best business street sign in all of Phoenix. Worth a trip by itself. And the food isn't bad either. A perfect spot to bring your winter visitors from the Midwest.  It's clear that this restaurant, which has been a Phoenix staple since the mid-1950's, is getting a little long in the tooth. A framed review on the way to the restroom says it all. Voted Best BBQ by the Arizona Republic - in 1991. I do like their BBQ sauce. It's sold in grocery stores, so apparently a lot of other folks like it as well. Not your BBQ of choice, however, if you like your BBQ trendy.   I remember when servers at Bill Johnson's always wore holsters (actually kind of miss them) and there was sawdust spread on the floor (don't miss that at all). In many respects, however, the rest of the restaurant is frozen in time. And you know what? I don't mind a bit. I love it!   I've always been partial to their breakfast, which is served until 11:00 a.m. Also very kid friendly (ask for a balloon), with a simple and good kids menu (photo attached). At other times of day, they have a great selection of reasonably priced burgers. Served somewhere else you'd consider them to be gourmet. I like the option, stated on the menu so you don't have to negotiate, to change out the hamburger for grilled chicken at no extra cost.   Some Big Apple locations have closed in recent years, so I'm making a point to support this one. Hope you do too. It's part of Phoenix history.

We had a blast during our recent visit to Enchanted Island. This small amusement park is a long-time Phoenix fixture that still has a lot of entertainment value left in it. It's located within Encanto Park, a City of Phoenix public park.  A few cautionary comments are in order:  Enchanted Island is showing its age, but you won't mind if you take a nostalgic view.  It's small and oriented toward smaller children. There's not much to do if you're age eight or older, but it's perfect if you are five or six.  Go ahead and pop for the $17 unlimited ride wrist bands. Rides require 2-3 tickets each, so tickets do not go nearly as far as you'd think. Plus, repeat rides are a must if lines are short as they often are.   Rides include a train, a carousel, bumper boats, airplanes, helicopters, a dragon coaster, water pistols, spinners, cars, parachutes... that's about it. Mostly vintage. All fun. There is also a snack bar on the premises.   While you're at Enchanted Island, don't forget to wander about Encanto Park. Lots of bridges, fish, ducks, swings... enough to hold the attention of any little one.

Simply the best place for a homeowner to buy citrus trees in the valley.  Trees are locally grown. Arizona soil. Arizona climate. Makes a huge difference. Speaking of huge, the root balls are larger than those of trees sold at most non-specialty retailers. The larger ball adds to the challenge of transporting and planting, but it helps the tree get established much faster. The trees pictured in the photograph posted range roughly in price from $65 to $85, very fair for a superior product. You'll also be able to select from multiple varieties of lemons, oranges and grapefruit, not just from one or two. The staff, you may be talking to an owner, are very knowledgeable, and will talk you through specific advantages and disadvantages of each variety. There are significant differences not just in fruit, but tolerance to sun, speed of growth, and so on.   Greenfield Citrus Nursery is locally owned. There are live peacocks and chickens wandering about the property. This day, we just dropped in just to see the birds. The kids loved it. The staff was not at all annoyed and seemed pleased when we told them the three trees we had purchased from them were thriving.   One more thing. You don't have to buy a tree. If you aren't able to buy all the fruit you want at the Orange Patch next door, there are often lemons, oranges and grapefruit for sale very cheaply at Greenfield's.

Such a fun little spot to buy local citrus. Perfect for winter visitors to Arizona. Also a great place to go if you want to taunt your friends and relatives who live in colder climates. You can ship them fresh Arizona oranges and grapefruit direct from the Orange Patch. I've also had them prepare a box for me to take on an airline flight, complete with a twine handle.  Samples are always available, which is very helpful when there are multiple similar varieties from which to choose. The staff is very accommodating, often able to assemble customized bags and boxes of citrus on the spot. The store itself is very cute. Kind of an old west feel. They also sell candy and nuts and honey and so on, as well as ice cream. There's even a small seating area in a corner of the store in which you can enjoy your purchases.  Out back you'll find orange trees and a very clean freestanding restroom. While construction of the 202 Red Mountain Freeway wiped out much of the citrus right behind the store, you'll still get a sense of being in an orange grove, especially if you're a kid. While you're in the area, stop in at the Greenfield Citrus Nursery next door. They have live peacocks and chickens wandering about the premises, entertaining for kids and adults alike.

It's a Dairy Queen. No surprises, negative or positive, regarding the food.   Service is friendly. The facilities are clean and well kept. The décor? Dairy Queen circa 1975, with 1980's high school cafeteria influences. Hard benches and chairs... not a great atmosphere in which to sit and linger. Perhaps it does have some retro appeal, but it is a little surprising that the owners have chosen not to upgrade the interior given their prime Scottsdale location.   No matter. As long as the ice cream is served cold and the employees remain welcoming, this Dairy Queen deserves its success.

If, like me, you are trapped as a Cox customer, this store is probably a better choice than most Cox locations. Still, I had a deceptive hour wait my last visit, only to be sold a defective router/modem. It happens, I suppose. Returned the unit 18 days later only to see they are now carrying a different brand. Hmm. At least the wait was shorter and the installation quicker this time. A total of more than three hours of my time wasted just trying to maintain my internet service.   Hey Cox. Transparent pricing would be great. How about no longer giving discounts to new customers and screwing your existing ones? Why knowingly break new customers' budgets with plans they can't afford when promotional discounts end? Why not stop offering free premium cable for just a month or two or three to trick your customers into paying extra for channels they do not want or need? And why keep using unreliable independent contractors for service calls? I'll answer. Cox is not your friend in the internet age. They are not interested in quality of service. They are interested only in squeezing cash out of a slowing dying business model. Watch your billings.

We had pretty much decided buy a Kia Sorento. Mark Kia was the first of two negative experiences at Kia dealerships that caused us to change our mind.  Be aware that new car prices quoted on the internet by Mark Kia are misleading. Among other things, they assume you are going to qualify for every rebate available, including recent college graduate and military rebates. Clearly a tactic to get you in the door. Not the way I would do business, but not a deal breaker.   We made a same day appointment (through the internet) to test drive a car that was perfect for us. We received a confirmation and a notice that we had been handed off to another fellow shortly before our appointment. Not ideal, but not a deal breaker.  When we arrived, they were unable to locate the car in question. Understand, this is not a huge dealership. Never explained, but it became apparent that they knew the car was not there and they had mislead us to get us in the door and show us other cars. We did look and then received a push to start the price haggling process on a car we were not thrilled about. The entire reason to enter a dealership via the internet with advance pricing is to avoid the haggle. That concept has apparently not reached Scottsdale Road. Cars on the lot were obscenely marked up with dealer add-ons and a random $1,500 regional adjustment?!? For example, an $18,000 MSRP Kia Soul was marked up to $22,000! Setting a higher price from which to start negotiations I suppose. No thank you, Mark Kia.  My daughter told me not to buy a car from Mark due to a reality television show a few years ago that featured an obscene sweet sixteen birthday party for Mark's daughter. I remembered the show and laughed off the advice. I should have listened to my daughter, however, and not had my time wasted by this dealer's runaround. Misleading online prices, deceptive inventory practices and "Marked Up" prices. Three strikes.

Really appreciated finding this spot, with the help of Yelp, while stranded in the area. Yes, it's a basic burrito/taco joint, but the quality of its food is definitely above many of its competitors.   My first selection was a chicken taco. Didn't really expect much. I was delighted to receive a taco stuffed with shredded white chicken, not the "are you sure this is chicken?" mixture you sometimes receive elsewhere. The chicken wasn't really that well seasoned, but you can spice to taste with a salsa bar that is stocked with red sauce, green sauce and veggies. The menu has a lot of variety, much more than the establishment's name would imply. Burritos, tacos, tortas, enchiladas, tostadas, chimichangas, quesadillas... and great combination plates priced mostly around seven dollars.   The dining room is minimal, in both size and décor, just as it should be. There is a shaded outdoor patio with additional seating.  The staff is friendly and food is quickly prepared. There is also a drive thru. Located near SkySong, Fiesta Burrito is wedged in among some other restaurants, fast food and otherwise. Open for breakfast and late night.

Five stars belatedly awarded for years of history and great food. Sadly, November 17th is Monte's last day, a victim of "progress".   I understand they're going to leave the oldest part of the structure in place and demolish the rest. A live auction of 80% of the contents will occur in early December, at least according to conversations we overheard.  A word of warning. They are booked. No more reservations to be had and walking in will require a wait or be unsuccessful. Ignore the sign, put in your name and hope for the best.  Another word of warning. They're having staffing issues in advance of closing. They've also had delivery issues, actually closing early as they've run out of food. An unfortunate end for an Arizona institution. Certainly the remaining employees deserve better. I can't imagine being the poor receptionist giving the bad news to customer after long time customer. We actually witnessed a failed attempt at a bribe/tip (seemed like a bribe) to get in.  All that said, our server persevered and was rewarded this meal with a large tip. And our food was well worth the wait. Goodbye Monte's. Sad to see you go. You're irreplaceable.

A good place to stop in Gila Bend if, well, you must stop in Gila Bend. As a regular of the Phoenix to San Diego and back crowd, I'll confess that I usually think of Gila Bend only as a rest room stop or at best a source of fast food. Every once in a while, however, you crave a little more and the Space Age Restaurant delivers nicely.  It is much more contemporary than you would think, given the funky architecture of the adjoining Space Age Lodge. The reason? A fire many years ago. After the fire struck, they placed a banner out front maintaining that they had been attacked by aliens. You have to admire a sense of humor in adversity. I just wish I'd been able to dine in the original restaurant, with its original space décor.   This version of the Space Age Restaurant neatly features modern space themed murals, friendly servers, decent food and yes, since it's in Gila Bend, clean rest rooms.   Breakfast can be dominated by folks staying at the neighboring lodge, vouchers in hand, but on a recent visit we noted many locals. The look of the salad bar was a surprise, a surprise in that it looked very good. We stuck with breakfast offerings, even though it was later in the day. Solid. Basic. No surprises. Service could have been a little faster, given that we were on the road and anxious to get going, but nothing to really complain about. A good experience overall.  And did I mention the nice rest rooms?

I'm a fan. A Mexican restaurant I can take my in-laws from New Mexico to without embarrassment. Yes, Los Dos Molinos does bring the heat, but they assist you by spice indications on the menu and by friendly help when ordering. My advice? Embrace the heat. Rules of thumb? The red salsa is hot. The green salsa is not. The green sauce is hot. The red sauce is not. I hope that's clear :) Better ask your server if you're truly adverse to spicy food.  I love the New Mexico influences: The random fried eggs. The quality red and green chile smothering every burrito and enchilada. The heat.     The kids menu is great, with a lot of choices. Some items seem a little expensive at first reading, but they are worth the price.   The restaurant itself is bright and colorful, but basic. A true hole in the wall. I drove right by it the first time I visited. It's easy to see in the daylight, but it's difficult to spot at night. Just trust Google if you're arriving after dark. The prices are very reasonable and the service is very friendly and attentive.   A bonus: There's a Yelp deal for a free cheese crisp as of this date.

As my daughter would say, "It's all about the Baja sauce!"  To be honest, I've never been a huge fan of Macayo's, surprising since I've eaten there so many times through the years. My reasons for coming back? It's comfortable. It's convenient. It works well for multi-generational family gatherings. It's a great place for a birthday (free dessert and server serenade). Chips and salsa are prompt and plentiful. And it's not bad. Just ask for a side of Baja sauce with anything you order and you'll be fine.  The Scottsdale location is very nice, nicer than most Macayo's. The structure was specifically built for Macayo's and it shows. There's a patio, bar area and inside seating. It use to be much cuter, with a colorful menagerie of animals placed up in the rafters, but it remains attractive. Still, our family still misses the animals.  Speaking of families, the $4.69 kid's meals were a big hit in our most recent visit. Actually one meal, a mini combo platter, that a four and a five year old shared. They've also enjoyed constructing chicken tacos in the past. A meal that's also an activity! Once again, one kid's meal served two young children nicely.  We also have a habit of ordering appetizers as entrees. On this particular night, two of the six in our party ordered the mini chimis as their meal. With Baja sauce on the side (of course) instead of sour cream. Both also opted for a mix of both chicken and beef chimis. The Baja (of course) pizza appetizer is also a good choice.  One suggestion if you are a first timer: Ask for hot sauce when your chips are delivered. It won't be offered, but it is happily served. This sauce is a nice contrast to Macayo's normal mild salsa. The hot sauce is tasty and is sold in many local grocery stores, even Costco on occasion, so you know it has some merit..  With kids sharing meals and adults ordering appetizers, our dinner tab was very reasonable. It could easily balloon, of course, if you ordered more and added Margaritas... Given its Scottsdale location, the cost could be much worse.  Perhaps not a destination in and of itself, but Macayo's is a good place to enjoy friends and family.

I've frequented Bookman's for many years. First on visits to Tucson. Then Mesa. Now Phoenix. The stores have varying layouts. They seem to take different items in trade and have different pricing for trade and merchandise. Some have more activities. But they share a common struggle. The need to evolve as the world goes digital.   We've noted some major changes over time. A shift away from books as physical books fade away, to CD's and DVD's only to see them fade, to video games, to musical instruments, to electronics and to even more random trade items to survive. Even exercise equipment in Tucson. Trade value has become a little less generous, particularly on books, and pricing of merchandise has become a little more aggressive. Clearly an attempt to maintain profit margins. So far, so good, with the transition. Let's hope they're successful.  The store itself remains a lot of fun. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. Large selections in adult books, kid's books, CD's, DVD's, video games and musical instruments, as well as the random poster, puzzle and collectible.

It's been a few years since I've been to this annual event. The good news is that the number of food booths and merchandise vendors has increased in number and quality. The bad news is that the event is perhaps becoming a victim of its own success, very nearly outgrowing its location.   I love the fact that so many local restaurants have set up booths and that other food vendors earmark proceeds for charity. Very hot and crowded this day, however, with very long lines for much of the food. The food is not that cheap for the most part and it's unlikely that you'll find a true bargain among the imported merchandise, but did you really expect anything different at an event like this? The food is varied and enjoyable and there is merchandise you won't see everyday, at least not in downtown Phoenix. Need a Bonsai tree? Not everything offered is genuinely Japanese, but it bothers me not as long as there is fun to be had.  There is an arts and craft setup for the kids ($1 donation), but no large play area. Entertainment was solid during the time we were at the festival (three stages!!!). Lots of families in attendance. Lots of dogs. Lots of people dressed up as their favorite Anime characters. Very fun. Even though there is no admission charge for the festival, parking in downtown Phoenix can be a hassle or expensive. We chose to simply park a couple of blocks away for free (to the north and east) and enjoyed a leisurely walk with the dogs to the festival.   We attended the annual Phoenix Chinese Week festival just a couple of weekends ago at Hance Park. Matsuri has the more diverse food, vending and entertainment of the two Asian festivals, but we had a much more relaxing time at Chinese Week. Less crowded and more for young kids to do (bouncy houses). There is, however, more choice in entertainment for older kids and adults at Matsuri. Personal preference. Good food and friendly people at both events.  We intend to return to both.

The décor at Eden's Grill is basic, but the food is anything but. This is quality Mediterranean dining, as evidenced by walls lined with New Times Best of Phoenix awards from years past. The pita bread is fresh and the portions served are huge. You rarely see a party leaving without at least one or two containers of leftovers. Many regulars evident. There is a small outdoor dining area. Not sure if its dog friendly, but I suspect it may be only reluctantly.  I don't care for the five dollar fee to split an entre. Most dinner entrees are about fifteen bucks and the serving sizes are large, so sharing is a rationale approach for all but the most robust of appetites. Also don't expect a warm welcome if you try to order portions of the menu al a carte. I think it's fine to bring your kids here, but I don't sense that kids are encouraged. They did throw in extra pita bread upon request with our leftovers on a recent visit. Nice. Any complaints are really very minor in comparison to the strengths of the restaurant.   This small family owned and operated establishment is definitely worth experiencing.

Beam me up Scotty. How can you not like a stadium that looks like an alien space craft? Or that is named after a university that has no sports teams?  The sight lines are great. The concessions are just okay. The AC is wonderful when the heat is on outside. And natural grass! Parking, especially exiting the stadium, can be a challenge. The jumbo screens have been upgraded in the past year. Nice! A few too many highly intoxicated folks at football games, a common NFL problem not unique to Phoenix. Location, location, location. Ideal if you live in East L.A.  Sure, it's not Dallas Cowboy Stadium, but the Cardinals are hosting the Super Bowl this year and the Cowboys are not. Deservedly so. As it should be.

Wells Fargo Arena is an older venue in need of a significant facelift. It's a time capsule that hasn't changed much since its ASU Activity Center days. Incremental changes have been made over the years to (barely) maintain its relevancy. Fortunately, it should soon be seeing some money from the newly created ASU Athletic Facilities District to help with some serious upgrades.  But do less than up-to-date amenities really matter? I say "no." The arena has a fantastic location at ASU and near light rail. Perfect size, much more intimate than US Airways Center. Great college sports. I highly recommend sports such as women's volleyball or women's basketball, which allow you to get up close and personal at a value price. For the price of one Phoenix Suns game, you can take the kids to half a dozen games at Wells Fargo!

I love 5th Avenue Café, starting with the friendly staff. Chances are you'll be warmly greeted by Dawn, one half of the husband and wife ownership team. Then a parade of servers will make sure your order is promptly taken, your coffee and water promptly refilled and your dishes promptly cleared.  The location is good, especially convenient for anyone working or visiting St. Joseph's hospital right across the street. It's also historical. The restaurant originally operated as Upton's (established 1955), a well known dining spot for politicians and celebrities back in the day.  The food is great. Breakfast and lunch. One in our party this day mentioned that the Top of the Morning Omelette was the best omelette she had eaten in ages. The pancakes are light and fluffy. The coffee is served black and hot. Unique requests are happily honored. Specials are posted on a chalk board behind the counter. Mimosas available!  The ambiance is that of a simple diner. Not trendy. Not industrial. Not mid-century modern. It's comfy. The 5th Avenue Café is a locally owned neighborhood restaurant that serves classic comfort food. Expect friendly people, advertisements embedded in the tables and delicious food.

What can I say? I confess. I like Taco Bell. Usually not a Yelp check-in worthy event though. Definitely not review worthy. Except tonight.   The workers on this visit were simply awesome. How often can you say that about a fast food restaurant? I eat at this Taco Bell fairly often, usually just running in for the quick and cheap $2.99 meal deal (a best buy, hard to find on the menu board), motivated by a dining room that is really nice compared to most Taco Bells.  On this night I was accompanied by extended family. Two unexpected things happened. First, I was offered an unexpected discount. Nice! Second, we were given some free cinnamon twists, prompted I think by the cute kids we had in tow. Even nicer!   A great family outing at Taco Bell! Who knew? I was only expecting quick and cheap, but received much more.

Chaparral is everything you need in a dog park.  Well maintained.  Water available for the dogs. Bags for the owners.  An area for active dogs. An area for passive dogs. A division preferable to big and small dogs in my opinion.  Ample parking.  Well lit.  Frequented by a generally thoughtful group of dog owners.

A patient and helpful waiter, combined with outstanding food and a perfect semi-sophisticated (but not too sophisticated) vibe, easily results in a strong five star rating.  The menu is more than a bit complicated. I believe there were actually six of them this Friday evening. That's half the fun and where a helpful waiter comes into play. Since a majority of our party had never been to the restaurant, we opted to share numerous small items to sample the menu. Many were ordered on the recommendation of our waiter. We were not disappointed. Interestingly, the bistro green beans tapas was my favorite dish (I was traumatized early in life by too many middle school cafeteria green beans, so green beans are never preference of mine). Or were the pork belly buns my favorite? Or the shrimp tempura udon? Can't decide.   Highest praise came from my daughter, the one who lived in NYC for a year. She stated, "this reminds me of my favorite NYC sushi spot."   I greatly appreciated the helpful waiter who showed no impatience with our illogical ordering process or our preference for water (there goes the big tip in many waiter's eyes) as our beverage. We tipped him as though we had all ordered cocktails.  The location, wedged between a Subway and a Circle K, doesn't impress. But open the restaurant door and you'll be rewarded. Reservations suggested if you are going at a peak time.

It's a post office, so it's difficult to get too excited. This location, however, has something great going for it. It is the central post office for all of Phoenix, with a mail processing center situated next door. Take your package here and there's a chance you can shave a day off the time needed to deliver that package to the Midwest. Same possibility for First Class mail.  They have more experienced and friendly staffers here than at your average USPS location. The lines are usually short, although the likelihood of getting behind someone with an unique international mailing or a package in need of repacking seems greater here for some reason. On this day I experienced both, adding significantly to my wait even though I was third in line when I arrived.   Like most people, I don't go to the post office much any more, instead opting for package pickup and/or private delivery alternatives. And don't even mention letters. Visiting here is a little like traveling back in time.

I like Steele Indian School Dog Park, particularly when viewed within the larger context of the Steele Indian School Park. It's a great place to take your dogs for a walk around the park and then let them loose for a run in the fenced area. The dog park has all the essentials: Fence. Bags. Water. Shade. Picnic benches. Some grass.  A suggestion about parking. You can park in any of the Steele parking lots and walk to the north and east to find the dog facility. If you're not in a mood for walking, the only entrance to the dog park parking lot is found off of Seventh Street (just north of the VA Hospital). I didn't even know there was a Seventh Street entrance to Steele until I searched for it.  There are separate areas for small dogs and large dogs. While admittedly not based on a large number of visits, the small dog area seems a lot busier. Perhaps an urban park frequented mainly by small urban apartment dogs or just my bad luck. Don't know. Still, the large dog area is busy enough weekdays after 5:00 and on weekends.  The Friends of Hance Dog Park, another a City of Phoenix facility, is located nearby if you are looking for alternatives.

It's been a year or so since I've been to Butterfield's. Hard to explain, but it's never been a true favorite of mine. Always seemed noisy. Service seemed average. Perhaps it's just that I remember the Coco's that occupied the building prior to them. Not a favorite of mine either. Whatever the case, my expectations on this day weren't particularly high.  I'm pleased to say that we had a great time at Butterfield's. We were seated more quickly than promised, despite being a party of six on a Sunday morning. Coffee was served promptly and refills were offered frequently.   We decide to order four adult entrees and just share with the two little ones in our party. No problem. Two extra plates were delivered to our table in advance of our meals without us having to ask. We also all opted to have specialty pancakes with our omelets/eggs/bacon. Just a 99 cent add on. We had bananas, berries and pecans aplenty. They were a delight to share. The only mild disappointment in any our meals were the breakfast potatoes; crisp and well cooked, but bland.  Sure, Butterfield's is still a bit noisy, but the variety of pancakes is great fun and the egg dishes are solid. Also feels a lot less crowded than its Scottsdale sister Butters. I definitely won't wait another year before I return again.

Wow. Now I remember why I never cared much for Butterfield's. We had a good experience about a month ago, motivating us to return. Today, our experience could best be described as stressful.  We checked in early on a Sunday, largely beating the rush. As a party of six, however, we still had a 25 minute wait. Not bad. A half hour came and went, so we checked to see how much longer it would be. They indicated we had already been seated. Quite a surprise to us as you can imagine.   We were promised we would be next. Another 25 minutes came and went. Another large party was seated. Then, finally, us. Without apology.   Service was adequate. The specialty pancakes were fine, but two omelets we ordered were quite disappointing.   A simple genuine apology for the seating screw up would have gone a long way. Or at least then serve us something exceptional.  Treating customers so poorly, whether a result of complacency or arrogance, is how seemingly invincible restaurants like Butterfield's find a path to failure.

Lakeshore provides a wide variety of educational materials for preschool and elementary school children. The store is frequented by teachers, parents and the occasional grandparent. Caution. Lakeshore can be a bit pricey. There is always a coupon available, however, if you sign up for their weekly notices. On this day they were kind enough to allow us to use our smart phone coupon twice (buy one, get 50% off a second item) by dividing our four items into two transactions. Thoughtful. There are also clearance and sale items. In other words, you can reduce the cost from insanely expensive to just expensive if you pay attention. With so many unique items, expensive can seem pretty reasonable.

Try the Taco Bell in the truck stop next door. This McDonald's is that bad! I must confess I actually like breakfast at McDonald's on occasion. Never again here. Service at one speed: SLOW. Defeats the whole reason for this McDonald's existence: stopping in for a quick bite on your way to San Diego or to Phoenix. And today, after a 20 plus minute wait after ordering, the food was cold!!!

Well, that's an hour an a half of my life forever lost. At least I have overpriced internet access once again. It's fascinating to watch this company, in an industry destined to die, treating its customers so poorly. Slogans like "your friend in the internet age" and calling themselves a "solutions store" don't create customer loyalty. Timely customer service and transparent pricing would. Especially transparent pricing. Add me to the long list of Cox customers who are waiting for the affordable technological leap that will finally allow all ties to Cox to be severed.

Large store. Been visiting here for years. You might not expect to see musical instruments and gaming at Bookman's, but you'll find a substantial inventory here in addition to the books, cd's, dvd's... you expect. Even some collectibles. Bookman's continues to evolve.  Prices are generally reasonable, but some are a bit high. Trade values aren't quite what they were in the good old days, particularly for books, which is understandable. It's the "new normal" for used book stores everywhere. Matters not. Every visit to Bookman's (all locations) is an adventure if you have the time to savor it. You never know what you're going to find.

This Fry's has all the superficial bells and whistles (size, covered parking, sushi, wine...), but lacks heart and follow through. My spouse actually drives out of her way to the basic Fry's at Thunderbird and 40th Street just to avoid this Fry's clutter and higher priced selections. Nearby (smaller) Trader Joes and Albertson's are also preferable in our view. We would also rather support local shops and restaurants for our specialty/gourmet food needs.  So what motivated this review? A cake. A stale cake. A stale birthday cake. A stale birthday cake that was cute, but much more expensive than comparable cakes at Costco or Albertson's or Walmart. Yes, Walmart, the discount purveyor of soft and moist cakes, unlike those sold at Fry's. Thank you Fry's for nearly ruining our party. Thankfully our guests were great. Chill. Of course that's why they were invited. Still, the kindest thing said about the cake was, "It wasn't so bad." But it was. How can this happen? The cake was picked up an hour before the party. Baked fresh, then frozen, then thawed, then frozen... I suppose. Stand alone, the bakery deserves a negative star rating. No more Fry's baked goods for us.   FYI, the birthday party was nearly three weeks ago. I hate Yelp reviews written in anger over a single incident, so I waited a bit to write this one. You should have seen the first draft of this review :) The final draft was written, however, with years of experience at this store and its predecessors in mind. Thus, two stars rather than one.

If you are visiting Arizona or hosting a visitor to Arizona, the Desert Caballeros Western Museum should be on your short list of possible things to do. It is a small museum, but it's not a small town museum. It's professionally curated, with a unique and extensive mix of Western art and Western history on display:  Western art, including paintings and bronzes.  Western tradition, including saddles and firearms.  Western culture, including a general store.  Arizona history generally, including minerals and mining.  Wickenburg history specifically.  If you have kids, be sure to bring them downstairs. Photography is allowed on this level and there may be hands on activities underway depending on the day. Regardless, the general store there ("how we shopped before WalMart") is a hard to comprehend sight for many little ones. Oh yes, don't forget that the museum is housed in two separate buildings.  The museum volunteers are friendly and phenomenally helpful. Admission is relatively inexpensive. There is a headphone tour available if you are so inclined, or you can just wander as we did on this day when we had young kids in tow. The visit can then be completed by dropping in on the assortment of locally owned shops and cafes located nearby, all within easy walking distance.

What a perfect business! Depending on the time of day, this Jack-In-the-Box will be hosting a steady stream of Cocopah Middle Schoolers, or a crowd of Chaparral High School students or a parade of young adults sobering up from a night of partying. And let's not forget Jack's core target demographic, the late night stoner suffering from the munchies.   That's what a diverse snack-oriented menu, a dining room open until midnight and a drive-thru open 24 hours a day, will do for you. And it doesn't hurt that most of the workers here are very friendly.

Picked up my lawnmower today following an encounter with a large metal object buried in a lawn I volunteered to mow. My reward for volunteerism, I suppose. Fortunately, Besco Lawn Mower Repair was able to get me up and running again for the price of a $95 mower tune-up.   The guys were all very friendly. The price turned out to be very reasonable, especially given that I was fearful I had bent the cam shaft. My only issue, no doubt a consequence of this being the busy Spring repair season, was communication. I dropped off the mower on a Saturday and did not hear anything for several days. I finally called them and they indicated it would be a few more days before they could look at it. At that time, I approved the repair as long as it came in at $95 or less. I was anxious, because a bent cam shaft would likely mean the mower was history. It's a simple push mower, but one with a Honda engine that I didn't want to give up.  I eventually received a call that my mower had been repaired and that it was ready to be picked up. The guys at the counter could not fully explain what repairs had been made (not necessary, but I was curious), but could only tell me that a complete tune-up had been performed. A tune-up was needed, but I'm not sure I really needed a new starter rope... Whatever the case, the mower looks like new and should be good to go for quite some time.  I'll definitely use Besco again. Communication was a bit of an issue and the repair took over ten days, but the end result was great. Certainly a lot cheaper than a new mower or than using Sears (where the mower was originally purchased) for repair.  I also appreciated that Besco took the mower in for repair with just my name and phone number. No nonrefundable deposit or credit card number required.

I must state up front that I am a Carolina regular. I've eaten there well over 100 times over the years. So what keeps me coming back? Foremost, the prices are very reasonable.This is not Taco Bell. This is Arizona style border food, but at fast food prices. Try a simple beef taco in any one of the many combination plates to see the superiority. And the fresh flour tortillas are wonderful (hot, large & thin).    So why only three stars (see update below)? The dining room can be a disaster at times. Want a clean table? It's up to you. Get behind a large carryout order, expect a long wait. Order when the kitchen staff is taking a break, expect a long wait. Or get lightening fast service. You never know. The hot sauce is flavorful and actually spicy hot, but it is watery and presented in metal pumps. All three pumps are often empty before staff comes out to refill them. Meanwhile, the pump area can become an unsanitary mess.  Perhaps the best approach to Carolina's is as a carryout restaurant. Or bring an extra friend who can save a table for your group while you order.  Enjoy the food, but pay a little extra elsewhere if you want some atmosphere.  Solid, traditional Mexican border fare, a refreshing change from ubiquitous Mexican grill chain restaurants.  09/23/2014 Update: They've been doing a little better keeping the hot sauce pump area and the tables clean. Still not ideal. And the speed of service is still wildly inconsistent. Bumping the rating up to four stars.

It's a Subway, so no sense reviewing the food. Four stars is probably the top rating possible for this chain. That said:  The location is great. Right next to the 51. I like to go to nearby Country Boys, my favorite "super cheap breakfast" spot, and then buy a Subway sandwich for later in the day. Then hop right on the freeway.  The dining room is larger than most Subways. You can stay and eat here comfortably without being bothered by others waiting for their food. Clean and well kept.  Staff is friendly and efficient, at least I have never had any issues in my few visits.

I'm a long time customer of Danny's, so it's with a bit of a heavy heart that I write this review. Danny's financial problems are well documented. Further, legal prosecution of managers who knowingly utilized undocumented workers was national news. Have these issues had an impact at the customer level? Sadly, the answer seems to be yes.  On this particular weekend morning I was delighted to slip to the front of the vacuuming line without waiting. First in line on a weekend! Never happens! I'll be in and out in no time, or at least that was the thought. I opted for the usual, The Works, and wandered into the waiting room. A room that use to be full of merchandise, but that now is pretty much empty. Paid, receiving the usual discount, then waited. And waited. And waited. Over half an hour despite no one in front of me in line.   When my car was finally delivered, I had to ask for some additional wiping for spots missed. Then I drove away. With my wipers on, my turn signals flashing, the radio station changed, three AC vents closed - just about every car washing pet peeve possible. I could not help but think of all the hard working undocumented guys who no longer work there. The ones who did great work for little pay, thankful for the opportunity. Such a shame.  Allow for a little extra time if you do go to Danny's to get your car washed. Also pay attention to discounts. A sign summarizing them is posted behind the counter. A three dollar discount for students and teachers, any time, is particularly nice.

Fantastic little neighborhood Thai restaurant. We're all about the Pumpkin Curry, but Sala Thai has a lot more than one dish to offer.   The atmosphere. It's intimate, with pretty much every square inch of wall space filled with kitschy artwork and memorabilia.  The napkins. Neatly folded in birdlike form with a fork inserted.  The presentation. Food is served in a manner consistent with a much more expensive restaurant.  The menu. Pumpkin Curry! What more need be said?  In all seriousness. I love the food. There is plenty of variety on the menu. Those in search of heat will find it. Those not can find safe refuge. Servers routinely ask for your heat preference on a scale of one to five, with five being hottest. Keep in mind it's an Asian scale. I'd suggest you go no higher than a three, my preference, even it you like your food spicy. Go higher at your own risk.  They will ask you to pay in cash if possible. We paid with a credit card on our most recent visit, without problem or comment. It's just a small business understandably trying to avoid high credit card fees. I'm fine with that if it helps keep their prices reasonable.

They do great work here. The heavy lifting. Dealing with an unbelievable volume of neglected pets.   They may not have much variety in pets for adoption at the Sunnyslope site, at least not in comparison to their Campus for Compassion in south Phoenix, but you can easily drop in or check online. Just be patient. Unfortunately, there is no end to the steady stream of pets in need of a home. The Campus for Compassion is sooooo far away for North Phoenix and Scottsdale residents. It's nice to have Sunnyslope.  Much of the focus at Sunnyslope is on the vital pet fostering program. Much of it very short-term, including care of pets for active military stationed overseas... The medical facility at this location is also extensive.  Also a pet thrift store operated for the benefit of the Arizona Humane Society on site.

I don't hunt. Seldom fish. Don't boat. Haven't camped in years. Why on earth is this guy at Bass Pro Shops? It's a fantastic store for kids, especially around the holidays.  On this day, a week before Halloween, we had a free photo with the Peanuts gang, held on tight for a merry-go-round ride, did some quality Crayola coloring work, completed a free foam pumpkin refrigerator magnet craft, looked at giant fish in an aquarium, rode two elevators, crossed bridges over a stream full of fish, tried out a tent, imagined the wind in our hair on some all terrain vehicles, sampled some pumpkin bread, and bought... oops, we forgot to buy anything.  Thanks Bass Pro Shops. We promise to remember to buy something when we come back for Christmas!

Fairytale Brownies is a local Arizona company that makes brownies that are a perfect treat to send or serve to friends and relatives who live elsewhere. Or to just enjoy yourself. While it might be easier to just order your brownies online, there's something to be said for wandering down to the factory to fulfill your cravings.  Don't expect warm brownies fresh out of the oven if you visit. They're the same brownies you would receive if you ordered online, served from a refrigerated case. Not a problem. They are packaged and sealed individually to maintain freshness. Do, however, expect samples for your trouble. Yum.  No big discounts for going to the source either. Prices are comparable to those posted online. The staff is helpful, however, and will let you know if promotions are available. Just ask. It's also nice to see the different brownie sizes and packaging in person.   There is a window from which to view the "bakery". I've visited several times and have yet to see very much going on, but it can be fun for young kids. A little planning can increase your chances of seeing some activity. The glass is a bit hazy to look through because it's fireproof.   Did I mention the samples? Oh yes. There's also a Yelp deal for a free brownie at check in.

I'm not a guy who's loyal to parking spots. When visiting the airport, I start with the possibility of a free ride and work my way through other options from there depending on time, promotions, people involved... So it comes as a bit of a surprise to me I'm motivate enough to write a review for the Parking Spot,  Why did I park here this time? No free ride available. Not away for a long tine, so just as cheap as taking Super Shuttle... And a discount card. Hardly a ringing endorsement. Checked in to a nice covered spot around 10 p.m. and was picked up immediately by their shuttle. So far so good.  Fast forward four hours. My flight was delayed, then cancelled. I called for a 2 a.m. Shuttle to come to terminal four and was returned promptly to my car. The driver radioed ahead and told the cashier that my flight was cancelled. At checkout? NO CHARGE and a free bottle of water. I actually felt guilty when I returned to the airport in a free ride later in the day, but the Parking Spot has definitely gained a loyal fan for the future.

As all Harkins theatergoers know, it's all about the Loyalty Cup! I do like the North Valley location, the only Harkins for which I have written a review. It seems just busy enough to stay open, but not so busy as to be hassle on a big opening weekend. It's not a brand new theatre, but it was built recently enough to have comfortable stadium seating.  Like all Harkins, the staff is young and inconsistent, but generally friendly. Concessions are expensive, but with good variety. A $5.25 investment in the Loyalty Cup will provide you with $1.50 drink refills for a full calendar year. A t-shirt deal, involving popcorn, is also available. Personally, however, I've never been willing to make that fashion statement.  Discounts are available at the ticket window for children, students and seniors. Discounted tickets are also sometimes available at Costco.

Established 1951 and showing every year of it. That's a good thing. Lucky Boy Burger Shop is a classic small burger and shake joint. Sure, there are some inconveniences associated with beaming back to 1951. No free drink refills (35-50 cents to refill). A small dining room. No restroom. A small parking lot that can be difficult to exit. Service can be slow. No worries though. It's all worth it.  The burgers are "divine," at least according to a six year old who accompanied me this visit. I assume it was a new vocab word at school, but I tend to agree anyway. All burgers come with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle, unless you request otherwise. You then select one of four options: Lucky Burger (ketchup & mustard), Lucky Original (Tangy Ranch), Lucky International (1000 Island), Lucky BBQ (BBQ sauce). No bad choices here, even though I suspect there is no one in the kitchen calling themselves an executive chef. Then choose a 1/4 lb, 1/2 lb, 3/4 lb or 1 lb burger. Yes, one pound! I've never seen the one pounder, but I can tell you that the quarter pounder is a generous burger and large enough for most folks.   The French fries are wonderful. Not the skinny fast food variety nor the half a seasoned potato thick cut. Classic. Perfectly prepared every time. The onion rings are the uniform chopped onion type, not the kind from which strings of fresh onion emerge as you try to eat them, but they are tasty enough and do the trick. The kids actually prefer them to stringy alternative. The kids have also enjoyed the grilled cheese sandwiches and the corn dogs. They are fans of both the onion rings and the French fries and, of course, sitting on the bar stools in the dining room. Just make sure your little ones bathroom before visiting, since there are no facilities on the premises. Did I mention the shakes and malts? The kids love those too. How could they not with a dozen or so flavors to choose from (cinnamon, peanut butter, banana, butterscotch...)?   Closed Sundays.

It's been a long time since I've been to Z'Tejas. Use to go there quite often when it was a new concept, but fickle I am. I'm delighted to say we had a great meal there tonight.  I had forgotten how much I liked the oven fresh cornbread that leads off the meal. I ordered the smothered chicken burrito. It carried some serious heat, which I loved, but I suspect it was more than the kitchen intended. Others in my party opted to share three happy hour appetizer specials. They enjoyed all three.  Our table was located within earshot of the bar. Tuesday?!? night and happy hour was in full swing. Volume increased as the night progressed and drinks multiplied, gradually making conversation at our table a bit challenging. Didn't ruin the meal, but surely didn't add to it either. Obviously, they still have a great happy hour at Z'Tejas. I'd recommend a table well away from that area. Or perhaps just join in the drinking.

I really like Sweet Republic. Some observations follow that might help your first experience here be a good one.   Yes, Sweet Republic has received all sorts of national and local recognition. One of the best ice cream shops around. Don't, however, let your expectations be warped unreasonably. It's a fun little shop that serves unique hand crafted ice cream. Nothing more. Go with that expectation and you'll love Sweet Republic.  Some flavors are truly unique. Take a taste or two before you commit to a flavor. As much as I love Sweet Republic, I've encountered some flavors that were not at all what I expected. I suspect it's the natural ingredients...   Flavors offered do change. Just be patient. Your favorites will come back around with the seasons, the day of the week or at the whim of the proprietor (who might be in the house). There are a few staples, however, you can rely on being available.  Consider spending a little extra and opt for a sundae. These concoctions really differentiate Sweet Republic. Warning. They're addictive.  No way around it. Sweet Republic is a bit expensive. You're paying for quality ingredients and unique flavors. Not a bad tradeoff.

I have a sentimental spot in my heart for Waffle House. Reminds me of my college days. I always like to ask the servers if any rock stars or athletes have been arrested at their location. And who doesn't love their pecan waffles? This location, with an uncharacteristically upscale brick façade, looks promising from the exterior. Plus, it's right off the 101. Once inside, it's a very typical Waffle House, which is actually a good thing if you're like me and willing to embrace the entire Waffle House experience. Seating is cramped and there can be issues if you have more than four people in your party (typical Waffle House). There is also a less than welcoming sign restricting the use of booths to parties of two or more (also typical of Waffle House). But to quote another reviewer, "This is the place to go if you want to be ignored" (not typical of Waffle House).  Actually, it's not quite as simple as just being ignored. I recently visited this location twice in quick succession. One visit, at an off peak evening time, was pleasant. Didn't feel crowded or rushed. Service was friendly and reasonably attentive. Only downside? The young server had no knowledge of celebrity arrests. Oh well. The second visit, during a peak weekday morning time, was thoroughly unpleasant. Flying insects!!! Dirty counters and tables. Begging required for coffee refills?!? Had to wait for the check. Then felt pushed out the door. Greeted by police arresting someone (not a celebrity) in the small parking lot. Hmm.  The food is fine. Solid Waffle House. The service? Very inconsistent. Folks next to me at the counter during the morning visit were offered whip cream, coffee refills... but I had my food shoved at me and never saw my waitress again. Perhaps that can be forgiven. We all have busy times or bad days. Flying insects? Sticky tables? Being pushed out the door? A broken booth in serious need of repair, apparently for quite some time if the sign posted is an indication? Those issues, especially those involving cleanliness, are not specific to one person and cannot be so easily dismissed. I would never return here in the morning, but I might stop by again at an off peak time when they've had time to clean the restaurant and swat flies before I arrive. Waffle House is always more fun at night in my experience and they serve the pecan waffles any time.

Don't let the name, Costco Business Center, scare you away.  Embrace the bulk! There are many items sold here that you will not find at a traditional Costco.  Items here are sold on the assumption that you are a restaurant or small business that will reselling whatever you buy or at least using it as part of your business. That makes for some unusual and sometimes entertaining selections.  So what was I, not the owner of a small business, doing here on a Saturday afternoon? Helping a pre-school teacher buy mass quantities of plastic squeeze bottles. Roughly two bucks a six pack. Sweet! Speaking of sweet, we also picked up some pizza shaped gummies and some blue shark gummies for snacks, as well as 500 coffee filters for crafts. Yes, 500. Some of the quantities sold here are insane, but some of the items are great for teachers anyway.  We've also purchased drinks and snacks for youth sport teams here in the past. They have more variety of both than a normal Costco. A great choice!  Some cautionary comments: Hours are limited. For example, they close at 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and are not open at all on Sunday. Further, many items you might expect to find at Costco are not sold here. Finally, browsing for some items can be a challenge.  There are a lot of large brown cardboard boxes filled with items like plastic forks, paper plates, cups, blue shark gummies (yes!), Styrofoam containers... they're assuming you're a business person who knows what you need and they don't even pretend to sway you with packaging for many items.  Stop by when you  have a few extra minutes to browse. The Ranch market that shares the parking lot is also not your normal grocer.

Nice little shop. Neatly arranged. A lounge. Andrew, the manager, is extremely helpful. I dropped by to sell some old pipes. I had done some research and knew only one pipe had much value, but I had hopes that the rest could find new life in the right hands. I had to leave them at the shop for the owner to examine when he next came in. A reasonably fair price was offered by phone the next day. I never did get to speak to the owner directly, which I would have liked. When I arrived to collect payment and to retrieve the one pipe not sold, my "cash" offer was delivered in the form of a check. Not the cash promised and an inconvenience for me. Very fair treatment though overall. I also noticed they have a loyal regular clientele, many with whom they interact on a first name basis. Almost makes me want to start smoking. Or not.

We found this moving company through Yelp. Two hundred reviews and an average rating of five stars. Too good to be true?   A team of two friendly guys showed up at my daughter's apartment on time, within the promised window and after a phone call to update their ETA. We were the second move of the day for this team. Had to be brutal for them. Moving out of one third floor apartment (no elevator) into another third floor apartment (no elevator). There was no whining. Just some good humor. After a quick discussion about what needed to be done, they went right to work. Quickly. No breaks. Important since they were being paid by the hour. They only took a 15 minute fast food break in transit between apartments, for which they made a time adjustment in the final billing.   The final bill fell right into the range expected. Billing was done electronically on an tablet. Credit cards are accepted and an itemized billing is emailed to you on the spot. There were a couple of very minor dings to our furniture, but the overall performance was amazing given the hazardous nature of the stairs they were negotiating and the volume of items. We tipped them well.  We would definitely use Just-In Time again.

We had a very nice experience buying a car at Chapman Mazda. A test drive with no pressure. Stopped in again to view the car - no pressure. Asked for a phone quote as we narrowed our decision. Received quote in five minutes. And unlike the funny business of some auto dealers whose internet quotes were entirely misleading, the Chapman out the door quote later proved to be accurate to the nearest dollar. Treated very professionally by salesman Shawn, an Army veteran who did tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan (a fact we found out only after we has committed and were waiting to sign).  Only stuck with a couple of minor high margin dealer add ons we didn't really want, a $400 window tint and a $200 security etching, but well below the abusive levels of some other auto dealers. Simply said we didn't want the car alarm and paint protection. No squabbling and no "it's already on the car" arguments. A Mazda corporation extended warranty was also offered on signing, to which you can say yes or no, but at least it's a better option than conflicted dealer specific programs or non auto manufacturer programs sometimes offered elsewhere.  We can't comment on the merits of the service department. Noted the number of Yelpers upset by discontinuation of a "lifetime" $9.99 oil change when management changed. I'd be upset too. Hoping for the best.  We typically like to use buying programs or internet contacts to avoid the hassle of haggling. We undermined ourselves this time by indecision which brand/model to purchase, exposing us to some pretty abusive sales practices. While still an auto dealer, the culture at Chapman is not nearly as corrupt as we saw elsewhere.

I love Café Ga Hyang.   I'll admit I'm not extremely well versed in Korean cuisine. I'm just a bit beyond the pointing at the menu "I'll have that" stage. I do, however, have a Korean food advocate in the family. After spending a time in NYC with two Korean roommates, this family member returned to Arizona with a taste for Korean soap operas and Korean food. She was greatly relieved to find Café Ga Hyang and considers it one of two favorite local Korean spots. I, however, can recognize an outstanding family run restaurant, regardless of ethnicity, when I see one. The location in an aging strip center does not leave a strong initial impression. Do not be deterred. The Korean television, the décor, the private booths, the big long tables, the late hours (open daily until 2:00 a.m.)... and of course the food, will leave a positive lasting impression by the time you depart..   The entire restaurant is served by one waitress, which I'm sure slows things down at peak times, but seems to be a way to keep the family in charge of interacting with diners. A great idea if that's the thought process. Our server showed visible concern when we ate very little of one of the dishes we ordered, a genuine reaction you seldom see while dining. No problem with the food. We just ordered too much and expended too much effort on the glorious array of small side dishes. She then packed it up for us to go. We dined in one of the enclosed booths. Fun and very private. We felt like we had the restaurant to ourselves. Simply great service. We also appreciated when a little instruction was volunteered, without the slightest hint of condescension, regarding how to best eat (and enjoy) one of the dishes.  I will definitely volunteer to return whenever the family needs another fix of Korean cuisine.

It's been a while since I've physically entered the MDV. I can feel productivity in the entire state of Arizona slipping away as I sit here. Thank goodness for the ServiceArizona web site!   You enter the building and wait in a line to get a number so you can sit and wait for your number to appear on a screen. Once served, you will likely have to wait again, depending upon what you are trying to accomplish. You know this is going to happen. This system hasn't changed in years. What is hard to understand is the gruff, "where else are you going to go?" attitude of so many of the employees. I'm sure the job is a grind, with the same stupid questions asked day after day, but a few of the workers do find a way to be civil. Even friendly. It's possible. Not the first nor second nor the fourth person that helped me were the least bit courteous. The third person was amazingly helpful and efficient, but I even had to wait for her to return from an apparent break before finally being helped. Curious what I was doing that took nearly two hours and required the help of four people? Simply updating the photo on my drivers license! Soooooo incredibly inefficient.  And Yelpers, do not try to take a photo inside the building! I witnessed a reprimand. Hadn't seen anything quite like it since I was in high school! Hilarious! And don't even think about bringing in a pet!  Forced to make a positive observation, I would note that this location in North Scottsdale is in a safe area and has service as good, or bad, as any.

A very fun store. Lots of unique treats, toys and accessories for your furry friends. And fun Arizona Humane Society t-shirts... for the not so furry. This is not a thrift store. It is very much a pet boutique with all new merchandise.  Significantly, there is a pet adoption center at the back of the store. Several dogs and a large number of cats were available for adoption on this day. You can stop in and see the pets in person or browse adoptable pets on the Humane Society web site before visiting.  And remember, every dollar you spend here is going to support the admirable work of the Arizona Humane Society. Prices are similar to PetSmart. Why not make purchases for your pet here and support a non profit organization?  Important note: The store closes every day at 6:00 p.m.

What distinguishes this El Pollo Loco from most others is its spacious dining room. The staff here also does a nice job of maintaining the salsa bar, an area in which some locations fall short.   Located on the back side of Arizona Mills shopping mall, near some other restaurants that have closed, the location offers a quiet break from the chaos of the mall. It's also easily accessible if you are passing by and not visiting the mall itself.

A middle of the night visit to Scottsdale Shea's ER with one of my kids prompted me to write this review. All went well. Checked in at 2:00 a.m. Out by 5:00. Cared for by a great team of professionals.  The experience prompted memories of family visits for a broken wrist, a bad ankle, an appendix about to burst, a Thanksgiving day slit wrist (unintentional), abdominal pain, infection... I'd like to complain about all of these visits, but care was exceptional in all cases.   While this review relates specifically to the ER, over the years our family has also had outpatient surgery at the Piper Center, abdominal surgery in the main hospital, an extended stay by an elderly family member... even a birth. Great location. Great doctors. Great nurses. Great staff.

Very cute little sandwich shop conveniently located right next door to the Desert Caballeros Western Museum. Only a little consistent with the Old West vibe of the area if that's what you're after. There are other cafes just down the street where you can find more of that. Nana's has a fun and relaxing décor that could easily be located in Scottsdale. This day we ordered two sandwiches, a salad and the quiche. All were solid, but only the quiche received truly rave reviews. Incidentally, it may enhance your experience if you have an actual Nana accompanying you as we did. No kids menu items, however, for the grandchildren. We will return.

A fantastic not for profit organization operated for the benefit of teachers. It's no secret that teachers often pay for teaching supplies out of their own pocket. Treasures 4 Teachers accepts donations and resells the items to teachers at remarkably low prices.  Be aware that shopping here requires proof of employment as a teacher and payment of a $35 annual membership fee. They give tours to those considering membership, so you're not forced to commit before knowing if they sell what you need. Trust me. Once you see the inventory and prices, you'll sign up.  They are a bit strict about only letting members go into the shopping area. They actually have a waiting room of sorts for non members.   The store includes a "fill-a-bag for $5" area, a free area, an individually priced area... Lots of books, games, office supplies, teaching resources... Just keep in mind there's a randomness to the inventory linked to what is donated. The store is remarkably well organized given that fact. I'd suggest all teachers drop in for a tour and see for themselves. Not a teacher? Stop in for a tour as well. See what types of donations they'll accept from you.

Camden, like many large apartment firms, uses a computer algorithm to assist in setting rents. I mention this because rent for similar Camden Copper Square apartments can vary by a couple of hundred dollars month to month, dependent on nearby vacancies... So, if you price Camden and it seems a bit expensive, check back in a few days or weeks or months, particularly if you are searching at peak seasonal moving times. This can impact you when your lease comes up for renewal as well. It's a bit of a gamble, but being patient and watching rates can often save you a significant amount. Also be aware there are some fees (garbage), which are really just an indirect way of charging you higher rent. They need to be considered when you are budgeting.   I was about to assign Camden Copper Square a three star rating and my daughter, a resident (two years) at Camden until just recently, insisted that I bump it up to four stars. "I really liked the layout of my apartment and the staff there was quick to make repairs... And there were no unexpected charges when I moved out." I'd also note it's very conveniently located near Chase Field, the Arizona Science Center, the U of A Medical School, ASU nursing... The parking garage is safe and convenient, the swimming pools and exercise facilities are resort-like and there is a nice little dog park.  Concerns? It's not a great neighborhood to the East and even a walk to the West often involves stepping around homeless souls at the bus stop. In addition, if you're a young professional or a graduate student, the influx of ASU undergraduate students is a bit of an issue (avoid apartments near the main pool). The growth of ASU downtown has changed the character of many downtown apartment complexes as students, often motivated by the "dry" policy at official ASU campus housing, move off campus. But there are clusters of young professionals, medical students... at Camden Copper Square, which is worth inquiring about if you are concerned about noise. Much of the northwest corner of the complex, around the small pool, is one such area as of this writing.  One more practical suggestion. Since there are no elevators, consider renting a truck from Home Depot if you are moving yourself. Unlike a UHaul, these trucks have low enough clearance to fit into the multi-level parking garage.

Usually don't want to admit to stopping at a McDonald's, especially since one of my profile photos celebrates a McDonald's being torn down, but here I was, stranded while my car was being repaired nearby. I was treated nicely and was allowed to use their free wifi for a couple of hours.  The positives: Very nicely updated interior, with a couple of large communal seating options for groups. Television. Free wifi.   The negatives: No directly accessible drink refills!!!!!! (You must wait for refills at the counter). The kids play place is very modest and useful for only very young children. No video games. The AC system left the restaurant freezing and drafty on this day.  I think this would have been a three star review if you didn't have to beg for drink refills like it was the 1980's. Perhaps even a four star review if they had a more elaborate play place. But alas, no such luck.

A wonderful little park with a big novelty attraction, a huge geyser of a fountain. It shoots off on the hour, every hour, when the sun is out.  The park has other things going for it. Play areas for the kids, including a splash pad for use in the warm months. Great grassy areas in which to run around. Nice walkways for strolling or power walking. Benches for resting... Ducks aplenty,  We usually visit here when there is a special event in the area. Even if there is no organized event going on, there are many shops and eating spots nearby.  Drive on up from Phoenix. The elevation in Fountain Hills is a little higher and perhaps you can convince yourself that it is cooler on a hot summer day.  And don't forget to look for the fountain from above if you are flying into Sky Harbor Airport from  the northeast.

Love this little spot. Love the prices. Love the food.   I am guilty on occasion of being a bit of a cheapskate, so I'm tempted to just emphasize the low cost of dining at Noodle and Rice. That would be an injustice, however, since the food is great and equivalent to a much more expensive restaurant. I guess there's a lot to be said for low overhead, the benefit of an odd location facing a Quik Trip convenience store.  N & R is cozy. Not small. That would imply it's a problem. Cozy. There are just eight tables, each seating four, and a couple of stools. That's it. The décor is fun. And the restaurant seems to do a thriving carryout and delivery business. Our recent visit was kind of late, just an hour before their 9:00 p.m. closing time. No problem getting a table, but it can be an issue at other times.  We love the Thai Iced Tea. The 99 cent chicken eggs rolls with sweet and sour sauce are tasty. We ordered and shared both Thai and Chinese offerings. I'm sure this is a violation of foodie purist code, but it works well for our taste buds. The Panang Curry is especially delicious. Despite the low prices, N & R is generous with the chicken in the dishes we ordered. And the menu is surprisingly diverse for such a tiny establishment.  The kids meals are amazingly affordable, just $2.95 including drink.    Yes, I know I ended up emphasizing the restaurant's low prices, which I promised I wouldn't do. Oh well.   If you are across the street at Carolina's and the crowd there is a hassle, try wandering over to Noodle & Rice. Whether you are a fan of Thai or Chinese food, you won't be disappointed.

A very nice Presbyterian church located in the heart of Scottsdale. Sure, John Calvin had a few odd ideas, but in this Presbyterian congregation you'll see evidence of his best. You'll find a friendly and accomplished member base, strong leadership and great facilities.

A plumber with over fifty Yelp reviews and a four and a half star rating? Definitely sounds too good to be true. But it's not. Ron really is a quality guy. I called him late in the day. He handled the scheduling himself! He was booked for the rest of the day, but after confirming it wasn't an emergency, he squeezed in an appointment the next day between 11:00 and 1:00. Not too big of a window. I can live with that. He gave an estimate over the phone, suggesting he may not be able to handle this type of clog for the $59 special price. Rather, it could be as much as $120. Full disclosure. Nice!  He called the next day in advance of arrival. Early! Arrived and rapidly addressed the clog and charged us - wait for it - $59. He could have easily charged me $120 and I would have been none the wiser. We recently had a horrible experience with George Brazil and their $99 clog special. They arrived and gave us an estimate of nearly $400 for a clog more routine than this one. Ron is no George Brazil. Thank goodness!  Ron specializes mainly in clogs, but he is will to do a few other things like installing faucets. On this day, I offered him another quick job at our other house nearby. He turned down the work because he did not want to inconvenience his other customers who were waiting. I was disappointed, but it made me like him even more.

We are here because the north Phoenix Hubbard facility is temporarily closed for renovations. What a nice location! Plenty of dressing rooms. Great waiting area for the parents. Colorful and inviting indoor pool area for the kids. Friendly instructors. Helpful counter staff. Everything is new and clean.  Some other reviews have mentioned that Hubbard is a bit pricey for a 30 minute lesson once a week. True enough. They would like you to start your child as a baby and continue weekly lessons for years, a big commitment. You can easily opt for less. Plus, don't worry if it seems your swimmers are not making much progress early on. There's a method to the way they build confidence. Our two swimmers started late in life, if you can call kindergarten late in life, and are progressing nicely.   Signing up for lessons from just time to time seems to work fine, especially if your primarily goal is simply water safety.

No waiting, convenient mall location, covered parking available, first run movies, relatively inexpensive tickets, decent concessions and comfortable seating, all you need in a movie theater. The Picture Show at Paradise Valley Mall, at one time a Harkins theater location, seems largely forgotten as many movie goers focus only on show times at the larger chains. It's a perfect theater to go see a blockbuster without having to fight the crowds.

Encountered Carte Blanche at an event at the UA School of Medicine in downtown Phoenix. They served a great chicken taco with buttered apples, pecans and blue cheese. Also a simple cheese quesadilla.   I was most impressed by the servers. Really friendly and accommodating. No problem when I asked that a couple of the tacos be just plain chicken for dietary reasons. Not insulted. No problem. And very generous with the chicken. Also interacted well with the kids in our party.  I'm looking forward to encountering Carte Blanche again. Five stars may eventually be in order.

I'm a fan. I love the concept of a menu that changes with the seasons. I love the concept of every item on the menu having 475 calories or less. My only complaint, one typical of other men I've talked to about the restaurant, is that the small portions often leave me hungry. My wife, like most women I've talked to about Seasons 52, begs to differ. She tells me the portions are perfect, especially for an aging male. Ouch! Unfortunately, I think she's right.   I've been mainly a lunchtime visitor. Generally, the food is flavorful, the presentation thoughtful, and the service prompt, which is as much as you can hope for in a chain restaurant. I'm also a big fan of the mini desserts. Conveniently, Seasons 52 also has specific menus available upon request for vegans, vegetarians, lactose sensitive, gluten sensitive and those needing low sodium.

Imagine a PetSmart without any of its cheaper merchandise. That's Choice Pet Market. That said, while the prices are absolutely higher than PetSmart and the like, CPM does have some things to offer. There are some unique items. The store is quite small, so expect to be greeted and helped right away. Buying that 28 pound bag of dog food? They'll carry it out to your car.   In the past, I think I've only used CPM for pet photos with Santa. It wasn't my idea, I swear. Well, maybe it was. Or visited only when other pet supply options had been exhausted. On this day I was in search of vegetarian dog kibble. Don't ask. A visit to PetSmart was unproductive. I'm sure they had some, but I couldn't find it and they were understaffed. I wandered across the street to Choice Pet Market and was helped immediately. Used a 10% off coupon to reduce the cost from obscene to just high, and was on my way in less than ten minutes. Nice.  Understand that CPM's are small stores featuring higher end products. The prices have to be higher and the service has to be better for the business model to work. On this visit, the model worked well.

I've never volunteered here. I've not yet adopted a pet from here. But I have witnessed Home Fur Good adoption events at PetSmart and I have visited their no kill animal rescue center at 10220 N. 32nd Street. HFG has very successfully repurposed what was at one time a very busy preschool. Very nice, very well intentioned, people.  Recently visited HFG twice, considering the adoption of a stray dog they had taken in. They were amazingly patient with us as we introduced the dog to extended family and considered allergy issues. Unfortunately, this particular dog had to find a forever home elsewhere, but we will continue to keep HFG in mind as we continue our search.  They also hold vaccination and microchip clinics and operate a small pet gift shop to support their non profit.

Not a typical public park. No playground. No grills. But that's fine. That's not the park's purpose. It is a fantastic community gathering place in the heart of downtown Chandler. SanTan Brewing and many other businesses are conveniently located nearby as well.   We attend the Indian Art Market held here every October. It's a small event. A wide variety of Native American arts and crafts are available to purchase. Fry bread. Indian tacos. Entertainment. And the Miss Indian AZ contestants are always in attendance. The Dr. AJ Chandler Park is all about special events and it is perfectly suited for the Art Market.

Tempe Kia does business the old fashioned way. Bait you in the door and bring in the sales manager to close the negotiation on a car you don't want. Very disappointing given that we came to Tempe Kia in response to discounted prices posted on the internet.  We had a 9:00 a.m.appointment. We arrived to a showroom void of people and finally met with our salesman nearly half an hour late. We were there to see a specific car that had been "placed out front for my family to view."  Surprise, surprise. Our original internet sales rep was a last minute no show for the appointment and the car we came to see had been transferred to another dealer or (insert story here).  Still, they offered to get us a similar car from another dealership. They also wanted us to pay the $300 plus fee to transfer the car and gave us numerous reasons why the online prices for similar cars would not apply to us. After hours there (not an exaggeration), looking for cars and haggling with the sales manager, we left. We did return to look at the car they had transferred, but another $1,000 surprise in price caused us to walk. Over half a day gone.   Also be aware the posted internet prices do not include a mandatory $599 window tint, although that was the least of our worries. I had noted that fine print in advance.  It's too bad. We came to Tempe Kia fully expecting to quickly drive away in a car at the price they promised. The salesman was very knowledgeable and nice. The management? Not so much. Perhaps we were just falling for a good cop, bad cop routine. Whatever the case, the experience was exactly the waste of time we were trying to avoid by going online and calling ahead by telephone to confirm.

The positive things you've read about Butters' food on Yelp are all true. The pancakes are great! Light and fluffy. My favorite in the Valley, except perhaps for the unique lemon enhanced cakes at The Original Breakfast House. Omelets? "This is the best omelet I've had in ages," was the comment about the Mexicana Omelet during our most recent visit. The Garden Skillet? Solid. Mickey Mouse kids meal? Perfect. Even simple scrambled eggs are uniquely well prepared. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and the coffee is enjoyable black.  The "children's brunch" menu is basic; in other words, just what kids want. Reasonably priced. One cautionary comment: There are no special sizes or prices for kid drinks. You can accidentally double the price of your child's meal if you aren't paying attention.   So why not five stars? Nothing related to the food. Success, however, can create issues. Don't come here on a Saturday or Sunday morning unless you have some time to kill. They do a good job churning the customers, but given the choice I'd rather not be churned. Or feel so cramped. Our recent Sunday morning wait was shorter than promised, but once seated we had to wait for quite a while before being offered coffee, inexcusable for a breakfast joint. I like my coffee black and Butters' coffee does not disappoint. Others in our party who like to self-doctor their java, however, were not as happy. The only tool available was plain cream. Butters does serve vanilla lattes and the like, which was not pointed out by our waitress when an initial ordering inquiry was made about the availability of flavored creamers. An oversight, given that a vanilla latte would have definitely been preferred.   We were seated indoors and the ventilation in our area was less than adequate. It's hard to enjoy your hot coffee when you are perspiring. Finally, our credit card payment was mixed up with another table. While apologetically corrected, it is the type of thing that happens when a restaurant is operating beyond full capacity.  I love Butters. I just need to avoid Sunday mornings there.

Good ice cream and a pleasing environment combine to make Churn a wonderful destination.   Churn is very small, so its popularity often results in lines out the door. Not always though. Lines were short on this Saturday night visit, although it was still a bit early. It allowed us time to sample, sample, sample. An enjoyable luxury. The friendly staff patiently endured the indecisiveness of our party of five. Of all the flavors we sampled, only coconut received a thumbs down, primarily based on texture. Just one or two scoop cones for all of us. I'm afraid no Fat Elvis sundaes this night. Simple peanut butter was my flavor of choice. Loved it. The five and six year olds were fully occupied by the pin wheels planted into their cones. Any flavor will do if there's a pinwheel to play with, confirming Churn's kid friendly status.  Do not, I repeat, do not, just grab your ice cream and go. Walk to the back of the store and see if there are spots open on the patio. For me, the existence of this area is what pushes Churn into five star territory. Comfortable seating. Nice music. Relaxing lighting. The patio completes the experience.

Oregano's is always a solid place to go for pizza, especially if you like your crust very thin as I do.   It's also great for kids. They're presented with a wad of pizza dough to keep them busy for what can be a pretty long wait for food. If you order the kids pizza, you can get them started eating ahead of the adults. For about $3, the kids can opt for a simple pepperoni, diamond cut, while the adults can select something more flavorful. For dessert a warm panned cookie with ice cream to share for just five bucks.  This location, in a building originally built to be a restaurant, is not as unique as some more creative converted locations, either a plus or a minus depending on your perspective. There is an outdoor patio with a very effective heating system if it's cold outside.   The only problem, really, is that wait times can be long. We arrived at 5:15 p.m. on a Wednesday and still couldn't be seated immediately. That's Oregano's, I guess.

What to add when Yelpers have already faithfully posted 500 reviews? I scanned through the mass of comments about Paradise Valley Burger Company and I have a half dozen observations to share.   First, the counter staff is amazingly helpful and friendly, ready to explain their offerings at the slightest hint of uncertainty. You should have no fear about coming here for the first time.   Second, the burgers are just the right size. Two beef patties, but not a massive weight gainer. Not a walk away hungry burger either. Just right.   Third, all those reviewers who rave about the Brulee burger, the burgers of the week, the French toast fries, the sweet potato tots... Everything they say is true.   Fourth, the pricing is not what you'd call cheap, but it's very reasonable, with a basic PV Burger coming in at $5.25 and more elaborate choices listed at $7 or $8. No sides are included, but I'd rather order just what I want and share anyway.   Fifth, it is a small neighborhood restaurant that just happens to be  a foodie paradise. You would never find it without Yelp's help. The dining room is small, although not quite as tiny as the storefront would indicate. Simple, clean and comfy. Perfect.  Sixth, kids are welcome. Space is sometimes in short supply, but there is still plenty of room for the kids. A $5 kids menu features, among other things, small versions of basic burgers (one patty instead of two) complete with a side of fries. Oddly, the menu says these meals are only for kids age seven and under?!? I assume they don't enforce that age limit.  My suggestion would be that you drop your anti-DDD bias and reward yourself by giving the Paradise Valley Burger Company a try.

We just had a perfect experience with Airpark Collision. Actually our second perfect experience with them in the past couple of years. Very friendly and helpful. Good communication. Great quality of work. Locally owned.  Airpark has preferred status with State Farm, our insurer, helping make for a quick and seamless repair. When dealing with the insurance claims department, I mentioned I wanted to use a collision center I had used before, one located near the Scottsdale Airport, but I was uncertain of its name. They listed a half dozen collision centers before finally mentioning Airpark. Not sure why so many were mentioned, given Airpark is precisely in the location I described, but they finally did identify it.   Since Airpark has preferred status with State Farm, I had the option of stopping in for an estimate or just leaving the car for repair. Nice! Left it on a Tuesday morning, with an indication that they would try to finish it by Friday. Promise kept! The car was ready and waiting, looking better inside and out than it had in quite some time. Very pleased with the quality of the work. This experience was an exact repeat of the positive treatment we had received with a different car a year or so earlier. Two for two!  Airpark also has a good working relationship with Enterprise Rental Car. I do not carry rental car insurance coverage, so this car rental was out of pocket expense for me. The folks at Airpark suggested that I simply ask Enterprise for the Airpark rate and for my insurance company rate. Enterprise would then honor the lower of the two rates without me having to bother with online booking. Worked perfectly. Enterprise picked me up at Airpark, of course, but I was also then able to simply leave the car and keys at Airpark when my car was ready. Very convenient.  Great experience overall. Highly recommended.

Country Boys Restaurant is one of those places I've driven by for years but never bothered to try. The banner advertising a cheap breakfast was never the way to get me in the door. I'm happy to say I finally took the plunge and was nicely rewarded.  The cooking is home style and basic, but done very well. The clientele is nicely mixed, generally a bit older perhaps. The waitresses are friendly and prompt with the coffee. On this day, I felt no pressure to vacate my booth as I did some work, always a huge plus for me. The décor is admittedly a touch stale, with a bit of an 80's vibe, but it's consistent with the food. Basic.  You'll be disappointed if you come in search of whole wheat protein pancakes, egg white omelettes... this is not a spot for trendy alternatives or gourmet selections. But if you like your coffee hot and and your pancakes fluffy, this spot is for you. Menu prices are very reasonable, even without promotions. Don't forget to check the white boards (left and right as you enter) for specials. Look for the $2.99 deals posted on each table if you're really on a budget. They might also give you two for one coupons when you pay at the counter. If you're offended by coupons or by paying too little, you'll just have to look elsewhere.  Another plus: Country Boys Restaurant is open 24 hours a day, a rarity in metro Phoenix. One of four locations.

Simply Great! Diverse menu. Salsa bar. Seating indoors and out. Gum ball machines. Friendly staff. Low prices. Quick. Tasty food. Kids meals. Everything you could possibly need, assuming you don't need white table cloths.  Taquitos Jalisco does look a bit sketchy from the outside, but the interior is actually quite nice. Come on in! The restroom could use a remodel, but that's my only criticism. No big thing. They do charge 50 cents for the use of credit and debit cards, but that's a small price to pay for keeping the menu prices so low.  A "go to" Mexican spot if you're in the area of Broadway & Alma School or Extension.

A fun spot for kids. Dodge ball. Long trampolines. Rock climbing wall. Foam pit. Basketball hoops. Young kid area. Snack bar with television. Seems pretty safely designed overall, but the waiver you must sign before your kid can play does force one to pause and reflect. (I'm sure my eight year old self could have easily found a way to hurt myself here.) Special socks must be worn. They're included in party pricing, but otherwise cost $3. They can be reused on your next visit.  We recently hosted a birthday party at AZ Air Time attended by fifteen six year old girls. Yes, fifteen of them. They all had a blast! No injuries!!! You bring a birthday cake and the venue provides the drinks and pizza. The kids play until staffers announce over the loudspeaker that your pizza is ready. Even though the pizza was age appropriate (cheese only), it was quite good (NYPD!!!). Pitchers of lemonade and water provided. A young employee helped pour drinks, serve the pizza and even cut the cake. Not unreasonably priced, but it becomes more costly if you want be in an area with more privacy. Be forewarned. When your two hours are up, your two hours are up. The workers will load your gifts on a cart and start preparing for the next group.  FYI, photos of party pricing and individual pricing handouts are now posted on Yelp.  My only concern really, at least as it related to our group, was that AZ Air Time has many different play areas. It was more or less impossible to keep track of all those six year olds! No employee is stationed at the front door to prevent a kid from wandering outside. Fortunately, we had several parents stay and help us monitor the chaos. There were also lots of young staffers monitoring the different activity areas. They were universally friendly and patient with the kids.  Overall, a good party choice if you're willing to risk a bump or bruise. And the kids will sleep well that night.

Don't let the donut in the name of this café scare you away. It is an awesome donut shop, but it is much more.  To start with, they are very friendly in a quiet sort of way. All you need to do is sit for a while and watch the steady stream of regulars on a Saturday or Sunday morning to know this café has a loyal following.  We were all about donuts on our most recent visit. They have all the flavors you could possibly desire, even bowing to recent trends like a maple long john with bacon. We passed on that choice, instead opting for a heavy dose of rainbow sprinkles. The raised donuts are light, soft and delicious.  Consider the Baker's Dozen, a best buy, if you are taking donuts to go. The fourteen count drops the price to about 70 cents a donut, a few cents less than the standard dozen.  The diversity of menu offerings will no doubt surprise you. They have an extensive menu of sandwiches, soups, salads, Panini, breakfast burritos, muffins, bagels...  They also have convenient group pricing for lunch and breakfast items, so you can bring more than just donuts to the office.  Open seven days a week, 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. The folks here are really nice. Give them a try.  09/2714 Update: The croissant breakfast sandwiches were delicious (and huge)! More importantly, a very picky coffee drinker in our group LOVED the pumpkin spice coffee and the syrup station. Thought she was going to settle in for the entire day. In an interesting turn of events, the four year old in our party passed on the usual rainbow sprinkles and opted for a glazed red velvet cake donut. And loved it!

An amazing value. You select two cookies, your favorite flavor of ice cream, and assemble it into an ice cream sandwich. All for just two bucks!!! The cookie assortment is good: Peanut butter, snickerdoodle, red velvet, chocolate chip, funfetti...  The selection of ice cream is more than adequate as well, with about a dozen flavors available: Chocolate chip mint, salted caramel, cookie dough... I'm shocked every ASU student isn't at least 30 pounds overweight with Slickables so nearby!   The cookies are soft, chewy and delicious and the ice cream is the classic Thrifty brand. You could make the argument that there are better cookies and ice cream available separately elsewhere, but for the price, this is a perfect combination.  Slickables is located, a bit hidden, right next to the Steak n Shake on Mill Avenue. There are only three tables inside the shop, but the ice cream sandwiches are served in a cup and can be easily eaten while strolling down Mill Avenue. This is one of only three locations (Tempe, Mesa and Riverside,CA). Lucky us.

Wonderful annual event. Claims to attract 200,000 visitors, with nearly 500 artisans and food providers. I can't confirm the attendance numbers, but I can verify that there were a lot of booths from which to choose.  Admission is free. Parking is free. A bit of a small town feel, such as ordering lunch from the local Kiwanis group, but with a high volume of vendors. Plenty of pottery, dog hats, jewelry, art work, crafts... pretty much everything you don't really need. Some standard. Some unique. Some expensive. Some remarkably cheap.  I only purchased food. That's how I roll! But others is my group bought earrings, dog bowls and well, I'm not certain what else. Fun was had by all. The little ones most enjoyed the Post cereal samples and running in the park by the fountain (both free).  We'll definitely be back next year.

I like Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ. I like the rustic décor. I like the menu. I like the friendly staff. I like the televisions. I know that the area consensus is that neighboring Rudy's BBQ is the better choice, and that may be so, but Can't Stop Smokin' is a solid alternative when the lines are out the door at Rudy's. The food, from meats to sides to sauce, is consistently good, but far from the best BBQ restaurant fare I've ever experienced. Ordering is a little confusing the first time in. Just grab a metal tray and wait your turn. Some young guys with very sharp knives will walk you through it.

I suggest you order the Bacon Flight, a sampling of eight varieties of bacon, to accompany whatever else you are ordering. You'll then be on your way to refining your bacon palette. The flight will add about nine bucks to the cost of your meal, but it's a delightful item to share if you are socializing with friends or family. Every visitor to The Oink Café needs to order the flight at least once.  Servers at Oink are very friendly and helpful. They do a nice job of making recommendations and keeping your coffee cup filled. The café itself finds a middle ground, with solid food served at reasonable prices. Not a cheap diner nor a too trendy premium dining spot. The menu is not that innovative, except for a willingness to throw bacon into anything, which is fun. Ordering the eight bacon flight is essential to appreciating the bacon varieties. If nothing else, you'll then know which bacon to request on your next visit. If you don't have this basis for comparison, you'll just think the bacon with your meal is well, bacon. You won't be able to appreciate what differentiates Oink from other breakfast spots.  The restaurant is housed in an odd long and narrow space, but there's a deceptive amount of seating. There can still be a wait, however, at peak times. There is also a small dog friendly patio for outside dining. Oink is kid friendly, with a "little piggies" menu and a pig to color while waiting to be served. If you appreciate art, you'll enjoy the large number of the pig masterpieces from previous diners on display.

I can't speak to issues of scheduling... but this sports complex is great from the viewpoint of an adult hoping to watch a child play soccer on a well maintained field and in a safe environment. Plenty of room for setting up chairs and constructing your own shade on the sidelines. Public restrooms available (not wonderful, but they exist).

Clean. Bright lighting. Security cameras. Television. Discounts at non-peak times. Numerous washers and dryers of varying sizes and costs. They all seem to be working. I visited to use one of their huge 80 pound capacity washers. Worked well. Didn't care for the Easy Pay system. Forced you to load money onto a special card to use the washers and dryers. Inevitable that you'll be left with an odd amount on the card. Okay if you are a regular user, I suppose. Overall, a great option if you're in need of a self service laundry.

Emerson Fry Bread was a participant in Food Faire, a special event at Kierland Commons for the benefit of Arizona foster children.   I'm a frequent, although not always voluntary, attendee of festivals and the like. I'm a sucker for Indian fry bread, often popping for an Indian Taco or some variation. Almost always disappointed. Fortunately, today was not one of those days.  Emerson's fry bread was hot and light. The chicken filling was tasty, spicy and free of grease. Even the corn chips, thrown on the side of the plate as an apparent afterthought, were great. Friendly, energetic, service as well.  I'll definitely seek out Emerson Fry Bread in the future.

I'm not one to get too excited about an auto parts store. These stores exist only because they have to exist. The folks that work at this one, however, are exceptional and deserving of comment.   I've have many experiences at auto part stores over the years, often buying a battery or windshield wipers or... usually when time is short. Sometimes they offer to pop them in for you and sometimes they don't. Sometimes you have to beg for help or sometimes you just have to do it yourself. The industry trend in recent years has been to offer more help, but that still doesn't mean they'll be quick or be happy about it.  This visit was for an emergency battery replacement in advance of selling a car. They popped out the battery and I was on my way in under ten minutes!!! I didn't need to beg for help. I didn't even ask for help. They simply helped me in a very efficient and pleasant manner.   Thanks O'Reilly. I'll be back when I need wipers.

A great no sales pressure way to try a few cars on for size. To take a test drive or two. To breath in that new car smell. To come home with a plethora of free tote bags!   New models of virtually all major automobile manufacturers are represented.   Even though the show is essentially a massive advertisement, attendance is not without cost. Parking is $12 and admission is $10 or $11 per adult. Still, not a bad way to spend an afternoon.

Awesome donut shop. While Bosa Donuts does serve a few other things, they specialize in donuts. They're what Dunkin' Donuts use to be, unconcerned that their offerings are not especially healthy or in vogue among foodies. Thank goodness!  I suggest you take a four or five year old to the Country Club location and let them gaze at the eye level cases full of goodies. (That's what we recently did.) Be prepared to buy a pink frosted donut with rainbow sprinkles! Then try to convince yourself that it was a mistake in parenting as you watch your child's eyes pop in delight as they take their first bite. There will be other days for healthy alternatives!!  Open 24 hours!!!

What you've read in other reviews is true. Rusconi's American Kitchen is a gem. You don't expect much from the parking lot, with the restaurant lodged in between a Panda Express and an modest Italian joint, but it's delightful once you're inside. One in our party, an individual still depressed by having to return to Arizona after living in Manhattan, stated, "It reminds me of a restaurant I would have gone to in New York City, but with cheaper prices."   Our favorite dish, odd given all the wonderful entrees we were served, was the White Truffle scented Mac N Cheese. Who knew? Searching to find something to critique, I might say it was a little loud inside, but the we were there on a Saturday night. Further, the front wall of the restaurant was open for patio seating, causing a bit of a draft on this cold night. Solved by a sweater. But those are small things. Rusconi's excelled in the big things: food and service.  Definitely make a reservation if you are planning on dining here during a busy time. With 300 yelp reviews averaging four and a half stars, this gem is no longer hidden.

We've been considering renaming our dog Mister Itchy. Or Sir Scratch-a-lot. Just one consultation with Dr. Song, after months of frustration, has thankfully set us on a path toward resolving the issue. Finally! If only we had found Animal Dermatology sooner.  Dr. Song has a very patient and reassuring demeanor. After already having had our pockets picked with tests, medications and special foods, I must confess that I was not optimistic. We chose Dr. Song over a larger, more corporate, animal dermatologist group. That group charged a slightly higher initial consultation fee and indicated that we might be looking at $800-$1,200 in tests. Animal Dermatology gave no indication of eventual costs, a bit of a concern, but we opted for this smaller practice anyway. Thank goodness.  We did not feel at all rushed during our $142 consultation. Dr. Song answered our numerous questions patiently and laid out treatment alternatives in a logical and easy to understand way. Notably, none of the alternatives included $1,200 tests or $100 a bag dog food for life. He instead opted for lower cost solutions first. He also helped explain why our previous treatment efforts had failed to resolve our problem and how to avoid repeating those mistakes. We may still end up with more expensive solutions at a later date, but at least we'll know we exhausted other alternatives first. We also found Dr. Song's comments regarding many trendy premium dog foods to be insightful.   The Animal Dermatology office is situated on the Northeast corner of 16th Street and Glendale Avenue in an easy to miss little structure wedged in next to the canal. It's very conveniently located just off of the 51.  I'll update the review if there is a problem down the line, but we feel we have finally been given the tools to finally help Sir Scratch-a-lot.

Awesome ride for young kids. Who needs the Disney monorail when you have the Sky Train? We once visited the airport just to ride it. No problem convincing the grand kids to meet grandma at the airport anymore.  At a cost of well over a billion dollars, you have to wonder if there wasn't a more cost effective way to connect the three terminals and light rail. Put aside those thoughts. Enjoy the sparkly floors.

Very nice folks run this little food court spot. I assume it's family owned. You can watch them prepare your food fresh before your eyes.  I always order the $5.99 special, which includes a drink and a generous serving of teriyaki chicken served on, in my case, a huge bed of vegetables. They kindly allow me to pass on the starch and just give me more veggies. The California rolls aren't bad either.  They offer a frequent diner card which entitles you to a free teriyaki chicken or California roll after six meals purchased. Did I mention the free drink refills?   Not the best Japanese cuisine I've ever had, but far from the worst. The main appeal, I think, is the consistency of the people working at Osaka. Not at all what you would expect at a food court. Great.

One of the best fast casual concepts around. And it's right here in Phoenix at Seventh Street & Osborn! The line to order can be long, but it moves quickly. The friendly counter staff will walk you through your options as needed. You choose it, fill it and cover it. It's a process any Chipotle regular will feel comfortable with - plus, they have tortilla soup!   Two recommendations for first time visitors: 1) go "Christmas style" with both green and red chile, and 2) go half and half filling your enchiladas. That way you can maximize what you sample so you'll know what to order next time. And there will be a next time!  There is a small dog friendly outdoor patio in addition to indoor seating. The patio is very pleasant right after sunset even though it's on a busy street.

As Goodwill stores go, this location is definitely a five star destination. We've had luck here with children's toys & books, furniture and household items, the result of the demographics of the surrounding area, I guess. Nicely laid out and well maintained. As an added bonus, there are also some pretty good restaurants nearby for when you are finished shopping.   Pricing is generally very reasonable, but like all Goodwill stores around Phoenix, some of the prices are set a little high with the idea that you'll be getting a discount of some type. The best deals are every other Saturday when everything in the store is half price. Sundays are 25% off days for teachers. Tuesdays are 25% off for 55 year old plus shoppers. A designated color of tag will also always be half price, changing each week. Look for the sign near the entrance.  Perhaps the easiest discount is the online coupon, usually 20% off a $10 or more purchase, emailed monthly when you sign up. Be aware new or holiday merchandise will not be included in any of the discounts. That said, Goodwill is all about scoring a deal AND helping out the community. This Goodwill has a lot of friendly employees, living reminders of the good work Goodwill is doing.  No guarantee that you'll find the bargain of your life, but come on in for some entertaining browsing and support Goodwill. Bring a donation for them to sell. And round up your purchase price to the next dollar when you check out.

I'll admit to some healthy skepticism whenever I see a restaurant touting cage free eggs and organic milk and local produce and the like.  Not that I don't love all those things. I do. But I fear it might be like the restaurant with horrible food that people keep going to because the great view. Often we are so focused on doing the right thing with our choices that we might accept a little less in the way of flavor to be socially responsible. Fortunately, my skepticism was totally unwarranted in the case of the Original Breakfast House. It's a gem.  Do try the pancakes. The lemon they add to the batter can be sensed immediately at the table. The taste, the odd mix of buttermilk and lemon, is unique and wonderful.  OBH uses Mrs. Butterworth's syrup, a plus, and offers Vermont maple syrup for just a buck more, a nice option.  The French toast is a treat as well. They use thick cut sourdough bread deep fried in a batter containing hints of orange, cinnamon and vanilla. Fresh raspberries were offered as a special on one of our recent visits.  Two dollar and fifty cent kids meals make OBH a very kid friendly destination. Options include French toast, mini pancakes with bacon and a two egg cheese omelet.  The two youngsters that accompanied us on one of our recent visits loved the choices.  One small disappointment. Sometimes the simplest things present the greatest challenges, in this case serving hot and fresh toast. The sourdough toast served to one in our party was cold and dry. Even homemade strawberry preserves were not enough to make it edible. I guess they should have used the bread to make more delicious French toast. Everything else was so wonderful (did I mention the green chili omelet?) that it did not really matter.  The staff is young, energetic and friendly. I'm not quite a true regular at OBH as of yet, but I'm planning on becoming one.

Great little spot for lovers of pho. Modest. Comfortable. On this visit we deviated from having just pho, which is a difficult decision since the pho here is so good. We ordered two shrimp with rice dishes to accommodate the tastes of two youngsters in our party. It was totally unnecessary. The young ones loved all three varieties of pho we ordered. Playing with noodles is just too much fun. But they also loved the grilled shrimp and rice. To complete the evening, the servers were very sweet and generous in presenting the kids with fortune cookies. A great time all around.

Cholla Cove Park is a wonderful little neighborhood park situated between Village Fairways to the west, Villas at Hidden Lakes to the north and The Springs at Hidden Lakes to the west. A fantastic resource for all these residents and no doubt a boost to their home prices.  The park is small. Not a destination in itself. But it packs a lot of appeal into its small space. Want to picnic? Check! Play basketball? Check! Sand volleyball? Check! Exercise? Check! Kick a soccer ball? Check! Swim? No, be serious. Swing? Slide? Climb? Check! Check! Check!   Thank you City of Phoenix for maintaining this little gem of a park so well. You'll see me here nearly every week. I'm the old guy injuring himself playing with a four and five year old.

Stick with the coffee. We ordered a breakfast croissant - stale, greasy and smashed - and bagels and cream cheese - fine but far from fresh. Next time I'll get to the airport ten minutes early and head down the hall to Matt's Big Breakfast.

I know it's the airport. I know it's the middle of the night. But the cinnamon scone I ordered was extremely dry (aka stale), bordering on inedible. Only my imagination, piecing together in my mind what it might have tasted like early this morning (or yesterday), boosts the rating to two stars.

Fresh ingredients. Entrees skillfully prepared. Flavorful results. I have yet to be disappointed by any menu item. This visit? The pot pie, AZ hamburger, pretzel app and cookies (free yelp promo), all great.  Twenty percent discount for students. Don't worry U of A and NAU. The discount is not just for ASU students.   A lot of diversity in diners. Some students, some professionals. A great vibe. If you're like me, you'll forget you're in Phoenix. Don't get me wrong. I love Arizona. But it's fun to be fooled by décor and feel that you've been beamed elsewhere.  Very kid friendly. Three dollar kid's meals, with a donation going to feed hungry children in Phoenix with every kid's meal sold. How nice is that?  Dog friendly as well. We sat on the patio with our pooch in tow. Upon being seated, the waiter brought water for the humans and the canine in our party.

What's a Yelper to do when they've written a few too many restaurant reviews? Go to MedShape Scottsdale of course! At least that's been my solution.  The people at MedShape Scottsdale are very thoughtful and supportive. Layla and Nina are fantastic! And they've been here for quite some time. This continuity, in the event you suffer a Yelp induced weight setback, is reassuring.  It is costly to get started, but if you shop and compare you'll find that Medshape is very affordable compared to the Red Mountains... of the world. Ask for discounts. The staff will work with you to find them. And will not gouge you when you are restarting. I had great success here and have managed to keep most of the weight off. Stopping in now to lose that last little bit again. Oh well. Helpful faces, not judgmental ones, awaited me.  They offer a variety of plans: HCG, B-12 shots, all sorts of twig and berry solutions for melting belly fat and reducing wrinkles. There is also a bit of selling of Medshape snacks and supplements. They're not necessary for most people and they won't be pushed on you if you don't show an interest. I'd suggest you go basic to keep costs in line and then add things later only if you really need them.   As for me, I'm paying for the weekly weigh-in with an understanding and friendly face. Don't know why it works, but you don't want to disappoint Layla and Nina.

Great location. Great coffee. A dog friendly patio. Kids meals. A selection of pancakes that might as well be desserts. Friendly hostesses and servers, for the most part. Cute surroundings. So what's not to like?   Noise this day made conversation a bit difficult, but that's me being a nitpicky Yelp reviewer, the kind I try not to be. I suppose the wait often required to get a table can be a more significant issue. There really is no off peak time at Snooze on the weekends. We usually opt for a very early or very late strategy, but this Saturday we showed up forty-five minutes before closing and still had a five minute wait just to put in our name and had another fifteen minute wait to be seated. There's really no easy solution for the unpredictable waits unless you have a flexible weekday schedule. Given the multitude of great breakfast spots in Phoenix, traditional and otherwise, you have to ask yourself if the food and ambiance at Snooze really is distinctive enough to be worth the hassle. For me? Usually not.   But every once in a while the "Flight" three pancake assortment calls my name. This day our table shared a total of six different pancakes, a fun dining experience I'd recommend if you're comfortable sharing.

An hour of my life that I will never get back. I just wish I had more confidence that this effort was materially helping air quality. ADEQ's own sign, to paraphrase, says blame the Feds, not us. On the bright side. the fellow who helped me this visit was very nice, the sole reason for two stars rather than one.   All those cars waiting in line, wasting gas, emitting fumes, killing the productivity of their drivers; well, it's difficult to understand. With all the policy wonks our there, it seems like someone could come up with a better solution. At least they take Visa, MasterCard and American Express.

Maybe it's a guy thing, but I love this place.   I've visited on perhaps 15 or 20 occasions, finding different items, ready for repurposing, every time. It's a do-it-yourselfer's dream! That said, if you see something you like, buy it. It may not be there tomorrow.  So what types of things you will find? A lot of gold chromed lighting fixtures and shower doors. A lot of oak cabinets. Very 70's. Very 80's. All the things Millennials who watch HGTV are immediately pulling out of the homes they buy. Need to match a fixture at your grandmother's house? This is where you'll find it!  Do not despair, however, there are contemporary gems to be found as well. You just need to be a frequent visitor to find them. And the kitchen cabinets... at these prices... they can be refinished. You'll also find doors, dishwashers, ovens, sinks, bathtubs...   The staff is quite friendly. A very nice non-profit vibe.

Very cute little spot just off of Roosevelt. I love the presentation of the ice cream in Chinese take out boxes, complete with fortune cookies. Love the flights, a sampling of five flavors plus fortune cookies presented in a muffin pan ($7.50). Love the dog friendly outdoor seating. And, most importantly, love the ice cream.   My favorite ice cream flavor this visit? Peanut butter & jelly. Not the most juvenile flavor we ordered believe it or not. Those were Captain Crunch-berry and Lucky Charm based flavors ordered by the kids. Fear not. There are numerous choices for the adult palate as well.

I was skeptical. Do we really need another Mexican grill? But Costa Vida is a solid Chipotle alternative.  Touting their fresh ingredients, Costa Vida is at its core just another variation of the Chipotle/Qdoba concept. Rice, beans, chicken... But the décor is stylish. The staff is friendly. The prices are reasonable. The soda machine is state of the art. All, at least in my still limited experience at this location, with shorter lines than Chipotle.  Conveniently located near the ASU Tempe campus.

Fun concept. The restaurant itself has a clean urban feel. Dog friendly patio. Kid friendly menu. Local beer. Uno on the table. A dog hall of fame in the bathroom hallway. Oh yes. The food is good. If you're a fan of the food truck, you'll love the brick and mortar restaurant.  Our young ones liked the choices on the kids menu. On this visit, one opted for the corn dogs, a pretty filling choice. The other opted for the Frito Pie, messy goodness playfully presented in a Frito chips bag. It was more fun, but not quite as filling. Both were fairly priced at six dollars. The more mature in our group all loved their choices as well, but with the numerous wieners and toppings available, how could you not? Everything under ten bucks. I'm a fan of the Mac Daddy.  I'll confess to not really liking hot dogs. Odd, I know. A childhood farm experience in the Midwest involving older cousins and the making of sausage. No more need be said. Still, Short Leash has won me over. I enjoyed my Mac Daddy beef wiener and the pop it made as I bit into it. Perfectly prepared with the juices preserved. The folks in the kitchen know what they're doing.   Next visit, I'm bring the Labradoodle and sitting on the patio.

"I like it so much I'd like to eat here everyday for forever." That was the comment from a four year old when I last ate at the former location of The Fry Bread House. Fortunately, the food remains as good as ever, not harmed at all when the capacity to serve customers expanded.  A great place for visitors to Arizona who want to sample some genuinely regional cuisine, specifically derived from the traditions of the Tohono O'odham. The Native American craft booths are a fun bonus.   Just don't expect much in the way of ambience. You can sense that the building was once a cheap Mexican food cafeteria. Oh well. Just convince yourself it adds to the charm of the establishment.  I must admit that I do miss the sketchy and cramped confines of the old location, but having a little extra room to dine is nice. It must also be great for the Native American craft vendors to have space inside in air conditioning.  The staff has always been friendly to us. I read some reviews on Yelp that complained of inattentive service... Surprising to me. I'm suspicious that some of those negative comments may be the result of cultural miscommunications. We weren't really greeted when we entered on our most recent visit, but the server who brought our food to the table was very engaging and we were warmly sent on our way as we exited. I'd characterize it as a kind of quiet friendliness that you might miss if you aren't accustomed to it.  Save room for dessert!

Amazing find for a mall food court. A little slow perhaps, but worth the wait. A little expensive perhaps, but it is a mall and it's a refreshing change from the mall norm. Stick to the specials and it's a pretty good value.   We enjoyed a chicken crepe and then shared a Nutella dessert crepe with strawberries with others in our party. The five year old with me was shocked. "What is she doing?!?!" was the reaction when our server poured batter and made our crepe on the spot. The most difficult part of the transaction was the spirited banana versus strawberry debate between the five year old and her four year old sister. The Moga Crepe employee intervened and resolved the disagreement with a game. Very nice! Very unexpected!   If I were to lodge an actual complaint it would be that the food, as delicious as it was, did not resemble the professional photographs posted on Yelp by Moga. It's a food court! I'm not expecting to be served on China like the photographs, but it did create a little disappointment when the dessert crepe was presented to us (photograph posted). Then we tasted the crepe and all was forgotten. I'd delete those photos and let Yelpers replace them with real meals over time if I were Moga. I'd volunteer to take a few more photos if it meant having to eat more Moga crepes.

Consider the Hammered Hog to be a sports bar that serves good BBQ or a BBQ joint that just happens to have an unusual number of high definition televisions. Either way, it's a pretty good choice. On our most recent Monday dinner time visit, the Hammered Hog was definitely a BBQ restaurant. We had the restaurant to ourselves when we arrived, which could have been very worrisome if we were not familiar with the place, but it was mostly full by the time we left. All couples. Mostly middle aged. Not a sports bar demographic at all. Arrive at another time, you might find a bar crowd.  This building was remodeled in recent years when the Hammered Hog moved south from its previous smaller location. The restaurant still feels fresh and clean inside, even though the exterior screams, "I was built in the 70's," which I'm guessing it was. Don't be off put by outside appearances. Come on inside. It's nicer than you'd expect. The dining room is long and narrow, perhaps less than ideal, featuring tall bar style tables near the entrance and lower dining tables toward the back. The bar, the focal point of the room, features a large variety of beers.  On this particular night we ordered a sandwich, the Sammie, which features pulled meat of your choice and one side for $7.50. Tonight's choice was pulled chicken. The bun was fresh and the chicken tender. We opted to add our own BBQ sauce at the table, but they will toss it in the kitchen if you prefer. We actually like to blend the hot and mild sauces together, a significant violation of BBQ etiquette I'm sure, but you do what you have to do. Our second entrée was the BBQ platter with one meat and two sides for $12. We opted for pulled pork. The pork was very generously portioned and deliciously prepared. Leftovers were taken home.   We loved two out of three sides that were served  at our table. "I'd come back just for the baked beans," was one comment. The corn on the cob was also nicely prepared. The potato salad, however, while seemingly fresh and well prepared, was a bit bland. The corn bread that came with the platter was moist and tasty.  Throw in a friendly server, all in all a very good experience. It's only a bit of BBQ snobbery, I guess, that prevents me from awarding five stars. Consider it a strong four, perhaps open to an upgrade after a future visit.

I really like this dog park. Cool urban feel with an old columned school as a backdrop. Stylish fencing. Comfortable seating. Plenty of free parking. Self serve water for the pups. Grass. Generally nice and responsible dog owners. Separate areas for large and small dogs. Open 6:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. A great resource for downtown Phoenix.  I suggest you bring your own clean-up bags just in case. I assume it's a budget issue, but this park relies on random bags placed on the fence by patrons.   The only significant negative I can identify is that the park is a bit dark after sunset. The parking lot is well lit, but the dog areas are illuminated only by neighboring streetlights. Seemingly not a safety issue, although I'd recommend going with a friend in the evening just in case. Monitoring your dog in such low light can be a challenge.  I'll definitely be back.

Firehouse Subs is as good as a chain sub shop can be for kids. It's not just the four Kids' Combos (meatball, turkey & provolone, ham & provolone, grilled cheddar cheese) priced at just $3.99. It's that they include a drink, dessert AND FIRE HAT!!!   First ate at a Firehouse Subs several years ago while visiting Durham, North Carolina. I had never heard of Firehouse and loved the hot subs and the vast array of sauces they had on hand. Believe it or not, Firehouse was the first restaurant in which I ever had Sriracha sauce!  So happy to see that Firehouse's rapid expansion has not undermined their appeal. The employees at this location are fast and friendly. Even gladly changed a television channel for us.

Another fast casual concept. Like it. Like it better than I like Chipotle, the fast casual concept to which Foosia is so often compared. Can't say it's a genuine substitute for going out to a nice Chinese restaurant... but its faster and cheaper and ready to carry out if you like.   You pick a base, a protein, veggies, a sauce... all costing the same with the price determined by your choice of protein. A bit limited. They do have tofu, the preparation of which takes a couple of extra minutes, if you're a vegetarian. The servers will gladly let you sample sauces... before you make your choices. I'm not sure if Foosia is genuinely healthy (Asian food often fools me), but the restaurant does give the illusion of healthy eating, which is an improvement over most fast food establishments.   Thanks to Yelp and Foosia for the free drink offer. Everyone in our party used the promotion without a hint of annoyance from the staff, something I appreciate. Friendly service. Fair price. Quality ingredients. Clean dining room. We'll be back.

A fascinating place to come and browse. Housed in a restored circa late 1800's hotel, the store itself is in some ways as interesting as the merchandise. The merchandise, from numerous sources, is crammed into every nook and cranny over two floors. Some antiques. Some vintage. Some contemporary. Some predictable items, but many unexpected as well. Need some used, hmm vintage, cowboy boots? They have quite a selection. Pricing varies, with some prices a little out of line, but for the most part pricing is very reasonable.  A stop at Antiques & Artisans is a fun add on to any trip to Wickenburg. You never know what you might find. Then walk on down the street to visit the many other locally owned shops and cafes that are located nearby.

Little Miss BBQ is a great place to visit with friends. Best if you like the people you go with because you'll probably be spending a lot of time with them in line. And the industrial location makes Little Miss BBQ seem like a bit of an adventure.  Your adventure will start with parking. We had about a five minute wait for the next spot on this Saturday afternoon. Not bad. The parking attendant was so friendly that we didn't mind the wait. Why so friendly? He was the owner's dad. A real family affair. In fact, every employee seems friendly, happy to be at work.   Next, you will wait in line to order. The wait can be significant, but it's worth it. Once again, bringing friends will help. You'll also be offered water. You'll see bottles of sunscreen sitting about, which might come in handy early in the day (shaded later). There were lot of first timers on this Saturday, so there were a lot of advice seeking conversations between parties. No complainers. Just chill, adventurous diners. About a 45 minute wait this day.  Step inside to order. No more waiting. Your food will be presented to you quickly. There are five or so indoor tables and more picnic tables outdoors (nicely shaded). Clean restrooms too. We opted for the outdoors on this day because we had a couple of puppies in tow. No competition for tables since the pace of the line seems to naturally regulate seating. You can also order take out if that's your preference.   The BBQ? It's really good. Worth the adventure. They serve each meat variety until they run out, which they will. This day? No turkey to be had, but there was plenty of beef brisket, pulled pork... They'll make announcements for those in line and place tape over the exhausted items on the indoor menu board. Matters not. All the choices are good. Order meat by the pound or opt for a sandwich with a single side or a meat platter with two sides. The smoked pecan pie, individually sized to serve one or two, is also great.  Such a well deserved success story. Opening was a challenge, given their unconventional location and unconventional business model. City inspectors were slow to accept the notion that BBQ smokers needed to be outdoors and that massive refrigerators were not required for leftovers, since there were none. With permits finally in hand, Little Miss BBQ has averaged a Yelp review a day since inception, a crazy high number for Phoenix. The staff initially worked 14-20 hour days. Low overhead allowed breakeven at just four briskets a day. They sold the four they needed to by noon their first day of operation. A chef's reputation helps, I guess. Two years later, they've doubled their smokers and found some additional experienced BBQ pullers. How do I know all this? The parking attendant, aka dad, liked our dogs and we started chatting. We were also greeted by his son and were sent home with three free bones for the pups (ask if you're not offered).  Overall? A great outing. Just allow a little extra time and relax.

Despite updating their logo and new advertising emphasizing healthy choices, it's still Peter Piper Pizza. The pizza is affordable. The drinks less so. Game tokens don't go as far as you'd expect because so many games require two or more.  We opted for basic single topping pepperoni and sausage pizzas due to the preferences of the young ones in our party. Not horrible, but... There was one twenty something with us who loved the pizza, however, sentimentally reliving all those birthday parties of her youth.  We came on a Saturday, a mistake of course. Our two little girls (ages four and five) were elbowed out of a game they were learning by an aggressive older boy. I intervened, pointing out he was stealing by taking over their game in progress. His parent was disinterested. Youthful Peter Piper Pizza employees were nowhere in sight. I had to pull the boy away myself. The game area was very chaotic all around. Definitely some more employee monitoring is needed during the busy times.  My suggestion? Go to Chuck E Cheese if you have young children. It's safer for them. The tokens go farther (less confusing for little ones since most games require only one token). Security at the door is better. A minimum wage teenager dressed as a mouse. Even the pizza, while not great, is preferable. And cost is only a little higher.   If you just want a cheap lunchtime buffet, or if your kids are a little older, PPP may still be fine.

The annual Phoenix Chinese Week festival, housed at Hance Park, is a combination of bouncy houses for the kids, entertainment, food for the adults, endless Chinese merchandise and random business promotions. All the makings for a fun outing. The purist, I suppose, might be bothered by the presence of Indian Fry Bread and the like, but there are enough Chinese food options available. We all enjoyed a combo special from MuShu: entrée, chow mien, egg roll and rice for five bucks. Amazing!   The little ones in our group enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken, the bouncy houses, having their names written in Chinese, fans, the koi fish, spinning wheels to win free stuff... In other words, they had a blast. The adults enjoyed pretty much all the same things, plus a free acupuncture session. Interesting.  Those in attendance all seemed polite and friendly. Lots of kids. Lots of dogs. Lots of Chinese. Lots of non-Chinese. A nice mix. And not too crowded. Allow a couple of hours.

We walked in without waiting on a weekday at noon. I was a little surprised by the small size and the décor of the restaurant. Nothing negative, just not exactly what I had imagined after seeing trendy looking photos on Yelp. Menus were laid out on the tables. We selected a table and our beverage order was promptly taken. Already I'm comfortable that this is a place where you can eat a nice lunch and make it back to work on time.   Our server passed when invited to make a recommendation, some more help would have been appreciated, so we simply went with the first two "Signature Burgers" listed on the menu. I know, we're disgracefully unimaginative! I ordered the Blu Burger, menu item number one, and definitely regretted not ordering the American Burger, menu item number two, when they arrived at our table. The American definitely had the stronger visual appeal. The Blu Burger was tasty, however, especially the caramelized onions. The buns not only looked great, but were soft and delicious. Other ingredients all seemed top notch.   The cost of our lunch seemed very reasonable given the quality of the food, but a little pricey given the ambiance of the restaurant. Our tab, for two burgers, two sides of sweet potato fries, one ice tea and one water, was $28, not including tip.  I've never really embraced the gourmet burger fad. That said, it speaks well of the Blu Burger Grille that I'm anxious to return and try it out again. Next time I'll be ready to flip the menu over and customize.

I drop into the Scottsdale location on occasion and was delighted to see that Sweet Republic is part of Sky Harbor Airport's local food upgrade. It's not possible for S.R. to live up to the whole best ice cream shop in North America label, particularly at an airport location. This location is small, but it does have the heart of the Scottsdale menu.  If you relax and forget the "best" label, you'll be delighted by the flavor options and the quality. It is a bit pricey, but so is the Scottsdale location, so it's not just an airport thing if that makes you feel any better. Go for extra scoops and just call it an affordable meal. Better yet, order a vanilla malted after finishing your waffle next door at Matt's Big Breakfast, another local favorite, and call it a chaser. Healthful airport dining at its finest.

Fantastic! Sequoya Elementary School is a public school, part of the Scottsdale Unified School District. After attending Sequoya, students feed into Cocopah Middle School and eventually the highly regarded Chaparral High School.  Sequoya is a wonderful school with talented teachers, involved parents and a demographically strong and diverse student body. No reason for considering a charter school if you live in this area.

Love the way they converted Matt's to an airport concept. Much more successful than the attempt made by Lolo's Chicken & Waffles. For those of you just passing through Sky Harbor, these are both Phoenix institutions worthy of a try.  I think Matt's effort here is more successful simply because they have their own dining space to manipulate, not a shared space. They use it well. Some tables. Lots of counter space for single travelers. Some communal seating. Lots of outlets. Great breakfast food early in the day and a full bar for later. Or breakfast food later in my case. A lunch menu is available as well. And it's all priced pretty reasonably for an airport. Well done.

Okay. How shall I say this? I would rather do pretty much anything than go shopping for furniture. Go to a chick flick instead? Sounds great. Shop for a car? I'd love to interact with some used car salesmen and their managers today. Just don't make me shop for furniture.  That said, Living Spaces is a pretty painless experience. The furniture is not ultra high quality, but it is reasonably priced and of adequate quality for most purposes. Think upscale IKEA. It's a price and quality compromise that's beneficial in this era when so many DIY television shows pressure consumers to constantly change styles and colors.    What to like? The chocolate chip cookies offered when you enter. A free beverage station featuring Starbucks coffee, Tazo tea, and orange or cucumber enhanced ice water. A kids area where you can check in your kids to play video games... while you shop. Cool auto themed strollers for the little ones, available in one or two kid models. The clearance center. Helpful and friendly no pressure NON COMMISSION BASED sales staff.   Delivery is available, costing $99 regardless of how much or how little you buy. Either a really good or really bad deal. You can also transport furniture yourself. This is a large store, with a huge showroom and a big clearance area in the back that I'm told most Living Spaces lack. This seems to be the location that will most likely have furniture is stock when Scottsdale... do not.   I'm not anxious to return (of course), but at least I now know I can enjoy a cookie and a coffee next time I visit.

A solid little taco shop located conveniently (for ASU students & staff) at the NE corner of ASU's Tempe campus. Easy to drive right by on University. Just look for the small strip center with Fed Ex in the front and a variety of ethnic food offerings in the back.  Fast service, great for carry out or dining in their small seating area. Chips and salsa available for those who dine in. Wish there were more choices at the salsa bar than just a red and a green sauce. Love their tacos. Went for a basic beef taco special on this day. Delicious. Not quite as strong on some other items like enchiladas, but solid enough.  Discounts for ASU students and daily specials make this a great option for the university crowd and others nearby. I'll be back.

Dropped off early at the airport. What to do? Lo-Lo's or Matt's? Lo-Lo's or Matt's? I'm a big fan of both restaurants, but have tried neither airport location as of yet. Sometimes proximity to an escalator is all it takes to sway me. Lo-Lo's it is!  I was a bit concerned by previous reviews. Harsh! My reaction to this spot? It's not S. Phoenix. It's not Scottsdale. It's Sky Harbor Airport. If you reduce your expectations accordingly, it's not bad. The staff was very friendly. The Lil Jay, eggs and waffle for six bucks, is not a bad deal for an airport. The cheesy scrambled eggs were great. The waffle suffered from being crammed into a styrofoam container, but was recognizable as Lo-Lo's.   I'm curious to see how they handle the chicken here, so I'll back. Next morning airport visit? Have to check out Matt's.  It's difficult to recreate a local restaurant experience in an airport, especially one as unique as the S. Phoenix Lo-Lo's. Abbreviated menu. Portable delivery. No individualized seating area. Lo-Lo's is still working on it, but they're headed the right direction and I suspect they will eventually get it right.

The servers at Eggstasy are exceptionally, eggceptionally?, nice and helpful. Even the manager twice checked in on our table during our recent visit. I would suggest that you take the advice of your server when ordering. The menu, as structured, is a little confusing. Their advice is not the typical effort to encourage you to trade up or add on expensive extras. It's actually helpful.   Any complaints about Eggstasy? It is loud. On a Sunday morning you can hardly hear yourself think, much less your tablemates' conversations. A few well placed acoustical panels might help, Much better on weekday mornings. The Eggstasy section of the menu, which contains all of the restaurant's unique featured items, appears last in the menu, a curious choice. The portions of these items are huge. You do not want to order them unless you are sharing. Server suggestion that you order an egg oriented menu item and then select a side from the Eggstasy list is the way to go. Why not just lay that out on the menu?  Love the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes, although the cream cheese topping is a bit overwhelming after a few bites. The lemon blueberry French toast is delicious, but is heavy and resembles a banana bread. Not what you might expect from the description. I'm anxious to see what other surprises there are in the Eggstasy portion of the menu. Everything there is dessert-like, however, so be forewarned. A side order, as part of an egg dish, is definitely the way to go unless you have a massive capacity for carbs and sugar.  Have not eaten here with kids in tow, but they do have a kid's menu.  The total tab, for two of us, was $33 including tip. Not unreasonable. Just Scottsdale pricing.  The restaurant décor is a bit mid century, a bit industrial, a bit hipster, a bit modern; that is, a bit fun. The outside patio, which was full when I first viewed it, actually made me laugh when I saw it empty. A good thing.

Awesome small thrift store. Unique founder. Unique mission. Unique merchandise. Friendly volunteer staff. It just doesn't get any better!  The store is situated right next to Alice Cooper's The Rock teen rock music ministry and proceeds from sales benefit teens in our community. It is a little hard to spot from 32nd Street, as its only signage is in its windows, but just look in the aging strip center right behind The Original Breakfast House (also one of my favorites).  Merchandise includes the usual thrift store mix, a fluid assortment of clothing, toys, furniture, musical instruments... dependent upon whatever donors are donating. Pricing is very reasonable. You can find a bargain AND do some good.  Then there is the totally unique. Look for Alice's image in the back of the store. There you will find a variety of hats, shirts, belts and shoes from "Alice's attic." Some are signed. Some are not. There were a lot of unsigned golf hats on our recent visit, perfect for those who would enjoy the novelty of owning a hat that belonged to the avid rocker golfer. There were many autographed shirts. $45 seemed to be the going price for anything signed. Alice is a generous and ubiquitous presence in the valley, with plenty of his autographs floating around. I'd suggest you pick up a signed shirt for your aging Alice Cooper fans/relatives in the Midwest. They'll be thrilled and they don't need to know it only cost you 45 bucks!  And don't forget, it's all for charity. Thank you Alice! Great work!

Mister Cook's Chinese Cuisine is located in a clearly recognizable circa 1970's Taco Bell structure. Worse yet, in a Big Lots parking lot! That said, Mister Cook's seems to be a very promising successor to the Asian restaurant previously housed at this location.   I'm probably being a little generous with a five star review, but I wanted to get your attention. The ambiance does leave a little bit to be desired. I think they are still using the original Taco Bell seating! You order at the counter and food is served to you on a Styrofoam plate on a red plastic tray. You have your choice of chop sticks or plastic utensils. Mister Cook's is all about the food. And I'm fine with that!  I love all the dishes I've tried (so far). The menu is pretty standard Americanized Chinese, with all the usual items included. They do have a "Diet Menu" with five choices. And a $7.45 per person dinner special. They have a nice lunch special, served daily 11:00 - 3:00, priced at $5.25 - $6.35, depending on your main dish, served with rice and soup. I started with the Kung Pao Chicken and plan on working my way through the rest of the menu over time.  Mister Cook's is open seven days a week. They also offer take out and delivery. I'm looking forward to returning and hope to see the early opinions of some other Yelpers as well.

First visit to The Normal was very promising. For those of you who are new to Arizona, ASU was previously known as Tempe Normal. Thus, the name. Love it. Located at the newly remodeled hotel now known as the Graduate. Love that name as well. Great location near Gammage Auditorium and the W.P. Carey School of Business.  The restaurant has been nicely redone. No evidence that it was once an IHOP. A kind of retro feel. Very welcoming. Very friendly server who helped the vegetarian with whom I was dining maneuver the menu. We sat in place for a long time after our meal and felt no pressure to vacate our booth. Loved the use of vintage Western paperbacks to deliver the tab.  Greeted promptly when we entered. Seated immediately. Offered beverages. Order taken the moment we were ready. Yes, perhaps evidence of a three week old restaurant with employees who are trying hard to please, but I sensed it might be sustainable. I was a little concerned The Normal might be positioned to become just another bad hotel restaurant.  Happily, this does not seem to be the case.  We only sampled two items. The burrito, modified for a vegetarian pallet, was excellent. The blue corn pancakes were unique. I would order them again, but they were a bit much by themselves and I would consider splitting entrees with a friend next time. I mentioned on a comment card that some color on the plate, perhaps just a slice of orange or the like, would help with its presentation and could break the taste. We appreciated The Normal's emphasis on sourcing locally...  Not priced for starving students. Not too high priced. Just a little. The folks dining at The Normal this night appeared to be local, not captive hotel guests, which was nice.  Five stars. While the food and surroundings were nice, it was the high level of customer service that made the difference.

So often you read mentions of local "hidden gems" on Yelp. What to do then when you actually find a hidden gem? A gem that really is local and hidden. Literally! My solution? Recognize one's limitations as a reviewer and embrace the clique! Did I mention Sugar Jam Bake Shop is a hidden gem?  IT'S HIDDEN: I've driven by Sugar Jam Bake Shop dozens of times and never knew it was there. Only a booth at a street fair and a follow up investigation on Yelp led to this lunch visit. Sugar Jam is located in an aging office building near the Scottsdale airport (NW corner of Hayden & Redfield Roads). No real signage on Redfield Road other than temporary placards placed outside to try to attract your attention. Parking is in the rear. Enter through a shaded courtyard. Once inside? Charming. Charming. Charming.  IT'S A GEM: Dana, the owner, greeted us at the counter as we came in on this day and then later came over to check up on us and chat. Nice. This gave us a chance to ask about the upcoming (10/1/2015) change in lunch menu. Fear not. Dana's baked goods will remain untouched, but she's bringing in "Phil the Grill", a "Pitmaster Chef", as "seen on Chopped", to enhance lunch offerings with pulled pork mac and cheese and the like. Sounds promising, particularly in light of how good the menu already is.   Our lunch items, a turkey Panini and a mac and cheese with salad, were both great. Don't know though if they'll make the cut for the new menu. You can order bagged lunches to go if you like. We, however, dined in. It's just too cute a spot for us not to. Seating is limited. Some folks were settled in studying for school and reading newspapers while sipping from oversized coffee cups. Regarding dessert, every baked good we have tried has been fantastic. The namesake sugar jam cookies were a delight at the street fair. I was expecting a petrified jam-like substance adhered to stale sugar cookies. Instead, the jam was fresh and the cookies soft. Delightful. We had some again today. Small fruit pies were also flakey and flavorful. Not too sweet. Not too tart. Perfect. I'm anxious to try other pies, like the pecan sweet potato. I'm just going to have to return to Sugar Jam again and again and again until I've sampled the entire baked good menu. A sacrifice I know.  Sugar Jam does bake in quantity for special events. A multi pack of a specialty chocolate mousse, making me rethink the concept of a twelve pack, was being readied for pick up as we were leaving. Dana showed it to us when she overheard us expressing interest. I would have liked an invite to that party.   IT'S LOCAL: Sugar Jam is the very definition of a small local business deserving of local support. Hours are limited, open only M-F 8:30 a.m.- 2:00 p.m. as of this date, but I suspect they might expand hours with the change in season and/or menu. I hope so. I've now sampled Sugar Jam twice. Met the owner Dana twice. Met the owner's husband once. Know a bit about their kids. Feel a little like I know them, or at least know them well enough to want to support their endeavor. Planning on becoming a regular. You should too. If you can find this hidden gem!

So far, so good. Enjoyed my first and second visits to Señor Taco. The staff was friendly. There was a little communication issue during ordering, but that's not a bad thing. It wouldn't be a true Mexican taco shop if there wasn't a little initial confusion.  Service was a bit slow on the first visit, but much faster on the second. The food was great, the salsa bar was solid and there was plenty of seating, indoor and out. There were even some easily accessible electrical outlets on the wall left over from a previous tenant. My only true objection was the late afternoon sun that blinds west facing diners.  I noted another reviewer complained about the cost. Didn't seem that unreasonable to me. In fact, use of the $5 specials and Tuesday deals could make it downright cheap.  There are plenty of traditional style taco shops in other parts of the Valley. But not here. A nice addition to the neighborhood.

FYI, Home Fur Good's old location just up 32nd Street had eight reviews and a five star average. It's unfortunate those reviews have not transferred over to the new location.   Remember folks, this is not PetSmart, even though Home Fur Good does do adoption events there. It is a non profit volunteer rescue organization and should be evaluated as such. With that perspective in mind, HFG can only be considered to be awesome!  I've never volunteered here. Never adopted a pet here. But I have had several interactions with HFG, all good. They have been nothing but kind and professional. Most recently, we visited this location to see a dog that was available for adoption. They were amazingly patient with us. Two long visits and an adverse family allergy reaction later, I'm afraid this pooch had to find a forever home elsewhere, but a very positive impression had been made by the volunteers at HFG. We bought a few items at the small gift shop they operate on site, perhaps out of guilt, and went on our way.  Yes, they do hold vaccination and microchip events every Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Very affordable. Check their website for detailed pricing.  http://homefurgood.org/clinic/   Thanks HFG. We'll be back!

This is the sixth and newest location for US Egg, an Arizona based restaurant concept. Six locations? Do we now call it a chain? Hard to say. This location is nicely done, a bit larger inside than what I expected based on the exterior. With Butterfield's located a couple of blocks to the East and Eggstasy located a couple of blocks to the West, this stretch of Shea Boulevard may become a destination for breakfast lovers. It could be a competitive challenge for this newcomer, but it will be nice to have a new alternative when the lines are out the door elsewhere.  The protein pancakes are US Egg's greatest strength. Filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and almonds, it's a bit of a stretch to think they're really that healthy, but they are certainly delicious. The "Half and Half" is a great way to order the pancakes and to sample some of the rest of the menu. You receive two small protein pancakes, an egg and a half sized hot skillet. We also ordered some whole wheat pancakes, US Egg's standard pancake, on this day. I'm sure they were better for me than some fluffy buttermilk pancakes I could order elsewhere, but they are forgettable. Stick with the protein pancakes!

Not an ideal location, but Classic Crust does have great pizza. On second thought, the location is not all that bad. If the line is out the door at Carolina's (next door) and you are not in the mood for Noodle & Rice (across the street), Classic Crust Pizza is a great choice. Mexican, Asian and Pizza! All the major food groups in one spot!    What to love about Classic Crust? The pizza crust! Wonderful consistency. Not at all "yeasty". Small, basic, modern, comfy dining room. Tables that can be rearranged for different size groups. Big screen televisions. Reasonable prices. Local ownership. Local beer. A Yelp deal for free garlic knots or free zepolli, light bundles of bready joy.    We ordered two signature specialty pizzas on this visit. Both were great. We used a paper coupon and the staff still kindly honored the Yelp bonus, even though they could have easily denied one discount or the other based on the fine print. We'll be back due to that treatment alone. They were also very patient when a six year old insisted on helping place the order for our party of six. Very nice. There's also a great two slice lunch special.  The brief history of the restaurant, quickly progressing from a portable brick oven to taking over a failed pizza parlor location (early 2015), might suggest the owners are getting a bit ahead of themselves. This is not the case. Yelp reviews have been very complimentary and an Arizona Republic write-up was outstanding. All well deserved.

Some reviews are just pleasurable to write. Noci Café is a small family run restaurant/bakery/coffee shop that is simply exceptional. A perfect spot for brunch.  Noci is small. Perhaps eight tables indoors and a similar number outside. There can be a problem finding a table at peak times or if a large group shows up, but most hours it's not an issue, especially if you don't have a preference whether you sit indoors or out. The outdoor seating is shaded and on the north side of the building, making it quite comfortable most of the year or just requiring a sweater if it's the cool season.  The menu features breakfast and lunch items, served all day. Additional menu items are posted on a chalk board behind the counter. Noci is open from 7:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. weekdays and 7:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. on weekends. You may just stop in for a coffee or bakery item to go if you'd like. On this early afternoon visit, our party opted for breakfast, lunch and baked goods. And why not? All were exceptional. The panini? Great! The burger? Great? The breakfast platter? Great! The muffin? Great! You get the idea. If there is a weakness in the menu, we have yet to find it. One of our young ones didn't care for the fruit and granola yogurt concoction she ordered from the kids menu. The yogurt was too tart for her young taste buds. Our waitress/wife/co-owner noticed the predicament and suggested adding honey. Problem solved. Not a speck left in the bowl. Even lowly potatoes, hash browns and French fries, were amazing. When have you ever eaten hash browns as a finger food? We did today at Noci.  The family vibe of the establishment makes dining at Noci a true pleasure. Service is always friendly and accommodating. Midway through this meal our soon to be seven year old floated the idea of having her birthday party at Noci. Don't think we'll do that, out of respect to the owners and other diners, but we will definitely be back to enjoy Noci again and again.

No need for another visit to fully embrace O.H.S.O. Paradise Valley. The patio is awesome. We visited just after 6:00 p.m. on a Monday. Walked right in. Picked up a free homemade dog treat at the counter for the pooch accompanying us and took a seat. 100 degrees outside? No worries. Giant fans and misters kept the patio quite comfortable. Will your puppy be lonely? You must be kidding. There were about ten other dogs on site this night. Will the kids behave? Not a problem. Ping pong... will occupy them. I can't imagine why you would want to go inside to the bar. The patio has such a fun and energetic vibe. Well, the bar might be a better choice for you if you hate dogs or hate kids or hate dogs and kids. For the rest of us? Embrace the chaos.  Oh yes. They do serve food. Our server was very helpful, sitting with us in the booth for a moment to review the menu and local beer options. I get the sense that they've figured out the service issues that several reviewers mentioned early on. We opted for one of the mac and cheese dishes and one of the hamburgers. Both were outstanding. Not at all the mediocre bar food I was expecting. And yes, the pup loved the free treat. He had to have seconds. The water bowl they gave him (without asking) came in handy as well.  We can't wait to come back. The outdoor game concept is pretty common these days, but the extent to which O.H.S.O. embraces our canine friends separates it from the pack.

I'm a fan. We stopped in for a family breakfast and had a great time. I look forward to trying out the menu later in the day and enjoying some sports.  We sat in the restaurant area, away from the bar, since we had young kids in tow. We were initially a little hesitant taking the kids into a sports bar, but we should not have worried. The kids breakfast choices were well received by the munchkins (can you say chocolate chip pancakes?) and at five bucks each were reasonably priced given that beverages were included.   The highlight of the visit (for me) involved a random bison head that was positioned above our table. I convinced the five year old in our party that the rear end of the bison could be seen on the other side of the wall. Apparently the five year old was not the most immature person at our table.   The adult breakfast menu was much more extensive than I expected. I thought I was visiting a sports bar that also served food, but it's really a restaurant that also serves alcohol. And happens to have a lot of televisions. The breakfast menu included eggs benedict(s), pancakes, omelets, a senior menu... We opted for some pancakes and a green chili omelet. Great.  Service was friendly and attentive. We had visits to our table from a manager and from a cook who wanted to check out the glaze in the eyes of the five year old eating the chocolate chip pancakes. Perhaps it was just that they weren't particularly busy, but we felt very welcome and it definitely reinforced our desire to return. Probably bumped the review rating from four to five stars as well.   I understand Haymaker is locally owned and that this is their third location. They're housed on the South side of Bell Road, just West of Tatum. FYI, it's easy to drive by without noticing even though it's right on Bell. A great breakfast stop and a solid sports bar alternative.  Oh, by the way. The five year old checked out the other side of the wall and, much to her relief, there was no bison rear end in sight.

Great new BoSa Donuts location. Situated on 32nd Street just north of Shea, it's perfect for anyone about to hop on the 51.  Opened August 14, 2015, this BoSa is housed in what was once a Wendy's. It has the familiar BoSa menu and a roomy dining room complete with sofas. Also a drive thru in case getting out of your car for your donut fix is too much exercise.  Open daily 4:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.   A great addition to the neighborhood.

This small taco shop, open less than a week as of this writing, oozes with potential.   The good? Quality ingredients. Clean functional décor (Chipotle-like rather than Mexican taco shop). Friendly service. A simple menu with lots of variety. Indoor and outdoor seating. Breakfast available. Television. Great location on University just west of ASU.  The not so good? The taco sauce, both green and red, lacked flavor. Definitely needs to be addressed with a reappraisal of these sauces or with more variety. A salsa bar would be ideal. This is Arizona and we are used to heat in our Mexican food. I loved what I ordered and look forward to exploring the rest of the menu, but the taco sauce...  The specials seem to be the best values. The #1 (three tacos, rice, beans, tortilla and drink for ten bucks) is a much more substantial meal than ordering tacos ala carte. My taco was not nearly as generously filled as those in the photo posted on Yelp, an understandable consistency issue I suppose for a restaurant still in training and development mode. The tacos, however, are sized more like street tacos, so at $2.75 each it's important that they be generously filled if the nearby starving student population is going to be attracted.  I'm giving Taco Shack the benefit of the doubt in the star rating because the restaurant is so new. Hopefully I'll be rewarded over time.

A fantastic find for fans of food courts and Pho. I repeat. A fantastic find for fans of food courts and Pho. A fantastic find for fans of food courts and Pho. A fantastic find for fans of food courts and Pho.  Tasty, restaurant quality Pho in a mall food court! Such a pleasant surprise. Moderately priced. Friendly service. Served, not in food court Styrofoam, but in actual bowls. A bowl seems like a small thing, but it makes such a difference when it comes to Pho. Valley Vietnamese Food is a huge step up from the Korean joint that had occupied this same spot. Also seems to be a local family owned business.  The PV Mall food court has really improved of late. Much better options. The court is becoming a destination in and of itself for our family. Perfect if your gang has conflicting cravings. Enough variety for any family. Everyone can get what they want. And don't forget the Coca Cola Carousel for the kids. Situated at the North side of the mall, the food court is most easily accessed by parking in the mall parking garage.

Not the largest Christmas light display in the history of mankind. We'll leave that for reality TV. If you want heart and continuity, however, year after year, this is the spot. Pick a background. Pose the kids. Come back again next year. Repeat.  Easily accessible. Just off 44th Street, south of Camelback. Parking can be a challenge, but there's always a spot somewhere on the street. Just don't block a driveway. The neighbors here deserve a bit of kindness in exchange for their amazing tolerance.   Lots of lights to view. Bubbles for the kids to chase. Window displays full of animated characters. A courtyard in which to walk. Random Christmas decorations for sale. Donate a buck or two to help pay for the electricity. Enjoy hot cocoa ($1) and a cookie or Rice Krispie treat ($1). Let the kids wander in wonder.  One bit of bad news. The resident Christmas dog, now sixteen years old, has been forced into retirement for health reasons. That's 112 years of Christmas joy for us to be thankful for in dog years!

Hungry Howie's is by no means artisanal pizza, but it's a good Pizza Hut/Dominos alternative. Their flavored crusts are unique for franchised pizza. This location has been open only a short time and it's a nice option to have in the neighborhood.  I've had Hungry Howie's pizza in the past and was never that impressed. This carry out order included a thin garlic and herb crust pizza. Stumbled upon something I really liked. I'll admit to being shocked how much I enjoyed it. The original round asiago crust was fine as well, but more at the level I expected.  Much of Howie's business is delivery, but if you do decide to carry out, be forewarned this location is hidden back in the corner of the strip center (SE corner of the intersection, next to Safeway). No space to dine in.  Hungry Howie's is very promotional. Grand opening coupons. Online deals. You should never have to pay full price. This day we received a free large pizza as part of their grand opening. We'll definitely consider Howie's again if we have a large group and need some decent cheap pizza.

Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food is a family affair. You'll see Maria in the kitchen and her son Alfredo at the counter. They are so nice that you might be inclined to award five stars just based on likeability but there's no need. Maria's prior 26 years in the kitchen are on full display. Open only eleven weeks, this tiny restaurant is well on its way to becoming a huge success story.   I haven't had a chance to sample the full menu as of yet, but I intend to over the next few months. A simple chicken taco? Served with white chicken breast meat. Sold! Some of their most popular items are the Frybread Tacos and, of course, the Sopapillas. No bulk processed microwaved refried beans to be found here. They're made fresh on the premises, as is all the food.  The dining room is very small, but there is a small overflow dining room in the back of the restaurant. There are also some orange picnic tables out front, remnants of the Two Hippies business that formerly occupied the space. Maria's doesn't mind your pooch joining you at these tables, but the landlord apparently does, having posted a "no pets allowed" sign back in the Two Hippies era. Dog friendly? Perhaps. You tell me. There is also a drive thru. You'll be rewarded for stepping inside, however, with fresh homemade chips and red and green salsa. There is no kids menu per se, but they will make scaled down versions of some items upon request. Just ask.  importantly, they are listening to their customers and still actively making improvements. They're planning on adding some more vegetarian options and perhaps gluten free items, no easy feat in Mexican cuisine. They're also thinking about extending their hours. And the candy under the counter? Added for nearby high school students who drop in. I suspect they're going to need a bigger dining room!  What impressed me most is when Alfredo approached me on my first visit. "I don't think I've seen you before..." A ten minute discussion about his mom and the restaurant ensued. A few days later, when I visited again, he called me by name. Did I say impressive? I can easily see why Maria's has a five star average on Yelp.

I just noticed Casa Décor hasn't been reviewed in a while. Let me step into the void.  Our family, well, one family member in particular, is a big fan of Casa Décor. How fortunate, the family joke goes, that Casa Décor is having a 50% off furniture sale on a day we happen to be visiting nearby IKEA. Why the joke? Casa Décor is ALWAYS having a 50% off furniture sale (25% off accessories).     What motivated me to write this review, other than the boredom of waiting for others to shop, was our history with the store. We have made several purchases over the years. The pricing, after the usual discount, is always reasonable. We did not thoroughly appreciate the nature of the store, however, until we had a problem.   A young, rambunctious, family member remarkably found a way to break the back of a rustic dining chair we had purchased a year or so earlier. Part of a unique set. Difficult to replace. In desperation, we brought the chair back to Casa Décor and they reacted, "Oh sure. We have a guy who can fix it." What a relief. We left the chair without even bothering to ask what it was going to cost. They promptly repaired the chair in just a few days. We were then amazed to find there was no charge! "It shouldn't have broken," was the explanation. The quality of the repair? We couldn't figure out which side had broken until it was revealed to us. Awesome!  The store represents itself as rustic Santa Fe. That's upscale code for predominantly Mexican furniture. We've had a lot of success finding basic and slightly unusual items at the store over the years. Casa Décor and its competitor, Tucson based Tres Amigos (located in Glendale), have been our go to destinations for reasonably priced Mexican furniture in the Valley.  Embrace your inner Southwest and visit Casa Décor. It's a fun outing. Then head on over to IKEA for a cheap hot dog. Just remember the furniture you buy at Casa Décor, unlike IKEA, will be fully assembled!
