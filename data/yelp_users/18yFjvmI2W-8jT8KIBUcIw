A little late to the party.  I was able to convince my father to get out of this house for what looked to be a great time and great food.  What a DISASTER.  The prior reviews are dead on.  We were so excited to savor the tastings of food trucks but obviously so was the entire population of Scottsdale.  Lines lasted for hours, trucks ran out of food and everyone was grumpy.  Not impressed.

We love Aqua Tots in Scottsdale!  My daughter has been taking lessons for just under a month and she is learning so fast.  The instructors are amazing.  They are extremely patient, personable and adapt to each little swimmers' needs.  The pool is warm, class sizes are small and atmosphere is positive.  It is great to see all the kids progressing and the joy they experiencing when mastering a new skill.  Thank you Aqua Tots for providing a safe, fun place for my daughter to learn to swim.
