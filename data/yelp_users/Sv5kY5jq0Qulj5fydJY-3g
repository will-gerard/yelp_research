Home of some of my biggest airport nightmares of all time. Airline check-in is a nightmare (unless you're flying Southwest, they seem to have their stuff together), Security is a nightmare. Home to a disproportionate number of entitled jerky airline passengers. Ugh. I just hate this place.   Just do yourself a favor, and get there early. You might not need the time every time, but one of these times you will.

Have you seen American Psycho? Set in the 1980s, every character is obsessed with what restaurants are hot, and which are totally over. Everything about AZ 88 made me think of that film, and how they'd be firmly in the latter category.   To be fair, I was only here as an evening drinking destination and not for dinner, but I was shocked at how 80s the place felt (even the name is 88!) and also how empty it was. Typically I'm a big fan of specialty handcrafted cocktails, and their entire list was pretty underwhelming. It certainly didn't seem current.   Patrick Bateman would be horrified to be here. I'd just be incredibly apathetic to return.

Not many things make me say "man, I wish I lived in Phoenix." But Camelback Mountain? It tops the list.   I fancy myself a relatively outdoorsy and athletic guy, and curse the fact that I live in a metro that doesn't exactly feature a ton of outdoor activities. That's why on every business trip to Phoenix I make sure and schedule enough time to get in a quality hike on Camelback. While I've heard some people say that they think it's a tough haul, I don't find it particularly challenging. It's no leisurely stroll, but I also don't think it's any sort of widow-maker.   What is it then? An incredibly convenient opportunity to get your blood pumping while enjoying some gorgeous landscapes. Watching the sun rise over the mountains and creating silhouettes of saguaro cacti is a beautiful opportunity that this midwesterner cherishes. Sitting at the peak and looking over the entire valley is certainly inspiring.   As of this writing the Echo Canyon side is closed for repairs, which is a bit of a bummer. It's the more extreme of the sides, and fills me personally with a greater sense of accomplishment. That being said, the Cholla Trail is nice as well, it just has less steep of inclines. When the whole trail is operational, I'd say go up Echo Canyon and down Cholla Trail, as I wouldn't want to try and descend some of the spots on Echo. But either way, if you're looking for good hiking not far from the city, you're all set with Camelback Mountain.

While I never know what to expect from a hotel restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by how good of experiences I had at ZuZu. At the hotel for four days, I had breakfast here twice, and also enjoyed lunch on two separate occasions (though at the pool rather than in the restaurant itself). All meals were pretty dang tasty, and the price was right.   Let me tell you this: I am pretty obsessed with eggs benedict. When I saw the California Benedict ($13.00) on the ZuZu breakfast menu, I knew its destiny was to be in my belly. In liue of the traditional canadian bacon, it is served with avocado, tomato and spinach. While I guess you could argue that this makes it healthier (and thus more 'California' than a typical benny), when I scraped every last drop of decadent hollandaise off of my plate I certainly didn't feel like it was health food. Instead, I was indulging in one of the bests benedicts I've enjoyed in recent memory. It was so good, I had it for both breakfasts  For my poolside lunches I tried two different meals: The Famous ZuZu Burger ($12.50) and their turkey club. the ZuZu burger was stellar, with crispy bacon, balsamic onions and Maytag bleu cheese. It was cooked pretty much to my liking (maybe a TOUCH over the requested medium rare) and made me a very happy camper. Served with pesto mayo, the turkey club ($12.00) was good but not really all that memorable. I opted to upgrade to fries on the side, which cost me $2. I thought that was pretty weak, as fries are such a basic side, and they weren't fantastic fries by any means.   Service seemed fine at the restaurant, though sometimes a bit inattentive. I mean, nothing to get worried about and it's probably good for me to be reminded to slow down on occasion, but still sometimes I just want the check, you know?   As with everything at hotel Valley Ho, I'm ultimately quite impressed with ZuZu and look forward to being able to return.

I don't know about you, but the one person I would trust most in the field of tacos would be a luchador. If a Mexican wrestler can vouch for an establishments tacos, then really, they've just got to be good. And due to the number of luchador paintings in Cien Agaves, I think it's just a fact that these are some of the most delicious tacos in Old Scottsdale.  These wee little tacos can be ordered a la carte, or in a combo of 2 or 3 plus rice and beans. Go for three. Sure, two would fill you up, but why would you waste an opportunity to try yet another variety of taco? THAT would be ridiculous. I opted for an all seafood night, chowing down on a beer battered ono taco, the island shrimp taco (served with an awesome tangy and sweet sauce), and an ahi tuna taco. The first two were glorious, some of the best i'd ever had. They weren't huge, but they were stuffed liberally. This is especially true of the plump shrimp, which didn't taste remotely Mexican to me, but were delicious nonetheless. I unfortunately didn't care for the ahi tacos, and I love ahi tuna. They weren't bad, just very average. And average looks bad when next to glory.   OH and did I mention habanero-lime margaritas? Sure they have plenty of different, unique flavors (hibiscus, blood-orange, prickly pear, cucumber) but that habero-lime is the perfect mix of refreshing and a kick. I would have had a dozen, if they'd had let me.   Who knows when I'll be back in Scottsdale, but when I am, I'll be sure to chow down at Cien Agaves. And maybe even steal one of those luchador paintings!

BOOOOOO!  Even by airport bar standards, this place is weak. And due to the lack of boozy options in Sky Harbor, it's also packed.   I ordered the roast beef sandwich, and it was pretty darn awful. I didn't finish it, and that's just not something I do. I finish my food, dang it. I opted for baked beans instead of the typical potato chips, and they were luke-warm and bland. The dining companion's wings were ok-ish.   For alcohol, I had a big beer, which tasted like beer. When the dining companion asked for wine, she was asked "what color would you like?" which pretty much sums up the level of knowledge we were working with. Regardless, the pour that came out was ridiculously huge! Order two glasses of wine from here, and you'll sleep like a baby on your flight.   I don't expect gourmet at airports, as they're just by their nature, sad turn-and-burn places. But this place doesn't even clear the low bar of "acceptable airport food." pass.

A hotel bar that I'd visit even if it wasn't in my hotel? That's a guaranteed 4 stars.   I loved the decor, though I'm a sucker for dark woods, low furniture and Edison bulbs. It's all vaguely old-school yet modern. If I had a lot of money, I would design my rec room to look just like this, and throw pretty stellar parties.   The drink list was solid, and a lot of care and preparation goes into their specialty cocktails. I can't recall what I had, but if you're anything like me and your three favorite words are "Scotch, Rye and Whiskey," then you're sure to find something here on which to imbibe. The beer list wasn't much to talk about, but did I mention the Scotch, rye and whiskey?   I was waited on by three different bartenders during my stay, and while one I clicked with more than the others, all three were friendly, knowledgeable and professional.   Why no 5 stars? While I enjoyed the place, it didn't totally blow my mind, and I feel like I've been a little too loosey-goosey with my 5 stars lately. Though don't be fooled, I certainly enjoy this place and if I ever get to stay at the Saguaro again, you'll find me bellied up to the bar at Old Town Whiskey.

Oooh, Shiny!   Much like its hotel host, Distrito is bright, energetic and has a point of view and sense of humor. The entryway sets the tone with a massive wall installation of Dia De Los Muertos skulls (that also seem to have a definite luchador vibe) and as you walk down the steps you know you aren't in for a stuffy occasion. Nope, this place is fun fun fun. Thankfully, it's also quite tasty.   Now, I can only speak for breakfast, but both times I ate here it was fantastic. On my first visit, I was alone and wanted to work through the meal. Once I saw the chorizo eggs Benedict, I knew my decision had been made for me. What came out wasn't what I had expected (probably because I stopped reading the menu after I saw the name of the item), but it was VERY tasty. It's served on brioche rather than the traditional English muffin, and the chorizo is crumbled on the side. The hollandaise sauce was just out of this world. I approve. Before I knew how large the portion would be, I ordered a side of fruit. When that came out I had to laugh, because it was the largest "side" I'd ever seen. Full of melon, grapes and other deliciousness, I had enough food for two people, and ate every bite. The servers kept my coffee full and tended to my needs, while still respecting that I was working and wanted to be left alone.   On my second visit I was with a very large group. I wanted to try something different, so I opted for the french toast. Made with tres leches and served with berries and some sort of heavenly cream, It was AMAZING, however a small portion. I wish that I would have gotten the side of fruit this time, rather than the day before. The staff took great care of our huge group, however they were PRETTY cheesy. I don't need your cornball jokes before I've had my coffee, thankyouverymuch.   I am bummed I never made it here for dinner, but assuming I am back in Scottsdale for work someday, I will lobby hard to stay in the Saguaro once again, so that I can make sure and have some more meals as Distrito. Good stuff. Good stuff, indeed.

So it looks like I have a new favorite place in the universe.   While I'm a loud and vocal proponent of all things mini-golf, I had never before stepped foot onto a driving range. I don't know what I was doing with the past 35 years of my life, but I do know it all sucked compared to my time at Topgolf. This place is the shiz.  When we arrived we were escorted to our reserved stations, which had climate-controlled couch seating in the back, and some pretty dang high-tech tees up in the front. The system is able to scan a sensor in your golf ball and if you hit one of their targets, you get points! Matt Fact: I LOVE POINTS! It's my philosophy that everything in life is a competition, some more obvious than others. If I'm able to objectively show that I scored more points than somebody else, then I'm having a pretty great day.   While waiting for your turn, you can hang back with pretty good food and drink, brought to you be a server. I was particularly fond of the Palomas, and all of the bites I sampled were tasty.   This would be a great date, double date, friend outing, or company team builder. I can't wait until they open a location closer to my home in Portland.

This retro boutique hotel is decidedly unlike any place at which I'd stayed before, and while it took me a minute to warm up to it's charm, I would confidently recommend The Saguaro to any of my friends.   The absolute best thing that The Saguaro has going for it is it's staff. Every single person which whom I interacted was friendly, personable and helpful. They were able to get me into a room laughably early, something I don't think they could know how much I appreciated. The guys that handled valet were just awesome! They were on hand to give me recommendations and advice on the area attractions, and were also just generally cool dudes. I would hang and talk with them longer than necessary because they were just incredibly likeable. I wish they didn't make them wear bandages and such to cover their tattoos, b/c they all look like they were in accidents! They're professionals here, a little ink isn't going to change that! The restaurant staff was quite good at their job, though a touch on the cornball side.   The property is divided into two sections. There is the check-in side that has the restaurant, bar and a coffee shop. Also there is a great big table that is perfect for group working, with plenty of space and plug-ins. The space as a whole is bright, clean, and at once modern and vintage. I want the name of their decorator.   The other side of the property are the hotel rooms, the pool and the gym. The rooms are pretty great. I thought the bed was quite comfortable and the bathroom had great products. I had a beautiful view of the pool through a number of palm trees, which made me feel like I was on vacation rather than a business trip. The only thing I would change would be the sliding bathroom doors. I don't much care for those.   The pool area is just awesome! Huge hot tub butting up next to a long, large pool. If you wanted to swim laps for exercise, you could. If you wanted to party and look fabulous, you could. The bright cabanas and beds and pool chairs, as well as the stellar landscaping made this pool a true oasis. The music was all great, and I like that it was pumped underwater as well. Definitely makes swimming laps more interesting.   The hotel gym is... OK. A decent selection of free weights and machines. Some cardio options. But I really expected more seeing as there's a resort fee attached to this. I rarely stay at places with said fees, but when I do I always feel like they earned it. I just didn't feel that way here. The pool is great,  but I would have liked to have seen a sauna or steam room. The bike rental is a nice touch, but I don't know how often I'd use it. I   Overall, I am a big fan of this property and would come back in a heartbeat. It's a fantastic way to enjoy the Arizona sun.
