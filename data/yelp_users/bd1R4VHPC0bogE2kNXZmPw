My husband found this little place near his office a few years ago.  What a gem.  The owner Jaime, is honest, fast and very good.  He knows what he's doing.  Not the biggest of places, but he has a nice selection of jewelry.  He's designed some custom pieces for us, working on one for me right now and we couldn't be happier.

We've been coming here for almost 30 years.  Evidently since just after they opened we found out the other night.  The food is always awesome, service is good and the smell, yum.  Smells the same way it did 30 years ago, delicious!  Best deep dish pizza around.  Definitely our favorite.

Went on Sunday early afternoon for my mother's birthday since my dad was in the hospital down the street.  Service was ridiculously slow and there weren't more than 20 people in the place. We were a party of three and we saw the waitress a total of four times in the hour it took us to eat and get out.  Asked twice for drink refills and never did get them.  Had to flag a busboy down with a water pitcher just to get that.  Seemed like plenty of staff on hand, they just didn't seem to be paying attention to the diners. Food was blah and pretty tasteless.  Prices seemed high for the quality of food.  The place looks really run down, light fixtures were filthy and half the light bulbs were burned out.  Overall the whole place looked very worn and dirty.  We've gone there for years, but won't be back again any time soon. Not a great experience at all.

We hosted my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary in one of the private rooms upstairs.  This had to be the easiest event I have ever done with any venue.  The food was good, the staff amazing and the evening went off flawlessly.  They allowed us to bring in our own cake and decorations and even coordinated their napkins to our color scheme.  The waiters were on top of  keeping drinks and food fresh.  We could not have asked for a better experience.

Our family has been a fan of Monit's for about 40 years now.  The last few times we went there I had been less than impressed with the service and food.  They have made some changes evidently because this last experience was much better.  Although the menu prices have gone up, the quality and service have improved dramatically over previous visits.  The place looked like it had undergone some renovations and looked cleaner and fresher.  Service was pretty quick and the food all done to perfection.  Their rosemary bread is always awesome and we were all impressed.  We will always be fans, but it was a nice improvement and glad to see it back to where it had been years ago.

We've been coming here for years but this last trip was just disappointing. We had a large party (and we called ahead since there were 15 of us.) They basically sat us in the isle to the bathrooms and kitchen.  The poor waiters kept bumping into our chairs to get past us. And the people seated in the booths on the other side of us had to wait for us to stand up so they could get out since it was so tight.  I asked for a drink menu and was told they were revamping it and there wasn't one available, so asked a couple of questions and ordered something.  Didn't receive what I ordered but our waiter was new so figured oh well.  He was also very slow in getting back to us so I got tired of waiting.  Got the bill and the drink was $9.  For a drink...that wasn't what I ordered and had not been told a price on.  Yes, I should have asked. Learn the hard way I guess.  99 cent Margarita would have been better. Service was very slow, food was mediocre at best. Prices seemed very high for the quality of food. Staff was friendly thank goodness.

We made a reservation online.  Arrived and we were seated right away.  That's where the good service ended.  The service was very poor and super slow.  My husband ordered a glass of wine when the waiter finally arrived to take our drink order.  His took 15 minutes to arrive and when they did bring his I decided to get one also.  It took 30 minutes for my glass of wine to arrive!  55 minutes for food.  Were never asked if we wanted a refill and had to flag down the waiter for more water.  No one ever came back to ask if everything was ok, how was the food, did we need anything.  Food was decent, not spectacular but it took almost 90 minutes for two people to have dinner.  Although the food was ok the whole experience was pretty poor.  Not sure if we will ever go back.

We had dinner there for my husband's birthday last week.  This is at least the third time we have been there that I was unable to get a prime rib rare or med. rare.  How can a steak joint not have rare prime rib before 6pm on a Wed?  Waitress didn't have to check, she knew they were out.  I ordered chicken fried steak instead and it was so salty I couldn't even eat half of it.  They tout themselves as a steak place, but don't seem to know how to actually cook steaks. Service was slow, and if I have my way we won't be back.

We had our 25th class reunion here and I must say I was extremely disappointed in their service and food.  They were not ready when we arrived to decorate 2 hours before the start.  The tables were filthy and when we said something about it they handed us rags.  We had planned a layout for the tables and nothing had been done.  We had to move most of the furniture ourselves as there was only one guy there helping for the first hour.  Half of the light bulbs on the patio were burned out. The floors were disgusting with food under the tables, pens and trash all over. The appetizers we had preordered were supposed to start being served at 6pm and nothing came out of the kitchen until after 7pm.  Then they were few and far between and some of them were not very good. We had planned food for 100 people and there is no way that much food ever made it to the guests.  All in all I was very disappointed the only nice things were the decor and setting and reconnecting with old friends.

Good food, great customer service.  Always a great time.  The owner, Randy definitely knows what customer service is all about.  Hot dogs are good, breakfast is awesome.  Helps if you are a Steeler's fan but even if you aren't you can't beat the food and fun!

Was referred to this office by my PCP for kidney stones.  I was only experiencing minor discomfort.  I was informed I needed surgery to remove a stone and a stent placed.  Surgery was scheduled for a couple of weeks out.  The day of the outpatient surgery my husband called the surgery center once and Sunrise Urology twice during normal business hours as I began experiencing extreme pain, flushed face, hot and cold flashes, fever and nausea almost immediately upon returning home after surgery.  I finally got a return phone call from Dr. Lin 22 hours later. I have a very high pain tolerance normally. I was still in extreme pain and was told "sometimes that happens" and given a prescription for bladder spasms.  That did not help.  No follow up after that.  I then returned to the office a week later to have the stent removed.  I voiced concerns to the assistant at that time about pain due to what I had experienced before.  I was told this should be "easy" and maybe a little pinch is what most people experience.  The removal was rather painful and Dr. Lin stated I might feel a "little cramping over the next 48 hours." He also invited me to visit his church for Easter while I was still undressed and he was holding the stent he had just removed. I left the office feeling uncomfortable both physically and emotionally. I took some Motrin as soon as I got home but within an hour of the removal the pain was so intense I could barely breathe.  I felt as if someone had hit me in the back with a baseball bat.  I then took the prescription Dr. Lin had given me after the initial surgery and it had no effect on the pain level. I again started with chills, hot flashes and throwing up. I called my husband to come home from work early and he took me to the ER.  They were able to do an IV to get the pain and nausea under control.  The ER also gave me a stronger pain pill as the doctor there said that what Dr. Lin had given me "might as well have been Chiclets."   Although I realize that not everyone has the same experience, the lack of compassion and follow up from this office is not acceptable to me.  (I still don't have the biopsy results as of this posting 9 days post op.) I will not be returning for any additional visits.

Love this place!  Found it through a coupon in the ValPak and was so impressed with the customer service that I forgot to use the coupon! Clean place and the tech did a great job but the customer service was over the top awesome.  They were professional, friendly and joked with everyone like they/we were best friends. No pressure sales, no rushing, wonderful treatment and services.  Won't go anywhere else now and I can't say enough good things about this place.

Food was great and happy hour prices were very good too.  Service was a little slow once we got our food.  Never did get asked if we needed a drink refill.  Waiter was nice, just seemed like he had too much to do and was rushing around a lot.

We have been in for lunch many times working in Downtown Chandler and it has always been very good.  Decided to try it for dinner with my husband.  Food was absolutely amazing.   Hubby had the tenderloin and I had the Rib-eye.  Both were done to perfection and the sides were wonderful as well.  Portion sizes were generous without being massive. We both had a glass of wine and the wine list is pretty good if a bit pricey.  The ambiance and decor are outstanding.  The only reason I did not give it five stars was the fact that the waiter who has served me at least 10 times for lunch didn't even begin to recognize me and asked if we had ever been there before, he was also a little on the slow side for refills. There was no bread either which we thought odd.

Had lunch here today.   My buffalo chicken wrap was good and my husband's burger was outstanding.   I tried it too and it was the best burger I've tasted in a long time.  Healthier sides would be a nice addition. Staff is friendly and attentive. I'm a country music fan so loved that too. Great experience.

Picked up two pumpkin and one apple hand pie at the Chandler Farmers Market on Thursday.  Oh my goodness are they good.  The pumpkin was good, not too sweet and filled with fresh pumpkin, not canned.  The apple was amazing and I'm a picky person when it comes to fresh apple desserts.  Yummy.  Definitely my new favorite.

We've been using Speedy's for several years now. My husband is pretty handy and can do most things himself.  Once they didn't have the part on hand we needed so they told him what he needed and where to get is so he could do it himself.  We are constantly amazed by their customer service.  We've never felt taken advantage of and know that what they tell us is the truth.  My husband checks parts prices and they are always reasonable.  They've never tried to "up sell" us on anything, just give us honest answers and help.  Their pricing is very competitive and if you want someone you can trust, call Speedy's!

We went for a girls, team building day.  One of the best pedicures I've ever had.  Relaxing environment, great service, beautiful pedicure and overall just a wonderful experience.  Highly recommend them if you want personalized service.
