Great coffee & lunch spot with amazing homemade baked goods, soups and sandwiches (and occasionally the best Mac & Cheese I've had). I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't comment on the coffee, but my coworker raves about it.  Lisa (owner) is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about coffee, and it shows in the care she takes with every aspect of the shop.  Lisa and her staff are friendly and make you feel at home. Local artists' work on display and free Wi-Fi available.

My son and I happened upon Drawn To Comics while visiting downtown Glendale last week.  The staff was very friendly and greeted us as we went in the store.  The store itself was very comfortable and was packed with not only comics, but toys, collectibles, clothing and even had a nice upstairs gaming room.  The knowledgeable staff took the time to ask us what we were interested in seeing, and helped us find a few books.  The owner was very friendly and even though we only bought a few books took the time to introduce himself when he checked us out.  Even though I don't live in Glendale I will go out of my way to shop at Drawn To Comics again.  Highly recommended.

I've been coming to First Watch's various Phoenix locations for years.  I've consistently had positive dining experiences each time.   I brought my family to the Scottsdale Promenade location on a busy Saturday morning for breakfast.  We were seated by a friendly host after a short wait (we were told 15 minutes and were seated in 10 minutes).  The server was attentive and friendly.  The food (as always) is fresh, served quickly and delicious.  The First Watch Potatoes are delicious.  Besides traditional eggs, pancakes and omelettes, there are a variety of dining options (wraps, salads, sandwiches) for brunch and lunch.

My first visit to the Grind was a 7pm dinner on a sunday with my 11 year old son.  We're pretty regular visitors to Delux Burger, but we've been hearing about the Grind for a while and thought we'd try it out for a change.  There were many people eating and drinking at the bar watching various games on the flat panels, but there was no wait to get a table.  In my experience staff at some of the other trendier restaurants around town tend to be a bit cool toward patrons with kids, but everyone at the Grind was accommodating and friendly to my son.  Our server took time to answer our questions about the burgers and made recommendations for us.  My son ordered a basic burger and I had the Steakhouse BLT Burger.    The burgers were HUGE, the meat was very flavorful, both were cooked to perfection, and the presentation was top notch.  We also shared an order of the herbed fries which were a nice compliment to the burger.  Not the best fries I've had, but good enough.  All in all a very positive first experience at the Grind.  Highly recommended for a great burger in a cool atmosphere.

The donut...  Arguably the best of all breakfast pastries, if not the best of all breakfast foods.  In this reviewer's opinion, Rainbow Donuts makes some of the best donuts in Phoenix.    Their donuts are light and crispy and taste like they were made from scratch instead of culled from a 100lb bag of "donut mix" like the big chains.  Highly recommended.

Ingo's has quickly become one of my favorite spots for a quick lunch or dinner. The simple menu has something for everyone. Ingo's Cheeseburger is fast becoming my favorite burger, the Crispy Chicken Sammy is delicious and the Shattered Potato Chips are amazing.  For a small patio restaurant with limited space I've never had trouble getting a seat. The service is always friendly and the atmosphere is fun and inviting. Highly recommended.

I have been to Joyride a handful of times, and while the food was always pretty good. The service (as you can read in plenty of other reviews here) is somewhat less than ideal. I never know who my server is or who will receive my tip.  I'm willing to overlook the wonky service for decent food and a fun atmosphere - however, I can't overlook food poisoning.    The last time I went to  Joyride I got food poisoning from the chicken tacos (I was the only one at my table who had the chicken, and I was the only one who got sick). I emailed Joyride as well as Upward Projects - explaining what happened in hopes that nobody else gets sick - but my emails were ignored. I expected more professionalism from Upward Projects. I have always had great luck at their other restaurants, but after this experience I won't be returning to Joyride.
