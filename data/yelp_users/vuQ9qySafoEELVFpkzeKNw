I really was so disappointed in this place. I was excited to eat here because of all the ratings. Maybe I'm spoiled in California but the sushi rolles here are bland and tasteless.  What a waste of my money. If this is one of the best in the area all I have to say is you have my condolences.

I usually don't like to write negative reviews but warning DO NOT rent from here! The cars are given filthy dirty!! I don't know who the guy was that I tried to check  the car in with,  but he was so rude!!! He asked me if I wrote down the millage and I explained to him that  I didn't realize that I had to do that, he then rudely told me "well if you want to check out I suggest you go back and do it! And by the way if the car is dirty you will have to pay a $250.00 cleaning fee!" I couldn't belive how rude this guy was! I love budget and Avis but these guys who own this franchise need to check who their employees are. I always rent from Avis and Budget because they are usually a classy organization but if they continue to allow franchises to guys like these I'll take my business elsewhere! At first I  met the owner and he seemed to be a nice guy but after my check in experience I don't know what to say!  My suspicions tell me this looser guy is a relative who's hurting this business.
