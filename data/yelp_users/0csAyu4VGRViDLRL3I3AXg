Great pizza for a killer price, 2 slices and a drink for only 5.32! So much good pizza for about what you would pay at slices if not less! If you go to McClintock High School or are in the area don't pass this up!

fantastic coffee and sandwich shop, great atmosphere, excellent service, a little slow but well worth it for their incredible toasted sandwhiches!

Best pizza I've had in Tempe, brick oven and thin, most authentic pizza I've had in the valley, Incredibly tasty, more 'date night' then 'order out' because of the high price, about $16 for a 12" (only size available), all the pizza is cooked by this one awesome Bosnian dude who makes all of the pizza, if you have ever tried the pizza over in Europe you will love this place

Pretty mediocre bbq, not bad, just not "great" the way barbecue should be! I would say it was on par with honey bears, but I really enjoy the bbq sauce they used on my pulled pork sandwich. It was pretty expensive, my friends fish and chips turned out to $8-9 with a drink, geez. I think there are plenty of better alternatives like AZ bbq co or joe's real bbq, or if you need something in the area you can't go wrong with somme burros right next door.

So many great locations in Vegas it seems like a shame to waste your money here. I come here for conferences and always dread the half our trek it takes to get anywhere within the hotel (especially from room to conference center). Most of the hotel feels outdate, I'm not sure they're doing anything to restore the rooms and hotel. A better slogan for MGM would be "There's a charge for thtat". Charge for storing your personal belongings in the mini-fridge, charge for using the pool, resort fees. Customer support and their mobile site are also pretty useless.  EDIT. Came back from the strip to find all my personal belongings missing from my room. Took two hours for staff to track them down and then acted like I was crazy for misplacing my belongings. Thanks MGM, very classy.

Have only had a couple chances to visit Bunna Coffee even though it's ridiculously close to my house because I am usually in downtown Tempe for work. I have had the pleasure of visiting here twice, once for an interview and once to catch up on some work. Both times I just grabbed an ice coffee but was impressed on both occasions, although this place is no Lux Coffeebar or Cartel Coffee Lab, this hip little joint has a fine brew. Since then I have fallen in love with the cozy warmth of the cafe, with the IKEA furniture and bright and sunny colors. I will indeed make it a point to visit this place again as soon as I get another chance.  EDIT: I would visit %100 more if they were open for more than an hour every day.

I'm a huge tea drinker but it's hard to find any tea cafe's Tempe, unfortunately it's nowhere near where I work otherwise I would stop by religiously. From the two times that I have been there I've gotten iced green tea's cannot remember what blend but they we're both really good. Great service and staff was very friendly and helpful and free wifi is always a plus. I really hope they expand across the valley so I can visit them more often. :D

Incredible coffee, on the same level as LUX coffee bar and perfect for people closer to the Tempe area. Go to LUX for the atmosphere and cartel for the coffee and make sure and try the Iced Toddy it was incredible!

One of my favorite coffee houses, a real treat, one of the best places to study and meet with friends, most of the time it's pretty quite besides the neighboring businesses that are both open to this little coffee shop, and did I say little? I mean pretty small, but every time I have gone there has been plenty of good seating. Most of their drinks are definitely worth staying for, their large is served in a glass the size of a beer mug. The iced coffee and mocha are both excellent, and ridiculously good for the money. I really love the vibe of this place, great music, arcade fire, snow patrol, adele, can't wait to start studying here more often as the school season picks-up.

The Cup O' Karma is such a neat coffee shop, it has a lot of character and flair and a great iced coffee.

This place if full of win! A great place to connect with some amazing people who have a huge passion for the web and technology community in phoenix. You can drop by any weekday to get work done on some well put together Swedish desks with plenty of power strips for all your electronic need and of course free wifi. There is also sweet tunes always playing on the gangplank speaker system! Next time you think you need to go to Starbucks to get work done, why not try coming to gangplank instead.  Make sure and show up on Wednesdays during lunch to see some awesome speakers talk about pretty much anything related to the web community in phoenix. Or show up on Wednesday nights to hang and eat pizza with some great techy peeps from all over Phoenix!

Your clever double entendre of a name won't win me over "daily grind," if that is your real name. Honestly, there are so many excellent coffee and tea shops in the valley that it would be a waste to settle for this.

Went to Cherubini to meet up with a friend, this place is pretty large for just a coffee and donuts shop, the indoor water fountain does seem a bit much, but it is a fantastic meeting location for discipleship or business. Great atmosphere, sweet soundtrack, helpful and caring staff. The glazed donut I ordered was pretty good, especially compared to the other limited options in Tempe, it's hard to find good donuts in Tempe now that krispy kreme has moved away. Until they come back, this is definitely my new favorite place for good donuts and coffee. I wasn't all that impressed with their regular brewed coffee (you figure traditional coffee and donuts, should be great right?) I had much better luck with their ice coffee the next time I went, which was pretty sweet without anything extra, and went along great with my chocolate glazed donut. Definitely check it out if you are in the area, if your not a donut fan and your just looking for some caffeine i'd recommend Solo or Cartel for better atmosphere and beans. (also friend reccomended the breakfast sandwhich!) Cheers.

Staff are really friendly, great music, vibe and absolutely incredible decor. Haven't been impressed with their coffee (drip, iced, latte). Will have to try some of their food items next time I'm in.
