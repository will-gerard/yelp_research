At least the US Airways terminal (which might be the whole airport, i'm not sure) is awesome.  It is bright with real sunlight when possible with large windows and wonderful little rocking chairs to hang out on.    They have a Chili's there right in the middle which is always a favorite with me, especially at the end of a long trip. Who can say no to chips and salsa? AND a beer?  I didn't think so.  It is super easy to get around the airport and while it is a spread out, it goes pretty quick.  I think they have free wi-fi too, and pretty good shopping if you left something at home.

Who knew Fort Mill could boast such a cute little coffee/lunch/wine spot?  I was brought here by some collegues for lunch since I was in town to visit HQ.  Not really excited about the lunch options based on my last trips, I was glad to see they branched out to find this place.    I think the guy behind the register was having a bad day....we had to repeat our order a couple of times.  And even though he asked if I said Regular or Diet coke, and I answered "diet" - I was handed a regular coke.  No biggie - I have a day like that all the time, and at least he was nice about it.  My lunch was the goat cheese salad - what I failed to realize was that the goat cheese was fried.  EVEN BETTER!  It was a delicious salad and something I would definitely look forward to ordering again next time I am in Fort Mill.

Karsh's Bakery has been around forever - with that kind of staying power, you would expect great things when you walk through the door.  How else did they make it so long here?  Well, I don't have an answer for you.  After a recent visit, I still have no idea.  The place felt very sterile and there was a lack of personality behind the counter.  Perhaps that is because there was a lack of confectionary wonderment in the bakery cases.  Sure they had basic cookies and cakes, and some sweet breads, but Momma L and I were hard pressed to find a special birthday treat for her.    It could be the curse of an afternoon visit that could be blamed for the lack of variety, but they did seem to have plenty of cookies left.  And their cakes looked amazing but there was only the option to purchase a whole cake.  I'm sure they do quite a bit of catering and it could be well worth it for a special cake order. But for the occasional visit as a special treat for the eyes and tastebuds, this was not the place.  We did purchase an 2 eclairs - since that was the most exciting option - and can't say that it was a memorable birthday dessert that night.

As good as it gets, for dive bars, of course.  Pomeroy's truly is the best of the worst.  It has all the comforts of a great dive bar:  windowless, dirty, surly bartenders, cheap drinks, greasy food, and a handful of regulars. You can come as you are and fit right in or throw on some clean clothes and be one of the better looking people in the bar.    The place smells much better than it ever used to, thanks to the "no smoking inside" ban a few years back.  But it still is pretty nasty...in a good way. Watch yourself in the bathrooms though...  Shuffleboard, pool tables, people watching, and cheap eats and drinks are all in store for those brave enough to hang at Pommies.  They even have darts, fooseball, and a small respectable arcade that boasts Deer Hunter.    As far as food goes, it is the quintessential bar food.  Served on paper plates...just like you have at home.  The burger and chili cheese fries are my favorites and the beers are ice cold.   A good casual place to just hang out - Pomeroy's holds a special place in my heart and always delivers a good time.  Sometimes a headache too, but that kicks in the next day.

Oh man.  Where do I start with this place?  I absolutely love it.  The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because it has a devastating effect on your waistline with frequent visits.  A look around at your fellow diners will confirm the fate that you too will suffer if you don't mend your gluttonous CO ways.  Eat in moderation - especially here.  Then again, that really shouldn't deter you from stopping in. Especially if it is your birthday - because this is THE PLACE FOR BIRTHDAYS!  Every single time, without fail, and more predictable than the US Mail - someone is celebrating their birthday.  When I would go often, it was understandable.  But now that I go much less frequently (for reasons stated above - yes I fell victim to it), it is amazing.  My 2x a year visit, and it happens to be someone's birthday.  I wish I had those odds with the lottery.    They have some of the best chip's and salsa in town and great beers, both in the bottle and on tap.  And they just keep 'em coming....free of charge, like it should be.   My favorite sunday afternoon past time would be hanging at the bar, drinking XX Lager, and consuming mountains of chips.  The burritos are excellent to - although I tend to stick to the bean burrito with enchilada style (with red sauce) since it does well left over.  And trust me, leave some food on your plate.  Or suffer the consequences (see above).  Cheese Crisps, Nachos, Fajitas and tacos are pretty tasty.  Everything is smothered in cheese, beans, and rice and served on hot colorful plates...just like comfort mexican food should be.  I have never been disappointed with any visit to CO, well, except the time I found out they stopped serving the  choc-star-lite mints after dinner.  That was a real downer.

I am a fan of PHX - and why not? It is my home town airport.   Your experience will really depend on which terminal you fly out of - which most of my adult life has been terminal 4.  But I remember as a kid, Terminal 2 was pretty cosmopolitan and the short term parking was just across the street.    Terminal 4 is lacking in the food/amenities department, but they are working on it.  The best experience is on the concourse, before the security gates.  But if you didn't know and headed to your gate, you still have a few options, but you can't be picky.    My favorite is Blue Burrito - located near A26 side of the terminal. And there are plenty are Sbux around, however, pay attention to your bill.  I've been overcharged before.  On my last visit, terminal 4 is getting a Modern Burger and Blanco Y Tequila spot...which is super cool.  They are both owned by the Fox chain of restaurants, so they are nothing uber unique, but he does have a knack for coming up with cool concepts to lure you in.  And spend your money.  So there is that to look forward too :)  There is free wifi and the security lines can be short...but when they aren't the TSA really stinks at managing them.  But how is that different from any other airport?    If you do end up in PHX ....the best experience to be had is outside of the airport.  And looking out of all the windows in Terminal 4 you can see all sides of the valley and the beautiful mountains you could be climbing.

If/When I make it back to the magical Summerlin suburb, we will definitely be back to this little gem!  First of all, if you can find it through the maze of neighborhoods and suburb distractions, the Marche Bacchus is nestled in some corporate retail plaza and boasts the most amazing patio....EVER!  This patio is completely all weather....and on this particular night, it was a little chilly, but you never would have known it.  We were seated by the fire, and almost roasting in our seats. But they were happy to turn it down for us when we asked.  Which brings me to the service:                                                            AWESOME!  Joe was super nice and to the Beau's surprise, a beer connoisseur.  I swear, I saw his face light up when the Beau asked him what beers they had available.  Joe recommended an amazing beer that he just loved, and now we have to find here in MPLS.  But otherwise, he was excellent, attentive and talkative.  The only downside, I would say, would be that when I ordered a couple of reserve wines, he didn't ask me what size.  I thought one was the glass, and the other was the bottle, so I was thinking that what I ordered was the glass size.  What I got was the most expensive glass of wine....ever.  That kind of stunk, but they were super good wines.  The Beau ordered Steak Frites and I had the Warm Spinach Salad appetizer with the Sea Scallop appetizer for dinner.  I have no idea how to make Chorizo vinaigrette, but I was blown away by this salad.  And the scallops were amazing.  The beau loved his dinner too and  I was lucky he was willing to share.  Their fries were delicious and the steak was perfectly done.    Their wine store is awesome, although we didn't really look at much.  I hear you can purchase your wine and drink it with dinner - which is completely awesome.  And according to Joe, you can catch the owner on an episode of Pawn Stars!  He was the expert brought in to identify an original bottle of Dom Champagne.    This is definitely a place I would recommend to anyone who wants something completely off the strip, quiet, casual, but also sophisticated and intimate.  The Beau and I had an amazing time and agreed, this was the highlight of our trip.  Great atmosphere combined with great food and EXCELLENT service, this was definitely our favorite.  Thanks to all the local Las Vegas Yelpers that clued us in.  Oh....and it is true about the bread pudding. It is a MUST when you go.

It makes me sad to see that so many people are surprised that Phoenix has an art museum, let along a good one.   Why wouldn't we have great places where you can just wander around looking at stuff all day in the air-conditioning?  Did you think we only offered malls for that?  That being said, the Phoenix Art Museum has really done a nice job of making it interesting for those of us escaping the heat.  They have some great installations (the firefly one is a must!) and some amazing paintings by artists that you likely know.    Often, they also showcase some regional collections (cowboy/western exhibit) or offer exhibits featuring some historical AZ reference - currently running is the Frank Lloyd Wright exhibit & Historical AZ photography exhibit.  Those are what you keep you coming back.  The sculpture garden is awesome too when the weather is nice.  The restaurant onsite also boasts local foods, wines & beers which is an awesome experience for both natives and tourists alike.  Most of us from here are clueless to the what AZ can really bring to the table, literally.  The Museum sits on what was once the Phoenix Public Library and Phoenix Children's theater.  I have fond memories of the card catalogs and microfilm adventures there after school.  And on the weekends, Grandma would bring us the children's theater for a shows put on by The Cookie Company.  The best part were the Oreo cookies and carton of milk they handed out after the show (not just a clever name).  Some of my favorite memories - thanks for letting me share.

Let's just start by saying that anything that is considered "Fashionable" always seems to have an element of questionable functionality.    Biltmore Fashion Park is just that - a fashionable park in the biltmore area.  With upscale retail stores and pricey boutiques, it is just the right blend to make us 99% feel fashionable.  After valet parking, we can pick up our new Apple products, walk around the park swinging our sleek bag and then stop for a drink on the patio of one of the upscale dining options.  Even bring our canine accessory for the day and watch movies in the evening.  I love it! The restaurants are awesome (even if Sam Fox has a stranglehold on most of it now), but Christopher's Crush Lounge is not to be forgotten in the back corner either.  When they have movies in the park, definitely get there early for a great lawn seat.  Parking is a bit of a nightmare, but avoid the south side completely for a more pleasant experience.  Going in the "back way" is a much better option although less visually appealing.  The Biltmore Fashion Park has been an institution at this corner - hosting the likes of Planet Hollywood, Coffee Plantation, Sharper Image, and many other greats of their time.  Glad to see it is still around and kicking!

Somethings just don't change....Costco will always be Price Club to me, and Piestewa Peak will always be Squaw Peak.    The Phoenix Mountain Preserves, which is home to Squaw Peak, is an amazing preserve smack in the middle of a metropolis.  The well known Summit Trail is heavily traveled and well loved by regulars and visitors alike. It is a strenuous hike and is most challenging near the top.  Stair like rocks lead you to the summit - but watch your step and be very careful as there are few handrails.  Parking is always a problem, especially on the weekend as everyone wants to get out and enjoy the outdoors.  If the first two lots are full, keep going as there are more opportunities to park further north.  And what is an extra few minutes of walking when your planning on hiking 2.4 miles roundtrip anyways?  Be sure to check out the other trails - like the Circumference Trail that starts at the north parking lot and circles the preserves, linking up with the Summit Trail near the end - giving you the option to continue to the peak.  There are parts of this trail that are secluded and make you forget that you are in the middle of Phoenix.  Dogs are allowed on almost all the trails except the Summit, so it is great fun for your pup.  Just be sure to keep them safe from the cactus and bring plenty of water.  I highly recommend this hike and be safe!

To be completely honest, I'm a fan of practically every Marriott hotel.  I feel that I should disclose this - and the fact that as an elite member, it is even better!  You should sign up.  This was a "reward" trip to escape MPLS for a bit and soak up some sun and Vitamin D.  What I love about using my points to book stays with Marriott, is they don't treat you any different.  I was still upgraded to a room with an amazing view of the strip.  And that was about as close as we wanted to get the "real" Vegas. The mission for our trip was to lay out, relax and just enjoy doing nothing for a couple of days.  Do a little hiking, get a massage, eat, fall asleep in the sun - that was all I had planned.  Located only 15 minutes from Red Rock Canyon and 30 minutes from the strip, this was an ideal location.  Free parking too, so that is even better since you definitely need a car.  The hotel was beautiful and a touch on the older side, but our room has a sweet jacuzzi bath tub!   My first sign regarding the overall population of the hotel should have been the phone in the bathroom.  In my experience, this is only present when the hotel appeals to the older crowd.  Nonetheless, I had fun making phone calls from the bathroom the entire weekend. Families and Grandparents.  That is pretty much it around here.  Not a terrible thing, but it would help create a better atmosphere in the evening hours after 8pm :)  The casino and the buffet is where you could find most of the blue-hairs.  Drinking, Gambling and smoking - but not in a cool way.  Overall, I really loved the hotel and would definitely come back for the same type of vacation.  However, I would plan on leaving the hotel at night to check out some neighborhood spots.

Pretty cool atmosphere here - although a few more families than I expected to see here, since it gives off that upscale casual feel.  My parents would never have spent that kind of money on my 6yr old palette and attitude.  But hey, maybe times have changed.    Anyways, I was in town for work and staying close by so this was one of the many options around the SouthPark area.  And if you are in the mood for some steak, you should definitely stop in.   I started a salad so loaded down with bacon that it might have well been named "plate of bacon bits with lettuce".  Which I'm not complaining - it was darn good.  I love bacon.  And when my steak arrived, I loved that too.  Tender and juicy but a little cool.  And yes, I ordered it rare but only the center should be cool.  Not the outside. I'm not going to dock points for that since during this particular trip to the Charlotte/Fort Mill area, I was served plenty of cool food.  Maybe it is regional thing?  The woodfire they have going in plain view of the restaurant is awesome -and smells soooooo good.  I would definitely be back here on another trip to the area!

Our retreat from the walkers and blue-hairs that surrounded us in the Casino.  We had no idea that we would be the only people between the ages of 21 and 60 in the hotel/casino.  We had an absolute blast here! They do have live music and the band was great.  We ordered some bar food - potato skins and chicken fingers - and they were just a greasy and delicious as I hoped.    And to my surprise, they make awesome cocktails.  The best sidecar I have had to date! I was glad we found this place, it definitely made our night.

We stumbled upon this place while we vacationed in beauty Summerlin - Las Vegas that is.    Right away I loved the decor and the giant fireplace in the bar.  The Staff is amazing and efficient.  Firefly reminded me how much I do love tapas - 2 nights in a row.  The bar is great and comfortable with plenty of high tops, but they also boast a large heated patio.  Any tapas place worth it's weight should have outstanding Sangria in both varieties - and Firefly delivers.  My favorite was the sparkling White Sangria - it was refreshing, fruity and superb.  As for the small plates, we sampled the following: Tierra Y Mar Skewers - the sausage is the most outstanding tidbit. Empanada - 2x because just one a piece wasn't enough. Meatballs - or Albondigas as they call them. Veggie Empanada - delicious, and just as good as the pork.  Maybe better!  I sure do wish there was one of these nearby me!

Nice little pool side hangout that is part of the J.W. Marriott Resort here in Summerlin. They have a nice selection of cocktails and the requisite bucket of beers for those special occasions.  Our sweet little server was honest enough to tell us that she had no idea what the "Senorita Maria" cocktail was, or what was in it.  In fact, she guessed that even the bartender didn't know because no one had ever ordered it. I shall be the first. then and explore the unexplored.  Patron silver on the rocks, lime juice, garnished with a wedge of lime and a salted rim. I call it the "Senorita Kate", and it is sure to get the job done. And compared the the regular margarita that the Beau ordered, mine was WAY better.    Enjoy!

What a great addition to the neighboorhood!  A great covered patio with games, live music, great food and a central location.  I had the opportunity to visit the Yard twice in the same day.  And the experiences were night and day.  Come to think of it, those are the 2 times I was there...once for lunch and then later to meet up with friends for drinks and music.  The lunch scene was not idea.  Service was a little spotty - we did have to ask for things a couple of times.  But also the noise level was completely unbearable.  When my mom complained about it on her visit, I thought that was just her age talking (imagine a cranky lady shaking her fist at the kiddos - "turn that loud mess off").    With the busy street on one side and live band that answered back with a higher volume, sound waves bounced chaotically off every inche of the patio - the place is nothing but hard surfaces.  I was literally screaming at my lunch companion as well as the waitress.  I was also in a volume battle with the noisy kids seated just a foot away from us.  Oh yes, there are children there too.  As I left, with a sore throat and ringing in my ears, I decided this was not a place to return.  However, when friends picked the yard later that night, I realized that wouldn't last.  And it was still loud.  But that seems more acceptable when it is after 10pm...however, I was struggling to continue to yell at my companions and listen carefully with my ear in their face to hear them.  So that was my major take away from my 6 hours at the Yard.  Loud.  In fact, I can still hear it ringing in my ears.
