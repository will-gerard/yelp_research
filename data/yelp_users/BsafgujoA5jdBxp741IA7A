My favorite car wash place in Glendale. Prices are not bad and they have great customer service. The waiting room is huge with a lot of snacks and drinks so that's a plus. I usually go in the morning (before 10) and the wait is about 30 min. I believe they have early bird specials too. Check their website for coupons as well ($2 off).

Trendy and fun spot to eat and drink. Everything is so good at Fez for any time of the day. I was pretty surprised by how differently delicious the salads were...I mean, come on, when are salads ever worth paying for at a restaurant. Definitely worth it here.  They always have great daily drink specials, and the waiters have always been amazing.

I've only tried the macaroons and chocolate croissant. I was really excited after reading all the good reviews but they were average and a little pricey for what they are. I wouldn't recommend.

Everything is so good here, my favorite is the salmon though, and the portions are surprisingly filling. They have a great beer selection too. If you want to try something new, try the scotch egg.  It's located in a plaza so lots of parking available.

This place is so good for satisfying a burger craving. The meat has always been juicy and vegetables are fresh. The shoestring fries are the best though. The desserts/sundaes are okay, not too remarkable.

I could probably write a 5-page paper about how much I love The Root Salon.   After much research, I booked both my consultation (free!) and appointment online with Emily Claire. I have black hair and wanted blue/teal, but was afraid it was going to come out tacky. In the end, Emily C gave me EXACTLY what I wanted even when I didn't even know this was what I wanted, so I'm pretty sure she can read minds and look into your soul (in a non-creepy way of course). She is so professional and made the whole process so comfortable. She's the best, and that's an understatement.  What I noticed the most is that the salon is one big family. Every one in the team seems to be extremely knowledgeable and beyond talented all the while helping each other out. That's pretty rare to see, so you'll be in good hands with whoever you're with.   Also, the salon is very decently priced. I'm a student, and Emily Claire totally worked with me and made little tweaks here and there to help me out.

I wish I could give this hotel 0 stars. My nice flip flops were stolen directly from my hotel room. Seriously...? Flip flops?   We stayed at this hotel because we came to check out some property nearby. Checked in around 5:30, went to dinner at 6 downstairs at the Big Sur and got back to the room around 8pm to find that my brand name sandals were gone. I only brought two pairs of shoes, and I distinctly remember carrying them up with my luggage and placing them down next to the bed, so it was obvious that someone had taken them.   I called the front desk. They sent up the head maid who checked the room, then they sent up a police officer so I could file a report. The police officer had some device that could tell who else came into the room, but he said it would take some time (not surprised), blahblahblah. I wasn't really expecting them to do much, but still. It was unsettling to know that someone would just come into the room and steal something. This is the first time I didn't stay at a hotel on the strip, and this is the first time something like this has happened out of the countless times I've been to Vegas...actually out of the times I've stayed at any hotel.   Long story short, the maid service or whoever else has keys to the rooms steal your stuff because they KNOW that the hotel/police don't care. Free cute flip flops for everyone!  Don't stay here.

I went with two others and ordered the oysters, calamari and linguini with clams and red sauce. Portions are well-sized. The oysters weren't amazingly fresh, but they were on the larger size and not bad. The calamari was average. I highly recommend the linguini! The sauce was savory and broth-y, and the calms were fresh.   Service was great. Our waiter Alfredo was really friendly and very attentive to our needs. It's a small restaurant in the South Point hotel, but we went on a weekday night and there was no wait to sit at the bar. The place seems pretty popular so I would imagine there would be a wait on the weekends.   There are great lunch specials ($7.95?) with half off oysters and calms.

The quality of food has gone WAY down.  The calamari was pretty much just small fried batter pieces. I'm pretty sure the Cesar salad lettuce was just packaged lettuce because the color was dull greenish-yellow and just thrown into a pile on a plate. We also ordered the shrimp scampi, which was overall very average. The shrimp pieces however were large and pretty good.   But for the prices they charged, the food was bad. I get that the restaurant is in a hotel/casino, but it's not even a real restaurant considering the location and lack of walls.

Mall food sucks, but The Nordstrom Caf√©s are always reliable. The salad and panini we got were made in front of us and were amazing. Portions were generous as well. Service was great too, and we were given yummy mint chocolates at the end.

The food is consistent, staff is super chill. It's a great pick for settling your fried food craving.

EVERYTHING tastes amazing, and they have a great beer selection. Definitely get the scotch eggs and oven chips.

Picked up the nachos and carne asada tacos. Both were really good! Didn't try the red chile, but the green chile on the nachos was amazing. The tortilla chips themselves were amazing too.  If I'm in the area next time, I'll probably dine in since they have buffet style tortilla chips, salsa, cilantro, onions, etc.

Super cute coffee shop in a small plaza. Free wifi. A good number of single tables that you can work at inside and some tables outside under a shade too. Single, large and really clean bathrooms. They have a variety of flavored lattes you can choose from (albino monkey, honey boo boo, almond roca, white chocolate amaretto, and more). They also have soy milk AND almond milk! I got an iced Nutella latte with almond milk, SO GOOD. But sweet, so beware!

Located right off the freeway, this branch is easily accessible. I've been at most hours of the day, and lines haven't been too long (drive-thru). The iced lattes are amazing if you like really sweet coffee drinks, and the coffee isn't too harsh on the stomach.  Service is always friendly, which could be ehh sometimes if you don't feel too chatty at times. But they often give extra stamps, which is nice.

(Lots of street parking) Not a fan of most restaurants in Phoenix, but went for a friend's birthday upon his recommendation and was more than satisfied. The pizzas were amazing. When you typically order pizza with prosciutto at a restaurant, you get 1 (maybe 2) measly chopped up pieces. At Pomo, they are so generous, which makes the pizza even better. The cocktails were great and super cute themed (Ferrari, Vespa, Maserati, etc).  Our waiter and the owner were the best, so accommodating and personable. I will definitely be going back.

Such a cool place to munch on food with awesome cocktails! It's rare to find a place that know how to make a real caipirinha so I'm impressed. The food is innovative, but pretty average, even a bit too salty. Overall pricey, but worth it once in a while.  It's a little hard to find street parking, but there are some lots nearby so bring quarters/cash.

Went in around 8am on a Saturday. The line wasn't that long, about 5 min wait. I got a mixed dozen with a few specialty ones so they charged extra. I highly recommend the blueberry cake!  By the way, they also have a drive-thru!
