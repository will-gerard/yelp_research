I adore this complex. I have the biggest studio (basically a one bedroom, same sq ft) ever, and its so cute! The rent is a great price too, and the leasing office works with all kinds of credit. Easiest application process! Maintenance is AMAZING. I got locked out of my apartment on to my second floor balcony (the sliding door locked behind me when I closed it, yay) and I called the emergency line at 11 oclock at night. Left them a message, and someone was there to open my door within minutes. I've never lived at a complex where the emergency maintenance line really responds like they say they will.  Great insulation for an older complex and a second floor apartment, I usually keep my place at around 67 degrees but 72 in my apartment is FREEZING. Great for the summer bills! The only thing I would like is some updating, like darker cabinets and counters (theyre a light tan and pinkish tint) new appliances and a microwave, the studios apparently don't come with one. Renewing my lease. :)

Let me start of by saying that BJs is absolutely fantastic.  The roast beef au jous dip is orgasmic. It is literally an explosion of endorphins in your mouth. The meat is tender, med rare, and the au jous is overflowing with herbs and spices. Ladies, bring a towel with you, because the chair WILL be wet. I hope your men aren't jealous, because believe me, THIS meat will be the best meat you have ever put in your mouth. Each bite of this mouth-pleaser will go straight to your pants area.  Seriously. Roast beef dip. Do it

This place has the BEST wings of any place I've been to. Ever. I actually end up crazing their wings. It's a fun place to go to relax. Music isn't loud. There aren't obnoxious people. Karaoke on Saturdays! But what keeps me coming is the wings. Food food fooooood.

I've been coming here for over three years now. I will gladly drive the half hour one way trip it takes to get from my house to this place. I don't know how I would survive without them. Simple as that.

We came in at 12:30 on a Friday. The bartender, who was our server too, was pretty knowledgeable about her beers and drinks. We ordered a roast beef au jous dip, pear quesadilla and BBQ wings. The food was mediocre. The au jous was thin, the roast beef was pretty bland. The pear quesadilla was good, didn't have the oomph we were looking for. The wings were terrible. An odd flavored BBQ sauce, they weren't crispy. We didn't have a long wait for food or drinks though! That's good. And the waffle fries are great.  Overall, I'd probably only come back for drinks.

SO OVERPRICED.  The only reason I even considered giving it two stars was because I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. However;  The base oil change was $40. NOT including oil, which was an extra charge. I brought my car in with barely 129k miles, so I opted for the high mileage oil which was an additional $25. A $65 oil change is just asinine.  Plus to change the air filter they wanted $20. For what? Popping it out and slapping a clean one in? Please. I'll do that myself and save $15.

I've been going to Deanna since I stumbled upon the magic she creates about 3 to 4 years ago. She is absolutely incredible. Knowledgeable about ALL hair types, what you can and cant pull off (everyone needs a little honesty in their life) and she actually takes the time and effort to make sure that whatever it is she does to your hair, causes as little damage as physically possible, depending on the work she's doing. She really cares about the quality of her work, your hair, and the longevity of the style she does. And she's the fastest installer I've ever been to! Lightning hands, she has lightning hands. She has done my I-tip fusions and I have referred her to many people. I could stop wearing extensions completely and even 10 years from now, if someone needs to know the name of an excellent stylist, I will always save her phone number and pictures of her work to brag about her. She brings out the best in women and you don't know good hair until you've had Deanna give you your best hair.
