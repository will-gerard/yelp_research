Carolina's: My go-to mexican place, hands down. I have been to this place many times, and I will keep going back. My way of judging a Mexican food place is by the Tortilla. If they have a delicious, self-made, fresh tortilla, things are promising and that is exactly what Carolina's has. They have their awards on the wall for all the times they have been voted Best Tortilla in Phoenix, in case you don't wanna take my word for it.  On to the food. I absolutely LOVE the food here! I have yet to try anything here that I didn't love. The tacos don't come in these pre-shapen, dried out, hard shells like some other places. You can see some of the grease on it form the very recent deep-frying, and it is perfectly crisp without being dried out. The meet is always cooked perfectly. I have never ordered something and been disappointed by dried out meat. Some of my favorite things here are the chimichanga and hard-shell beef tacos, which is shredded beef, not the crappy ground junk that a lot of places use. The Chimichangas have to be my favorite, though. I have never had a chimichanga this great. Be careful, though, because the inside of it is REALLY HOT. You will burn yourself if you don't let it cool a little. I would love to talk about the taste of the food more, but I'm making myself too hungry, so I'll move on.  The best part about Carolina's is the price. You cannot beat the price for the quality of food you get. Tacos are all $0.75, all the time! I guarantee you will be filled up from tacos before you feel like you spent too much on them, and you won't be disappointed with the taste! I can't remember the exact price for the chimichangas, but I do remember that it is much less than you will pay anywhere else, and much more delicious!  The location isn't the best, but who cares. The best stuff is always hard to find! If you don't think it's in a safe area and that is what's deterring you, don't let it. There are cops in and out of there all the time to eat. Plus, nobody wants to pull any crap here because it's just too good!  EDIT: Tacos are not $0.75 anymore. I guess they are up to $2.00 now. New price is disappointing, but this doesn't change my rating because they are still the best tacos around!

I really enjoy going here for lunch. I had a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich on Jalapeno Cheese Bread and finished with some frozen yogurt topped with pieces of their delicious cookies. Both were delicious and the Froyo with Cookie pieces was a great finish. Its just a standard, small cafe, but the employees here have been extremely nice and friendly every single time I have gone. I have yet to have a bad experience. The price isn't terribly high, I would say on par with Paradise Bakery and the likes. They are known for their baked goods, but you should definitely try a sandwich on one of their specialty breads (like the Jalapeno Cheese that I mentioned above). Don't be deterred by the possibly long line at lunch time, it moves very quickly (at least it has everytime I have been in) and the sandwiches are usually brought to you about 5 minutes after you order. I would definitely recommend this to others as a great place for lunch.

The best way I can think of to describe Steve's Krazy Sub is that it is like Subway, but better in almost every way. They don't have as many bread choices, but the bread tastes better. Basically all of the ingredients taste better. The first time I went, I had the Poorboy, which was delicious. Second time, I had a Super Sub, also delicious. Next time I will probably get my Sandwiches without Mustard though, because it is a little overpowering. Can't forget the pickles, which are delicious!  My absolute favorite part about Krazy Sub is the prices. For comparison, Subway has a $6.00 Box lunch special, which only has a 6" sub, then you add on the tax. At Krazy Sub, You can get one of their lunch specials, which also has the drinks and chips, but with a FOOTLONG sub for $6.00 after tax! Suck it, Subway! Also, the subs are generally cheaper. The smallest size, their "mini", is an 8" sub and the prices are comparable, maybe cheaper, than Subway's 6" subs.   The people here are pretty friendly, but the owner is especially friendly. He always has a smile on his face and loves talking to the customers. When I was leaving, I almost drove away with my drink on top of my car (put it there while I put some stuff in the car and forgot about it) and he rushed outside to prevent me from spilling it all over and making a mess of my car. Thanks!  Anyways, I'm going back again for lunch today, and I suggest you try it out sometime. It's definitely one of the best deals around for food, especially at lunch.

Oh man, this is really one of those cases that I wish they had half stars. I really loved this place and wanted to give it the 5-star badge-of-awesome, but I can't bring myself to do that at a place where the food doesn't absolutely blow me away. Now, that isn't to say that the food wasn't great, it just wasn't that 5-star level that you have dreams about when you get home. None-the-less, I will be returning. This place uses organic, local, fresh ingredients for all their food. That is a rare find, my friends. The fresh, organic thing was the main reason I really wanted to give it a 5, but the flavors just didn't knock my socks off. I had the Gobble it Up Sandwich, a Chicken Waldorf salad, and Ginseng Soother smoothie. The sandwich, in my opinion, had one big thing going for it; the havarti cheese. I LOVE havarti cheese and not many places carry it. All in all, the food is good, but the only part that really wowed me me was the smoothie. It's labeled as their stress-reducer smoothie, so I thought I would give it a whirl seeing as a could use a little relaxation before heading back to work. I drank most of the smoothie before the food came, and I really did feel less stressed by then, but I'm not sure how much of that was due to the smoothie.  That brings us to the ambiance of the bungalow. It's a very quiet, peaceful place. The sitting areas are pulled off the street a little so you aren't right next to all the noise of the passing cars (not that there are many on that street anyway) and it has this cafe setup. No, not that Starbuck's always-on-speed-everyone-wants-to-kill-eachother-could-there-be-more-noise-in-here? cafe, but a cafe ambiance like they should be. It was quiet, free internet access, and very relaxed. Even the employees of the bungalow seemed relaxed and at ease.  This brings me to my third and final point, the staff. The staff here are excellent and they really add to the environment. I was greeted immediately by multiple, geniunely happy employees. Not that fake-smile BS happy that you get at most places, but that I-geniunely-enjoy-my-job happy smile that makes everyone feel better. The only other place I've met people who I knew were that genuinely happy while working was Pittsburgh Willy's, but check their page for that info.  Anyways, I really love this place and I will be back. Fresh, organic meals at these prices and sizes just don't exist anywhere else that I know of. Plus, this is one of the bets places to just sit, relax, and completely forget about work while on your lunch break. I'll just have to head back soon!

This is a great place to go to after work to grab a beer, or just hang out with some friends. They have an INSANE draft selection, even having a cider (Fox Barrel) on draft! It got really busy while I was there the first time, but still had a pretty relaxed, hang-out kind of feel to it where you didn't notice that there were so many people there. The selection of beers is unbelievable here, with an entire wall of different bottles that they carry. I was disappointed that they didn't have my favorite, Harpoon UFO, though, but not surprised because I have yet to find a place out west that carries it. I had a glass of the Fox Barrel Cider on draft and a Margarita Pizza. The pizza was only the personal size, but easily big enough for my girlfriend and I to split, and very tasty. My girlfriend even finds herself craving their pizza now, rather than pizza from an actual pizza joint.   So, if you wanna go hang out with the guys, get a quick bite and a drink with your girlfriend, or go on a crazy beer safari, Papago Brewing Company is a great choice and I recommend it.

This place is fantastic. It looks like a deli that they put a bunch of italian groceries in and some italian baked goods. Its not a small place, but it feels small because there are so many shelves of groceries and not that many tables. Anyways, there was no line and ordering was very fast. They make you walk past the baked goods and deli meats before you get to the register to order, so look away if you know what you want and don't want to end up ordering extra baked goods and taking deli meat home! After you order, they give you a number and you find a place to sit. They will come out with your food and call the number when you are done. All-in-all, fast process.  On to the food! My girlfriend had the Gnocchi with Alfredo Sauce (you could also order it with a Pesto or a Red Sauce), I had a Lasagna and Half of an Eggplant Parmigiana Sandwich, and we shared a Chocolate Cannoli. First off, the Gnocchi was the BEST I have ever eaten, which is saying a lot because my girlfriend orders Gnocchi EVERYWHERE we go that serves it. The texture of the Gnocchi was perfect; tender, but not too soft. The alfredo sauce on top absolutely completed the dish and complemented the little potato dumplings perfectly. I highly recommend the Gnocchi and Guarantee you won't be disappointed. The Lasagna was good, definitely above average, but it was missing my favorite part of Lasagna, those delicious burnt edges. The Eggplant Parmigiana sandwich was good, but the breading on the Eggplant Parmigiana didn't have any crunch to it. I know that Parmigiana isn't supposed to have a lot of crunch, but I just wanted a little. The Cannoli was awesome. The shell was dipped in chocolate (you don't have to get it this way) and stuffed with the classic ricotta cheese-based mixture, which I think had some chocolate shavings in it. If you like cannolis, definitely give them a try here.   In conclusion, I will be back, and I will have to try a cheesesteak, because they are supposed to be legendary and that seemed to be what 75% of people came in for.

I stayed here this past weekend and it was great! The room was nice: had a very comfortable bed, large LCD TV, nice bathroom, etc. The staff here was friendly, especially the housekeeping staff, and there is a lot to do. The pool is beautiful! Our view was pretty bad from our room, but we didn't want to pay for the slightly nicer room with the nice view, so that's on us.   The absolute best part about the Mirage, though, is the location. On one side you have the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, on the other side you have Treasure Island, and across the street you have the Venetian. If you can't find anything to do around here, you should just go home.   The only thing that I didn't like about the hotel was the temperature. This hotel is FREEZING, especially in the hallways to the rooms. My room was set to about 55 degrees when I arrived. TOO COLD! Also, seems illogical to have it that low by default because it probably loses them a lot of money.   Anyways, I enjoyed my stay here and I would love to return!

Okay, so I've been to the Carnegie Deli in New York, and it is fantastic. I was staying that the mirage and remembered how awesome the New York location was and decided I had to take my girlfriend there. Wrong Decision. This place was awful in comparison to the New York location.  The food was okay, which is not saying much for Carnegie, because the New York location has FANTASTIC food. I'm also a little peeved because in NY, you can get the Blintzes with their fruit toppings, and we couldn't here. That was the first strike, since Blintzes at Carnegie are amazing. I had the Corned Beef Hash and my girlfriend had the Thick Cut Ham and 3 eggs with home fries. I was really expecting a lot out of the hash because they are known for their amazing Pastrami and Corned Beef. Wasn't impressed. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. It wasn't bad flavor, but there wasn't much there to taste. It seemed like the way they cooked it took the flavor out of the corned beef. Maybe I should have gone with the Pastrami Hash, but who knows? Anyways, my girlfriends meal was definitely better than mine, much more on par with the breakfast I expected at Carnegie. The ham was cooked and had a nice caramelization going on. The fried eggs over easy were cooked perfectly, but the home fries just weren't that great. The inside was a little dry and the outside was a little soggy without much flavor. That was probably the most disappointing part for me because I absolutely love good home fries.  Next, the service. The service here is bad, especially in comparison to NY. I hate to keep comparing it to NY, but if you are going to use their name, it's gonna happen. In NY, the employees seemed happy, lots of smiles, friendly, and it was like they enjoyed working their. Here, I didn't see a single smile and every employee looked like they wanted to punch someone in the face. Our server asked us what we wanted to eat like 3 times in the first 2 minutes we were there, but we needed a bit to decide, and they didn't return for 20 more minutes. I said a needed a couple minutes, not 20. The kicker, though, was at the end of the meal. In case you couldn't tell from other reviews, the portions are HUGE here. So, I obviously had some of my hash left over (about a third of it) and wanted a box. When I asked for a box, the server asked "Are you serious?" and looked at me like I was an idiot. No, I was joking! You caught me! (Sarcasm).  In conclusion, don't go to Carnegie unless you are in New York. Walk the extra 20 feet down the hallway and go to BLT Burger, where you will not be disappointed.

The food here is great, but a few things prevented me from giving it a better rating.  Anyways, I'll start with the food. Fan-freaking-tastic food here. Prices are absolutely absurd, but the food is delicious. First, we had an order of Salmon Sashimi. BEST salmon sashimi I have ever had. I don''t even know how to describe it, but it was by far the most delicious piece of fish I have ever eaten. The unbelievable taste of this sashimi is really the only reason I went with four stars instead of 3. Bad part? Two pieces of sashimi was $10!!!! At $5 a piece, it better be the best I've ever eaten! We also had a Tuna roll, which was tiny. It was delicious, but way too small. If I remember correctly, it was about $12 or $13, but was only 6 tiny little pieces. For our meal, we split a Nori-Encrusted Salmon. I split a meal? Who the hell is this idiot, right? The only reason we split was because the top of the menu had a note along the lines of  "our dishes are designed for two", not because we were being really cheap. FALSE. Since when is a 5 or 6 oz. piece of salmon sized for two? The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was moist and flaky, and the pan-fried crispy nori crust added a great flavor, but the sized for two thing really irritated me. Maybe I read it wrong and that was only referring to another section of the menu, but that should have been more clear. Additionally, the presentation of the dishes was really great. No beef here with any of the presentation or the styling of the dishes.  As for service, it was good. The entire staff was friendly, nothing special though. The one thing that really got me started before we even got there. When I called to make a reservation, I was asked, "Are you celebrating a special occasion?", to which I replied, "Yes, we are celebrating my Girlfriend's birthday." There were only two of us, so it should have been obvious whose birthday it was (I am a dude, she is not). But, nobody did anything for her birthday. We didn't even get a single person to just SAY "Happy Birthday." Not that I expected a free dessert or anything, but at the prices here, I at least expected someone to say something.  In conclusion, I am not sure if I will be back. Maybe I would for the lounge dinner ($45 for two appetizers and an entree) to split with someone and one order of sashimi, but that's probably it.

Best burger place ever! My Fiancee and I love In-N-Out-Burger! At first glance, it seems like an average burger place with just a few menu items, however, once you know about the "secret menu" everything changes. You can get anything from grilled onions with special sauce to lettuce wrapped burgers, all absolutely delicious. Their fries are also amazing, especially animal style. I love that they use fresh ingredients and make their fries right on the spot.   When I want a burger,  In-N-Out-Burger is definitely the only place I go!   Last but not least, try a neapolitan shake, it will be the best shake you have ever had!

I've been to Corleone's a few times now, and it's not terrible. I couldn;t really pinpoint what it was, but none of the toppings really had that "oomph" you look for in a great cheesesteak. I must admit, I was a little disappointed. Philly cheesesteaks are just a classic food and I was really expecting a little more, especially for the price. It's not that the food is bad, but the price is definitely high for the taste. I just have a hard time spending that much on a cheesesteak when there is a Jimmy John's (much cheaper) and a Five Guys Burgers (delicious) just a little down the street. One upside, though, is the Cheez Whiz. That stuff, in my opinion, is a great way to make Cheesesteaks and one of the main reasons I wanted to come to Corleone's in the first place. There just aren't that many places around that offer Cheez Whiz for their cheesesteaks. I'll probably be back only because of the convenience of the location. I know that I'll catch myself craving another great cheesesteak (as I do often) while I am near here and end up going in to give it just one more chance, only to be disappointed as I was the other few times I went in.

Burrito Company is one of me and my fiancee's favorite places in Ahwatukke. Especially now that they moved into a new, larger building, they are super fast and have delicious food! Something that sets them apart from other places is that they offer whole wheat tortillas, an option that I really like.  Everyone that works there is very friendly and we love that you can call in your orders for pick up! I would definitely recommend the Burrito Company and would also recommend that you try the #5 (carne asada burrito)!

I was introduced to this place by Groupon, and couldn't say no because I am such a big fan of Margaritas. It was a great place for lunch with some friends. It's probably great for dinner with a few friends, too. Service was okay, not spectacular but acceptable. I wouldn't recommend walking in with a large group unless you called ahead (if you can) because they don't seem like they could quickly get stuff situated for you.  I had a breaded lobster taco, shredded beef taco, and Prickly Pear Margarita. My friend had the same, but with a POM-rita instead of the Prickly Pear Margarita. All the Margaritas here are made with fresh ingredients (fresh-squeezed limes, etc.) and not some mixes that have been sitting in bottles in the fridge forever. I honestly like the POM-rita better than the Prickly Pear Margarita, but they were both very good and quite large. However, the Margaritas are really expensive. I would recommend coming during happy hour because they are all half-price during happy hour. Plus, appetizers are half-price then, too. And on Mondays, the house margarita is only $3.00 ALL DAY long. I'll definitely be back for some happy hour margaritas and on a Monday off. As for the Tacos, the breaded lobster taco was really disappointing. The sauce they put on it didn't pair that well with the fried lobster, and the pieces of lobster were overcooked and a bit too chewy/dry for my tastes. However, The shredded beef taco was AMAZING. After I started eating the shredded beef taco, I knew I would be coming back for more of them. It's just a classic shredded beef taco with the classic trimmings in a crunchy taco shell (the shell seemed like it was fried very close to when I ate it, yet wasn't oily and they didn't salt it), but they must be doing something a little different because it was just too damn good.   To sum up, I will be back and definitely recommend this place, but if you want to drink margaritas with some of those awesome shredded beef tacos, I would stick to Happy Hour, because the prices are pretty steep.  **Edit: Just found out from a fellow Yelper that they have $1.00 shredded beef tacos on tuesdays. That just moved it from 4 stars to 5 in my book and I will probably spend way too many tuesdays here. Thanks, Lindsey!

Oh Pappadeaux's, how I wish you were closer to my home. If I didn't have to drive 40-45 minutes to get there, I would probably spend my entire paycheck on two things: Oysters and Fried Alligator. As such, I'm going to stick to those two things in my review. Those are really the only two things that I eat when I go, because I cannot get enough of them.  First things first, the staff and ambiance. The music can get a little bit loud, but the atmosphere is always fun and upbeat. The staff all seems to be pretty friendly, too. Our server was especially friendly and helpful. This is definitely a place I like to go to with my friends to hang out and have a good night.  Now, I'll talk about the food. First, the oysters. The oysters here are great! They give you a few different sauces to go along with them, each of which has a distinct, delicious flavor to add. To make the oysters even better, they have incredible deals on them! They only cost about $4.00 per dozen for the special they supposedly have running almost all the time. The type of oysters that you get on the special vary based on whatever factors affect the catching of oysters. As for the Fried Alligator, IT'S FRIED ALLIGATOR. As soon as I saw it on the menu, I had to have it. To quote one of my favorite movies (Transformers), "Alligator is the most succulent meat." The Fried Alligator here is one of my favorite things to eat. I absolutely cannot have enough Fried Alligator. The meat is moist and juicy with a light and non-fishy flavor, and the batter/breading layer is fried crisp. That combo of the moist meat with the crispy outside is phenomenal. Add on the dusting of cajun seasoning and the creole dipping sauce, and you have a dish you won't forget.   In conclusion, I definitely recommend this place. I can't really speak for anything other than the oysters and the fried alligator, but do I need to? Come on, it's Fried Alligator and cheap oysters! Stop reading and go to Pappadeaux's!

I absolutely loved eating here. The atmosphere is great, cool decoration. The service was fantastic and our server was very friendly. I would list off everything we ordered, but there were five of us and I couldn't remember the names of half the things we ordered, let alone all the desserts (we ordered 3 sampler platters for dessert, so I'll just stick to a few. My father ordered one of the duck dishes, I don't remember which one since I didn't place the order, but it was fantastic. The duck was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a perfect complement to the natural flavors of the duck. The two rolls we ordered were the Samba Strip and the Bobo Brazil. The Bobo brazil was absolutely phenomenal. The seared kobe inside was of great quality and worked very well with all of the other ingredients. The Samba Strip was very different for me, as I had never had a roll with Lobster and was a little unsure, but I'm glad we went with it! I loved the way the peanut curry worked with the mango and the texture of the lobster. The most memorable part of the night, by far, was ordering the dessert. My girlfriend is from Brazil and one of her absolute favorite things is Brigadeiro. She was ecstatic to see it on the dessert menu in one of the dishes, because it is difficult to find a place that makes Brigadeiro (good or not aside, there just aren't many places that have it), especially where we live (AZ). She asked our server if she could just get a small plate of Brigadeiro by itself for dessert, and the server he would have to check with the chef. Here, though, they went a little above and beyond for me. Despite the Brigadeiro being listed only as an ingredient in a dish, the chef said that they would make a plate by itself, just for us. However, the chef wanted to inform us that it was not traditional brigadeiro, and even prepared a small sample for us to try before ordering a plate so that we wouldn't be disappointed if we were hoping for the traditional stuff. I can't find fault with service like that.  On a side-note, they have a dish that is cooked on a hot stone and comes out sizzling on that hot stone. I have no idea what it was called, but it was ordered repeatedly by other tables and smelled absolutely phenomenal. I would go back just to sit at the bar and be able to smell that dish being brought out to other tables.

Hands-down, this is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. I went with my girlfriend. We shared an order of fries, she had the classic with American cheese, I had the "BLT" with Oregon cheddar, and we shared a strawberry milkshake.   The shake was, by far, the best milkshake I have ever had. We got Strawberry because it is my girlfriend's favorite, but they have many more interesting flavors, like Twinkie Boy (made with twinkies), Campfire Marshmallows (made with toasted marshmallows), the Lunchbox (made with peanut butter and jelly), or the Nut Jub (made with hazelnut ice cream and Nutella). Being in Las Vegas, they even have a section on their menu devoted specifically to Spiked Milkshakes! Both of the burgers were a good size, big enough that I wasn't annoyed at the size, but small enough that I wasn'y amazed by it. My girlfriend's burger was very good, but not special because she didn't add anything to it. The "BLT", on the other hand, was amazing. The double-smoked bacon was crisp, but not at all burnt or overdone, and the "double-smoked" flavor was fantastic. Also, there was something special about the Oregon cheddar and I enjoyed its flavor much more than other cheddars. I didn't notice until after I ordered, but they offer fried eggs as an optional topping. That really made this place for me, because fried eggs are awesome on burgers (if you haven't tried one on a burger, you are seriously missing out). I can't decide if I want to try the "BLT" again, with chili, a fried egg, and Oregon cheddar, or if I want to try the Buffalo Chicken burger next time. Either way, I'm positive I won't be disappointed. To top it off, though, the fries were delicious. They were cooked to a slight crunch, but not over done, and the inside was light and fluffy. Also, they didn't obliterate the fries with salt before bringing them out, allowing you to add the amount of salt you like, which was great for me because I hate salt on my fries.  The service here was good. We didn't have to wait very long for lunch and our server was friendly. She was very good at knowing what time to check on us and took good care of us. I especially liked that she didn't get annoyed when we needed a few extra minutes to decide what we wanted (like at the Carnegie Deli down the hall) and just came back in a few minutes, instead of checking every 30 seconds for the first 2 minutes and then ditching us for 20 minutes (which is what happened at Carnegie)  To all the complainers about the high price, THIS IS VEGAS. Yes, the price is high, but don't pretend like you didn't see it coming. EVERYTHING on the Strip is expensive. For the Strip, I found this place reasonable, especially for the quality and size of the food, along with the service. If you don't like the prices, you picked the wrong place for your vacation and you should just go home so the rest of us don't have to wait.  Anyways, I'll definitely be back here next time I am on the Strip. Can't wait to try those shakes!

The ice cream here is absolutely amazing! My girlfriend and I decided to go here after stopping by their tent at the Ahwatukee Farmer's market. I had White Chocolate Raspberry and Pumpkin Cheesecake. Both of the flavors were amazing! My favorite was the White Chocolate Raspberry, but the cheesecake flavor in the Pumpkin Cheesecake was really good. My girlfriend had the Banana Cream Pie, which was also great. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about any of the food here. Everything tastes fresh and delicious, as expected from a place whose products come from their own, local farm!  The service was also impeccable. The people behind the counter are very friendly! My girlfriend and I hadn't been before and didn't know what we wanted, but we didn't want to be the annoying people who just keep sampling everything, but they told us to just keep sampling. They didn't seem bothered by the possibility of us trying every flavor, they actually encouraged it before we decided!  Anyways, this place is great. If it was closer to where I lived, it would definitely be my go-to place for some awesome ice cream!

I've been trying to make it here for a couple weeks now, and just managed to make it there today. Let me just start off by saying, if you want a REAL hot dog, this is definitely the place to be. When you come down Arizona Ave., you will see a "Gourmet Hot Dogs" sign a little south of Warner Rd. As you pull into the parking lot, don't be deterred when you notice the only thing there is an Antiques store. Pittsburgh Willy's is tucked into a little corner of the store (to the left when you walk in the front entrance). It is a small stand with a few tables nearby and Randy "Pittsburgh Willy" Walters, himself, behind the counter. This guy knows his hot dogs and is one of the friendliest people around. He makes conversation with everyone and provides one of the most relaxed, comfortable atmospheres you could imagine. I ordered the Freddie G., The Arizonan, and the Chili n' Cheese. And yes, I finished all three. All of the hot dogs were fantastic, with the delicious, all beef, 1/4 dogs. For a list of all the ingredients in each, see his website. The Arizonan is definitely one of the unique ones he has. The peppered bacon with some chilis provides a perfect contrast with the creamy, fresh guacamole for that fantastically unique taste. My favorite was definitely the Freddie G., the crunchy, french-fried onions, combined with what is probably the best Barbeque Sauce I have ever tasted (F.Y.I., this dog is named after the Barbeque sauce used). The sauce wasn't too strong, and was a perfect compliment to the all-beef dogs from cloud 9. The Chili n' Cheese can be ordered two ways; neat or sloppy. I ordered neat because he said the sloppy was much larger (more chili) and it was my third dog for the meal. After the dogs, my friend and I split the "Ice-cream Sammich' Sundae". The sunday was HUGE. I would recommend bringing a friend if you want to try it, as even Randy recommended we split one. The Sunday has an ice cream sandwich on the bottom, topped with peanuts, bananas, chocolate sauce, a large scoop of ice cream, and whipped cream. That was a delicious way to end the meal, with all of the ingredients working together in harmony, just as they did in the hot dogs.  To sum up, I will definitely be back here. I would say that the food was well worth the money, but that would be a lie, because it is worth FAR MORE (Don't tell Randy). I challenge you to try to find a better hot dog, and caution you to not hold your breath, because I have been searching for dogs like this for a long time. On a side note, I cannot wait to come back on a Wednesday for the Pierogies.

I went here a month or so ago, and forgot to write my review, but I remember the whole lunch very well because it was such a terribly disappointing experience. I desperately wanted to like this place, because I work so close and love Thai food, but it was just not a good experience. The food wasn't horrible, but nothing that made me want to come back, and the service was awful.   I'll start with the food. I ordered the Pra-Rahm lunch special. At the time I went, it was described as coming with a Spicy and Peanut Sauce. I took this as being one sauce, and this was exactly what I was looking for. However, when they brought it out, I found that these were two completely separate sauces. One was a very watery, spiced sauce, and the other was an incredibly thick, very sweet peanut sauce. The two didn't mix well, and neither really had that flavor I was looking for. The spicy one wasn't hot, rather just had a lot of spices in it. The peanut sauce was too thick and sweet for my tastes (would have been much better on top of some kind of dessert, in my opinion). The chicken and vegetables I had were cooked well, but I couldn't enjoy them because of the sauces.  Now, I'll talk about the service. The entire place was being served by only two servers. Not that this place is huge, but there are probably 25ish tables in there, which is far too many for 2 people, if you want any service at all. On top of that, I managed to overhear one server talking and learned that one of the servers was training. So, really, there were only about 1.5 servers working. There is seemingly no organization as to which server helps with table, either. I walked in and was taken to a table by one server. I looked at the menu for a few minutes, decided on the Pra-Rahm, and set it down to wait for my server to return. 15 minutes went by before someone returned. The server that returned asked what I wanted to drink, and left. They came back with water, and didn't ask for my order, walking away again. It wasn't until I had been sitting for about 30 minutes that someone took my order. That, to me, is an absolutely ridiculous amount of time. Every time one of the two servers working walked by, they would make eye contact, and then look for the other, like they thought the other person was supposed to be taking care of me. It's not that they weren't friendly on the rare occasion that they made it to my table, they just didn't take care of their duties as servers. I could see the manager working, handling the to-go orders, but she wasn't doing much. You would think that the manager would help serve, since that was where the restaurant really needed help (not many to-go orders coming through), but she just watched and walked back into the kitchen. I was more patient than many others who had come in after me, as I watched them leave, but I wish I had followed their lead, because I probably would have ended up at Sweet Cakes, which is next door. Some of you think that the manager probably had other things to do, they couldn't possibly help, but that isn't true. I worked in a restaurant for almost 2 years, and during the meal rushes is usually the least busy time for managers, they end up helping out everyone else most of the time. Its toward the ends of the shifts and days that they have a pile-up of managerial duties to take care of.  All-in-all, this was just a terrible experience, and I can't see myself returning here when I can guarantee a great lunch experience next door at Sweet Cakes.

I can describe this place in four words: simple, healthy, delicious, and inexpensive!  I love this place. I'll start with the simple part. You can either order plates or bowls. The plates are the same as the bowls, but plus a side of salad and the fresh local fruit they have that day. As for the structure of the bowls, you can get some combination of meat, vegetables, and rice. For rice, you can choose between white and brown. The vegetables are just an assortment of the standard vegetables. The meat is either chicken or ribeye meat.  On to the healthy part: The rice is always steamed, never any oil, etc. added into anything! No trans fats in any of their dishes! The meat is charbroiled, in order to maintain the oil-free thing. The skin is removed from all of the chicken to reduce the fat content. This is probably the healthiest option for food anywhere near ASU.  Delicious: The sauce that they have is great. I would say it's some kind of modification of a teriyaki sauce, and you can tell a lot of effort went into that sauce. They only have the one sauce, but it is a great one. They have a cajun-hot sauce on the side, also, in case you want to add a little heat, which I usually do.   Inexpensive: The bowls are around $5.00. They don't look that big, but because they are so healthy, they will fill you up.   The first week I tried this place, I went back 3 times (3 days in a row). I cannot get enough of this place and I will be back soon.

I was so hopeful that I finally found a great place to get an italian hoagie. I was craving one, so I made my way over to Cucina di Vita. This visit, however, was a disaster.   We will start with what I hoped my visit would be like. I planned on coming in, picking out exactly what I wanted to order, ordering to-go, maybe conversing with one of the employees for a bit, waiting about 10 minutes for my food, and heading back to work. I didn't think that too much, but that was leaps and bounds beyond what I actually experienced.  To start, the first person I spoke with, who seemed to be the one that usually runs the register and takes the orders, wasn't very friendly. She seemed very annoyed and frustrated that I didn't know exactly what I wanted at the exact moment I walked through the door and definitely let it show. After a few minutes past, I was ready to order, but the woman I spoke of before was too busy talking to some other employees, so someone who usually makes the food helped check me out. She was far friendlier than the person I initially talked to, but that didn't make the transaction any smoother.   First, I wanted to order a minestrone soup, a white brownie with chocolate chips (they had two kinds of brownies), and an italian hoagie, However, I was immediately told that they were out of minestrone soup (apparently the manager or someone had taken all of it to some conference or meeting nearby). So, I asked for a side italian summer salad instead, and then the charged rang up my order and charged my credit card. A few minutes later, after the person who rang me up explained to the rest of the employees that the italian summer salad WAS on the menu and they did need to make it, I was informed that they didn't have the italian summer salad because "all the cantaloupe was bad". I decided to just stick to the hoagie and the brownie, but it took them 5-10 minutes just to figure out how to refund my credit card and re-run it to charge me for the new amount.   Finally, my order was in. I waited like 5-10 more minutes and they brought out my food. To my surprise, I noticed that they had left a second brownie in my bag, probably for some of the inconvenience of the transaction. At first I was happy, but then I realized that neither of the brownies was the kind that I had asked for. This was definitely not the best experience I have ever had for lunch. I went with two stars, though, because the hoagie wasn't bad, but definitely not worth all of the other crap I went through. There are too many other good places around here to bother with all that nonsense again. Try it if you want, but I don't recommend it. If you really want a good, italian deli, make your way over to Defalco's on Scottsdale Rd. a little north of McDowell.

***UPDATED*** - Please see the update.  I have been here before, and while I do really like their Frozen Yogurt, I will not be returning after tonight. The other times I have been in, the staff wasn't very friendly, but at least I ended up with some delicious frozen yogurt. Tonight, three of my friends and I wanted to get some frozen yogurt. We weren't going to be able to make it in until about 10:15PM, though, because of some other stuff going on. We called at 9:00PM to make sure they would be open, and were told that they would be open until 11:00PM. I thought, "Awesome! Here comes my froyo!" When we got there, the sign on the door even said that they were open until 11:00PM (It was about 10:20PM when we walked in). When we walked in, we were promptly told that it was closed. Despite being told over the phone that they were open until 11:00PM and the sign in front saying 11:00PM, we were told to leave and did not get our frozen yogurt. We weren't even offered an explanation, just repeatedly told "We closed at 10:00PM tonight."

So, after my original review, I was contacted by Mike B., the GM of Zoyo contacted me and was very concerned with how we were treated. He invited us in to apologize and for a free Froyo. When we arrived, we spoke with Ryan, the manager working at the time. He was very concerned about what happened when we went last week and very apologetic. He assured us that they were, indeed, supposed to be open until 11:00PM and that we should not have been told otherwise. It seemed like they were working very hard to try to figure out why that happened and to prevent it from ever happening again. The people we saw and spoke to today were also far more friendly and had a much nicer attitude than whoever asked us to leave the first time.  As for the Froyo, it was delicious. I had the Very Berry Sorbet, and it was excellent, despite being the Non-dairy option. Most Froyo places have a tough time maintaining the good flavor with a non-dairy option, but Zoyo did not have that problem! In fact, I even opted to not add toppings to the Froyo because it was tasty enough on it's own.   All-in-all, I would recommend this place. It seems that our unfortunate first visit was a fluke and is very unlikely to happen again, and if the GM's response wasn't great customer service, then I don't know what is. So, if you are in the area and need to get your Froyo on, definitely give Zoyo a try!

Let me start by saying that I desperately wanted to like this place and give a positive review. DESPERATELY. I even feel a little bad about the review because the people were very nice, but when I review restaurants the FOOD comes first. The only time service overrides food in my ratings is when the service prevents me from getting any food. Anyways, continue for the actual review.  When I heard about this kart, I was extremely excited. I mean, BACON-WRAPPED HOT DOGS. How could that possibly go wrong? Apparently, there are a lot of ways.  I will start off with some of the things I liked about this place. First, the people working were very friendly, even if they had a hard time understanding what we were saying (didn't seem like their English was that great, i.e. when I asked where the tip jar was, they handed me a paper bag to put my soda in). They were generous enough to give us free drinks because we showed up right when they arrived and before they were set up, so we had to wait. Obviously, that was our fault and they didn't have to do that (this is why I went for the second star here) Second, the food is very low-priced. Third, they have Mexican Coke! You know, the good version of Coca-Cola? Unfortunately, none of these things were the reason that I wanted to eat here.  Now, for the things that I didn't like so much. First off, when the hell are these people around!?!? It took my 5 tries before I actually managed to head over while they were there. As far as I can tell, they will be there around 7PM if they are coming at all and tend to come on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday Nights, if at all. As for the food, the hot dog was far from exceptional. Yes, the hot dog was bacon-wrapped. No, the bacon was not good. The bacon was the thinnest-cut, soggiest piece of bacon I have ever had. I was hoping for a thicker-cut, cooked to a little crisp or char, but that was not the case. Also, the bacon had very little flavor, probably due to how thin and soggy it was. On top of that, the hot dog was OBLITERATED with mayonnaise. I had to spend some time trying to scoop off the mayonnaise before I could eat it. Also, the hot dog seemed like your standard, store-bought hot dog without any of the really good hot dog flavor. I also tried the quesadilla, but it wasn't anything special.It was just a slightly greasy quesadilla with a mexican cheese inside, but that's about it. Food-wise, there just wasn't anything special about the food here. They didn't add their own little bit of magic, or whatever you wanna call it that makes it unique. And that little something special is absolutely necessary to make yourself stand out, especially with something as generic as a hot dog and a quesadilla.  Maybe I just had my expectations set too high at the cue of Bacon-wrapped hot dogs, but i didn't find anything special here. I wish I could say otherwise about something as wondrous as a bacon-wrapped hot dog, but I can't. Anyways, if you want to try it, I won't stop you. But, don't be fooled by the appeal and the potential magic of the bacon-wrapped hot dog, because you will be disappointed. I will only recommend this Cart (which, by the way, has recently upgraded to a truck/van) if you want something cheap. However, you will need a lot of luck for this truck to actually be there when you want it.

The creme brulee on this food truck is unbelievable! This has to be the best I have ever had. Plus, the variety of flavors means you will never get sick of it! He is very creative with his flavors, not just sticking to the usual chocolate, fruit, and vanilla standards of most places. I've tried two flavors, my first being the Chocolate, and second was the Maple. The Chocolate was by far the best chocolate creme brulee I have ever had (at least until I got to the maple with caramelized bacon!). The Maple was an entirely new experience for me, though. He topped it with some bacon (organic and from a local company called Pork-on-a-Fork), which he charred to a perfect, delicious crispy texture with the torch. The savory flavors of the bacon made it a perfect accompaniment to the Maple creme brulee! I hope he decides to keep that flavor and topping around! If he has the Maple topped with Bacon, definitely go for that one. Don't be afraid of the unique flavor you won't find anywhere else!  As for service, the guy behind the truck is extremely friendly. He loves to take the time to talk to everyone that stops by his truck and told me that he will even be stopping at someone's party for a while for a birthday of someone who loves creme brulee. That's awesome and I would love to have him come to one of my parties!  To sum up, I will be going back to this place as regularly as possible. Definitely give it a try if you have any interest in good dessert.

I walk past this place every day on my way to class and finally managed to stop in and try it out. The inside of the place is tiny. Fortunately they have a lot of outside seating for everyone. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I grabbed one of the menus to take a look. To be honest, I expected there to be more on the menu. Based on the menu, you can get a Taco, Burrito, Torta, Quesadilla, or Vampiro. That sounds like a decent number of choices, because in most places you get the choice of Chicken, Pork a few different ways, beef (shredded, ground, or carne asada), fish, etc. Here, the only choices listed were Carne Asada and Pastor (a marinated pork). I thought the Pastor sounded good, but was disappointed that those are the only choices.  The other thing that struck me is that the descriptions on the menu are not that accurate. The quesadilla and the vampiro have the SAME description, except that one lists flour tortilla and one lists corn tortilla. So, I ordered the vampiro because of the corn tortilla and because the price was a dollar less. When I got it, i found out that it is not at all like a quesadilla, and is in fact a lot like a tostada, not something that I had hoped for. It was open face and the tortilla was fried crisp. Also, IT WAS TINY. The vampiro was almost $4.00, it was much smaller than a standard tostada, and it wasn't loaded with the meat and toppings. The food didn't taste bad, but I wasn't thrilled with it, either.  All-in-all, I'm not sure ill be back. For that price and size, the food should be better. If the size goes up, price goes down, or the taste improves, then I'll probably come back. Until then, though, my go-to mexican place is Carolina's.

So, let me start by saying that we just grabbed a slice of the Chocolate Pizza to go. Not much, but we wanted a dessert and figured that a place based entirely around chocolate would be a good choice.   To continue, the chocolate on the chocolate pizza may be the best chocolate I have ever had. The chocolate pizza has a sweet pizza dough covered with liquid milk and white chocolate. To be honest, I felt like the dough actually took a little bit away from the fantastic chocolate, mostly because the pizza dough isn't very soft. However, the chocolate was so good that it didn't matter. I would like to see a version of the pizza with a traditional, crunchy, thin crust. I can't wait to go back and try the other food, especially a Double Dark Chocolate Cookie. If you just want a sweet chocolatey dessert, I would recommend the Chocolate Syringe, which is a giant syringe filled with warm chocolate that you just squirt into your mouth. At $5.00, its a very reasonable, delicious dessert for the Vegas strip.  As for the service, the person helping us at the little stand outside was extremely friendly. They were able to answer all of our questions and seemed very knowledgable about all the items offered.   In conclusion, I will be back here when I'm back on the strip and it is definitely going on my list of favorites! I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.

I've been to a lot of frozen yogurt places (I swear a new one opens daily in Phoenix), but this one is definitely my favorite. The frozen yogurt is delicious, creamy, and doesn't taste artificial. We had the chocolate and the dulce de leche flavors, which were delicious on their own and together. Along with this, they had crepes! It isn't listed on their website, though. We had a Smore's crepe along with our froyo, and the crepe was great! All the fillings and toppings were delicious and the crepe held together quite well.  The employees working here were very friendly. The only thing that I disliked had to do with sampling the froyo flavors. They require an employee to be standing out by the froyo machines with the people sampling the froyo to prevent people from refilling the sample cups and not buying anything, but it was far too busy for that. There were only two people working, and it was late night in Vegas, so there were way too many customers to only have one person making the food and running the register while the other stood out and kept an eye on the froyo samplers.   All-in-all, I loved the food here and definitely plan on coming back for a snack or dessert (and more crepes!) next time I am in Vegas. Recommended!  P.S.- For Vegas, the prices are very reasonable.

I love Yollipop! There are several frozen yogurt places in this area and Yollipop is by far the best! They have amazing, unique flavors like cotton candy (which actually tastes like the best cotton candy you have ever had), caramel macchiato, coconut, etc. They also have a ton of toppings from fruit to syrups to candy. You name it, they have it.   The people who work there are super friendly and instead of an easy to lose punch card, they have a system where they keep track of your purchases by using your phone number (no they don't text you or sell it or anything) and you get 10% of what your purchased off your purchase that day, or you can save it and accumulate it towards future purchases! Very cleaver and easy way to reward their customers!  All in all, best frozen yogurt place ever.

My Fiancee and I were in the area and were looking for a new place to try. We happened to check Groupon's Groupon Now deals and Limelight was one of the deals. Since we had been wanting to try Limelight for quite some time we decided to get the deal and try it out!  We thought the whole concept for a dipping bar was great, and really enjoyed the food. We each ordered a sandwich, I ordered a side of mac-and-cheese, and my Fiancee ordered a side of combo fries (regular and sweet potato fires mixed together). Our sandwiches were good, we enjoyed the dipping sauces and we loved the fries. We also ordered drinks, which were delicious, but a bit on the expensive side.   The service was good and very fast, but we were one of only two groups in the whole place. All in all, we enjoyed it and would go there again.
