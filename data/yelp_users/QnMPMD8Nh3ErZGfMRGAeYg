I drove a considerable distance to have this BBQ and was very unhappy with the meal experience. The pork was very dry and obviously old as were the sides. Price was ok but who cares if your meal tastes bad. The sauce was ok yet still unable to bring back to life the leather like dry pieces of pork I found in my sandwich with every bite. People who enjoy good BBQ should avoid this place.  I just read several other yelper reviews of this restaurant so Im going to raise my original 1 star to 2 for now and Im going to drive all the way back down to Central from Scottsdale to give them another shot who knows maybe I just got a bad batch then Im gonna come back here and comment on round 2.

I give very few 5 star reviews however I must say that this place is without doubt the most deserving.  The food is simply amazing as is their outstanding wine list and best views in the valley.  This place will satisfy the most demanding critic.  After a delightful dinner the wife and I spent several hours dancing in the lounge to live music classy music.  This place makes you feel like everyday is a honeymoon.  If you are looking for a place to impress anyone this is it.  Great Job Hilton.

For my daughters 21st Birthday we decided to take the family to Flemings and DC Ranch.  We drive by this restaurant on a daily basis and yet have never given them a chance so I never knew what we were missing until now.  The atmosphere is very nice they have a bar area with TV's if you just in for an informal high quality steak and outstanding cocktails.  The service was simply outstanding we were treated like royalty and when one of the steaks delivered to the table we just a little overcooked they brought out the chef and insisted we allow them to make another.  Best part is they let us keep the mistake - thats nice when your talking a $50.00 piece of prime beef.  The ribeyes are amazing - ask for the ribeye that they bring to the table and cut off the bone for you WOW.  The wine selection was among the best in Scottsdale and the cocktails a perfect blend.  Thank you Flemmings for your fine contribution to my daughters 21st.

Chicken Piquant Omelet- filled with chicken breast saute in butter, white wine, onions, green chilies and mushrooms finished with a spicy cream sauce and jack cheese. If this doesnt get your attention try the Portugese Sausage in an Omelet or Skillet. Simply Delicious. I am one who loves explosive flavor and unique food items so I was pleasently SURPRISED to find this experience in such a quaint off the beaten path restaurant. The small stature of this Cafe with outdoor seating and a hidden away feel adds to the dining experience. Highly recommended.

I really like this place the only real problem is the long lines and realative lack of space due to the large number of people trying to grab a slice of this goodness. Lots on the menu with many styles of pizza available and a value slice for the smaller pocket. Cold beer at the bar. Hurry up and open at the PV Mall. See you there for some italian goodness

I had driven by this little taco shop a dozen times never bothering to stop until today and Im glad I did. Not only are the prices very reasonable but the food is great and I love their free salsa bar especially the red chili pepper oil. I ordered the Carnitas Burrito and went after the hottest stuff they had in the salsa bar and found it to be one of the best sauces Ive ever had on a burro. Wow - hot yet great flavor and unlike any sauce I have seen before basically oil on top with red pepper congregated on the bottom. The atmosphere is plain yet clean and the menu is very large. I asked and they recommend the surf and turf burro or shrimp burro so I will be back for that however I brought home some of that tasty spiced oil to try on my next meal. I will be back again with the family.

Some of the food here is fantastic such as the Chicken Corfu $14.95 and others like the Gyro I found to be less than good becasue the meat was very dry some parts burnt with the obviously strong taste of fish.  I sent it back and they took it off our bill.  The remainder of the meal which consisted of the Corfu, salads and soup was great and our waitress; the owners daughter promised to address the Gyro with the kitchen.  This restaurant is located at the park in Fountain Hills with unobstructed views of the lake and fountain which erupts every hour spraying water more than 500 feet in the air.  We took a nice walk in the park after dinner which was very relaxing.  Recommended

Ive been going here for years and I must says its a fun afternoon to relax bet on the dogs and consume a few wings washed down with cold beer of course. The prices are average not cheap and the place is often packed but the layout somehow lessens the cramped feeling. Plenty of outdoor seating. I was a little disturbed on my last vist to see smaller chicken wings than I recalled in the past hope they didnt try to cut a corner because they used to be my favorite wings. They still taste good just really small now. I actually think I like the Notorious Pig BBQ Wings a little better now because they smoke them then fry um and they are bigger but its all good here anyway. Waitresses are always very nice and I have actually walked away with several free tabs and some extra money in my pocket after hitting on the dogs. All in all highly recommended for Pub and Grub.

We were looking for some great Mexican Food in old town and certainly didn't find it here.  The food was below average which was very disappointing.  The place looked like it was going to be great according to photos on the wall even Bobby Flay has met the owner I just hope he didn't taste the food.  The restrooms were located outside around the back of the building which sucked because our children had to go so that took considerable extra time.  The service was less than impressive as we had to beg for drink refills and table service.  They also forgot our desert.  Just an all around lame experience.

This review is for the dining experience not the resort which I would rate much lower. The food at Elements is exceptional but you will pay for it which is to be expected for such quality and atmosphere. The menu is changing always fresh and full of impressive flavors with a wine list to match. Views are among the best in the valley so make sure you request window seating when making reservations which is also a must. I would highly recommend this experience to impress that special someone in your life or close the big deal, however it is important to note that Elements will remain one of the better dining experiences in the valley as long as they continue to focus on the quality of the food and those in the kitchen who prepare the dishes. If either of these slip then this place could easily become as overrated as the Resort.

Ok I cant believe Im writing a 5 Star review for Dominos this certainly wasn't the result of one special delivery experience but rather a number of improvements over the past year.  First Dominos has been a company that constantly looks for ways to improve its food and menu.  They completely changed their entire sauce and crust recipe so the original pizza no longer exists and what we have now is a much better flavor profile.  They added several BBQ Chicken dishes and a bunch of new sauces such as garlic and habanero all excellent and stuffed cheezy bread.  We recently tried the new Pizza Hut out here on Pinnacle Peak and Pima three times over the last couple months because the girls wanted the stuffed crest and had very bad experience`s with order mistakes, cold pizza and limited toppings.  The fact is Pizza Hut is no longer competition for the flavors and quality you get at Dominos.  Im not saying these companies offer the best pizza Im just saying Dominos has the fastest pizza with the most flavor for the best price hands down.  The stuffed cheezy bread is off the charts the garlic sauce fantastic and they even have deep dish now.  We have ordered at least 20 times from this location of the past year and they have never made a mistake on our order.  That alone is amazing in itself.  We also ask them to crisp our pizza in the oven a little longer highly recommend that.  Great job Dominos with your menu expansion and better flavor profiles and sauces.  A well deserved review.

My wife and I recently moved from Cave Creek to East Scottsdale near Fountain Hills and were excited to get the Hi Speed Internet offered by Cox because this was not available in Cave Creek.  Unforturnatly, they have failed to show for three scheduled appointments!  The first to hook up our fax line and the others to fix our NON Hi Speed Internet.  Whats more important to note is that we did not recieve a courtesy call to inform us they wouldnt make it.  Moreover, on two occasions I spent at least a half hour trying to troubleshoot the issue before they would set up the appointments they missed.  On March 9th, 2010 I recieved a letter from them explaining that they were raising my download speed by 33% and my upload speed by 160% which consequently resulted a rate hike from $49 to $64.00.  I havent even recieved the Hi Speed Internet and fax line Ive been paying for since December so 2 Stars for these guys until they get it right.  This location is a main service center for Cox Customers located in Scottsdale where you can actually walk in an talk to a representative which has been the only positive part of this experience as the CS Reps seem to be courteous and professional both on the phone and in person.

Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse.

If you really know Phoenix then you've most likely visited this restaurant in the downtown area. Ive had the lunch and dinner experience here and found both to my liking. The soup and sandwich that I enjoyed for lunch was reasonably priced an flavorful. In fact I was somewhat supprised at the lunch value of this higher priced establishment. For dinner the fresh Snow Crab was a nice compliment to my Surf and Turf experience. The menu is large enough to satisfy a broad spectrum of palates. The entry through the kitchen from the rear of the restaurant is somewhat odd but this has been the way for many years and is unlikely to change. Some may enjoy this peek into the kitchen while others may find it somewhat disruptive to the formal dining experience. I enjoy this restaurant with its fresh food and decor from years past. Avoid this one if you are looking for a casual quiet evening as Durants is often packed throughout the evening. A couple cocktails at the bar, business meeting or a social dinner with friends is a more the feel here. Service is fantastic as many of the staff has remained for more than a decade.

My family flocks to this place like cattle to a watering hole on a hot day.  Theres usually 8 to 10 of us in a group and the service is always fantastic regardless of how busy they are.  From Salads to Entres everything is fresh with modest portions.  The atmosphere is very nice, casual dress not stuffy just a little noisy at times.  I would have rated this place a 5 star if the food had just a little more of a WOW factor that can only be found in an authentic mom and pops italian restaurant kinda like those found in New Yorks Little Italy.  Prices are reasonable. Highly Recommended.

We live in Scottsdale and yet we have stayed at the Fairmont more than a dozen times. You will simply not find a resort packed with more amenities anywhere in the valley. We know because we have experienced most of them. This resort goes all out to accommodate couples and families. We have watched musical concerts on the grass, played golf, caught catfish in the ponds (you can actually rent a pole), spent the day with our children at the water park, hit the spa, worked out, watched fireworks, shopped in the stores and experienced delicious food and beverage from the many onsite restaurants all in one weekend. I could go on however I simply recommend that you visit their website and book a stay at your earliest convenience. They often have special fun filled weekends setup for families so make sure and inquire about these if you have children and really want to experience a great weekend with them. Rooms are great beds are very comfortable. The only minor issue I might bring up for couples wanting to lay around the pool and have cocktails is the cost of these beverages which can easily run more than $10 each. Oh well I guess that can often be expected at resorts of this caliber. Have fun!!!

Lots of great things to say about this location which now serves a huge breakfast menu. The Sausage Sandwich is amazing as are the pizzas especially the "Chopped Pizza" You will experience a wide variety of choices on the menu all the food is fresh and the service is outstanding. Plenty of outside seating and a bar area with flat screen TVs. Greek is not always my first choice of food however this quality casual dining experience keeps me coming back. Opa!

I have eaten here several times most recently about a month ago.  They occasionally have a Pulled Pork Sandwich Special that is one of the best sandwiches of this type that I have ever had and that's saying a lot coming from an Iowa Hog Farmer.  IT SHOULD BE ON THE MENU THAT MIGHT GET UM 5 STARS.  Kinda funny but last time I was there we were sitting by the bar and the waiter accidentally hit the wall with the plate and dropped the hot sandwich on my leg and the floor.  I damn near chewed my leg off.  HaHa.  You could tell he was very embarrassed but there was no way I was leaving until I finished my delicious treat.  So I simply cleaned myself off and waited for the replacement.  The atmosphere is casual comfortable and dressy all at once so thats cool.  Great place to bring your significant other.  Highly Recommended.

The Middleton is always expensive but dam its good.  This is a great place to go for good music, great fish sandwiches and amazing bread pudding.  (make sure you ask them for a piece from the middle of the pan and extra sauce as these are the best pieces- very moist and delicious)  They often have live entertainment.  The patrons are very nice most of them professionals of some sort and the bartenders are great.  I like the atmosphere but whoever picked this location should have their head examined.  Its hard to find and the parking which is a small inconvenience for me is most likely a big deal for others who don't like to walk or stagger long distances.  Still highly recommended for a great Irish experience.

Simply first class everything when it comes to a Health Club and Spa.  All of the workout equipment is cutting edge along with the many other amenities including the classes.  Outside year round heated lap pools and water park for the children.  A full gymnasium in the childcare area is more room for your children to play in an athletic and healthy environment.  I love the fact that all of the water dispensers in each of the workout areas have fresh squeezed lemons to quench your thirst and cleanse your body.  When your finished with the workout retire to the steam room to relax and have a nice shave.  The cafe serves a diverse menu with everything from Salmon to wraps and they are all amazing fresh and delicious to the point that I often prefer to eat here than other local restaurants.  Top to bottom without doubt the finest quality health club in Arizona and a real testament to you get what you pay for.  Gotta go its gym time.

Yes I did it 5 Stars for a burger joint and without a bit of guilt.  This place rocks my wife makes me drive from our home on Shea and 130th Street to this location thats like 10 miles one way just for a burger.  Sometimes its fricken late as hell but I always deliver so I can get mine to if ya know what I mean.  Monster Style heck any style here is simply fantastic.  I love how they let you see into the kitchen.  Nothing to hide here not like the other joints.  This place is the pinnacle of clean from the parking lot to the kitchen.  The burgers are fresh the fries fresh cut right before your eyes.  In and Out is the best at what they do make delicious burgers and sell them to you at a price that makes you smile.  Get one, two maybe three its all good.  They are rapidly expanding and for good reason.  Please read this review and build one across the street from me.  Im sure that the Mayo Clinic will give you the land for free and Im sure I'll have to visit the Mayo in a couple months to have my arteries cleared so I can eat more of your delicious burgers.  Simply Fantastic.  A must on anyones Bucket List.

Below is my first review of this restaurant in which I raved about how good the Pizza was but after our second dining experience I have to give them 2 stars. Tonight the pizza crust was soggy and the flavors were only ok. The Chicago Meat Calzone was just nasty full of onions and again a soggy crust. What a shame as we were so excited to have found good pizza but if you cant be consistent you cant have my business. We wont go back and pay premium prices for anything less than perfection. This place offers no deals and sporadic quality.  MY FIRST REVIEW BELOW  We've had every type of crappy pizza you might imagine over the years so it was a great suprise when we ordered the spinach pizza and small calzone stuffed with spaghetti noodles, sausage and ricotta cheese. All of these items where bursting with flavor and for the first time since New York we could actually smell the garlic on the pizza. This pizza packs a flavor punch and I was out the door for under $25.00 with enough food to feed a family of four. I did take out for our first dining experience but now that they have set the hook we will return in short order for the in house treatment. So far highly recommended.  4/14/2012 THIRD REVIEW UPDATE- RAISED THEM FROM TWO BACK TO FOUR STARS.  My wife loves this Pizza otherwise I would have never went back to give them another chance but two visits later I am firmly convinced my bad experience was a fluke.  The Pizza has been excellent and full of flavor.

After 20 years of traveling around the world a five star review for an airline seems crazy to me but most recently I have been very impressed with Southwest.  The fairs are very reasonable almost certainly less in every case compared to the competition and with no hidden fees.  The free bags (your first 2) was also a huge part of the rating for this company.  On a recent flight with US Airways we paid more than $150.00 just for extra baggage fees to fly with them.  Goodbye US Airways you have lost our business forever.  Our last couple of flights to Vegas on Southwest we actually arrived ahead of schedule.    The open seating on Southwest was a little different however once we got used to it this was actually a great concept as everyone simply chooses the seat they want.  If seating is of great importance to you just get their a little early and you will have first choice of the entire plane.  Awsome.    Finally, a feature that I love with Southwest is that you can manage your own tickets online.  Example:  We bought tickets to fly to San Diego a couple months ago $151.00 round trip - great price and weren't able to make the flight.  I simply went online to my Southwest account and changed our reservations with absolutely no fees.  How cool is that.  I can simply book my own travel and make changes up to the day of departure with no additional fees or penalties.  We have done this a couple times and it actually works out great for Southwest because they done have to pay for employees to amend our schedules and in our case we actually upgraded our flight so everyone wins.    On time hassle free flights, very friendly staff, free bags, lowest fares, open seating and my own personal online management systems are all reasons this airline deserves the best rating available.  Damn good job Southwest.  See you soon.

Finding a FRESH Seafood Restaurant in Arizona can almost always be a chore so we were delighted when they presented us with a menu printed daily with a great selection of fish - shellfish etc.  We immediately got the party started with a selection of several oyster types harvested from Canada to Mexico and were amazed when they arrived super fresh and prepared correctly.  Very uncommon to get them so fresh without grit or shell pieces.  Without doubt the best we've have had in Arizona.  Im a Clam Chowder fanatic and I cant believe I'm saying this but this place had the best of anything I've tasted on either coast.  The chowder was filled with fresh clams not chunks of potato filler much appreciated!  Seems like we ordered one of everything and all of it was fantastic never experience a fishy smell or taste the entire meal the way fresh fish should be.  Nice atmosphere and a cool little pub area makes this place my favorite Fish House.  Prices are fair for this type of meal possibly a little steep for the Tempe Mall I would imagine they could triple their ROI with a location in North Scottsdale hint hint.  Anyway this place is well worth the 30 minute trip from our home and we will be back again soon.  Forgot to mention they have great craft packets to keep the kids busy at the table better than any other restaurant - our six and eight year old girls loved it.

The moment you walk in the door and hear Italian on the TV and those behind the counter speaking the same you get the feeling your food is going to taste as authentic as the people who prepare it- and it does.  We tried several items the pasta was great and the Big Beef Sandwich with sauteed onions also good.  The people who work here are very friendly and the service was fantastic.  They played with our girls who loved their bread and pasta and often giggled when the waiter joked with them.  We tried two deserts (dont know what they were) but they were also great.  We will be back soon.

My family loves the Pizza.  In fact my wife just left to go pick some up because they had a 1 1/2 hour wait for delivery on a Sat night.  No doubt because this crispy crust authentic New York style pizza is in high demand.  When we dine in the owner always takes time to talk with us.  They are kinda located in a horrible spot tucked back in the corner of a shopping center but once you find this place its worth it.  Prices are reasonable food is full of flavor and did I say I love the crust.  Highly recommended.

Lavender ice cream really?  It's amazingly refreshing one of my favorites.  Horchata, Huckleberry or Madagascar Vanilla if you will.  This place only uses the freshest ingredients many purchased from the Farmers Market right here in Scottsdale.  Great ingredients produce great ice cream and this place has the best I've tasted.  They where recognized by USA Today as one of the top 50 Ice Cream Parlors in the nation for good reason.  They always have a new amazing flavor or two in the rotation in case you've already tried the others.  Highly Recommended.  Try the turtle sunday - extra nuts and whipped cream.  Awesome.

Wow what a delicious burrito for the price. Im a Titanium Member at the Scottsdale Gun Club so I wondered by this place after shooting one day and ordered the Shredded Pork Burrito which I found to be loaded with flavor. The food is fresh and while the location is a little hard to find its worth it if you are looking for a good value and you love Carnitas or Fish Tacos.  The restaurant is small however the outdoor seating helps to accomadate the many folks who have heard about this little gem and keep returning much like myself.  I've been back a few times to try some of the other items and they are really good and most importantly fresh as well.  Recently, I visited for another round and the owner even remembered my name which was very impressive but most notable is that he really cares about the quality of food they put out here.  No hype just great food at fair prices.

We have been here several times with family and for the romantic dinner for two and found both experiences outstanding.  In Scottsdale we often forego inflated pricing for a sub par dining experience not so here.  While you will certainly pay top prices you will also get what you pay for.  Delicious steaks, sea food and interesting appetizers.  Did I say delicious I meant it!  Without doubt one of the best ribeye steak dinners in the valley cooked to perfection, tender and full of flavor and you can choose from 3 or 4 different topping schemes depending on your mood.  Fantastic decor great service need I say more.  If your in Cave Creek looking for a great meal search no further than Cartwrights.

Ordered a half rack of ribs with mac and cheese and combo sliders. They were out of pulled chicken so we ordered the bbq chicken. I thought the ribs were good as was the bbq chicken. The pulled pork was ok but the mac and cheese was very good served with big noodles. I like the layout with outside seating misters and picnic tables. Service was good prices reasonable. They only have one sauce but its a plus that they have it heated. I like my coleslaw chopped fine and thats the way they do it here but there was just a little to much vinegar taste for me. Once small complaint would be the parking situation which is very limited so we parked behind the shopping center but this is a small inconvenience for those who dont mind a walk. All in all a good dining experience.

We've had a family membership here for a couple years now and we love it.  Would do 5 Stars if they had a pool or other water related items but still gets a strong 4 Stars.  Not long ago they remodeled this location an added a boxing ring, new machines etc.  I have a VIP locker that I love they do my laundry daily and put clean towels, a bottle of water and a fresh mint in my locker each day all for about $1.25 per day.  They have 15 of these lockers located in their own special area with TV's nice leather benches etc.  The lockers are huge with push botton codes no locks.  The gym is always clean.  The child care is fantastic open 7 days a week my children love it.  They even have parents night out where you can bring your children for a couple hours on Friday night and go out while they do arts and crafts.  The juice bar has shakes with all natural ingredients and its almost always open.  The location is very convenient on Shea and 116th Street.  Theres a full size indoor basketball court and to many other amenities to list oh yea a dry heat sauna and my favorite the steam room.  Huge selection of weights and bikes.  If you live in the area this is the gym for you.

Ok this place is nice I wont dispute that and I expected it to be expensive but $98.00 for two adults and three kids to see an afternoon kids show almost pissed me off and set the stage for a bad experience.  The next issue is the food I was not impressed at all and when your charging me steak prices for sliders don't give me microwave burgers with no fries and the smallest sliders I've ever seen.  The place looks nice but so does the Studio Grill just down the road at half the price and much better food.  I may bring my wife here for an evening show to give them another chance but all in all very unimpressed with the experience.  Seats and ambiance is nice.

We religiously dine at several Oregano locations throughout the valley and love it however if you like Oreganos skip this location at all costs.  Horrible service, unorganized and unprofessional staff, music twice as loud as other locations and wait times for your food three times longer than other locations.  A real bummer no excuse all the other locations are just as busy or busier.  We had to wait until our pizza was cold and almost gone before we could get a servers attention to grate some cheese on it.  Other locations offer it immediatly when the pie hits your table.  We waited 45 minutes for salads and a pizza and then had to tell them which ingredients were missing.  If I owned this location I would sure notice that all other locations get 4+ stars and this place is below average with some terrible reviews wake up ownership wake up management this location is tarnishing your fine reputation!

The sandwich was a 2 Star disappointment and when you combine the price this place really earns the lowest rating.  I ordered the Medium Philly with mushrooms and hots on the side along with a small drink- $13.50 what a rip off. (I didnt even get a side or chips what would that have been $15.+) These sandwiches don't even make the average persons top 100 so the sign sets you up for a big let down.  This business should do themselves a favor and remove this blatantly false advertising.  Even a fast food joint like Arbys and their $5.00 Philly is much better.  First time I've wanted to go back and tell them to their faces how below average they really are but its not the folks working hard behind the counters fault so Ill just leave it here.  Save your dime and try almost any other sammie for a better experience.

This place really has some interesting appetizers and outstanding pizza also with amazing taste combos not commenly found on your traditional pie.  I agree with Kristin the Fig-Sambucca is simply outstanding.  The price, decor and layout of the restaurant is ok which holds them back from a 5 star however if you are looking for great pizza experience in North Scottsdale give this place a try you wont be disappointed.

I've been bringing the wife and kids here religiously 2-3 times a week since they opened for two reasons it's one of the only breakfast joints near Troon where we live and the pancakes are great.  Over time we have made friends with the servers and they do a great job for us.  We really liked this place and highly recommended it to all our friends until now.  We have noticed a slip in food quality and a massive price increase.  The owner has been making huge revenues off an already pricy breakfast menu and sometimes to many customers.  Apparently the greedy woman doesn't appreciate her customers she just printed a new menu and raised prices for an omelet to $13.00.  Hence a breakfast bill for us of $114.00.  Hope she buys something nice with that because this is the last time we ever come here.  Congratulations you just lost several thousand dollars in revenue from us as we easily spend more than 700.00 per month here now.  $8000.00 plus annually nice job pencil that and this review into your bottom line.  Do you think your customers are idiots the cost of eggs, bread, pankakes, is almost nothing compared to the bill.  FYI your food is good but not that great it's fricken breakfast and we had runny eggs and a messed up order today to go with our huge bill.  We are immediately telling all our friends to boycott your business.

I have been here once with my family and a couple times with friends and enjoyed myself each time.  The beers are cold you can order the "MAN" size or "girl" size (nice marketing ploy)  The food was better than I had anticipated with large portions and full of flavor.  The only minor complaint I had was a Taco Plate that we sent back twice then gave up because it came out with cold meat so the cheese didn't melt.  The waitress appeared to get irritated with us even though we told her the rest of the food was great.  Oh well a minor incident compared to the remaining experience.  I really like the TV's in the booths and the bathroom so you don't miss a play.  The waitresses have always been alot of fun, they are knowledgeable about the menu simply stunning and willing to take a photo if you wish.  I find no issues with their outfits these woman are beautiful and certainly clothed with more than you would see at the pool.  This is a fun place for lunch just get there at 11am or anticipate a wait.  My colleagues and  I prefer to sit at the bar. (Views)  I look forward to a couple Sat - Sun football games this year as this place has more to offer than most.  Very clean and fun atmosphere.  Nice addition to the neighborhood.

Hip Hip Hooray for the Tom's Thumb Car Wash and dining experience.  Yes 5 big ones for a company with a lame name and less than favorable location.  We've lived in the area for years and unfortunately never ventured into this wonderful little bistro.  Food is simply outstanding hands down some of the best BBQ in this town.  Excellent Fresh Pulled Pork and brisket.  Ive been here 10 times since we found out about them a month ago.  Great Service and staff very nice market with some of the finer selections you might only find at AJ's.  My wife and I have had our cars through the wash every week and each time its a job well done.  Great excuse for me to sit and eat.  Oh did I mention they also have a coffee bar with amazing cupcakes.  Breakfast Lunch or Dinner make time for this place you will be glad you did.  Special thanks to the owner for putting together such a nice establishment.  Additional thanks to the chef for her outstanding approach to a variety of dishes recently voted one of the top 25 new restaurants in the valley.

Blah blah blah what's all the hype about.  Ordered the grilled corn it was cooked perfectly with just enough sauce to piss you off.  Anyone with common sense would serve it with a side of sauce or at least more than the tiny squirt they give you.  Ordered the $18.00 taco plate each taco graciously stuffed with a full tablespoon of meat- what a joke.  Our food was cold and nats where constantly landing in our salsa bowls.  The server Sandra did an excellent job and you can tell she truly believes in the food unfortunately it's overpriced for the portions and lacking flavor and temperature.  There are many other Mexican food places I would visit prior to a return here.  Service and atmosphere are excellent minus the bugs food is C-.  The  couple sitting next to us ordered a sandwich to share the each took one bite  commented on how bad it was and left.  The Carne Asada Tacos had decent flavor and had its moments but nearly every bite was interrupted by a hard piece of chewy fat or something nasty.
