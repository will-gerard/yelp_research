The White Widow is my go to here, chicken with ranch, mushrooms, provolone, and lightly toasted. The atmosphere is new age reggie (american version) which is a fun change in the usual sub sandwich interior. Some of the murals and art work are a little risqu√© for younger eyes and may have some suggested themes but for the college scene it fits right in. Overall I like the food and service is always friendly.

We were seated immediately which was great but thats when the pleasantries started to tamper off. Our waitress was very absent minded and quick to leave our table. The complimentary chips and dips were not fresh and the bean dip was very cold. It took several attempts to get our drink order filled. I finally had to ask one of the bussers for new dips and an more water. He helped immediately where as our server was non existent.  Food was ok, kinda pricey for the quantity but I am not planning a return anytime soon.

I have gone to Ted's many times now and each time I get the foot long hot dog with classic fixings. This time around I tried the double burger, it was good, a typical homemade style burger, but Ted's really shines with their hot dogs/bratwursts.  The onion rings are hand made and are the prefect form of flaky that the don't feel like I'm eating a pound of grease. The fries are delicious and when salted a little and paired with a rich, cold ketchup, you can't go wrong. The only downside is that the lines are really long everytime I have gone, but I guess thats what you have to deal with when everyone wants to eat at Ted's.

Came here to have a good night with friends and family, after what was supposed to be a relaxing evening, turned into an ordeal. I previously won a $50 gift card from a charity event supporting a young child needing a transplant. When I went to use this gift card, the manager came out and said this card is not valid since I could not produce a receipt for the said purchased card that was won from a raffle. Even after I showed him the legitimate raffle event's website and contacted the event staffs coordinator, the card was only honored for half the valued price. The manager even admitted that there was record of the card being activated in their system and yet would not honor it. Over all I do not plan on making a return.

Really friendly staff, after my previous PCP retired I was recommended to Dr. Coury and have not been disappointed. As of now I am happy with this practice and do not intend on leaving anytime in the near future.

This is the place to get authentic tamales at a great price! The service staff is really friendly and the owner is very talkative and willing to help out with anything you need. Definitely ask for his green salsa, it is delicious with a great hot spice to it!!

The staff is really friendly and always willing to help out with your order. I have been here quite a few times and each sub is worth trying. Today I got the Mother Lode and it was perfect, tons of meat and veggies. Worth trying over the subway craze.

The food here is really good, it is a little pricey, $9.50 for just the pasties without any sides. However the pasties are a good size and usually fill me up. I suggest the Peppered Steak, it is by far my favorite so far. The service gets kinda slacked as the place fills up. Seems like the servers are more interested in the big parties with a high bar bill. All in all its a decent place, the atmosphere is very chill and a little dark. Definitely has the pub feel.

So I have been here twice now and both times I got a burrito. I can't remember the which kind I ate the first time but the second time I got the Surf & Turf burrito. THAT thing is a beast filled with steak and shrimp, as well as your usual interior fillings. The burritos here are so large that it is really hard to eat the whole thing plus any chips or drink. They are decently priced, I think my burrito came to a total of $9-$10 which isn't terrible since it filled me up to the brink. The staff seems friendly and the owner likes to drop in and make suggestions to people in line which is a nice touch. I definitely plan on going back when I'm on that side of town again. Just dont go in there and expect to eat light.

This is my second time here, I tried the 'Pad Thai' this time and it was a little salty but still pretty good. They serve a small soup and egg roll as a complimentary appetizer, which the egg roll tastes awesome and I really wish they gave you two. After the meal is done Im always pretty stuffed. Plan at least a 45 min meal time when going with a few people.

Went here for late night dinner, they close at 10pm and I got there at 9:40pm and they locked the door as I walked up even with customers eating inside. An employee motioned me to go to the drive thru, which I did and I should have just kept driving. When I went to order the drive thru employee was barely paying attention. I had to repeat my order 3 times before she finally repeated my order correctly. She told me she would give me my total at the window. Once I got there she asked me to wait because she hadn't even put my order in yet....after waiting another 5 mins she came back and told me the things I ordered weren't being made anymore and that I had to order something else. Placed my new order and waited another 5 mins for her to come back with a soaking wet box covered with sauce. Once home, the food was overcooked and the portions were way smaller then I have ever seen from a Panda Express. My beef and broccoli was 90% broccoli with dry "beef". I'm never going back to this location and it has severely ruined my chance at ever trying Panda Express again.

All I can say is 'food coma' and its 100% positive! Wasn't sure what to expect when I walked up to the restaurant's door but believe me the food is amazing. Serving size is larger than most for the price range so order the half sandwich if you are new to the place and go up from there. Will be returning in the future.

The fish tacos are awesome! Great size and on Tuesdays the prices cant be beat. Shared a plate of 12 wings with a coworker and had 2 fish tacos myself and the bill was less then $10. Get the fish tacos with breaded finish on either the flour or corn tortillas, both are good.

Really good pizza joint, since its right next to my house, it makes a great option. The pizza  slice is huge and the wings are tasty, I get the special #2 and that fills me up everytime!

Absolutely astounding venue for both weddings and social gatherings! The staff here is both friendly and informative. The grounds are beautiful and full of adventure. Watch out for the smaller donkey, he is friendly but if you pet him, he wont let you stop. Even if that means a friendly nip! I am a dark wine fellow, I like bold taste. So if you like smokey wine, try the Dutchman's Bold, it'll give you hair on your chest. Over all I recommend the experience of driving down, trying the wines, and asking Karen for a history lesson. She is the pretty one with the golden hair.

Always a good choice for some delicious food! Been coming here for the past year and a half, never once have I been disappointed. It does get pretty busy around lunch so plan ahead when going for a work day run.

Went to the Mesa location off of Alma School and Guadalupe, it was a little tucked away but is view-able from Guadalupe. This was my first time at this place and I wasn't sure what to expect. The exterior is a little bland which worked I think because the interior is definitely the exact opposite. The atmosphere has that New Orleans vibe and has the music and walls to enforce it. We were sat down immediately got a seat right near the kitchen so we got to see all the food coming out and the smells that come with them. The wait staff was friendly and they helped explain the menu to us which isn't complicated but with trying to absorb all of my surroundings, I need some explanation. Basically it was choose your food, choose the seasonings, choose the spice level, and then add some extra fillings like sausage, corn, or potatoes. I got a pound of shrimp with the trifecta seasonings and medium spice level with a sausage thrown in. The food comes out in a clear bag and a metal bucket, you put on your provided bib and then eat right out of the bag! IT was awesome and the food was amazing. I have never had to rip the heads off my shrimp before to eat them but it was an experience I will not forget. I plan on returning and trying the other food items on the menu. Plus being able to draw on the walls added a nice final touch.
