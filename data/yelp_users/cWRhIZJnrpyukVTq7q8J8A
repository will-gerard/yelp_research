First time here.  Great decor and atmosphere.  Loved the building.  Unfortunately, the food was a disappointment.  Not bad, just not great and certainly not worthy of the bill.  My food came out not that hot.  Meat was a little tough.  And the mashed potatoes were cold  My date's food was hot but not cooked to her specification.  Service was very slow.  Did not get our food out for almost 30 minutes.  First visit and probably my last.  Would not recommend this place.  Much better choices for the money.

Went there last night and had a lobster/crab boil.  Fantastic.  Reminded me of my days back home in South Mississippi.  Just like I would have cooked it.  Anyone from the deep south will love this place.  Just need to find a place to put a pier in.
