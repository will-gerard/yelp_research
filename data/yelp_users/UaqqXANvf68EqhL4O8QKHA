Never been lied to by a salon before until today. I felt pretty betrayed here being my first time in. I had asked a question regarding the "dazzle dry " cuz i usually get shellac gels, and dazzle dry  claims to last 2 weeks and dry fast, like shellac but more "organic" ... all sales scheme. Dazzle dry is $18, and shellac was $25. I was going to try dazzle. They knew i had gel polish half on, and i needed to get back to work so i wanted to make sure the dazzle dry was the same outcome,they assured me it was... at the end of a so so manicure, using regular opi polish, she said dry 5 min, i waited 10,  go to pay and she says $22 !! I said why is it $5 higher, she said to take off the gel polish?! I chewed most of it off, and she never lotioned up my finger tips after harsh acetone nor did she trim my cuticles !! So she really didn't do a full regular manicure, let alone a 22 dollar one that messes up as soon as i got my card to pay her !! So much for dazzle being anything like gel...sure did cost the same. Bad customer service. Its so close to where i live,i was hoping to be a regular,but that was a very poor first experience. :( hate having crappy dry hands n nails !

I have been a member 2 different times here and am pleased.  It is up to the members to clean up after themselves...face it.most of humanity is lazy which is gross,so jus wipe down equipment  before and after use...perfect pricing, especially when they have such awesone classes like yoga, zumba, spin etc etc!

My mom and I have come in for lunches a few times, always seem to land on Wednesdays....and every time we have been pleased, and very thankful this was a good Indian lunch option close to home, but we had to let you know about our last time there... We know what restaurant owner expectations are for servers,cooks ,bartenders, food runners,etc...and this one we thought the owner should know... A pleasant american girl was our server, but where it went unpleasant was her descriptions of the food...  We usually get a veggie dish and a chicken dish, we never heard of what these particular dishes were on this lunch special day, so we asked her to described it.. 1st thing she said is, the veggie dish was just peas,carrots,and looked like vomit, she claim to only like all the chicken dishes they  are all good... My mom and I couldn't believe she was calling the chefs food vomit, that's actually all we could think of, we got our dishes,(1 chicken,1 veggie ) and although it didn't taste bad, our hunger was turned off, and we no longer could eat, so my mom and I basically paid $25 for our chai . We needed the check ,couldnt  find her so i come to find her texting on her phone...what a pet peeve to have that kind of employee, phone usage shouldn't be in the public's eye...but maybe its a more laid back environment, but we weren't getting proper service. So needless to say, we did not enjoy that time at all and felt like we wasted our money that day.

I wanted to like this venue since Phoenix has limited venue/music options....but each experience of the pressroom i had came off to be extremely disappointing with a very unprofessional" manager",michelle ,weak staff, over priced drinks, ghetto parking scenario,so so sound quality etc.... with what limited options there are in phx...id go to any venue over the pressroom

Great service and the food @ this location has always been spot on...different story on other locations!  I think lyndsey was a server of mine a few times and was always on target with every step of service on all her tables i saw. Great bartender/manager too!
