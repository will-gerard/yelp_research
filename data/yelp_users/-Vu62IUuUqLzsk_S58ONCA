Got food poisoning from a hash brown! Threw up all over the rest of my dinner, carpet and entertainment center  after a 12 hour work day, they did not care about my repeat business or if I was ok just offered to give me a free hash brown which in my eyes was unexceptable. Now after a week they finally get back to me and now I'm waiting for there insurance company to call me, they made a claim, like I'm a liar and making up a story for free mcdonalds hahahaha haha ??? Lol unreal, weird and rediculous !! They have some odd policies and will no longer earn my business.

what a joke!!! Massage envy is the biggest waste of your time and money!! The Manager at this location is an immature piece of garbage that has no idea how to do her job. Received a year membership as a gift, I should of re gifted it to a homeless person.

You have to go talk to these guys and see what great products and information they have for you!
