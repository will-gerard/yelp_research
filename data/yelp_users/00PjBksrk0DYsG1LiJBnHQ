First found Roy's in Maui and then on Kauai, and then... WOW... Phoenix. Always enjoyed the one in Scottsdale and the one here at the Marriott is closer and great. Almost a feeling of Hawaii.. but not. Food is always great, the service is professional and the best. And now at the Marriott in San Diego on the Bay...great outdoor patio, drinks and food.

Had to write another round of kudos for this great chain.   One might think that now being affiliated with the Outback Steakhouse Group would diminish it's dedication to quality - WRONG. The chef, the people, the quality and service.. ALL THERE. And.... it's not just Sushi :-)  I've written about this and other locations before but the consistency is there and it's always a great experience. This time it was the perfect night to sit on the patio and enjoy a couple drinks, some wine, a great dinner and great AZ weather.  The hanger steak was perfect, but what has always made Roy's the tasty experience you want is.. the sauces. They must have spent decades (OK maybe hours) making these sauces that add so much to everything they serve.  With that in mind, the Asian pork ribs for an appetizer were THE BEST. When i was in San Diego a few weeks ago we ate there and they were nice enough to make the appetizer portion into a dinner for me - WOW... i love those ribs. My client had the crusted Mahi Mahi (also my dad's fav) and it didn't disappoint - cooked perfect and again, the sauce reduced enough for flavor but didn't overwhelm.  The drinks are great, even their own house wines are good for the price. (Hey, after a couple great Mai Tais who needs a $20 glass of wine?)  The only issue this trip was that the Chocolate Souffle lacked that yummy runny explosion of chocolate sauce when you break it open BUT... seeing that, our waiter insisted on a new one for us. Hence.... 5 stars.  The service was professional and knowledgeable as usual and it's a pleasure to go somewhere once in a while where the waiters aren't "almost helping you" in between texts and meaningless chatter with the dishwasher.  Their reservation system actually works and automatically applies any promotional discounts to your bill. Nice to see efficiency.  Bravo again to Roy and his well trained people and well conceived concept. Try any of their locations and there's a 99.8% chance you won't be disappointed.  How do you say Bon Appetite in Hawaiian? (Roy's i guess)  http://www.roysrestaurant.com/index.asp   (PS - I don't work there... I just love the place)  :-)

This is a great place. For a chain it has a good mix of quality food, well made drinks by Angela, and an atmosphere that's clean and inviting. Angela is a terrific bartender. Makes excellent drinks, with excellent service, is personable, and makes our business meetings go smoothly. Stop by, ask for Angela and enjoy the best experience ever. (Food is great too)   The Asian Chicken Lettuce wraps (with a terrific authentic cucumber salsa), the chicken tenders with a spice southwest sauce, the chips and dips, and sliders.... a great compliment AND... their potato skins with their chicken or crispy bacon.....  :-)  The management here cares about what goes out. And happy hour prices are terrific with some good savings on drinks and food.  Been to many of their locations in various states but the one on Mayo and Scottsdale Rd in Scottsdale... the best!  Don't miss this chance to relax and enjoy. Really.  Have i ever steered you wrong? Don't think so.

It seems they are closing many locations which is a shame as they've been a standard for decades. Good luck everyone in the reaming locations.

Friends and i thought.. let's go somewhere different and try a place we haven't been in years. We broke down and went to the patio. It's expanded some with outdoor seating (thank goodness the weather has cooled) but other than that.. a place we could have done without.  The drinks? ok. The appetizer? Let me tell you. there were three of us so we got the combo (2 of the above thing) $5.75 for three onion rings and 3 stuffed jalapenos that can you get for $5 a bag. Absurd. $1 a piece for an onion ring? Give me a BBQ break.  The salad? a small bowl. The steak? about 1/3 "  thick (almost more like a flat iron steak) and the beans... moderately warm. The 1/4 chicken (thigh and small wing) was at least cooked ok. But it must have been a small chicken.  For the money? A waste. It is probably a great place for tourists but for locals looking for good food, reasonable pricing and value? Skip it and make your way to the Frog on Bell or some other place selling BBQ and decent food.  I try not to be overly critical knowing a place has to turn a profit but what you get for your money is still important. I judge a place by asking my self a question when i leave - "would i come back again and why?" The answer here... Not for a long long time. A LOOOONG time.

Started going to CJ years ago in California. It was ALWAYS known for good food and lots of it. You could count on taking some home and... that was always the plan.  I've been to this one in Phoenix three times in the couple months for meetings and have to say... I doubt a return trip is in the works. The menu wasn't as big and exciting, the portions have gotten smaller, the pricing was the same or slightly higher meaning the value wasn't there AND.... sorry but i love my chicken pot pie but NOT when the inside crust is still uncooked.   Sure, some big pieces of chicken but for the money... I should have gotten a couple whole ones to go. Seasoning was so-so and overall, just another mediocre third visit.  Also, the clam chowder (something that was always on my must have list) was thick and "chalky" and tasted more of unincorporated flour or something. Yes, there were clams but... the rest of it wasn't worth the effort. Thank God for the hot sauce.  I should have taken the hint from my other visits and gone to the Macaroni Grill next door. Sorry Landry's..... not what it used to be.

We used to go here a lot years ago. But a move north a bit took it out of the flight path so... it was time to go back and check it out.  As always.... the owner/bartender/waiter/janitor/greeter was doing his thing running around and keeping us in drinks and food.  The drinks were good a always (no short pours here that i've had) and the food great. i didn't have but the burgers were big and juicy looking and the salad with cajun chicken was great. BEST honey mustard dressing i ever had.  Anyhow, glad i went and will be back sooner. It's small, with 6 tables and the 10 seat bar but... close friends and fun can be found here.  ENJOY IT.... and worth the trip for this small almost out of the way place.  I'd give it 5 stars but it was a bit noise (part of the charm except when you're trying to talk) and our waitress could have been better looking.  :-)  (sorry John)

I first wandered into The Keg up in Vancouver, BC. it was a lazy rainy afternoon and i thought with a name like this it might be a casual beer bar to relax for a bit.... SURPRISE. Even in the afternoon it was clean, good staff, and even a simple appetizer was done right.  A couple weeks ago here in Phoenix i was looking for a nice place for dinner and having remembered they had one down the street thought i should try it. Glad i did.  It was one of those nights i thought i should try a couple different things so, loving prime rib, they had an end cut so that was the plan. Being a sucker for a good special i added the crab legs. Add in the mashed potatoes (chunky enough so you know they didn't come from a box) and veggies and it was a meal fit for a diplomat.  The one thing I always forget is that crab legs take so much time to open and eat that the meat gets cold but... that yummie warm butter. The horseradish was real and HOT and a great compliment. The prime rib had enough crust ( i hate semi-raw meat) to make it well cooked and yet not dried out and the seasoning was just right.  The service was spectacular with an actual manager making the rounds and several wait staff overseeing every detail.  It's not a cheap place but not at the top of the scale either so it won't be a weekly visit but they have some great happy hour deals and it's worth any special occasion outing.  Great good, terrific service, clean setting with professional comfortable decor. What more could you ask for. As Arnold would say... "I'll be baaaack" and will enjoy this  place again I'm sure.

After using this valuable resource for years, it's time I came here and made sure everyone knew my thoughts. In our 44 years in business, we've never had such a great production partner.  Every production project is different requiring different assets. Different cameras, lighting configurations, audio, jibs, monitoring and accessory equipment. Oz and his team of pros have always been there for the production community.  We've used their cameras, switchers, lighting, audio, and just about everything else in five states and it's always worked. They maintain things well and their people always have the input to make sure a job is completely covered.  Whether people have some of their own gear and need supplements, or a project calls for everything to be sourced, this IS the place pros need to consider. With changing technologies and varying projects, it's almost impossible for any one group to keep everything in house for every conceivable job. BR makes it possible.  Thanks to Oz, Earl, Jack, Robert, Marsha, Deb and the others who make it happen for all of us.  Ron Production Services/AZ

What can one guy say? The reviews here say it all. I actually told Mike (who is a great customer service rep) that i wish i had more car problems so i could come back more often. I had found them years ago but my car runs great with no needs,  but... this time wanted some preventative work done. I called, Made an appt. and he quoted about $129 for the work. (WHICH WAS FAIR given most prices for the same work and MORE THAN FAIR considering my dealer wanted to "knock it out around $250" - their words). I got the bill.... $117. I like paying less. But it's the attitude, the care, the "we want to make you happy" approach to customers here.  I had a coupon for an oil change from my dealer (whom i will NEVER go to again). Go anywhere and an oil change is $20-30. So i figured i had it ok with a $25 credit from dealer. (ok, It's PInnacle Nissan). I got the oil changed, gave them my coupon and THEY STILL WANTED ANOTHER $27 - cause their OC is now $45.00. Wilhelm.... normally $29 and they have specials as well.  These guys are just professionals and worth your business. Since 1928?  Really? There's a reason people.

This place was good in it's day but has closed and now REOPENED down on Bell Rd in Phoenix. Great food, terrific drinks and nice people. The same original good food in a  new place. give it a try - you'll enjoy as much as we do. It's a weekly place for us.

I've tried this place over the last couple of years. And, having moved within about a minute of the place was hoping that my last couple of visits would be improved upon but... to no avail.   This place still suffers from lack of real professional food management in several areas. The food still ranks a 3-4 on the 1-10 yummie scale. The drinks are about 3% alcohol and 97% mix.  And of course it always turns me off when you stick to the dried "something" on the vinyl seats or sit down to a dirty table. The staff definitely needs better training in clearing a table.  I tried this place twice since moving down the street in hopes that it could become a new hangout. WRONG. For dinner, the Mai Tai was literally 99% pineapple juice and maybe, MAYBE they sat it next to the rum for a minute but beyond that... not a well made drink. Probably made it a "virgin" for a 9 year old or something.  The fish and chips were miserable. The batter on the fish was not light and  crispy but spongy and burned tasting - as if the oil was last changed for the New Year's party seven months ago. The "chips" were some thin product made of potatoes but were tasteless and limp from the same bad grease.  The waitresses (we had two for some reason so one must have been in training although both seemed just as incompetent) were dressed in some weird combination of bad party wear and beach rejects. Quality places should have some sort of professional dress code to maintain the overall image of the concept, not a fashion free for all - even in casual places.  I'm no snob and have eaten in 5 stars and dives from Hawaii to Maine but... i like to feel like the food was actually prepared by someone who could at least spell food and served with some fun and care. I like the food to be tasty and resemble the type of concept i'm visiting and worth the money i'm spending - no matter how much.  i might give this place one more try but the last three visits have yielded the same mediocre experiences... after all... desperate people do desperate things.

I give up.  A friend suggested meeting here for lunch this week. I reluctantly said yes. We were the first ones in. We went to the right and up the few steps to find a table. EVERYONE had dirty chairs and tables with crumbs, obviously from the night before. If i was desperate, there might have been enough food around to make a meal.  After looking at each other we decided to try one of the high tops down in the bar area. OK, the chairs were clean and the table top looked clean so we sat. Since there were two of us at a four place, i went to move the salt and pepper out of the way. Not an easy chore since the salt was stuck to the table. Breaking it loose and moving on to move the small appetizer plates, they were stacked for four.  The top three slide off, the bottom one stuck to the table. The table had that sticky "someone almost tried to clean it off" feeling to it.  To the waitress' credit, after mentioning the upper chairs and tables she got a towel and went to clean them off after telling us it must have been the night crew's mistake - WELL DUH!  Again, there's no management at this place. If they would clean up, improve the inconsistent food and get it together, they might do more biz. Maybe they need to call in Restaurant Impossible, OR... just ask their customers. We could all tell them a few things... those of us that care.  As a note, it was my friend's first time there wanting to try it. She said she'd never be back. . Maybe my standards for cleanliness and good food are higher than some others but... I always tell it like i see it.   ...I give up, I'm done with this hole

Want to impress someone? Want to waste money on small portions? Want a fru fru dinner with orchid leaves, cactus petals and baby carrots? This is the place. Otherwise... head down the street for larger, reasonable, normal portions, good food and less pretension.  I like to go out and EAT, not see how much money i can spend and still be hungry.

I used to come here a lot. Good food and drinks.  BUT..................  For whatever reason this place is taking the "I'll overcharge and under-deliver" approach to profits. Shame for such a large chain.  When fajitas first came on the scene years ago, they were tasty, spicy and peppery. A real taste sensation. Something different. Well. maybe unbeknownst to me they are going through another change cause these beef ones were terrible. The spiciness of baby food. And onions? Yes, green peppers... i might have seen one and no red to be found.   We got one order with extra beef to share. There were enough black beans for maybe one good taco - not two people sharing. The rice was....just rice. No seasoning, none of the extra elements they usually add to Mexican rice like carrot slivers, peas or chilies. Again, no flavor.  For the Guac and sour cream, again, maybe enough for a Taco Bell taco but NOT for a place like this. I'm thinking a 1 oz (maybe a 2 oz) scoop at the most.  For $18 (plus $3 for the extra beef? WHERE'S THE BEEF?) there should have been a better meal and less disappointment. Hey...it's mostly starchy beans, rice and tortillas so $50 a pound for the beef seems a bit stiff. I'm not demanding when i go out but there's a limit to how much charity I'm willing to give out when i dine.  THEN... i got home and saw the itemized bill. WOW..... We had four HOUSE margaritas. Maybe it's been a while since I've had a house 'rita but we paid $32 for four of them. $32! I could have bought a nice Patrón or enough Casa Herradura to do the trick for $32. $8 a piece for what was watered down lime juice on ice should be an embarrassment to this company. Sacrificing customer satisfaction and loyalty for the price of a few drinks.....sad.  One small element of our visit was that there was a larger party. With the poor acoustics in the room, it was extremely loud for a nicer dining venue AND our waiter spoke in such a heavy Mexican accent, all combined... tough to communicate. Management of a quality place needs to keep on top of a lot of things and this place...doesn't.  Bottom line.... I think not. Can't imagine when I'll go back as there are too many options in the Mexican food category. Save your time, money and appetite for somewhere who will appreciate your business. There were too many things wrong with this visit to make it worth a repeat performance.  Hasta luego baby - nunca

ALWAYS enjoy this place even before it moved but... the noise is unbearable sometimes. can't even carry on a close conversation and it's definately NOT an intimate setting but.. the hot and sour soup... GREAT and the food has always been terrific. Pretty fast service and the prices pretty fair. Again, I'd give it 43 stars except for the noise. Better than their other locations too.

Got to say that Deb and Dave are putting out 200% effort to make this good. I went to the original Frog in Cave Creek since it opened in the 80s. They worked there for years and got it right when they opened this place.  The drinks are well made (ask for the Bloody Frog), the BBQ terrific, the beans, fried chicken (WOW), everything has always been good when I've gone AND.. you've got to try the sandwiches. The Wild turkey sandwich with Jalapeno bacon, the torpedo, and patty melt. How does this place do everything right? They've got specials, great prices, salads, and great desserts.  The old place was nice but this i might like even better cause it's smaller and more "neighborhoodie". They got tons of screens for sports and the people are super. It's a weekly stop for us and it's worth it. Great value too.  DISCLAIMER - No, I don't work there but wish i did. Then maybe i could eat for free. THANKS for opening this place again.

i needed my BBQ fix so.. to the Frog it was. The drinks continue to be made well, the service great and the BBQ (OK, and a bite of my friend's sandwich) was the best. I love the sauce, the beans are always great as was the taters and gravy. I do love going back to this place as it's not a chain, owners that care, a staff that's into serving people and with enough TVs to watch any game and relax in a smaller setting. Could become a regular.  :-)

This is a cool place to relax on the patio upstairs, and they always have GREAT music. Chuck Hall on Thursdays and one and two piece groups other nights - sweet. The bbq aint bad (nice sauce), the salmon has been good and the drinks nice. Great burgers. Not a fan of the small tacos but everyting is good. The upsairs is best with open air and fun times even though the downstairs is nice it looks more like something out of Dungeons and Dragons. Go, relax and enjoy.

I really REALLY wanted to like this place. There's 3-4 of us that go out every Friday afternoon for some drinks and apps. With more and more places closing or getting worse this place was close, looks nice and in general is not a totally bad place.  We went a couple times and things were pretty good. Nice patio and good happy hour.  We went a week ago and my friend and i had our normal Long Island Ice Teas. Now, I've had them from Hawaii to NYC and when they're made right, they're refreshing and nice., When they're made bad...the WORST drink on Earth.  One sip and we both gagged, looked at each other and did the Ug dance. I took them back to the guy and my friend played it safe with some scotch and I thought I'd try a margarita. DUMB MOVE Ron. The bartender kid said they didn't do a lot of cocktail biz so they had no Grande Marnier and he said they squeezed their own limes.  Now, the margarita is the most popular drink in America so you'd think people could make it right - especially in Arizona. Not so. I knew the taste I was tasting but put my thoughts on hold. This time the food scored a 6 with the chips limp and greasy (actually dripping) and needed a replacement.  We decided to give this one more try this last week. I made the same mistake of ordering a Rita. When i asked the waitress/bartender (after another bad drink) it turns out the kid last week wasn't even a bartender... AND YET HE'S MAKING A COMPLICATED LONG ISLAND? And... turns out my taste buds were correct.. they use Pope's lime - Not fresh. Pope's is the worst with that weird heavy aftertaste that is as fake a the lemon and lime juice you buy in the store in the plastic fruits.  If you're going to run a place and invest the money and time, USE FRESH QUALITY INGREDIENTS.  I don't think i'm asking too much.  So many places are cutting corners, lacking service, poor food...they must think the public will put up with anything to drink and eat out. NOT SO. Fill up your bar with some good stock, Make your own sour mix, teach your waiters NOT to be a bartender and get some consistent food coming out from the back. There's too many options when eating out to go to places that don't care enough.  Again... just keeping it real.

Robert did it again. Took me a while to get time to get here but... The passion and love of the Fork has made it to north Scottsdale. Great food, terrific drinks and while not as rustic, a clean comfy place good for dinner and drinks that matches anything... and you know the food will be terrific. Got to be a regualr stop on the culinary highway for me!

It's been over a year since i had a chance to write a note even though a few visits in between exposed me to the yummies at Renegade. In a quick meeting with a business associate there last week  I was again inclined to delve into the depths of some green chili pork stew. Since Robert has moved on to new adventures i wanted to see if the integrity of this Roaring Fork staple was in tact - IT WAS.   The pork was well cooked and substantial without being mushy or stringy, the subtle heat and spice of the green chilis was just right with a bit of peppery taste and over all.. a great reminder of what i love about this place. And it was a great compliment and opposition to the glass of wine.  I would have given this a good five stars for the pork and the memories but the staff seemed a bit less attentive.  Even though i got there early without any crowd, I sat for some time before I was recognized and the wine order was taken. Other than that... it was the same ol Renegade and Robert would have been proud. Can't wait to try his new place in Scottsdale.

Got to say this place has become a loser. the food has been bad every time we've tried it - Hey... a Ruben with no 1,000 island? fake onions rings made of mushy onion paste? A bartender that can't get more than one drink at a a time? bbq that's dried out and re-fried beans with NO taste? Sorry but other places deserve my money more. Not trying to be overly critical - just real. Too many options when dining out these days.

I've been passing this place for years and since i love Thai food, i thought finally, a chance to try it out.  Now I know it's hard to bash a place that has multiple locations and been around awhile so maybe it was an off night but... the crazed anticipation i was experiencing was replaced with a really mediocre meal.  I LOVE great hot and sour soup. The spiciness, the heat, the mixed flavors of spices and veggies and meat, the texture which is smooth yet lingers....but $10 for 30 ounces of blandness wasn't my goal. That's $42 a gallon for what was basically peppery water laced with too many HUGE pieces of tomato and mushrooms with a very few pieces of meat. It was not a great hot and sour soup and was more a tomato chunk laden broth. I've got to say that Flo's still makes the best  And I was ready to sink my teeth into their "Signature Dish" as again, Thai food is supposed to be bold and exciting and an experience to be remembered long after leaving the table. And... your signature dish should represent your finest effort.  I'm guessing that the person who developed this "Signature" dish couldn't write. It was really bland, without character, without any punch and the pork was chewy and bereft of any sense of culinary fun and quality. Really... a signature dish?   And realizing there are some spices used that have remaining elements, the amount of twigs and roughage in this was most interesting. The menu forgot to tell me that it came with its own toothpicks.  Anyhow, I never want to be unfair and there may, MAY, be a second chance for this place but in reading other reviews i see I'm not alone in the evaluation of my "blandness" meter. Anyone can have an off night but there seems to have been several in the recent past.  Living in Cave Creek and enjoying some time and wine next door makes this place convenient but... with one more visit to be fair....if it doesn't make then i'll be scratching this off my "got to" list as well.  There are too many food choices in town including other Thai and great Chinese to spend time and money where it goes into some R&D and quality ingredients.

It's not your mama's 99 cent burger but then again... it's worth more.  Everyone's been raving about Culvers, so passing it on the way home i was drawn in by the crowds and a quick trip through the drive thru made me a fan.  I'd give it 5 stars but i wasn't slammed with the custard but... maybe on another day or mine was too small to get into it. The burger though was an awesome treat. Those buttered buns and fresh ingredients.... just what the heart doctor ordered.  There were bigger ones on the menu but.. since i had just had lunch i thought a taste would sell me or not....and it did. From the reception this chain has gotten, i'd say their game plan is a winner and i can't wait to go back and try some of the other goodies for a more complete experience.  Now.. if White Castle would only make an appearance. But i think Culvers will give In & Out a fight for the burger buck in this town. Both are worth the trip though !

This is place has gone from barely tolerable to downright sucks. Been meaning to write about our last visit there. A friend and i decided to go for lunch. The bar waitress suggested the meat loaf with cheddar sandwich special so we went for it.  The sandwich came out (with the wrong fries) and it was about an inch thick and the cheese looked like it was spread on not a nice slide of fresh cheddar.  The meat loaf was so so with no flavor and we ask about if they had meat loaf on the menu. She said this was from last night's meat loaf special dinner. OK.. now we know that our meat loaf is a day old and then when the bill came THE REAL SURPRISE. $13 for a thin poorly made meat loaf sandwich.  Our bill was over $28 for a couple of bad sandwiches and ice tea.   I hate not having good food when i go out but when you go somewhere other than fast food and you pay through the nose, you expect some sort of quality. This can NOT be a place we'll ever go back.  We just heard this week that the place is going to go German and start selling that food. Maybe Germans have less taste requirements than we do but if they don't do it any better than the meat loaf... watch for the new VACANCY sign that'll be out when the owners run out of savings.  We're running out of places to eat here in Cave Creek but better to not eat at all than to come here.  PS - There is a Dairy Queen down the street just in case.

Well.. the death song is again being sung at this place i fear. Another concept change? Come on guys get something good and stick with it. There's a revolving door of foods, menus, concepts and thought patterns going through this place "where neighbors meet." Actually, I've run out of neighbors that will go to this place any more.  One thing about the food biz - can you say CONSISTENCY? Every time we've gone there the last few months it's something different or the menu has changed again. (and I'm still pissed at that day old 1/4" meatloaf sandwich for $13.) Things go on, things come off. The food is wondering around somewhere between Frankfurt spaetzle and California pasta with some burgers and garlic pizza thrown in just to make sure they cover all the culinary bases.  This place could be cool with an outdoor patio good to enjoy the weather, some TVs and  a big screen (although the cage fighting is a bit much during our dinner), and some of the bartenders are good although drinks are inconsistent from one to the next. (geez i hate that Pope lime mix - buy some limes and do some fresh sour mix for change)  Anyhow, for our group, we'll find another place to hang until this place changes hands and someone with actual food and management experience takes over and gives the area what it wants. Hate to see places go by the way side but then again, why spend money when you don't know what you're getting from one visit to the next.   With this place I'm always afraid our next visit will feature corn dogs on a stick with spinach and clam based BBQ sauce.  Good luck guys.

And.... another one bites (the dust). Well... I'm giving up on this place as well. I'm not sure what's up with Cave Creek these lonely days but the food and service suck more and more every time you go out to eat.  I've ridden this horse through the early days, its closing, name change, the neighborhood bar scene, the "Let's eat German and polka" phase, and now the "let's try the bar scene (with just a little German food)" days again.  I was ready to find this as a home away from home but two times ago when i was there, the 7&7 was more like 3 .5 & flat sprite. So i ask about it and she more poured a normal drink. Shouldn't have to ask.  Then this last time, same thing except when i ask about the 4 count pour she said "oh yes" so either she counts fast, can't count, or they're filling their bottles with something other than what I'm used to after 40 years of 7&7s.  The burger (requested medium well cause i hate mooing) was still red and mushy in the middle and I hate - GET THIS - HATE mushy limp fries. They're called french FRIED for a reason.  Then to finish off our waitress experience of the year (hey it's only Feb.) she asked to close out our bar tab cause she was going home or something. BUT... she was still working 20 minutes later and I've never had a bill closed out in the middle of drinks and dinner. They keep tabs open and split it up later UNLESS you want to cheat the new girl and take all the tip for yourself.  Anyhow... weak drinks, continuous poorly prepared food, and I'm just not that thrilled with the place anymore. Too bad, they have a patio but...maybe they're more interested in the biker crowd.  I've revisited this place so many times to give it a shot.... I'm sick of looking at it through my rear view mirror. Maybe the next owner will have some techniques and consistent standards.  I love Cave Creek as a town ( i think) but wish CC had more - no make that ANY - good places to eat. They either close or remain open past their time.

Having spent many a happy hour and dinner time at this location when it was Joe's, we anxiously awaited the remodel and new opening. They did a great job of opening up the inside and the patio is a super nice environment for eating outside (despite the motorcycle noise on the street). The place was full with people giving it a try and time will tell if the crowds continue to flock. Having been in food i know the need to build "activity and excitement" in a place so it doesn't seem like a morgue with classical music however.... with so many hard surfaces in this place (walls, floors, ceiling, tables, etc.), the noise level almost made it impossible to hear someone 3 feet across the table. Think about some softer items somewhere. Even in Italy they hang tapestries.   As my companion said, "nothing to make me really want to come back."  Let's face it, there are more Mexican and Italian places around than you could eat at in a year, so there's got to be something special to make you revisit other than location. I was disappointed enough to have the same feeling after such anticipation.  First, I hate when restaurants are so pretentious as to bring out your "portion" of wine in a small carafe and pour it into a large glass (that seems the size of a football next to the portion) hoping you'll be impressed with their effort to dirty another container on your behalf. Sorry, just pour a nice glass of wine and bring it out. And it really does makes the portion look small. I'd rather have the wine than the experience. OK, it's a personal thing.  Second, as a test of new places, especially Italian, I try the Caesar salad. Not sure why but it's always been an indication. Well... Disappointment Central. I hate sending things back but there was as much taste as one might find chewing on their gym socks - maybe less. If there was any garlic at all, it's only cause it was walked through a room with garlic on a counter. You can usually taste the tang of the lemon juice...not to be found. It was a real disaster and I'm sure the creator is spinning in his grave somewhere in San Diego. If you like Caesar salads... I'd pass on this one.  Next, I wanted to try something different so I jumped on the Short Rib Ravioli. I'm always up for something new but maybe good short rib meat shouldn't be chopped, mushed and pureed. For some reason, the taste and texture belonged in a old age facility for people with no teeth. OK, I like my meat with texture and chunks. I guess the other thing was that the very rich beef stock sauce combined with the filling was really overwhelming. It would have been great over a nice charred steak with mushrooms and onions but on delicate pasta? Not so much. I've had great sauces and unique items and fillings at some terrific places but sometimes it just doesn't fit. Move on.  And overall, the waiter must have been extremely new (like 5 minutes?) as his attention to guests and quick, relaxed knowledge of things wasn't there. We deliberately waited a bit before showing up here so as not to get caught in the grand opening fray and to let things settle in a bit. Staff training is PARAMOUNT in a place of this projected level.  My last thought is about pricing. Italian and Mexican food places can be among the most profitable. After all, their menus are mainly based on less expensive commodities of rice, beans and flour. I was hoping this was a nice normal affordable place to sit and eat and enjoy some quality yet casual Italian love from the kitchen in a nice friendly neighborhood eatery. We didn't want to pay over $75 or $100 to do it. OK, they have to recoup the money put into very nice wall coverings and lighting and it is a nice atmosphere but... don't do it all on my check.  I never want to be unkind and maybe I should cut the owners some slack but hey... this isn't their first place so experience should count for something. Anyhow, with all that said, it might be worth a return visit to try their pizza which comes out of a nice looking wood burning oven. i'll update later as the motivation strikes me to repeat.   Just keeping it real!  And get rid of those little carafes.
