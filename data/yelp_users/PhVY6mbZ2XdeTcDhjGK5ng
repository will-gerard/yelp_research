Flavorful crust but low quality toppings leave pizza greasy. Huge slices but unappealing bites.

So I came to this place up the street from my house and immediately noticed that you can seat yourself. I'm not sure if this was because it was later in the day but it was nice to not have to wait. My sever came up and immediately took our order. Small irks here, I have a six year old and he can be clumsy, as most six year old are. So I was surprised that she gave him a giant cup with no lid. Also missing a kids mat with kid items.  I can see across my table and see a child about ten with one but not my little guy. That's fine,  ordered him a blueberry pancake. I ordered the southwest biscuits and gravy (they had me at chorizo gravy).  First off his pancake was buttery and slightly nutty and giant. Fresh blueberries sprinkled within the pancake add a nice burst of flavor. I have a good feeling the lemon blueberry pancake would be an even better choice. The warm maple syrup is a nice touch as well.   My southwest biscuits and gravy were not bad. The biscuits while tender were pretty flat. Not enough baking powder I'd imagine. The eggs were perfect and the potatoes were delicious. Flat coins that were crispy while being fluffy in the center. The chorizo gravy had good flavor but had very little actual meat in it. The homemade sausage was a good thought but didn't have as much punch of spices as your store bought variety. The menu has me intrigued enough to come back. Also very good hot sauce collection.
