I was referred to Camelback Women's by my primary doctor. I called to schedule an appointment and the office receptionist was not friendly at all. She also had a tone like she was annoyed that I was asking questions... long story short I did not schedule my appointment with them and I can see that others have had a similar experience.

Friendly staff, caring doctors and you can't beat the welcoming feel the "cats only atmosphere"!   I first visited Scaredy Cat when my son Oliver was very sick. When the doctor first saw him it was if she could tell just by looking at him what was really going on inside of him. She made some expert recommendations but we found that there was nothing we could do and I later had to lay to rest. (sorry to make you sad)  The staff and doctors were so supportive and caring it made it as easy as it could be for a parent at such a difficult time.  ... I was truly so glad I found them.  Years later I decided to add another kitty in my life (her name is Snow) and I can't imagine taking her anywhere else! You definitely need to to use them for your felines primary care physician!

Went there on a Tuesday night, the staff was very friendly but we had a really long wait for the teppanyaki chef. It was kind of a bummer. The manager came over, apologized and offered the table free edamame. I'm not sure if they had more parties come then expected or what but it was really nice that the manager went out of his way to try to make us feel comfortable.  The food was delicious! I highly recommend the fillet, calamari or scallops. I tasted some of the Chateaubriand and in my opinion the fillet was just as flavorful and tender.

I've eaten here a few times and everything I have had has been delicious! The pizza is very tasty, the wings are very flavorful without being greasy and the ribs... Are some of the best I have ever tasted! Oh and you have to order the cannoli!!!

I'm sorry to write this review because I don't like to give negative feedback.  The way you order was unconventional and it didn't flow right.  The place seems grimy. The way you get and add additional products was below standards. There was LITERALLY a man with "hygiene" products (QTIPS & ECT) at the table next to me... carefully laid out on his table and YES he DID use them while I was there waiting for my food! I will not be back

This place is ridiculous! I placed a to go order and arrived when I was supposed to then waited for 15 mins in a small crowed waiting area just to pick up my order. They really need more help at the front during peak dinner hours. I will not be back

I was being super lazy tonight and ordered grubhub delivery from joyful dining tonight. I was a little skeptical based on some other previous reviews, but live very close to the location and was interested in trying it anyways. I will tell you I ordered the crap puffs, crispy duck with fried rice and barbecue pork slices... They were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing! I was hesitant on the way I would have received my food, but when it was delivered to my location the duck and crab puffs were still crisp! And everything was still warm! They did an amazing job! Everything tasted fresh and had very good flavors I would honestly recommend this place to anyone and will come back again! This is the longest review I've ever made because I really felt like this please deserves it! :)

This place has been in Scottsdale forever and I can tell why. I've been here a few times, each time the staff has been very friendly and accommodating, their salsa is bomb and I recommend the steak fajitas!

I would recommend Bob's TV repair to my family, friends, coworkers and anyone! I have actually had the pleasure of using their service twice and both times they have equally impressed me!  Especially Steve!  He has been so knowledgeable and helpful both times! Thank you Steve!

Let me start this off with... I have been to my share of "high end resorts" for all types of massages, I have also been to the "local chains"... This Hand & Stone location is phenomenal! ...I found this massage location by searching the yelp for places that I could book online, then saw the good reviews and wanted to try it. When I first walked in I was pleasantly greeted by two staff members, everyone walking out of their appointments seemed sooo happy, the awesome front desk receptionists (Jill & Susan) set my mind at ease by explaining the massage session and how this appointment was "all about what I would like out of it!" (kudos to the customer service!!)  ... I had my massage with Nicole, she was another hidden gem! Her different massage techniques were top notch, she then continued at points to ask if the pressure level was pleasing and that massage was satisfactory to me. The whole experience was of the highest quality and I will defiantly be back! Thanks ladies!!!     .

They mess up my drinks all of the time. I only come here if I can't plan another location in my route.   It's like all Starbucks as a whole though. I wish they would train their Baristas to ALL make the drinks the same so you know how to order your drink. Example: some are SUPER stingy on the Carmel... even when you ask for more! Then there's some that give you a good amount so when you order extra with them they over do it.  It's a stupid thing to complain about based on everything else going on day to day but when you spend 6+ bucks for a cup of coffee and you are expecting it to be made the way you know you want and don't get it.... It kinda bugs you.

Jim's reading was amazing! I was blown away on how accurate his information was with out me telling him a word about myself or my life! I saw Jim a few months ago and everything he told me then was true and everything he said for my future has come true as well! I would recommend him to anyone! He is very friendly and truly has a gift!!! I am a customer for life now! Thanks Jim!  Tracy

I want to start off saying that I feel bad having to write this review, but I will not be coming back to this place and if management cares then they should know why. First off the girl behind the counter seemed nice but she was wearing a tank top that had the sleeves open and her bra was halfway exposed. Which is fine when I am out at a bar... but I didn't appreciate it at a smoothie place.  Second while the girl was making my drink another customer walked in and she decided to take his order while making mine... which was fine but when I went to hand her my card for payment she then asked me to wait so she could make the other persons DRINKS (not just one) as well.   I don't understand why she did this and I was in a hurry!   Third, she then took the other customers money, rang him up, cleaned up sightly before finally ringing me up!!!!! I don't know if she didn't realize what awful customer service this was or what??!

The Pho was very delicious but I was not that impressed with the #16. Helpful tip, do not order over the phone the person answering does not understand english very well, even when trying to order with just numbers.

I reviewed this place on yelp along with reviewing the menu online. I will tell you the first time I picked up Togo from this place in a Sunday and I was completely blown away!!! And would have rated five stars! I ordered the beef brisket with macaroni and cheese, substituted cole slaw for green beans w/an up charge (which is fine and understandable). The brisket was perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly! I enjoyed the macaroni cheese it was very cheesy and it had a nice crust of extra cheese and seasoning on top of it. I was also asked if I wanted tortilla or a bun and favored a bun which was also butter and toasted amazing! The overall ordering was very similar to how it look like online.The flavors were amazing and I was completely sold on the place.   I went back two weeks later on a Saturday and had a completely different experience. When I ordered they didn't seem to understand the menu the same as the Sunday person did which was fine but I still order a very similar meal the only change was corn vs green beans. I was not asked on my bread vs tortilla option but honestly forgot about it since I was distracted about switching corn for Cole slaw.  When I received my meat I was upset because this time it was very fatty, I didn't receive tortillas or a bun, the macaroni and cheese had none of that amazing flavorful crust or additional seasoning overall it was not the same meal I was completely discouraged and have not eaten here again. I didn't talk to the management about it because I felt uncomfortable with the whole situation. I would not like to be tattling on anyone but was honestly bummed about it.

I found them on Amazon where they have 5 out of 5 stars and I can see why! If you are like me I believe "you get what you pay for" and it's so true with this company! The gentleman that came to mount my TV on my bedroom wall were very professional, friendly and used their time efficiently. I am very pleased with the final result and will recommend them to everyone I know! Thanks guys!!!! :)

I downloaded something from a website that  a friend recommended and then my computer started acting crazy! I couldn't even look at a webpage because of these weird pop ups appeared and I couldn't remove them. I was freaking out!   I went to yelp because I know nothing about fixing computers, called a couple of places and was so pleased when I called Nextcare. The gentleman that assisted me calmed me down, told me their procedures on how they could take care of it and encouraged me to bring it into their shop. He even gave me advice about the current antivirus system I was using is not really good for my computer. After picking up my computer a few weeks ago I can attest that it is completely fixed! The new antivirus system I am using works great and I'm so glad I found someone I can trust to work on my computer!

Love this place! Not going to lie one of the ladies that works here is a "little rough" around the edges but I think she may not realize how others may perceive her.. Lol I was grandfathered into this place from another tanning salon which I was in love with! Since I have been here the ladies have made me feel welcomed but be aware this comes with a price tag! Overall the beds are what I like and the location fits my needs!

VERY HIGH quality ingredients that evoke true Italian home cooking your family would make. The gentleman that greats you makes you feel at home, that you have his undivided attention when speaking to him and that he has a genuine satisfaction in service to his patrons.  Overall I am very pleased with the standards they uphold and have visited this location frequently. I would recommend them to my family and friends!

What a horrible experience! Went to grab a peanut butter cup smoothie after a movie. The smoothie tasted like nothing but chocolate, banana and ice. There was no peanut butter flavor whatsoever! While scooping with a spoon, I discovered a large clump of peanut butter the size of a fist. I brought the smoothie back to the counter and asked them to re-blend it. The girl said that she would remake it for me. She still could not get the peanut butter to blend, then asked for assistance from the other employee, who decided that pouring tap water into my smoothie was a good idea to solve the problem. At that moment, I was done and asked for my money back.

My daughter and I went in there yesterday for lunch. I asked for a sushi roll to be made a specific way and they were able to complete that perfectly! All the food was really tasty and the service was really nice! We will definitely eat her again!
