Avoid this location if you can. Came here to pick up some tracking, paid, and upon trying to load it into my car, I realized it was just a couple inches too long.. So I came back inside and asked if anyone there could cut it for me, and the employee told me "sorry, we don't have anything here to cut that evenly." I explained it wouldn't completely fit in my car, hoping he would suggest an alternative or help me in some way so I wasn't stranded in the parking lot.. Instead he stared at me blankly. So I walked out and asked another employee if he could help me tie the trunk down and secure everything, and then he told me he "had no idea how to tie anything down and would grab his manager." Ten minutes later I am finally on my way.. Thankfully someone was there to finally help me out.

First off, we come here often and have enjoyed eating here for the most part, but now I'm not so sure we will be back.. We ate here tonight and all of the food was pretty decent, but one of us got food poisoning from the raw salmon and/or raw tuna..  We really look forward to the sushi buffet, but after tonight, never again!

Tomo has great ambience and great food, however my only complaint which seems to be a problem every time I visit is their service is horrible! One time we waited for  15 minutes after being seated for our drink order. A few days ago our waitress was very nice, however she completely forgot half of our order. And when reminded she still didn't come back with everything, so we told her again. I understand things get hectic, but this seems to be a reoccurring problem, even when they are completely dead..  But again, great food, which is why we keep coming back..

There's always something that has been disappointing at Tomo. Our last experience our waitress forgot our food, but we looked past it because of how yummy it is.   Our visit tonight was a mirror image of last time. She forgot our rice again, and brought the check at the end of our meal. The check included the rice and I told her we never received it. Instead of asking if we still wanted it, she just apologized and just took the receipt back to take the rice off.   I'm sorry tomo, but we are breaking up.

If you want your beloved pet to have a great experience at the groomers, go to See Spot Clean! I've been going there for over a year and a half and love their facility! Its spacious, clean, and friendly. They even have a self serve tub which is convenient! Its also nice that my dog gets to have playtime when he is there, instead of being couped up in a crate the whole time. They even use all natural organic shampoos and conditioners! Highly recommended!

My fiancé just came back from getting his hair cut from karma, and holy hell did they do an awful job. Unfortunately I do not know who did it, but I'm guessing they don't cut men's hair often. From what I have gathered from his experience the hair stylist had a hard time taking the time to fully understand what type of haircut he wanted..  and as a result he (and I) and super disappointed and upset with his botched haircut. Never again!

I got the Classic Smash burger and it was delicious, my only complaint is the bottom bun was almost soaked as soon as I got it. Oh, and if you eat here you have to get their smash fries, soaked in olive oil, rosemary, and garlicy goodness!

Fiancé and I decided to give this place a try. We ordered the medium hot wings, and a thin crust pizza with pineapple and half mushroom. The food was very good. I would definitely come back for one of their lunch specials.

For the most part, their sandwiches are delicious, as long as their staff is paying attention!    Earlier this week, my fiancé and I picked up sandwiches to go, only to find out once we got to work that his was made incorrectly. We called and asked if they would be willing to deliver the correct sandwich to our business which was located less than a mile away, (if we didn't have to be at work we would have just taken it back) however they told us policy wouldn't allow them to do that and we would have to come to their location with receipt to make sure they actually made it. That's understandable, inconvenient, but I understand business's have regulations.. We decided to let it go.    We tried it again tonight, thinking our previous experience was a fluke. And once again, took our food to work, and my sandwich was completely incorrect. This time we brought it back.    IF I ever want to eat from here again, I'll make a point to open up the sandwich and check before I leave the store since the employees do not pay attention to customized orders.

What a treat to have a store like this in phoenix! My fiancé and I stopped in today and loved the different wet specimens, insects and skulls. The owner was very accommodating with all of our questions and seemed extremely knowledgable about everything.   My only wish is that the store was a little larger, but even for a smaller space there was a large array of neat critters to look at.  I picked up a butterfly display, and can't wait to come back since they update their inventory frequently.

I've heard some not so great reviews about the Core Institute, but I'm thankful that my experience has been nothing but positive. The staff that I've encountered have all been friendly, as well as my doctor, Dr. Patel. I broke my wrist and they have went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and informed about all my questions.

This review is strictly for the bar!   My fiancé and I have been here about four times now since it's opened. The atmosphere is fun and we enjoy the games and food. If you're headed to the bar make sure you keep an eye out for Libby! (She is easy to spot as she is covered in tattoos! :] )  Not only is she friendly and talkative, but she is great at multi-tasking and very very attentive to everyone. Thank you Libby for the awesome service!
