I just needed a basic 2 way alarm installed. They quoted me a price over the phone and stuck with it. If you value your automobile don't trust it with Best Buy or Audio Express. The alarm was installed quickly (4 hours) and they took the time to hide the components. The only thing I didn't expect was the receiver to be taped (two sided) to the inside of my windshield. I understand this is the best location for reception so no big deal. Guys are friendly and have plenty of good products to choose from for audio, video and security. I will be back when i am ready to upgrade my factory speakers and add an amp!

Great selection, good prices and good old fashioned service. While I was working with a lumber professional we were interrupted by another customer. Thankfully the rude customer was basically sent packing while he finished answering my questions. I will be back and leave my sense of humor at the door as they seem to be all business. I can live with that as they provide me with what I need. Looking forward to my first furniture project with some inexpensive Alder.

BC Automotive has been my families mechanic for 12+ years. They have always provided us with free diagnostics and quality repairs. They are not the cheapest mechanics on earth, but they offer great work for fair prices. It is hard to find honest mechanics these days, but Barry and company give us hope.

If you like Dominos, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, New York Pizza Dept or any of the 1000 different pizza places in Arizona then don't bother stopping at Prima Pizza. Prima Pizza is the real deal! Hands down I have not had better pizza anywhere in Arizona. You will not get fancy seats or sexy waitresses in fact some of you might find the owners to come across a bit grumpy. Don't let it fool you this is home made pizza from some great guys that know how to cook. I highly recommend the pepperoni pizza well done and the steak special sandwich. Let them cook it and make it how it was intended to be made and I would be shocked if you did not fall in love with it. Visit 2, 3 or maybe 5 times and eventually the owners will start to give you the attention you have to earn. Sometimes I go twice a week and I never get tired of it. If you are from back east this is a place that will remind you of home. Just go and try the dang pizza. My entire family loves it and about everyone at work goes there regularly even though it is out of the way.

I come here on occasion on Friday mornings to enjoy a breakfast burrito and order my dog a patty. I have always been treated well and the food is always as expected. Can't wait for the summer to be over it is just too hot here for only outdoor eating.

it has been over a year since I visited this hole of a restaurant, but my experience is what counts. The staff was confused and slow to visit our table, the pizza might be the most boring bland pizza I have ever had. The soda didn't taste right and the place was a total mess. To top it off the price was a bit high for something that can't even compete with Peter Piper. I would not go back to Grimaldi's if someone gave me a gift card. Try Prima Pizza sometime ... behind the Taco Bell on Val Vista and Baseline. It is a dive, but the pizza is simply amazing.

Always friendly, always consistently good pizza. Compared to all the Red Bricks I have visited this is the most customer friendly.

Live in a rental and needed someone to come take a look at a dishwasher that was not working. I watched the tech and he determined it was the float pretty quickly. He cleaned it up and secured it better from the bottom of the unit. Tech was quick and professional the only complaint I have is I never received a receipt. I would certainly consider using them again.  Update: I had the receipt just found it in my email :-)

Our family has used Action Ride Shop for paddle boards, skis, snowboards and for buying various clothing and gear for years. Their customer service has always been good, the prices are fair and the stores ambiance is hip and fun. I recommend Action Ride Shop to anyone anytime.

I went with some friends and made the mistake of ordering french toast. The bottom was not cooked and tasted like raw egg. I asked for it to be replaced with waffles which turned out to be a bit floppy and not very tasty. I tried my wife's chicken and it was okay. I don't know why I would go back.

Tried Spencer once...will no make that mistake again. Mesa TV & Appliance is a great place to spend your money if you need electronics or appliances. Don't give you money to big chains...support small community businesses.
