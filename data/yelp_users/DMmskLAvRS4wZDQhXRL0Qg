Charity "the cashier" was extremely rude to me today. Over the past several years I've bought about 90% of my ski / boarding gear here. The selection is pretty good so it kept me coming back. But after today, which topped all other relatively bad employee experiences I've had here, I will be buying else where from now on. For some reason the cashier decided it was acceptable  to call me rude. As a business owner, I would never condone my employees calling a customer rude, and I was not being rude. Retaining employees that give customers grief is just bad for business.

To start off... BOOOO!!!  I called in and made an 8pm reservation for 3 people. My daughter and I were meeting my husband up there, we were in separate cars so the arrival was going to be staggered by approx. 10 minutes. I checked us in for our reservation at 7:48pm at the hostess stand and the hostess said they would seat us when my husband arrived. My 3yr old daughter and I had to wait outside. This was no big deal as we were about 10 minutes early anyways. I did however express that I would like to put in my daughters order asap so the sooner they could seat us, even if my husband had not yet arrived, the better. She needed to eat and I would have liked a starter and a drink while we waited for my husband to join us. Any how, we waited until he arrived at 8:00pm and I was given a choice of two four top tables, one was upstairs and one was down stairs. I chose the upstairs table for convenience as I have a little one and it was a bit quieter up there.  They sat us at our table, gave us our menus and left us to choose our starters, drinks etc.... Who I thought was the waitress, thinking my order was going to be taken, ends up being the hostess who returns about 5 minutes later and proceeds to ask us to move to a 2 top that is right next to the table we had been seated at. As there is 3 of us I was a bit confused, she said there had been a goof up and that the table we were seated at was reserved for a party of 4 that had not yet arrived but would be coming in in the next 10 minutes. I'm pretty taken back by the situation as I had an 8pm reservation for 3 people and was already seated. She then started saying that I only had a reservation for 2. I  asked her to check the reservation book as it should clearly show that I called and made a reservation for 3 at 8 pm. She said rudely that I had done some sort of  web check in for 2 and never even went down to check the reservation book.   At this point I'm just baffled at how someone could be arguing with me about something like this as they had already seated us and did not seem to have this issue when I arrived or when they seated us. So she is still asking us to move to a 2 top when we are still clearly 3 of us. Then she says we would have to wait for another table unless we moved to the 2 top. I then asked her again if she would go back and check the reservation book. At this point I was still willing to over look the weird situation at hand but was not willing to be moved to a less than accommodating table. The other hostess then returns and goes thru the whole thing all over again making us feel just awful, my head was spinning and the situation became awkward and even more so uncomfortable. Finally after the rude, disrespectful and aggressive treatment I asked the young lady if she would like us to leave so the other party could be seated when they arrived. I think she finally realized how nonsensical they were being and snidely said no that's OK, but I hope you enjoy your dinner and huffed off.   My husband and I had had it and decided to leave. No restaurant has that great of  food that any one should ever just accept this kind of treatment. I looked around and there were a few other empty 4 top tables that we could have either been moved to or that they could have placed the other "non present" party at. No matter how good the food might have been, the meal we never got to order was already ruined. We have heard mixed reviews regarding the food here but wanted to give it a try any ways. Bad Idea.  We live in the area and regularly frequent many of the restaurants in the neighborhood and have never, I mean never been treated with such disrespect and horrible unforgivable customer service. I can not even begin to describe how disrespected and demoralized we felt. So on our way out we let the manager know that we would not be staying and that they could take their table and give it to whom ever they wished.  We were walking to our car and this lady is chasing after us trying to apologizing for the mishap. We were clearly really upset and unhappy with this awful situation. I told her that it was a little too little too late and I let her know we did not wish to have a conversation regarding the situation. She insisted that we talk with her and she would not stop trying to speak with my husband, I finally had to ask her to leave us alone. I mean really, we are not happy, we left and are completely disgusted at what had occurred and she continues to ramble on like it is going to change what had just taken place.  All I can say is what happened to customer service?? And just because a restaurant is busy at the moment and appears to be doing well it does not mean that their employees can treat their patrons with such blatant disrespect. I have seen a lot of restaurants come and go over the years around here, some have had really good food, some not, but not at any time have we ever encountered this kind of treatment.  We will not be returning here.

What a pleasure this was for mothers day! I'm going back for Easter next year..... The bottomless bloody marys  and mimosas were worth the $29 alone. Not to mention the raw bar, omelets, prime rib and various other yummy food they had around. The dessert selection was incredible! The district is a great event place for sure. One of my biggest things is service and they really nail it. Top rate venue even with small children.

I like it! Great music, great food.   The artichoke dip was a very nice starter, the beet salad delicious, and the tacos were just melt in your mouth fantastic.  My only issue was there is no kids menu, not that what I ordered for my child was not delicious, it was just way too much food. I like it when I can go out with my kid and  get her a well rounded meal with fruit and veggies of some sort on the side. Its too bad they don't cater to the young ones the way they cater to people's dogs. I would return but probably only for lunch when my kids at school.

This place is wonderful!!! If you live anywhere in the greater phoenix or surrounding areas it is worth the drive down town. Parking is free in the parking garage with validation. The food is awesome and the service is great. The staff is super friendly and waits well on their patrons.   We started off with the pate, pineapples, some cheese, and oysters. We shared the kale salad and the crab stuffed chicken and it was superb! My 3 yr old daughter even loved her meal. I'm pleasantly surprised that everything we ate was so well prepared and delicious.  The baseball game had just let out and they were still able to get us seated in a timely manor in a spacious booth that could have easily accommodated a few more guests. Compared to many restaurants that I have been to this place really has it together with a homey and welcoming atmosphere. I have to give the arrogant butcher 5 stars!!! I feel fortunate that the events of the evening had landed us here for a fantastic dinner.  I will happily return here with friends and family in the near future.  Thank you for the fantastic experience and great food!!!

If i could give more than five stars I would. This woman can clip and color like no other. The pricing of services is reasonable as you get what you pay for, great service! I have very curly hair and she does not do the typical butcher job that most hairstylists do to hair like mine. The salon space is clean and enviting. The products used are top notch. I have only great things to say about the business and the stylist (Rachel) she is very pleasant and does what "you" want in the best way possible. I would trust my hair with no one else.
